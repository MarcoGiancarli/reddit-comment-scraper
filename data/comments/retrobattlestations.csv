I remember my dad took me to the computer science building at Rutgers University back in the mid-1980s and my experience had been with the 5 1/4"" Commodore 64 and Apple ][ drives. I saw some older 8"" floppy disks hanging on the wall, I guess either as mementos or they were just hanging there for storage.   I also remember that the hard drives looked like big top-loader washing machines, and the disk platters themselves (which were 12-14"" diameter) were removable. But they were loaded in trays, so I wouldn't call them floppy disks."

They didn't seem so big when you got used to them.  Larger capacity than 5 1/4.  The drives weighed a ton and had a scsi-like 50pin cable + unit number selector.
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,roboplegicwrongcock,3,Tue Jul 21 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"2 recommendations:  1) I think your bottleneck will be disk access.  The processor is ok for light work, you've got a decent amount of ram, and you have the video card.  An IDE SSD will do wonders and really help the speed.  $75 or so for a 128gb IDE SSD on ebay.  Use that for the OS and your applications, and then put files/media/backups on the 80gb.  2) A nice $10 upgrade would be a USB2/Firewire PCI card.  USB1 is painful - USB2 is a lot more tolerable.  Those can be found on ebay as well. (I just bought one for $8 shipped).  I totally agree with thereddaikon - for 95% of what you'll be playing with - a faster individual processor will trump the duals - so don't pay extra - and in most real world apps you won't see a difference.  Unless you are doing Photoshop/Aftereffects - which on a machine of this era would be a bit of a challenge, and even then it won't be that noticeable.  So what were your plans for the machine?"
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,thedangerman007,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:50 2015 UTC,Well the first thing and probably easiest thing you can do is up the ram. The AGP models accept up to 2GB of SDRAM. I would also look into upgrading the cpu. Instead of getting one of the dual cpu modules though I would recommend getting one of the faster single cpu modules. The dual cpus were only really used in high end content creation applications and even then two 500mhz cpus won't equal a single 1Ghz in every day applications.
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,thereddaikon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm going to be looking for some RAM sticks.  Do you know for sure my G4 accepts the CPU upgrades? I've heard that some do, and others don't."
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,thereddaikon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:45 2015 UTC,They do but you have to be careful. It isn't as simple as taking the cpu from a later model and slapping it in most of the time. What you will want is to find one of the old third party cpu Upgrades such as Sonnet. You can find them on eBay or on apple mailing lists pretty easily. Make sure the upgrade is for your model.

This is only on certain models of the G4, and I don't know the specifics.  I also have a PCI card installed that gives me 4 extra USB ports. This is useful, since the stock system doesn't have very many."

The bottleneck I ran into was the PC133 ram.   USB card, and a better AGP card and you'd have a decent machine. a better performer than a comparable G5 even."
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,svtguy88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"I used a PowerMac G4 as my daily until about 2011 or so.  If you're open to spending some money (and some time, tracking things down), here's what I did to mine to make it tolerable for every day use:   Sonnet dual 1.8 ghz upgrade card - this was a solid upgrade from the original dual 500 mhz setup (and it cost me a hefty $300 used back in the day). 2.0 GB PC100/133 RAM (this is the max the machine will support - note that OS 9 will only recognize 1.5 GB).  Judging by your box's 400 mhz CPU, it's probably the same 100 mhz bus that I had.  I know it's possible to overclock the bus to 133 mhz, but it requires soldering (I can't find the details right now, but you basically change some resistors around).  I never did this, as I didn't think it would be worth the time, but I know there are tutorials out there. Nvidia GeForce 6200 Mac Edition - nothing special, but it more than got the job done.  I ran dual monitors, and was able to run Unreal 2k4 at ~40 FPS reliably (one monitor).  Note:  the non-Mac Edition is supposed to be compatible, but only if you flash it with a Mac ROM, and then disable two pins (Google has the details). Acard PCI SATA controller with a couple of drives - SSD's weren't really a thing when I was doing these upgrades, but the SATA controller/drives were a huge upgrade over the stock IDE setup. PCI Wireless G adapter - I don't recall the brand, but it's one of the ones that shared chipsets with the Apple Airport, so OS X had no problem recognizing it.   I had planned to get a USB 2.0 card, as 1.1 is painfully slow, but I never got around to it.  Any time I needed to transfer a bunch of data, I just did it over the network.  Toward the end, I ditched OS X (10.5) in favor of Lubuntu, as it was starting to show its age every time Apple pushed new software updates (ex:  iTunes - oh my god, that got intolerable).  It was kind of a paint to get Linux up and running (and recognizing all of my upgrades), but once it was working properly, it actually made quite a decent workstation.  Since then, it's been retired, and the parts are collecting dust.  However,  I wasn't ready to give up that beautiful case though, so I built my new PC in it (micro ATX is a pretty good fit)."
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,thedangerman007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:57 2015 UTC,Did you ever run regular old Mac OS 9 on the Sonnet dual 1.8 ghz upgrade?  That must have flown!
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,FurriesRuinEverythin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Sonnet made CPU upgrade cards for them but they're really hard to come by. You can occasionally come across apple made G4 CPUS, but you have to make sure that they are compatible. Some of the later models used the same connector for the CPU card, but they were different sized cards with absolutely massive heatsinks and fans (which are case mounted) so you'd have trouble making them fit. I was going to take the CPU out of one of my MDD PowerMacs to put in my sawtooth until I realised how different the card and heatsink assembly were.  Some models of the AGP PowerMac G4 support multiple CPUS. There's a command you can run in the open firmware to check compatibility, I can't remember the command though. But google should be able to tell you.  It should support up to 1GB of ram, I've got mine maxed out with 1GB of PC100 SDRAM. 256MB DIMMS are really easy to come by, I've got a whole bag of them. People just give them away because nobody wants them anymore.  You can get bigger IDE drives, but those are becoming harder to get now as well. I've got a 40GB drive in mine, but they come in sizes up to and over 500GB, you just have to hunt around. The biggest IDE drive I've seen is a ~700GB drive. Compact flash to IDE adaptors are a good option for storage as well - the computer will see it as a regular IDE drive. You can pick them up for a few dollars from china.   You might be able to get a PCI SATA adapter. I've heard of people using them. But again, finding a model that will work with a mac will be pretty difficult. A SCSI card is another option if you can find one.  OS wise, these old machines are better for running OS 9. I used to use mine as my main computer running Panther (and later, Tiger) back in the day and it ran like an absolute dog. But OS 9 soars on it. I'm using mine to run Rhapsody at the moment and it runs really well."
retrobattlestations,3e2knr,tdotgoat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"IMHO you should upgrade the RAM to the max(Macs love more rams), and downgrade to OS 9. The older OS runs so much better than X on those older machines.   Even if you upgrade the CPU, X will still feel sluggish.   I had a fully upgraded G4 AGP (topped out RAM, better video card, more hard drives, CPU upgrade card to 1.3Ghz), and I ended up taking the CPU upgrade out so that I can downgrade to OS 9 just because X didn't feel quite up to speed.   I think part of the problem is that the older OS X was never all that snappy compared to pre-X even with the best hardware."

The GRID central service ran on an IBM Series/1 mainframe. Applications: The high cost kept this computer, designed specifically for C-level executives, out of general use. Specialty uses included (allegedly) Reagan's Nuclear Football, and navigation on the Space Shuttle.

(The amazing early grid-proprietary Compass Computer OS)  There is a DOS option for this- it's a very custom version of MS-DOS that supports the odd display hardware and storage setup. I have it but it's not nearly as fun, nor is it PC Compatible- as the GRID was actually designed well before the IBM PC was released. This means there is jack shit for software to run on the compass even though it is MS DOS 2.  The later grids starting with the GRiDCase can run CP/M 86, MINIX, DOS etc. as they are IBM PC clones. They're not quite as oddball- but they are very high quality PCs."

retrobattlestations,3drmxr,ElementalChaos,3,Sat Jul 18 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"I love sim tower. It's one of my favourite old games. What system version is it designed for?  Oh, also, if you install OS 9 it has mass storage device support. So you can still run old software designed for classic, while having the ability to transfer files easily instead of using floppies. The UI is the same as OS 8.  I keep editing this and adding things because I'm watching the film still... I should have watched the video first.  So with the Apple menu, if you open up the hard drive from the desktop and open up the ""System Folder"", there is a directory in there called ""Apple Menu Items."" You can drop programs, aliases (called shortcuts on Windows), documents, or anything you want. Anything you put in here will show up in the apple menu.  Another trick - a more convenient way for launching applications. Open up your Applications directory, then go up to the ""view"" menu and select ""as pop up folder."" Alternatively, grab the title bar and drag it as far down to the bottom of the screen as you can. It'll turn into a a little pop up tab on the bottom of your screen. You could also make an alias to the applications directory and put it in your apple menu items directory.  Re: the screen saver. IIRC OS 8 has got screen savers out of the box. Or at least, I'm pretty sure it has a blanking feature. I haven't played with that feature for a long time. I think it can either be configured through the monitors control panel or the appearance control panel. Not 100% sure on that. I can vaguely remember there being a ""screen saver"" control panel, but it could have been third party software, or might require installing an extension from the Mac OS disc.  The other thing with your applications, is that you noted how confusing it is that some are just in the root of the drive, some are in the applications directory, some are in other places. You can put them all in the applications directory if you want to organise things, most should work fine. This was a very annoying thing back in the day. In older versions of Mac OS you would boot from a floppy. Your applications weren't on the a drive, you had to swap floppy disks around all the time. When hard drives became more common there wasn't really any established way or location to install software to. There was no standard for organisation of anything. Most people would just put things (apps, documents, etc) wherever the hell they wanted on their hard drive, essentially treating it like they would a floppy disk. Software manufacturers did the same. When OS 8 (or maybe os 7) came out, it had defined application and document directories. Older software (even some newer software) would still install where it wanted to install. But even after they added in document and application directories, people continued to put their documents wherever they wanted. It wasn't really until OS X - which provided proper directory structure and per user home directories  - that this was solved. Until recent versions of OS X a lot of people would still do this though, I often would go to do work on a computer at my job and see files and documents in the root of the drive. Now they've bumped up security and you need to enter an administrator password, thankfully.  Having to quit programs from the file menu (and later in OS X, the application menu) is a common thing people coming from PC are confused by. I think it stems from back in the early days when it wasn't a multi tasking OS and applications ""owned"" the computer while they were running. You could have one program open, but open multiple documents within it. So clicking the close button would close that particular document, but not the program. I could be wrong on this one.  I'm probably just rambling at this point, but one last thing. Mac OS X is actually pronounced out loud as Mac OS Ten. The last version of Mac OS that was produced on the original operating system line from 1984 was OS 9. Apple wanted to differentiate their product line when releasing their new operating system, which was based mostly on OpenStep/UNIX from their old mac operating system.  Rather than calling it Mac OS 10, they called it Mac OS X, the roman numeral for 10. The X wasn't intended to be the version number for the OS, rather, the name for the OS product line, but it was referencing that it was replacing the ""classic"" line as the 10th version of their consumer/client OS.   In regards to the above, a little known fact to most people is, the original version of Mac OS X (or rather, Mac OS X Server) was marketed as version 1.x, although this is a whole different OS from OS X as we know it now. It was a server OS and it was pretty much just OpenStep in disguise. When releasing the Mac OS X operating system we have now, the version number was 10.0. The 10 is completely superficial, the minor number in the versioning determines the actual version of the OS X system. Confusing as hell. We're at version 10.10 now, which means we're on version 10 of the Mac OS X line. I guess that would be Mac OS 19 if they had continued on with the numbering scheme from classic Mac OS."

It gets you more support for storage devices and fixes a lot of bugs, it runs much smoother. It's pretty easy to get a hold of a copy. If you can only get 9.0 or 9.1 there is a freely downloadable update to get it updated to 9.2. OS 9 also supports ""carbon"" applications, which was apple's short term API that let developers create cross platform apps that run natively on OS X and OS 9. It'll give you a few more options when looking for software to run. It should run OS X as well if you want to play around, up to 10.2 or 10.3, but I don't recommend it for older macs, runs like shit. Plus OS X was also hella ugly until about 10.3 or 10.4.  You can connect a 2 button mouse, which might make it easier to use coming from a Windows background.  There are some applications that you can install to make launching applications easy to use. Dragthing was pretty popular back in the day. It creates something similar to the dock in os x with multiple tabs on it that you can add things to.   If you click on the little vertical bar next to the application switcher (the icon in the top right corner) it will expand to include the current application name. If you hold down the mouse while opening the menu and drag it down it will ""tear off"" the menu and show it as a small window with buttons for all of the currently open applications, similar to the taskbar in windows.   You can configure the function keys to launch applications you assign to them as well, which makes life easy. All you need to do is press the function key while on the desktop and it should pop up with a dialogue box with instructions on how to do so.   Another useful application you can install is kaleidoscope, which lets you choose from a bunch of themes to change how the OS looks (e.g. make it look like windows, or other OSes, or other cool themes).   Also, if you're looking for games and software, the macintosh garden is a great site.  A lot of people call it OS X. I'm the Mac guy where I work, the other IT guy does it all the time and I'm always telling him off. OS ecks sounds so nasty lol"

I was in way over my head, but eventually with enough poking at a probably terribly malformed xorg.conf, I did manage to get X and KDE working. I had nothing better to do, after all. Then I played Mahjongg until I got my hands on a Windows restore disk; getting the winmodem working would have been far beyond what I could have managed if I'd even tried it.  I recall having it configured with a virtual screen that was way oversize—1600x1200 or something on my 1024x768 laptop screen—and then being too terrified that I would completely break my configuration to try to change it.

In the end I basically had no choice but to concede defeat, as any further action (whether filing an insurance claim or using eBay's money back guarantee) would result in me forfeiting the computer. I payed $30 including shipping, and while every piece of case plastic was at least partially damaged and the display was ripped from its hinges it did have the Apple 100mhz PowerPC upgrade and 32mb RAM chip, both of which still work. $30 for just those parts was a steal and there's no way I would ever be able to find them again at that price (plus everything apart from the case turned out to be undamaged and the computer works great)."
retrobattlestations,3cxpon,DontMentionLobsters,3,Sat Jul 11 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"If you're OK with keeping those parts for the money you paid, then at least leave them a scathing review since you obviously did not receive what you paid for."
retrobattlestations,3cxpon,obi1kenobi1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"I considered that, but I felt kind of guilty because I got such a steal (the seller clearly didn't know what they had in the first place, and based on what other PowerBook processor/RAM upgrades usually sell for they could be worth $100-200). Plus, I'm the one who ended discussions and decided to keep it, and shipping was literally two thirds of the total sale price so even without a refund they didn't really make any money off of it. By the time I decided I should have at least left neutral feedback telling others to beware of their poor packing skills, a few weeks had passed and I didn't want to drag the issue back up."
retrobattlestations,3cxpon,DontMentionLobsters,2,Sun Jul 12 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  On the other hand, they may just have been trying to get rid of the damned thing - I've given/cheaply sold stuff to people that I had no use for, and that was probably worth a lot more than I wanted for it, at least to them, just to get it off my hands.  Who knows - I woulda been pissed about the packing, but I guess it's all about context.   Good that you have something that's of use to you."
retrobattlestations,3cxpon,obi1kenobi1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"True, but I really don't see any way they could have known what they had. The name was wrong (""Power Book"" instead of PowerBook), the model was wrong (it said 540 but it was a 520, although without a badge the only way to differentiate them is to open them up and look at the LCD panel itself), the entire title was copied from another listing (meaning the seller used the ""sell one like this"" feature rather than creating the listing from scratch), and the fact that it had a PowerPC chip (the only reason I bought it) wasn't listed anywhere in the description or title, I just saw the PowerPC badge in the pictures and took a gamble. Roughly 1% of all PowerBook 500 models produced had an Apple PowerPC upgrade, and a fairly large portion of the chips were sold directly to users/stores as upgrades. The PowerPC badge on this computer indicated that this one was either sold as a PowerPC computer from the factory or sent in and upgraded by Apple themselves, making it even more uncommon. If the seller had any idea what they had I'm sure they would have at least mentioned the PowerPC upgrade in the description."

retrobattlestations,3cxpon,obi1kenobi1,2,Sun Jul 12 11:53:31 2015 UTC,"Well in a downright insane turn of events there was a mixup last week and another seller accidentally shipped me a PowerBook 540c instead of the 3400c I ordered. They told me to keep it (I'm guessing return shipping would have cost too much) and the 3400c should be here in a couple days. I'm not quite done yet, as this new 540c was apparently repaired at some point with a 520c passive matrix screen, but the case is in pretty great condition so all that's left is to find a replacement screen."

Not saying Matias is bad, their a great switch.  Wish more people would try Alps, really they are a amazing switch. Then we would have custom Alps keycap sets. I would kill for SA profile Alps keycaps. One day, maybe. There has been two alps GB's so far, the first one (a set) failed. The second one was just a modifier set, which was pretty successful. Just waiting out for some Alps love.  KBParadise sells Matias Alps versions of their V60 and V80 TKL.  MX Brown to me felt too light.

And the more you get rid of, the more you'll value what you kept.   Whatever you decide, know that emulation will never replace the feeling of using real hardware."
retrobattlestations,3cxgk3,psykotyk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"I've tried to find a balance, and so far, no regrets for selling off what I don't use and will probably never use (if you forgot you had it, sell it :-).  The emulation scene for the most part is strong and mostly open source, and even the Mac has many options.  I have very few systems that are not fully emulated.  Peripherals, OTOH can be an issue.  BTW, I have had great success with RPis with CRTs..  My personal favorite is the Sony PVM 2030.  Any PVM with RGB should do.  On the Pi side I use HDMI -> VGA -> VGA2RGB downscaler (GBS8100) -> PVM.  The Pi is flexible enough to get pixel perfect on the CRT.  I will not compromise on the CRT.  The PVMs also sport all the usual RCA and S-video inputs too if you want to go that route with the Pi.  Some have speakers built in as well.  Good condition PVM's go for about $100-$200, then you'll need to put about $100 into them (mostly capacitor replacement and tuning)--I don't have the skill to do this, so I take to a local TV repair shop--I should be set until I die.  That all said, the RPi emulation scene is a bit weak.  MESS e.g. isn't an option, MAME sort of works for 8-bit games (at times there are audio issues), etc...  I've decided to replace the RPi with a PC and an ArcadeVGA board (this can output 15 KHz RGB).  I'd estimate that I spend 99% of my retro time in emulators.  I've found USB adapters for PS, 2600, Coleco, NES, SNES, Apple II, etc... controllers so that I can use the proper controls when I decide to take a 5 min break and retro-game on my Mac.  I'd strongly recommend keeping your controllers, the alternatives are weak and do not provide the proper experience.  You'll probably have few regrets, and if you do, it'll not last long, and when you have more space and more coin, buy back what you miss."
retrobattlestations,3cw23p,FurriesRuinEverythin,7,Sat Jul 11 06:41:15 2015 UTC,"So I've been browsing here for a few weeks and my interest in my old hobby - collecting and tinkering with old/historic computers - has been rekindled. I used to be really interested in it, but then life happened and shit and I stopped caring, and all of my stuff just got put away in storage and hasn't been touched in years.  Today I spent the day cleaning out my spare bedroom which was being used for storing my bikes and tools, and I'm repurposing it into like a retro computer play room kind of thing. I dug out my whole collection and it's now sitting in there waiting to be played with.  Couldn't decide what I wanted to do today so I plugged in the old Colt. It's entirely unremarkable just like any other IBM clone, but I really like it because it was made by Commodore. Not many people know they made IBM clones for a short while.  Mine has been upgraded at some point in time with a Vtech EGA+ video card, it has onboard CGA or EGA (I need to check the manual) as well. 8088 CPU, XT style keyboard.   It was in mint condition, but when I left home it was stored at my mum's for a long time and mistreated by my stepdad (along with half of my collection) when moving it and it's got a damaged keyboard and is covered with dirt and dust. Pretty pissed off. But she still works fine. Missing is the commodore printer which I also have the manual for. I did have the actual printer which was cool, it had a parallel interface as well as an interface for use with a C64 or Amiga. Stepdad probably threw that out too.  I've got a huge box of software for it as well. I need to get a new 5.25 floppy drive for my old PIII rig that I use for file transfers and stuff, because the one in it has had the dick. Once I get that going I'll be able to transfer a copy of windows 1.1 onto a floppy and get it running on the Colt.  I'm gonna do a video and show what's inside, and some of the software and stuff soon.  I also have in my collection (yet to be played with today):   VIC 20 (in original damaged box) A whole box of VIC and C64 stuff (floppy drives, datasettes, cartridges, cables, etc.) But no 64 system unit (my dad threw it away - why do people have no respect for my things?) A sharp PC 7000 (a very early portable) in original (and very badly damaged) box, and original manuals and software (also damaged, another victim of my step dad) An Apple IIe (platinum)  A 512k mac (which I can't use because I have no software or mouse) and original printer (an imagewriter I think) A TRS 80 Model 4, in original (slightly dust and weather damaged (thanks again stepdad) box) and a whole heap of manuals and cassettes, and tape drive A generic 486 laptop with a monochrome LCD. I'm looking for a hard drive for it because the one that goes in it is missing. I have a bunch of IDE drives, but the smallest is a 6 GB which I don't think will work A Pentium 3 machine (mentioned before) which I have a whole shitload of old OSes on (win 3.1, win 95, beos, and a few others) which I also used for file transfers between various media types. A bunch of questionably retro macs -   g4 sawtooth (which I will demo the rhaphsody developer releases and early OS X kodiak developer releases on)   2 G4 MDD macs. Early editions, not FW800 models. I believe one of them is a dual CPU   Cheese grater G5 - most certainly not retro, but old anyway  Shitloads of old software, computer parts (SB Pro 2 in original box with discs, loads of old hdds, isa cards, etc)   I'm sure there's other stuff I've missed.

retrobattlestations,3cuarm,ZadocPaet,5,Fri Jul 10 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a pretty good article on the SpectraVideo/MSX relationship.   http://msx.ebsoft.fr/msx-genesis.php  The TL;DR is that Kazuhiko Nishi used the Spectravideo SV-328 to convince Japanese computer manufacturers that there needed to be a PC standard. Nishi had a hand in designing the machine. Once the entire Japanese industry was on board, Nishi entered into negations with Spectravideo to license their technology. However, the MSX standard ended up different enough that a license wasn't needed.   This forum post contains an excerpt from the book 'The MSX Standard: The New Computers by R. C. Wood, which gives the full version of the story. The full text of the book is available on archive.org here.    Back on topic, it would be very interesting to find out if Master System could play SG-1000 games. I know the Mark III does."

You can also measure the output voltage for the motherboard connectors when you have it up and running with the hdd, check and see if those are right. If it spins a hdd I doubt that the ps is bad.

retrobattlestations,3cgmhm,FozzTexx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's because Y/C was introduced in 1983, years before the 64c."
retrobattlestations,3cgmhm,Charmander324,2,Thu Jul 9 03:18:50 2015 UTC,Hmmm even the 64 reference manual has Luna (not chroma) (or vice versa I forget which) on the originals.

retrobattlestations,3cgmhm,MrFrimplesYummyDog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:31 2015 UTC,The Luma signal alone is still useful for driving monochrome monitors. Breadboxes built after 1983 had the more modern 8-pin video connector with true Y/C.

retrobattlestations,3chtgr,callmelightningjunio,4,Wed Jul 8 00:45:24 2015 UTC,"The AT (Clone?) Project  This is where I've wanted to get with these recent posts. It wouldn't generally be acceptable in a post to this list, as it is a pile of parts, not a running machine.  For a while I've wanted to have an AT class machine. This would fill a hole in my collection. I've got a lot of DOS 3 generation software and nothing to run it on. Back in the day I had a Taiwanese AT clone (c. 1987) which went through the typical series of upgrades -- 386 motherboard, VGA card.   Well the old parts went into a storage box. And several years ago in an attempt to clear some space the AT clone went to the recyclers -- not before I removed the disk drives though.  Thinking about putting an AT machine together I dug into the storage box. I found two MFM Drives, a disk controller card, an EGA card. A start, but far from a complete machine. So time to find a AT, or the the missing parts. I also have an original monochrome and parallel card (I used to use it for a second debugger screen), and a serial/parallel I/O card laying around somewhere but not at hand.  I knew that an acquaintance (the same that gifted me the Compaq Portable 386) had an AT (a real 5170) and an old monitor in his garage. I recently talked him out of them. The monitor was a 5151 (PC monochrome), so it wouldn't help with me wanting a CGA/EGA monitor. I forgot how big and heavy an AT was.  After getting the AT home, I got my first surprise; opening the case there were three cards just floating inside -- extended memory cards. And then the bigger surprise, no hard drive, no controller card, no drive cables of any kind.  The is a video card and a serial/parallel I/O card installed.  Powering it on, the fun continued; a brief flash of the power led, and then nothing. The AT power supply was an early switcher type that needed a good load to regulate. It has been written that it won't run without a hard drive installed, so it might be just that, or then again it might not be.  Similarly, powering up the 5151, I could hear a hum for a few seconds and then nothing. So again, unknown.  So, where I'm at:   Original 5170 case, cool Original 5170 6MHz 512KB motherboard, unknown but hopefully good Paradise EGA, flexible, can drive mono, but I still have the EGA monitor hurdle. 5 1/4"" 1.2MB floppy, good, I wanted another one 3 1/2"" 720KB floppy 3 x extended memory cards 10MHz Taiwan AT clone 1MB motherboard. I like this, if not original it does have a start screen bios setup, rather than needing a startup disk WD 1003-AW disk contoller card, and a cable that I think is the HD cable ST 251 and MiniScribe 6085 hard drives, good when stored original AT power supply, condition unknown IBM 5151 monitor, condition unknown piles of software, including backups of my drives   What I likely need next:   AT VGA card, sure would make things easier AT power supply, modern ones are available at reasonable cost and this would get past the question of what would wake up the original"
retrobattlestations,3chtgr,mustwarnothers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:46:58 2015 UTC,"For the power supply remove all of the cards from the motherboard and unplug the drives, then power is up. If the computer will power the motherboard you may have a short on a card. If the fan still jumps for a second you might have a short on the motherboard (probably a cap). The 5 3/4 floppy drive on its own might draw enough to get the ps to go.   This site always helps me when I'm working on an old ibm. http://minuszerodegrees.net"

retrobattlestations,3ccwlf,callmelightningjunio,5,Mon Jul 6 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Compaq Portable 386  This is a work in progress. An acquaintance of mine gave this to me about a year ago. It's a little out of my comfort zone as it is such a closed and specialized system. I've been playing with it on and off since.  This was a real road warrior's machine. Today we'd call it a desktop replacement. You had to plug it in to the wall, but it had a processor, storage and memory equivalent to a top of the line desktop. As such, it was fiercely expensive. Wikipedia says $12,000 to $14,000. Alas, it's day in the sun was brief. It came out in 1987. With its CGA screen and 2MB memory (without addin cards, 8MB with) it could barely run Windows 3.1 when that came out. 486 processors came out in '89 with double the speed.  A sidecar was available with space for two 16 bit ISA slots.  This example is ex-Arthur Andersen, likely obtained during their collapse. It had been stored in a unheated garage, probably since then. It was dirty, the plasma screen is flaky, the keyboard cord crumbles at the slightest touch, the floppy fails more often than not. The floppy is an odd 1/3 height design, the Canon MD-5501. Last year I could not rind a replacement floppy. Now there seem to be several available.  I've replaced the BIOS battery, removed the AA installed Windows 3.1. Installed MS-DOS 5.  If I'm going to go further I'd likely need to:   Buy a replacement 5"" floppy or install a 3 1/2"" floppy in its place. I've a 3 1/2"" drive, but need to make cable for it. Do something about the screen -- new panel (unlikely), External CGA monitor, or CGA to VGA converter. make a serial to PS/2 adapter so I can put a mouse on it. Necessary for DosShell or Windows. More memory? If I get to describing my AT project There will be some further info on this front.   The jury is out on whether I want to go further."

We used to rent it out with someone who knew how to use it for about $250/hr back in the days when that was a pretty huge amount of money for any ""PC"" networking service.

You just go into network setup and auto detect, it should pick it up.  You might need to make sure you set the correct IRQ and memory address, you should be able to find information on that for your specific card.  You will then need to setup TCP/IP as it does not come as standard.  You need to be running Windows 3.11 for workgroups.  TCP/IP-32 Should get you talking to the outside world.  As for the mouse have you got msdos mouse drivers installed?  If not Download these  About half way down the page 'I WANT A MOUSE IN DOS' section.

It appears to install fine, but this is the result: http://imgur.com/QehoyLu  Also, it appears this machine is infected with a lovely little vintage virus too. It just pounced on me after I had installed the mouse software, but I think the virus may have been on the system and dormant going by the information I've managed to find about it.  Heres the image it showed to me: http://imgur.com/Amgru2S  A simple Google search came up with this information:  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila_(Computervirus) http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/security-info/364/Tequila%20Boot/ http://home.mcafee.com/virusinfo/virusprofile.aspx?key=98230  No idea what the hell to do now!

I would suggest booting from floppy, FDISK and delete the primary partition.  Then exit FDISK and reboot from floppy.  Once back run the command: 'fdisk /mbr'  This should re-write the MBR.  Once that is done, run FDISK again and create a new primary partition, that should hopefully leave you with a nice clean machine.  Then the boring task of reinstalling everything!  As for the mouse:  Have you got the mouse plugged in the back com port or the side?  Try it in the back one, that is the one that the dos driver looks for.  Or the other way around if it is slightly different to the 3200e model.  If that does not work or you only have one com port on that model, I would think that it doesn't like the PS/2 being converted to serial.  Time to look for a serial mouse.  Where are you based?"

I also had no assembler so any machine language programming had to be done through long strings of peek/poke statements in basic. I ended up with my first PC about a year after this, a 8086 terminal that ran dos off a floppy drive.  I horse traded my way up to a 386 over the next year and then got a job at McDonald's in 96 when I finally was able to start earning real money.

The one nice thing about the C64C is that it's AV DIN connector has YC output, where the C64 itself only had only one of them.  However, many people complain that taking YC to a supporting monitor (aka ""SVIDEO"") the picture doesn't look that good.  While I have not tried this myself, putting a 600 Ohm resistor in line with Chroma tends to make the image better, is the claim.  However, it looks just dandy on commodore monitors (I'm running mine on a 1702).  The C128 also has YC on it's DIN AV connector, but reports (again, no personal experience) say it's worse than the C64C's YC."

One piece of background; I'm a 'runner' not a 'collector'. Just about all of what I have are either:   stuff I've had since new, or nearly hand me downs, or odd stuff that I've purchased in unknown or questionable condition.   And they all have some semblance of reason for using up my shelf space -- even if it might be a stretch.  First off, the newest of the bunch, my Dell Dimension 4600.  About a year ago, with the demise of Windows XP, I decided that I really needed an XP box. At the local Salvation Army I saw a box that intrigued me. A Dell Dimension 4600. It had two optical drives, and a Firewire board. This made me think that it was once someone's multimedia hotrod, and a fit candidate for me. It also had a floppy and full set of legacy ports. This would be my nearest to modern machine to have those. It also had an ominous rattle and the COA had been peeled off. But in true scavenger mode, I figured I couldn't go too wrong for $15.  Got it home and discovered that the ominous rattle was a bracket for mounting a second hard drive -- and that there was neither a second hard drive, or for that matter even a first (likely why there was no COA).  Even though it was originally set up as for IDE drives, it had a SATA controller. An unused 320MB Sata drive, 2GB DDR RAM and a cheap (but better than Intel) video card from the local Micro Center and I was in business.  Specs:   Dell Dimension 4600 (2003) 2.6GHz Pentium 4 (Northwood, 8/02) 2.5 GB DDR RAM 320GB SATA Drive NVidia GeForce FX5200 Video card (3/03)   The Pentium 4 processor is a dog, nowhere near as fast as a 2.6GHz label would make you think. I use this for playing around with XP and running my model railroad -- I've got other machines I could use, but my club's current station uses XP, so I can easily run a similar config at home.  The monitor is interesting too. It's a Philips 15PF5120/28 TV that I also picked up at the local SA at about the same time. Its a TV, that proudly states 'FlatTV' and 'HD TV Monitor'. It's got an analog tuner, but a 1024x768 panel and a bunch of inputs including DVI-I."

I just don't use it often since I have better computers to do the same stuff.   Btw, the processor in the 4700 is a 3.2GHz P4 HT, so if you think the 2.xGHz rating is a lie, the 3.2GHz is a bad joke.

Since our American friends are all hung over this weekend I thought I would help fill the sub up with a bit more content :)  I have set up a web server running on my BT Badged Zenith Systems M5000.  It has a 20Mhz intel 386SX and has 7MB’s of RAM.  I think it can only handle 4 simultaneous connections so it may be a little slow!  It is running MS DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 For Workgroups.  I am using an NE2000 compatible ethernet card in the Zenith connected up to my IBM Thinkpad T20 running Windows 2000 Advanced Server and a 10/100 switch in between as my IBM seems to hate crossover cables.  The Thinkpad is sharing a wifi connection from an old Netgear wifi dongle I bought from a charity shop for £3.  I use this to share internet to a few of my retro machines which are nowhere near my main server and office but need a wired network connection.  I had to setup Routing and Remote Access to perform NAT to the specific port 8386 as I have a web server running locally for other purposes.  The domain retronewb.uk is pointing to my router via a dynamic DNS service and I am controlling the domain records with cloud flare.  On the 386  I am running an old 16 bit version of Xitami Web Server.  I really enjoyed this little project and I hope some of you get a kick out of it too.  I will leave it up for a day or so, hopefully the old PSU will hold out!"

For some reason any higher and my connection dropped out.  This is like a dream.

This is like a dream.   You either have a horrible clock skew in one of your chips, or your cable is not properly wired (damaged insulation, disconnected ground, missing connections, crosstalk). I transfer files at 9600 baud and sometimes even faster (115200) without any problems. I am using FastLynx for this purpose, as it has a 16 bit DOS and a 32 bit windows application, so I can easily transfer files from my Windows 7 machine back to my DOS 6.22 machine easily. Installation of doom 2 was rather simple this way.  FastLynx has your typical two pane view with one side local and one side remote. You can also use it in local only mode as a two pane explorer window. it has automated scripts you can run to even make backups automatic. it has a ""remote upload"" feature, that allows you to send the client to another DOS machine that does not yet has it over a serial connection.  You can download an evaluation copy from the developers (they still support the software) and buy it for cheap there. https://sewelldirect.com/FastLynx-33-Software-Only-electronic-download  The evaluation copy is limited to 10 files and 10 MB total for each run.  Here are some of the features:   Supports a lot of protocols: USB, LPT, COM, Named Pipes, TCP/IP Supports simple username and password system (cannot restrict to certain folders, just to filter connections in general) IP address white- and blacklisting Windows client is compatible with DOS client (DOS client only understands 8.3 names) Directory compare, so you can filter for changed or missing files without copying identical files ""Fake it mode"", shows what would be done without doing anything Test mode to diagnose serial connection speeds"

However, pretty much any time a brand name is featured or mentioned within a show or a movie, the production company has to get what's called a film clearance.

retrobattlestations,3buf51,obi1kenobi1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:29:33 2015 UTC,"I like it, but the inaccuracies are driving me crazy. Just as an example, when they get the first review of the Cardiff Giant the only criticism is that the screen is difficult to read outdoors. That's a problem with modern LCDs, about the only place you could read a 1980s LCD was outdoors.  Also, does anyone know if the Cardiff Giant is based on a real computer? It's a bit chunky even for 1984 and seems to have some anachronisms like a 4:3 LCD panel and 5.25"" disk drives, so my initial thought was that it was made up by the prop department, but when they disassemble it the insides look like a genuine mid-1980s computer. Also, a few other computers/devices in the show are obviously slightly-disguised real-world products (like the rebadged ImageWriter II on display at Comdex). The majority of my collection is portables and I like to think I have a near-encyclopedic knowledge of early laptops, but I'm coming up blank. My guess is that if it is based on a real computer it must have been one of those generic designs that was sold under a variety of brands, but if it does exist I'd like to get my hands on one."
retrobattlestations,3buf51,stateinspector,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"The Giant prop was made by an outside vendor specifically for the show, but the internals could have been sourced from an actual 80s computer though."

As someone who is obsessed with early laptops I thought a lot of the details seemed off, but this scene in particular is what struck me. Having taken apart a few similar computers like my Apple //c and GRiDCase, that layout and internal structure looks exactly like a genuine mid-1980s laptop. The art department did a great job on that, even if they did get a few minor things wrong (like the 5.25"" floppy and internal hard drive on a laptop from 1983)."

The trick is to find the make and model of your floppy drive and search under ""title and description"" and search worldwide, not just in your country. ""Compaq LTE floppy drive belt"" didn't turn up any results, but once I realized the drive itself was manufactured by Citizen I was able to find a belt for a drive one model number off that looks like it will work.

The manual mentioned memory options being 1, 2, 4, or 8mb, so I assumed that would be one 1mb chip in each slot, but I can't figure out how to tell the capacity (they all have the same model (?) number, 300701-00, but Google isn't helping in this case)."
retrobattlestations,3bcy5y,Fr0gm4n,3,Sun Jun 28 04:22:37 2015 UTC,Look up the chip markings. The 424256-10 looks like a 4x256 chip. Two together make for a 256KB 8-bit SIPP.

The type of screen also makes a difference, and based on information I found online it seems like there might have been as many as six different screens available on this model. EL seems to be the most valuable followed by gas plasma, and then the LCDs (this one has a blue backlit version, supposedly the most readable LCD, but there were also yellow backlit, gray backlit with full VGA resolution, and possibly one with no backlight). The specific model also makes a difference, later ones like this 1520 aren't as valuable as the earlier GRiDCase models (which tend to have a smaller/wider 640x200 screen and single digit model number), and the Compass is super rare and valuable (those have tiny EL screens and no internal drives or battery)."

It's unfortunate that Goodwill damaged all of that pristine packaging with their labels and price tags, though.  I'm surprised that the TI-99 was just a bare system without any of the accessories or manuals, given that it otherwise looks untouched.  There's tons of reference material on the internet to compensate, though: Mainbyte.com has a lot of great technical information, the WHTech FTP site has a wealth of software and documentation, and 99er.net and the AtariAge forums are good sites for news and discussion.  The power connector is fairly straightforward, and it should be easy to make a replacement power adapter; it should also be fairly easy to find one on eBay.  You also don't need to bother with the RF modulator: the 5-pin DIN connector on the back of the unit outputs straight audio and composite video and can be connected directly up to your monitor/television with the proper cable, which is even easier to make for yourself or find for sale."

The 2 PS/2 mice I tried wouldn't work with the RS232 to PS/2 adapter (meaning the chipset in the mouse couldn't switch down I assume.)  I got the Pangolin QM32 board working -- which is the 68030 laser show controller card, but haven't wired it out to the laser projector.  Next step is to install a sound card in it. I only have my Gravis Ultrasound classic sitting around, so that will go in it. I kind of wanted a Sound Blaster so I could run Scream Tracker and other early software.

I also have a Centronix/Parallel port ZIP drive ready to go so I don't have to worry about floppies....  Anyone know if I can pull +-1.0A from the internal battery?

There were games available for just about every hardware platform and OS in history, but that doesn't mean any particular platform was especially suited to gaming relative to other contemporary platforms.  You ought to define more concrete criteria, e.g. in terms of the number of games known to have been published for a particular platform or something similar.  There are a few items on your list that probably wouldn't make the cut, e.g. the Apple /// or the earliest versions of MS Windows.  Additionally,  some of your list ought to be consolidated: the Apple IIs, Atari 8-bits, and 32-bit Windows versions are all variations of the same platform, and run the same software."

That's the part I'm disagreeing with.  The IIgs has some drastically different hardware -- it's got a 16-bit 65C816 CPU, not the 8-bit 6502, and has completely new audio and video hardware. It's backward-compatible with the earlier Apple II series, but it's got a lot that makes it unique.    The II, II+, IIe, and IIc, on the other hand, are all different permutations of the same underlying architecture.  They differ in things like their cases and peripherals, their keyboards, the default amount of RAM they shipped with, whether certain functions are integrated into the motherboard or instead located on expansion cards, etc. but they all fundamentally work the same way, run the same code on the same CPUs, have the same audio and video capabilities, etc.    They're all the same platform, in the same way that IBM PC compatibles running MS-DOS, despite having much wider variation in hardware configurations than the Apple II series ever did, still all amount to the same common platform."

I believe at least some of the models differ in the exact chips they use and the 'enhanced' IIe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe#The_Enhanced_IIe) is at least a little different from the regular IIe because of the different cpu (although it's still technically a 6502) and the rom chips.    We'll just have to agree to disagree. They may be essentially the same, but when you consider that people had one or the other and that they probably didn't have access to upgrades the way we do now, there was much more difference between an original Apple II and an IIe enhanced than between modern PCs which can all have very similar hardware specs with the snap of your fingers."

retrobattlestations,3asinp,istarian,2,Sun Jun 28 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"Games without complex graphics (resolution, colors, scrolling, sprites) or sound (voices, octaves, waveforms) will run on most any computer.  There were only a few computers that were built for gaming as they had most or all of the features above. To me, two of the key features are sprites and hardware scrolling. The following computers had hardware scrolling:   Commodore Amiga Sharp X68000 MSX 2+ Commodore 64 (few colors) Atari 800 Atari STe (Shifter chip) Commodore 16, Plus/4 (no sprites, weak sound) Commodore VIC-20 (low resolution, few colors, no sprites, weak sound)   The Atari ST did not have hardware scrolling. You can see this by comparing Atari ST games with the Amiga versions. The Amiga versions will have smooth scrolling, while the Atari ST version will typically have page flipping.  Some Atari ST games do have scrolling but it is done by the CPU and is typically sluggish compared to the Amiga versions. Some games were originally written on the Atari ST and then lazily ported to the Amiga without using the Amiga's features. These Amiga games will have page flipping or sluggish scrolling.  Here is a video showing a game that pauses the game while the screen scrolls on the Atari ST, but scrolls smoothly on the Amiga. The Amiga version starts 15 minutes in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od0-UKIWprc  The MSX 2 had only vertical hardware scrolling.  Then there is the issue of software availability. The Commodore 64 and Amiga had the most software. The Atari 800 had quite a bit. The MSX 2+ and Atari STe didn't have a lot of software as most of it was written for earlier models without the enhanced features. The VIC-20 has a fair amount. The Commodore 16, Plus/4 probably has the least. I do not know enough about the Sharp X68000 to know how much software is available for it.  Of course, the 16-bit systems have more advanced games than the 8-bit systems. This puts the Amiga at the top of my list of gaming computer platforms. I put the Commodore 64 second, and the Atari 800 third. The other systems did not have lots of great games made for them.  Of course, if you don't care about existing software, the order of your list will be different.  I have not mentioned the IBM PC. At the beginning, it sucked for gaming. Of course it eventually acquired more CPU power, accelerated graphics, and good sound. As the other systems left the market, it became the only gaming computer platform. Well, there was the Apple Macintosh, but it didn't have hardware scrolling until quite late."

Also, while a bit limited in the vertical, double high res is fairly substantial (560x192). It's always important to consider what upgrades could be had at the time in addition to built-in features."
retrobattlestations,3asinp,istarian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it could be upgraded, but there are few, if any, games available which use those upgrades, like the MSX 2+ and Atari STe upgrades were rarely used.

retrobattlestations,3asinp,98digger,2,Tue Jun 30 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"Which versions of Amiga are different enough that they should be listed separately?   Wedge shaped Amigas  The 500, 500Plus and 600 use the 68000 and the Original or Enhanced chipsets.   The A1200 had a 68020 and the AGA chipset, which gave more colours and a few other enhancements. The A1200 was mostly backwards compatible with the others.  Amigas without* keyboards  The CDTV was basically an A500 in a CD player case. It has computer sockets on the back and a cdrom drive built in. If you plug a standard Amiga external floppy drive in, it will behave exactly like an A500.  The CD32 was based on the AGA chipset, but had an extra chip that was supposed to do chunky pixel mode stuff. It was a console in the traditional sense, not having computer-style connectors on the back, but there is a huge expansion socket instead. The CD32 can boot Workbench 3 from a correctly prepared CD and is mostly backwards compatible with the CDTV.  I'd say that the CD32 definitely deserves listing separately for being a different platform, but shouldn't be on your list because it is a console. The A1200 and CDTV isn't so clear.

retrobattlestations,3apmpz,Mattr567,6,Wed Jun 24 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yesss.  Definitely battlestation.  I want one of these things so hard.   I think that's a 3477 terminal (it says that, right on there, and the serial number seems to confirm it), but what's a bit weird is that I was pretty sure that was a twinax terminal, but the only connections you are showing in the photos are not twinax.  So either there are some other ports on there, not visible in the photo, or there was originally some outboard part that converted from twinax to serial.  If you want to post photos of the complete back panel, people can probably give some advice on what it'll take to connect it up to a modern host system."
retrobattlestations,3apmpz,Kadin2048,3,Mon Jun 22 23:29:51 2015 UTC,"There was this adaptor connected to the back, http://imgur.com/qiX66pf Might that be the fabled twin connector?  This is the entire back panel, http://imgur.com/lgfWN8h  Do you know what it might be worth?"
retrobattlestations,3apmpz,Kadin2048,5,Tue Jun 23 08:09:16 2015 UTC,"The terminal part without a monitor seems to go for $50 on Amazon Marketplace; refurb'ed ones with a warranty are around $250.  Not sure about the 'bay.  The problem is that corporate users with AS/400s probably aren't going to buy one from you, just a random person, they want one from a used-equipment dealer with a service contract.  So you are probably looking at selling to one of those dealers and you won't get too much, although more than most old hardware from the same era.  (In other words, it's not just trash.)  Some AS/400 collector might give you a few bucks for one, because that's where they're really useful.  Or, alternately, you could pick up an AS/400 for yourself. :)   And yes, I think that adapter is the Twinax part.  Twinax allowed a daisy-chain configuration, sort of like Token Ring (except obviously with different cable, twinax instead of coax).  So you'd expect to see two Twinax connections, in and out, the ""out"" side of which would need to be terminated if you were the end node on a line.  IIRC you can build or buy a balun to use UTP cable for short runs in lieu of actual Twinax cable, because that's sort of hard to find (although I think it's used for some exotic datacenter connections still).  Definitely keep those adapters!  I think you should be able to turn the terminals on without connecting them to anything and access some sort of setup screen.  At least on the newer ones, there's a setup interface built into the terminal's firmware where you can set the node address and some other stuff.  If there's no obvious button, try turning it on holding down the spacebar.  On older terminals there are DIP switches somewhere.  If you don't see any DIP switches, you should be able to get to the interface, which would let you at least verify that the terminals work.  N.B.: the 3477-series terminals are not compatible with 3270-type terminals, at least not without some sort of adapter unit; the 3270s are coax terminals while the 3477s are Twinax.  If you are searching around for stuff related to IBM terminals, you'll find a lot of information on the 3270 type terminals, because they were used to talk to the big mainframes.  The 3477 and similar Twinax terminals were used more for AS/400 applications IIRC.  So you'll want to look for ""midrange"" information in order to find manuals and other stuff, not ""mainframe"" sites.  I think that the 3477 might be compatible with 5250 stuff, but not really sure.  Of the ports on the back, the smaller one goes to the Twinax adapter and then the bigger one is, I believe, a pretty standard printer port."
retrobattlestations,3apmpz,Kadin2048,3,Tue Jun 23 15:47:47 2015 UTC,"Also it would seem like hooking it up to a modern system via serial is likely to be harder than I thought.  Somewhat naively, I thought that the Twinax wire protocol was the same as RS-485 or some other normal serial protocol, just with shielded cables using a single balanced pair and clocked at 1 Mbit/sec.  That's not the case, unfortunately.  It's actually a pretty funky protocol at the physical layer, because it's not balanced (no clue why) and it has preemphasis.  Producing an adapter to remove the preemphasis and convert the levels to something understandable to modern equipment doesn't seem like it'd be impossible, and might even be an interesting project, though.  There's commercial equipment that does this, but it's expensive.  It's possible that those twinax adapters that hang off the back of the terminal get you partway there, but I doubt they remove the preemphasis."

retrobattlestations,3apmpz,dtallon13,2,Tue Jun 23 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"Well, it would ""solve"" it, in a manner of speaking.  Learning how to set up an AS/400 is not a trivial task.  There's lots of forums and resources online to help you do it, but it's not like plugging in an extra PC and installing Ubuntu on it.  I think they're really neat machines and have always wanted to play around with one, but simple they are not."

retrobattlestations,3am5v3,Bounty1Berry,2,Sun Jun 21 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"This is my old CASIO CFX-9850G displaying a picture of itself displaying a picture of itself (though the second level is hard to see).  I bought this calculator as soon as it was available for sale back in 1996. It was new. It was exciting. It had a ""revolutionary"" ""high resolution"" ""color"" display and a ""high capacity"" storage memory of 32 kByte (there was a model with 64 kB, but I didn't feel like spending that much more).  The display has no less than three not very distinct colors, as well as the the ""white"" background. Each pixel can change color tone by regulating contrast, so the display does not use sub pixels to create the color. The colors are orange, blue and green, and you can manually adjust the contrast for each (and you will be doing that a lot depending on lighting conditions), making it possible to ""remap"" the palette, should you want to feel different.  I love this calculator. It got me through all of my higher educations, it is extremely solid, have a very good slide on cover and batteries last a long time. It even have a backup battery that will hold the RAM for many many years. Sure, it is slow. It is limited. It is bulky to carry around (a lot larger than a typical smartphone today). The programming language kind of is a bit sucky. It is slow. There is no assembler. And did I mention it is slow?  I built an RS-232 interface for it back in 97 or so. A simple little thing based on a MAX232 that fit inside the DB25-cover. Calculator simply uses TTL serial over 2,5 mm plugs. I do have a lot of old software and stuff for it somewhere, but most of the transfer applications back then where for DOS, and I am not sure which hard-drive all the old stuff could be on.  Instead, I connected the old interface to a USB-serial adapter and my Raspberry Pi.  After hunting around a while, I found two different utilities for transferring things under Linux, Cafix and Casetta.  Cafix was written in C and compiled from source (available with minimal documentation on sourceforge) with relatively little trouble. It worked, but was a bit limited.  Next I tried Casetta. It is written in Python, and after uninstalling Pillow, installing PIL (and messing with the library paths to make it support PNG and JPG) and finally editing a bad hardcoded path I got it working on the RasPi.  With Casetta I could not only transfer things easily, it also allowed me to automatically convert images and transfer them to the stored Picture resources on the calculator.  These picture resources are stored in a way that is a bit quirky, with four separate bitplanes stored from the bottom right and up as 16 columns of bytes with 8 pixels each. This is apparently how the display stored data internally. Usually only meant to store the contents of the screen in RAM, and later bring it up to see again, or to store a complex image that takes time to generate, and then quickly bring it up to add other contents on top. The image-resources are transferable over the serial though, and Casetta had build in converters.  Then it was just a matter of taking picture, fixing it up with the white/orange/blue/green palette in photoshop, transferring it, displaying it (I did a small program that clears the display area and recalls the picture) and then repeating it for the second level. Also, due to the 2:1 aspect of the display, I cheated a little by rotating the picture 90 degrees clockwise for each layer.  Two levels of recursion was all I did, the resolution is not good enough to go deeper.  And I apologize for the bad glare in the buttons. I should have tried to get better lightning, but I was mostly concerned with getting the screen as visible as possible."

retrobattlestations,3ajwtr,BySumbergsStache,6,Sun Jun 21 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"Oh I forgot to describe how I did it!  I wrote a Pascal program on an HP 3000 running MPE to display TIFF graphics on HP Terminals back around 1989 or 1990, when the college got the first NeXT computers and I started pulling the 2 bit TIFFs off of it. I later ported that program to C on the NeXT and added lots of features and refinements.   I did everything I could to try to speed up drawing the picture. I optimized to look for large lines or rectangles to do large fills. I even found you could define a custom 8x8 pattern that could be filled in a rectangle so I made my program look through the image to find repeating patterns.  Since it still took forever to draw the image I wanted to get it up on the screen as fast as possible so I could decide if I wanted to cancel and use different dithering options or something. So inspired by how gif was interlaced I came up with a way to do something similar in 2D so it goes through and does a bunch of far apart 8x8 areas, then steps halfway diagonally and does the same spacing, then reduces spacing, over and over, until finally the whole image is drawn."

Nope!  Its an actual 1984 model (""pre"" 128K) - no designation markings.  The logic board confirms this.  It also came with the apple-branded power cord which is surprisingly a first.

The logic board is OK though as it still chimes normally when switched on.

It was another ""untested"" eBay purchase and it works fine, although I haven't actually tested the printer or tape drive. I stared going through the user manual trying things out, and as soon as I saw that it had graphics, I knew what I had to do. :-)  This was far easier to do than I expected. As stock the 85B has no I/O other than the tape drive (not even RS232), but I had also purchased a HP-IB interface for it in another auction (which arrived a week earlier). I connected the HP-IB to my PC which has an ISA GPIB card and runs HPDrive. I told HPDrive to emulate a 9121 3.5"" floppy drive and let the 85 format a ""disk"". I then plotted a couple of things on the graphics screen and told it to GSTORE a file on the disk. Using the HPDir tool I pulled the file off and it is just a simple 1 bit screen dump and converting it only required adding ""P4 256 192"" at the top to turn it into a binary pbm.  At that point I pulled a photo of the 85B into PhotoShop and scaled it and converted it to 1 bit, inverted black & white, and then saved it out as another pbm. PhotoShop conveniently wrote it out as a binary pbm, so all I had to do was remove the ""P4 256 192"" from the top, use HPDir to put the image back on the disk, and GLOAD on the 85B."

A lot of this could have been done upstream to make life easier for the Atari, but part of the fun for me was to see how much of the job the Atari could do."

But once you're playing with GIMP you tend to just keep going.  Took the original photo and in GIMP, resized it,converted to grayscale, then indexed as monochrome and saved as PBM. PBM is a lowest common denominator bitmap format; minimal header, each bit is a 0 or 1 ASCII.  This made it simple to write an Atari basic program to read the file and display the bitmap. I had aspirations to make the program smart and verify the header and select the right graphics mode, but I got lazy and assumed that the file was good, and changed a few lines for each rez.  I also saved images in 4 gray (PGM format), and 4 colors (PNM format) expect to see those here too soon.  There should be a 80 x 48 image too, but I screwed up the conversion (got 64 x 48) and as it takes a fair amount of monkey work to get from linux to Atari, it may come later."

However, in this case, you can also turn down the 'color' control on the TV if it has one in a menu somewhere. could be called 'saturation'. This makes everything black and white, but you'd lose the artifacting. you should look up 'rastaconverter' if you have an SIO2xxx solution. It runs on linux, though you might have to play around with the source a bit to make it compile. There's also another image conversion program, easier to use than rastaconverter, and more consistent results, but it uses a flickermode and has lower resolution. I don't remember what that one is called."

My intention is to (fairly) quickly show what can be done, and what the Atari's capabilities are 160 x 192 vs. 160 x 96 doesn't add much to the exercise.  Similar about the artifacting. I couldn't find the remote for the TV to get it into menu mode. I'm not even sure that it would help. If a small dot that's supposed to be white is hitting a red stripe, cranking down the intensity shouldn't do anything. Yes I could hook it to a more modern TV than the vintage 13"" Trinitron, but that's part of the fun.  I should probably buy a SIO2PC solution, but I'm still just running  Critical Connection (CP/M to Atari). So my monkey motion is this -- work on the image in linux, copy to a DOS floppy, boot up my Win2K machine in DOS 5, run 22DSK (won't work in Windows because Windows wants a magic number on a disk to identify the format) to copy to a CP/M floppy, which I then carry downstairs to the Morrow which is connected to the 800.

retrobattlestations,3a4p19,floodrouting,2,Wed Jun 17 05:13:02 2015 UTC,"If anyone is interested in the details of how I did this, it goes something like this:  I took a picture with my phone and then ran it through Convert9918.  This produced 2 files: picture.tiac and picture.tiap.  These contain the Color and Pattern information respectively.  These filenames are fine on the PC but the TI doesn't have periods in filenames (periods are used like path separators) so I renamed these to pic_c and pic_p.  This is the filename format that TI Artist expects.  Then I used Ti99Dir to put these files into a .dsk image.  I used dsk2cf to write this disk image to a volume on my nanoPEB Compact Flash card.  I wrote a disk image of TI Artist to a different volume on the CF card.  I put the CF card back into the nanoPEB and booted the TI.  I mounted the volume containing TI Artist as DSK1 and the volume containing the picture as DSK2.  I had TI Artist in volume 173 and the pictures in volume 174 so from TI BASIC I ran:  CALL MOUNT(1, 173) CALL MOUNT(2, 174)   Then I rebooted with the Editor/Assembler cartridge and used option 5 to run DSK1.CONPT1 which is a viewing program that comes with TI Artist.  From here I could load DSK2.PIC and view it.  Then I took a picture of that with my phone and repeated everything one more time.  This was an interesting experience since I'd never used Convert9918 or TI Artist before.  Getting everything to work together took a bit of experimenting."

The G4 is late 90s which is generally considered obsolete and the power book is early 90s and therefore close to 25 years old. In 'computer time' they're ancient and in the real world they're pretty old. Not sure what the definition of retro is here.

retrobattlestations,3a0hxu,jzatarski,12,Tue Jun 16 07:11:07 2015 UTC,"Explanation: The VT420 supports redefining up to 96 characters of a character set. If you take each character, divide it into 6 subpixels (2x3), then the number of unique possibilities for each character is 26 or 64. Thus, I redefine 64 characters to each of these possibilities. Then I start with an image, use gimp to convert to grayscale and scale the size. Next, I adjust brightness and contrast in order to show the areas of interest better, in this case, the VT420 itself. As a last processing step, I convert the image to a 1 bit pallette, black and white. I export this image as a RAW image from gimp, producing an image with 1 pixel per byte, each byte 0 or 1 for white and black respectively. Then I put this raw image through a quick and dirty C program I wrote which converts the image into the redefined characters I made for the VT420, and sends it to STDOUT. when I invoke the program, I pipe STDOUT to /dev/ttyS0 where the VT420 is connected, and the image scrolls up line by line :)  What really amazes me is what you can do with so little resolution. I took a picture of a picture, of a picture, of a picture of a VT420, all displayed on that same device. despite these 4 layers, you can still see the first picture I took of the VT420 before it had any picture displayed on it, and the screen is still black."

I imagine that if the former is true, there is probably a generic rom out there somewhere that would suffice.    Given that wiki states that it was intended/expected? to use MP/M, I would imagine that the rom itself wouldn't be much more than a bootloader given that CP/M has a bios of sorts in software?

I bet most young kids nowadays will never know just how crappy passive matrix displays on laptops were. I endured them on a few very expensive laptops in the early 1990s. Let me tell you... imagine if when you drew a vertical or horizontal line on the screen, like a part of a window border, and it just kept going past where you wanted it to stop? There were faint horizontal and vertical ghosts of everything else on the screen, and the result looked like a ghastly patchwork of crap. The experience was  uniformly terrible. As soon as we could upgrade to active matrix TFT types the old laptops were discarded in disgust and without ceremony. I think it unlikely that anybody kept working examples of these around anywhere.   I still remember my first active matrix laptop, the Compaq LTE 3/25E, also with a monochrome display comparable to the PowerBook you have there."

Shows like Inside Edition and ET might feed an hour or two before stations start airing it, and the Seinfeld reruns might come twice a day, 3x a week.  Either way, the engineer records the show and there's just color bars or whatever where the local commercials go, when the show airs the engineer rolls the local commercials in that hole.  The Commodore program was written in BASIC by one of the old school Radio Shack kinda guys back in the day, he turned into a crazy old dude though.  Nowadays, all this is done by computer.  I'm sure digital delivery is a big part of it now, and a timed playlist rolls the commercials off a server.  It's good and bad, the machine doesn't have the precision of a human to wait that extra half of a second for the fade, the computer automatically gets the commercial timings.  Nobody actually watches the show before it airs, and it looks sloppy.  But the cost savings of not paying people to catch these errors is greater than the errors themselves, apparently."

retrobattlestations,39l3n8,CthulhuClaws,4,Sat Jun 13 10:02:44 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong about protecting the electromagnetic spectrum. There are only so many MHz of bandwidth available for any reasonable means for radio communication and once you've allocated all of that, there's no more to mine or produce or gain otherwise.  100kHz to about 30MHz is the range of frequencies that can be used for (low bandwidth) planetwide communication without resorting to satellites, relays or longhaul cable.  30MHz to about 300MHz is the only frequency range with medium bandwidth capacity and suitable for midrange undirected communication as well for satellite communication.  300MHz to about 5GHz is the range of frequencies in which you can do high bandwidth transmissions with only small technical communications. However for longer range communications you need directional links.  And above 5GHz it's either short range or quite specialized and/or expensive equipment to get anything going. The K band is kind of an outlier due to satellite TV, which made K band receivers quite cheap. But transmitting in the K band is still not a simple deal.  So yes, there's a very good reason why the FCC (and by extension all the national regulative bodies) have a very sharp and keen eye on the EM spectrum and keeping it tidy."

Wall voltage in Germany is 220-240 volts, so you're going to need a step-down transformer to run everything.

Replacing isn't an option (Though, buying a new one to toy with won't be a bad idea. I had no idea the scene here was big). I have the monitors for everything, and also have NTSC<-> Pal converters, so not worried about using TVs here.  Also, I have adapters for everything here in Slovakia. I already brought my laptops, game consoles, etc with me (Lots of bags at the airport :P). The hard parts to send over are the monitors. The C64 and it's box is only like $40, which isn't much to me. Most of my boxes are around that size (and the older laptops are small for the most part).  Mostly want to avoid $800 for shipping packages that are bigger than the max size. I thought about getting a shipping container, but I have no idea where to even look at that. I did USPS check of the max size + the weight of the monitor, and it was only like $200, which I could handle, but sadly the box is a little too big.

Securing a basic PCI card to try, if you haven't already is worth a go. Unfortunately I don't of any neat, tidy way to figure out the difference between malfunctioning cards and broken slots.    If you have the right cable and another computer with a serial port, you can try finding a linux distro that will boot to a serial terminal without you telling it to. If you can get such a one onto a bootable cd, then with the other computer that has a hardware serial port (usually DB-9), some terminal emulator software, and a null modem cable? (I think) you can do some things. Basically what you've got is a terminal displayed as text over the serial port instead of on the graphics output. At that point if it boots the distro you can use command line tools to see if linux detects the graphics card and possibly if it sees the slot at all."

The only way to program for this thing is to cross compile.  Edit: Actually, looking it up makes me realise that it is a different machine.   Everyone knows how cool the Tandy Model 100 family is. But what if you're a hard-core writer. You don't need BASIC or alot of other program, you just need a solid word processor with a great keyboard. Then you probably need a WP-2. It has the same great keyboard as a Model 100. But it has some additional benefits as well. The screen is 80 characters wide. It's not back-lit, but it is so reflective that you might be fooled. It's also quite a bit thinner than a Model 100 (easily less than an inch), and much lighter. It has standard parallel and serial ports on the back. It can also take a memory card for additional storage. And it can use Model 100 perephrials, like the portable disk drives."

retrobattlestations,392v4o,crackacola,12,Mon Jun 8 21:59:17 2015 UTC,"Those drawings were commissioned for the Atari execs, by no other than Alan Kay and Bob Stein.  Atari didn't predict anything, it was Alan and Bob the ones that were trying to present difficult concepts, based on research by a lot of people, to a bunch of execs.  His words:     Hi Bob (and visitors) People reading this should realize that there was nothing new to be thought up to make these scenarios (they were for Warner execs who were not sophisticated about computers despite having bought Atari). The ideas were all drawn (pretty much without exception) from the visions and demonstrations of the ARPA-IPTO research community in the 1960s, ca 1968. Main sources were Licklider, Taylor, Doug Engelbart, Nicholas Negroponte, Ivan Sutherland, Seymour Papert, some of my ideas back then (such as the wireless tablet computer), and many others from our colleagues. I’m not sure what Bob means by “missing that it was going to connect people to other people”. This was one of the main reasons for all the work we did at ARPA and at Xerox PARC on networking, including ARPAnet and Internet, and both wired and wireless. This was the subject of a very good white paper from 1968 by the founder of IPTO and one of his successors (JCR Licklider and Bob Taylor) “The computer as a Communication Device” (the second paper in this pdf: http://memex.org/licklider.pdf). It was one of the concerns of Bob Barton, the great computer designer when I was in grad school in the 60s. It was the subject of a whole day discussion at the first ARPA grad student conference in 1968 as we were in the process of building the ARPAnet. It was the main concern of Engelbart, who showed in “the mother of all demos” in 1968 many ways to do communication in many modes of time including real-time and face to face. And many kinds of such communication was happening in the ARPA and PARC communities in the 70s. The problem was the 1980s and what was lost by the gold-rush to commercialize subsets of these ideas (to an extent that in many cases was like the carpetbaggers). It was certainly missed in the 80s by IBM and even Apple. But not at Atari — this was just an implicit part of the “ARPA Dream”. McLuhan warned us (using books and TV) indirectly about how strongly people were going to try to regain some sense of identity via an electronic global village. The hope by all of us from the 60s was that education — and The Encyclopedia Britannica whom Bob and I tried to get to understand at length what was going to happen — would help to create a sense of the real value here. But this didn’t happen, and we wound up with a pop culture. We can see this so easily by looking at comments on these pictures on various blog sites. I could only find one person who was unlazy enough to see if there were other opinions about these ideas (and did they really come from 1982 or earlier). That’s a pop culture, mostly trying to admire itself in every shiny surface it can find, and leaving behind the equivalent of “I was here” graffiti. Best wishes, Alan     And here is the link."

The one thing I didn't really see in those drawings was the idea that they were all interconnected. They could have just as easily been cartridge systems with no external connection or been receiving information via broadcast but not pushing back. Then again, computer networking was pretty old by that point, regardless of what DOS might have lead people to believe, so it wouldn't have been a great leap. Perhaps the source of the drawings would have more detail."

If you look at Bob Stern's article on these images, you see that there is no concept of communications between users in the original drawings.  Everyone is accessing a central information source called the Intelligent Encyclopedia, and apart from the guys in the bar ""running a simulation"" the access is mostly passive.    Don't get me wrong, the idea that this could be a decade away was still pretty far fetched stuff for the average person in 1982.  But OP is trying to reinterpret the images in the way we use mobile data today, and losing sight of how people thought about computers and communications in the early 80s."

They're really well built cases, they come apart into pieces without much effort, lots of mounting holes and such. Mine's not quite as cool as your system, with all the boards are manufactured, but I'll have to show it once I get the power supply working.   I'm also not quite sure if yours is entirely from the 70's. It's hard to tell from the photos but one of the chips on the disk controller board appears to have a 82 date code on it, and one on the board behind that appears to say 8423, so 23rd week of 1984. If you want to check the chips are the one right above the ""Inc."" on the disk controller board, it's the number in the top right corner of the chip that ends in an A, it's YYWW, and the other is the chip on the board behind it with the SSS logo, it's the short number on the bottom of the chip."

In those days you got a kit with a PCB and components which you soldered in yourself. Or you could create your own with off the shelf components and etch your own PCB, I don't think a lot of people did that, though.  Obviously these days computers are too complex to build yourself.

The coolest part about video gaming back then was that a new game could come out and literally invent a new genre (or subgenre) of gaming. On an NES you were extremely limited to a few types of games, whereas on PC you had text adventures, western style RPGs (as well as JRPGs and knockoffs), shareware, freeware, BBSes, MUDs, Gopher/Kermit and Usenet (console gamers had to pay $4.99 or whatever to talk to the 1-800 hint number), BASIC and C compilers to make your own games, adult games or things that Nintendo et al. would never approve. Then, later, when people were still playing platformers on SNES and Genesis, I had games on CD-ROM, mouse support, MIDI synthesizers like the MT-32 or Roland Sound Canvas (which sounded absolutely amazing), steering wheel support, joysticks with super complicated flight sims (Falcon 3.0 came with a manual as thick as a game console), map editors for Doom, mods and WADs, and so on.  I think this covers the timespan from the late 80s to the mid 90s, and my experience was limited to IBM PC clones at the time. Most of these things were also possible even earlier, on the Commodore 64, TRS-80, and similar...and if you were lucky enough to have an Amiga during the late 80s or early 90s, you'd laugh and look down on PC gamers as much as they laughed at console gamers!"

This was my 5th grade (IIRC) science fair project - I pitted a Mac Plus against an IBM 5150 in a series of chess matches, with me as the human ""interface"" between them. I'd set each machine to play against ""me,"" (one white, one black), and then manually enter one's move into the other as ""my"" move.   Unsurprisingly, the Mac wiped the floor with the PC - the details have been lost to time, but I vaguely remember the IBM winning a couple games out of two or three dozen, and the Mac (with its faster Motorola 68000 CPU) was able to come up with its moves in far less time.  I think I had a version of ChessMaster on the Mac, and probably SARGON on the PC - I remember devoting an entire panel on my backing board to discussing the limitations of my experiment, since I wasn't able to get my hands on the same chess program for both machines (and given that they were spec'ed out differently - pretty sure the IBM had 1 meg of RAM on an ISA board, while the Mac had 4 megs of 30-pin SIMM sticks).

If you recall, old Apple computers were a dime a dozen before Steve Jobs made a bunch of shiny stuff that people lined up to buy.   I don't recall the Apple I prices before this, and I'm sure they were still pricey, relatively speaking. However, I've seen too many eBay posts with old Apple computers that are titled: ""RARE VINTAGE GENUINE APPLE II A+++ VERY RARE COLLECTOR'S ITEM"" and start at $400.   People were giving old Macs away just a few years ago. There are also so many other awesome, old computers that are treated like trash today, even though they're no less interesting or impressive than the Apple I."

retrobattlestations,37wrch,yarash,2,Sun May 31 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"Id say try goodwill or freecycle, or at minimum find the case locally and get the rest of the parts on eBay. The case is where you're going to get killed on shipping. Parts for a 486 or Pentium 3 have to be cheap on eBay.   I highly recommend learning to put everything together, its a little more complicated with some of the older systems, but the basic principles are the same as modern ones. Just much less forgiving."
retrobattlestations,37wrch,dexter311,2,Sun May 31 03:37:39 2015 UTC,"A P3 machine is cheap as chips to build yourself (486 parts in my experience are more expensive though). You should be able to get a mobo, CPU and RAM in a bundle on eBay for $10-15 of you aren't picky about specific parts (either Slot 1 or Socket 370 would work). Make sure it has an AGP slot and USB ports - almost all mobos of that era have 2x USB 1.1 ports, so you can use your current keyboard/mouse. You could scrounge up an IDE hard drive and optical drive for nothing if you ask around, otherwise that'd probably another $10 max on eBay, then another $10 for a 200 or 300W 20pin power supply. Then chuck those into any old ATX case - it'll fit in anything as long as it isn't proprietary.  All that's left is a graphics card and a sound card, and depending on what you want to play determines how much you might need to shell out. Everyone wants 3dfx gear in their P3 gaming rigs, but you could go cheaper with a TNT2 or even something later like a Geforce MX or FX. If you want genuine Glide, the Voodoo3 3000 is probably your best bang for buck. Similarly, everyone wants a sweet SoundBlaster AWE64 Gold, but really you can get great results with a SoundBlaster Live! Value card which can be had for a few dollars. Although, I would recommend using an ISA card if you want to run DOS games - it's just less headache than PCI.  I've built three or four retro rigs over three past year including two P3 gaming rigs, so feel free to ask about anything else."

I can tell you from experience that the heatsink size can really decrease substantially. I upgraded one of my computers to a 600mhz slot 1 and the heatsink size on the new one was a quarter the depth of the old one.    Also, apparently some PII boards support PIII slot 1 cpus so you may have some flex in which board you choose. I imagine there are of boards with the slot style out there on the market (if they weren't recycled), because the ones with the drop in cpus are more upgradeable in the cpu department.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Pentium_III_microprocessors#Desktop_processors http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Pentium-III/index.html  The computers are I have from that era are Intel 440bx (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_440BX) based boards and are all Dell computers.

The C-64 I had in the 80s had a fairly large all tube color TV, late 1960s vintage, and worked very well. As did the mono composite monitor I connected to the Luma out."

Why were PC color monitors still so expensive at the time? My parents bought a monochrome PC XT clone in 1987 (The C64 came out in 1982) and none of my friends had a PC with a color monitor until at least a couple years later. Going to the mall to play games on a color monitor was a thing.
retrobattlestations,37q6ti,ido,1 point,Sat May 30 09:02:35 2015 UTC,"Because color CRTs were inherently more expensive, especially higher resolutions, and the drive/convergence a bit more complex.

retrobattlestations,37q6ti,classicsat,1 point,Sat May 30 13:42:43 2015 UTC,So the c64 could use lower res/quality CRTs (like those on TVs) while PCs needed higher res ones?

It will supply a sharper image if you use the Y/C connections on a Y/C capable monitor, or just Y on a mono monitor (which is what I did, for the C-64 and PC with a CGA card with that output). I would have modified my old TV to have Y/C in, if I knew how then.   PCs, at EGA or better, used finer dot pitch and faster scan rates. CGA was the same as TV, and many CGA cards had composite out."
retrobattlestations,37q6ti,classicsat,1 point,Sat May 30 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"Color monitors were harder to make than TVs as they had higher resolution. In 1989 I bought my first mac and my 21 inch trinitron was $2500 and the video card to power it was $2300. My RAM was $1000 for just 32Mb. Total price for my Quadra 840AV was $8000. Everything electronic was more expensive. That $8000 back then was like $16,000 in today's dollars! It took me 4 years to pay off the loan I borrowed from my parents. This is why I have no sympathy when people complain that a new iMac is so much money when it is just $2000."

Two reasons for this:  -I own a Fluke 8010A multimeter. It was manufactured in 1979 and still has the factory installed NiCDs inside. They work flawlessly - they'll still run the meter for about 20 hours on a charge.  -I opened a package of the same RadioShack C cell NiCDs, dated 1988, last year. Not only do they hold a flawless charge, but they still had the natural float voltage of a NiCD (1.2v) across them immediately after taking them out of the package! They were dead (NiCDs don't really drop in voltage across the cell when they're discharged, but their internal resistance goes way up when they're nearly dead), but hold a perfect charge.

If I remember correctly, one could take the levers and these metal parts apart, so I suppose you could clean the metal if necessary. Any wire works to make connections, of course, so if the holes have shrunken, find a thinner wire somewhere. Or carefully widen the holes again.  If you can't get new light bulbs, I suppose you could replace them with some LEDs with suitable voltage. Take the broken light bulbs apart and solder some wires (or directly the LEDs) to the socket, then you don't have to modify the original ""computer"".  There's a neat trick they used in this ""computer"": You can put some text on the ""outputs"" that tells the user to move a switch; so basically you have relays (operated by the user). So you can implement quite a bit of different logic circuits."

There then came some hour, minute, and second, now lost in time, in which literally the last punchcard machine was turned off, and never turned back on. At that second the world moved on. Did anyone wonder about it? This one, definitive moment, separated two worlds: one in which the machines were actual business tools, and the other, modern world, in which they are only ever used for novelty or nostalgia's sake.

The first couple were record stores. They had one central 286 running Sco Xenix, and had a few multiport serial cards. Most of the ports were attached to Wyse-50 terminals (similar to the BT510). The terminals also had a cash drawer, receipt printer, and barcode reader. Cashiers would log in, and the cash register program would start automatically.   (Side-note: this particular software didn't let you get into a unix shell, but one search function used 'more' which allowed you to escape to a shell. That was my first exposure to exploring unix.)  Another job I worked for was a book distributor. They had an AIX system with a concentrator wired to about two dozen Wyse terminals around the building. Also wired to the system were several printers. The cabling was a pain in the ass since it all had to terminate in one location. But it worked.   What's interesting is that prior to the widespread use of tcp/ip, Ethernet, web browsers, etc, many systems were like this. Unix was beautiful and had many built-in facilities for all kinds of terminal-based operations, many of which were unknown to the companies that used them (such as the 'wall' command which would send a message to all terminals, terminal based modem programs, local email, and if you were lucky terminal based games, etc).   Serial based ""networking"" was a pain sometimes. Cross-over cables, break-out boxes, hand made cables and adapters, speed, parity, stop-bit settings.. And there was a Sun server we had at one job where if you disconnected the main console terminal, the system would reboot. Good times.  Go now and get one (or a bunch!) of these serial terminals and wire them to a Linux box."

It looks like it was made in 1990, so probably not a full year after introduction of 486 and whole two years before VLB.  Indeed that's an awesome find. There is a storeroom I sometimes visit with three or four cardboard boxes packed with PCBs (some computers, mostly not) stacked onto each other. That's where I found this motherboard and some other boards I now have at home. Nobody needs that stuff and it would be sold to recyclers after a while...  I was quite sure it would be broken after being stored this way, but it wasn't. I guess now I'll have to fill in these slots, build a nice case they deserve and figure something cool to do with it."

They both had os/2 on them with original media. I kept one with os/2 and one I put dos 6.22 and windows 3.11 on. We had a packard bell 486 as the family pc. The only neat thing about that sack of crap was the recovery cd that  came with it. It would let you make the recovery media from cd to floppy for windows and dos. I used this for many machines like the ps/2's as the installs required no serial numbers. The only suck was a lack of easily available mca sound card. Brings back memories. Hope to see more !"

It's significant for being quite probably the first networked multiplayer arena shooter-style game. It may also be the first networked multiplayer action game (although Maze War is another possibility for this distinction).

I have a laptop of similar vintage and specification that's IDE and some years ago I refurbished some Compaq LTE 386 systems that were also.   I've not really seen or heard of a laptop using a proprietary hard drive. In the ""hard card"" or ""matched drive and controller"" era, portables didn't have hard drives (they were too fragile) and those portables weren't ""laptops"" anyway. Some early models used desktop-style 3.5"" IDE drives and Apples and other non-x86 systems often used SCSI, but nearly everything else used 2.5"" IDE until SATA came along."

Pretty much the only way you're going to connect two old computers together over the internet is by having a ""computer"" or two involved. It could be a simple RS232 to TCP converter, a Raspberry Pi, or a desktop. No matter what, you need something to convert the serial that the Atari speaks to TCP/IP.

Almost every single thing on this laptop works - even the main battery, which, as far as I can tell, is the original NiMH battery. It charges (although it'll take about an hour to actually start charging when it's totally flat), and I once got it to last for 55 minutes whilst playing Transport Tycoon Deluxe - usually it lasts for more like 20 minutes though. Only things wrong with it are the obligatory dead CMOS and sleep batteries, and a couple of stuck pixels in the TFT screen (oh, and I'm not sure the fan works, but it's never been a problem).

On my gap year before uni I worked in a little computer repair/recondition shop and one of our signs in the window said ""We sell a laptop for £50!""  That would be a Toshiba Satellite just like this one.  The sign worked great. People would come in wanting to see the ""£50 laptop"". They couldn't believe a laptop could possibly be sold for just £50 in...I guess this would have been 2002/2003.  So I'd show them one of these, show them what it could do, and more importantly tell them what it couldn't do, and so on.  We'd often sell the ""£50 laptop"" to someone who just wanted a cheap and cheerful computer to type their thesis, or in many cases someone whose kids had been bugging them for a computer ""any computer"" just to have their very own to play about with, rather than having to timeshare the family one.  But, most of all, it brought people into the shop who didn't know anything about computers but liked the idea of leaving with a laptop for £50. I'd be able to use the £50 laptop as a perfect example to explain what a computer could do for them, and they'd often then decide they in fact wanted one of our £200 ones.  Because it was such a successful strategy, whenever we sold our last £50 model, we'd have to lower the price of the next laptop up because we really didn't want to give up the sign."

It has an external drive bay and a cold-swappable internal drive bay, but under strict rules: The external bay only powered the 3.5 floppy module.  The CD-ROM drive could be stored in the external bay but used only in the internal one.  To transfer a file or program that wouldn't fit on a floppy, I discovered ""Direct Cable Connection"" and tethered a serial cable between it and the family desktop.  The dual PCMCIA slots came in handy when it came time to add a 56k modem and an Ethernet dongle.

The basic idea behind the Plus 4 was to make a lower cost 8 bit machine at a time when the C64 was the most popular machine in the world...but was on the verge of being eclipsed by 16 bit machines. Because the C64 costs were relatively high compared to what could be made with a less capable chipset (many of the features that made the C64 so good for games were removed from the Plus 4, like sprites and good sound, though it got a few extras like a better BASIC and a higher color palette), they wanted to make an even cheaper machine.  Somehow, Commodore were fixated on being cheap, when they were already cheap enough with the C64. The benefits of the C64 (pervasiveness, huge software library, strong for games, etc.) just weren't apparent to management, so they did a lot of stupid things. Plus 4 was one of those stupid things.  I bought one used a year or two after they'd been discontinued, and played with the BASIC quite a bit. It was definitely superior to the C64 (or even 128) BASIC versions, requiring far fewer PEEK and POKE commands to do cool stuff. The in-ROM productivity apps were stupid and pointless, though."

I'd been upgrading and struggling along using the Amiga for browsing the nascent web, etc. I think I had my 3000 for about five years, which is like three lifetimes in computers.

As OP noted all the Plus/4 inventory ended up being sold at bargain basement prices because nobody wanted them. It was a huge flop for Commodore and a huge waste of money at a time when Commodore could not afford to be throwing away money.  I don't really think the C65 was the answer, though I kinda lust over it today as a nostalgic thing...I think throwing everything behind the Amiga would have been the right answer. As it was, Amiga came into being in a world where Commodore didn't have a massive war chest because they'd blown it on stupid shit like the Plus/4. And Commodore, despite having the best selling computer in the world to bankroll their next generation, opted to spend it on less capable machines with higher margins.  So, I don't know how things might have played out had Commodore not be so sadly mismanaged, but I know the Plus/4 was a costly mistake, and led to a lot of disappointed people who thought a Plus/4 was an upgrade from the Commodore 64."

SID emulation is interesting (mostly, to me, because you can get serious polyphony for drones or chords) and the emulation accuracy (waveforms & filter) has come a long way."

They weren't cheap (compared to, say, Yamaha YM2612 synth chips which are similarly capable and similarly nostalgic for many people), but I have a soft spot for the SID, and a tendency to go overboard in my plans. I think even when buying so many, the price per chip was something like $20/each, but it was NOS and all the same version and revision of the chip, so they're expected to be fully functional and would go well together in a multi-SID synth design (i.e. some channels won't sound different than other channels with the same program).  I also bought a couple of SID2SID printed circuit boards at the same time, so I could install dual SIDs in my C64s (I had two of them at the time), but never got around to building those either. I'm a procrastinator of considerable talent."

retrobattlestations,3666dv,SwellJoe,2,Sun May 17 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"OMG I'm looking at the tech manual for this board. It could emulate much much more than a c64. Hell it could emulate an Amiga (any model) and any MAC up to 350mhz processor, leaving the unused cycles for system specific timing oddities. Even better Apple II/C/GS, and 286/386/486 systems. THIS is really the one stop FPGA hardware emulation solution.  $320 for the board is reasonable considering it's specs. Damn you /u/SwellJoe.

This newer FPGA is faster by quite a bit. I haven't even thought about Apple IIgs emulation, but that's something I would also enjoy having to play with (the onboard synth was totes cool, and it was sort of the Apple equivalent of the C65, but it actually made it into production). Do you know if there's an image already out there for this board for other systems? My knowledge of FPGAs is very limited...I don't know if it's possible to use the same ""bitstream"" on multiple related boards, or if it is very specific.  Anyway, if this particular FPGA already has an Amiga 1200/4000ish emulator implementation in addition to the C65/C64, that'd likely be enough for me to consider it a must have. Though, I kinda want to wait for the Mega65, since I want the SID slots already on-board. And, if they get to the point where they're able to do a production run of that case...well, that would be amazing. I'm almost as excited by the case as I am by what it will contain."

The market was moving away from ""boots to a BASIC interpreter"" by the time they were working on it.  I think one interesting, neglected point was that there was a lot of user data stuck on 1541 discs and 64 software.  There was no way out of that ecosystem to a 16 or 32-bit system.  If you're gonna lose all your data and software, may as well buy a PC/ST/Mac instead of an Amiga.  Apple handled this much better; they made an IIe on a card you could stuff into a bunch of low-end Macs.  I wonder if a ""64 card"" for the Amiga, even as a $200 upsell, would have been a winner."

There was a 128 version of GEOS, which I never used, but that would have been a really good excuse to have a 128 instead of a 64.  I always wished for more software to be 128 native; I mean, double the RAM, a double speed CPU, and an 80 column display are huge features. In fact, I still wish for more software to be 128 native. I currently don't have a 128 (I have a 64C that I picked up a few years ago), but I would find a 128 if I could expect to be able to use it with MSSIAH in 80 column mode (and I would happily buy another MSSIAH cartridge to get a 128 version)."

Also, apparently the Z80 used in the prototype 128 came from a doorstop. Commodore had previously run a promotion where people could turn in a Sinclair to get a $100 discount (more than the price of a new Sinclair), and they ended up with so many of the machines that some employees started using them as doorstops in their offices."

I had a 1571, and I remember one danger was that some of my disks were double sided, while others were ""flippy"" (formatted as two single sided disks back to back, as was common on the 1541). Once or twice I accidentally formatted one side of a flippy as double-sided, erasing the other side."

The 1581 had two major modes: native where 1581 ran at full speed, especially hooked into a C128 with burst mode enabled.  But when used with the C64, the computer's internal ROM chipset limited the R/W speed of the drive.  So essentially it was running  in 1541 mode, just at the speed. It was using the full 800K native 750K formatted."

It was basically put into a box with no protective packaging, and all the items in the set left loose in the box. As you can imagine, it turned up basically in a million pieces. Needless to say a claim was filed immediately and all the money got back.   Seriously - who is that stupid? Even if you auction didn't fetch the kind of money you wanted, and you did it out of spite, it's cost you even MORE money to be a jackass."

I got 2 different bowls that were smashed in shipping before finally getting an intact one from somebody who knew how to pack glassware.  And as for the money, yes, this machine sold a bit below market value but I'm assuming the seller got it on the cheap at a yard sale or something, and had he said ""Hey, I'm coming up short on shipping here, can you spot me an extra $5"" I'd have happily done it.

That went in a giant Pelican case surrounded by foam, and prior to being packed, I stuffed foam blocks around the CRT, removed expansion cards and hand-carried those so they couldn't go vibrating around, and put foam and tape in the card cage to keep those in place.  Unfortunately I don't think I have any pictures of this, but the Lisa made it all the way to Helsinki and back intact."

A device like this represents more than just its capabilities.  It's like saying an apollo guidance computer could be built using a raspberry pi.  Big deal.

retrobattlestations,35jdxg,SutbleMisspellnig,0,Mon May 11 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure really what distinction you're making there.

Accomplishing the game with lights described above would require just quite a bit of work on a Pi as well.  I'm also not sure exactly what ""20 year old problem"" you refer to and how the age of the problem is relevant."
retrobattlestations,35jdxg,Wheagy,2,Wed May 13 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it would indeed be a challenge and a learning experience to implement this heathkit trainer with a raspberry pi, but it would be an entirely different experience than using the trainer itself.  With the pi, you are learning about the pi; with the trainer, you are learning about that particular microprocessor(whatever it is) and the supporting chips.  Not saying one is better than the other, but to say that they are the same isn't really accurate.  I think would be a really cool project to implement a CPU such as the one on that trainer with a raspberry pi, and to have it pin compatible.  That way you could drop it in place of the CPU and have the rest of the board function as it was, but then you would basically be using an in-circuit emulator for the CPU.  That would be awesome.  The deal with the 20 year old problem isn't about the age of the problem itself.  The issue is that solving a 20 year old problem with today's technology is trivial.  You don't really learn anything about what went in to solving it in the first place.  You miss out on the progression of technology that lead us to where we are today.  I just think that an understanding and appreciation of that progression is helpful in moving forward and solving today's problems.  If we only look at what we have today, it's harder to see what we could have in the future."
retrobattlestations,35jdxg,yorgle,1 point,Wed May 13 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"If you write in ARM assembly then you are effectively learning about the Pi's CPU. What you are doing is different perhaps, but the two units are essentially the same/similar, as I said, in the sense that they are single board computers. If you hook analog circuitry up to your GPIO pins you will have to learn how that circuitry works to be able to operate it properly yourself.  Implementing a CPU on a raspberry Pi is just as wasteful of resources and computing powerful as dedicating a modern PC to just being an system emulator. It's cool and impressive, but rather pointless. Especially when the cpu that you are emulating is technically still available in some form.  You haven't addressed what the ""20 year old problem"" IS, which is part of what I was asking. Some of the stuff you are talking about can be learned by writing x86 assembly and running it inside of dosbox."

The Z3 as a universal Turing machine of article  Z3 %28computer%29:       It was possible to construct loops on the Z3, but there was no conditional branch instruction. Nevertheless, the Z3 was Turing-complete – how to implement a universal Turing machine on the Z3 was shown in 1998 by Raúl Rojas.   He proposes that the tape program would have to be long enough to execute every possible path through both sides of every branch. It would compute all possible answers, but the unneeded results would be canceled out (a kind of speculative execution). Rojas concludes, ""We can therefore say that, from an abstract theoretical perspective, the computing model of the Z3 is equivalent to the computing model of today's computers. From a practical perspective, and in the way the Z3 was really programmed, it was not equivalent to modern computers.""     Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

After the hard drive died, he migrated to a Wang Laboratories system, using the same Wyse 50s.  Then the IBM PC revolution came, and he went away from centrally managed systems until about 15 years ago when I installed his first server (Windows NT4).    Funny how things come around again, eh?"

Along with those were Altos's branded terminals, which were mostly VT100/220 clones but one of which was essentially a rebadged Wyse 50 in a different shell, and called the Altos IV.  I can't blame people for buying those, though, because they were a lot cheaper than the VT-based terminals and from a user's point of view not noticeably different."

retrobattlestations,34v69l,balkenbrij,2,Tue May 5 20:35:12 2015 UTC,"hmm, doesn't linux do uppercase->lowercase automagically when you login with a username in uppercase? Bsd's login does that and treats uppercase as lowercase for everything after that.  edit: ah, found it in the man page; use the -U option of agetty for uppercase terminal only handling.     -U, --detect-case           Turn on support for detecting an uppercase-only terminal.   This           setting  will  detect  a  login name containing only capitals as           indicating an uppercase-only terminal and turn on some upper-to-           lower  case  conversions.  Note that this has no support for any           Unicode characters."
retrobattlestations,34v69l,balkenbrij,2,Tue May 5 10:15:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, you have to tell agetty to do so, and interestingly it doesn't affect commands passed to the shell; I had to use stty for that, though I haven't been able to find out how to make that stick.  I think it has to do with the fact that the port's state keeps changing thus resetting.    I have an OpenBSD box, but it's my server in the garage, far away from my desk with the VIC.  Perhaps I'll pull out my Sun Sparcstation IPX, and use the VIC as the serial console...  Last night I actually had the idea of building an ""interpreter"" of sorts in Python; something that will take the PETSCII codes and translate them into ASCII codes.  I could even go farther, and translate the ""normal"" PETSCII alphanumeric codes to lowercase, then translate shift+key codes to uppercase, just like a normal keyboard.  Tempting..."
retrobattlestations,34v69l,balkenbrij,2,Tue May 5 14:02:47 2015 UTC,"hmm weird, i don't remember having to use stty on bsd systems. Doesn't the stty work when you use it in your login profile? You can make it optional by looking at the output of 'tty'. Maybe good old csh is also a good choice for uppercase only terminals btw, it has decent history support without needing special keys. It does file name completion with escape, maybe that will be a problem though.  I run openbsd on sparc also, i'd try to see if that works out better.  Instead of doing the interpreter in python you can also do it in your basic program. But, if the characters display correctly on the terminal i don't think it matters, the character codes are the same for 7bit ascii i think (e.g. 'A' == 65). Switching to lowercase won't work i think, the codes are still for the uppercase characters, only the display of them is changed to lowercase on the vic (at least, that's how it is on the c64).  Maybe there are some old terminal programs for it also? It was fairly common back in the days to connect with these kind of systems to larger servers.  e: i found http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/vic20/utilities/8k/ mightyterm, it has vt100 emulation also. There's also plus term. I never used any of them btw and your basic program is very neat so.."
retrobattlestations,34v69l,balkenbrij,2,Wed May 6 07:44:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are a world of possibilities.  I'm having to use stty here because, in this instance, it's hooked up to my Linux laptop (side note: how's this for meta -- I run my VIC-20 through a USB capture card and display it in mplayer on my Linux laptop, then I have a serial connection from the VIC-20 back to the Linux laptop to get a console...)  I've seen that mightyterm, and I really want to try it, but I don't have a good, reliable way to transfer ROMs to my VIC at the moment.  I can use the RS232, but it's error-prone and you have to type in a 25-line program before loading a ROM.  Not terrible, but it gets tedious after a few failures.  That's actually also why I haven't expanded the BASIC program I wrote for the terminal, as I have to re-type it every time (no 1541 here :( ).  Thanks for thinking on this; it's fun to contemplate!"
retrobattlestations,34v69l,balkenbrij,2,Wed May 6 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"yes it's unfortunate that a cassetteplayer has a special connector i believe or you could use any regular cassetteplayer, maybe getting a commodore one is an option? They aren't as expensive and i think it's possible to copy things by playing wav files on your laptop and recording it via line-out onto a normal cassetteplayer with line-in.  I love things like this setup, i had a serial terminal next to my bed for years :)"
retrobattlestations,34v69l,3583Bytes,2,Wed May 6 14:07:16 2015 UTC,"There are a couple inexpensive options.  I'm currently looking at the XM1541 cable, which allows you to use your PC as a disk drive.  I have enough spare parts around here (aside from the 6-pin DIN connector) to build one already.  By far the best option is the SD2IEC, which lets you hook an SD card into the machine.  They're a bit on the spendy side, though (well, not really -- $50-75, but I'm a cheapskate).

retrobattlestations,345orc,charonpdx,1 point,Mon May 4 08:18:13 2015 UTC,"Only just got this machine late yesterday so I can't give an in-depth review yet, but the display has aged fairly well. Playing C64 games on a regular-sized CRT is good, but one of the perks of a smaller display is that the blocky text and sprites appear sharper and more defined, even while shrunk.   Also, Commodore wisely reversed the color-scheme for the BASIC environment on the SX-64, so you get blue text against a white background - much easier on the eyes when working on a 5-inch display. I gather this causes some compatibility issues with a few old programs, but probably not enough to worry about much.  If you can find an SX-64 in your area without breaking the bank, you could do a lot worse - it's super fun to play retro games on authentic vintage hardware (emulators are great too, but lack the old-school experience of whirring disks and clicky joysticks)."

Octanes are way cheaper  i got mine for 100 euros. that was a few years ago, but since the interest for them has died down i think they should be even cheaper these days. of course to get those prices you must buy from an enthusiast or from a company getting rid of its obsolete hardware, not from professional resellers on ebay.   My advice if you want to buy an SGI machine is, be patient and wait for one to be available locally. These things are HEAVY and they're a pain in the ass to move, so shipping them often isn't worth it because of cost and the skins are so fragile that they'll end up breaking during shipping anyway. So when people need to get rid of them, you can usually get a VERY good price if you're willing to pick it up yourself. My friend got a high spec, working, very good condition deskside onyx with mint skins for 200 euros because the guy was moving and my friend was the only one willing to pick it up in person.

Putting your CPU onto some perfboard and using kind of wire harness to connect it to the rest of that might be useful here. In such a case you'd probably want the clock and reset circuit to go with it. The same goes for any output devices you have (like LEDs); i.e. move them to a separate board.  Also, I'd strongly recommend some color coding via the wire (insulation) color.

Historically, ""Several manufacturers produced mainframe computers from the late 1950s through the 1970s.

History tends to be surprising.  I only found the Unix versions, and the 1974 HP basic version, if it actually existed, is still lost, so then the question is, was that particular HP machine a mainframe?

IBM and Cyrix made 486 chips with a 386 bus. The IBM Blue Lightning ran at 100Mhz with a 33 Mhz bus, but it only had a 16-bit bus, like a 386 SX, and no provisions for a floating point unit.

retrobattlestations,33mo3d,classicsat,2,Sat Apr 25 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'll take your word on that. Nevertheless I would like to point out that standardization was not always so entrenched as it is now. The VLB page on Wiki says that it was usually an extra edge connector socket that followed the ISA one and was a high speed I/O channel.  In the latter regard it could be VLB within reason. After all, there's no reason Zenith had to use brown connectors or even keyed ones if they chose not to. It isn't even necessary for them to have not used a full edge connector on the card and back-plane and simply re-purposed the extra pins while maintaining VLB compatibility. It's hard to plug the card in the wrong way when the little metal cover on the end is present. In addition the extra edge connector is present on the CPU and the VIDEO card.  If it's not VLB, then it is likely a similar sort of bus/connection that Zenith developed itself."
retrobattlestations,33mo3d,istarian,2,Sat Apr 25 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"interesting...  Check out this review of the 25MHz model.... it lists 32bit slots?

Think you misinterpreted the ""extra edge connector"" comment as it's immediately followed by   ""Ironically the VLB portion of a slot looked similar to an IBM MCA slot, as indeed it was the same physical 116-pin connector used by MCA cards, rotated by 180 degrees""  - specifying a connector.   The part you refer to seems to allude to the fact that it didn't matter what connector was up front as long as it had the additional connector at the back.  I'm also fairly sure VLB was a 486 thing, so maybe this was an immediate precursor?   Anyone know more about these 32bit ISA slots? Info seems a bit thin on the ground.... All I can find is that it may have been an effort not to pay royalties to use the EISA standard?"
retrobattlestations,33mo3d,classicsat,2,Mon Apr 27 07:37:01 2015 UTC,"Read the whole paragraph:  A ""VLB slot"" itself was simply an additional edge connector placed in-line with the traditional ISA or EISA connector, with this extended portion often colored a distinctive brown. The result was a normal ISA or EISA slot being additionally capable of accepting VLB-compatible cards. Traditional ISA cards remained compatible as they would not have pins past the normal ISA or EISA portion of the slot. The reverse was also true – VLB cards were by necessity quite long in order to reach the VLB connector, and were reminiscent of older full-length expansion cards from the earlier IBM XT era. Ironically the VLB portion of a slot looked similar to an IBM MCA slot, as indeed it was the same physical 116-pin connector used by MCA cards, rotated by 180 degrees. The IBM MCA standard had not been as popular as IBM expected and there was an ample surplus of the connector, making it inexpensive and readily available.[citation needed] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_Local_Bus#Historical_overview)  The rest of the text implies that the VLB connector came after the ISA/EISA slot, particular as it indicates that the addition of the connector did not break compatibility with regular ISA/EISA cards.    It does sounds like it was a 486 thing, so, of the alternatives, a Zenith specific slot that did similar things makes more sense. No idea about 32 bit ISA, I assume that's EISA. Not sure I've ever seen anything in person besides the 16 bit version of ISA.    See the picture of a 486 with vlb slots here: http://philipstorr.id.au/pcbook/showtell/show4.htm"

I hardly ever use them, but i would never sell them. once in a while you need the authentic feel of loading a tape and hoping is doesn't come up as corrupted. also c64 emulators (no matter how good) can NOT give you the feel of a SID chip. they emulate it, but in no way sounds right... it sounds like  britney spears singing aretha franklin songs, the notes are right  but it just doesn't feel the same.

I use it regularly (probably most days) for a month or two, for whatever bee I have in my bonnet about the whole thing, then I pack it away again until next time.  In 2000 (1 month) I spent some time working on a Bomberman game for it. In 2003 (3 months) I had it set up because I was writing a BBC Micro emulator for the PC and it was handy to have as a testbed. In 2010 (1 month) I thoroughly disassembled some ROM software I'd been using on it during those periods and created patches that added a few new features that I'd missed. In 2014 (2 months), I made a USB adapter to allow it to use my PC as a file server. In 2015 (1 month, probably), I've got another project on the go, that should be finished fairly soon.  2001-3, 2006-9, and 2011-13... it was in a box, in the corner of my spare room, gathering dust :)  (I bought a little LCD TV for it in 2014, which makes it easier to set up quickly. The USB adapter also helps - USB cables can be up to 5m in length, compared to the 75cm parallel port cable I used before, which gives more flexibility in terms of where I can put the thing. I can have it on the other side of the room, rather than having to balance it on the edge of the same desk as my PC. So I'll probably be using it more regularly in the future - because it's less bother to set it up for a few hours, then pack it away again.)"

I end up having stuff setup on my desk but it takes up a lot of room so it usually ends up getting put away once played with.   I'm currently trying to have my BBC setup all the time and connected continuously to my Econet network. Again this all has to fit in my small office (box room) as there is nowhere else for it.  This is helped by the fact that I've now purchased a VGA convertor which allows me to use it on one of my work monitors so I'm not having to have a separate CRT attached (although I would prefer that).  I have a larger storage room at a local storage company but there is no power there so its just for storing my machines. I've been in talks with the guy that owns it and I'm hopefully getting a power socket so I can at least power stuff up when I'm going maintenance tasks on bits of kit in there.  Ideally I want to have the machine connected and available at the flick of a switch. I think then I'm more likely to use it more as setting everything up is the main barrier to me playing around with stuff.  For me there is no substitute for the real machine. Emulators are fine for playing games etc but I think you miss the experience of the old machine which is a large part of it for me.

retrobattlestations,33ila1,mariuolo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"16550 UART:       The 16550 UART (universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter) is an integrated circuit designed for implementing the interface for serial communications. It is frequently used to implement the serial port for IBM PC compatible personal computers, where it is often connected to an RS-232 interface for modems, serial mice, printers, and similar peripherals.  The part was originally made by National Semiconductor. Similarly numbered devices, with varying levels of compatibility with the original National Semiconductor part, are made by other manufacturers. A UART function that is register-compatible with the 16550 is usually a feature of multifunction I/O cards for IBM PC-compatible computers, and may be integrated on the motherboard of other compatible computers.  Replacement of the factory-installed 8250 UART was a common upgrade for owners of IBM PC, XT, and compatible computers when high-speed modems became available. At speeds higher than 9600 baud, owners discovered that the serial ports of the computers were not able to handle a continuous flow of data without losing characters. Exchange of the 8250 (having only a one-byte received data buffer) with a 16550, and occasionally patching or setting system software to be aware of the FIFO feature of the new chip, improved the reliability and stability of high-speed connections.

Unless you loaded a game that turned it off.  4 - The battery is inside the A501 expansion board and you're going to need moderate-to-medium soldering skills even to pry it open. Unless you had a non official expansion without the RF shielding, that is.  6 - Do you have a terminal emulator on any of your disks?  8 - You could install 2.04 (A500+) or possibly even 3.1 (can't remember if they ever made it for the A500) but I think it would betray the purpose of retrocomputing. You only needed new ROMs to run 2.x workbench and you could always load it on the fly, RAM permitting. If anything, a 1.2 Kickstart would be more useful for some very old games that didn't run with 1.3.  Take everything I said with a grain of salt. I haven't touched an Amiga in several years."

Your best bet is the A520 but the quality on these is hit and miss, I have one that is actually good but the others I have seen suck.

You can partition it to have both FAT and Amiga partitions and use that to transfer files. heck you can even mount the CF card in linux using the amiga's filesystem to transfer files. Alternatively you can use CrossDOS on workbench to allow your Amiga to read 720Kb formatted DOS disks that windows can read and write to but it's a pain as you have to split down 880k disk images down to two smaller files to fit using LHA and recombine them on the amiga end. ADF2DISK is a great tool for the amiga to turn adf files back to actual floppies.  great way to restore your workbench disks if they've become corrupted after all these years.

Since you don't have Workbench and thus only booting games, it is common that the power light would go out. The reason is that the audio hardware had a low pass filter which was able to be disabled - and often was by games - and the power light as a result would either dim (A2000/3000/4000) or turn off (A500) to indicate this mode."

Shout outs to Pdp8online whose disk emulation system mine is based heavily on, and Stereosphere for the spare parts which have proved invaluable in narrowing down issues for repair. :-P  Oh, you also basically need a Symbolics MacIvory as well as VLM (OpenGenera on Linux and Alpha) can't speak chaos, and you need a server to back up your LMFS to :)  TL;DR Exhausting project, don't try it at home, and I'm very glad someone appreciates the outcome :)"

They were packed MONITOR ON TOP OF SYSTEM, with nothing at all separating them, not even newspaper. Then packed in a too-large box, with just some crumpled newspaper thrown in loosely. Amazingly, they both still work, but the box was obviously dropped at least once. The system had its plastic top-case cracked, and the top case of the internal floppy drive underneath was bent to the point of unusability. I had to bend the drive cage back to straight and swap in a new floppy drive. I used a few drops of super glue to get the crack in the top-case repaired ""good enough visually."" The monitor - again amazingly - works, but had MULTIPLE chunks in the plastic knocked out. One I was never able to get out, so still rattles around inside. CRT is fine (incredibly,) and I just live with a hole in the top of the case. The seller seemed surprised that it arrived damaged. Although he did completely refund me."

retrobattlestations,32uup0,musicalbacon,4,Fri Apr 17 03:33:57 2015 UTC,in theory could this computer  run mac os ?
retrobattlestations,32uup0,ahandle,26,Thu Apr 16 22:24:46 2015 UTC,"No.  Classic Mac OS is too tied to the Apple hardware.  In theory, if Apple and IBM had worked together to support it, sure.  But they didn't.  (Which is ironic, since about that time is when they DID work together to create the Apple Network Server series, which ran IBM's AIX!)  IBM's ""Personal Computer Power Series"" and ThinkPad Power Series could run four contemporary OSes: Windows NT (3.5 through 4.0 SP3) AIX Solaris (an extremely limited-distribution release.) OS/2 (an even more limited release than Solaris.)  Later, semi-obviously, various ports of BSD and Linux made their way to it.  To go on another tangent, there were four basic 'flavors' of PowerPC machine: Apple ""Old World"": Used on early 'beige' Apple PPC systems Apple ""New World"": Used on later 'colorful' Apple systems PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform): Early PPC desktop ""standard"" for cross-platform, basically the non-Apple equivalent of ""Old World"" - used by early IBM PowerPC systems. CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform): Later PPC desktop standard, even backed by Apple. This is what Apple's New World is based on, with further customizations. A few of the Apple clone makers were set to release CHRP-compliant systems that could run Windows NT or Mac OS 8, but Apple killed off the clone market before they were released.  Apparently Mac OS 8 has at its root the ability to run on CHRP systems that was disabled. It might be possible to hack Mac OS 8 to run on a CHRP system.  The PPC ThinkPads were PReP.  So completely different from CHRP that even the hacked-for-CHRP-support Mac OS 8 couldn't possibly run on it."

We also had had an RS/6000 one that looked identical, except it had an RS/6000 logo on it and came with AIX 4.1.x (I think, it is hard to remember) preinstalled... Anyway, the AIX support was not great. AIX only supported the one version for this model, which was also the only version that the ANS supported.  CHRP and PREP are very similar. One of the biggest difference between CHRP and PREP is that CHRP added support for MacOS, including a slot on the mainboard to hold Apple Toolbox roms. There are a few RS/6000 models with these slots. Interestingly, ""new"" world machines deleted the need for ROMs. I would be surprised if you could not get MacOS8.5 or 9 to boot on and RS/6000 43P. (604 desktop model)  Interestingly, when you boot an RS/6000 43P (and other models, I am sure) there is an Apple copyright notice (in addition to the IBM one) on the RS/6000 splash screen."

retrobattlestations,32wjjh,djronnieg,4,Fri Apr 17 08:32:19 2015 UTC,Those old pocketPC devices were great in their time. I had an ipaq and compaq gave them great support.  Even got to toy around with early mobile handheld linux experments on that old ipaq. Wifi and ethernet in a double PCMCIA sleeve baby!   Fun fact: These devices ran on Intel Arm processors! I always wondered if Intel is now kicking themselves for selling off that division. At one time they were /the/ mobile Arm chip maker.   Those were interesting times... Of course now I can pick up an android device literally anywhere and even run a distro chroot.

Presumably this was because PCMCIA devices could have power hungry 5 volt logic not intended for handheld devices.   (First party sleeves. There were a handful of 3rd party devices too, like a dual CF sleeve with a single battery)  My wifi card was CF! Worked fine in a bigger PCMCIA slot with a pin adapter. Used it in many laptops too. (In the days before built in wifi was omnipresent)  Used to run that and a 128 meg CF card in the ipaq. was pretty chunky even by standards of that day but it ran forever."

You basically won't be able to run any C64 or Apple software (aside from some simple basic programs), without using the same chips and wiring as an actual C64 or Apple.

My point is still valid although maybe the hardest parts are already done for you. You should examine his and the other guy's schematics though to be sure you have the same or equivalent hardware since their versions of BASIC are specific to their hardware arrangements.

Something a little more open and mainstream and not reliant on a single device containing most of the logic would be nice.

The first CDC 6600 was delivered in 1965 to the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland,  where it was used to analyse the two to three million photographs of bubble-chamber tracks that CERN experiments were producing every year. In 1966 another CDC 6600 was delivered to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, part of the University of California at Berkeley, where it was used for the analysis of nuclear events photographed inside the Alvarez bubble chamber.  The CDC 6600 is generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer, outperforming its fastest predecessor, the IBM 7030 Stretch, roughly by a factor of three. With performance of up to three megaFLOPS,   the CDC 6600 was the world's fastest computer from 1964 to 1969, when it relinquished that status to its successor, the CDC 7600.

Worst case scenario is that your faulty cable caused something inside the '64 to burn out and it can't put anything out over audio or video.

Doing the calculation and then setting the color to the intermediate variable solved  the program not working.  I know it's a simulator and I feel that generally it's good enough. I couldn't see an obvious reason for it to choke on the color aspect. HCOLOR works fine in it in other code. I do want to emphasize that I'd output was fine, just all the points were white.  I can't rule out a very slight chance of typos, but I did check and 'I'm pretty sure there weren't any. If I have time I'll try it again later."
retrobattlestations,325khu,istarian,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:13:43 2015 UTC,I just pasted the program into the calormen simulator and it works fine and has no problem with HCOLOR. The reason the pixels are all white is because it does not emulate the quirks of the Apple II hi-res screen.

I hate the noise the fly back makes on crts that scan in ntsc / pal frequencies. Computer monitors generally scan much faster so the noise is non existent. I did have a early 2000 era EDTV that double scanned everything into progressive and did not have that noise. It looked pretty good as well for older consoles.

retrobattlestations,31qjso,FozzTexx,3,Tue Apr 7 15:19:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. I had some hunches on how they were doing the color modes and this confirmed it -- they were using Apple II style techniques for composite color ... on a 640x200 output on composite you can easily make 16 colors that way and with dithering can get more. Some scenes in your video were in color on the Composite screen but looked just black and white with visible horizontal lines on the digital RGB display there.    More info here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II#Display_and_graphics  If you have seen Apple II color graphics on a Mono display, you'll know what I'm talking about.   Clever stuff by these demo creators. Using this mode you could get 16 colors in the 640x200 mode instead of just mono. I would think you had to do some bit-banging to turn on the NTSC colorburst when in the 640x200 mono mode.....  Also clearly they are doing more with those moves were sync is lost ... perhaps 50hz modes. Would be able to see what was going on with an oscilloscope."

But as he went along, the musical vibes got stranger and  stranger, then totally bizarre. He was playing chords on his flute. Combined with utterly unbelievable riffs. Much  of the audience got impatient and bored at what seemed  like a bunch of gawd-awful squawks.  Then I happened to notice a friend beside me who had  both been in and taught concert band. He was literally on  the edge of his seat. He turned to me and slowly said  ""you ... can’t ... do ... that ... with ... a ... flute"".

retrobattlestations,31tflk,Twiggy3,2,Mon May 18 16:22:36 2015 UTC,Very useful. Are those **key print codes unique to VIC20?
retrobattlestations,31tflk,swampyness,3,Wed Apr 8 13:51:49 2015 UTC,"Well, PET through the C128, and maybe the 264 line.  Z80/Spectrum do a similar thing AFAIK.  Next exercise, convert the string numerals to numbers with the VAL or CHR functions, and pull actual binary from that with another for next loop.  Or use a string array rather than a bunch of IF-THEN."
retrobattlestations,31tflk,classicsat,3,Wed Apr 8 14:28:58 2015 UTC,"Untested, but the following changes may well do the trick:  40 T = VAL(MID$(TI$,I,1)) 50 T$ = """" 60 FOR J% = 0 TO 3 70 B% = T AND 2↑(3-J%) 80 T$ = T$ + CHR$(209 - 6*(0 = B%)) 90 NEXT J% 100 110 REM REMOVE LINES 100 TO 130 120 130 140 PRINT T$   Similar code could be used to build a string array before the loop saving on calculating the binary for every digit every time the loop runs.  From a style point of view, tweaking a loop variable mid-loop to control flow is as confusing as a GOTO in my opinion, so I'd probably also change that around, like /u/RedditRage suggests elsewhere.  As to polling TI$ in a loop, that's also somewhat bad form as it can and will change while the loop is running. Imagine the clock rolling over from 115959 to 120000 just as I reaches 3. The final output would indicate that TI$ was 110000, which is not what is wanted.  I would probably take its value before the loop and then GOTO back to that line."

Line 70 is indeed a bitmask. It's possible parentheses are needed around the exponential there because I don't remember the precedence of operators any more. B% should end up as 8, 4, 2 or 1, or 0 if the respective bit isn't set.  Line 80 takes advantage of the fact that False is 0 and True is -1. The CHR$ will be code 209 (Shift-Q) when B% is anything other than 0 and 215 (Shift-W) when it is 0.  Putting 0 before the equals sign is a trick learned from other programming languages to signify that a comparison rather than an assignment is happening there. It should work just fine on a Commodore."

It reminds me of the word ""idlers"", but it couldn't be a variant of this word that's represented as a contraction, since no characters are omitted in the position where you put the apostrophe.    Perhaps it's meant to represent a glottal stop, but then what word is pronounced like ""idlers"", but with a glottal stop in between the last two syllables?  Some people might pronounce ""idlers"" in a fashion that makes it sound like three syllables, but that would just create a short schwa sound between the ""d"" and the ""l"", not a glottal stop after the ""l"" sound.   I'm afraid I have no idea what this word could possibly be intended to mean, and that unfortunately eliminates any possibility of extracting meaning from the sentence that contains it, and therefore from the paragraph that contains the sentence.

After receiving a failing grade in school, he uses his IMSAI 8080 microcomputer to hack into the district's computer system. He then counter canters his grade and does the same for his friend and classmate Jennifer Mack.   Later, while dialing every number in Sunnyvale, California to find a set of forthcoming computer games, a computer that does not identify itself intrigues Broderick to go above the bit. On the computer he finds a list of games, starting with general strategy games like chess, checkers, backgammon, english pleasure, and poker and then progressing to titles like ""Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare"" and ""Global Thermonuclear War"", but cannot proceed further.   Two of his hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and indirect rein and suggest tracking down the Parker referenced in ""Parker Maze"", the first game listed. Matthew discovers that Parker is an emerging star in the equine world. This entire process causes Broderick to reach within his character role and eventually his married life to fuck a horse for the rest of his life."

I also thought about  floor gaps or trapdoors, but that would require more code and some way of getting around the holes in the floor. I was having trouble figuring how to do a sideways jump in applesoft basic, given that there are chiefly only two input mechanisms ('get' and 'input') and both are blocking, which is to say the program stops to wait for input. There's no neat way, that I now of, to allow me to get two inputs at once (e.g. 'up' and 'right' simultaneously). If I worked out how to use the paddles, maybe I could do that. It think the emulators maps some keys to the paddle inputs...  Unfortunately you can't omit the section comments in typing it without adjusting the goto and gosub numbers. Lines 0-7 aren't strictly necessary though and lines 20,25 and 70-78 could be omitted if you didn't want the ""logo screen"".    NOTE: It's probably obvious, but READ and RESTORE are used with the DATA statements for anyone that cares."

Since I think you can insert arbitrary lines with the default ""editor"", you may want to leave 77 (if you want the ""logo"" bit) and 132 for last since they are both a bit longer (at least 10-15 more characters) than the rest of the lines."

retrobattlestations,31lbvl,charonpdx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"sorry. :(    Glommed together commands save visual space/lines to type. Obviously you can separate, in most cases, anything with a colon between it into separate lines (one line per statement in front of, between, or after a colon). Unfortunately I don't expect reliable function when you mess around with loops and if then when things aren't placed correctly. Anything that's an IF condition would either have be some kind of nested/multiple IF to make it a single line.  You could, maybe, turn line 132:    132 IF X + 2 >= BX(I) AND X + 2 <= BX(I) + 5 AND HIT(I) = 0 THEN TS = TS + 1 : HIT(I) = 1    into multiple lines.    renumber line 18 to be line 19 add line: 18  D = 0 remove line 132, 133 renumber line 134, 135 to be line 138, 139 add lines: 132 D = 1 : REM SUPPOSE A COLLISION OCCURRED 133 IF X + 2 < BX(I)        THEN D = 0 134 IF X + 2 > BX(I) + 5  THEN D = 0 135 IF HIT(I) == 1           THEN D = 0 136 IF D == 1 THEN TS = TS + 1 : HIT(I) = 1 137 NEXT   Making, of course, the appropriate changes to the line numbers as directed. These lines would sit inside the for loop (between FOR and NEXT), just like the original line 132. This seems to work fine as far as the emulator goes. It is a lot of lines added though (1 -> 5). You only need one space between the end of the test condition and the THEN statement even though I added more for readability.  This works by assuming the new variable, D (for detected collision), to be 1 (a collision) at the start and then testing for conditions under which a collision does not occur rather than when it does occur. This change amounts to OR'ing a negative version of the checks as opposed to AND'ing positive ones. Then at the end, we see if there was a collision and make two changes (increase TS, temp score, by 1 and change HIT(I), whether we hit that box, to 1)."

retrobattlestations,31lbvl,FozzTexx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Okay. Not sure why your line there separates ""SCORE"" into ""SC OR E"", that's definitely not the way it's supposed to be. You could try changing 'score' to 'sco' (given that applesoft only distinguishes on the first 3 characters) wherever it's used if that's a problem. That one variable name is likely the issue, unless for some reason it doesn't like multiple statements on the same line separated by colons?    Honestly, it may just not like the reserved keyword 'or' being used as part of a variable name, in which case the ""SCORE""->""SCO"" change I suggested above would probably fix that issue.  Other than that, it should work afaik. What hardware are you using?"
retrobattlestations,31lbvl,FozzTexx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"Applesoft only looks at the first 2 characters for variable names. Yes, it sees the OR keyword in the middle and tokenizes it separately. I'm using a genuine Apple IIe. You might want to try a better emulator like this one or Sweet 16 which emulates a IIgs.

retrobattlestations,31lbvl,charonpdx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, well... Stupid hardware/rom. :P 'SC' should be just as good as score, given that there are no name collisions. Clearly I meant 2 characters, but I remember 3 for some reason. I'll try to update the code in the post for that.  It may be a poor simulator, but generally it's good enough and can be run in any browser (especially on machines I don't own...).  I don't tend to have my Apple IIe near me often (being at college) and even if I did, writing new code on the real hardware is more of a trial than using a text editor and is much slower for revisions. Anyone with a brain would write their code on paper first. Which is incidentally much harder to lose due to accidental reset/crash/power loss and can be 'saved' without a disk drive/cassette recorder. :)    I suppose I could run Sweet16 on my powermac G4 w OSX 10.4.11 which I do have here at school. :) The latest version probably works on the school Macs... I'd have to go find a IIgs rom file in either case, though. The javascript emulator looks snazzy, but is subject to similar pain as using the real thing given that it's a simulator. Looking at all, or a substantial portion, of the code at once is a prized modern convenience."

retrobattlestations,313wkc,callmelightningjunio,10,Thu Apr 2 01:39:42 2015 UTC,"Really depends on your definition of retro. They're definitely obsolete by modern standards and hard to use without careful acquisition of software that is, mostly, long since dropped, unsupported, and (in terms of actual discs/books) hard to obtain. Also they can only just barely, with the notable exception with caveats of Classilla, access recent websites in a -functional- manner much less  how the site was intended to be browsed.

retrobattlestations,313wkc,istarian,3,Thu Apr 2 04:42:09 2015 UTC,"I find they run well with a Linux distro, like MintPPC (essentially Debian) which lets you use modern browsers and other software, as well as USB wifi dongles (I ran a Blueberry model like that for a couple of years before turning it into a MacOS gaming machine)."
retrobattlestations,313wkc,UncleSlacky,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true, but if I have a mac I'd rather run MacOS. Besides, I am bit nostalgic about these models since we had the colored iMac G3s when I was in elementary school.  Also, while PPC Linux distributions do exist for the Mac, the packages for most of them are probably somewhat out of date and I doubt there is much active development for the architecture.  I haven't used MintPPC so it's hard to compare anything to that, but I doubt there very many browsers for PPC Macs that are as up to date as Classilla at the moment, granted that different OSs have different software. Iceweasel might be better, but that's only likely to be true because you don't have a old version of MacOS to deal with and Debian has maintained support for the PPC architecture. They've had their fork/branch? of Firefox for a long time afaik (i.e. they had it before Firefox dropped support for PPC).    If it works half as well on a mac as their screenshots looks then it's probably viable for anything with 1gb or more of ram."
retrobattlestations,313wkc,istarian,2,Fri Apr 3 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"Dude, it's a powerpc mac. They run OSX and modern software, they're just a bit slow."
retrobattlestations,313wkc,TheScriptKiddie,2,Tue Apr 7 05:19:18 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, each version of OS X generally has a fair number of substantial changes. It' not quite windows xp -> vista, but it isn't' nothing either.Also, OS X dropped PowerPC support back at version 10.5. The current  version is 10.10. Without several hacks the iMac  G3 I have will not run anything newer than 10.3.9 Which saw it's last update/release back in 2005 (that's getting close to 10 years--ago). there are very few workable web browsers that can use a modern website on it. The software out there written specifically for it and not a later model was written for OS 9 Which it shipped with back in 1998 (16+ years ago) and is not remotely modern by comparison. Back then, you know when most people got their internet over dialup, if they had it all. It would be difficult to do most jobs requiring a computer with it these days. Also, if you think it's a bit slow, try getting by in life with a pentium II computer, because the standard processor for this machine is 233 mhz and that's single core (not dual or quad core and definitely not 2-3 ghz like the machine you probably browse reddit with). It also maxes out at 512mb of ram (far less than the 4-8gb you are used to having) The last version of Java that will run under 10.3/10.4 is Java 1.5 (aka Java 5), the current version is Java 8 (aka 1.8). Java 5 was released in 2004 ( almost 11 years ago). You couldn't run the earliest version of minecraft available on this machine, because that requires Java 6 and Likely more memory, graphics chip,   and processing Power than this poor machine has. -- just so you know, most people search abandonware sites for versions of software that will run on OS 9 and it's not much better for OS x 10.4 unless you're prepared to compile source code yourself (when available) for PPC assuming that it will compile right and doesn't depend on things that won't compile or are dependent on a later or different processor' features. There are no mainstream developers creating new commercial software or even updating older software to be usable today unless it's a legacy support project of fairly narrow scope. In fact there last version of iTunes that will run on Mac OS X 10.4 is iTunes 9 ( current version is 11 point something). It is officially obsolete and The hardware and software would be considered legacy ( gone, phased out, or In the process of being rapidly phased out.) if there was no TenFourFox, you'd be hard pressed to read your webmail and might have to resort to command line clients or writing your own software to even be able to communicate with a modern email server to get your email. You could word process I suppose, but you'll probably have to transfer your files elsewhere to print or use a fairly old printer that the Mac OS has drivers for, but it'll have to be usb or a network printer. You won't be playing very many games and they'll probably be 10+ years old and running at the lowest or second lowest graphics setting. Forget using anything USB that isn't Cairo old and either a: printer, mouse, keyboard, external cd/dvd/hard drive, thumbdrive, or some esoteric hardware that you may not be able to find or get the drivers for anyway if their even were any.  Just to be clear, just browsing the web on one of these can be painfully slow and you can forget anything using flash and most things that use html5 tech. You're lucky if the JavaScript doesn't crash and stuff is rendered correctly and where it's supposed to be.  Firefox didn't exist yet and IE wasn't at version six when the computer was being sold. CSS v1 was only a year or two old. Safari didn't exist either. All of that came around at about the same time as The first release of Mac OS X.  So imagine a machine that was 'built for win95' and trying to ru later service packs of winXP or Vista on it and that's like the experience you'll have using an early iMac G3 with OS x 10.4. Keep in mind that Windows XP had support up through 2009 (five years after Apple moved past the vestiges of 10.4) though and companies had to cope with it because people still used it. Apple and Mac users rarely enjoy such continuous support for an OS versions and developers move on (they also had a tiny fraction of the market share for a long time).  P.S. My model and, I believe most of them has USB 1.1, not even USB 2. The ram in it is PC66 SDRAM. That's NOT DDR of any variety nor is it PC100. It runs at 66mhz. It's SDR."
retrobattlestations,313wkc,istarian,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:56:42 2015 UTC,"You're right, you can't get new software for these outside of installing Linux. But they do run old yet fairly compatible versions of Firefox, Office, and Photoshop. I know a guy who still uses one as his only machine. He's insane for doing it, but he does. I've got a PowerBook G4 sitting around and it's obviously a lot faster than these, but it is very useful. You can even play Quake 3.  I'm not knocking OP, just playing devil's advocate."
retrobattlestations,313wkc,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"On the Firefox thing, no not really. Firefox 3.6.28 is the last version that works with PPC and 10.4/10.5. That version is pretty out of date (3 years of active development out of date). I get that you might be referring to Classilla/TenFourFox but it's not clear enough to call them Firefox and those are not fairly old, they're fairly new since they involve active backporting. Office and Photoshop is a different story and I'll grant that they're usable, but anyone doing real work would probably find the computer too slow or to have insufficient memory. It might be fine for relatively small work that no one else but you needs to work with but working with an older version has a number of downsides. You don't necessarily have compatibility with newer versions, any bugs that exist will never be fixed, and you don't have any useful new features that might exist in the immediately following version. Also, unless you get it from an abandonware site which could get you in legal trouble if you try to make any money using it, people sometime want more than they're worth for the discs/reference material. Some people think certain things retain value forever and that's not really how it works.  I'd consider your Powerbook G4 pretty dated too, just not quite as restricted. Still a case where installing Linux would afford more flexibility despite the fact that  OS X is built on top of Unix. Does anyone actually play Quake?"
retrobattlestations,313wkc,istarian,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Apple has a nasty habit of obsoleting their old hardware after about 2-3 years, and most Mac software developers tend not to support hardware or versions of Mac OS X that are not being actively supported. I think the oldest version of Mac OS X that you can find a modern browser for would be 10.6, which these PowerPC iMacs would not run, even if they had the power (10.6 came out for Intel Macs only.) Sure, there's a lot of great Mac OS 9 and early OS X abandonware out there, including a lot of awesome games, but you really wouldn't want to use a G3 iMac as a primary computer nowadays."

This piece is a little bit of nostalgia for me, because i had to use one of those back in school in computer science class. It was the same blue model with the exact mouse and keyboard. It came only with 192 MB of RAM installed and the hard disk was pretty loud for a system without any fans. Furthermore there were a lot of programs that would not work and I wanted a clean installation of Mac OS. So I upgraded the RAM to 1 GB and installed a hard disk with 80 GB. But the only affordable hard disk under 128 GB (I’ve read that the iMacs hard disk controller could not handle more GB than that.) ran with 7200 rpm. The original hard disk ran with 5400 rpm and people on the internet suggested that the higher speed could cause heating problems. Other sources said that the increased speed would not be an issue. Hope anyone here has any suggestions. Because I imagine that the iMac now becomes hotter, than it used to be (Maybe I imagining things, but I do not want to damage the Mac). The iMac came in it's original state with installed Mac OS 9.1 but after I swapped the hard drives I installed Mac OS 9.2.2.   Hope you guys have some suggestions what to do with the iMac and hopefully some ideas if the hard disk thing will be an issue."

These will run 10.4, And 10.4 still runs 'Classic' so you'll still have access to 9.x and 68k programs. The previous major break was at 8.0 when a lot of file handling calls changed. Many 7.x and earlier programs won't run on 8.0 and up.  There was a couple of functionality breaks that you might want to be aware of in the early generations of 10.x. 10.0 through early 10.2 were one generation that seemed to be pretty compatible as to what ran. 10.2.8 to 10.4 were another family. 10.5 dropped support for classic."

Mac Purists were quick to point to the low-end specs of my machine when I denounced Mozilla/Gecko as a CPU pig.  I never had the pleasure of talking to a Mac Purist who understood how the different subsystems of computers fit together to determine the total performance of the system; they all seemed to think that performance was based on how recently you bought the thing, and how much you paid.  Anyway... Gecko is still a CPU pig.  You can install OS X 10.4 on your iMac with the help of XPostFacto.  It will work well.  As the owner of a slot-loading iMac, you need not worry about the ""8GB limit"".  You can browse the web via Safari (or any other KHTML/Webkit -based browser.  You can run Adium (man I miss Adium).

Randolph, a saxophonist, popularized the selection in his 1963 recording; Benny Hill later made it more widely known as the de facto theme music of his comedy show.  The selection, which includes pieces of assorted fiddle tunes, was composed for a performance at a venue called The Armory in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Two bars of ""Entrance of the Gladiators"" and ""The Girl I Left Behind"" are also worked into it.  The piece was inspired by sax solo in the Leiber and Stoller song ""Yakety Yak,"" recorded in 1958 by The Coasters.  The tunes are similar, and both feature the ""yakety sax"" sound.

They seem really expensive on amazon. They make atx->at power converters. A 486dx already has a corprocessor.  A Weitek might be faster, but I doubt you can tell the difference given how slow this system is going to be anyway? As I recall, you had to indicate the kind of video card you were plugging into a motherboard with that jumper.  I don't know why it was required, but it was. Maybe.  I've never seen it done and it's almost certainly not worth the trouble.  There are plenty of uses for the 8 bit slot (serial ports?) I bet 64 will work.  I wouldn't spend much on 64mb  of ram though.  While 64mb of ram is entirely too small for much, once you are that low on ram, 32 isn't bad.  I'm thinking specifically about dos and windows 3.11, etc. applications. Maybe.  I doubt it though.  I spent a few years setting jumpers on motherboards (used to be a tech back in college).  I never saw anything surprising.  Someone else might know better though. On at power, you're going to wonder how to plug in the two connectors.  Be sure the black wires are next to each other.

It might be a matter of adjusting the boot displays to be more legible.  A monochrome VGA screen basically only shows the green input, so if it was going to display, say, a logo or error in red, that would not be ideal.   In response to /u/joecodemonkey below, I think it was because CGA and MDA cards didn't have their own BIOS, but VGA and possibly EGA did, so they had to initialize it first before it could start displaying output.    You probably don't need any more slots than you already have.  The 8-bit-only slot was good, though, for some old and stupidly designed cards that assumed that there would never be 16-bit slots... so they extended the board into the area that the 16-bit connector ended up taking up."

retrobattlestations,30h4r9,FozzTexx,1 point,Fri Mar 27 09:42:34 2015 UTC,Figuring out that the IBM basic hated that took me a while. I absolutely could not figure out how it was jumping to the statements after the NEXT when it wasn't even executing the statements on the same line before the NEXT! Then I realized that the interpreter was just absolutely loopy and was just scanning the code when it hit a FOR and looking for a NEXT and then jumping there if it decided it wasn't going to execute the FOR. Which is also strange because I've never seen a FOR/NEXT act as a conditional.

I'm now wondering if there's some insane hack that could take advantage of the odd execution path. Some kind of obfuscated BASIC challenge. ;-)  The disk image probably doesn't belong in the repo but it was quick and easy so I put it there.

It makes some sense, because you aren't really returning to a line, you are popping the last loop variable location from the stack (and the stack does contain the relevant line). It isn't a simple DJNZ instruction (this is Z80 assembly: Decrement and Jump if Non-Zero. I don't know the 6502 equivalent).  On Amstrad's Locomotive BASIC you can run out of memory if you have too many nested FOR/NEXT loops. In fact, in Locomotive BASIC the FOR/NEXT stack is the same as the GOSUB/RETURN and WHILE/WEND stacks. They have a size of 0x1ff bytes, so, if you use more than about 80 nested FOR/NEXT, GOSUB/RETURN or WHILE/WEND loops, you'll get a stack overflow, or as Locomotive BASIC calls it, Memory Full."

I assembled an MCX-128 kit yesterday which bumps the RAM up from the paltry 4k to 128k, giving 32k to BASIC. It also adds an improved BASIC which makes it more compatible with the TRS-80 CoCo and allows you to use another computer as a file server so you don't have to use cassette I/O. That was great because I could do my edits in Notepad instead of on the horrible MC-10 keyboard.  Since the MC-10 & CoCo don't have split-screen graphics with text, I simply made the game pause after it's finished drawing and wait for a keypress. It'll then jump back to the text screen, read the two inputs, then go back to graphics and draw. There was also no (easy) way to position the text cursor, and the screen is so much smaller than 80 columns anyway that I just ditched all the cursor movement stuff and let it make a huge mess with the menu.  This version will most likely work on a CoCo.  Now let's see if someone can port it to the 48k Speccy!"

I bought it because it was on special offer... for some reason? See http://rt.com/uk/202507-tesco-isis-brand-tv/ - mine wasn't as good value as the £64 22"" one the article mentions, sadly, being a 19"" one that cost around £80. But that article was written early November, and I think I bought mine mid-October, so maybe the discounts weren't in full effect.  As I recall, my purchase still represented much better value than any other I could find at the time, particularly at that size, which was why I bought it the moment I saw it. Costco's 17"" one, one of the cheaper competitors, was a good £60+ more expensive.   (The TV isn't absolutely the greatest, and the inbuilt DVD player is a bit noisy, but the picture quality is decent enough, the menu system is easy to use, and it has a fair selection of inputs: 1 x HDMI, 1 x SCART, 1 x composite, 1 x RCA+stereo. Also a USB socket, which I imagine will play DivX/H264/etc., but I've never used that.)  [Edit: black electrical tape has now been applied, so the ISIS logo is now invisible!

You can get modern replacement parts (capacitors, resistors, potentiometers etc) cheaply and most valves for a price, check if the flyback /HV transformer is somewhat OK. Any wax slag at the bottom of the high voltage cage indicates it got hot any cracks can invite moisture which can give HV issues.

If it tests good, go for it, otherwise if baking the heater and restoring don't help or it has shorts that aren't removed with ""short removal"", a new CRT of that vintage isn't cheap or common  There are lots of videos on YouTube of people restoring old TV's like this, they may even do your particular model and will show the schematic clearly enough and (dis)assembly procedures"

I believe you can also set up the control sequences in the printer settings for selecting different fonts and cpis. I've never gotten those control sequences to really work however, but it usually works fine for simple text jobs.   I've forgotten the name already but I did find a nice (but shareware) text file editor for windows that supports DOS ANSI drawing characters but also seems to support printer fonts natively.

They were pretty awful in just about every respect, except for one: they had such nice mono monitors. Very restful on the eyes, like the Atari ST ones, but much larger and much higher quality.  Also, most people hated using them, so you'd always be able to find one free. PCs by comparison were permanently oversubscribed.  Browsing the web on them was quite good, at least for text sites. Performance was vastly better than shown in the video, as I recall, though this being a while ago now it's possible my standards were lower. Maybe even text sites these days are also much more demanding due to greater use of Javascript and general lack of concern over bandwidth and so on.

It pisses me off every time because of this:   I vented about the problems to Tyler, mentioned that I was in for a long stretch of coding to solve it, and was surprised when he whipped up a filtering proxy solution in about 20 minutes using Python, Requests, Flask, and Beautiful Soup. The key to it all was that MacWeb would include the full URL, with the hostname, when making a proxy request. Requests fetched the URL, stripping SSL and managing any cookies. BeautifulSoup stripped out things that MacWeb couldn’t understand, like CSS, Javascript, images, and DIVs. Flask pulled proxy duties, reading the request and sending the filtered result back to the Mac.   That's awesome article writer guy. Maybe want to share this supposedly simple code? I have some old machines I would love to get on the modern web to just do it but the fact they don't support HTTP1.1 or HTML4+ is a real show stopper. A filtering proxy is just what I and I'm sure plenty of other people need. I've looked up a lot of different solutions and none of them have been turn-key or even relatively easy to get set up.

retrobattlestations,301lhq,ahandle,3,Mon Mar 23 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"Not really. The Symbolics keyboard was modeled on earlier keyboards. Emacs was developed in 1976, five years before Symbolics was coming out with the LM-2, which was still very much an MIT design. The 3600 got the new and more compact Symbolics keyboard. The one we see here on the pictures happened a few years later - I guess it was released with the Ivory machines, but I'm not sure."

retrobattlestations,301lhq,lispm,3,Tue Mar 24 06:12:23 2015 UTC,I thought the Emacs keybindings were influenced by the Knight keyboard by Tom Knight who later designed the Space-cadet keyboard which Symbolics also made.

The Knight keyboard was already influenced by the SAIL keyboard from 1971, which already had Control and Meta.

So yeah, more braces than you're used to. It is, however, completely uniform, predictable and unambiguous. Some people don't like it, others miss it when they're forced to write in other languages."

retrobattlestations,300lvg,temalyen,3,Tue Mar 24 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of the IBM 1620, which did table lookup for addition and subtraction. The 1620 had the code name CADET, which was often expanded as Can't Add Doesn't Even Try. Apparently you could load different values into the addition table, which would really mess up the next user.  The 1401 has hardware addition/subtraction using bizarre qui-binary addition internally. The optional hardware multiplication/division used a whole pile of circuitry to do base-10 multiplication and division by performing repeated addition or subtraction. It supports arbitrary-length numbers; I timed multiplication of two 1000-digit numbers and it took just under a minute. And remember, this is all in hardware - no software or even microcode - just registers and logic gates and latches built out of individual transistors. The story I heard is they made multiplication/division an extra-cost option so they could meet the price target of $2500 a month ($20,000 a month in current dollars) for the basic system."

That's why it's called the Mandelbrot set it's the person who brought it to the worlds attention. People forget that Mandelbrot at the time was seen as a complete and utter nutcase for going on about fractals.  That's the difference.

There is a data terminal directly attached to the mainframe as well that you could directly address it on.

retrobattlestations,2zml14,istarian,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, it appears to be ESD foam — but peeling plastic off a roll typically generates a tremendous amount of static electricity (hence why Kapton tape is used instead of Scotch tape, as its one of the exceptions). Why be counterproductive like that?"
retrobattlestations,2zml14,ThePowerOfDreams,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:21:53 2015 UTC,Presumably because it's cheap and usually isn't a problem. I expect that Kapton tape would be rather expensive to use to seal packaging for a one-off multi-shipment of a bunch of components. The same goes for buying resealable anti-static bags. Big companies can just make those one-time use bags for cheap or something.
retrobattlestations,2zml14,istarian,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Kapton tape was merely an example of a plastic film that doesn't cause ESD issues — the industry goes to the expense of using it because they need to. I'm not saying this seller should have used it; I'm saying they should not have used something so amateurish and ESD-inducing as Saran Wrap.  Static bags are a dime a dozen on eBay or from suppliers like Digi-Key or Mouser (AKA the same places the seller got that ESD foam). There is no excuse, especially when selling vintage or otherwise hard-to-find parts —and those parts haven't been manufactured in a long time.  ""It's cheap and usually isn't a problem"" is pretty much the worst possible thing a supplier could say to me, especially for labour-of-love projects like this."

My father was a professor at Cooper Union, an engineering college in NYC. However these photos look like they are from when he was a student teacher at the University of Buffalo or maybe U of Wisconsin before that.   I did grow up with a lot of O-scopes and similar devices in my basement, and my father constantly brought home old computers to teach me how to use them or to take apart. I first learned basic on a computer than had no multi-line screen- just a single Nixie line of alpha numeric characters."

I have to photograph the oldest piece of computer hardware that I have- one byte of memory made of coiled copper wire that my dad used to show his students. It is from one of the first mainframe computers in the world and it is taped on an index card saying that this one piece of memory was $16,000. Which I don't get because it looks rather simple. Maybe someone on this sub can finally solve its mystery for me.  Edit: my memory in my brain is as useless as the old chunk of wire-based memory my father saved so long ago: I had it all wrong. the memory was probably not very expensive and the computer that it came from was an IBM 1620 from around 1960.

retrobattlestations,2zhr0d,cogburnd02,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"Magnetic-core memory:       Magnetic-core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years (circa 1955–75). It uses tiny magnetic toroids (rings), the cores, through which wires are threaded to write and read information. Each core represents one bit of information. The cores can be magnetized in two different ways (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the bit stored in a core is zero or one depending on that core's magnetization direction. The wires are arranged to allow an individual core to be set to either a ""one"" or a ""zero"", and for its magnetization to be changed, by sending appropriate electric current pulses through selected wires. The process of reading the core causes the core to be reset to a ""zero"", thus erasing it. This is called destructive readout.    Image i - A 32 x 32 core memory plane storing 1024 bits of data.

These worked pretty well from my experience, but I've probably not needed one since the 90s.  For a while pretty much all retail hard drives shipped with a floppy that had something like this.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_drive_overlay  Wikipedia confirms what I also remember - That 99% of these programs were all licensed versions of Ontrack's overlay. Ontrack is still around, sort of, http://www.krollontrack.com/. I don't know if they sell that product anymore but you can probably find old versions to download.

The technology was continued with similar types of problems up to the LBA-48 extension.  This technique overrides some of the motherboard BIOS' hard disk controller driver in RAM. To allow access to the full size of any hard disk the software must be loaded before other programs try to access the upper parts of a disk with a critical size. To ensure that this extension gets loaded early most often the boot disk's master boot record is modified and the software installed at the beginning of the disk.  The most widespread vendor for such an extension is the company Ontrack which is licensing its DDO component to several of the major hard disk vendors for integration into their management tools and into their products.

I grew up on this sort of hardware and can fill in some of the blanks for you.   -That HP motherboard is missing jumpers because they were not required for the computer. HP uses reference boards built by companies like MSI and ASUS and reconfigures them depending on their application.   -Those Pentium II chips run on slot 1 architecture, which replaced socket 7. A lot of slot 1 motherboards are compatible with Pentium II, Celeon and Pentium III CPUs.  -That Pentium MMX is probably a 133 MHz or less, as the 166MHz, 200MHz and 233MHz usually needed a heat-sink and fan for cooling. In fact the 133 MHz should have one as well but yours has no evidence of thermal paste on the core surface.  -The lone connector on that one motherboard is an AT keyboard port. This was original standard for keyboards before PS/2 came along.   -The slots in your last motherboard picture are for EDO RAM, which was a common standard before SDRAM.   -Lastly, you can find a PCI or ISA graphics card at most thrift stores, although I would suggest PCI if you have the slots.

I have seen SDI using various different IDs the card reports to find the correct driver. It uses a 3rd party driver database which is maintained by users, which decreases the chance for false-positives because chances are high, somebody added an exception list for it. SDI itself has only a handful of IDs hardcoded that seem to mess up, usually related to some generic intel chips (PCI vendor ID 8086)"

Also last time it ran, about 4 years ago its been having a problem.   Its stuck in 16 color mode instead of 256 color mode which allows it to play games. Switching back in display settings does work, the option is there, but once you restart to apply the settings (it prompts you to) you get back onto the desktop and nothings been changed. Its still 16 0.0  So this at the time was preventing me from playing any retro games.  I believe the problem was that it was thermal throttling because of all the dust choking it and the fact that the thermal paste is powder. It was running so hot it was protecting itself so it couldn't switch, so it just defaults to 16 if you try to switch.  What do you think of this?"
retrobattlestations,2zbspy,gravitone,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"Could be a number of things.

Don't forget the nvidia detonator drivers. I doubt its a thermal throttling feature though. Those didn't even exist yet in videocards at the time as far as im aware. Let me know how it works out.  Also don't forget the chipset drivers. Without proper AGP GART support you can get eratic behaviour. Your board seems to be based on the FIC SD11, and can even be flashed with a proper bios for that particular board. It uses a weird hybrid AMD northbridge / VIA southbridge combo, so you need both the amd agp/chipset driver package from the amd website, and the via 4in1 for the soutbridge (ide,usb,etc.)."

I absolutely loved it. Saw this at goodwill and had to get it for a display piece. I believe this is the original released model before some of the creators left and started handspring and then this was rebranded as the Palm Pilot. It was $5.99. I remember my visor costing at least $300 plus another few hundred for the modem, keyboard, expansion packs, and case. 512kb of memory. I saw somewhere they touted it had the same computing power as the Apple SE."
retrobattlestations,2z6fb7,mareksoon,4,Mon Mar 16 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"I guess they were released around the same time, but there was a USR Palm Pilot 1000 prior to this; I say prior because the one with smaller memory HAD to be first! ;-)  Branded as USR, it IS an early model ... before the 3com acquisition.   source: had one."
retrobattlestations,2z6fb7,EkriirkE,2,Mon Mar 16 03:08:02 2015 UTC,Yeah. It wasn't clear in the articles I read about wether the 1000 and the 5000 were released at the same time or the 5000 just after. It was released in 1996.

retrobattlestations,2z6fb7,redisforever,2,Mon Mar 16 08:29:12 2015 UTC,"Or close enough, anyway. It is a descendant of the Motorola 68000, and code-compatible with it.  The Pilot 5000 had a 16 MHz CPU, 512 kb of RAM, and no ""permanent"" storage (if the batteries died, including the backup battery, you lost your data.)  The original Macintosh had an 8 MHz CPU, 128kb of RAM, and a 400 kb floppy drive.    Since the Pilot 5000 had to use RAM for data storage in addition to operating memory, it's about a wash - the early OS used very little operating memory, so most of it was available to storage.  So a Pilot 5000 is probably roughly equivalent to having an original 1984 Macintosh in your pocket."

The amount of great freeware and shareware was amazing. Datebk4 remains the most useful calendaring app I've ever used.  I also programmed a bunch of apps in that BASIC (edit: looked it up, yBasic) for it that you wrote in the notes app. I made a bus time tables app, game of Life, etc. It was great being able to just sit and code when you were bored, and the batteries could last for weeks.  I started out with a Palm IIIx, my dad was intrigued and borrowed it for a week and right away ended up getting a Vx. My mom eventually got an m130 and my dad upgraded to something newer and I inherited his Vx.

It's a newer model, just before the Treo line. Can't remember the exact model, though. He uses it to store passwords.   And speaking of freeware, I remember playing a black and white 3D (or 2.5D) FPS game called, I think, IQ3D. It was just the first level and I don't think the final game was ever released, but it was a lot of fun. I also played a ton of Lemmings and used DrawIt a lot.

I got these machines from a guy who drinks at my local pub, he's worked in IT since the early 80s and has worked with such programming languages as Pascal and Delphi. He has a shipping crate in his garden jam packed full of computer and audio equipment and fireworks (he does that as a side business and hobby).  He heard that I was a collector of vintage computer equipment and offered it all to me for free, both include original carry cases.  Back in the day, these machines ran software called IM Link that was created by the guy who I got the machines from. The machines where for electronic imaging in hospitals and used to run CT and MRI machines. They still have the software on them, but that's going to be wiped off shortly as they also contain patient data.  The both contain modems to send the imaging data and a special imaging card to send the images of the scans to 9"" black and white monitors via BNC. I'm going to grab one of the monitors off the guy at some point and get some photos (masking personal data, of course).  Anyway, pretty cool stuff!

To configure these it might help to look at the other bsds like indeed openbsd or netbsd. Things will get better when you can load the loader. Using tcpdump in these early stages can be very helpfull too. Also, you'll have to rename the loader to a file which is the ip adress you want the client to have in hexadecimal (you convert each number to a hexadecimal one; 10.0.0.1 becomes 0A000001).

It seems as generic a late 80s PC clone can be, except has some I/O card which has a 50 pin header, rather than a D-sub.

retrobattlestations,2z26zn,classicsat,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:42:30 2015 UTC,Can you explain that in more simpler terms (I have no idea what most of that ment)
retrobattlestations,2z26zn,classicsat,3,Sun Mar 15 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"For the IBM: In most cases, a desktop PC would have the power supply (converts mains AC 120V or 230V to  DC 5V and 12V to power the chips and drives) in the system case, like it is in the KT system. The monitor would have a separate power cord.  That IBM model has the power supply in the monitor, why, likely to make the system a bit more compact, and un-standard because IBM clones (like the KT) were a problem for them so they kept re-defining their PC hardware.  The KT is what these days would be a ""whitebox"" system, in that a small builder would buy off the shelf generic parts from Taiwan or the like, by the hundreds, or less as they sell them, maybe even using the best deal in available parts when the need to buy them.  That one has, as it appears, has an multi I/O card (parallel, 2 serial,maybe FDD/IDE HDD if it is a newer AT), and a Trident or similar VGA/EGA graphic card (my first 286 had a similar card, with 15 pin, 9 pin,and some DIP switches).  An XT or older AT probably has an MFM HDD and controller card (sometimes with FDD controller, and no rear connectors). The XT would have its own BIOS, the AT would support the HDD directly in BIOS (but may need a setup disk/program to set up).  A quick glossary: IBM -  The first manufacturer of the ""PC"" platform and developer of many of the early standards. By the late 1980s IBM was just another PC manufacturer, but top end for corporate use. From then on Microsoft (developer of DOS and Windows)and Intel (maker of 8086 chips used in PCs) set the ""Wintel standards""  XT: An improvement of the first PC, still 8 bit 8086/8088, and where clones started to be made.  AT: Basically the fully 16 bit version of the XT, with other improvements, including support for hard drives and high density floppy disks/drives, and having a battery backed clock and settings RAM. Older ATs used a program to set the clock and settings (called CMOS), later ones had CMOS set up in BIOS.  MFM: Old HDD format. The controller card did a lot of the work of reading/writing data to the drive. IDE put most of the controller onto the drive itself.  An MFM drive has two ribbons, one control (which could support two or drives), and one data, per drive.  VGA: the standard through the 90s for the graphics connection."

Might be a faulty version check. The indexes do not seem to work properly. The index is a list of all driver packs, so you can download the index first and then only get the packs you need, but this never worked for me.   It accepts command line parameters:  @ECHO OFF FOR %%I IN (*.EXE) DO ( START """" %%I /checkupdates /autoupdate /port:23141 )   This will basically run all exe files with some arguments.

The tower is for the most part a 3DO, but with the ability to debug, run ""retail"" Eproms which look for DRM, or Dev Eproms which don't. the Dev ROMs at least let you load code/content through the highspeed optical link from the Mac.  The Mac is a Mac with a 3DO I (mostly just the pad) /O  (mostly just a TV or video monitor), as well as a processor upgrade for the 3DO software and dev environment."

retrobattlestations,2yx2yo,Urdnot_Vex,4,Fri Mar 13 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"As I said, just a guess. It might be regions or something, or DRM to allow only authorized software (similar to the primary purpose of the 10NES chip - keep crap software off the console)."
retrobattlestations,2yx2yo,classicsat,3,Fri Mar 13 22:16:42 2015 UTC,Now that could entirely be correct. I'm not familiar with how the system handled non-authorized software.
retrobattlestations,2yx2yo,Urdnot_Vex,2,Fri Mar 13 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"Close, the custom 3DO hardware cards are the DRM. It would have been prohibitively expensive to duplicate/reverse engineer those then.   The optical disks just hold data. Useless without the 3DO hardware to make them work."

The mechanism that moves the heads of all CD readers I've ever had the pleasure of taking apart are designed like this.  I think he is saying that there was a plastic part connecting this rod with the motor responsible for turning it and there was something wrong with this connector.

retrobattlestations,2ywh41,PrpleMnkyDshwsher,2,Fri Mar 13 19:54:55 2015 UTC,I've seen a double tracked one where the head would move a bit as if there was a spring pushing on it from underneath. Sort of like this design: http://cdn.instructables.com/FPL/NMBJ/GP7IGLDI/FPLNMBJGP7IGLDI.MEDIUM.jpg  I've never seen one without any track at all but I'm not an expert. Is it possible to see inside the chassis where the head is or is it all covered up?
retrobattlestations,2ywh41,boxjon,2,Fri Mar 13 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"I used to repair CD players for years. Things to know and things to test:  -The lens sits on a suspension which allows two voice coils to move the lens vertically upwards and downwards to focus, and for fine tracking inward and outward  -The optical head coarse tracking is driven by either a geared drivetrain or by a shaft with a screw pattern machined into it. If it's a screw, the optical head is likely using a spring-loaded ball bearing to contact the screw to drive it forward  -There is often an end-stop switch which the optical head will trigger when it seeks to the mechanical limit towards the spindle  -Track zero, and where the machine will attempt disc detection is closest to the spindle  What I would do is:  -Open the CD lid and manually grab the optical hend (the black square plastic thing, not the lens!) and manually slide it to about the centre of its travel. Close the lid, turn the machine on. Open the lid afterwards and make sure the head has moved itself towards the spindle. If it has, great. If it hasn't, you may have a coarse tracking problem.   -With the lid open and without a CD inside, press the little interlock switch which the machine uses to detect that the door is closed. You should see the lens move up and down as it tries to focus on a CD. If you don't see this, it's possible that the end-stop switch that tells the machine that the coarse tracking is in the track 0 position may have failed  -Clean the lens with a Q-tip, wetted with isopropyl alcohol. Be gentle.  -With a CD inserted, the lid open and the interlock switch pressed, spin the CD by hand. It's possible that it uses a DC spindle motor, which could be on its last legs. If you spin the CD by hand and it spins up, the motor bearings may be worn.  It's highly likely that during shipping, the optical head has slammed up against the outer edge of its course tracking and become jammed. Just grabbing onto it and pulling it into the centre of its travel will likely fix that. Old machines often had shipping screws installed into them to prevent this."

retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,ahandle,2,Thu Mar 12 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"If the Amiga scene hadn't been so forceful about Piracy, maybe things would be different."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,RickRussellTX,3,Tue Mar 17 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Aww, I thought it was going to be the original mold."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,Urdnot_Vex,2,Thu Mar 12 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"Neat, but doesn't do me any good since all I have are the original breadbox and a C128 :) (Unless I'm wrong and an original C64 keyboard/motherboard will fit)  Still, interesting project, especially for those folks who have cases that have gone yellow."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,bobmooney,4,Thu Mar 12 00:13:21 2015 UTC,"All I have is an original C64 as well.  Though I might be able to use this for an emulator, if I could find a keyboard for it."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,GreatNorthWeb,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Get a keyboard from a thrift store, print sticker sheet, and use an emulator.  Or buy a computer on eBay.  Cheap and plentiful."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,f15sim,3,Thu Mar 12 17:19:54 2015 UTC,The guts from a breadbox will fit in the 64C case. You only need 2 mounts for the keyboard and those can be 3D printed.
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,cbmuser,2,Thu Mar 12 02:03:22 2015 UTC,The guy mentions that there was a C128 case mold as well from where he got the C64c case.
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,Urdnot_Vex,2,Thu Mar 12 06:51:09 2015 UTC,"Man, if he offers a C128 one, I'm all over it. Mine is yellowed to hell."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,Grhmhome,2,Thu Mar 12 07:34:41 2015 UTC,"This would be cool if it had a keyboard already installed, or a easy way to add a keyboard inside.  I think I have a solution to this. You could possibly find a C64 keyboard online and buy an adapter that would allow you to connect your C64 keyboard to a PC. Put in a mini ITX or raspberry PI inside."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,JRDerpwing,2,Thu Mar 12 14:19:57 2015 UTC,mmm I'd Bubble Bobble that all day  and Retrograde in the night
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,MairusuPawa,4,Thu Mar 12 14:36:48 2015 UTC,Make that a Raspberry Pi case?
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,tahudswork,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"I saw this and though, ""oh yeah, that's what to do with my raspberry pi!""  I'm going to get a blue one I think and give it to my little brother, he'll dig the shit out of playing minecraft on a keyboard."
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,SuperConductiveRabbi,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"You're basically describing the C64X, but that was a Mini-ITX case instead. (Though it could easily fit an RPi, of course.)"
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,King_Corduroy,4,Thu Mar 12 04:39:25 2015 UTC,Yeah but even the barebones version of that was something like 300$ which is insane for a tiny computer case and a keyboard.
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,King_Corduroy,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:13:20 2015 UTC,Hmm I would be interested in this! My C64C is unevenly yellowed and has permanent shadows on it. lol
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,leandrotami,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:51:52 2015 UTC,Would love to have one but my country's crazy custom rules make it near impossible.
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,derfherdez,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:20:03 2015 UTC,Brazil?
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,leandrotami,3,Thu Mar 12 15:53:37 2015 UTC,Crazier. Argentina
retrobattlestations,2yqlz2,BlorfMonger,-1,Thu Mar 12 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"Nice, but nothing a can of plasti-dip cant do to your old case."
