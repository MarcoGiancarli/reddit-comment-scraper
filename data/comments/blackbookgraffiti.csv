blackbookgraffiti,3cnudo,flows_swe,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:47 2015 UTC,Thanks. Didn¬¥t really had an idea what to draw there :) The Idea was to have this huge clearing with the focus on the pyramid. And if i ever intend to colour it I could do nice lightning effects with this arrangement.
blackbookgraffiti,3cnudo,Lagerbottoms,4,Thu Jul 9 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"That Background is dope as fuck :D  The letters are cool too, but one big advice from me is about those rings you put around several letters. when you're still sketching everything in pencil, try to put the rings around AFTER you added 3D blocks to the letters. Currently it looks like the rings are part of the letters. If you put them around the whole letter with the block, you get a way better 3D impression. Cheers ;)  edit: another idea is, that you could draw all those blocks TOWARDS the pyramid. This would give it even more focus"

This is the result of one of them, didn't used it because it sounds kinda cheesy where i come from.   Back then, i wasn't yet into connections between letters for my quicker styles. Around 2008 i started focusing more on simpler thought out stuff. This enabled me to quickly bust out more consistent simple styles based on random letter combinations, like the simpler Heat sketch i did recently.  I'm thinking about posting some sketches from 1999/2000, which was the time of huge improvement towards stuff i still like, understanding how to construct letters with bars etc.. kinda leaving the toy shit behind i did before."

blackbookgraffiti,3b8trx,TheRobotMilitia,3,Fri Jun 26 22:19:40 2015 UTC,i'd use some more colors. different colored 3-d.. different colored cloud.  what you have going makes everything really flat.  your letters look ok.
blackbookgraffiti,3b8trx,AlexZander,2,Fri Jun 26 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm just getting started. I'm trying to get better markers but not sure which are best for beginners, any suggestions?"
blackbookgraffiti,3b8trx,AlexZander,3,Sat Jun 27 01:08:37 2015 UTC,"prismacolor and copics are two of the better brands. these are sketching alcohol based markers. they're not necessarily made for graffiti, they work the best on paper or something smooth like bristol board. Not really something for beginners, but they are probably the best. Promarkers are probably the best alternative to prismas. they are basically the same marker but at a cheaper price. if you want to get those details and blend colors or do any sort of fancy blackbook work these (prisma/copic/pro) are what you want to save for.  I also have a set of 24 pentel finepoint felt tip markers that work well. If i didn't already have the prismas I would use these. The set of 24 is a good color range and they're super cheap. If you can't swallow your pride and use crayola markers, I would get these for a beginner.  you can also use sharpies, but the tips wear out and get really fat, they bleed to shit and they're just OK... the chisel tips are nice though.  There are paint pens also.... molotow, montana, deco, uni..although I have all of them I don't really like to use them much. I find the nibs to be abrasive and eat up my paper with just a few pass overs.. not really a fan of paint pens. I need stronger paper."

I know the K don't jive with some people but i think it looks cool in this piece but /r/JuvenileDelinquent is a dope artist so his opinion is very valid.

blackbookgraffiti,3b09eg,Biff666Mitchell,2,Wed Jun 24 22:49:15 2015 UTC,U have alot of 3D in this piece. I would flip the script on this bitch with chunkier letters and less 3D in between. Would improve piece dramatically. This is just my opinion tho. Some people like this look with skinny letters and bulky 3D.
blackbookgraffiti,3avtiu,Saint613,4,Tue Jun 23 22:21:03 2015 UTC,Epic piece & character but I personally don't think the combination fit well together.
blackbookgraffiti,3avtiu,WoknRolla,2,Wed Jun 24 02:50:43 2015 UTC,I feel you.. The dragon was supposed to balance out the smoke on the right originally but I didn't like the look of just the head and I couldn't figure out a way to make it point towards the letters with fire easily ( kinda like this )
blackbookgraffiti,3avtiu,chromejunx,3,Wed Jun 24 05:28:45 2015 UTC,Maybe have it swoop down towards the word like its flying. Either way it's pretty rad.
blackbookgraffiti,3avtiu,chromejunx,2,Wed Jun 24 06:08:04 2015 UTC,Also maybe make your E more like the T. I just find the E a little wonky.
blackbookgraffiti,3avtiu,mirkogrocrop,2,Wed Jun 24 06:09:50 2015 UTC,Dont get me started on the E it just looked worse and worse to me the more I worked on the piece haha.. It was supposed to be lowercase but I inked it wrong  Thanks for the feedback

blackbookgraffiti,3atl3y,salke,2,Tue Jun 23 12:07:40 2015 UTC,looks cool. I think a bolder outline would make the letters stand out more. The outline makes the whole piece look flat.

blackbookgraffiti,3asubx,chairleg1,4,Tue Jun 23 06:00:06 2015 UTC,when starting out.... anything you can get your hand on.   There is no point in getting expensive pens/markers when you are just starting. honestly a mechanical pencil and a bic pen is my jam. when I first started I use to rack all sorts of art supplies. It just makes me laughing seeing all of my old stuff when I was just starting out using markers that were like 5-7$ each! seems like such a waste now. lol    But I will tell you some things I miss that I wish I still had.   deco paint pens I had a lot of fun with same with the sharpie oil based paint markers. super good for doing graffiti on people at partys and shit lol
blackbookgraffiti,3asubx,doomddo,2,Tue Jun 23 08:43:02 2015 UTC,"This, also check out /r/graffhelp and read through the sidebar. It's full of useful tutorials and whatnot for beginners."
blackbookgraffiti,3asubx,-Kato,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:37:41 2015 UTC,"Deco markers bring back some nostalgia for me, but I can't say I was ever a big fan. They always remained sticky after they dried, and if you had to rest your hand on paint you already put down, it would stick to your hand, and fuck up what ever you drew.   Montana markers are where it's at. Still rackable, and way better than Deco ever was."

Sure it's always cooler to draw with Sharpie, than a random pencil, but tools don't make the craftsman. Same thing with graffiti - you can buy a 100$ set of best markers, but it doesn't make you an artist."
blackbookgraffiti,3asubx,TrueKNite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:02:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other guys in that you don't really need to drop too much on pencils/pens when starting  My advice: for pencils whatever fits your hand best I've got two that I like that are relatively cheap Zebra M-301 .5 nice skinny, lightweight top click and a few that have a rubber grip and side mech, they're a little fatter on the grip  Sharpies are okay but I'm not a fan of the bleed, I love Pilot Fineliners. Cheap, last a long time good for thin lining and setting up a boundary that you can go back and use a sharpie over if you want"

blackbookgraffiti,39h3fg,Ryst1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:47:52 2015 UTC,Filling is mostly about technique. Prismas are my favorite but I use sharpies too. I have a whole mix of markers. You need to fill in the same pattern throughout the section and try not to overlap lines. Takes a bit of getting used to. What really makes it pop is the outline. I outline in sharpies and use pens to clean it up. Give the edges nice points with a finer tip. It really pulls it together.
blackbookgraffiti,39h3fg,poison_ivan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:32:08 2015 UTC,If you want acrylic paint pens just go for the Montanas. They are in almost every Michaels craft store. But I you want ink markers id go with cheap shit like crayola. Expensive markers don't make a better artist so don't waste your money using prisma or copics unless someone else is buying lol.

blackbookgraffiti,38pjm8,apomares23,0,Sat Jun 6 08:44:30 2015 UTC,"This is pretty good especially since I'm guessing your'e young and just starting out.  At the risk of coming off annoying or pretentious I'm going to give you some pointers because you have potential...  It's tilted. You can draw some lines across the wall before you do the sketch to keep it straight. Also, go back if you can and add a double outline. Trust me it will make it look a million times better. Right now it looks unfinished. Maybe a black double outline to keep the colors uniform. The little grey dots in the background take away from the cleanliness. I'm guessing it says Salke? The L,K and E are too close together and the L looks like a C. The K is horrible. The letters remind me of Kems and Ges but if you keep on sketching you'll eventually develop your own style. Last thing... The hand style... needs work. Don't neglect hand style practice.   That's it... If you do the double outline and fix the background post a pick!"

Before you start criticising on me, please show me some of your work.( i cant seem to find anything ) you are talking like you know everything and gives me pointers ( Dont get me wrong, i think its fine, just wanna see what the peoples work looks like before i get down to ""business"" ) . look at my other drawings, i feel more comfortable drawing my handstyle then painting it,, and i know the handstyle in this one is ugly."

Because R and K have the same structure, use that to your advantage. You can connect the back of your K to the leg of your R. Your P is your 1st impression, everything else builds off of that. When doing the spine of your P, instead of a straight line, give it a little crutch."
blackbookgraffiti,36k5yu,millsup,2,Tue May 19 23:58:54 2015 UTC,I love it...sketching graffiti while studying criminal law. Do you do sketchy graffiti spots?

blackbookgraffiti,36i99s,seloc,3,Tue May 19 16:34:47 2015 UTC,Thanks! Means a lot coming from you! It was basically just me trying to occupy myself for about 5x15 minutes today though

blackbookgraffiti,36i99s,ReamTeam513,2,Tue May 19 17:10:23 2015 UTC,Gotta agree that fill is killer man. Kind of reminds me of the front of a blackbook.
blackbookgraffiti,36i99s,liquisedx,1 point,Tue May 19 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah the fill is nice, but I think you got too many arrows...  And your bars are too unsteady."
blackbookgraffiti,36ismn,ANonWittyNewbie,4,Tue May 19 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"I would focus more on practicing simple letter structure before worrying about shit like bubbles. Your T and C are composed of purely straight edges, and the X doesn't have a single straight edge in it. Get your letter structure down before anything else. Just keep pencil sketching and practicing."

blackbookgraffiti,36ismn,chromejunx,1 point,Tue May 19 21:18:36 2015 UTC,I feel the blue bubbles killed it. Not sure how to save it.

blackbookgraffiti,36k00x,StonerInTraining,2,Tue May 19 23:12:50 2015 UTC,"Your arrows on the A don't come out of the bars, it looks like you just put them there. The C is too fat and cramped compared to the other letters. Some of the defining parts of the E are blocked by the C's arrows, thus making it look like an F. Go to /r/graffhelp , check out the side bar and try to stay away from any complicated stuff."
