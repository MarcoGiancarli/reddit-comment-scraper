nl_Kripparrian,3e2cu6,WookieHarrelson,16,Tue Jul 21 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"I know this is supposed to be a joke, but in the article they commited a pretty huge fallacy. They concluded from the study (or that's how they worded it anyway) that: performs bad at the game ---> sexist and then they say: sexist----->bad at the game.  To clarify, if A implies B, doesn't mean B implies A.  I don't think this article can be taken seriously."
nl_Kripparrian,3e2cu6,TheMentallord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"This isn't my field, and I don't feel like spending more than 10 minutes on it anyway, but the actual research implies the former, that when you are a low performer you are more likely to verbally attack women because you perceive them as a social threat.  Not to say I agree with this 100%, but here's the discussion from their paper.   Our results support an evolutionary argument for why low-status, low-performing males are hostile towards female competitors. Dominance is tightly linked to fitness in men as studies from hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate that dominance rank increases fitness through offspring number and resource availability. Even in modern day society, dominance and not attractiveness is associated with college male mating success. Low-status and low-performing males have the most to lose as a consequence of the hierarchical reconfiguration due to the entry of a competitive woman. As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female’s performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank. This idea is reinforced by the fact that higher-skilled males that should not feel threatened by a female increased their number of positive comments.  Apart from restructuring the hierarchy, a high status female poses a secondary threat to relatively lower status males: as women are attracted to dominance, a high-status female is less likely to find lower-status males attractive. We argue that a secondary benefit of increased female-directed hostility is that it simultaneously decreases a female’s confidence and perception of her self-worth (i.e. negging) while simultaneously increasing the perception of him being a dominant (i.e. socially valuable) mate. Higher-skilled (i.e. more dominant) males do not behave in this manner as there is no need for them to reinforce their dominance to maintain their attractiveness. Although there is no direct evidence in the literature that negative behaviour towards females increases a male’s mating opportunity, our results provide an interesting testable hypothesis requiring further investigation."

nl_Kripparrian,3e2cu6,__Saga__,4,Tue Jul 21 12:39:03 2015 UTC,"Did you even read the paper? It says men issued sexist statements (11 out of 82 players..lol) when a female player of lower trueskill dies, but there are less negative comments towards females when their trueskill is higher from high skilled male players. Then comparing it to status in real life e.g. Unsuccessful males hate successful females, be it with jobs or partners. Which is obviously pure conjecture and anecdotal. Another thing about the study is that it does not mention age anywhere, it literally assumes everyone is a 20 year old male. Last time I played Halo 3, it was riddled with 12 year olds whose balls didn't drop yet.   And am I blind or did it not mention the amount of hostile comments there were towards males?   This is not to say that women did not play, just that they did not speak. This does, however, reinforce the fact that women are entering a very male dominated environment.   lmao  There is literally no parallels to draw from the paper (a hypothesis at that) into this subreddit. Judging by the article title, the author didn't read it either, but of course with an author at the Washington Post, facts don't matter; agenda does.  People shitpost about Rania on this subreddit for two reasons. 1. They think they will get a rise out of her. and 2. They are under the illusion that she is responsible for making their beloved Kripp what he is now.

Personally, I love DotA, but I hate having to always do what other people have written in their guide, so I play the less-serious version of it; Legends of DotA  Honestly, if Kripp is ever interested in DotA, I think that's a good starting point. I played solely that mode from 2009 to 2010, absolutely nolifing it, and never got tired of it an inch! I suppose it's kind of like Arena that you get to choose your own build and playstyle from a set number of randomized heroes, instead of having to pick and counterpick like it was DotA(or according to the meta in HS).

nl_Kripparrian,3dydnk,Shapop,4,Tue Jul 21 05:01:13 2015 UTC,i dont think you need to be rank 1 legend to cast HS. Kripp has more than enough knowledge to be a solid caster. The only thing id like Kripp to improve on is: hes used to always being right and it comes off in his casting where he will state things like a fact (and sometimes contradict or dismiss other casters while doing it ) when he is mistaken or it is not a fact. He needs to accommodate his casting partners more and not be so firm with his insight to where it feels like he's talking down to them. this creates somewhat of an awkward tension between the casters and thats when things like Monk calling him out can occur and can be somewhat cringeworthy for the viewer. but all these HS commentators are amateurs and all are learning on the job. everyone gives Frodan credit but hes just the best at faking it to make it (so to speak). if you actually break down what he says sometimes it makes no sense. hes just the best at filling in airtime with shit that sounds correct. kripp will get better with practice and maybe thats why he keeps going? that could be a future revenue source if HS esports ever gets huge and he wants to take a break from streaming/youtubes.

He avoids this by playing arena most of the time where half of the games are against casuals/noobs/bad decks, by having a high winrate there it it makes him feel superior to others, and by blaming every loss to RNG there's no accountability for his own mistakes. When he is on ladder its ""fun"" decks so he can say 'I wasnt playing a real deck anyway' when he loses, or ""I can't believe I won with THAT deck!' when he wins.  Basically.. everything he does in gaming is to feed his own ego and the idea that he's smarter and better than everyone else (which he isn't).

He was also known for exploiting and abusing WoW every chance he got, most of his achievements are tainted by that.  look at the vids of him PvPing in MoP with Hunter.. sitting there doing nothing and trolling them while his friend heals and then killing them in 5 seconds with pre-nerf cooldowns. ""Gladiator"" worthy skill."

nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,CursedLlama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why he tends to gravitate towards PvE games. He never played PvP in WoW, because it made him feel inferior at the game.  Arena is PvP, but with so much RNG involved he has easy excuses for his losses. Over the long haul in constructed, he has no excuses."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,catheterjoy,0,Mon Jul 20 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"He never played PvP in WoW, because it made him feel inferior at the game.   Except when he got glad."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,CursedLlama,2,Mon Jul 20 18:04:20 2015 UTC,"Kripp always brings up the days when he was a hardcore PvP'er back in Dark Age and how he loved PvP'ing and how good he was at it. I don't think anyone that knows Kripp these days knew about him in DAoC, nor does anyone care.   All I know of Kripp's PvP'ing skills are from when I played with him in Guild Wars 2 World vs World PvP. He was really bad at PvP'ing for the first few days, but improved a lot when I taught him how to WvW and play the Ranger class. Then again, he usually ran around with a huge zerg in WvW, so it didn't show how good he really was at PvP'ing.   Neverwinter also had awesome PvP. However, Kripp never touched Neverwinter's PvP. He stayed PvE'ing the entire time he played that game.  You're right though. Kripp usually sticks with PvE in the games he plays, even back in his hardcore days. It's so sad to see a gamer once well-known and proud of his gaming credentials and owning people both in PvE and PvP, now turn into a complete scrub who's afraid to play against tough competition in a friggin' card game."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,C_L_I_C_K,12,Tue Jul 21 08:33:11 2015 UTC,"You don't even necessarily need to play a netdeck to reach Legend. People reach legend with all sorts of homemade decks. Brian Kibler reached legend by playing Dragon Paladin and Dragon Paladin was never actually a thing.  Kripp should just take one deck that he loves, and play constructed every day in a month until he reaches legend. I think the perfect deck for this would be his very own Holy Wrath Paladin. It's a cool fun deck and he's the only person I know who plays it."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,Gatesleeper,11,Sun Jul 19 16:19:01 2015 UTC,Kibler is actually really good though
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,upgradenoob2323,2,Sun Jul 19 23:33:15 2015 UTC,"Kripp doesn't compare to Kibler, not in the least.  Kripp playing Holy Wrath Paladin around rank 10 is not the same as playing it at rank 2."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,catheterjoy,4,Mon Jul 20 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't even take THAT long. Hotform hit legend in like 4 days this month. He had been fucking around on crazy decks on EU last few days.  Shit, he will probably get legend on EU just screwing around!  Kripp needs to man up and get that card back!"
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,me3260,16,Sun Jul 19 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"He is been playing HS for so long now. I can't even understand why he doesn't sacrifice a season to get Legend. In the past when he needed an hunter pet or he had to farm goblins in D3 for a goal or w/e, he never backed up from a tedious grind. Now he is just a casual pussy about the ""getting Legend just once"" issue.  He might be afraid he will get burned/be done with HS like he did with POE/D3 if he does that. I know this happend to Krippi, Alkaizer and Moldran. They just couldn't be arsed to get Legend again after they did it once. I think Moldran did it twice."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,RawerPower,11,Sun Jul 19 08:45:10 2015 UTC,"Nobody wants him to do it more than once.  I think he's legitimately scared that he might not be able to do it, and that will destroy his reputation.  Until he gets his legend card back, he's a faggot pussy."
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,RushyRush,2,Sun Jul 19 09:07:26 2015 UTC,Which is funny because even non-HS-pro casters like Reckful and Frodan do it almost every season. Reckful did it in the first week this month.

nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,MileyCyrus8,-12,Sun Jul 19 09:57:47 2015 UTC,He's already stated that the reason he won't do it is because of the lack of rewards for doing so.  He doesn't want to spend weeks grinding for it one season only for the rewards to get ramped up the next season and have to do it all over again.  That and he generally doesn't enjoy constructed all that much.

If you think hearthstone is an e-sport that requires supreme skill and intellect then I've got news for you.  And this is coming from someone who loves Hearthstone.     Now he is just a casual pussy    You're complaining that someone playing a casual game isn't casual enough to get Legend.  Wtf is wrong with you.  That's not a question.  I just want you to think about what may be wrong with your head."

I dont want to grind Legend is easy to get to Its just netdecks   And then resumes the (now 5 hour) hearthstone day of playing Arena and rank 20 games. Its nothing about complaining, more commentating on something kripp said"
nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,Seriouscatt,3,Sun Jul 19 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"It's more like deep down he's afraid he'll fail, and look shitty in front of viewers. Can't hurt that pride you know.

nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,Mardoo,3,Sun Jul 19 07:18:48 2015 UTC,So constructed is more RNG than a format where you can't decide the cards in your deck?

It's not hardcore, it's not an esport, it's just a stupid cardgame which is very simplistic and casual.  I mean seriously, netdecking is all people do, you can't build a deck like in real cardgames.

nl_Kripparrian,3dtaks,Mardoo,-4,Mon Jul 20 06:24:56 2015 UTC,"here we go again. the grind to legend is boring. it would probably take a whole month. he rather play arena where the decks are more interesting than face hunter and demon zoo. it is no fun to go up against a deck, know basically 28/30 cards and lose because you didn't draw your board clear when the opponent goes yolo face.  in arena it actually takes thought to figure out what your opponent actually has.  I agree with kripp. any mindless idiot can get legend when you see how those with the card back make horrible plays."

nl_Kripparrian,3dr5w9,Starslinger,5,Sat Jul 18 21:26:14 2015 UTC,You know I hate to be a pessimistic fuck but I have 2 family friends who's 2 sons were fleeced by chicks they met in online relationships. 1 girl from Cuba another from China. Both gone once they got into canada after a few months both 'in school' as an excuse to why they werent home all the time. So if anyone one wonders why people question Rania so much its because they care about Kripp and have probably seen it happen so they care more than the typical person. Im not interested trying to help kripp because quite frankly I dont know Rania. It just screams to me as 'user' and is the reason she gets hate even if 100% legit.
nl_Kripparrian,3dr5w9,RushyRush,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:54:00 2015 UTC,I've not seen much to suggest she wasn't quite calculated in contacting Kripp.

If you want to circlejerk eachother with snuggles then fucking go to one of the 9000 over streamers who keeps bullshitting with their ""Oh this is THE BEST community ever!

It takes a real dumb fuck to think any of this is criticism. It's just an opinion but that's hard for a lot of you to tell apart because ""it's the internet"" so whatever your dumb ass comes up with it's automaticaly true.

nl_Kripparrian,3dlle0,Crooked2g,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"WoW requires much more time and grinding than D3 or PoE to get i to a decent level and gear up.   Not anymore, which is why I think so many people like me have quit.  Just log on for 2 nights a week for a few hours to raid and never touch the game elsewise.  Back in the day when you could spend all your day, every day on WoW, that was the best.  Game just has nothing to do anymore except raid.  You and Kripp could boost to 90, and hit 100 in 10 hours (Kripp almost certainly has enough gold to outfit you both with full heirloom and crafted gear), and then get carried through H HFC and have a decent set of gear in less than 20 hours played, if RNGesus is on your side with drops."

nl_Kripparrian,3dn1t7,cluntash,7,Fri Jul 17 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"I understand the idea, and agree that ignoring bullies removes their strength. But sometimes ignoring the issue only means this behaviour isn't challenged.   Also, I hope every time Kripp or Rania read a positive response or word of encouragement, it shows them that the hate is a small (but vocal) minority, and that humanity isn't as doomed as it may appear."
nl_Kripparrian,3dn1t7,cluntash,0,Fri Jul 17 16:53:06 2015 UTC,I just feel like challenging them is encouraging them and they thrive off of attention. You aren't doing anyone favours giving them attention. They aren't going to keep shit posting if no one replies to them.   Also you can encourage Kripp and Raina by leaving completely separate posts instead of giving hate posts attention.
nl_Kripparrian,3dn1t7,claymore93,0,Fri Jul 17 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"I agree in some ways here, and disagree in others. If I am honest, I am never sure of the best approach.   Half of me completely agrees with everything you say.  The other half thinks, ""but if nobody ever challenges them, how can we ever change things?""  Think about this: if just 1 in 100 trolls read a response and they thought, ""maybe he's right, maybe I should change my behaviour"" then there's a difference. Right there.  And think about all the big changes in recent history: women's suffrage, civil rights, feminism, gay rights, etc. All these things emerged from people standing up to the bullshit.   But, as I said in the beginning, maybe you're right."
nl_Kripparrian,3dn1t7,Seriouscatt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's hard to say for sure. I think it helps to ask yourself what are people really trying to accomplish by posting hate comments. So if you know what they are trying to achieve by posting that stuff (most likely attention) that it gives you a prime opportunity to deprive them of what they are trying to acquire. Responding is no different from feeding the trolls which is an age long rule that no one follows still to this day despite its effectiveness. Not sure about the whole civil rights example and how that relates to this but yeah, it's hard to be sure."

Do you think Kripp is so weak of mind that she can make him do whatever he wants?  Just because he's with Rania while his stream is changing doesn't mean she's the cause of it. Correlation does not equal causation.     nobody is mad that he got a girlfriend and more of a life   But that's how they're acting.  They're complaining that he's not ""no life"" anymore.  They want him to be single or at the very least have him never acknowledge he has a life outside of video gaming.  It's all very selfish.  Kripp finds a girl who 1000% supports and encourages his gaming hobby and people are saying he's not allowed to do fun stuff on stream with her?  Huh?  That's incredibly selfish.

nl_Kripparrian,3dj4ux,Que-Hegan,25,Thu Jul 16 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what ""turning into a massive pussy"" in regards to being vegan means.   No, cooking for someone that's vegan is not hard. In fact, most vegetable dishes are easier to cook than meat dishes. Going to the grocery store is a little more time consuming because we usually check ingredients for more products than before, but still easy because there are quite a few options.   The only small difficulty is when visiting countries that traditionally don't have a cuisine that offers a lot of vegetarian / vegan options, or countries that it's a little hard to communicate what a vegan is, but we still made it. :)"

Now he's 27 or 28 right? He has responsibilities. The no life gimmick was unsustainable, and you should be able to see that. I love that someone that seems to be so nice and humble found a girl to be his better half. Why is that such a bad thing?   I still like his stream, and I still like him. Of course it isn't the same as before, but how could it be? Just my two cents man. You come off as so negative that it's hard to even take what you're saying seriously.   Kripp and Rania are both really nice people. It's as simple as that to me. Saying I demand the stream be like it was in 2010 is really selfish....and blaming Rania for Kripp ""becoming casual"" is just really immature and myopic. It's not white knighting when people are saying incredibly hurtful stuff towards her and Kripp, and you try to defend them - it's being a decent human being.  And why are you calling her a bitch? I mean what has she done that would make you think that? You're the one that sounds like a whiny bitch."

Generally we like to offer electroshock therapy, which is painful and leads to incontinence and erectile dysfunction, but I presume these won't be issues for you.

nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,Oozesnoozelose,9,Tue Jul 14 16:15:26 2015 UTC,This subreddit seems really two sided.
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,MileyCyrus8,6,Tue Jul 14 16:17:19 2015 UTC,it really has been super two sided lately
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,Moggelol,-7,Tue Jul 14 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"it is, it's PoE vs Moneystone"
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,__Saga__,12,Tue Jul 14 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"Twelve year olds (I hope) are just cannot get over the fact that Kripp is not ever going back to his old hardcore self. He will be streaming Hearthstone for two years straight on August, yet people still cannot grasp the concept that he is never going back. This will be the majority of his time as a streamer dedicated to Hearthstone. I mean fuck, I got over it the day he went to Greece  People are lashing out at Rania by saying completely asinine and malicious things about her because they feel that she is responsible for Kripp's stream going completely casual and generic, which of course is undeserving. Kripp is an adult, he makes decisions by his own volition. Kripp was casual long before he moved in with Rania, he played HS from August '13, then played non stop until Blizzcon which was November(?) and then moved to Greece in March or some shit. See my point? Rania had zero influence on Kripp's descent, as he was long gone before Greece. All hate on her is unjustifiable.  BUT  I will say this, I can see why people don't respect Kripp anymore. As HE is the one that did a complete 180 on his channel from the start, and people don't like that so I can understand it, but personal insults aren't necessary."
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,TheMentallord,2,Tue Jul 14 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Lets be real. I think the Rania hate is pretty dumb and stupid BUT you can't deny her influence on him. When he makes a decision, it has Rania's influence for sure. It's pretty normal, since they are a couple. It's how the world works."

If youre that curious about it just read the threads here on this first page and make up your own opinion about the situation instead of making a new thread about it"

Some people are actually intelligent and don't suck on Kripp's dick like you. Some people wants Kripp to actually think for himself like he used to, instead of being pussy whipped by Rania and blinded by his greed for money. Some people can't stand watching someone who's a huge hypocrite.  Most of these people already gave up on Kripp and moved on. The ones that remain now are whiteknights like yourself and other casual Kripp fans who didn't know what he stood for and how he was before Hearthstone."

The Cardstone folk wont ever get it, but the Kripp you see today is quite literally the very thing hardcore Kripp and his mumble buddies used to make fun of. This is not an exaggeration, it's actually kinda scary how perfectly he now lives up to those things.  I mean, this is the guy who once made a video about how he didnt like donations. DONATIONS."
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,cluntash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:56 2015 UTC,Do you have any videos of him acting like he did? I really wanna see the difference for myself.
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,Que-Hegan,5,Tue Jul 14 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"Well you can just scour through his older youtube vids but i'll link a few.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9HrmtoU7nY Kripp's 'giveaway'   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV9WBL5EmTg $300 hamburger, 6:00 for donate part  But for the most part its just casual talk during his old streams. For example, he once called out Trump for doing this weird cookie donating thing on stream(friggin weird stuff, donate and you get a cookie or something), things like that.  Again, i'm not saying its good or bad, it's just interesting to see. Maybe he was just short-sighted about real life back then. Maybe this is all a facade. Or maybe potato's. Who knows."
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,cluntash,5,Tue Jul 14 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"Or, like all of us, he's grown up and thinks about the future more. I know I do.

nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,Que-Hegan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:04:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but thats the point people are trying to make here. He used to be in it purely for the gaming aspect, which was honestly rather unique as a (known) streamer. Now it's for the money. Which is pretty normal in its own right, but i dont see why people keep denying it and trying to sugarcoat it. It's like trying to say Fifa is in it for the game and not the money."
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,KrippSuperFan,0,Wed Jul 15 19:24:16 2015 UTC,Thanks. He seemed much more moody back then. And I saw the Trump video which I thought was strange since he sorta din the same thing. Thanks for the links!
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,Kawaiimachine,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:58:19 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, people are allowed to change their mind. Kripp's stream is nowhere near selling out. You want to see a sell out? Go watch a girl streamer with around 1,000 viewers. You'll get to see people sell out before they even get started.  Maybe ad revenues have dropped in the last few years. Maybe Twitch is slow to pay streamers. There are a million reasons why Kripp should diversify his revenue, ya know, like a business should."
nl_Kripparrian,3d9jh4,FutureStrongman,0,Tue Jul 14 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can look at it that way. Or you can look at it like Kripp adopting a new personality to earn more money. Which, to me at least, honestly makes more sense. And it's actually a very legitimate and normal thing to do as a streamer. There is not a single streamer out there that i can think off that doesnt put up some sort of role when they stream. Maybe Trump, but you never know with Trump if it's an act or if he's really THAT awkward."

But blaming it all on Rania is just so.....childish. Really. Kripp is what, 27/28 now? He's an adult, a man who who makes his own decisions and fully understands their consequences. Acting like Rania mind-controlled him into doing all these things is nonsense. Yes she has a measure of influence into what he does, every girlfriend does, it's normal. But in the end it's Kripp who makes these calls, not Rania. Kripp. And that's what people dont seem to want to accept for some reason. You really think Kripp is some manchild who would cut off his own dong if Rania asked him to? You guys really think THAT lowly of Kripp?

He's the complete opposite of what made him famous and popular. I hope someday he realizes that ditching and shunning everyone who made him what he is was a mistake. I doubt he'll ever care though.

On a good day. Kripp is now a huge internet celebrity, and it makes sense that he's going to these events because he is actually invited to them.. He would always comment on ""how blizzard hated him and never invited / added him on things""   Kripp hasn't ""changed"". Kripp has always been the brunt, somewhat rude remarked guy that he always has been. My question to everyone that says he's changed is  how... He just plays hearthstone. He pretty much always ignored chat even when he first started streaming. He always was very guarded about his personal life which unfortunately people seem to be wanting to leak into. He never advertised donations. He always thanked subs, but now he just does his ""brofist"" thing which is hardly selling out.   I'm not saying your point is invalid, but provide something other than ""rania is draining him of his soul and money because we hate her voice on stream""."
nl_Kripparrian,3d3zum,Shyt-Just-Got-Real,-5,Mon Jul 13 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"If you're saying he hasnt changed, then you must have just started watching since he started playing HS full time.   My question to everyone that says he's changed is how... He just plays hearthstone   you answered your own question. He just plays hearthstone.. it didn't used to be that way, he would play WoW or PoE for extended periods of time, now he has to beg Rania for a few days away from the HS schedule to play other games, and then its right back to the grind.  You can tell he's totally bored with it and is just doing it for money, this is not how he used to be, and if he wasn't with her you know he would feel more freedom to play other games like it used to be.   So, as a viewer it's undeniable that the quality of stream has declined since they got together, and that's not even getting into the Sellout aspects like sponsors, joining a team, brofists, etc. Those are all things that she probably encouraged him to do to make more money from his stream, things he even mocked other streamers about in the past.

nl_Kripparrian,3d3zum,Snipawolfe,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"How's having a sponsor or joining a team selling out? He competes once in a while (and casts many competitions) so it's only natural that he's part of a team/in the scene and advertising is what streaming is all about when it becomes your job. Sponsors are advertisements you aren't even forced to watch, he just talks about them once in a while and has links under the stream.  If you think this is ""selling out"" go watch some League of Legends female streamers and compare their treatment of the game they're playing to how Kripp treats his games. He's serious as hell even if he looks apathetic. He still respects the games he's playing and most of the time does his best. He doesn't whine unnecessarily to give off a fake persona. He doesn't have an Amazon wishlist or shout out every donator as ""the biggest D of the day"" or go ""oh my Goood you're so sweet thank youuuu for subbing <3"" every time someone subs. He does a brofist to interact with his viewers and he also reads chat sometimes. That's all.  Go find a real sellout and it'd make your head spin."

Even though he might say he does - its easy to see he is bored with it. He doesn't competitively play HS due to the fear of being critised from failure, he doesn't get Legendary because ""It's too much of a grind"" but will play Tavern Brawl, Arena and that he came from a background of grindy games.

Kripp stopped playing D3 at a pretty high point in the game's views, to get even less views on another game, it's obvious that his statement about playing games he just enjoys, is pretty true. It's pretty doubtful that ""Any game Kripp  plays now"", will  have Rania. It kinda just sounds like they're having lovey-couple-fun-time together. I want to see old Kripp too, but he's a grown adult. I'd assume if he wanted a different life-style, he'd do it instead."

Now that you're subsisting solely off Kripp you have nothing better to do with your time. You're probably so bored that you're begging him to play games with you.  The last year doesn't matter. What matters is what's happening now. Kripp only mentions non-Hearthstone games in relation to playing them with you. Fact. That's what matters. That you will continue to be a large focus of his stream, especially when he's not playing Hearthstone.  Why don't you try to find a life for yourself? Find some Greek friends? Go to Weight Watchers in the evenings? Maybe the all-night schedule isn't working out. Eventually he is going to get sick of you. You're glued to him 24/7. You've had relationships.

A lot of the reason I am here is dealt with before I can get to it due to my schedule between work and sleep. Again, I am more than willing to post the mod logs of my actions. If anyone asks I will do it, otherwise, that's your problem.  The way I told leifman over Skype and Twitch before removing and ignoring him, is that, I would rather be called a white knight, and do the right thing, than fit in with the crowd and attack (in any form) someone. People are too caught on the fact that it's the internet. People think that because it is the internet, that the anonymity makes it ok to harass, or attack people without any sort of repercussion. In reality, it's not ok. Some people have different ways of handling it. Me? I couldn't care less what a hive mind thinks about me, because it is just that, a hive mind. 90% of the people who shit post in this subreddit all think the same thing because they want to be cool, to fit in.  The internet is so accustomed to acting any way they want to because they are anonymous. Shitty behavior won't change unless the people change, and because the majority of people who shit post refuse to grow up, here we are.

FINE, now since u called it ""blackmail"" (even tho i actually was trying not to post it in ur best interest really.. without expecting anything in return or demanding in return for it, which is by definition what a blackmail would be)  HERE is your look on how ""stds"" mind really works and how much of a complete insane mofo he is :  http://imgur.com/a/kl8m2  and i will explain what you are seeing :  first 2 pictures are of me sending him (stds) a quote from some reddit post he wrote which i felt like was too ""goody too shoes"" and i copied it to him and told him he is a white knight (actually half jokingly because at that point i regarded him as somewhat of a ""friend"", well u know what i mean.. by someone u have on skype and actually added him for a reason and u would talk to him on good terms yada yada)  what i got in response? mister hyde. (as you can see from picture #2 in that skype convo)  to which in the end he ""removed me from skype"" (OH NO... what would i do, i was the one that added him to skype to initially give him mumble access and recommend to mod him on kripps and stuff, FUCK i totally needed him on skype for my own benefits.)  actually after he removed me from skype i was done with it(second picture was the complete and uncensored convo, i did not ""edit"" it or put anything out of context) and i removed him myself and thought to myself ""boy what an idiot.. how the fuck did i even associate with him"" but then i received a ""twitch whisper"" when i was in some other stream and that's picture #3 and what u will see ahead...  again ill start by saying this is not ""filtered"" in any way, i did not remove/take out of re-arrange the order of the whispers or anything alike but i simply just cut out the actual twitch chat messages/talk that were in some room that has nothing to do with kripp or anything to do whispers he sent me and i replied to.  oh yeah about those ""whispers"" do note that at some point i am accused of actually, and ill quote : ""making fun, calling names and disrespecting"" rania.  now where the hell did i do that? i made it clear i don't like her, but i never in any way of form (reddit/twitch) disrespected her, called her names or made fun of her.  oh and to close it off, as u can see how mature ""stds"" is by actually initiating this ""whispering"" to me and being all ""mature"" and ""polite"" as he is on reddit with me... he actually ""disabled whispers"" so that my last whisper didn't even arrive back to him which is just so freaking LOL."

I don't want the fans and you to be divided. All I want is the Kripp stream to stay the same as its been. I didn't mind Hearthstone when it came around and I quite enjoy it sometimes, but I really loved the PoE/D3/WoW streams, and I just wish now that you are playing PoE again, you can at least play some hardcore and maybe talk to the mumble bros, like the old days.

He's not power tripping, he's not narcissistic, he's doing what he thinks is right. Some of the stuff targeted at Rania (and Kripp) isn't just trolling. It's personal, hurtful attacks which 1) have nothing to do with gaming, and 2) arent acceptable in any society.   As for Rania, anyone with a brain is going to defend her right now. The vitriol lately is disgusting. While I agree (sorry!) that Kripp should be playing games by himself, the personal attacks against her are outrageous. SHE MAKES KRIPP HAPPY. If you like Kripp, you should like that he's happy.   Please listen to me guys. I jumped to conclusions about this last week and I was wrong. I can't say anything else, but please, just trust Kripps judgment. Also about the new moderation, it's been fine. I hate OhBot more than any of the new mods lol. Kripp hasn't led you astray in almost a decade now. Show some faith. A part of anyone's life and maturation is worrying about the future. There's nothing wrong with putting yourself in a position to take care of that future. That is the real world. It's not selling out, its not brofisting, it's being a responsible partner in a relationship. It's also being a responsible son to a Dad and a family.   You know, I used to think real Kripp fans just hated hearthstone, but now I'm wondering how many real Kripp fans are left. I dont know about you guys, but I've been watching him for six+ years. Enough time for me to care about the person behind the stream. Everyone needs to chill the hell out.  I mean what have we become? is this subreddit indicative of all Kripp fans? I sure hope not."

She can go build her own stage if she needs one that badly.  Since when does ""creating a future for yourself"" mean gaming with Rania for three days (maybe more)?

I guess I'm speaking for him, but dude, this is a guy that never owned a car, cut his own hair to save money, etc. It's NOT ABOUT THE MONEY. It's about being happy. I don't know what else to say except he's earned the right to do what he wants to be happy, he's poured his soul into Youtube and Twitch since what, 2009? Do you want him up on the cross too?  edit: You're so caught up on the idea that she's ""using kripp"" to create her own platform for streaming. Maybe its more simple than that?

Granted I rarely spoke, it was also hard to get a word in over Cybrix or some of the others who...spoke a lot. The first couple Mors / Cybrix ordeals might have seemed funny but it quickly got old. And when Kripp basically left PoE, stopped doing community events in Savage 2, and went full time Hearthstone...I just left. His channel growth became way to big to moderate in chat and Kripp likes the chaos of his room, which is fine but it became no longer fun to hang in Mumble, or continue subscribing.

nl_Kripparrian,3cwzty,RawerPower,-3,Sat Jul 11 19:19:03 2015 UTC,We will never know the true reasons. He has been leaving people behind since before he moved to Greece. If I dig in my memory there have been moments like these since the times of the WoW guilds or GW2/D3.
nl_Kripparrian,3cwzty,foddon,3,Sat Jul 11 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"He just said the reason, what do you mean we'll never know?  As far as leaving people behind, that's just his personality -- if he's not actively playing games with someone he doesn't have much desire to reach out to them.  I'm pretty sure he even said at one point he hadn't talked to his family in months after moving to Greece so it's not exclusive to gaming buddies.  I've known a fair amount of people who are the same way so it's certainly not something unique to Kripp and there certainly doesn't have to be secret alternative motives."

This was due to a lot of things, whether that be personal life or personality clashing. In the end, we were being a bit unfair with Kripp with how much hate we enjoyed laughing at and repeating to the community. He was clearly not comfortable with it, even if he ""Laughed"" at it.  I stand by Kripp's decision to not rejoin mumble.

I simply went onto the mumble and talked to Kripp. I made jokes that made him laugh, some that didn't. I never spammed him, talked trash about him, or said anything to him that would cause him to feel uncomfortable, apart from when I got mad at Argus.  So please, downvote me for giving you the answer I saw from my point of view.

He said on stream that people could scold him if he ever dies even when on softcore or something along those lines, but it's still not the same thing. Perhaps it's just because Rania is so new and PoE is way more advanced and harder than diablo 3."
nl_Kripparrian,3csnzx,HufferNudes,3,Fri Jul 10 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think there are a lot of HS fans who would enjoy watching PoE if Kripp were to play on hardcore. The possibility of him dying and losing all progress is something that more than just PoE fans would enjoy watching.  There's also the fact that one of biggest features of this patch is the rewritten netcode which essentially eliminates desync, which was the main reason many people (including Kripp) were hesitant to play on hardcore."
nl_Kripparrian,3csnzx,Huffy778,6,Fri Jul 10 21:48:54 2015 UTC,Watching him play Darkest Dungeon was nice. I had something to think about compared to Hearthstone.

He can play it casually or hardcore it doesn't matter to me but as long as he plays at a pace he likes and doesn't spoil himself too much on the game by looking at the chat or looking at the wiki (Darkest Dungeon). Ultimately as long as he plays a new game he can really get into for a week and actually enjoys it then I can enjoy watching him play it.
nl_Kripparrian,3csnzx,Psuedonymous,5,Fri Jul 10 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"I would prefer PoE solo, but as far as Rania being involved in the stream I see no reason why she can't be in more HS streams.

nl_Kripparrian,3craxl,ADCPlease,2,Fri Jul 10 10:20:23 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Kripp's casting and it brought me back to the subreddit and the twitch channel after a fairly long hiatus. The argument that Kripp thinks himself better than others is baseless. He has an above average respect for casters that don't necessarily deserve it. For example: Listening to a streamer with an agenda like Frodan was frustrating because conversations couldn't flow naturally. I get that there's a certain respect you want to show to a caster who wants to delve into his latest scoop or drama when the time is convenient to him, but it hampers dialogue flow. In the reporting and news world, a scoop and its exclusivity is guaranteed by you being the only one with the knowledge OR being the first to print. If someone jumps your story because you had a casting gig before hand, sucks for you. That's my very minor bone to pick with Frodan and goes to show Kripp's professional courtesy. Furthermore, Kripp had great synergy with RDU that enriched the match commentary. RDU has great energy and a smile that could win us over in our grumpiest of moods--admit it. My only issue with RDU is his telescoping focus on the micro. He will begin to talk about an intensely specific element of a very specific match up and not bother placing it in the big picture. This is where Kripp came in. His accurate commentary was often nuanced with comedic diatribes that bridged RDU's tunnel vision into a bigger picture for the viewers. Without Kripp, Frodan's monotonous depression would have overtaken the cast. It was perfect for RDU as it complimented his winning qualities and made for a happy and energetic ""paladeen"". Again, Kripp was a great support for StrifeCro's appearance. I remember StrifeCro's earlier group streams (YouTube value town 19, I can't link--I'm on a plane.) I adore Strife, but he needed work on his cues for pauses and breaks. It was not unlike being a kid again and excited by all the information you're taking in but struggling not to be distracted or fall asleep. Even on great sleep and unreasonable amounts meth, we all need a break during the Strife monologue and it's because what he says is so good! We want to exclaim our agreement or share a follow up idea, perhaps even a counter-argument (yeah right). But there's no room to do it and we end up holding and waiting for a moment that never comes. Not unlike this run-on paragraph annnnnnnnd BREAK! He's gotten better. It's true. When he needed a little help on it here and there, Kripp was there to be bold and cut in when it was warranted and let Strife do his thang when needed. When Strife was being an oddball, Kripp was there to say things like ""did you prep vanish?"" to make it smooth and seamless. He was the perfect bro and it felt like the two had a friendship or at least a very healthy respect for each other off the air. It was pleasant to watch. They're both goofballs. In closing, I think Kripp's casting was a welcome presence and I would readily seek out his next cast to tune in. At the very least, he doesn't deserve this trollish critique that resembles more of a subjective assault on his stardom rather than a specific and evidence-supported foray into his abilities as a caster.

I downvoted you not because I disagree, but because your post is downright wrong. There is literally no other content to do besides raids, and PvP is the worst it has been ever.  As a PvP player, having leveled to 100 on the PTR(that's for free, heh) and played around my Garrison and Ashran, the content does feel incredibly dull. Why can't they just create more memorable experiences like old time AV/Wintergrasp? Indeed, what HAVE they been doing all these years? PvP just resembles the FPS genre. I honestly feel like WoW PvP devs have always tried to get away with as little as possible, and that sucks. I want siege warfare, I want things like old AV where there was strategy and other cool things in it, and it felt like a real BATTLEGROUND, not some silly CTF mode(2 factions capturing flags at each other's bases? FLAGS? Of all things it had to be flags?) or Deathmatch which are about as boring to me as they were in the FPS games."

I won't ask why you are still modded (since I know you completed what your were supposed to do initially) as I trust Rania will do whatever.

It's more like Magic: The Gathering mixed with a little bit of Hearthstone.   It seems to be a game like Hearthstone in that it is free to play but paying helps you out quite a lot by letting you get other things faster. As far as I have seen though it looks like you can get everything you can pay for, for free but at a gold or crystal cost. There are premade decks of certain orders (like the colours in Magic) that you start with but you can buy packs and other premade decks in game (both with real money and in game money).  There are some small changes that could be made to better the game, like making some things clearer and adding more of a description on the cards, but in its current state it seems to be fine. It is still in beta so there are bound to be some balance and QoL changes in the future. I can't wait to see what it grows to be."

Why did he play the game off stream in his own time, knowing that a lot of people wanted to see him play it? I didn't understand that.

I can't be alone on this. And if I am alone on it, maybe it's time for me to find some new hobbies, because I don't want to be debbie downer and ruin other peoples enjoyment."
nl_Kripparrian,3c4w7w,MileyCyrus8,2,Sun Jul 5 16:19:32 2015 UTC,"You are right, there are other ways of having fun. I will not deny that fact. You are definitely not alone about this situation.  There are plenty of people who dislike the donation system, but some of the donations were genuinely good donation messages. I got to read all of them as they came through.   TL;DR - There are positives and negatives to the system. It isn't permanent so don't fret over it too much. POE is Soon™"

Or they could be worth a few million like some already are, or they could continue to grow in worth. Worst comes to worse when the big companies come in they will look to buy out existing teams and their contracts/infrastructre rather than starting a new team from scratch. Reynad is playing it smart by moving into games that aren't already totally dominated by huge players like League or DOTA. If Heroes of the Storm is a hit, then he's already in a great spot because TS has the #1 Heroes team already."
nl_Kripparrian,3c4xxv,drewson87,-2,Sun Jul 5 01:07:11 2015 UTC,I'm saying current teams aren't going to last.  Games become irrelevant and if they don't stay good they will fall like a rock.  No one will give a fuck about TSM when league dies

He referred to players as ""that guy"" and ""that other person"", he didn't know how to properly say certain names, he didn't know who other teams were and to top it off, he used phrases like ""so and so got raped, yadda yadda raped x person"" etc.  Dude is like the most unprofessional and arrogant person I've never met. He's extremely egotistical and refuses to take the blame when he fucks up (e.g. getting permabanned in WoW and why people dislike him for breaking up with his long-time girlfriend).  To be honest it's partly Amaz's fault for even wanting to have Reckful commentate in the first place. An empty chair would do a better job than him."
nl_Kripparrian,3byixn,vaeladin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"for sure using the term ""rape"" is very bad when casting but its probably just a bad habit he have from playing wow arena with friends always using terms like ""get raped"" etc."

He just lacked the seriousness that he needed to have for casting such a big tournament. But that's just his personality.

nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,GoFYrself,2,Fri Jul 3 14:23:14 2015 UTC,It will be at least 2 more months because of all the tournaments he is booked to cast and by the time 2 months is over there will just be more tournaments in the works. If tournaments are going to affect the length and quality of the stream I hope he will at least choose them carefully instead of just taking every offer that comes his way.  Remember that garbage tournament on Hitbox he casted multiple times? It was pulling in like 300 viewers and had tons of technical problems. That's not worth short streams/sleepy Kripp to his stream viewers..

nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,Aliwonderland,0,Tue Jul 14 05:16:45 2015 UTC,Kripp doesn't need the extra money a 8 hour stream gets him since he doesn't have to pay rent anymore.
nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,Camplify,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:30:37 2015 UTC,He lives with his old man right? Wouldnt Kripp's stream income allow them to purchase their own home? Or at the very least a very decent appartment? Or is he saving for something big?
nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,Que-Hegan,9,Fri Jul 3 08:46:28 2015 UTC,He's saving for muscle implants.
nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,theinternetlol,3,Fri Jul 3 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, we really do need a sticky on Kripp's moving situation."
nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,HerpJersey,2,Fri Jul 3 09:45:22 2015 UTC,Kripp is making a lot of money. He's one of the biggest Twitch streamers and has a very healthy Youtube channel. I have no idea how his sponsorships and casting pays out but it's just more icing on the cake.  The problem he's at now is that he's pretty busy between all of that stuff and I believe they are still working on getting Rania citizenship so I have to imagine that it's difficult to go out and buy a house when you could just live with your family while it all gets sorted out.
nl_Kripparrian,3byuhj,lolatredditors,-3,Fri Jul 3 18:07:03 2015 UTC,If the choice is shorter streams and kripp doing more events. Im cool with it.
nl_Kripparrian,3c2y8e,drewson87,5,Sat Jul 4 06:57:00 2015 UTC,"If you notice, almost every tournament Kripp casts on (Challengestone, this HTC one going on right now, and others I can't remember), Rania is the admin or working with the admins. She gets flown out to stuff like ESL and seat story too. She's not doing it for free. I would assume its part of the deal to get Kripp. To get Kripp you have to pay Rania as well.   That being said, she also has a PHD and had a job and her own place which Kripp lived in for like a year. Its also probably not every gold digger's (if thats what you are insinuating thats what she is) dream to live in their boyfriends dad's basement. Leave Rania alooooooone!"
nl_Kripparrian,3c2y8e,caramelsmidgens,10,Sat Jul 4 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"This subreddit is a joke.  It was fine when you guys just complained about Hearthstone, now it's petty personal attacks."
nl_Kripparrian,3c2y8e,Shyt-Just-Got-Real,-6,Sat Jul 4 11:34:24 2015 UTC,"well, kripp betrayed his supporters/viewers by selling out in every way possible and changing every aspect of himself for the first girl who would talk to him... what do you expect? he isn't the same person anymore so we are firing some shots at him to make sure he knows it."
nl_Kripparrian,3c2y8e,caramelsmidgens,10,Sat Jul 4 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"You realize he's trying to build a life right?  You know streamers come and go really fast and this is a very volatile profession? He should very well make as much money as possible while he's still popular.  The only thing that most likely came from his relationship was realizing he needs to build for the future, he was doing HS 24/7 for months before Rania even came around.    And ""take shots""?  It's firing back by making shitty personal attacks like this one?  Threads like this are just completely toxic in nature and have no place on a fan forum.  Like the Hearthstone whining every day for the past couple years was annoying, but it's harmless.  It's just been escalating way too far here lately."
nl_Kripparrian,3c2y8e,Shyt-Just-Got-Real,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"by his own admission he was doing fine financially back when it was just the stream and youtube, suddenly after meeting her it's imperative that he has sub callouts, sponsors, hosts tournaments in his channel, joins a well known team, experiments with text-to-speech, starts casting half the time instead of streaming, etc?   That all happened in the span of about a year.. he was already living comfortably off his stream and youtube before, so what he's doing now is over the top greed influenced by his Yoko Ono and it will only hasten his downfall as a popular streamer as its turning people like me who used to be a fan, into no longer liking him. How many more drastic changes does he have to make for money before even blind, sheeplike fanboys like yourself realize he's not the same person anymore and isnt worth watching?"
nl_Kripparrian,3c2y8e,caramelsmidgens,5,Sat Jul 4 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"He was living comfortably while living with his parents/dad.  He's buying his own grown up house and living on his own money now.  He has to save up while he can, this type of career won't last forever and this career won't give him any skills or references to find a real job after it runs out.  He'll hopefully save up enough to live off of for a good long while.  Ad money doesn't pay for shit anymore, you have to do donations or acknowledge subs now.  Destiny, someone who gets around Kripp's old numbers makes almost all of his money off of his own sub system and donations, he's mentioned ad revenue makes up an almost negligible amount and wouldn't be able to live off of it while owning a house..  Not doing these simple things is pretty much leaving free money on the table and denying yourself a good income for no reason.  You guys keep saying these things will hasten his downfall, when he's been getting 20-30k consistently since switching to Hearthstone and selling out almost 2 years ago.  If he stuck with POE and kept his stream the exact same he'd probably still be getting 2k viewers, if he was lucky, and would never have been able to afford buying a nice house and save up for his future.  It's greed influenced by wanting to have a good, comfortable life and build a family I'm sure.  She isn't some evil person, horrible person."

You are welcome to browse in this subreddit, and you will quickly realize that the only thing I'm not accused of (yet) is deleting posts - and that's just because there are mod logs and I can prove I'm not deleting any.   Neither Kripp nor I are the creators of the subreddits about him, so  we didn't make the rules. As exhausting as it gets sometimes, I try to handle it with humour.

As a mod, I can also see that a lot of the posts were deleted, although I can't find a pattern for that. I assume that since I'm the next mod on the list, the subreddit goes to me, but I will not delete or reopen it. It's Donny's subreddit and whenever he gets reinstated he can have it back.   I will not go into any judgement about donny's behavious or whatever. I do encourage every and each one of us to first look at themselves and try to realize how obnoxious & weird people may thing we are, if they knew everything we do / read / say / think throughout the day.

Regardless of everyone despising him, he deserved to be banned. Manipulating votes affects the subreddit negatively regardless of why someone did it. It is pitiful for someone to do it. It just shows you that everyone was right about him and how he acts, as he would not have done it otherwise."
nl_Kripparrian,3bwbqo,underflowR,6,Thu Jul 2 22:21:57 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that I don't want to be involved in the bad subreddit / good subreddit controversy by taking over the casualkripp subreddit. Yes, I see the point of its existence, as this subreddit can be very toxic, but Kripp and I have a thick skin.   I don't know what happened, and if donny got banned for vote manipulation, but it's also very possible that he was banned because he violated the 9:1 rule of reddit. I'm saying that because, if he did indeed manipulate votes, that wasn't really successful, most of his posts were downvoted as hell, or am I missing something? It's also very possible that he just deleted his account himself, you know."
nl_Kripparrian,3bwbqo,__Saga__,3,Thu Jul 2 22:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yes this subreddit is painfully toxic (rehashing same topics  since last year and bashing Kripp over anything) but we both know casualkripp wasn't created for a 'safe haven for Kripparrian discussion'. But whatever, Donny is allowed to make another Reddit account so he can keep his subreddit, he just can't post on this one anymore as it is evasion.

They know what they would expect and where his stream is evolving to.   Kripp has been streaming forever with multiple different games, and has used a clean setup with as few distractions as possible (with some mumblebros here and there). Some watch him for WoW, some watch him for D3/PoE, some watch him for hearthstone. Some watch him for the asmr atmosphere, some for his character or how well he plays.  What I'm saying is that poeple usually go to Twitch to see what they know and when kripp makes a change in his stream he's going to annoy at least some of his viewer segments while a guy like forsen basically only has one viewer segment to annoy (though the guys that really liked to raid grills hate on tyggbar now)"

Why are you so hated in this community?     Because he acts like a superior asshole who thinks he is better than everyone else. He came in from nowhere and proclaimed himself to know every single detail about Kripp's life, whilst only ever watching him from early 2014. Then he proceeded to suck Kripparrian's dick until he noticed him as well as the fact he cried to Rania when he got banned from here from shitposting every single instagram post and flooding the subreddit. After Rania unbanned him (much to the other moderators disapproval afaik) he continued shitposting, this time in the comments. This guy has a huge superiority complex because he is insignificant in real life, he wants himself to be heard no matter where he as at any time as 'any attention is positive attention', and this shows off in his smug/snide comments on the subreddit. He was even more hated and completely shunned in the EVE online community after fucking over someone who made a RMT deal with him, as well as doing the exact same thing as I wrote above.   Why do you care so much about the personal life of one man?   He wants a soapbox, and latching onto Kripp is one way of getting one. Aspergers or some other thing is probably involved too I'm sure, whatever Leifman has.   You constantly praise Kripp then bash him other times, what do you expect to game from this?   I think he is more obsessed with Rania these days rather than Kripp. I think he finally saw Kripp for who he really is; a hypocrite sellout. He is always bragging how he gets to talk with Rania on Skype, alongside that other Kripp cocksucker HufferNudes, although Huffer isn't nearly as bad.   Why did you make another subreddit around Kripp when this one exists? Was it because Kripp wouldn't mod you?    Like I said before, he wants a soapbox, he did the exact same thing with the EVE community writing a blog for random shit no one cared about/looked at, even movie reviews which were less viewed. His superiority complex makes himself feel more important then everyone else thus he has to make a platform where it appears everyone will listen to him, hence the subreddit with only two other participants, despite being updated daily. He was modded out of pity for being banned here and everyone hating on him and by complaining, much like Leifman who PM'd Kripp relentlessly until he was modded, but Leifman really isn't bad.  inb4 YOU are obsessed with Donny. No, I have being following the trials and tribulations of 'ol Poetic since the EVE days, you see he was laughed at there on a far much larger scale than he is here now and this is just shit you pick up after years of him pushing shit in everyone's faces. And just as I'd thought he would be gone with EVE he shows up in the HS community. He is a fucking cockroach.  Oh and lets not forget https://np.reddit.com/r/feet/comments/29vzm7/cute_tho_not_what_she_was_intending_anyone_to/ for good measure.

In 1932, he began his medical career in Theodor Meynert's psychiatric clinic at the Trollstein General Hospital. The same year, he married Mamarrian, the granddaughter of Isaac Bernays, a chief rabbi in Hamburg. In the summer of 1935, the couple had a beautiful and gifted child: Kripp. On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws who deprived so-called ""non-Aryans"" of the benefits of German citizenship. The young parents, extremely afraid for the future of their beautiful child, where confronted to a question that would forever change the fate of the world: was Krip Aryan?"

It also will get spammed like crazy as its his first time doing it at all, same thing even happened to Reynad and he already was reading them out before turning it on, in Kripp's case no one has been able to make him read their witty copy-pasta ever and now they have a very cheap way to make a robot do it.   Also I thought Paypal ate up most of the $0.50 cent donations in the first place, is he even getting anything from those?  But yeah on other streams that have had Text-to-speech on for a long while and a minimum donation required amount it usually isn't spammed all stream long and is pretty easy to put up with, may also just be something you expect on those streams."

nl_Kripparrian,3bhwju,Huffy778,32,Mon Jun 29 10:38:58 2015 UTC,"What's next? Donations? How long before those are normal?   It's funny you mention that. I tuned in to his stream for a few minutes today and I think I heard him say he was planning on doing a sellout stream for his birthday, with twitch alerts/donations and all of that shit. He says it will be a one time thing, but can you imagine if he's doing it to test the water before deciding whether or not to adopt that donation model for his regular streams?   Destiny did the same thing with his stream. He enabled donations and TTS for his birthday, originally planning for it to be a one time thing...but then he couldn't resist that dirty donation money so now he has it on permanently."
nl_Kripparrian,3bhwju,Morgoth2356,5,Mon Jun 29 11:31:43 2015 UTC,"If this is true you can be sure it will become the regular thing, and to be honest it's not surprising me at all. At the end of the day, the audience he was aiming with all that ""not streamer but only gamer"" attitude back when he started streaming is for the most part long gone and his current target market won't give a shit about him going full sell-out mode once and for all."
nl_Kripparrian,3bhwju,danzey12,2,Mon Jun 29 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"Meh, if he starts that I'll likely just stop watching him, currently he starts streaming at like 4 in the morning and ends at like 9/10/11 thanks to these short streams, so if I get up and immediately start watching I have like 1-2 hours which isn't really worthwhile. It'll be sad to not get my kripp fix s'pose I could just watch his youtube videos."

The truth is that I tried to stream as much as I could but so many days I have had to wake up 4-6 hours after my early ended ones -- and Im not adjusting well to the back and forth schedule. Ive tried streaming a little more than I should have on some days but I just end up being a total fucking zombie the next day and I end up netting the same stream hours overall anyway.  It will probably be a while until I can even try to make the 8 hour stream possible because im casting like 5 multi day tournaments this month, and another 5 the next. Many of these, as well as real life events dont really let me stream as long as id like.  Eventually ill be streaming as much as I had in the past, but right now theres just too much going on. I really am doing my best"

nl_Kripparrian,3bhwju,zabuma,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:52:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, he needs to be honest about it. If he plans for the summer to do 5 hours, just say so. Which I can see as a thing, Canadian winters can be a bitch.   Also, if you think about it, an 8 hour stream, and then making videos, and staying current with games and possibly other interests he shares, takes up a lot of time. I think all his fans would be fine with a shorter stream, but like everyone is saying, just say so.  Honesty builds integrity, and integrity breeds loyalty. That loyalty and following is what's gets the tournament casting spots( which I assume are the bigger paydays) and kripp is a great tournament caster. I enjoy his predictions and humor.  I think kripp has a lot of potential in broadcasting yet to be unfolded. First he should be discovering that. I hope he has a lot planned for his ""birthday show"" to be turning on donations. Please don't ask for money unless your giving something back.  Sorry, I started with one thought and then went on a rant."
nl_Kripparrian,3bhwju,HoneyMuffinz,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:37:38 2015 UTC,"Donations/ sponsor graphics I have no problem with (as long as they're done in good taste), people have to make putting all that time and effort into streaming worth it. I do understand that Kripp probably has a good amount of regular subscribers, but if people are willing to give more money than just a subscription, they're within their rights to do that.  But that TTS shit is annoying as hell, will never be funny and really does lower the quality of the stream significantly. It's amazing what people are willing to just to be acknowledged by a streamer. It's like rich people donating a ton of money just to try to become friends with a streamer..."

nl_Kripparrian,3bj2ms,not_worth_your_time,10,Mon Jun 29 17:41:00 2015 UTC,Honestly its because if for some reason he can't reach legend then his whole casting career is thrown into question. So he just avoids it so that can never happen.
nl_Kripparrian,3bj2ms,newfor2015,14,Mon Jun 29 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"He should have just gotten it over with early on so he won't have this hanging over his head for eternity. It's now gotten to the point where the only way he'll attempt it is if he goes on a winning streak for no reason and became rank 1 or 2 on a lark, he'll be so close that he'll just go for it without even trying.   I think that's his play style at a lot of things. He'll only go for a guaranteed overkill, if he's not confident he can do it, he'll just casually grind on an easy level and not risk losing. Time is something he has plenty of, and he can patiently grind things out until he's way over leveled for the content he's playing before advancing on the next level challenge.   This kind of things is useful for hardcore ARPG like Diablo or POE, and even most recently, Darkest Dungeon. This is not good for a game like Hearthstone because there is no such thing as overleveling in Hearthstone. There's nothing you can do to improve your chances of success past a certain percentage.  If I go further into Kripp's psyche, I would say actually it's the way he's living his life in general. He's playing games all day because he enjoys it, but it's also because he's good at it already. There's no chance for him to fail at video game, and even if he fails, it doesn't mean anything... just start over and rebuild a character. There's no risk at all. He rather cast than compete in competition because by casting, he can't lose. He casts because it fall on him by accident and it turns out he's decent at it so that's what he ends up doing. He's all about no sponsors in the beginning and actually talks down on it, making a bunch of excuses about how it makes his stream uncluttered, how he doesn't need it, how he's keeping it real etc... but I think it's really because he won't risk a rejection if he doesn't ask to be sponsored. It is only when sponsorships just  comes knocking on his door, he doesn't mind taking it at all, and all that talk about keeping it real goes out the window in a second.  I can go on, but I wont."
nl_Kripparrian,3bj2ms,not_worth_your_time,3,Mon Jun 29 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"I'll go on for you.  I also think a component of this is differentiating himself from other twitch streamers. For the longest time he was the only popular arena streamer (now ratsmah has recently come to fame). So he can either be the best in his market segment or he can play constructed and compete with Reynad, Trump, Kolento, etc He will lose significant viewers if that were to happen as many twitch viewers love seeing their favorite games played at the very highest level. If Kripp can't perform at that level then he will lose that demographic. Even if he can play at that level he still has to share the demographic. Instead, he opts to just play Arena at the very highest level for that same demographic (perceived highest level as no one can say that someone else is any better than him as there are no rankings, they just see him play it infinitely and assume he's awesome).  All around its a business decision."
nl_Kripparrian,3bj2ms,Yegie,7,Mon Jun 29 20:47:42 2015 UTC,I think he is afraid of if he one time says <<I will reach legend>> and then does not then everyone will realize how much of a failure/casual he is stop watching him.

I don't agree with him, but there's no debating it. He just enjoys playing it more than other options. It's that simple. You can agree or disagree with him but he's not making decisions on what to play off of money -- the decision is on what he finds fun to play."

I tried to reslove this problem and started reading steam comments only to see that there are lots of people having issues with this game system requirements. You mentioned that one of the devs was watching your stream and i was wondering if you could ask that dev if they could fix/reduce their weird system requirement. For example i can run every Blizzard game on low details but i cannot get to start Darkest Dungeon."

nl_Kripparrian,3b5y7u,suejak,4,Fri Jun 26 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"Wastes of time can be fun. What I mean is that he seemed more like he was just dicking around, rather than really digging deep into a game -- which is why I watch Kripp in the first place."

Understanding the intricacies of your mana curve (not really doable in Arena), when to make actual plays (these days Kripp seems obsessed with ""muh tempo"" over anything else), just plain deck creation (again, not really applicable to Arena), and so on are just a few examples.  While playing and winning games blindfolded is neat, it doesn't mean you're better at the game than anyone, only that you are good at keeping track of the game state in your head. Some people play games of chess entirely in their heads against one another, doesn't mean they have a chance against a grandmaster."

nl_Kripparrian,3alkaa,t4mo,10,Sun Jun 21 12:01:30 2015 UTC,Kripp and most big streamers make a lot of money.
nl_Kripparrian,3alkaa,Snatat,9,Sun Jun 21 12:31:52 2015 UTC,Most of his money comes from youtube. That's why it's so critical to make a video every day. It looks like he easily gets 250K views per video so he makes a big portion from youtube.  Then he gets $2.50 per sub on Twitch and whatever ad revenue brings+donations. Obviously streaming 8 hours of Hearthstone for 20K viewers will likely earn more from Twitch. This takes a hit when he streams something else so youtube is a lot more stable from a income standpoint.  All in all I'd say Kripp easily earns 6 figures probably better managed since dating Rania or she is draining him like the succubus that she is ;)  Tl:dr Fat
nl_Kripparrian,3alkaa,JupitersClock,2,Mon Jun 22 04:43:15 2015 UTC,"No he said that most of his money comes from Twtch, watch the video i linked."

Even when you render the final video in your editing software to be 720p or higher, the quality loss will always be visible in videos. I have the same issue with many of the videos I make for youtube. Not much that can be done about it. And directly downloading huge VODs, thus preserving the original video data quality, is near impossible (due to restrictions on downloading possibilities of for instance Nightdev)."

nl_Kripparrian,3a0foi,assassin5,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:37:07 2015 UTC,I think the reason Kripp sees it as more than 4k dust is because it relieves him from crafting those cards. A golden legendary alone is 3200 dust. Golden murloc is 1600 if he didn't have it.

nl_Kripparrian,38xwfo,welpcomma,9,Mon Jun 8 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"HS is fun but unless you have a lot of time and money to dedicate to it, there's not much point in being too engaged with the game.  I have zero interest in playing Constructed, just the same 4-5 decks over and over. I will play sometimes for quest gold and card backs, but it's fairly fucking boring imo.  Arena is a blast, and I get pretty good results. But even with 7 wins and the daily missions (~50 gold), you're still only able to average 1.333 Arena runs per day, and that's optimistic. Arena is somewhat better since GvG matured, and I've recently been playing again after a half-year hiatus. But there's no way I'm paying two real dollars to potentially draft complete trash and go 0-3 through absolutely no fault of my own. It's not fun. Skill does play a major factor, don't get me wrong. But to get better, you have to play more. To play more, you have to pay. Even Kripp will lose thousands of gold on some bad runs. I'm still saving up for Blackrock.  It's a fun game but it can be equally frustrating when the luck doesn't flow. As long as I'm not spending real money that's fine, but if I'm going to be putting down cash, I might as well go to the casino and have a chance at getting something better than a 12-0 screen shot that I forget about a week later anyway.  Much more satisfying to watch Kripp's ups and downs."

Thinking chat will somehow ""ruin"" his stream is illogical and has no ground. Yes he can have ""annoying"" friends that tend to spawn the occasional cancer, but he will remove them if they get to the point where he is annoyed by THEM, not by chat."

nl_Kripparrian,37vr8f,MileyCyrus8,9,Sat May 30 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"I remember a couple of weeks ago when Kratis was spamming something along the lines ""When i say TUCK you say FRUMP"" just to get the chat to spam TUCK FRUMP. Kripps response to Kratis was something like ""Just because youre on my friends list doesnt mean you get to spam stupid shit, i will remove you. Just a fair warning.""   (No i dont have a timestamp for proof, but its out there on a VOD and im sure someone can back me up on this.)  Kripp at least seem to care about people not spamming his HS client, which is exactly what Kratis is doing."

Kratis, no one likes you, and unless Kripp wants the future chat to turn into a complete cesspool of shit á la Forsen style he should seriously concider getting rid of the morons who contribute nothing more than filling the chat with even more useless dank memes.  I cant be the only one who is just filled with utter disgust every time i see Kratis name pop up with yet another genius message, day after day.

In arena, your deck quality is RNG, your opponents deck is RNG, the draws are RNG, your opponent is RNG.  It's pretty hard to tell if you're playing that shitty deck well or because of RNG. A high quality arena deck can still draw very poorly and die to a 1-3 deck. There is just so much variance in arena, which is why Kripp will do very well sometimes and other times very poorly."

There's just a few classes that are good and a small set of cards that are good, so you see the same match ups game after game, and you pick the same cards, game after game. It's true for arena, it's true for constructed.  Each turn takes so long, the animation and sound effects are cool the first time you see it, but it's so tedious to sit there and have to watch every card flip, every casting effect to play out. There's no way to speed it up or just have everything resolve instantly. Most of the time you're sitting there just wishing the opponent hurries up and finish their turn.  It takes well over an hour to go through 1 arena run, and what's your reward? some gold to allow you to play again and a pack of shitty card?  It's a game you'd play for a while and then you stop playing. It's not something you'd do for years on end like Kripp has been doing.

nl_Kripparrian,36uxxp,PleaseStopPostingPls,6,Fri May 22 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I personally don't think that anyone, and least of all Kripp, would be able to play a game that he is having absolutely no fun with, for so many hours a day, every day.  I think he enjoys certain games more than HS, PoE being one of them since he even admitted to playing it off-stream during Eurovision, which means it was his choice of game when only fun mattered, but I don't think he considers HS a moneygrinding bore either. To him, it's probably just a casual pastime that has its moments, just like it is for most people that play it. And to be honest, a casual pastime that has its moments and nets you a huge increase of income is pretty much the perfect job.  Anyway, I am just hoping that he'll listen to the advice of certain conciliatory voices that are asking for at least a few days per week of a different game other than HS. That would be good enough for me. (And dropping the brofists and some other overly pretentious bullshit would be nice too.)"

But I'm sure it's gonna get the Dark Souls 2 treatment where he misses release hype and refuses to play it because of that. I have no idea how Rania convinced Kripp to play GTAV tho... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Accept reality: HS is his 9-5 full time job, he is not a gamer anymore. He doesn't have a say in what he plays anymore, its either play HS full time or lose 75% of his income (and give someone else a chance to take over his viewership/timeslot and risk not getting it back). Living with Rania now he has more expenses and can't afford to go away from HS for long, so it's going to be HS forever until the wheels fall off of this twitch thing."

nl_Kripparrian,35x97h,QuikNatio,6,Thu May 14 08:03:19 2015 UTC,"It's just an excuse for him to continue playing the game. When the game was still in beta his goal was to get all classes to level 60, at which point he said he would stop playing the game. But then he saw how popular HS was becoming, so instead of moving to another game he came up with a new goal.   He knows that if he does manage to reach his goal it won't be for a long time yet. At the rate Blizzard is releasing expansions I wouldn't be surprised if he never reaches it. If HS wasn't so popular I guarantee he would have stopped playing when he got all classes to level 60. Like many people Kripp needs to have a long-term goal when playing games to give him motivation to keep playing."
nl_Kripparrian,35x97h,RawerPower,2,Thu May 14 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"His reasons are stupid. Someone had a topic that said Kripp will never get all Golden with dust at the rate Blizzard releases expansion unless he spends 500$ on cards again ... or does some drastic thing like plays only the NA account 16h/day.  He saves a few hundred dust every 6 months when Blizzard nerfs some cards at most. You can watch this video where he ""explains"" his reasons  I think it's one of the reasons he is using as to ""why you still play HS ?"" apart of the $ reason. If he'd just press That dust button, craft the cards then drop 500$ he'd have all the cards and he should be done with HS as he'd not have any goal anymore."
nl_Kripparrian,35x97h,MrJillHace,3,Thu May 14 09:32:00 2015 UTC,"I checked that. Today he had 13,335 dust on hand and 169,750 dust on button. In April Fools day video he had 17,720 dust on hand and 155,575 dust on button. I think he crafted 2 golden legendaries (judging by the amount of dust disappeared from hand). 6400 + (13335+169750) - (17720+155575) = 16,190 dust per 1 and half month. 10k dust per month Too bad he haven't said today how much dust he miss.

nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,HomicidalPhilosopher,10,Tue May 12 16:24:58 2015 UTC,Yes he played it 3 days : http://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/b/491173777 http://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/b/491427857 http://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/b/491665009
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,Devil_Demize,5,Tue May 12 17:44:44 2015 UTC,He never really played music in his streams
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,foddon,2,Tue May 12 20:27:10 2015 UTC,He's talking about the new rule which deletes all vods old than 2 weeks (I believe) and not highlighted.
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,x410,2,Wed May 13 00:00:07 2015 UTC,Large partners are exceptions to the rule.
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,schnupfndrache7,5,Wed May 13 02:08:15 2015 UTC,i guess somewhere between 2900 and 3500 hours is the magical number where a game start getting boring - glad to see him looking for new games to play now!  btw interesting to see how little diablo 3 he play considering that it was the game that made his stream big !  ps: would be nice to see the hours / views ratio !
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,C_L_I_C_K,0,Wed May 13 05:31:34 2015 UTC,You're joking right? The majority of games Kripp has streamed are below 100 hours. He has only streamed 2 games over 700 hours: PoE and Hearthstone. He's been bored of these games for a long time but he won't admit it. Money is the only thing keeping him from switching to other games.
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,schnupfndrache7,-2,Tue May 12 18:44:49 2015 UTC,Well just look at lirik how he has most viewers when he starts a new game! Those are the most entertaining streams for me to watch
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,C_L_I_C_K,7,Wed May 13 11:35:19 2015 UTC,"That's because Lirik built his fanbase into what it is today. Lirik is one of the only ""variety streamers"" who can constantly switch games and keep his 30k+ viewerbase. People watch Lirik for his personality, not just the games he plays. He is able to make people laugh with the crazy and stupid shit he says and does in games.  Kripp on the other hand, cornered himself into being only a Hearthstone streamer. Most of his fans won't follow him to other games. He simply can't maintain his 30k+ viewership in any game other than Hearthstone and it's because he was too greedy and/or scared to play new releases and diversify when he had the chance. He betrayed and ditched all of his oldschool / hardcore fans and friends... for money and casual Hearthstone fanboys."
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,schnupfndrache7,3,Wed May 13 11:43:21 2015 UTC,Well tbh those hearthstone viewers don't watch his stream because it's kripp playing hearthstone.. they would watch any other big hearthstone streamer aswell. Thats just the snowball effect of twitch: people go to hearthstone streams and see who has most viewers then they see kripp and klick on his stream... but they wold also watch trump amaz forsen or reynad if they were online
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,RawerPower,5,Wed May 13 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for these stats. Nice work !  He didn't really respected the ""Broadcaster plays X game"" everytime.   Pretty sure he played Savage more than 2 hours. That was played a lot under D3, WoW and POE. I think it's the same for Prismata and Magic played under Hearthstone."
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,foddon,5,Wed May 13 13:13:56 2015 UTC,Average of 8 hours a day over the course of 3 years is pretty insane.
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,Pipso,3,Tue May 12 20:46:14 2015 UTC,I know this is regarding streaming stats specifically but I couldn't imagine the amount of hours if you could add his time playing games like Diablo 2 and World of Warcraft BC/Lich King. Possibly even his Dark Age hours to add on all that. He has been a gamer his entire life and its cool to see these sort of stats
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,QuikNatio,1 point,Wed May 13 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"So it took him 2900 hours to get burnt out on PoE, but he still hasn't burnt out on a casual card game after 3500 hours. Right..  I wish he'd just tell the truth."
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,t3hjs,8,Wed May 13 00:02:39 2015 UTC,"Besides monetary reasons, different games have different replayability. I don't know how often PoE adds content, but Hearthstone is not slouch either."

The guy is just looking to make as much money is possible for himself, his wife, and future kids. Who wouldn't do the same?"

nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,Ndlovunkulu,5,Tue May 12 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"There's a group of people on this subreddit who believe that even though Kripp plays 8 hours of Hearthstone a day and has said Path of Exile is a grind, that he secretly hates HS and pines for PoE.  They consider it their sworn duty to make at least one comment per thread and downvote all references to Hearthstone that don't mention the words ""money"" or ""casual.""  They've been waiting for about 2 years for Kripp to wake up one day and say ""Wow.  You guys were so right.  I really do love PoE."""
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,Devil_Demize,7,Tue May 12 20:14:17 2015 UTC,I don't think it has anything specifically to do with poe but more of the fact that you can tell he doesn't enjoy hearthstone as much as he'd admit. At least he genuinely liked poe and D3 the start. Liked other games even though they didn't have good end game or replayability.   It's obvious that ever since he moved and talking to his Gf /manager and people like artosis that they figured out that hearthstone is without a doubt his best source to build a fan base and money source.  He made decent money before he moved but now he is with someone and is gonna have to fund a wedding and a house plus eventually a family. Why do that with decent money when you can do it with a shit load instead and have less stress later in life.   I don't watch anymore cuz it's stressful to see stress.. But I understand and would do the same thing in his shoes. Money is better than old fans because he gets 100 new ones in their place.
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,QuikNatio,1 point,Tue May 12 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that he got burnt out on PoE. I just find it strange that he hasn't been burnt out on Hearthstone after playing it for longer, considering that it's a casual card game with far less depth. What /u/Devil_Demize said is exactly right. Kripp clearly doesn't enjoy HS as much as he used to but he continues to play it because it's the best choice for his streaming career. I just wish he would admit that rather than give us bullshit excuses."
nl_Kripparrian,35q19k,Que-Hegan,0,Wed May 13 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"It's actually much more simple: we simply cant understand how someone can play (casual) Hearthstone for so long and NOT be burned out from it. If he, as he says, actually got burned out of POE(which, seeing as much and as hardcore as he played it, is very much possible) the same should have happened with HS a long time ago."

I'm not asking him to go to PoE or Diablo, though it would be a nice change up every once in awhile. Even Trump and Reynad play other games. Honestly, how often Kripp plays Hearthstone, there really is zero reason he shouldn't at least attempt legend. Kripp streams longer than another Hearthstone streamer, then whines that it would take forever to get legend. It isn't hate on all. I just would prefer when Kripp actually wanted to achieve stuff in his stream. Now he just acts salty for his viewers in a character like Amaz. Difference is I actually like it when Amaz does it.

Anyone who has watched Kripp since his WoW/Diablo 3 days would completely disagree. It's very easy to tell the difference in his stream. The older Kripp would at the very least would be pushing Legend or all 9 golden portraits ,considering he plays the game so much. That's just who he was back then. And it's not like much has changed, a woman and some sponsorships didn't change that. Kripp used to spend a week on hardcore farming goblins waiting for good items to drop in order to progress. He wouldn't even get salty when drops didn't happen. Now, Kripp is complaining about ""grinding"" in a game that he literally has played for 8+ hours/day for nearly 2 years. He obviously is still fun to watch which is why we still are here, but it would just be nice to see Kripp trying to achieve something instead of just doing Arena over and over again. At least early on in the game Kripp was pushing all level 60's. Now he isn't really doing anything. He just does this ""salty old man character"" for viewers."

nl_Kripparrian,35g0xt,Optilex,5,Sun May 10 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"What does it have to do with viewers anyway? The reason he has a lot of viewers now is because he played Hearthstone when the hype train got launched, coupled with his already existing fanbase. But that doesn't prevent him from "" being Kripp "". If Kripp was as hardcore as before, I bet your ass he would have already unlocked every golden portraits ( or being close to it ), would try to get legend all season in a very fast fashion ( he previously set world records so it wouldn't surprise me ) or at least theorycraft a bit more and provide better spreadsheets, data and game samples. To be honest the daily videos are nice, but are far from being as complete and accurate than his previous ones.   I don't really know what changed to be honest. Maybe he really went casual because he wanted to be casual, and in my opinions this sucks but I respect that. But if it's because of another reason, this is a bit bullshit."

Internet is filled with gamers wanting to have fun and not taking games seriously. Proof: the most known youtubers and streamers are really not the most hardcore gamers, far from there. On the other hand, Kripp was the opposite: hardcore at heart, wanting to beat everything and never satisfied until he reached first positions and set records and make exploits.

nl_Kripparrian,359cff,sertman,1 point,Fri May 8 08:27:36 2015 UTC,"Kripp would easily without any problems be able to sustain a decent income by streaming the latest aRPG for 20 hours a day, but he got other priorities in life now."
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Zyget,3,Fri May 8 18:53:04 2015 UTC,"which is totally fine, people get older and their priorities change. i don't play as many games as a 26 year old as i did as a 19 year old. i have other shit to worry about now. and he definitely would not be making the kind of money as an aRPG streamer as he does as a HS streamer and youtube content creator."
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,sertman,1 point,Fri May 8 06:24:31 2015 UTC,"I never said he would make the same only that he would be able to sustain a good living, kripp has always been a youtube content creator."
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Zyget,-2,Fri May 8 09:54:10 2015 UTC,Then why doesn't he get legend?
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Seriouscatt,9,Fri May 8 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe because he thinks that's a boring grind and he'd rather play creative decks/arena, also that he doesn't feel he needs to prove himself to the 10~ whining redditors. Idk"
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,HufferNudes,-2,Sat May 9 13:11:20 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is grinding. You do the same actions, game after game. Kripp also plays arena, prefering the same class arena after arena. Why does every Hearthstone fan think people who critizice Kripp - hate him?"
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Seriouscatt,3,Fri May 8 09:27:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, I never said it wasn't a grind, every single game is sort of a grind in that sense, just that you have to make a choice on what kind of grind you find more enjoyable.  There's a difference between constructive criticism and just pure whining and complaining though. As a ""hearthstone fan"" I've criticized Kripp many times. But I do it in a constructive way, and in private, either to him directly through PM's, or through Rania/mod team"
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,HufferNudes,-1,Fri May 8 10:24:21 2015 UTC,"The only whining is from Kripp about every game of hearthstone he plays. Kripp is the only Hearthstone streamer to play nothing but Hearthstone for the last year and a half. In responce, Kripp complains on stream about how this whole reddit hates him when all people are doing is pointing out his hypocritical bullshit which Hearthstone viewers just eat up"
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Seriouscatt,1 point,Fri May 8 10:40:32 2015 UTC,"The only whining is from Kripp   Let me stop you right there.  Not too long ago, you just wrote   ""How you just want him to be happy"" You honestly think Kripp is happy playing Hearthstone? All he does is complain and make excuses about how its not his fault he misplayed or how his opponent is more lucky than him. You think he does all of this because it makes him happy? He only does it for money, nothing more nothing less.   Would you file this under constructive criticism?  Or it more just petulant complaining?"

nl_Kripparrian,359cff,infamouscheater,8,Fri May 8 17:11:20 2015 UTC,"I added this sub because I thought it would be taking about his videos except it's more like a twitter bashing. Dude brings content and everyone hates, shame on you all."

The old Kripp would've had fucking spreadhseet upon spreadsheet, data backed by actuall hard testing, min/maxed decks and results an at least a believable sample size. Quality content? Fkn pewdiepie puts more effort into his videos and that guy is cancer...."
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Gimdir,3,Sat May 9 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not here to argue that Kripp's videos should be loved and cherished.  It doesn't matter to me one way or the other.  You can think they're stupid or boring or even whiny for all I care.  But when most people in the world dislike content, they go find something that they do like, watch that instead, and blow off said cancer.  The people on this sub just want to sit around and moan about how happy they used to be 18 months ago when all was right with the world and they still had the love of their life.  So my question is why.  Is it about the easy karma or the self-validation?"
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,infamouscheater,2,Fri May 8 05:39:49 2015 UTC,"And here lies the problem. I can't find a guy to watch that's as entertaining as Kripp but plays games hardcore for 15 hours a day, thinks the outside is boring and has bad graphics, thinks grills are a waste of gaming time nad min/maxes the shit out of everything he does. The closest thing in taking a game this serious I can think off is Havoc in PoE but dude looks like his own voice is putting him to sleep. There is no one like Kripp ""used to"" be so we have nowhere to go..."

Your points are weak, he isn't the same anymore? it's called change people do it. You want spreadsheets? No one is holding you back."
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,infamouscheater,3,Fri May 8 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"So if I don't make videos myself I can't judge the quality of videos I watch? Today I learned; guess every game/video/tv-show/etc reviewer is full of shit; Thank you for educating me wise sir. And you are right, Kripp is a great entertainer, rivaling some of the greatest stand-up comedians ever (at least when his mic isn't muted for 2 hours while he stuffs his face with fries); I just wish it didin't come at the cost of him no longer being serious about anything."
nl_Kripparrian,359cff,Gimdir,-3,Sat May 9 07:43:57 2015 UTC,"You can judge, your just an asshole with a shitty opinion and complaining in fan sub comparing him to completely different genres of entertainment."

People are just following in the footsteps of our dear leader Kripp. He whines every stream.

I just have one question that I haven't fully wrapped my head around because I'm a bit slow (I do play casualstone after all).  Since you consider whining and ""hardcore"" to be one in the same, which came first, the whining or the ""hardcore""?  Like were you born a whiner and that led you into the hardcore life or were you born hardcore and that forced you to become bitter and whiny.  Just curious."

If this is starting to sound like that one girl in high school who couldn't accept reality when her boyfriend broke up with her, then I think you're starting to get my point."

Both him and Rania thought that would be a good idea, although the past weeks has been insanely busy (blackrock expansion, events etc) so it hasn't been anywhere near possible for that happen just yet, but their response to the idea itself was very positive.

nl_Kripparrian,35ddmi,jw322,1 point,Sat May 9 08:17:28 2015 UTC,Does it not show how 'pros' are narrow minded and just shittalk on ALMOST all new cards. (they do that intentionally but I am sure some think card is good actually)
nl_Kripparrian,35ddmi,Dpslp16,-2,Sat May 9 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"hearthstone is a young game with people from video games new to card games. A few more rotations they will learn. A magic card named Tarmagoyf was sitting in bins for 50 cents at one point and now they worth like $500 each. Looking back, anyone should have seen its potential power for future formats."
nl_Kripparrian,35bhax,GoFYrself,33,Fri May 8 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"The admins message Kripp in his earpiece and say, ""stars don't matter.""  Kripp, being the non-hypocrite, non-sellout, and non-forsen-hater that he is, rips off both his earpiece and his shirt displaying his chiseled abs for the world to see.  ""I'm done with this money grubbing tournament and this casual game!  I have principlerinos!"" he yells in the middle of the stream.  Kripp then grabs the love of his life and rides off with her into the sunset.  Rania comes too.  Kripp, Rania, and Artosis then play PoE in the wilderness for the rest of their lives, and they are happy, because the game is so hardcore."
nl_Kripparrian,35bhax,Ndlovunkulu,6,Fri May 8 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"You answered your own question right there. He was there, he was following what the producers said, and probably can't say anything. Might be in his contract, might not.If not, he might be letting the tournament deal with the situation and before he gives out possible sensitive information.  None of this qualifies for hypocrite. He probably loves it but cannot say. Respect the man for not blurting everything out."
nl_Kripparrian,35bhax,infamouscheater,-16,Fri May 8 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"You're a fucking idiot.  Probably"", ""May-be"", ""Might"" are not definitive answers.  And there's a BIG difference between ""Kripp not being allowed to say something about ESL while casting an ESL tournament"", and ""Kripp never being allowed to say anything about ESL, because he casted an ESL tournament.""  He's a Youtuber/Streamer, so if he's signing contracts that effect what he can/can't say on his Twitch and YouTube channels, then he's even dumber than your comment.  Besides, if he couldn't say it because of his contract (which I already explain is HIGHLY doubtful), he would have just said so.  Finally, I don't give respect to a man for ""not blurting everything out"" when this is exactly the same type of topics (Hearthstone drama / controversy a la Hosty and MagicAmy) that he said just months prior that he LOVES.  Christmas has come early boys, ... oh, expect when it's my turn to start handing out the presents ... Kripp can be a fucking jackass sometimes."

nl_Kripparrian,35bhax,Ndlovunkulu,-2,Sat May 9 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"Ummm ... no, no and ummmm .... no?   Fact: Kripp made a video about Hosty. Fact: Kripp made a video about MagicAmy. Fact: Kripp stated that he loves talking about Hearthstone drama. Fact: Hearthstone drama occurred at ESL tournament. Fact: Kripp was on site and saw first hand the events of the ESL drama unfold. Fact: Kripp did not make a video about his favorite topic / Hearthstone drama for the ESL debacle.   The combination of these 7 facts makes Kripp a hypocrite in my eyes (although, I can see the potential for him being a sell out or just disliking Forsen as alternative explanations).  Since I'm making a statement based on the logical outcomes of known events/facts, this isn't conjecture.  Conjecture would be statements like ""May-be Kripp has explosive diarrhea, and he hasn't had time to  make a video."" or ""He can't say anything because of his contract."" Those types of statements are based on incomplete information ... but hey, this is reddit, I guess I should not expect that you understand the intricacies of making sound, logical arguments."

nl_Kripparrian,35b1rq,Ndlovunkulu,4,Fri May 8 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"Kripp allowing people to spam him with racist comments and people are annoyed. Its like racism is bad or something, or are you just 12 years old and think being racist is edgy and cool?"

nl_Kripparrian,35b1rq,Ndlovunkulu,0,Sat May 9 00:08:32 2015 UTC,You realise Kripp could even get banned from twitch if he let people openly be racist? You just used racism as an example of people whining on this reddit.
nl_Kripparrian,35b1rq,Seriouscatt,-2,Sat May 9 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"You're completely misrepresenting the post.  It's not about whether racism is ok or not.  It's about what the appropriate response to that racist was.  Kripp's choice to ignore them like the nobodies they are and quietly remove them later was probably the smarter option.  Reasonable people can disagree about that response, and if you guys approached it constructively with an intent to discuss the issue, I wouldn't have included it on my list of whining.  Instead, you guys would rather be drama queens and lament how Krippi was removed, pushing the ridiculous storyline that ""Kripp loves racists and money more than he lives Krippi.""  That's why it goes on the whining list.  If that takes away from my overarching point for you, there about 50 complaining posts I can replace it with."
nl_Kripparrian,35b1rq,Ndlovunkulu,1 point,Sat May 9 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"Kripp wouldnt have even noticed people messaging him with racist remarks. And since he wouldn't have said anything, others would think its okay. Kripp viewing audience in Hearthstone is much lower than any other game he has played, a lot of younger and more impressionable people watch his stream. If they see that Kripp doesn't care about people sending racist messages, they might think its okay. If people didn't tell Rania to tell Kripp to remove them, it wouldnt have been done."

Thats why his Youtube videos have gone up quite a bit in quality from his Canada days. Thats why he's always playing Hearthstone with that PJSalt persona as a font, it's what the majority of his viewers want. You can really just see the change for yourself by checking out his Youtube channel. The old Kripp spent 20 mins talking about an old shirt, made sarcastic videos about the no-life......life and honestly, there is a video out there where Kripp actually gets a bit upset for people donating money. THATS how much into gaming he was, money was very much an aftertought.  Dont get me wrong, i'm not saying Kripp has turned into some moneygrabbing Treasure Goblin....he's a businessman now and he's doing a damn fine job at that."

All he cares about is money and make excuses for everything, then calls us haters for calling him out on his hypocritical bullshit.  Last time I watched him play was when he struggled against rank 19 scrubs and lost 3 in a row. He whined and was salty the entire time.

He honestly thinks hes the only one who gets unlucky in HS ever, I've gotten way more unlucky then the times I've seen him, yet he topdecks all the time he just never remembers those.  Talking about how hes better then everyone cause hes been playing longer blah blah blah. After watching him talk about how easy it'd be to get Legend that he just doesnt want to yet I watch him miss lethal in ranked play twice only to lose the game afterwards was definitely one of the few highlights lately.  He plays gimmicky decks against nobodies on his friends list who suck at the game in friendlies that are just boring. If they weren't nobodies who didn't suck it might be more entertaining.  He plays NOTHING but MAGE, MAGE and Paladin Arenas 80% of the time now , I mean have some friggin fun and mix it up once in awhile instead of forever being a tryhard. When he was leveling up all the classes it was fun he actually did well with Shaman and other classes hes actually not that good with Mage its just hard to screw up Mage usually with 4 fireballs 3 Flamestrikes."

Considering the fact that he plays this game for X hours a day (not really sure how many exactly, but at least 5 from what I recall), he should be able to get legend within the first week or so. This is how long it takes players like Sjow, dog, StrifeCro, etc, and some of them play for less than 5 hours a day. But at the same time playing arena for the same amount of time with Mage/Paladin is not boring at all, because at least he gets to complain about how he gets fucked by RNG every time he loses..."

Kripp who went from 1 of the most tryhard of gamers shouldn´t be playing this game that is made for casuals.

Contributing pastas that Kripp's chat can spam is one of the greatest joys in my life, alongside spamming pastas in general.     Why does any pasta need to be spammed?  Because that is the purpose of pasta, and pasta is the purpose of Twitch Chat.  If one does not paste pastas, then one is missing out on the Twitch Chat Experience.   or you're spamming that message because you really feel your spam deserves to be seen and noticed, in which case just fuck off you special snowflake.

nl_Kripparrian,34xiq3,BestSingedHawai,20,Tue May 5 11:35:35 2015 UTC,Kripp is Canadian. That is where he belongs. When he returns to the homeland it means stream starts at a reasonable hour. Maybe Kripp will re-awaken as the hardcore gamer we all used to love...
nl_Kripparrian,34xiq3,ckilgannon,16,Tue May 5 11:50:20 2015 UTC,Kripp is romanian with a canadian citizenship that lives in Greece.

nl_Kripparrian,34piov,MileyCyrus8,35,Sun May 3 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Kripp doesn't play Constructed seriously because he is afraid to hurt his own ego. When he plays arena he can blame his losses on ""he topdecked it"", ""he has insane draft"", ""he got really lucky"", ""I didn't get a single flamestrike"" and so on. If he played constructed Kripp couldn't complain more than half of the things.He always says constructed takes no skill and isn't hard but somehow same top players (StrifeCro, Lifecoach, Firebat, Kolento) are always highly successful. There is skill involved you can't deny that, it's not easy to makes plays based on your opponents cards, your cards and possible draws 3-4 turns ahead, especially in unforgiving game like hearthstone where you lose almost instantly because of high damage combos and and small life pools.  What i see happening is Kripp struggling at rank 5-1 for a long time, refusing to admit that he's making wrong plays, playing wrong deck, playing wrong cards and etc."
nl_Kripparrian,34piov,towerbrah,6,Sun May 3 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"its a big step from playing at rank5 to someone close to kolento. the diffrence is huge. i dont see myself having too much fun playing at rank 3+  with decks i did more or less copy from others or having a close to 50 % winrate. and its hard to make a deck of your own or like kolento and other pros get decklists, or deckideas from other player."
nl_Kripparrian,34piov,yeahwhatsuplol,4,Sun May 3 12:46:53 2015 UTC,I agree. I do also think it would be cool as fuck for Kripp to tryhard and get legend. We all know he is capable but to actually see him do it would be wonderful. Imagine a 3 day tryhard stream marathon. Kreygasm
nl_Kripparrian,34piov,Whampus,0,Mon May 4 06:10:14 2015 UTC,"Why couldn't you use all of those excuses in constructed? Lol. Getting insane top dicks is still a think, as are the insane decks... And it isn't like constructed doesn't have awesome RNG elements."
nl_Kripparrian,34piov,TheTempleKnight,-7,Tue May 5 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Might be.  Might also be that constructed doesn't do shit for your collection and account progress at all  Why waste all this time grinding for legend when it doesn't mean shit? Kripp won't be competing for Blizzcon,so reaching legend is absolutely pointless.Arena on the other hand yields a pack every time and the collection will always improve,no matter what.I totally get why Kripp doesn't play constructed that much,i'm pretty much the same.Sometimes i wanna play some sweet combos and play a little bit constructed here and there but 80% of the time i just play arena because after a run i get at least something for the time i've put into it."
nl_Kripparrian,34piov,NaturalBornChilla,-1,Mon May 4 03:32:35 2015 UTC,"Might also be that constructed doesn't do shit for your collection and account progress at all   Kripp makes gold in arena every day and probably has enough dust to craft every viable card in golden. He also has all the cards and every class at 60. What possible 'account progression' can Kripp even get at this point? And why would Kripp care about that over the enjoyment he gets out of it?  Heck, even if you think about it strictly in terms of account progression, he should play constructed because one of the only things he hasn't gotten yet is a golden hero."

At that point, he somehow got the idea that stars would determine the winner if the top two were the same rank, instead of there being some other tie breaker.  Pretty logical, right?  Then, later, he seemed to come to believe that it was entirely rank so he may as well try to hit Rank 3.  Basically, if the rules had been clear from the start, Forsen's last four(or however many) hours might have been handled differently.   There's a really good chance he could have won outright."

nl_Kripparrian,34mzxu,Landmarkmoon,5,Sat May 2 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Forsen was ahead by quite a large margin and decided to stay put on his current rank, but the casters(pretty sure it was Kripp, but it's not really relevant anymore as i've now been told he was told so by admins) told him individual stars didnt matter, it was purely based on rank, so Forsen played on to try and get 1 higher rank to secure the win. Later turned out stars DID matter, and Forsen lost 4 or so after that and drew with Savjz. Basically Forsen got cheated out of a tournament win."

nl_Kripparrian,34mzxu,interstat,2,Sat May 2 21:10:42 2015 UTC,If your point of watching the whole 24 hours of the tournament was to see who won in the end then yes I guess it must have been a disappointment. For most others it was a pretty entertaining tournament allthrough thanks to the casters.  The mess with the rules in the end was bad but not bad enough to say that the tournament itself was disappointing.
nl_Kripparrian,34mzxu,robotdonny,1 point,Sat May 2 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"It seems like sometimes people are too eager to jump to conclusions without actually giving it some thought. There was a miscommunication regarding the ruleset. Out of all possible scenarios, it happened and this specific case took place, so it caused some issues. Everything else up to that point was perfectly fine. It was a very unusual event, give it some credit for that and try to realize that things can go wrong without this implying bad intentions."

Did he not look at chat once the entire time? People on his friends list messaged him things and he said nothing, just ignored it, but when other friends messaged him about other things he responded immediately. So it's not like he wasn't paying attention to the messages on screen.   Not only is Kripp representing himself now but the TSM brand as well. He did nothing to take control of the situation. It wasn't until Leifman stepped in that things stopped. It was pretty disgusting and disappointing to watch."
nl_Kripparrian,34dq4r,sionofdarkness,7,Thu Apr 30 19:24:47 2015 UTC,Adding random people isn't helping the stream in any way. You really should just avoid it all together. No one enjoys seeing these idiots spam chat all day.

I know in WoW he added guild members and other top people on the realm, in D3/POE he added Mumble bros, people that he played with, top people on Ladder etc. Actually even in early HS days he added well known streamers and high rank Legend players."
nl_Kripparrian,34dq4r,drewson87,21,Thu Apr 30 15:13:52 2015 UTC,"He's sponsored by a website called Pro Gaming League (PGL). He promotes it every stream by telling his fans to sign up to the site so they can play on the ladder and potentially win money, as well as getting to play against Kripp on stream. He dedicates at least 2-3 hours each stream (sometimes over half his stream) to playing against the viewers that signed up to this site. The site has a queue system that matches players up with others who are also online. Kripp gets the battletags of these fanboys of his and puts them onto his BNet friends list so he can play against them.  So basically, the people on his friends list these days are just random fanboys who signed up to that PGL website. A lot of them are just annoying, immature trolls (like Poetic aka Hearthpoe aka robotdonny) who spam Kripp with stupid shit memes in-game, so that chat starts spamming their memes and give them attention. Kripp deleted all of his actual Hearthstone ""friends"" (including his real life buddy, Krippi) just to make room for these random retards. It's yet another example of how far Kripp has sunk in his quest to become the very thing he used to mock, despise, and make fun of: a casual sellout."

He refused to pick Mage no matter what. That lasted for the first few months he played Hearthstone...   When he fully sold out and went full casual, he no longer cared what people thought about his oldschool, rebel, hardcore persona. He started to pick Mage every chance he got (the complete opposite of what he criticized harshly and mocked). If Mage isn't available, he usually goes with Paladin or Druid... the other classes that gets him the most wins in arena.  Kripp always whines whenever he has to face a Mage in arena, even if he himself is also playing as a Mage. He's a hypocrite crybaby that always needs to make excuses for his losses. He's now whining about having to face so many Paladins in arena, even though Pally is his 2nd most-picked class. Basically, nobody should be allowed to pick the most OP classes except for him. And if he gets owned, it's always because of his bad RNG, bad luck, and/or others getting super lucky."

He didn't play it on the pretense of it being ""too easy"", because mage does have very powerful cards and also the best hero power in arena.  Up until recently his policy on hunter has been ""it's shit because you need the right cards"", even well into the release of GvG.  Now he seems to attribute it to hunter being too inconsistent - no matter your draw you can usually rush your opponent down for an easy 7 wins, but getting 12 wins isn't too common for hunter."
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,ConradBHart42,-5,Fri May 1 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"I belive it was after Naxx. When he was leveling up every class to 60 he chose to do mage last because he found it boring and a bit overpowered, and at the time Mage was by far both the strongest and the easiest class to play.  It is still the easiest class to play (and the most boring non-interactive class, flamestrike,flamecannon,polymorph,fireball all speak for themselves), but it's definitely not the strongest class atm.   It also fits the playstyle that he prefers because he likes controlly/greedy type of games, and mage is perfect for that since it can reward greedy plays very easily thanks to powerful AoE.  So yeah, basically it fits his playstyle. It's not the strongest class but the hero power and aoe/removal stuffs allows for greedy plays a lot more than with other classes."
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,HufferNudes,9,Wed Apr 29 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"One of the very few times I've disagreed with you dude, Mage is by far the easiest and best arena class."
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,MileyCyrus8,-6,Wed Apr 29 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"Easiest yes, best no. Find me an infinite arena streamer who says mage is the strongest/best class in arena.  adwcta will soon prove me semi-wrong though, because it's supposedly , according to him equal between mages and paladins right now in terms on winrate. I referred to him but I almost refuse to belive that mage is even in the top 2. But if i'm wrong then i'm wrong, according to him and his statistics mages are on par with Paladins in terms of winrate atm.   I would barely even put mage in top 3 right now, would probably put it in 4th place in terms of strenght/winrate. (dont mix up winrate with popularity of the class)"
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,HufferNudes,-11,Thu Apr 30 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, too, that ADWCTA's stats include skilled and unskilled players. Skilled players can make some classes work that unskilled players cannot. Isn't it Massan who thinks that Rogue is one of the strongest classes, mainly because he's skilled enough with the class to make it work. Most players are not skilled with the class, thus the average winrate for Rogue will suffer.  tl;dr Classes that are really strong in the hands of skilled players will have average winrates that suffer due to unskilled players being represented in the statistics."
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,robotdonny,2,Thu Apr 30 03:38:18 2015 UTC,Heartharena's stats usually show the difference between what works for infinite arena players and players with lower winrates.

Tell me one infinite arena streamer who would say mage is the strongest in arena now and i'll suck your dick for an eternity."

You might want to know what they all say before you offer that eternity of dick-sucking."
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,nu2readit,-3,Thu Apr 30 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"I watch them all. You don't even have to ask Ratsmah since his ranking of classes are written under his FAQ on his stream. Hafu has said multiple times she thinks paladin is the strongest. Ekop and massan aren't really arenastreamers but I know massan has said himself that his strongest class in arena is Rogue.   So yeah, I know a lot of infinite streamers who has said on multiple occations that paladin is the strongest class in arena right now. My question is which infinite arenastreamer do you know who claims Mage to be the strongest class in arena?"
nl_Kripparrian,34asn2,HufferNudes,-12,Thu Apr 30 13:18:57 2015 UTC,"If Mage is the MOST picked class, it is unsurprising that it's the class appearing most often at each of those win levels.  I'm making up numbers here ... but ... let's say the avg winrate for Warlock is 9 wins ... and the avg winrate for Mage is 7 wins. If Mage is chosen three times as much as Warlock, it's still going to appear at the top of all those winrates in that graphic. That graphic says nothing about the relative strength of any class, just its popularity.  Average wins per class would be the more revealing statistic."

Then you had to go and lie to him about not using Skype anymore. You really think Krippi would get your IP and DDoS you or give it to someone who would? Fucking ridiculous man.

Kripp then modded me around the time he started to stream Hearthstone and needed more / better mods to keep his chat from getting owned (most of his newfound Hearthstone fanboys back then were much more cancerous than they are today). I was mod for about 2-3 months... until I stopped watching him stream PoE and Hearthstone. He demodded me and most of his older (troll) mods (except Hearthpoe and Leifman), who stopped watching Kripp after he sold out and became a casual, after he moved in with Rania.

He knows his viewers and subs get a kick out of being on his friendslist and making jokes from time to time and perhaps he enjoys it as well. So in an effort to be more engaging with his audience he finds room for as many people on his friendslist as possible.  I was watching Krippi when he was talking about this and he wasn't nearly as upset about it as this thread would lead people to believe. This thread is simply uninvolved people making a mountain out of a mole hill.  Why would actual irl friends of Kripp care that much about his internet contact list? If anything blame blizzard for having a limit of 100 people.

nl_Kripparrian,3450wc,MileyCyrus8,5,Tue Apr 28 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Salt (sodium chloride) has always been an essential element required for humans to survive. 96.5% of this world's water contains salt... and water makes up for 70%+ of this world's surface. Salt can be found in our blood, our tears, and our sweat. Salt is everywhere.  Jesus told his disciples that they are the salt of the earth. He said this because salt is extremely important and valuable, especially back in the day at the time Jesus lived, before we could mass produce it at factories and before we had refrigerators to prevent food from spoiling.   There are many reasons why Jesus said that Christians are the salt of the earth and used salt as a metaphor (among many) to describe his disciples and all Christians. Salt was used both as a preservative and to flavor food. Jesus meant that Christians are to preserve the goodness of this world and to prevent evil from spoiling everything. He also meant that Christians are to provide flavor and meaning to life in this world, sharing the Word of God with everyone.   What Jesus meant when he warned to not lose saltiness is that if Christians lost their purity and saltiness, they would become useless to this world. Contaminated salt becomes useless and is as valuable as sand on the beach.   I know you made this thread as a joke. Kripp and most of his fans, along with the brainwashed masses of this world, would never understand the true meaning of this and other Bible verses that contains the word salt. Most people these days use salt and saltiness to symbolize someone crying or being full of resentment and being annoyed."

nl_Kripparrian,34094k,Cakeorrdeath,-11,Tue Apr 28 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Nope, he sold his soul for money and hardcore Kripp has been long dead. What you saw on stream today was yet another day where he made excuses to not play every game other than Hearthstone and badmouth every developer that isn't named Blizzard. He continued to lie and tell half-truths about his experiences in these games. He won't ever come onto this subreddit of his and debate me or any of his critics because he knows that we're 100% right about him being a casual sellout who only plays Hearthstone for the money. He's a coward who can only talk shit on stream or in his YouTube videos, without anyone to respond to him or set the record straight.   It disgusts me to hear him bash Guild Wars 2 and talk shit about ANet yet again. This is like the 6th time I've heard him lie and tell half-truths about his experience in GW2. They banned him because he streamed exploits to thousands of viewers. If he or any popular streamer did this in ANY game, they would've permabanned his ass. Instead, they only gave him a 3 day suspension... Which ironically, Kripp admits he was suspended in WoW many times for exploiting. ANet are evil dbags for doing it to him in their game, but Blizzard's cool and has amazing ""game support"" for doing it to him and his exploiting guild in WoW. Hypocrite much, Kripp?   Oh, and Kripp failed to once again mention the fact that everyone in Mumble, including me and Krippi, told him that he'd be banned if he streamed the exploits on stream. We told him not to do it and he still did. His exact words to us was: ""Whatever, it'll be funny."" He'll never mention this part though, because it doesn't fit his narrative that he was supposedly unfairly targeted and suspended by ANet.  He once again, complains about Neverwinter being pay to win and that the devs once again, unfairly banned him for exploiting their game multiple times in front of thousands of people. Yes, Neverwinter had tons of exploits and I admit Perfect World / Cryptic Studios are run by a bunch of money-hungry idiots. However, Kripp once again fails to mention that most of the people who exploited the auction house were permabanned. I know because I was mad about it back then and witnessed a lot of people I knew in the game get permabanned for being dumbasses. I never got suspended nor banned in Neverwinter because I was never dumb enough to blatantly exploit something I knew they would be able to track and catch.   I also had all of the best gear in the game and destroyed everyone in PvP without paying a single cent to Perfect World / Cryptic, so there goes his pay to win excuse. He admitted again that Neverwinter had the best ""system"" of any MMO, on par with his favorite MMO of all time: Dark Age of Camelot. Yet he quit the game after only playing it for 2 weeks because of some auction house exploit that was dealt with.   The rest of the stream, he spends making more excuses as to why he doesn't revisit games and why he doesn't play other games. I honestly can't take anything Kripp says seriously anymore. All he does is make excuses and talk shit about games he's hardly played or never played. He's literally worse than IGN or Gamespot reviewers who review games after only playing it for a few hours. At least they tell you their reviews are based on beta and sometimes, they'll go back to re-review a game after it's had multiple patches and expansions.  He blames every developer for doing the right thing and suspending / banning him for being a blatant cheater in every game he plays, while showing thousands of people exactly how he cheated so they can do the same thing and tell their friends how to do it. Meanwhile, he spams Hearthstone all day, everyday, and pretends he still loves the game and has fun playing it, when everyone can see he's lying through his teeth. He then calls us haters because we dare speak out and criticize him for being a casual sellout, him lying on stream, and tell the truth about what actually happened."

nl_Kripparrian,33wzwc,fawcan,27,Sun Apr 26 13:04:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, he went hardcore in sound quality...   What Kripp is using now is called an in-ear monitor (IEM). The name of the IEM he got from Logitech is called Ultimate Ears UE900. It's a somewhat high-end IEM which contains 4 balanced armature drivers in each ear. These drivers deliver precise and clear sound that no gaming headset could ever dream of reproducing. The only things that can match or beat the UE900 in terms of sound quality are other high-end universal IEMs (Shure SE535, Shure SE846, Sennheiser IE800, etc.) custom IEMs which can cost up to $2,000+ (Google Noble K10), and other hi-fi audiophile-grade headphones. Here's a good list of reviews of IEMs: www.head-fi.org/t/478568  UE900 sounds amazing for the price, but it has a design flaw and will break eventually on Kripp unless he babies it. Even if he babies the thing, I think it will still break, just from normal everyday wear and tear. Unacceptable for an IEM that originally costed $400 (I got mine for $190 when Logitech decided to discontinue making them and put them on clearance last May). I believe they said this problem was fixed on the newer model called UE900S, but people have reported that even the new model can break easily as well. I still have UE Triple Fi 10 (and many other IEMs and headphones) but sold the UE900 because I was afraid it'll eventually break on me and Logitech won't be able to cover the warranty in a few years.  I knew exactly what Kripp got the second he showed it on stream because I used to own the same IEM. I was surprised to see Kripp get them because he's always used crappy gaming headsets for years. It was funny watching and hearing his reaction to what the UE900 could do. He was like ""I'm hearing things I never did before. It's kinda freaking me out."" The even funnier thing is, he's wasting UE900's capabilities on listening to Hearthstone's repetitive soundtrack for 8+ hours a day. I would never use a high-end IEM for that purpose. They're made for listening to lossless FLAC music files, watching TV shows / movies, and playing games with actual positional sound (like FPSs) or good soundstracks.  Kripp got it for free because he's sponsored by Logitech. Logitech bought out Ultimate Ears about 7 years ago. Ultimate Ears still produces custom IEMs for musicians and audiophiles, but Logitech basically killed UE's consumer market for some stupid reason. They discontinued all of their non-custom IEM models about a year ago. I have no clue why Logitech sent Kripp the UE900 to promote on-stream, since they discontinued it and only sells the UE900S for $400, which I doubt most of Kripp's younger fans could afford, nor do most of Kripp's viewers have a clue wtf these things are. Oh well, like Kripp said, he gets free shit from his sponsors, so why not use them?   P.S. Rest in Pepperonis Hardcore Green Razer Headset w/ Gunnars Kripp. You will be missed.

I love it for the microdetails it can deliver, but I don't like the sound signature much. Like you said, the cable for it sucks balls and you gotta replace it eventually. Ultimate Ears' consumer IEMs just aren't built to last. I've wanted to get mine reshelled but don't feel like paying hundreds for a sound signature I don't fully enjoy or going through the hassle of getting ear impressions done and refitted over and over. Maybe one day...  I now have a nice headphone setup that I'm satisfied with for FLAC, TV/movies, and gaming: Sennheiser HD700 + Meridian Explorer² DAC/amp + Schiit Vali amp. I'll always use IEMs for when I go outside, but when I'm at my desktop, I usually like using headphones for their superior soundstage and resolution / imaging.

nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,HomicidalPhilosopher,-6,Sun Apr 26 08:53:36 2015 UTC,"Serious question: why do people keep asking kripp to change game? you know how much money he makes playing hearthstone compared to other games? i know he might have passion for other games, but its all about the money. he would stare at paint dry if he got the same amount of money/viewers compared to other games. No joke. People here are a vocal miniority, the casual fanbase gives kripp his money, and he has to please them."
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,Letzor,8,Sat Apr 25 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"It's not about changing games completely. Kripp should play different games from time to time for his own sanity and to salvage what's left of his once-glorious reputation.   You can tell he's super burnt out on Hearthstone and as a result, is always whiny, salty, and complaining about the game. He's improved the past week or so, but that's because he's getting sick of the criticism he's been getting on reddit, his peers making fun of him to his face, live on stream in Germany, and people spamming his chat everytime he acts like a 12 year old child. Rania has been trying to calm him down and remind him to stop whining, whenever he starts to cry like a baby.  Kripp has already been sold out for over a year. He's already made tons of money. Kripp is just greedy and wants more. He doesn't need to stream Hearthstone exclusively every stream, everyday, every week, every month, month after month. But he chooses to do so due to his greed and love of money. He's cashing in on Hearthstone hype for as long as possible.  What Kripp's ignorant Hearthstone fanboys don't understand is, oldschool fans like me criticize him because we want him to be better than just another popular sellout streamer who only cares about money and to be more like what he was once known for: hardcore gaming, having fun, being the best at the games he plays. Most of his critics here are not asking Kripp to completely switch games and ditch Hearthstone (he would never do that anyway). We just want him to switch things up a bit and mix in games he actually enjoys playing a few times a month. Kripp used to mix in different games into his primary gaming schedule... before he completely sold out. It's not like what we're asking and hoping for is something Kripp has never done before."
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,C_L_I_C_K,5,Sat Apr 25 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"I see where youre coming from as a hardcore fan, iam not, i have been following him from time to time though, and for the last couple of weeks he has peaked over 30k viewers and sustained them. its insane, here is an example. Destiny a streamer who sits at around 2-3k viewers recently came out with how much money he makes. With that viewercount he makes around 90k-100k !!! a year, compare that to kripp, iam not saying he is a filthy rich, but rich enough that rania, a scientist with a phd and many years experience wants to quit here job, and become his personal manager.  I fully understand that as a hardcore fan, you want him to go back, but sadly i cant seem him do that if he keeps that viewercount and frankly i dont blame him."
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,Letzor,4,Sat Apr 25 23:49:26 2015 UTC,"What most of Kripp's fans (oldschool and new) doesn't realize is that Kripp has been making over 6 figures since he blew up in Diablo 3 days. He's been making crazy money from YouTube sponsorships for years. Twitch used to be a small fraction of his income until he blew up in popularity in Hearthstone. He pretended to be poor, wearing ripped up t-shirt and looking like a bum, because he was lazy and because he was trying to play up his hardcore, couldn't care about anything but gaming persona back in the day. He lived with his dad because he was a cheap bastard. He could've easily afforded a nice apartment by himself in Toronto, even before he completely sold out.  Most people regard Lirik as the most successful streamer on Twitch. While that's true and Lirik is most likely a millionaire by now (he makes over $25,000 / month just from subs, a lot more from donations and ad revenue), Kripp isn't far behind him in terms of monetary success, due to the fact that Kripp is also a very successful YouTuber with daily videos, while Lirik rarely does YouTube videos.  All of that to say, Kripp doesn't need to stream Hearthstone exclusively and maintain his 20-30k viewership numbers everyday to be financially well-off. This is my point. He chooses to remain an exclusive Hearthstone streamer because of his greed. He can stream any game he wants a few days every month, and it won't hurt him at all. He refuses to do it though because he wants maximum profits and will keep spamming Hearthstone, even if it costs him his reputation, his dignity, a large portion of his true hardcore fans, and the joy he once had for games. It's just sad to see him devolve to the same type of streamer he used to mock and look down upon, before he sold out and went full casual."
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,C_L_I_C_K,3,Sun Apr 26 00:23:25 2015 UTC,"you seem to conclude my first question about peoples perception of kripp in this sub, as if they truly didnt know why he only streamed hearthstone. i agree he could easily stream other games for a week each month, but he decides not to for greed and more money. he is probably planning getting married and having children, and thus need money to support them. question is really if he really needs anymore money, but who knows? oh well i feel bad for his hardcore fans, but atleast you know the reason why he went full casual. its all about the $$$"
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,Letzor,0,Sun Apr 26 01:01:09 2015 UTC,"The thing about greed is, it's never enough. Rich people always want to be richer.   He's obviously saving up to buy a house, get married, and save up to raise kids. He can do all of that without exclusively streaming Hearthstone and be a total casual sellout. He could easily add different games into his rotation and actually have fun playing games for a living again, while still making bank. He just chooses not to."

nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,Jtmarino,2,Sun Apr 26 06:16:50 2015 UTC,"But do you think he can actually do that?  Kripps biggest quality was always his perseverance, he would try/rethink/redo things for crazy hours. If he only does that from time to time, can he do the same? I don't think he so. His old style is pretty time demanding."
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,teerre,5,Sun Apr 26 00:04:59 2015 UTC,"I fully understand and accept the fact that the old, hardcore Kripp has been dead for over a year and will most likely never come back. He cares way too much about money now to revert back to his former hardcore self. Plus, I doubt Rania would be happy with him streaming for 18+ hours everyday for an entire week like he used to.   The only way he'll ever go back to being a hardcore gamer is when Hearthstone loses its popularity and he switches to another super-hyped up game that can sustain at least 20k viewers everyday and requires him to play it hardcore in order to be successful at. Even then, I doubt Kripp will ever be as hardcore as he once was because he's lost the drive and desire to be the best at every game he plays.  I'm just hoping he plays other games a few hours each week to add a bit of variety into his stream and regain some of the joy he once had for playing games. It isn't too much to ask of him, but his stubborness and greed is preventing him from seeing the benefits in doing that.   It'd also be nice if he'd stop criticizing and badmouthing games and their developers he refuses to play or give a fair chance; when the real reason he won't play these games is his own greed and ignorance. He also keeps teasing that he wants to play so and so game, but never does."
nl_Kripparrian,33uaan,C_L_I_C_K,4,Sun Apr 26 00:41:25 2015 UTC,Kripp would have never gotten this big without his hardcore fans who supported him since wow diablo and poe... noone would watch him play hearthstone if he didn't have had his old fanbase
nl_Kripparrian,33ybng,hmmnotsure,2,Sun Apr 26 20:17:31 2015 UTC,I don't have a problem with Kripp playing whatever game he wants to play I just wish he would be a bit more competitive and try to get legend or better yet make a new(ish) deck and get legend with it (and not just change 2-3 cards and call it a new deck).

He (+rania) spends a crapton of time dealing with sponsorships, answering messages, making youtube content every single day. He probably ""works""/spends 12-14~ hours a day (depend on how you want to look at it) providing all of this content/streaming.  The games vs Helten are not to make himself feel better I think, but that he enjoys playing a creative gimmickdeck vs another creative gimmickdeck (and Helten is really good at making those gimmickdecks aswell) Chat hates it from what i've seen, but he still does it. Why? Cause he thinks it's fun.  He stoped the e-bettle sponsorship even if it might of been a questionable decision in the first place, he did listen to the crowd and ended it, I dont really understand how someone can hold one mistake against someone for this long  He does complain a lot in hearthstone, and sometimes a bit too much yes, but fairly understandable when he spends 8 hour a day playing a game that has a lot of RNG involved."

That actually hasn't been very long, so it's expected people are still salty about it. I'm glad he dropped them.  What a lot of people don't mention is the fact that Kripp doesn't clutter up his stream with all that sub goal and sponsorship trash. Kripp is the only big streamer I know that keeps his stream clean, and it's one of the reasons why I continue to watch him.
