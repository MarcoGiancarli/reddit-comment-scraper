videogamedunkey,3ddsse,MisterKlaw,6,Wed Jul 15 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine his Dunkview of Rocket League will be like the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater video. Both games are very similar, no tutorials (there are tutorials but aren't very necessary to learn the game) or bloated features, just jump into the game and have fun. It'll be interesting to see what kind of twist he'll throw onto it from there.  By the way, Rocket League is so much fun for $20 (or free if you have PS+). The multiplayer servers have gone under a lot of strain which have irritated some players, but the season mode is still fun to play. I haven't played a simple yet addicting game like this in a while, it'll be a struggle for me to put the controller down."

Don't get me wrong ma man, I love this video and laughed my ass off, but after watching it the 5th time I just have to point out some slip ups:   00:09: You can see a sliver of the original captcha behind your overlay at the left side. 00:33: The Word ""salad"" and the picture of the salad behind your overlay can be seen after you scroll down a bit. 00:51: The ""solve media"" icon seems to be cut off at the top. Assuming you cropped a bit to much out.   Now I never ever noticed some obvious slip ups in your video as I watch them multiple times. Maybe you were just in a hurry to deliver us some great content, again and again. Maybe I'm a prick and should shut up. But all I want is for you to not feel pressured to deliver videos on time. If it takes some time so be it. Fucking love the stuff you made dunk."

videogamedunkey,3daha9,OutOfCare,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:25 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I just never saw editing errors obvious as these in his Videos. Maybe this time he wanted us to notice. Maybe I'm putting again too much thought into this.

No. I wouldn't call it copying either but the influence is there. I don't understand this whole argument of him being a copycat either but I don't care, I don't want this doodoo dick risking Dunk's channel growth with drama.  The entire argument aside, I honestly can't enjoy Keyori's videos because the guy just seems like an obnoxious adolescent in his exterior, I don't know what it is but I just can't watch his videos, when my friend forced me to watch a video I had to skip to the important parts to shut him up. His style of commentary has been done to death and I'd say Dunkey always keeps it fresh because of his deadpan humor with multiple layered indirect sarcasm, he's really a comedy genius."

Be yourself, it's a cliche because it's true, ya know. Don't steal jokes 'n' shit that people thought of themselves, that ain't rad.

To me, it was a huge waste of pretty much everyone's time. /r/AMA was the only subreddit that had a REAL reason to protest.

videogamedunkey,3c3tnc,mcshmeggy,9,Sat Jul 4 16:14:59 2015 UTC,I can definitely see the difference between his old and new league vids but I think his non league stuff is still always 10/10.
videogamedunkey,3c3tnc,JojyAndPeen,17,Sat Jul 4 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"youtubers change, dunkey started doing this for fun, but now its become a job. He earns money from making youtube videos, so he has to try and be funny.  I love dunkey, his old and new stuff, i do understand what you are saying. Not every video is a 10/10, some are 9/10. For example, Operation Teemo and Slam dunkey are fucking amazing, and bruzer zin zow. I dont really know where im going with this, i completely lost track half way through but i guess what im trying to say is that because there is a higher demand for videos, he may have to rush them nd shit.  now im not trying to say his videos are bad, nonono. just that they are not 10/10, but 9/10.  im sorry if i didnt make sense im half asleep and ill."
videogamedunkey,3c3tnc,OmniJu,-9,Sat Jul 4 15:30:43 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying. I'm just disappointed that just because Dunkey got really popular he had to make a bunch of videos that appeal to 10 year olds.
videogamedunkey,3c3tnc,CJ101X,6,Sat Jul 4 19:29:42 2015 UTC,Something tells me 10 year olds don't watch dunkey. I think that something is the countless references he makes to games that were around many years before 10 year-olds were born. Just my 2 cents.
videogamedunkey,3c3tnc,eyeofnoble,-9,Sun Jul 5 00:24:28 2015 UTC,I'm saying that he uses constant yelling for humour more often which appeals more to younger viewers (take PewDiePie for example) instead of actually being funny.

But not in a bad way not at all, he videos now have a higher production value because over the years he has became a lot better at editing, and I honestly have no problem with his voice its the same ol' dunk voice but deeper. Also with all the new games coming out its giving dunkey way more material. I can't wait for dunkeys video on fallout 4 for instance, because I know he will make a fantastic and funny video based on the game.  And the point saying that dunkey has became Pewdiepie is just nonsense, dunkey might shout and scream but that doesn't instantly relate him to that unfunny mess does it? His jokes are thought through and have an intelligent twist to them most of the time."

I think donko was poking at the ""c o p y o r i"" circle jerk in the same way he does with a lot of stuff (that is, being pissed off to the point where it's not only funny but obviously satirical).

videogamedunkey,3abtmd,henryuuk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:01:03 2015 UTC,Saying 'whoops' already means you accept its your fault.
videogamedunkey,3abtmd,Zix117,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:18:03 2015 UTC,I was paraphrasing based on memory. I didn't get the impression at the time that he cared even a little.
videogamedunkey,3abtmd,henryuuk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"So you changed your entire opinion on someone based on a situation you didn't (have a way too) understand ? Kinda weird you are a fan of Dunkey then, pretty sure you could find dozens upon dozens of things to take up badly in his videos. Every time he 'insults' a different youtuber is pretty much him being an asshole and not caring."
videogamedunkey,3abtmd,Zix117,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"Dunkey has rarely, if ever, shown what he's like in normal, day-to-day life. Because of that, it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt when he makes fun of someone or something and assume he's just joking, because he usually is. I always thought Phil seemed a little smug, but it never bothered me much until I saw that on twitter. That made me kinda lose respect for him and not be so willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. To be fair, I've never met him in real life, and he might be a perfectly good person, but I have a harder time enjoying videos he's in now."
videogamedunkey,3abtmd,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"Dunno, seems like a double standard. So people that hide their true colors are now considered 'better' (when it comes to giving them the benefit of the doubt) then people that are open about their flaws, and in the case of Phil, have admitted too, and worked on, his flaws ?    So you'd pretty much put more faith into someone who is anonymous then someone who is open ?    Seems weird to me, but whatever, to each his own I guess"
videogamedunkey,3abtmd,Zix117,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:52:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd say that. I think it's not hard to get a sense of who Dunkey is based on his videos and the occasional personal stuff he's done. Without directly knowing him, it's easy to project personality traits and beliefs onto him based on what we do know about him. That kind of goes for most YouTubers, celebrities, etc. as well. Until Dunkey says or does something that makes me feel I'm wrong, I'm perfectly happy to assume he just likes to make jokes and does funny videos that I enjoy.  Even when I really liked Phil and watched most of his videos, I got the sense that he was kind of selfish and a little smug. Like I said, I wasn't too bothered by it initially, but after the tweets he made, I started feeling like those traits were more of his personality than I had originally assumed. That made him harder to watch in most videos, for me personally.   I don't think I'd outright say Dunkey is a better person than Phil or anything like that, because I've never met either of them, nor do I know a ton about who they are as people. However, based on the information I do have, I like Dunkey and his videos a lot more. Also there is the argument that Dunkey's videos can easily be taken as one off jokes that he came up with. He pretty much plays the same character in all of them, but his personality isn't necessarily influencing them directly. Phil's videos are pretty much based entirely on his personality. If Dunkey did or said something that really bothered me, I could probably ignore it while watching his videos, because they're just entertainment. Now that Phil has done that, I have a hard time enjoying videos he's in because it is very clearly him, being himself in them.  Basically, short version: I don't know if Phil is actually a bad person, but the impression I have of him leans that way, and I can't really enjoy his videos the way I used to. Not to say no one should, or they're wrong for liking him, but I don't like him so much anymore.  Also, that was much longer than I thought it'd be lol."

Like i know ""not even close baby"" is one of his signature jokes, but it really is amazing how often he gets away. As long as you can see his health bar, you've got the whole joke right there. The rest is just that he's constantly saying bullshit.  Super Irelia is one of my favorites now. Obviously the fake super hero names he makes up have nothing to do with the champions he's showing.

Stanley Kubrick makes some of the most mind-bendingly fucked up and often brutal movies out there, if you're looking for intellectually unsettling things, often in subtle ways.  If Stanely Kubrick made The Terminator, it'd be a monumentally fucked up, brutal, creepy, xenocidal movie, instead of a kickass action flick.  It already has some pretty cool backstory of the machines in the future trying to wipe out the last of human resistance by sending assassin robots back in time to kill their leader before he even starts the resistance.  Now imagine if the guy who made A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and 2001: A Space Odyssey were the director for that movie instead.  Guarantee you'd be depressed about the future of technology and the human race after watching that.  Dunkz is saying he'd be that Terminator."

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed horses. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. You didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo."

videogamedunkey,38e4ex,Negred,17,Thu Jun 4 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"HI Leah!! It was fantastic getting to meet you two. It seriously made my day. I couldn't really talk for long anyways since I was still working so it's ok. Maybe someday but still I wouldn't want to bother you guys too much since you already have a ton of fans. Ya it does get very hot but I just kinda deal with it and that is that haha. Sorry if I seemed a bit weird, I was pretty overwhelmed by the whole experience. Again you and Dunkey are amazing and just keep on being yourselves. :)"

videogamedunkey,38e4ex,AlmightyBunt,6,Wed Jun 3 21:10:53 2015 UTC,Nah I wasn't scared of getting caught. Its fine for me to stop for a second and take a picture with guests depending on where I am. I was just overwhelmed with excitement that I actually got to see them in person. It was unreal.

I was at greeter when Leah walked up first and then Dunkey and I asked him if he was actually Dunkey, and bam he was. He is very much approachable. Yes asking for a photo was pretty easy for me, as this was the very last thing I ever expected to happen. He even shook my hand and said it was nice to meet me! I do not recall any smells as I was shocked by pure excitement haha."
videogamedunkey,38e4ex,ZebraRT,2,Wed Jun 3 22:24:30 2015 UTC,Is Leahs voice really that cartoonish? I know its high pitched but it sounds alittle exaggerated

My wishlist for the game would be, in order:   tight controls, reminiscent of the original 4 games solid multiplayer support arcade style objectives and play (don't overdo a story and no gimmicks like BMX missions) fully featured park editor a sense of humor. I'd rather be a gorilla doing a 900 triple backflip over a T-rex than have some realistic boring aesthetic plenty of unlockables and easter eggs   Don't really care about graphics or fancy extras.

I love the silliness of the games, it keeps that playful nature of the series in tact.  Same with the graphics, Reddit got all pissy because the graphics didn't look hyper-realistic from the screenshots we've seen, but seriously, who gives a shit on how well the game looks? It's all about the gameplay, but rest assured the gameplay is gonna be great."

videogamedunkey,36s2es,Fabzzz,127,Thu May 21 17:48:57 2015 UTC,He's just trying to appear self-deprecating in order to mask his shame. Same thing with most of the youtubers that commented on Final Boss.
videogamedunkey,36s2es,SarcasticLizard,96,Thu May 21 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the guy is probably way too successful to care about this. I mean, he doesn't even allow comments on his videos and still has like 50 million subscribers."

videogamedunkey,36s2es,SarcasticLizard,21,Thu May 21 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"Last I heard he makes around 3 or 4mil a year, but don't quote me on that. Or do. I don't care."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,HerpsterKKat,-1,Thu May 21 19:52:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but a lot of that goes to taxes Im assuming
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Jesoph,36,Thu May 21 22:13:13 2015 UTC,This applies to all jobs. He's still a millionaire.

videogamedunkey,36s2es,Jesoph,5,Fri May 22 08:28:44 2015 UTC,He actually started in his reddit AMA that he made 2.8 million dollars last year.
videogamedunkey,36s2es,ThatClanGuy,9,Thu May 21 23:01:01 2015 UTC,That's fucking insane. Remember when youtubers making like 100k was a big ass deal?

videogamedunkey,36s2es,Fermorian,2,Fri May 22 07:50:19 2015 UTC,"whats insane is that that is after paying backtaxes. he's making bank for sure, but I see it only fitting because currently he has to be one of the most widespread ""hated"" people on the internet, and for what? for making videos?   I don't feel bad for him because he's set for life economically, he has a beautiful girlfriend and seems to have good family relationships. But he can never have a ""normal"" life from this point on."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Settleforthep0p,4,Sat May 23 03:00:56 2015 UTC,He allows comments on them. Just checked.

videogamedunkey,36s2es,Negranon,18,Thu May 28 11:40:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he does. On all accounts from people in the YouTube industry talking about him (i don't have sources right now sorry) he's a pretty nice down to earth guy. He just really knows his audience and makes the most of that
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Nishla,4,Fri May 22 01:02:55 2015 UTC,Haha I love dunkey but are you guys really not seeing the hipocrisy in calling him out for just making money off of screaming at a camera?

videogamedunkey,36s2es,Kraz226,23,Fri May 22 11:43:02 2015 UTC,"Actually I think pewdiepie is trapped in his persona. Watching his dark souls video you can notice he wants to make a good video but can't, otherwise the people that normally watch it won't. I respect him, not his video personality."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Susarn,11,Fri May 22 14:06:39 2015 UTC,"Pewdiepie is just history repeating. He will make a lot of money being an Internet babysitter, make a cameo appearance on a prominent TV show and then fade into obscurity as quickly as he came. If he's smart he'll know when to call it quits like Fred and be set to live comfortably the rest of his life."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Scorpion8754,8,Fri May 22 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like PewDiePie's been around forever though.  People have been referring to him and making jokes about him for years.  For someone that's part of the inexorable cycle of popularity/celebrity, he has a hefty amount of staying power (especially since this is taking place on the internet)"
videogamedunkey,36s2es,localvagrant,3,Sat May 23 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's really hard to say for sure. Gaming channels seem to have more longevity since there's basically endless amounts of games for them to spew over. On the other hand, huge youtube channels like the annoying orange, and Fred were massive channels aimed at the same demographic but are pretty much non-existent today. It's really a matter of time before he throws in the towel like Fred or slowly descends to obscurity like Athenewins, where people might stumble upon his channel years after being one of the top of all time and go ""This guy is STILL making videos?"" Hard to tell. Only thing that is for sure is that some other annoying bullshit made to entertain preteens will take his place.  The good thing about making content for kids is that they're the biggest demographic on youtube, and probably a small percentage have adblock so it's all cash. The bad part is that their attention span is puny and they will undoubtedly get bored and move on eventually."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Scorpion8754,10,Sat May 23 06:00:46 2015 UTC,Wow those comments below him are pretty vicious.

His fan base are absolute cancer though. He shut off his comments awhile ago, so I think even HE realizes how bad it is."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,Puggpu,5,Wed May 27 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"I used to follow a WoW YouTube channel back when I played WoW, wowcrendor, and he said that when he met Pewdiepie he thought it would be extremly annoying but to his surprise, when meeting him out of character, he was a pretty regular dude. I think he knows his target audience and exploits it. That's pretty smart."
videogamedunkey,36s2es,bobbyjoechan,5,Sun May 24 22:40:25 2015 UTC,Why are people so cynical? Can he just  be a different person on camera and a different person in real life? I act different around my family than when I'm around my friends. Same thing for him. It doesn't have to be that he's putting up some act just for the sake of money or something.

videogamedunkey,36sond,Jesoph,6,Fri May 22 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"I have no clue why you're being downvoted, I'm gonna guess its just people seeing it as weird because it isn't for the country they're from.  In the United Kingdom it's 16 which is only a year above but I guess that everyone that has sex at the age of consent is a pedo right.  And no I'm not defending UberDanger, I have no clue who he is but he seems like a cunt who brags about his sex life that is gonna fail when he reaches 30.

The one thing he does show is that there is always some ""inspiration/copying"" in his circle and that it's not something that should be defended (like he shows in the two clips of nola and key).

Of course you can point to the Sky Williams clip or the exaggerated UberDanger parody and say the video is unserious, but I'm curious to know whether or not he really dislikes Keyori.  Regardless, pointing out all the fake voices/mannerisms of the mainstream Youtube gamers is certainly a valuable topic of discussion on its own."

Then he shows how Keyori steals his videos ideas (watering them down and making them for kids like dunkey rapped about). Then he shows how he gets shit for being himself on his original videos and compares it to the UberDanger scandal and how Uber he gets all the support.  Edit: Typos and grammar"

videogamedunkey,36nxxg,KyokoKirigiri,10,Wed May 20 23:39:47 2015 UTC,Liking him isn't something you should feel bad about.  It's just some of us don't like his content.   IMO he has shifted towards the pewdiepie model of yelling and being obnoxious rather than putting in deep thoughts (archengeia) or scripted comedy (dunkey).
videogamedunkey,36nxxg,Sciencepenguin,1 point,Thu May 21 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"Oh no I definitely agree. I don't even watch his stuff anymore, I just felt that it was relevant to the point you made about early family guy."

videogamedunkey,36nxxg,shiny_dunsparce,4,Thu May 21 15:13:14 2015 UTC,The point of that segment is that they all use literally the exact same obnoxious Pewdiepie personality. Dunkey and Jontron each have their own unique brand of humor which can't really be boiled down to your description.
videogamedunkey,36nxxg,billpika,-1,Wed May 20 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"Markiplier is calmer than pewdiepie, and none of them were really loud and obnoxious except for pewdiepie, markiplier, and Irishman."

They aren't really plagiarizing but you can tell that some videos are knockoffs of Dunkey's videos. As for how they react to people accusing them of stealing Dunkey's content, I haven't heard anyone say anything specific about Dunkey calling them out other then that clip in Dunkey's newest video with Keyori saying he was a fan but wouldn't copy him.

videogamedunkey,34li8i,MrGobelsack,1 point,Sat May 2 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this movie, and I'm not the only one, as many famous directors were greatly inspired by it. George Lucas drew a lot of inspiration for Star Wars from it for example.   I strongly encourage you to watch the video I linked to!   Done? Nice. You talked about the ending. And as it is said in the video, Kubrick basically made a silent movie in the era of movies where dialogue is almost the main part. It explores new ways to influence the viewers and I feel like the ending is the best example of that. You're watching this 20 minute long sequence of what looks like an acid trip through space, and then suddenly comes the final scene. Which gives it sooo much greater impact!"
videogamedunkey,34li8i,MrGobelsack,1 point,Sat May 2 19:23:19 2015 UTC,"(Disclaimer: I don't know shit and my opinions are worthless and dumb)  From a purely artistic standpoint, sure, I understand that many found it to be spectacular. And I'm definitely aware that it's highly critically acclaimed and has inspired many other filmmakers and things of the like, but cultural impact aside, in the context of the movie and nothing else, I personally didn't enjoy it. I was actually very interested in the origins of the black monolith, what they were going to find, what was going to happen, etc., but ""20 minute long acid trip followed by odd inexplicable events"" felt like a bit of a cop-out. Which I'm sure wasn't the intention, I was just hoping for a more sensical conclusion and then I got what felt like more of an artistic statement than a proper ending."
videogamedunkey,34li8i,henryuuk,1 point,Sat May 2 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the video? They also said that Kubrick tried creating a new format for movies.  I think you are just too used to the normal format. Since this is so far off from the norm, you have a hard time taking it in. I am hereby not criticizing you, just stating why I think you don't like it.  You're used to resolution, to a story that's wrapped up.   Here the focus doesn't lie on story, dunk also criticized that in his review. But since he now stated it as one of his favorite, I think he realized that. He found something other to enjoy.  Maybe you'll rewatch it one day, maybe you'll enjoy it then. If not, I'm sure you'll survive too."

And I wouldn't say I had a hard time taking it in, but I see what you're getting at. I was watching it for the wrong reasons, I guess, but I feel like it just isn't the type of format that appeals to me. Opinions do change of course, but I think I'll put off rewatching it for now.

A movie can be symbolizing the actual true meaning of life, but if it is doing so in a way that people need to explain it to 95% of the audience in order for them to go : ""ow, so it wasn't just 'being weird' ?"" then your message is lost on the masses."

But thinking about this critically I just don't understand why anyone would be friends with a guy like Uber. He doesn't seem like the most morally correct human being in anyway.

videogamedunkey,340p23,GnarbroTaKa,5,Tue Apr 28 05:35:12 2015 UTC,"It's weird that League content creators are split into groups. Dunkey vs Keyori's friends. Keyori is just jealous Dunkey has more subscribers, that's it. People are fighting over who has the most subscribers and I can't even get my videos noticed. They're entire job is to make one youtube video a week and they bitch and cause drama. Thank you for taking the high road Jason."
videogamedunkey,340p23,eddiecraycray,2,Tue Apr 28 02:05:59 2015 UTC,"So... Did this all start because Uberdanger posted on twitter that he fucked his fans? There seems to be so many parts to this ""controversy"" that I can't even follow it.  Could someone give me a tiny bit of context as to what started this whole disaster?  Also, I'm glad to know that Pringle doesn't care about it, whatever it is. I would hate to see him get involved with something that had nothing to do with him anyway."
videogamedunkey,340p23,GnarbroTaKa,4,Mon Apr 27 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and he bragged about it a couple more times, said stuff about Leah(the link in the OP) trying to get to dunkey, was part of the /r/leagueoflegends upvote circlejerk skype group where they all used their accounts to upvote each other and downvote others to keep themselves high up on the page etc etc"

If you want my opinion, I don't think Uber did anything wrong. (Except vote-manipulation, which he was respectively punished for.) But honestly, he's 18. If he sleeps with someone in Denmark that's only 2 years younger than him, I honestly don't think that's a big deal. And so he shits on Dunkey. If they don't really like each other, fine. Lets just keep him out of this sub."
videogamedunkey,340p23,kizzeret,6,Mon Apr 27 13:20:20 2015 UTC,I'm totally with you. I think the vote thing was shitty but sleeping with fans is whatever. He's not hurting anyone else so why not.
videogamedunkey,340p23,deepfelix,2,Tue Apr 28 00:10:58 2015 UTC,Because he allegedly slept with 16 y/o in PAX. He then it's ok because in Denmark (where he's from) that's above age of consent.  He now denies he did that and that the girl he slept with at PAX was 20.
videogamedunkey,340p23,deepfelix,2,Tue Apr 28 02:04:42 2015 UTC,This is false. He said he slept with a 20 and 21 year old at pax and the 16 year old was infact in Denmark. Also where does he outright say it was at pax if it even happened at all.
videogamedunkey,340p23,deepfelix,9,Tue Apr 28 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"On Twitter. Kid went on a rampage and started tweeting all this stupid shit. I'm gonna be honest with ya, I didn't even care for the guy but it was pretty funny seeing him losing his shit."
videogamedunkey,340p23,arthrax,2,Tue Apr 28 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"It's not true about him sleeping with a 16 y/o in PAX, that's just misinterpretation, not sure why the other guy is getting downvoted. The reason he mentioned age of consent is because people claimed he had sex with someone 15 in Denmark, but that wasn't true either, but had it been true it would've still been legal."
videogamedunkey,340p23,lessthanstraight,-1,Tue Apr 28 23:49:01 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's true. He deleted all his tweets after his rampage."

videogamedunkey,340p23,Natick,2,Wed Apr 29 10:14:03 2015 UTC,"ya seriously the whole stigma that he was having underage sex is just ridiculous. 16 year old girls can have consenual sex and the male party should not be considered to have fucking raped her unless she actually didnt consent or if he drugged her to make her consent, etc."
videogamedunkey,340p23,deepfelix,4,Mon Apr 27 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, when you're a teenager that 2 year difference is pretty big. Theres a bit of a difference between 16 and 18. Even if it was legal, it's still pretty scummy. Or at least creepy."

I'm guessing Dunkey uses it as a multi-purpose term to describe unsavoury people. First time I heard it was during his Kane and Lynch video when he called himself a jag for quoting incorrect information. Since then he's used it in many different ways and variations such as ""Jaegler"" (jaygler?) in Birthday Fiddle.  I guess in the long run it just hits the spot as a swear (or a supplement to a swear). ""Maurice, you're such a goddamn jag!"""

Blakinola made a very good point about his announcer pack when the wave of other announcer packs started coming in. A lot of them will sound like shit because they aren't all recorded under the same settings. There will be background noise, some will be at different volume, etc.  If dunk were to record a session just full of his one liners and replaced the current audio files with them, it would be amazing.  otherwise, I'm going to hear   EYYYYYY BAYYBEEEEEEEEE (music in background) PENTAKILLPAPAJOHNASFDGSFH not even.... close...."

I mean, yeah, they're both funny in their own ways, but they have totally different comedy styles. Jontron is more of a ""eck whooowha random cut AND SUDDENLY IM SCREAMING"" kind of comedy and videogamedunkey is a almost british style comedy thats very straight and unexaggerated, using under/over reactions and blatantly false facts/names for things.  If I had to compare dunkey to any other famous youtuber, ititd be fitzthistlewitz. Seriously, check out his ""chess"" and ""laura croft"" reviews and you'll see what I mean."

videogamedunkey,339q49,xLeahbee,6,Mon Apr 20 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"There are three ways to do this :    Free way : Host a server on a computer you own yourself. And install all the whatnot into it. But keep in mind, if this computer is off / offline, your server will be down. So if you decide you still want to host a server on a computer one of you guys have that will constantly stay online 24h/24h, or just keep it on, and close the server for a few times during the day, check this tutorial : http://forum.teamspeak.com/showthread.php/63164-Complete-guide-to-setup-a-TeamSpeak-3-Server-on-Windows-desktops I know it looks long and complicated, but just go through it slowly step by step and you should be fine, it's very neatly explained. The ""cheaper"" way : You aren't going to rent an actual teamspeak server, but you're going to rent that ""always online computer"". And then set up your teamspeak server on it. You might need a bit of expert help on this if you decide to do it, but it is relatively cheaper, since you can then set up as many server slots as you like. The easy way : Straight up pay monthly for a Teamspeak 3 Server. You can choose how many user slots you might need, and then make your choice. Not very economic, but not very expensive either. Just google Teamspeak 3 Server Renting, and you should get a huge list of good hosts!"

They don't like change so that's why they get mad he comes out with a different video other than what their original reasoning was. Sadly these people are missing out on a lot of amazing content. I've been with Dunkey since before his 50K and I'm still gonna be here when he gets to 5M."

videogamedunkey,32k0ak,jsquared069,41,Tue Apr 14 12:46:07 2015 UTC,It might help if you liked league.
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,Laminectomy,-3,Tue Apr 14 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"agreed league is gross  dont understand the appeal of any of those kinds of games  (as i believe dunkey himself touched on in the ""Die."" video)"
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,tomutwit,7,Thu Apr 16 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"Dunkey is taking advantage of a large fan base that will consistently return for a certain type of video and once he has significant brand and name recognition, can eventually depart from them.   Much of the success that Dunkey has in terms of viewership is not for videos like 'Bubberducky' (1 Mil. views), ""Papa John is a Fraud"" (1 Mil. views), but are in fact for League of Legend videos.   If you simply go to his channel and look at the most popular videos, they are, in order:    LoL: Escape from Hell (3.96 Mil) Ultimate Skyrim (3.95 Mil) LoL: Final Boss song (3.6 Mil) LoL: Best Champion (3.5 Mil) LoL: Escape from Gold (3.2 Mil)   And even including those, only TWO out of his top 30 most popular videos are not league of legends related. So you see, the very fact that we get more frequent Dunkey videos (and therefore statistically more non-League videos) is entirely dependent on him putting out LoL videos to get revenue and draw attention to his brand.   Whereas before Dunkey was making a lot of random videos about different things to find his niche, now he has found it and needs to exploit it for attention and money so that he is more free then to pursue other things he also genuinely enjoys (and he does obviously enjoy LoL as well)."

videogamedunkey,32k0ak,TheKing_Fuckers,2,Wed Apr 15 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Gary."
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,garduglo,4,Wed Apr 15 05:04:29 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this.  His Ultimate Skyrim video is very new compared to those popular videos and is constantly climbing up soon to be his most popular video.  Until about a year ago his Best Champion video was the most popular for the longest time.  But before any of that if you been around for a while, it was Dora the Explorer video that was around the most popular.  Dunkey also started with more playthroughs.  Such as Shenmu & Super Mario.  Dunkey has 2 major things going for him.  1 is how large his league fan base is.  And 2 is how large the league fan base is in general.  So not only do some people only watch league and his league content, his videos are also showing up related to other league videos grabbing more views because of how large that community is.  That's just how league is, especially on youtube.  But his older and non league videos are much better in terms of quality imo.  I think if there is a trend to notice on dunks channel is that his community is growing larger and they are looking for more content in general.  I see a lot of people comment that they think league is ok compared to others.  Dunkey is literally the most popular League of legend related youtuber, so the league community is centering around him.  But Dunkey is also getting wider and wider with his general audience, and once his subscriber numbers start blowing out of proportion.  His other high quality non league videos will get the recognition that they deserve."
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,AttackoftheHank,2,Tue Apr 14 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"You have almost no basis by which to disagree with me. Its that clear.  His top 30 videos are only 6.667% non-League of Legends content.  And you know what? Lets expand that Top 30 to the Top 100. Only 2 more are Non-League related. That's 5/100. 5% of his Top 100 videos are non-League related. I have 0% understanding as to how you disagree with what I've said.   Dunkey is taking advantage of the much larger fan base in LoL. Most of his success is because of his LoL videos. Ultimate Skyrim is becoming his most popular video, but Skyrim is a HUGE AAA title that when you make a quality video over, you are likely to get a lot of views for. Pointing out that he had one big hit video in the last month that was non-League related pales in comparison the the disproportionate amount of LoL content he has put out...   Why? LoL is way, way easier not only to get noticed from, but edit and commentate. You can go back to Dunkey's first videos... his Megaman play-through, his Battletoads video... and they are hardly at 97,000. Literally none of his older videos will ever eclipse his newer ones, especially the League ones, because the method by which he brings people into the channel now, primarily, is through LoL - so they will have already viewed his LoL videos."

videogamedunkey,32k0ak,ChokeZero,2,Wed Apr 15 23:11:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone here is familiar with my youtube but I too had/have a fanbase who expects one type of video. Let me tell you it's a pain. When running a youtube channel you wanna take into account both what people want to see and what you want to do, but primarily focusing on what you want to do. I used to make one kind of video exclusively, before I finally got bored of that and started to transition to other things, and people got UPSET. Which I really don't understand. People seem to think that if you make something other than your trademark, then you're putting your trademark on the back burner and prioritizing other things, when really this new video was just a thing you wanted to do. My channel has ultimately become me making whatever I want, sometimes completely different than the kind of videos that originally attracted my fanbase, but the great thing is my subscribers love that now, and ideally I think this is how all youtube channels should be. We need more people making whatever they want to make, and less one trick pony pewdiepies, and we also need a community who approves of that.  Personally, I find his League videos only mildly entertaining. Maybe because I don't play LoL. Dunkey commentary is always funny but when watching League something about them feels too... serious?... professional?... not sure how to describe it but I definitely prefer Dunkey's other videos."
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,sadlazyandstupid,2,Thu Apr 16 08:38:52 2015 UTC,"I subscribed to him for his LoL videos, but I ended up liking his non-LoL videos more. They became a bit stale, and his non-LoL videos were funnier."
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,LimitlessRX,3,Thu Apr 16 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"I like his other videos more.  And his name implies that he is a video gamer not just a leaguer.  So to me if anything, the hate goes back to the LoL toxic community in general.  I enjoy his league videos but his other videos as a whole are great and he has more of them.  I think as a whole I like more of his non league videos too."
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,joosh82,2,Tue Apr 14 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I watch Dunkey specifically for his non-league videos. I don't play League, so I don't know whats going on or understand his commentary in League vids.   His other videos are absolutely hilarious though, which is why I'm subscribed."
videogamedunkey,32k0ak,Tanookachu,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"Some YouTubers will use a popular game to increase their video views and then just continue doing that (playing popular games) instead of creating the content that they had originally started with. While it does sometimes frustrate me I suppose it really is up to that person. A good example is thesyndicateproject. He used to play BO zombies all the time and so I subscribed to him but now he only plays other games. Which is fine, but that's not really why I subscribed to him.   They just think that he is doing what some YouTubers do. Dunkey isn't like that though. He still releases a lot of League videos which is why he has a great channel. He still gives his original subscribers (the ones who made him popular) what they want and he gives new content that a broader spectrum of people might like. He draws in newer crowds while keeping his old fanbase happy."

videogamedunkey,32eaud,Dinkletickler,11,Mon Apr 13 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"ITT how dunkey's videos helped us?   when i first started playing league, about a year ago, one of my best friends showed me dunkey's videos! she was also showing me how to play league, and it was really cool. around the same time, my ex and i were on and off, due in part to both my depression and his immaturity, and for a long time it was just gross and hard to deal with. sometimes, though, during the good periods, we would watch his videos together, and quote it to eachother jokingly, it kinda became a little thing for us, watching all his videos together when they came out, all that stuff. so after my ex finally cut me loose a few months later and dumped me, i felt like i needed to just give up and stop doing everything. i stopped watching dunkey's videos for a long time because i had associated it with my ex, and i kept playing league, but I couldn't bring myself to watch any of his videos, because even though I thought they were hilarious, i just couldnt do it. i couldnt listen to music, i couldn't care about anything, i would just go to school and come home and play league and go to bed.  anyway, a couple weeks after the aforementioned dumping, my best decided to cut off contact with me entirely (she couldnt deal with my depression either), and at that point i was just at a really shitty low. i was just done, i was just completely totally done with everything. but as i was sobbing my eyes out, I got a notification on my phone; ""videogamedunkey has uploaded a new video"". i was so pissed off, like, what do you even want? but i decided to watch anyway, for some reason. when i did, it was like, something in my brain flicked on and i laughed for the first time in months and months. i laughed so hard, my grandparents came in to see if I was okay. it felt so wonderful to finally laugh again after such a long time, and continued to watch after, and yeah his videos really just pulled me through a tough time.  sorry if this was uncalled for or dumb i just thought this was a good place to share.  tldr dunkeys videos helped me through a really bad depressive episode after all my friends abandoned me.

I would think that the main problem is getting start-up capital for the initial production of merchandise which would include payment for artistry (though the community could produce free art), as well as working out a distributor, and exploring in what ways to protect his rights to the vgdunkey brand to prevent mimic merch from being produced.   If such a thing was an issue, I'm sure we could raise funds to get over the hump - if demand was high enough, after the first hump we'd have good merch available."
videogamedunkey,32dufb,Laminectomy,3,Mon Apr 13 03:11:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. There is also the sad truth of people saying one thing and doing the other. People will always say in any type of business 'I will buy this if you do this' and then don't end up buying it.   But thousands of people will help back a crowd-sourcing campaign and there is no doubt we will fly fly pizza pie any goal!

videogamedunkey,32e159,s0ulwax,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:39:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Cr1TiKaL became more famous because of RWJ and in the last year and a half or so has been trying to be funny for his audience. His older stuff is amazing though. Dunkey is just more consistent and isn't as mysterious.

videogamedunkey,32e159,DoctorOfDerpology,2,Wed Apr 15 05:09:52 2015 UTC,I think they're like two opposing but similar personalities. Cr1tikal derives comedy from monotone and lack of reaction as well as creative interpretations of things. Dunkey derives comedy from too much reaction and creative interpretations of things. Interestingly enough they still manage to have really similar humor. I'd like to see some kind of collaboration or co-op game play.

There's a lot so feel free to skip any questions you don't feel like answering. I apologize ahead of time for any questions that have been answered or that are stupid as shit.   What's the most annoying thing your fans do? Do you have any regrets in your youtube career (uploading a certain video?)  Who is currently your favorite champion in league of legends? What's your process for making a video? Do you think you'll get on a more consistent streaming schedule anytime in the future or are you pretty much done with Twitch? Are your parents aware of your youtube channel? If so, how do they feel about it? Have you ever scrapped a project you were working on because you thought it wasn't funny? Who's your favorite youtuber (besides you) Have you ever tried to contact JonTron about making some sort of collab since it appears you're both fans of each other? If not, do you think you ever will? How did you and Leah meet? What did you first think of her? How did you come up with the name videogamedunkey? What's your current opinion on machinima?  Do you still live with your mom or did you move out again? If your youtube career never became successful, what do you think you would be doing with your life?   Thanks for answering or ignoring my questions! Love you stinkydinky!"

But my second time through, I played on the hardest difficulty and played the DLC episode and my whole opinion on the game changed. I really loved it the second time around, but I do still hate the drawn out strangle animations every two seconds.  3 - Wukong baby. He's got it all. He's got the early game damage, the comedy W move. The CC ult. Such a great pick for when you actually want to win.  5 - I wanted to start streaming more this year, but my videos are taking longer and longer to make and I want to concentrate the most on my videos.   6 - My mom likes my dancing video. Or any of them without swear words.  8 - Aside from my friends, TheFoodReviewer, Ashens, and Grand Illusions are always putting out great videos.  10 - I met her on skype, then like 6 months later she came to Milwaukee and I was like ooo mama leme get.   12 - Worst guys ever.

videogamedunkey,325mh7,schbre16,114,Mon Apr 20 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Hey Dunkmasterflex,  I’ve two questions, if you have the time.   As of right now, you are a popular Youtuber who is likely receiving some revenue (I click all your video ads ‘cause I’m such a bro) and you’re getting more popular as the days go by. That being said, you had to have thought about the long time sustainability of the vgdunkey channel and your brand – it is difficult and stressful to cater to fickle viewers who have different tastes, and you likely feel compelled to consistently put out content that they will find enjoyable and funny, which can also be very stressful. Because of the nature of entertainment, over the course of a few years you may not be able to rely on your videos as a source of income. So, my question (finally) is: Do you plan on doing youtube and vgd videos long-term – and if not, what is the next step for you as Jason G. and not just vgdunkey? I discovered you only a few months ago, but I absolutely love your videos. When I’m taking a shit, when I’m on a bus, etc, I’ll just go watch them – they are really funny to me, Dinkembe Dunktumbo. I would like to meet you one day, as a fan and friend; also, because I’m a fag. My concern is that perhaps you feel pressured to be funny or be ‘dunkey’ around fans, and that’s why you’ve been relatively private? If that’s not the case, great, and my question is: “Are you going to/would you ever have a vgdinky fan meet-up so I can whoop your ass at Super Smash Bruddas?”   Thanks again for doing the AMA – I appreciate the undoubtable hard-work that goes into entertaining myself and others. If not a lot of people put in questions, I have a few more that I know some other people have been asked - assuming this doesn't blow up. I look forward to any fan-dunkey collaboration LoL games that might be set up (IGN: Wombraider2015…don’t lolking me you fucks)!   Thanks, - Lam"
videogamedunkey,325mh7,shotgunsparkle,353,Fri Apr 10 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"I'll probably still be making videos after they stop getting attention, but I'm hoping to learn about investing this year to get more financially stable.

I got invited to the alpha mode and also played during the beta test and its without a doubt pretty much exactly what dunkey explained in his videos. He laid the nail on the head on the game. Also how u barely get any gold from winning a match in that game and how the heroes are pretty expensive and really the no item thing is just crap idea. Because the only way to really come back is securing objectives which is pretty hard to do since they game is literally not what i thought it was. Could've been a good game but sad how this game has turned out. Even though its still in work, it doesn't look like much is gonna change."

Ironically, Raidcall is actually the best software I've found for it. Sovitia and AhLexAh (Two decent sized streamers) have one and it works really well for them. It would be really crowded with Dunk's fans all the time but for games specifically you could make locked rooms and PM the password to the room to everyone playing.  Also I've been kinda curious about two things and I missed Dunkster's AMA (cries a lot) so if you wouldn't mind answering I'd love to know =D   Do  you plan on making videos yourself? You're pretty well liked in Jason's community and I think we'd all be down for a LeahBee channel with you and your friends, like how Jaynee has her channel and makes her own stuff with and without Keyori.  In ""Dunkey in Paris"" did you know Jason was filming your butt for the video or did you see it afterwards with no knowledge? I like to think you saw it and just kinda, ""JASON!""

videogamedunkey,31ouop,zexiion,3,Sun Apr 12 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"okay cool i will look up about raidcall thank u! and about ur questions, ill never be doing any league type videos, there are just too many ppl doing it now and its getting silly lol they're like all the same! (jason not included of course :)) but i put up random crappy video clips sometimes on my xLeahbee channel of things we do, when i get a new computer id like to do some actual projects for fun on things im interested in personally like crafts/other games and stuuff. but i dont wanna be like a tagalong of jason's things if you know what i mean. and in the paris video, i kind of had an idea of what he was doing but i didn't really think he was doing that for real lol."
videogamedunkey,31ouop,SuperCho,2,Sun Apr 12 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"There's also Teamspeak and Mumble if you end up dis-liking raidcall.  I guess that's a fair point. There are a ton of League players already doing edited clipped up footage of games. Jason definitely has a more unique style going on which is very nice. I was unaware you had a channel, I'll have to check it out. It would neat to see you doing playthroughs of games on Steam you like. If you enjoy crafting you could do some Terraria stuff. The Minecradt market is pretty saturated but there's not a lot of recognized names in the Terraria world besides HERO. I know what you mean about not being a tag-along of Jason. A buddy and I are doing some duo comedy LPs and our major inspiration was Game Grumps, but we're very clear on our stance of ""we cannot just be mini GG."" It's always better for your videos to be your own thing.  Ahaha that seems like Jason from what we all know about him."
videogamedunkey,31ouop,samsonofspite,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"Raidcall does not support Mac - and with 60% of LoL users being enrolled or having been in college, it is increasingly more common to see LoL users on Mac. To this end, I would suggest as /u/Windfiar said, Teamspeak or Mumble, which does support the Mac OS."

videogamedunkey,315war,nxgnbeastmode,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"Im assuming its almost all scripted and mostly voiceovers. I like it. It makes his humor less cringey and more enjoyable to me. His Rust video was definitely in large part, voiced over."
videogamedunkey,315war,rampage95,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:01:29 2015 UTC,"I've watched donkey since the beginning of 2012, which means well over 3 years. A good majority of his videos are scripted, and it's really easy to tell when it is. Whenever his voice loses quality and sounds like it'd be from Skype or something, that's when his videos are live.   Personally, I think dunkey is way funnier with his natural kind of humor. Watch any of the Good Meets Evil series (I've watched all of them several times), or his TTT videos, which are all live.   Since around 2014 his scripted humor just because too fake and just not that great. He's still naturally funny, though.  The fact that it's scripted is not a bad thing. He himself openly admits and makes it obvious many times that it is scripted. It's not like he tries to hide it."

If Leah wants to be mod I doubt since it's a fan subreddit. But currently there isn't much else to do in this sub besides new videos and video searches, we need some community action like fan art competitions, game ""flash mobs"" or something like that."
videogamedunkey,2ze3p3,LKJ55,5,Tue Mar 17 21:50:00 2015 UTC,We really do need an active mod. I support this 100%

videogamedunkey,2ze3p3,Main-Account,2,Wed Mar 18 06:24:14 2015 UTC,Yeah unfortunately this is the problem with such a small sub but would be worth it. I support this

videogamedunkey,2ze3p3,ChapWOP,2,Wed Mar 18 05:53:24 2015 UTC,Because video requests aren't content?
videogamedunkey,2ze3p3,garduglo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 06:38:43 2015 UTC,This subreddit has hardly any content. All the content already being posted will be seen regardless.
videogamedunkey,2ze3p3,roberoonska,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:55:10 2015 UTC,I'll help any way I can!! I'm good with HTML/CSS/PHP and just general stuff. I'd love to see this sub take off.

In order to complete his undercover disguise, he dons a Spanish accent.   Connections between Bagool and Spain or another Spanish-speaking country have yet to be determined, though this lead is very helpful for Dunkey lore scholars (Dunkologists)."
videogamedunkey,2mayvf,udbettarecognize,1 point,Sun Nov 16 18:18:06 2014 UTC,"I think it's obvious that Bagool is actually is the leader of a Spainish drug cartel. This would explain the ""Gabool"" wars, as dunk didn't want to incite the wrath of the cartel. This also explains why when you say bagool, he sends his cartel members to kill you,  as he dosnt want his drug running business to get revealed. Fortunately, he is far too busy playing knack and usually sends his dumbest member Bafool."

videogamedunkey,2kytqf,Schmerlock,1 point,Sat Nov 1 10:20:14 2014 UTC,"I play Sion top in last time. He has ass much crowd control (Q: strong slow or a long stun, E: slow (and armor reduction), R: frickin long stun) and his w can deal very much damage when maxed second (prozentual damage!!). He is also a strong laner (I build him most times full tank), has strong early game, he can escape easy through slows, stun and ult (everything is my opinion, I don't play him that long). Beside the CC, his Q also deals much damage. Negative is that he gets countered by champions with much CC (Garen, Cho'Gath...), because his Q gets interrupted by silences, and how dunki mentioned, his low damage on ult. I hope Riot will buff the ult damage."
