Trying to save the $300 to get the internet on, and that's not going so hot, lol. So i have a collection of awesome games i can play offline. While i don't have time registered to them, i earn achievements! Working on winning with the Lost in BoI:R (almost 2100 deaths, ugh) or the vast 1336 ToME ones. :p can't wait for online so i can pick up Payday 2. Edit. I'd also like to grab it for my son. He tends to get a wee too excited about games he plays, and he's been driving me nuts to play Rebirth. The last thing his mom and i need is him going to school/church saying he got the satanic bible and killed Mom! While perversely funny, wouldn't end well. :p"

GiftofGames,3e4bc4,denchoooo,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"Not entering right now as the game I want (speedrunners) is completely out of stock and given this site I'm betting they won't get anymore.  It seems like they're just a key reseller, which feels a little shady.  However, did sign up as a referral (I think, I clicked on your referral link then clicked on register so hopefully it did it right), so you should get more residual."
GiftofGames,3e4bc4,RandomNerdGeek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe not a ""reseller"" but yes, majority of their games are from bundles and sales... Its quite rare you'll find non-bundled or sale games there, if there is they are usually highly priced rewards.  Being shady..... I can 100% vouch for them, I've redeemed over $3,500 worth of games from them, use them for at least 75% of my giveaways and request filling and I think I've had only one dud key, which they promptly fixed and gave me a replacement..."
GiftofGames,3e4bc4,tuibiel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:25:36 2015 UTC,"The shadiness not being from them not being reliable for their keys, I have no doubt they do deliver, but most key resellers get their keys from like IndieGala or the like - and the problem is that IG and their Happy Hour is a major financial drain on most publishers sales.  Check out This story from SMRPG's Developer.  Granted IG has limited their system of Happy Hour to 40 gift keys per person, but it's still ridiculous.  Plus Steam turning back off OAuth means that key resellers are back in the game.  It's terrible for developers, and so I find that, even though I can get an absolutely killer deal compared to anywhere else, I will do my best to mostly avoid key resellers."

There are some programs like spriter pro,  RPG maker, and stencyl (1 year) which are worth it, but I mainly got it for the asset packs personally. Game guru and app game kit are amazingly limited. Game guru is basically a level editor, not an engine.  If you want to get into game making i suggest you look at Unity and unreal engine. There's probably a few python game frameworks as well. Especially if you're a third year CS student, you should be able to use them"

I would try to create some kind of first-person platformer with it (kinda like Jumping Flash for PS1).  The thing im looking forward most is getting to a new school where I'll be studying to become a game developer. So these programs would help me with designing side of things,  Here is my Steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/junttiana"
GiftofGames,3dxbwz,junttiana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I was looking foward to actually getting this bundle, but I didn't have any money that I could use for it. Mainly, I wanted to get spriter pro.  I am an aspiring hobbiest game developer, and right now I need some sprite animating tools, and spriter pro seems awesome for that. I would be using it to work on a game I'm making (a 2D platformer in Unity) and future games.  Right now my hobbies include playing and making games, and I am also a musician. I play guitar and trumpet, and when I am done developing the base game I am going to record some guitar music to put into it! I can't wait, the university I'm going to has a recording studio and everything, and hopefully they'll let me use it.  Well, about a month ago I got to graduate from HS, which was awesome. It was a huge weight off my shoulders, and I finally able to start developing full-time.  Next month I'm leaving for college (hence why I didn't have money for the bundle) and I'm pretty excited about that. Instead of learning how to take SAT's and reading Shakespeare, I'm going to be learning more about what I am passionate about, computer science and mathematics. It's going to be awesome, and hopefully I'll learn how to make my code better.  Here's my steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/InvalidArg_12/  Thanks!"

UE4 May be free but I want to spend my time actually trying to make a game first and see how it works. I would make a iOS android game to simulate a simple pixel platformer as a simple test. Some of the things that are nice about me is that I enjoy spending time with friends and doing things for them out of the kindness of my heart.

Right now I guess I haven't unlocked any new achievements because I just started a new run .I've been constantly restarting for this week due to the game constantly crashing on me and me trying to find which mod is the culprit* and then stupidly downloading a new set of mods because they looked cool, just ask the guys in the chat. I'll probably actually go thru with this run since I haven't experienced any issues so far and things are actually pretty stable.  *If you're wondering, I think it was Better New Vegas, it's one of the mods that changes a lot of stuff in Outer Vegas.

I have a PS4 and a Wii but I have those set up in my bar/rec room downstairs and they mostly just keep dust off the top of my entertainment center.   Will your desk stay that neat and clean? Mine never does. Also, the cords you have in front of your tower would be a deathtrap for me.

Only downside is that it doesn't fit in a desk.  Any recommendations on PS4 games? I've not got any yet, so mine is just keeping the dust away, as you said.  My desk is already messy! To be fair, that's partially as I'm using it for things I'd keep on my bedside cabinet as that's not been moved yet, but there's no way it'll remain that neat. I'll have to try tuck the cords away before my girlfriend moves in as she'd do exactly the same...  By the way, Sleeping Dogs - any idea what functions require online?

GiftofGames,3dqgit,observantguy,3,Sat Jul 18 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"Flash leaks memory like there's no tomorrow  The actual reason is that it allows for a work flow that I like.  I run Firefox Nightly 64-bit and usually have around 1000 tabs open and actively executing. Depending on what I'm doing, that could be upwards of 12 GB in use. I do this in order to try to get it to crash. Crashes lead to bug reports, bug reports lead to fixing, seeing users contribute to 64-bit Windows development will hopefully lead Mozilla to make official 64-bit Firefox releases.  Other benefits is that I use some for a RAM drive, which helps with things like video editing/rendering. I got DIMMDrive and use the same concept for games, without dealing with manual data syncing.  Lastly, I spent ~$2000 on GPUs and ~$1600 on cooling equipment. What's another ~$400 for the knowledge that I'll never have to upgrade that system's RAM again?  tl;dr - Do I need it? Is it nice to have?"

Monitor with garbage speakers built in on the backside. Audio is too low to even think of using the computer without headphones. I think that something may in fact be wrong with my sound card too for that matter because even the headphones don't put out much sound.  Router rented from Satan- I mean, AT&T.  Mouse with a bunch of buttons that I never use.  Keyboard with awkward red coloring on WASD and arrow keys.  $20 Sony Headphones. They're really not bad though and they're lightweight.  Xbox 360 controller. I also have 2 fightpads (though one is kinda busted) and a Playstation 2 controller via USB connector. Oh, and a dance pad, though I can't use it anymore since I moved to the third floor and that would be rude :(  Battery backup sitting on my floor because our building has faulty electric or something which causes power surges all the time, which outright nuked my old computer completely and nearly killed this one by damaging the power supply (which may in fact be why I'm having all these other problems, from before I got the battery backup), but I got that replaced.

It was ages ago so I don't recall clearly, but I remember having to search about why I couldn't get it to work.  I wish I still had my Z21 headset.

I have two 23"" monitors, a Razer Blackwidow and Deathadder. I also do LPs sometimes so I have a ATH-2050 Audio Technica mic.   My pc isn't anything super special. I have a black case with a window on the side. Gpu is a GTX 970 and Cpu is an i5-3570k. I have a 250GB SSD and 1TB hdd.

I also have an Xbox 360 and a PS3 (for the Kingdom Hearts remasters and Tales of Symphonia HD).  Lastly, the PS4 mainly for exclusives because if I had to live in a world without Bloodborne I don't know what I'd do.  There is no actual ""station"" yet because we're in negotiations to move into our first home, so things are scattered around the apartment for now."

For me, it's really taking the whole spirit of the subreddit to a different direction. If you want a game, you put effort into your request, and you have someone read it over to flesh it out better, great! If you don't, then that's your choice and you probably won't get gifted. You don't get punished. It's not like applying to college or taking the SAT where failing will affect the rest of your life, it's submitting a few paragraphs for a free video game. Don't take it too seriously."

Some people maybe just need help to get their writing to ""click."" I think a once a month thing, where people who have trouble writing a decent-length request could ask for ideas on what to talk about without resorting to sob stories or repetition would be good for helping keep requests fresh and interesting to read. I know this isn't the SAT, and people here aren't writing for their future, but if nothing else, it could be a chance for requesters to learn from some experienced request writers and the gifters that fill them."

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,FantasyHeaven,3,Fri Jul 17 13:05:23 2015 UTC,"Hello, I am Zach, or Megalandrys, as I came up with like 4 years ago. First of all, congratulations on the CS:GO Jackpot.  My Steam ID.  Amazon Wishlist? Why not.  This is a really hard decision, which game I want, because there are 4 in specific that I'm really looking at (BioShock Infinite, Dark Souls; Prepare to Die Edition, The Witcher 2, and Remember Me), but if I really have to choose on one I really want to go for, it'd be BioShock Infinite. (I mean, if you're that generous, anything there or on my Amazon wishlist is fine, haha. ""Just kidding. But you never know..."")  I want BioShock Infinite because it's said to be a very good game, and I bought BioShock a while ago, though I can't get the sound to work, and I got BioShock 2 for Christmas a few years ago, so I'd like to have the full set ;3  I can't get it because I am still a student not yet in college, and I spent all but $5 on The Witcher (1), BioShock, and The Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl. I really like games and music, particularly Pink Floyd. Anyway.  I'm interested in it for basically the same reason I said I wanted it (aren't those basically the same question anyway?). But in particular, the graphics/aesthetics look great, from what I know the gameplay and story are better than great, and it's listed as ""Overwhelmingly Postive"" on Steam last I checked, so that says something.  Um, I don't know what a Steam emote is, but I'd think your least favourite game would be Alpha Zylon. I got it really cheap, and I understood why it was that cheap real quick. See, that's my things. probably 75% of my games listed on Steam are free, I got them really cheap, they were in a bundle that I got for >$15, are mods, or are non-Steam games. No, wait, that may be 80%. Or more. Why am I saying this  Thanks a lot for the giveaway!"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,AlexD1891,4,Fri Jul 17 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"My intro post. If you prefer a summary, I basically talked about how my first game console was the Sega Genesis, and how I became interested in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms historical novel. Then I talked about how purchasing a PS2 shaped my favorite gaming genres - JRPGs, SRPGs, and action-adventure games. I then concluded with how my limited disposable income made it necessary for me to become a PC gamer, despite there being hardly any JRPGs and SRPGs on Steam.  My steam ID.  My Amazon wishlist - it doesn't have any games though.  The game that I want from Steam is Dynasty Warriors 8: XL. The game interests me because it is a hack-and-slash game based on the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  The reason that I want to play this game is because I am a fan of the historical novel. I am interested in both reenacting the notable battles in the novel and seeing the hypothetical scenarios that are available in the game.  The battle that I wish to re-enact the most is the battle of Hefei. Historically, Zhang Liao's feats in said battle was something that wouldn't be out of place in a hack-and-slash game - it cemented his position as Cao Cao's best general. When Sun Quan's army of 100 000 surrounded Hefei, Zhang Liao and his army of 7000 was given the order to attack. Leaving the rest behind as garrison, he led a cavalry of 800 and charged towards Sun Quan's banner. Sun Quan was shocked by this bold move, so he ordered his men in a defensive formation and retreated to higher ground. Once Zhang Liao's numbers were whittled down to around 100 riders, Sun Quan was emboldened and order his army to surround Zhang Liao in many layers. However, Zhang Liao was able to break through the encirclement with a few scores of soldiers. The men still trapped in the encirclement despaired: ""Our general abandoned us!"". Hearing this, Zhang Liao charged back into the encirclement and was able to safely lead the rest of his cavalry out. Sun Quan's army was stunned by Zhang Liao's valor and did not act to impede him when he retreated back into Hefei in order to fortify defenses in preparation for the inevitable siege. This act by Zhang Liao greatly bolstered the morale of his men and deflated that of Sun Quan's army. The siege lasted for ten days, but an outbreak of plague for Sun Quan to call for a retreat. As Sun Quan (and about 1000 soldiers) was acting as the rearguard, Zhang Liao saw this as an opportunity to pursue, and led all his cavalry in an all-out charge. And he would have been able to capture Sun Quan too if it weren't for Ling Tong's men of 300 sacrificing themselves in order to buy time for Sun Quan to flee.  As for the hypothetical scenarios, I want to see how much liberties the developers will take in order to give ""good"" endings to the historically defeated factions. Given that both the Shu and Wu factions were destined to fall (a simple matter of geography and population size that their land can sustain), I am curious to see if Koei is able to create a chain of believable scenarios where they don't get wiped out. I am under the impression that the hypothetical scenarios exist to let certain playable characters outlive their historical selves. The most obvious case of this would be Guo Jia, whose cause of death in the novel was illness - how is completing certain battle objectives going to change that? That said, in the novel Cao Cao did lament after his loss at the battle of Red Cliffs that it would not have happened if Guo Jia was still with him - having him there would be a valid justification for any changes in the battle's outcome.  The reasons that I haven't purchased the game myself despite it being on my wishlist for over a year is because the price point that Koei has set for the base game ($50 USD) is too high. The entire reason for me to migrate to PC gaming was because of my limited disposable income - I simply cannot justify buying a $50 USD PC game regardless of its quality. In addition, Koei has never really applied a good discount during sales - the highest discount that I've seen so far was -66% at the last Steam Summer Sale (which still exceeded my allocated gaming budget during the Sale)."

I moved away from my parents house to study in a better city, currently living with my grandma in a small apartment. I'm studying all day and have very little time to do other stuff. (Quote from my request thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3ddwia/requeststeam_rocket_league/). I want to do law in a public university in the state I live. I'm single and really skinny. I have both a step-father and a step-mother.  Since I moved to the city I am now, I've been hitting the gym. My progress is invisible. It's so goddamn hard to gain weight when you have limited money and limited time goddamn it.  I want rocket league. Badly. I've entered so many giveaways, I've been spending my nights refreshing giveaway subreddits to failure.   It's so much simple and tons of fun. Just watching it makes me feel happy. I already told my friends about the game because I liked it so much I wanted to show them.   Today I was watching a dude with no viewers on twitch. I chatted with him for like, 2 hours. He wasn't doing any giveaways, I was just there for the game and for his charisma. Normally I would only watch streams of championships, but this game makes me spend 2 hours with a random dude, it was partly to make him happy, but it wasn't painful, those goddamn matches are so damn fun.  I could talk about the graphics and stuff, but honestly that's not what I look for in a game. My notebook wouldn't even run it anyway. I've always played for the feeling of joy.  I can't get it because the dollar is pretty high here in Brazil. I still have to buy the obligatory reading books for the university test. My bank account money is lower than some of my friend's inventory on steam lol. I only have 2 games. CS:GO I got it in the summer sale, and Garrys mod I got with the money from cs go drops lewl.  I'm not interested. I'M FASCINATED. THAT GAME IS JUST FUN ALL OVER THE PLACE.   Bonus: The white smiling face? Damn that's hard. I don't even know steam games.

I'm interested in video games, longboarding, and dank memes. While counter-strike isn't my ""favorite"" game of all time, I have a lot of hours in it and plan to put a lot more into it in the future.   I do not wish to request from you any games, but if you are giving away skins I would be very interested. I enjoy skins and how they look, but currently only have 2 skins in my inventory that I play with, both of which have been drops from the bloodhound operation. I cannot justify spending money on skins as they are a commodity and don't really improve anything for me. Additionally I spent quite a bit of money this month already on a couple of new books (Watchmen and Harper Lee's new book). Regardless I still like how skins look and would enjoy having more to play with.  Your favorite steam emote is :B1:, obviously...  Your least favorite game isn't bad rats, as you have 19 copies in your inventory. It could possibly be hack n' slash, as of the games you played it is one of the lowest and IMO wasn't very good.

I've gifted a few times here and on /r/pcmasterrace, and have been gifted 5 times.   Here is my Steam ID Here is a link to the game I want. Audiosurf 2. $15   Why I want the game  I'm a HUGE fan on Rock 'n Roll, and normally games like this only work with techno songs, at least when I try them.  I went ahead and searched for songs.  I looked for You Shook Me All Night Long by AC/DC.  I thought it was going to be a little game, like ""Yeah sure this is O.K.""  I found a live version, very high quality I should add, and I got INTO it!  This isn't just another one of ""those"" games.  This isn't a bust HA get it?? Rock or Bust? AC/DC's new album? eh, never mind. Moving on....  This game was well designed, and boy, when I turned up my headphones, I felt like I wasn't even at my house. I felt I was somewhere else, not even exaggerating!  I've been searching for you don't even know how long, for a game which takes a song you like, and plays along with it, and it's GOOD. This one surpasses my expectations so much I can't explain.  The different game modes as well, just absolutely genius and unbelievable! I love the ways you can change your space craft, choose different colors, all the different modes, like the casual mode especially.  I can't believe I found a game which finally gives me the experience I want.  There isn't much more I can say, but boy if you saw my face when the song kicked in and the game went from calm to fast pace and managed to get a picture.....you would be able to make fun of me sooo bad ;)  I also played The Long Run (by my favorite band ;) Eagles)  Oh my god - the pump, the beat, the sway, I can't even describe the way it played those songs, but it was phenomenal!!!  And oh, the multiplayer. Oh the multiplayer. I will admit I have yet to play the coop, but if you check my gameplay on steam, NBA 2K14, Mortal Kombat (which I have over 12 hours on), GTA V (over 60 hours), and plenty of more of my games have a ton of hours on them, and on all of these games, I have zero to 2 percent of single player mode gameplay finished. All of my gameplay is online because normally when I buy games, I buy them for the multiplayer.  I absolutely love the fact this game has multiplayer!  I saw in the previews two people running and one person controls one person and the other the other, and this to me takes this game to the next level!  This is the biggest part of the game to me.  Why can't I get it?  I have a friend who is Steam shared with me, and I though, ""Hey, I'll give this game a try."" I recently got kicked from my friend, he's playing his game now. I kind of told him I wanted to play and he told me to go buy the game. He just unshared with me :((((  And unlike my friends parents, if I want a game, I have to get it myself, I can;t just ask my parents for it and say ""I'll pay you back in work.""  Bonus:   I don't know emotes :(((( CS:GO   Thanks a whole bunch!"

So my account is only a day old and the only thing in it is the SSD I was planning on bringing in. Unfortunately, the person was supposed to return to my country and bring the SSD with him, won't be able to do it The game that I want is. This is my Amazon Wishlist As for what game I want: Fallout 4. I'll keep the reasons and whinings short since I'm sure you have better shit to do than read fake sad stories. but basically, I am inlove with Fallout 3 (I just spent 5 hours playing actually). Also, Fallout 3, Morrowind and Skyrim are all part of my top 5 games of all time. The problem is: 60$ is a lot of money and, while normally I would just wait for a summer sale, I really wanna play this as soon as it's available. I've been looking at other mediums through which I could get the game at a slightly lower price (for example: GMG has a 25% discount code for it but I fear I wouldn't get the key in due time or I would miss out on the pre-order bonus, which is very important if you wanna mod the game.) but it seems like the safest way to do it is to just pay full price on steam.   Anyways, thanks a lot for organising this sort of giveaways. I'm sure you'll make someone very happy!  EDIT: After looking at my steam profile, I should probably clarify something. Even though it says I've only played 1 hour of Fallout 3, I've actually played a lot more but I've ran the game through the FOSE which doesn't count towards steam's numbers. Also, a lot of people on reddit seem to be against the idea of pre ordering games and while I agree on principle, the truth is it makes no difference to me because I'm such a big fan that even if I have to wait a couple months to play the game, I'd still avoid reviews just in case they might spoil even a little bit."

However, it cost money. Lots of money (to me then) so, I didn't get it. And all I got to play of it was a few goof off sessions on a friends computer. Now, the price of it keeps going up. I would have been able to buy it nowadays at the price it was 3 years ago, but not the price it is now. My family has less extra money I wish we had, but I will not turn this into an ""I'm so poor story"", we are still better off than a lot of people. I am also not going to turn this into ""I'm a lazy broke ass teenager who doesn't want to get a job"" either. I sent in an application today to see if I could become a lifeguard at a local boys and girls club. University is coming up in a year and a half, and that costs money you know! Anyway, I am rambling on quite a bit here.  I'll wrap this up. Here is my amazon wishlist. As pathetic as it is :P  Now, your favourite steam emoticon, hmm... How about :ftlmantis: idk, it is right on your main profile page.  And finally, your least favourite game. It had better not be super meat boy! (your least played game) That is one of my favourite games of all time as well! Better add it to my list up above.  So, yeah. That's enough from me. I think. I ramble on a lot and loose my train of though, if you couldn't tell already. Thanks a lot for this awesome ga!"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Hellomynameis7,3,Fri Jul 17 03:17:40 2015 UTC,"My Steam ID   Hey. I kind of want CS:GO, if that is remotely possible. Woops, did not see the about me part! My bad. Well hi, my name is KKSlider24/Kukky2. I live in the very rainy state of Florida, where it never snows. I always loved gaming, ever since I was 8; Starting with good old Club Penguin and moving forward. My first console was a GameCube, but I never really played on it much because later we also got a Wii which was insane. I spent maybe days of my life playing on that Wii with my siblings. Anyways, I have a good education and get straight As with the occasional B (screw math D:) My favorite subject is anything Social Studies, really; Economics, Civics, World History. You name it. I intend to study law when the time comes. Anyways, that's all about me. Thanks for doing this charred! I want CS:GO because of 2 things: I like FPS games, and most of my friends play it and I would love to play alongside them. They don't have any games that I usually play on steam, but they do play CS:GO so I would love to join them in that. The reason I can't get the game is simply because of strict parents, I'm not really allowed to spend money online and if I am it's usually a cheap game ($10 or less, while CS:GO is 15$.) CS:GO Looks pretty interesting, I mean I am fairly certain I would enjoy the game a lot.   Well, thanks! :D Congrats on everything you have accomplished, I wish you the best in the future."

I really enjoy drawing, not that I'm any good, and writing, which I'm told I'm decent at. Above those, though, I extremely enjoy baking (I'd like to be a pastry chef some day).   This is my Steam profile. And I'd really love this game, Stonehearth    Why?   I'd buy it myself, but I don't have much in my actual wallet, much less my Steam wallet (which currently holds a whopping $0.24). Aside from that, I've found myself really interested in these sort of city-building games of late, and my good friend who bought it recently himself, has highly recommended it. And he's pretty good at predicting what I might enjoy. It looks like a neat little game, and I really, really enjoy managing things. I might be a bit of a micro-manager. Butwhatcanyoudo  Bonus:   I couldn't possibly guess. I have never once even touched Steam emotes. Is it CSGO?"

I played the first and absolutely loved it (never finished it because the game kept crashing in the last 10% of the game) but never had money to get the second one unfortunately. I realyl want to find out what happens in the next (and final?) installment of the series. I specifically avoided looking at the wiki or any youtube videos of it so I'll find out everything when I play it for the first time!  Least favorite, i'm guessing, is Gun Monkeys?"

Also, please don't buy me anything expensive or I'll feel really guilty about it :P  As for why I can't get any of these games myself at the moment, I'm currently a student under 18 whose mother is convinced that Steam is some kind of scam store and won't let me buy from it (even with my own money).

There, I'm people :D  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071631640 -Me  What I really wanna ask for is Rocket League, but it wouldn't be for me so damn. So what I'm gonna ask for is Kerbal Space Program, or LA Noire.   I want Kerbal because 4 years ago I think I received this download for the Alpha. Holy shit did I have fun with that game. The kicker is back then everything was SUPER basic. The full released version has so much crazy shit and things to do there is no reason I could ever NOT want it after my previous plays of it.   LA Noire because It's a game my girlfriend wants me to get so we can play through it together. She's a big crime show watcher like csi and stuff like that and she saw me watching a stream with that game and said she wants me to get it. Now this is huge to me cause this is the first time shes ever showed ANY interest in my gaming and thats awesome.  I can't get these cause I'm a broke ass college student, plain and simple lol.

Steam ID Mofo  You made me update my wishlist which i havent done in quite a while Here it is please dont judge the vinyl characters  The game i would like is Ark: survival evolved   I know many people think it is a bad game, badly optimized, badly planned, and badly executed. But i have been able to play for a about half an hour at a friends house and i was super excited because a youtuber i watch is also playing it at the moment and that made me want it all the more. incase you dont know what it is its a survival game where you start out naked(pretty sure there was a loin cloth) on an island inhabited by dinosaurs. You can tame all different beasts on the island so you might be able to fly on a pterodactyl or ride through the ocean on a megaladon or dolphin.   In this game you can build houses with wood make metal tools and find drops which may carry some supplies or blueprints. This game is heavily multiplayer and sadly most of the time i will be playing singleplayer due to wifi constrictions but i will also be getting my license and living at a friends houses who have da good wifi.

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,LuigiTheLord,3,Fri Jul 17 07:02:22 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm Apparati or Rob. I've been lurking here for a while and have gifted quite a few games in the past. I'm a very small time entertainment streamer that was recently laid off from my job. I am now working part time but it's mostly just covering my bills. Obligatory thank you for doing this, and here's my information:  Steam ID - http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsApparati/  Amazon wishlist - http://amzn.com/w/3HRX9W60CG1U  What game do you want from Steam? At the moment I'm playing Marvel Heroes 2015 and TERA, which are both free to play. Honestly, nothing I can think of right now on Steam that I want.  I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to enter this giveaway, congradulate you on your winnings, and say that you're awesome for sharing. As always, I wish everyone the best of luck and I feel someone will be walking away very happy from this, which is the best part about doing these giveaways!"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,harleysmoke,3,Fri Jul 17 07:02:32 2015 UTC,"Hi there and thank you for the giveaway :)   To introduce myself, I am young man with loads of interests that is going straith to his life and now is doing lots of decisions. For example, recently I built my computer that is beasly good, I decided to do a graphics work for a school magasine, I started to play on organ more frequently, and I became a double brother. Enough of changes in my life? I would say yes.. Also, I am from central Europe, so my english is not perfect and I cant (even if I try to) sometimes think and express myself that well as native speakers can. But that is not that big problem, is it?  The Game  The glorious game I would like to own is Elder Scrols; Skyrim. Why? I simly like games where you can do whatever you want, travel wherever you want on a big map and see those glorious landscapes during your walk. Like really! On my old computer when I played ""Test Drive - Unlimited"" on the setting that it could get, I remember traveling around the whole islad few times in all the cars that I could have and those views! I mean... Wow   Skyrim also has the great comunity of modders, that still make great content for the game, although the game is quite old. That gives us the opourtunity to mod the game, and actually fix those bugs that developers havent fixed yet, and to get whatever texthres and other things I would like to get. In that I see a great advantage. The game could evolve even more with this. Also on steam, I think it has some mods on steam workshop (that  are still not paid :D ) and I cant see that on much games I own.  The reasons  So the main question.. Why cant I get it myself? The answer is not that simple for me to give you.. Since I am no yet adult, I cant have a credit card (or at least my parents dont want me to have one) and so I cant add credit to my steam acount. In my country we even dont have those steam cards that you can reedem code of ant it will give you the credit. My parents dont want to enter the number of credit card to steam esither. That only gives me the option to buy games in brickshops, or to get games here from nice people.  Bonus  I guess that the basic one is your favorite. Why? It is simple and nice and you can express your smile wuth it.  Since bad rats are not your recent favorite game (cause it is not recenly released), It must be the NotGTAV. Why? Cause everybody loves it, and it is even better than Bad rats :)   That might be it for my entry. Hope I covered everything in here. Not to forget, here is my steam ID. Again, thank you for doing something like this, I really apreciate it :)   PS: I am sorry for your eyes if you found any grammatical or any other mistake in my entry. I tryed not to make any, but even though I lear english for over 10 years now, I stil make mistakes, and writing on my mobile dont make it easier"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,CinnamonUranium,3,Fri Jul 17 08:09:41 2015 UTC,"Steam ID I don't have an Amazon wishlist but I guess the frogs they have over there would be nice as a pet... I would like a copy of Rust. I've recently written up a request here and TL;DR is that I love the genre and style of the game as well as the new mechanics it adds. I want to play it with my friends, and I'm currently unemployed so pretty much all of my money goes straight to Mum to help pay for bills and the rest goes towards transport, money for IRL friends' birthday cards and the occasional game on Steam. The game interests me because my friends play it and it looks pretty fun too!   BONUS ROUND   It's obviously :miyu:, I mean, look at that adorable waifu Judging by your review, it's gotta be Super Crate Box.   I'm going to pull out as my request post was fulfilled.

My steam would be: http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaTM  Does amazon even work in Poland?  The game I'd like the most is Rust.   You're asking why would i want that game. I'll anwser with a question and ask why Wouldn't I want that game. It's open world, Multiplayer, Has crafting in it, It has a whole bunch of dicks, It has a whole bunch of male genitalia and is overall IMO the best game out of all the Open world Survival Multiplayer games. (Dog went away from me :C)  Why cant' I get it? Well that's beacuse I don't really have the money for it, Neither does my Mother. Even if my father  does have enough spare money for me to buy it sadly he's pissed off to a diffrent home and now my parents are apperantly divorcing  TL;DR I don't have the dosh to get it.  I do have CS:GO so I can take the skins  Alright, The bonus rounds.  My shot at your faorite emote is :creep:  Your least Favorite will be... Hmm... Batman: Arkham Asylum I guess...  Well there's that. It's alot longer than I thought"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,SOMMARTIDER,3,Fri Jul 17 09:11:02 2015 UTC,"Hey and thanks for what you are doing!   My name is uTukan, or outside, in the real word, they call me Matěj, I come from the Czech Republic, more exactly from North-Western part where the mountains are. I am 15 year old student (Yes, I know, I am a youngster) who loves gaming for a really long time. I don't really know how to compose this in to the text so here are things that I enjoy!: It's gaming (obviously), biking, swimming (I have done both of these competitively in the past), flipping  butterfly knives and also betting CSGO skins on csgolounge.com (which if I win, will make sure not to do with your skin, because of the, should I say memory value? Yes, that's probably it.   Anyways, I am hoping to win a CSGO skins since I started getting back to it and playing a lot recently (have the game since October 2013 where I only bhopped and surfed without playing any competitive matches, oh how silly I was) and so far I have 620 hours and counting. I bet a lot on csgolounge, but low-end skins, the biggest value skin I have ever bet was USP Guardian ST MW ($2.00) and it got back to me with some 0.80$ skin. I recently bet 0.24$ (IIRC) value on F3 when F3 vs NiP (don't take me wrong, I love NiP from the bottom of my heart) at 9:91 odds and I won AWP | Worm God with Dreamhack and fnatic sticker, Pro90 Pulse and some more skins, I was so lucky, if I went all in, I would get about $39, but betting on F3 was rather a joke, and it turned out good!  Hope I didn't bore you with my CSGO talk, but if you actually want to read more about me, here is my intro thread!  Steam ID   If I would like to win CSGO skin, should I answer the same question, only with ""skin"" instead of ""game""? I will just do both if you don't mind.   What game do you want from Steam? Why do you want it? Why can't you get it yourself? (for that question, answers such as ""I spent all my only on [item] are ok."") Why does it interest you?   If I actually win, I would love Rocket League.  The game just looks good and everybody said that when they bought it, it was even better. It might look like silly game, but all the fun it possibly holds is uncontrollable. I know a lot of streamers which were really skeptic when people told them to buy it, but when they finally did, they played it for about 12 hours straight!   Why can't I get it myself? Because all of my (I get it, my parents money who gave it to me) money got spend on a new balisong/butterfly knife, since the first one I ever had, I didn't know a think about them, I just wanted to flip and I bought the wiggliest one you can ever purchase. I am now finally happy flipping!   What skin do you want from Steam? Why do you want it? Why can't you get it yourself? (for that question, answers such as ""I spent all my only on [item] are ok."") Why does it interest you?   It doesn't really matter which skin, it's really up to you, you can check my inventory and see the skins I have. If you want to, of course it can be skin for weapon I already have in skin.   Hint: My favorite guns in order from best to not-so best: M4A1-S, AWP, AK-47,   Hint 2: I like the looks of kind of futuristic looking skins, such as Hyper Beast, Asiimov (not saying you should get me some of these, they are pretty damn expensive haha) Evil Daimyo, Redline, Elite Build, Dragon King and so on, I hope it gave you at least some idea.   Hint 3: I don't really like the looks of these really worn guns (not as BS or WW cond. but as the official skin), or these extremely colorful guns such as Cartel, Boreal Forest, X-ray, Bright Water et cetera. Other points, I guess are the same as the first version with Rocket League.  Once again, thanks for what you're doing and congratulations for the wins in CSGOJackpot, the amount of money that gets dropped there is insane.  EDIT: If I somehow win, which would be extremely awesome, it will be next Friday, right? And I am not exactly sure if I will have access to internet, since I am leaving to Slovakia and then to Hungary, it should be on Saturday, but damn I am not sure! So in advance, I am extremely sorry if I won't respond, but you better know that I would be happy even if I coudn't answer!  EDIT2: Nevermind, I'm here until Saturday afternoon :)"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,FusRoeDah,3,Fri Jul 17 09:12:23 2015 UTC,Damn this is a great giveaway. I'd enter but I'm out of the country and I'm sure there are people who deserve this more than me.   Good luck.
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,reynardthafox,3,Fri Jul 17 09:31:38 2015 UTC,"Introduction and links  I'm Eden. It's not just a username. I've been a member of GoG for about two and a half years. I'm a mod over at /r/RandomKindness. I'm a member of a bunch of other gifting/help communities too. I've gifted almost 180 items on Reddit, which sounds like a lot more than it is since it was mostly small stuff. I like being able to help out where I can, which is why I started off by gifting cheap things like Sonic Adventure 2 and bundle games, since it was what I could afford. I've been gifted quite a few games too, including one of my favourites which I couldn't have afforded on my own; ArmA 3.  I'm currently in the process of moving out of my family home and into an apartment, so I've been having to buy almost everything. Amazon has come in pretty useful, as has eBay and second-hand sales.  I lived in Korea and Japan for some time for work. I was teaching English as a foreign language (related to my degree), but now I'm a trainee working with gas and electric. I just recently passed my 'Gas Safe' exams.  I enjoy co-op gaming most of all. I think the most fun in gaming is to be playing with friends. I've been living out of a hotel for most of the weeks since March but that's about to end soon. There's no-one I know in this town, so I'll soon be looking for some similar time zone (or playing time) people to play co-op with.   I enjoy PC gaming and console gaming too. I bought a PS4 a while back because it was on price error and thus much cheaper than I'd get it even on sale. It was one of those 'I can't really afford it, but I'm going to get one eventually and better now than later' situations. I don't actually own any games for it. I own a Wii U, which I really enjoy. I recently bought an XBox (original, not 360 or One) because my sister was going to trade it in for £7 and I wanted to play Toejam and Earl III, as well as replay Shenmue II and the original Halo. Again, currently no games. I still own my PS2 and pull it out on occasion.   The Game  It's the top of my wishlist; Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain. It's not currently available, but you said any game, so I'm hoping it's still okay to ask for that as it becomes available. There's talk of it being announced for being bundled with GPUs soon, so hopefully it'll be purchasable soon.  I mentioned before that I've been moving out and living out of a hotel most of the time since March. I've still managed to play 9.5 hours of Ground Zeroes (often called the demo for Phantom Pain). That might not sound like much, but how long to beat puts beating the main story at 1h 41m. It's possible to beat in 10m. Main + extras at 6h 30m. I still want to play it more too.  Metal Gear Solid was my first stealth game and the one that got me into the genre. I've owned MGS 1 for PS1, MGS 2 for PS2, MGS 3 for PS2 and 3DS and even MGS Peacewalker for PSP. Taking the tactical stealth approach is a big part of why I enjoy the games, but I also really enjoy the silly little things like shooting toy frogs in MGS 3, hiding under boxes and the fourth wall breaking. The challenges to add re playability are great too.  Talking about MGS V: PP itself, rather than the whole as a series, I enjoyed the base building aspects in Peacewalker which are being translated to MGS V:PP. The fulcum system, where you kidnap people and try to convert them to your own side is particularly fun. I usually tried to knock out and take as many people as I could.   While I haven't had the chance to play MGS 4, I have played Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes which are directly before V:PP in the time line and I want to see what happens next in the story. If you're not a fan of the series, the timeline is kind of odd. It goes; MGS3 > MGS Portable Ops > MGS Peace Walker > MGS V: GZ > MGS V: PP, Metal Gear > Metal Gear 2 > MGS >MGS 2 >MGS 4.  Talking about the story, that's another aspect that I enjoy. At times it's a bit over the top 'action movie' style, but it actually has a pretty deep story beneath that. MSG 3 in particular.  Why I can't buy it? The costs of moving into an apartment and other things. I've spent money on movers, a bed, a fridge freezer, a deposit and quite a lot of smaller things like plates, cutlery, cups, a bin, net curtains, curtains and loads more that just keeps adding up.  Bonus  While I could make an educated guess that Robocraft is your favourite game on Steam, least favourite is harder. I'll go with Super Crate Box.  Favourite emote? I'm guessing there's not an Anna emote, so make an ice flake?  Notes  As a note, I own CS:GO but don't play it that often. If the skins are intended as Steam wallet, awesome. If they're intended to actually be used in play, better for someone else to win them.   I have the retro Sega games and RPG Maker bundle stuff already, except for Sonic Racing, but I have Transformed (which is the best kart racing game), so no interest in that.  Thanks for reading and the offer."

Steam Account:https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132041668/  Hi, I'm /u/DJSkrillex (I'm not the real Skrillex, I just think his name sounds cool)! A second ago you didn't know I existed, but now you're reading my words. In my mind, you aren't a real person. Like you said, we're all a bunch of words on the internet. It's so cool to think about that. Billions of years of evolution led to this moment.   So, I recently bought CS:GO and I've played 9 hours. It's really addictive, but I don't have any skins. It'd be really cool if you could give me a M4A4 or an AK-47 skin. Doesn't matter how much it costs.  I think GTA V is a great game, but the price tag ruins everything. I'd be very grateful if you could gift it to me."

Personality wise I am a pretty calm down-to-earth guy. Pragmatic. I'm no fan of drama and I am honest about what I think. I enjoy talking and playing games with people. I like watching movies, horror and sci-fi are my favorite genres.   Obviously, I love gaming in general. I have probably put more than 10000 hours into games. I started out with console gaming and worked my way up to PC gaming in 2006~. The games I am most hyped for are Fallout 4 and Dishonored 2, both Fallout: NV and Dishonored residing in my top 5 game list. I currently play Dota, Civ V, Speedrunners and some Fallout:NV.   The game  I want to ask you for Rocket League. This game was recently released and I have kept my eye on it since then. I would describe it as football with cars. I've watched people stream it and they always have a good time. It is the top seller on Steam right now which should tell you how loved it is. It looks very much like a game I could play with my girlfriend, which is the main reason I'm asking for it. We currently only play Dota and Speedrunners together and that is getting old.   They plan to add lots of content to the game and the best part is that only the cosmetics will cost anything! I love games that do DLC right and this is one of them. There's also music in this game and similar to Payday 2 it gets you hyped and ready for action.   I can't really afford buying any games since I live at home and I'm saving up. I would need two copies to play with my SO but if I were gifted one I can buy a copy for her. I know that we would love playing this game.   Final words  Thanks for doing this giveaway Charred, you are great and awesome. :)  I was originally going to ask for Fallout 4 since I love Fallout: New Vegas but I don't know if my request is good enough.   I want you to know that if you choose me I would play the shit out of Rocket League. This is a game I think everyone should pick up and play, specially if you have friends you can team up with.  Steam Amazon Wishlist I made for the Amazon sale"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,deathsay,2,Fri Jul 17 11:25:14 2015 UTC,"The only game currently that I'd like to win is the witcher 3 so here we go.  LINK TO THE GAME!  STEAM ID!  Beginning of the game!                                            **REQUEST**   Have you ever seen something, but not really spectated for more than a couple of seconds and there in that moment after only a glimpse you knew that this was the thing you were looking for so long? For so long sounds slighly overexaggerated since I've only been gaming for like 10 years (yes super mario counts as gaming, deal with it), but considered it's more than half of my life (16 years old) it's a fair amount of time. When I was a child I liked exploring and the fact I lived in a village made it possible to do so. I used to wonder around in nature all by myself and just enjoy in the beautiful nature not even knowing how careless I was back then. Chasing butterflies and picking up flowers for the cute girl nextdoor, yeah that's something I could, if given the opportunity, get back to in a snap. I was read a lot of fairytales when I was a child and apart from Andersen's and the Grimm brother's stories I really liked the traditional serbian ones. Most of them possess princesses and princes, dragons, snakes, swords, axes and in majority of the cases the good guy wins and saves the day by killing the mythical creature. Now imagine if you could do that, be the good guy, save your girl in a badass style and get paid while doing so, come on you have to admit it sounds pretty cool. I remember my first open world game Gates of Andaron I literaly got lost with my first created characted I wondered so far that I didn't know how to get back so I just created a new one. After that I tried a little bit of Skyrim, Minecraft, TERA, AION, Assasins Creed, Far Cry, Gothic, NFS, Prototype (this list is endless so let's just stop here). There is something about those open world games that holds you, maybe the feeling of freedom or possibility of choices I'm not entirely sure. The fact that you can have multiple choice dialogue makes this game even better because you can actually choose the parts of the story you want to see and which not. In other words you can finish this game 3 times and you still won't play ""exactly"" the same game, which is in my opinion pretty damn awesome. For the bookworms out there, there is also a serie of witcher books, unfortunately they aren't really accessible in Serbia but as soon as I can grab one for myself I will. I can't really comment on how well does the game represent the books so I won't. Before a couple of months my friends dragged me to the cinema and we watched the seventh son, if you want a movie of a witcher that's the one you should definetly look into.                                       The Witcher 3 story The first thing you aknowledge when seeing the game is the awesome graphics it provides. It's absolutely stunning. It requires a decent video card but if you don't really care about the fabulous hair flopping (hairworks) it will run on decent settings without spending your retirement fond. I truly adore every aspect of this game, but the biggest pro of this game is it's story. I mean honestly, who doesn't like a good story, it doesn't matter if it's a book, movie, series or game a good story will be recognized and rewarded. That is exactly what happened with witcher 3. Compared to some other game budgets like Destiny and GTA 5 , the creators of witcher made an awesome job on assembling it all together. So let's get into the story of the witcher 3. You are having a nightmare about Kaer Morhen - a witcher school where you, Geralt of Rivia, have spent time learning how to become a witcher. You are dreaming about your beloved, Yeneffer and your not blood bounded daughter Ciri, that might be learning how to become a witcher without permission. Ciri, after she has been taken back to Vesemir, gets kidnapped by the phantom army and just as you want the story to go on you wake up by a campfire, sitting next to your mentor Vesemir - an old witcher. He asks what's the matter and you explain him (or don't depends on your dialogue decision). You're a bit shaken up but you are alright, you get a letter in which you are summoned to Vizima. You are looking for Yeneffer but she actually finds you after a tavern incident. She tells you that Emhyr var Emeris, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, has summoned you to Vizima. When you get there you get a task to find your daughter who has already started the wild hunt. That's the moment when you also do the same thing. I didn't want to spoil the game anymore for all of you who actually want to give it a go. This is the only game I want currently, I know it's expensive and that it's quite greedy of me to ask for it but if there is a slightest chance of me getting the possibility to play it I will go for it. If you decide to play the game please don't forget to play out (or walkthrough) the first two parts of the game just to have all the dots connected, but the third part is a story for itself. Thank you for doing this /u/charredgrass and the last thing I wanted to say is that I already submitted this story to another giveaway which I didn't win so I really hope you won't get angry for my copypasta but this is how I got into the witcher games and I couldn't put it better into words than I already have. Good luck to everyone."

I like to keep most of my private life away from the internet, so there's not much more to say.  ID     Elite Dangerous. Or Rocket League. (Because why not) I'd really like to spice up my Steam library and I'm getting pretty bored playing the same games again and again. I can't afford because one of my birds got sick, and animal treatment is not cheap. Since the vetenarian didn't know much about birds it passed away, and I didn't want my other bird to get depresssed so I bought a new one. (sorry for trying to guilt trip you :P) I have never been really interested in space games but this one really caught my interest. From what I've heard the game is like Euro Truck Simulator but in space, which sounds absolutely fantastic. Also I like first person games.   Thanks my darling :D"

I spent some time studying IT, but I quit. I spend most of my free time listening to various genres of music, mostly electro, and playing video games. Right now I am listening to Hammock albums, which I really recommend. I am a ""lone wolf"" in games, but I also enjoy co-op ,which led me to spending time with friends playing fighting games. The start was rough, but I quickly grasped basics  I'm a new member of GOG community. I made one giveaway though to contribute in making this subreddit even better than it is now(is it possible?) I don't even remember how I ended up here, but community is great so I decided to stay here longer :)  The game I want:Guilty Gear Accent Core plus RGuilty gear is just spectacular. I've spent countless hours on it and I still want more. I'm so bad in it, but it gives me lot of fun. Despite being old it has nice graphic, very fast pace and many crazy character designs.  My favourites so far are Chipp zanuff and Millia Rage. Well, they're kinda similar, so I'm looking for some different character to play.   I can't afford it currently, because my phone broke. It takes priority over other things, so until I get a new or repair current one - no buying games :/  Favourite emoticon: my vote goes on :coolness:   Least favourite game: hint is ""not bad rats"", and it is a puzzle physics game, so I think you don't like portal  My Steam ID  Here's myAmazon wishlist.

I'm a student right now and my dream is to be able to move out of the country and know as many cultures and people as posible.   The game      I want Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition.  Why do I want it?  I've heard only good things about this game, and being a major fan of rpg/Jrpg I really want to play it. The atmosphere of the game really sell me out, being settled in a post apocalyptic world and open map giving you free to go anywhere you want to go is the most important thing about the game that interest me.  Why can't I get it myself?  I can not buy the game because of exchange control my country, it is very difficult to get dollars through legal channels and the black market is worse because the dollar costs too much because inflation affecting the country at this time and the whole political situation in general  My steam ID  Thanks for this and for being so awesome!"

I like cars, and I've just  been accepted in college, where I'm going to study Mechanical Engineering ('cause I like cars). I also like computers and games.   The game I want is BeamNG.drive.   Why?: Because it's a soft body physics simulator, but I'll use it for driving mostly, and has plenty of cars and maps, and mod support, to make sure it'll be used. It's early access and is regularly updated. Well, buy it then : I was going to, I swear, but I ran out of money because I bought a new GFX, some games in the steam sale, and also I'm getting my driving license (my highest priority right now, as I like cars) Why does it interest you?: I think this is the same as the first question, so I'll answer to How did that game catch your attention? instead. Well, Gabe, the main developer of BeamNG (I think) was a very good carmaker for the Open Source soft body physics game Rigs of Rods, and I loved all his work. So when I found he was going in in this serious project I wanted to be part of it. Your favourite steam emote is: :B1: , because it's the fucking coolest mate. Your most hated game is: CS:GO, because it made you win money. JK, maybe one of those early access zombie survival games?"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,theredvip3r,2,Fri Jul 17 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a 21 years old English Major who is studying in the Philippines. I used to be an architecture student. Every summer break, I begged my parents to let me shift to another program because I felt nothing with architecture. I failed a couple of times because every project felt like work. I didn't want to do something that made me sigh with exasperation everytime a professor gave us a project. After 3 years, I got kicked out of the university I was in (which was a very expensive and high class university) because I failed most of the math subjects. My parents didn't take that as a hint and made me enroll to this lesser known university in hopes of getting me back to that more known university. After a year, my parents finally asked me what I wanted to do, so I chose to study Linguistics. I'm 2 semesters in, and so far, I am loving it. I get to experience art in another perspective. I know some westerners might see me in the same light as art majors, but since I live in Asia, being fluent in English is a skill sought by many. So far, I'm content.  Steam  I don't have an Amazon account.  I would love to have Life is Strange Complete Season! I've always loved episodic, decision games since Telltale's Walking Dead. Telltale Games are good, but I feel like there isn't much consequence or the choices there are just for show and aesthetics. Ultimately, all the stories in Telltale Games end in one way or the other regardless of the choices you made in previous episodes. Life is Strange looks like it nailed the whole genre by combining choice making and time travel. It's just a perfect combination that I just have to play it for myself. So far, since I always watch Telltale Games on YouTube, I managed to avoid any Life is Strange spoilers except the few minutes in game.  I can't get it for myself because I spent most of my money on bills.  I lurked a lot in the group chat, but I never got to chat with you (If I did chat with you, I can't remember). I'm guessing it's the whole Summer Sale rainbow emotes!  I'm guessing your least favorite game on Steam is... not Bad Rats?  Thanks for another awesome giveaway!"

Especially strategy games, be it RTS, turn-based or grand strategy. I also enjoy playin' a couple of rounds of CS:GO with my friends after a hard day's work. Top banter! (I also dig British jabs for some weird reason m8).  The game that I would like to get my hands on is any newer Total War title, be it Attila or Rome II, but they are god-damn expensive as hell, and they never go on a big sale, because they are new sadly. The reason I enjoy TW games so much is because there is no better feeling than acting like a great general and sending a thousand stack army into certain death, I mean glorious victory! Also I spent all my money on CK2 and EU4 (no regrets!)  Bonus round: Your favorite steam emote is :miyu: 100% IT MUST BE!  and your most hated steam game is... TF2, no... CS:GO, no...

ID: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066907267/  Well, the game I have most wanted for a really long time now is Divinity Original Sin. See, the game looks absolutely amazing, and not only in the actual physical (Or should I say virtual, heh) appearance, but also because it seems like a type of game I would endlessly love. The combat of the game looks most amazing, and I love the progression as well. And not to mention I have also seen a tad bit of gameplay and livestreams to confirm how well it would match my liking.   As for why I haven't bought the game yet? Well, that one is rather easy, Grass. I just haven't had enough money on my steam account at a time to cover the cost, hah, though I have been saving up all that I can in my account now. Those summer sales were hard to resist, yo!  And the main reason this game interests me, is because it reminds me of how much fun I had playing games like torchlight or diablo, but with an interesting flavour to it to make it more unique than the two.  And your favourite steam emote, is CLEARLY the Solar emote from Awesomenauts. (If it isn't, at least it is mine!)  And your least favourite game is clearly not Bad Rats, I hear way too many good things about it! Your least favourite game is clearly G Mod!  Awesome giveaway, mate!"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,SOMMARTIDER,2,Fri Jul 17 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm Palad. I'm a middle-aged IT tech from the US midwest. I'm ACMT certified and currently spend a good part of my workday repairing MacBook Airs for high school students who think they can lie to me about spilling a coke on their machine.  But I know.  I always know.   I've been playing computer games since Castle Wolfenstein on the Apple ][. I was in the middle of Baldur's Gate when I met my (now) wife, and she couldn't understand how I could spend hours staring at a computer screen. It didn't take long to make her a convert, and all three of our kids have been raised in the Way of the Game.  Role-playing games have always been my favorite, and the top game on my wishlist is currently Pillars of Eternity. You can read my earlier request for it here if you're interested. TL;DR is that RPGs have always been my favorite, and this one follows in the vein of some of m best-loved titles.  I have a lot of games in my Steam account. Mostly, they're from bundle purchases, and I added them to Steam when I first got them because, why not? Some I've bought during Steam sales but never got around to playing. A few are there as an act of penance for pirating them when I was younger.   With all the bills that come with having a family, I still don't spend much money on games. I'll toss out a dollar to get the base tier of Humble Bundles if there's something that interests me. Occasionally I'll go as high as five dollars for the BTA tier if it has a really cool title in it. I almost never spend more than $10, though, even during the Steam sales, because my family needs groceries and health insurance more than I need games. (Brief soapbox here: Even with my employer's contribution, I pay as much for my health insurance premiums as I do for my home mortgage. Plus I get to spend $40-80 per visit out-of-pocket. If I weren't upside-down on my house, I would seriously consider moving to Canada just for the health care.)  That's basically it. I'm sure my kids wouldn't go hungry if I spent $30 or $40 on a game. Our lights wouldn't get shut off, we wouldn't lose the house, and the world wouldn't end. But we also don't have any significant savings. I feel like I have to prioritize my spending to accommodate what might happen down the road and to prevent us from ever getting to a point where my family would have to do without. I haven't bought a new-new game in years - in order to justify the purchase, I have to wait until they've been out for some time and the price has dropped below what I would spend at McDonald's. My wife and I go out to eat once a year, we go to the movies less often than that, and we keep having to remind my parents that we don't have cable or Netflix, because these things are luxuries we feel we can't afford. I would love to buy Pillars of Eternity and spend the next several weeks lost in its world, but instead I will have to buy a new pair of boots because my current ones are three years old and falling apart.   But it's all about the importance we put on things, isn't it? My son and I go on a road trip each year to my hometown, because that one-on-one time is really important to him. We take the whole family to our local Ren Faire each year, in costume, because it's one of those traditions we started when my wife and I were dating. We all have to decide which things in our lives get priority. As much as I love gaming, it's had to be pushed farther down the list the older I get. That's why I can't get my number one game for myself.   I think what you're doing here is great. I love seeing the generosity on this sub. Thanks for the opportunity!  Oh yeah, I'll edit in my Amazon wishlist when I have a moment to look it up."

I want to prove to myself that I know better than they do.  Also, I started playing GTA way back when, when Chinatown wars first came out for DS. I don't know why everyone hates that game. It's good!  After my DS broke I started back up again on my iPod Touch. When that broke I stopped, but I want to get back into it again.

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,legendcy1337,2,Fri Jul 17 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Steam ID  I would like to ask for the game making bundle. I'm currently taking up a programming course and I've got projects coming up for this semester and the next.  I should have graduated years back but I've had to stop going to school a few times for several different reasons. Now I'm back and it's a lot harder or maybe it's just not what it used to be. Last time I made a decent sized program was way back about a decade ago. i was learning C, java, assembly, and several scripting languages. We used to do everything from scratch, nowadays you can just drag and drop a few buttons and boxes and voila you have your very own web browser. Damn it, it took me several hours just to make my own version of notepad in C. It's amazing though! What a group of people used to do can be done by just one person now, faster and sometimes even better. Problem is I'm utterly clueless about all these new stuff, specially mobile development. But I so want to learn!  I have a few subjects now related to game development and each have several requirements including a ""finished game"", not really finished think of it like early access, by the end of semester for each subject. This is also my first time making an actual game, most of the thing we did were systems, databases, and web applications. I'm finding myself needing more tools for game development and I'm hoping that I could expand on this with the game making bundle.  Thank you for doing this giveaway and thanks for the chance! Happy gaming! :D  Edit: I'm not able to acquire it myself because I'm a working student now and budget is tight as it is.  Edit 2: Not really interested in the games in the bundle. I'm just after the Dev Tools specifically App Game Kit 2 and the assets packs: Modern DLC Pack, Sci-Fi DLC Pack, Fantasy DLC Pack, New DLC Pack, Starter DLC Pack.   May I ask for more than one app in the bundle? It would be awesome to hav Spriter Pro, Sprite Lamp and Pro Motion 6.5 so that it'll be easier for me to make and edit sprites since I'm not really good at those. RPG Maker VX Ace Deluxe Edition and Game Character Hub would be great but I won't be using them till about mid next year."

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Renal_Toothpaste,2,Fri Jul 17 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"Hello,  First of all, I would like to thank you for doing such a huge and all-rounded giveaway and giving the props to the mods  , which always do their job and keep this community really clean, close and fun. It truly feels like a community and it warms my heart that people are always so cheerful, happy and nice to each other here. I sometimes get nervous, mad or/and start being a real asshole to the people of the internet, but this place acts for me as /r/eyebleach, seeing all the happy people, people who are happy because they got a game they couldn't afford and seeing the big Santas here warms my heart after a lot of hate I endure and cause others. There is nothing more but to admire you, the mods and all the other people in the community.  Well, now that my rant (which came out longer than expected) is over,  I will try to introduce myself.  Introduction  Hello once again,  I am a 17 year old high school student. I am an introvert, I'm really shy near new people and really bad at communicating with my friends, so I spend most of my time playing video games. As an introvert, I have social struggles like not being able to hold an eye contact, keeping my body language up and normal and all other jazz. I am also that kind of dude who likes to talk more than do something physical with my friends. Sadly, most of my friends ar not like that. I have 3 real friends out of which one is in a summer camp right now, one is living 10km from me so it's troublesome and another one is working almost all the time and is very popular. That's why I hang out not a whole lot and play video games.  Surprisingly, I find no problems communicating with my friends online. I don't get tired, I don't piss them off with my lame jokes. It's just easier for me to talk through the internet than in real life. There is also a bigger choice of friends on the internet than in my school, because nobody needs to wear a mask and there are millions of other people who might be similiar to me. It is more fun chatting all day with a Finnish friend online than a real friend because he doesn't care that my whole school used to bully me and I have social anxieties because of that. I can also tell such things to him and he will help me overcome my anxities, not laugh off them.  Anyways, since I already sit in front of the blue screen so much, I also try to take useful skills from me. For example, I started playing CS:GO with my new friends online. I instantly asked them to play with Teamspeak. Why? Because my English accent was terribad. I played daily with them for a few months and last time my real life friend heard me speak English, he said I speak like a Briton. I learnt English itself through the power of the internet, not only pronounciation. My grammar sucks big time, but my vocabulary is huge, thanks to the internet of course.   I tried other hobbies, but nothing hits close to gaming. I tried guitar, I played trumpet and flugelhorn for years, even played in the best fanfare orchestra in my country. Played football when I was little. As much as I still love to take my trumpet in my hands and I feel like a free bird when running with a football in front of me, gaming is my favourite thing. Period.  In a simple way, I am a weak 17 year old kid with good grades, who's spending most of his time playing video games, watching TV shows, studying and working out at home. I don't party, drink or smoke, only sometimes, when I get into some kind of party-like environment, which happens only like once a year. Now I will talk about me in video games and I hope I will contain myself and won't rant that much haha.  Gaming me  I am a competitor I love all sorts of games, but give me an any type of game with competitive environment like LoL, Dota2, CS:GO or Hearthstone and I will like it. Whether it's strategy, rhythm, sports or anything, if the game is built around challenging the other team or a player, I will always love it. It's strange though, because I am usually mediocre at all of competitive games. However, such games makes me want to get better and it's fun doing research online about little details in the games to get better.  I am a rhythm game enthusiast. I love Osu! It's a pretty hard game where you have to click circles according to the rhythm. It's mechanically hard, some players get Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, but at the same time, it's very rewarding and fun. I dislike anime, but I like Japanese music so this game is perfectlt fit for me. I am playing it for 13 months now and I have never been bored with it for longer than 1 day.  I am an immersive type of guy. I love adventure. One of my favourite games are World of Warcraft because of the big and beautiful world I can explore. I was a noob at the game because my favourite part was exploring the new zones and seeing new places. Once I would get to max level, I would start leveling reputation and get achievements because I loves the game so much I wanted to know about every faction and every corner of it. I would just go around and farm achievements while chatting with guild buddies. I miss it. I should get back to wow.  So yeah, that's me... It took me 50 minutes to write up to this point. Moving forward.  What to write next? Well, I could guess your favourite steam emote and steam game next I guess!  Favourite game: I would say it's CS:GO. You have enough skins to win a jackpot twice. You invest into this game. You either invest money or time to gamble/trade so many skins. I'm pretty sure you love the game. It might be another game, but hey, you did say you won the CS:GO jackpot, so I only have one lead to guess the game haha.  Favourite emote: I don't know. A lot of emotes are bad. I will guess that an emoge from PAYDAY games because their emotes are cool (or so I remember) or :csgogun:, which is my favourite emote, probably because it's one of the two emotes I have and the other one is :markath:, which is just an insignia.  My requests   First of all, I would like to ask for a CS:GO skin. I absolutely love CS:GO and I have skins for all of my favourite weapons but one. I have Nitro for M4, Safari Mesh for AWP, Mendhi for P250, but I don't have an AK skin. I don't need any expensive skins because I don't think I'm worth them, but something like a Cartel would be very cool. I love CSGO, but spending even more money on skins would really be disrespectful to my family. Sure, I have my money, but I can use the same money to buy a tasty meatstick or something so everyone in my home would benefit from it. Secondly, I would like to ask for Rocket League! It's a very cool game which I saw on stream. Basically, it's car football, but finally, some developer finally made it work! I saw hundreds of versions of car football, but this one is the only one that looks good, seems smooth and fun. Also, it's competitive! It seems like a game I would DEFINITELY like. I love football and I love video games. This game combines the two and puts fun as a cherry on top. It's amazing!  My Amazon Wishlist: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/16SIFDJ3S6L8U/ref=topnav_lists_1 I added the item today because I didn't know wishlist is a thing on Amazon! As much as I would like a new mouse, I don't want you to buy me such expensive things to me so I kept the mousepad. It's still pretty expensive, but hey, maybe if I get lucky... I need a big mousepad because I have a cornertable. It's big so my whole hand lays on it. It's really uncomfortable to play Osu! or CSGO on a small mousepad on a big table. That's why I want QcK+ - it's big and proven to be good. The reason why I can't get these myself is because I live in a country that is not well economically developed. I have no problem buying food products or local things like books or magazines, but international prices are too much. What $10 is for you feels like $30 for us. Our minimal wage is €300. I have a part-time job, so I get €170. I can't buy games like Rocket League for €20 or mousepads that are €23 with shipping. My morale doesn't allow me. It just feels disrespectful towards my parents, who still have most furniture, oven and TV older than me. I might as well handle those €20 to them. Getting a new mouse or a mousepad would be cool, but my parents might also want a frying pan for €100. However, dreams are dreams and we have to use things adjusted to our quality of life. That's just how it is.   Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my rant! It's good to be back to this community. I remember I used to even cut snowflakes out of paper with my mom for games in this subreddit! It took me 70 minutes to write this request and I won't care if I win nothing. I had a lot to think about today and thinking, writing this post made me stop thinking about a lot of stuff and made my evening better. It also made me kind of write all my thoughts out on paper regarding my online friendships and such. I think I will sleep well tonight. I hope you will too.  Good night,  www.steamcommunity.com/id/Yurop64"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,AmirZ,2,Fri Jul 17 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"Steam ID Introduction Hello! I am /u/conanap, and I am a Chinese Canadian residing in the Ontario province. I will be attending university this coming school year at University of Toronto, for Computer Science Co-op. I love flying, driving (specifically drifting), and astronomy. I do not have a telescope, so I just stargaze at night, trying to make out which stars are which (which wasn't that hard with an app). I also like computer programming (hence why I'm going into computer science), playing instruments, tennis, and of course gaming. I've been in the Air Cadet Program for 4 years, in which I've gotten my Gliders Pilot License and Private Pilot License from through their Glider Pilot Scholarship and Power Pilot Scholarship. I retired this year as a flight sergeant, and am planning to become either a Civilian Instructor / Volunteer or a CIC officer. I hope to become a full time airline pilot flying long distance flights or any sort of airliner will satisfy me. My favorite games are LOL, KSP, and CS:GO. Amazon wishlist I do not have an Amazon wishlist. Game? I would like Dirt Rally from Code Masters. Like I've mentioned before, I'm a huge fan of driving/racing/drifting, so Dirt Rally is right up my alley (yay for rhyme!). However, I'm not a big fan of too arcady games, with the exception of NFS Undercover. I like sim games like real racing, KSP, MFSX, etc., so instead of the older Dirt games, which were a little more arcade and less sim, I would much prefer Rally. The great thing about Dirt Rally, you might say I'm burning Code Master rn, is that this isn't another sh.tty console port. I have nothing against consoles, but CM's ports are straight terrible (F1 2015, for example). With Rally starting as an early access on PC, it already has a much better quality than other ports that CM produced. There isn't a lot of cars or tracks in this game, but what it has, it does it great. CO pilots (drivers, if you will) react to things happening in real time, eg they would stop talking and hold their breath as the car jumps, and talk calmly when you're driving rather smoothly. There's full support for wheels (which I'll get later in the year after I have some more money), and the physics are rather accurate. The game is simply fantastic; while the scenery graphics may look a little old, I don't mind as it is still absolutely gorgeous, the car textures are amazing, the sound is next level.... the game is so immersive! it's great! There is a career mode and online mode, something F1 2015 (also why I dont have F1 2015, other than I can't really pay for it either) is kinda lacking, and it's just such a great game and sim! It's even got manual launch control! I've never really seen that in much of any other games. I currently have no money on my hands as my parents are going through hard times until we can sell our house later this year (hopefully). Once that happens though, I'll be getting some allowance (I haven't gotten any for the past year or so due to constraints), and my co op job will also get me some income; if not, i'll get a part time job. I'll then give back to the community, and until then which I can get a proper wheel, I'll be using a PS3 controller I got for 5 bucks. Conclusion Thanks for doing the giveaway, and congrats (??) on 2nd anniversary of your account!"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,dons90,2,Sat Jul 18 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"Steam ID!  Amazon Wishlist!  Also, what I'm asking for isn't a game, but rather, a PC accessory from Amazon. If it's possible, I'd REALLY love a Xbox 360 Controller Wireless Receiver for PC. If you don't know what it is, it's basically a small receiver you can connect via USB that allows you to wirelessly use up to 4 Xbox 360 controllers on a game. It's only $20, and I actually did have one, but I recently had to throw it out because it slowly stopped working over time until it didn't function at all (I think the wire on the inside shorted out somehow). I used it VERY frequently, and it was my go-to tool when I wanted to play TowerFall, Nidhogg, Lethal League, or some other local multiplayer title at a friend's house, or when I just wanted to play a game with a standard controller. Now that I don't have one anymore, I don't have a reliable method to play games with friends on my PC. I have two Xbox One controllers I can use, but they aren't mine (meaning I can't take it to a friend's house), and I have to use them using some super short Micro USB cables that I have. It's a really nice accessory to have around, and it always worked perfectly (except for when it started malfunctioning) when I played with my friends. If you could get me a replacement receiver, I'd have all of the respect in the world for you. It's one of the most (for lack of a better word) important things I use on my PC, and it's really a bummer not having one.  For the bonus round:   For favorite Steam emote (judging by the ones you have on your profile), I'd probably guess :happy_creep: from the Monster Summer Sale. For least favorite game on Steam... I actually can't even guess on this one. There are so many bad games on Steam, I couldn't even pick one.   Thanks for reading this, and if you end up gifting it to me, I'll PM you my shipping information. :)"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Ragequitr2,2,Sat Jul 18 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this giveaway!  My name is Nate, I'm from Ohio, USA. I'm 18 and will be starting college this year. I will be studying computer science. My hobbies are drawing, playing the piano, making music on FlStudio, gaming, and almost any outdoor activities. I love doing risky shit for the adrenaline rush.  Steam ID  Amazon  I would like to win GTAV, but if you don't want to spend that much, Black Mesa is for sure equally as good to me. I want this game because it is one of the most fun games I have played and I don't get bored with it. I have watched full playthroughs and it has the best story out of the GTA games in my opinion. I own the other games and want to complete the series with this one.  Why can't I get it? Because $60 is too much for me to spend on a game, even if it was Half-Life 3. And that is saying a lot. I need to save my money for college though, biggest reason.  Your favourite steam emote is probably the default smiley face everyone has. Your favourite game is Dota 2. I hope those guesses are correct."
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Vorgex,2,Sat Jul 18 04:53:28 2015 UTC,"Hi, OP! Thanks a lot for doing this awesome giveaway.  I'm a 15 year old student that loves programming and gaming. However, my laptop can't run any modern game (or unity/unreal engine) so I'm spending my holiday working for my father and in the supermarket of my uncle and grandfather (Spar in Abbenbroek, the Netherlands) to earn money to buy an awesome desktop pc. I won't have any money left after buying the desktop, as I don't get paid a lot, and there's one game I have wanted sooo much since release. Elder scrolls online.   I'm a massive fan of the Action MMORPG genre. I was tricked into buying a PS4 with Destiny, thinking it would be exactly that, and I still play it regularily but it's not what I wanted :l. And yeah I could sell the PS4 for money but it won't ever give me back my original purchase price and the PS+. I have tried Dragon Nest Europe, Tera, Blade and Soul, Black Desert, PSO2, Neverwinter, Moonlight Blade (it doesn't have an english patch so I couldn't do much) and I love them all so far, but my laptop can't run any of them very well. When I have bought and built my new desktop I want to play the best Action MMORPG there is now in my opinion which is Elder scrolls online. I won't be able to afford it for a while after I buy my new desktop, but I'd love to start with it as my first game that I can play on high graphics 60fps.  What I love about this game:   Only a few skills instead of 30 skills like most other mmorpgs have very active playerbase gorgeous open-world graphics great pc version (sadly these days this is miraculous) realistic quests (or so I've heard, I didn't want to spoil too much)   I'm not very active on steam because I play most of my games outside of it in different launchers. I'm still planning on playing MoH, but I don't want to spoil the story on low graphics 20fps so I'm waiting for my new pc aswell. Anyways, I don't really know what the emoticons are on steam, so I can't really guess.  Least favourite game guess: Sakura spirit?  Game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/  Steam id: http://steamcommunity.com/id/amirzaidi1999"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Ragequitr2,2,Sat Jul 18 08:18:11 2015 UTC,http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrObInStInE/  I don't have an amazon wish list. But I do like gun skins.  If I could have anything. I wish for the dlc for Destiny on my Xbox One. That and a beautiful lady to mistreat me.
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Vorgex,2,Sat Jul 18 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"I've been trying for this game for a while now, but I'll keep on trying despite my previous failures nothing can stop me!!  I am THE /u/LegendForHire. The way I got my username is from one of my favorite bands, Icon For Hire ( you should totally check them out).  I liked the way the sort of boldly proclaimed they were an icon of the times  with their name so I boldly proclaimed myself a legend with mine. what else  should you know about me. Hmmmm, I LOVE anime. I'm still just in the shallow end of anime( compared to others that is), but This is a list of what I'd currently recommend out of what i'd watch. I'm also currently watching Durarara, Charlotte, Darker than Black, Monster, and Gintama. you can find my anime recommendation list here. From, this season I'd recommend Charlotte. It's shaping up to be an awesome anime. I also love music as is known by my title. some of my favorite bands are Icon for Hire, Skillet, Amaranthe, Dir En Grey, Panic at the Disco, and Fall Out Boy. I enjoy all genres of music, but some more than others. Despite my favorite bands, the best concert I've ever been to is a concert by Lecrae. That was the most adrenaline pumping thing I've ever seen. Obviously since I'm here I also love video games. I'll play most genres, but i like some in general more than others. An awesome game I played recently was Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. Another good one I played was Vanquish. while the story was lacking in that game, the game mechanics were awesome. One of the most underrated games of the PS3 generation, and the only one I've seen nail the sliding mechanic. It was amazing. You should totally check it out. this is my Steam ID.   The game I want is Don't Starve Mega Pack. It's a game that I've been dying to have for a while now. It really looks like an awesome game, and it's really my style of game. Let me get down to the reasons I want it.   1) It's a survival game. I don't fully understand my attachment to survival games, but I do love them I've always loved them and probably always will. I find myself putting 10x the hours into survival style games than any other game, and the more realistic it is the better, and by realistic I don't mean graphics wise. What i mean is, does it focus on everything you need to actually survive?, and does it balance all the survival necessities like real life. Everywhere I go I see rave reviews of don't starve. Among those I often see ti is one of the best and most realistic survival games. I really look forward to trying it out if I win.  2) I love figuring things out. It's part of the reason I'm a really tech savvy guy now. By the time I was 4 I could already run anything I wanted on a computer because i figured out how to install programs and navigate the computer well. I was better at anything related to computers than my parents by the time I was 5. Then as I grew older I started building my own computers from spare parts I could get. Now, any problem that occurs with my computer I can fix or find out how to fix myself. I haven't called tech support in 6 years. Figuring stuff out has really empowered me growing up,so that;s why I love figuring stuff out. How is this related to Don't Starve? well don't starve has no tutorial. you start with nothing to help you. You have to figure it all out on your own. That's a better puzzle than any puzzle game I've played, and this is a survival game. The best puzzle is figuring out how to survive in a cruel world.  3) It's a challenge. Games that aren't challenging aren't anywhere near as enjoyable. I can enjoy them as much as a challenging game very rarely when they have a good story. A good example of this would be To The Moon( Which I'd so recommend to you all) , but that game was built for story purposes, so it had to have an absolutely spectacular story. This game though is a challenge. I've seen people sob at the challenge because they can't make it past day 3. I see people in shock when people last a month. That frickin EXCITES me. That is amazing. That is a challenge i yearn for. It can quench my hunger for something to struggle against for at least a little while, and it's been a good while since I've found a game truly challenging.  4) This applies mostly to Don't Starve Together, but it needs to be included. I Love co-op games.I love working together with someone to figure things out and I love spending time with people. I am almost addicted to spending time with people. If i don't have contact with people for even a short time I literally get depressed. I'd really love this as an avenue of something to do with people, meet new people, and hang out with old friends.  5) Don't Starve Together is Early Access. It's not a full product. I can help it become a product. I can be part of the development, and that would be so cool. I often see people complain about games being released in a broken state and I also see people saying it's because people buy the early access game and don't give developers feedback. I'd love to be part of the solution. I'd love to be part of the reason that games get released in completed states. And, I'd love to make sure Don't Starve Together is one of the games that is completed on release.  Finally, This is my Amazon Wishlist  Edit: I'm guessing Fez is your least favorite game you've played. and I'm guessing your favorite emote is either :VenexianaStevenson: or :blissful_creep:"
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Vorgex,2,Sun Jul 19 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"Steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20  Amazon Wishlist: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2FBMNLNIKGEKM/ref=cm_wl_huc_view  Hi there, I go by the username dons20/dons90 and I love PC gaming (PCMR!). Ever since I got my laptop last year summer, I've been playing almost everything I can.   So anyway I've been a big fan of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. I spent a lot of time playing San Andreas, as it was one of the best open world games of its time (that my PC of the time could handle). Needless to say, with the release of GTA V I've been fanboying it ever since. However as a student I haven't been able to afford it myself, it's a rather big investment at one time. It is my hope that I will be a winner in this giveaway and I can get GTA V ^_^.   Also this is a really awesome thing you're doing for the community. Respect."
GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Ragequitr2,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"I am ragequitr2. I absolutely love games and the culture surrounding it, even though many people who don't game don't understand it. But to be fair, I don't understand their footballs and whatnot. Even though I love games, I only really play the games I truly can enjoy for hours on end. Games like The Last of Us, etc. are great, but I don't want to spend 60$ on a game I can only enjoy once. A great example of a game that appeals to me, personally, is GTA V.. I would like you to know that I already own this game on PS3. I have tried to request this game many times on this sub, but that doesn’t matter. I will keep trying, and even if I don’t win, I get to express my joy of talking about video games. I’ve entered two of your previous giveaways, and maybe you might even recognize me, but those entries were failures, so hopefully this one won’t be.   There are a plethora of reasons why I want this game, so I will try to list as many as I can. To be honest with you, no amount of words can express my love for this game. But you can sure as hell bet that I will try as hard as I can to write out all those words.    My emotional ties to this game make me love it a lot   I got this game on my birthday when it was still brand new. We were struggling financially back then, so I didn’t expect much more than a trip to my favorite restaurant. I got what I expected, but I also got what I didn’t expect; a brand new TV along with GTA V. It was one of the best birthdays because I didn’t expect so much. This game also helped me get past some dark times (don’t worry, I didn’t try suicide, nor did I think of it. But it was a dark time nonetheless). I don’t wish to elaborate on the situation, but that’s not the important part. The thing is, the game helped me escape into a different world until the situation blew over. That’s why it will forever stick in my mind as my favorite game. It was an amazing game within itself, but to me, it is so much more than just an open world game. GTA V also helped me get into the world of gaming. Back then, I wasn’t much of a gamer, although I knew CoD, etc. Today, I know all the insides and outs of modern gaming and news. Without GTA V, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. I’m sure everyone here has a game that they love, not just because it’s a good game, but because they’re tied to it emotionally. For me, that game was GTA V. This is one reason why I want the game on PC. I want to play the game I love, however, on a machine that can truly harness the complete capabilities of GTA V.    I have already invested a lot of time into this game, and it was all worth it   With all the hours combined, I have spent close to 900 hours on this game. Proof. I just want to point this out because I wanted you to believe and truly know that I love this game. This game has been my life for the past 2 years. Once I’m done with all my errands or all my classes, I usually head straight upstairs and boot up this game. Now, you may be wondering how I’ve spent so much time in the game without getting bored. To be completely honest with you, I did get bored from time to time. That’s why I keep CSGO as a substitute. But I always come back to the game like it is brand new whenever I’m refreshed. And not only that, but Rockstar always releases free DLC almost every month (sometimes they skip a month). In the DLC’s are new cars, clothes, guns, helicopters, and planes that I can play with. However, in order to afford these new toys, I have to complete missions in order to gain enough money to buy them. Once I afford all of the DLC items, that’s when I get bored, and fallback to CSGO. And once Rockstar releases another DLC, I’m attracted to GTA V once again, for another few weeks. So as you can see, this game never fails to catch my attention, and will continue to do so as long as Rockstar still supports it. Trust me, CSGO is great, but I can’t play it to the extent of how I play GTA V because Valve barely adds anything new to the game. This is another reason why I want GTA V on PC. It’ll be much more convenient to have all the games I play on one machine, plus, PC exclusive content.    I want to be able to play with my PC friends   I know a lot more people on PC than I know on PS3. Public sessions are fun, but having friends in there makes it 10x better. You can talk about your day while driving around San Andreas,complete missions with your buddy, Or maybe even kill other players together. The point is, having friends with you makes the GTA experience so much better. Lately, I’ve had to play by myself since most of my PS3 friends have moved on to current gen or PC. I would love to be able to get back together with them.    Roleplay   This isn’t very common to most players, but I like to roleplay a lot in GTA V. It’s surprisingly fun to play as cop or a civilian in the game, since you usually have to play the criminal all the time. Our roleplay community has reached around 300 players at one point, and we intend on growing much more. However, most of our players are either on Ps4 and PC, so roleplaying sessions on PS3 have gotten smaller and spread apart. However, GTA V on PC has many things that are ideal for roleplaying. For example, first person and 30 players. First person will make it more immersive, and the new 30 player limit (an improvement over 16) will make roleplaying even better due to the amount of players you can interact with. Here is a link if you want to pay us a visit.    Improvements over old gen (PS3/XB360)   There are quite a lot of things that have changed in the new versions of GTA V. I haven’t been able to experience them yet, but here is a brief list of things that are new or changed:    Next gen exclusive DLC cars and weapons (which are all free) such as the Duke O' death armored car, the air/land/sea Dodo bird airplane, and the rail gun. First person. You can enter first person on the next gen versions, which you can't do on PS3/ XB360. Side note- I liked to roleplay in GTA V, so this can really make things more realistic which is important in RP. 30 player online lobbies. I'm mostly excited for this because of my association with Roleplay and stuff. 16 players really wasn't enough for us since our factions were too spread out on the map. 30 players is definitely enough. A brand new addition to the GTA: V story mode following one of the main characters, Micheal. Not only that, I'm also excited for hardware related upgrades like: 60 FPS 1080P Game mods. Game mods can really make the game even better. This is confirmed with games like Skyrim and Fallout. I've seen a few mods for this game- and let me tell you, it really makes me want this game even more. Better textures and graphics. They were already mid blowing on PS3. I can only imagine what it will look like for me on my PC. It would be amazing to be able to experience all these things for myself instead of having to watch videos or friends experience it themselves. I’m sure that with all this stuff, I can re- experience GTA V like never before. In truth, it will probably make me love the game all over again. Why can’t I get it for myself?   I don’t want to lie to you, so I will tell you the truth. I can buy this game right now with the 70$ I have in my wallet. However, there are a few more things that take priority. I need to pay for textbooks soon, rent is coming up, gas is getting very expensive where I live, and I’m on a minimum wage salary. If I were to go out and buy whatever I want, I would be in very big financial trouble. So hopefully you can understand that I just can’t put GTA V on my priority list right now. And since I need to get this off my chest; I already lost like 20$ in CSGO betting, so I kind of have to regain that back in a way.   Due to the word max, the rest of it will be a reply to this comment  Edit: Formatting"

GiftofGames,3dkdsq,Sgtsnicker,2,Fri Jul 17 09:44:55 2015 UTC,"Why this game interests me so much?     I’ve already told you why I love this game. But why exactly does this game stick out so much from the others? Well, this is because it’s so one of a kind. It’s not like Saints Row, in which it’s not too goofy, but it’s not too serious either. Grand Theft Auto V is one of the few well developed open world games out there, and that is why it interests it. What other game lets you do whatever the heck you want? Only a handful of them exist out there. Plus, there is also a huge map you can play with, which provides an unlimited amount of things you can do. So basically, that’s why it gained my interest in the first place, and why it continues to hold my interest to this day. It’s not really about what they have given you to play with, its more about the freedom and what you do with it.  Well, that’s pretty much it for me. Before I forget, here’s my Steam ID. Look, It doesn’t matter if I win or not. Like I said, I am very passionate about this game, and gaming in general. So, if writing about this game can give me a chance to actually get it, then by all means, I am grateful for the opportunity. But even if I don’t win, I got to express my love for this game, and people were able to read it.   Just in case you wanted to read my previous requests: https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3arl1u/offer_steam_witcher_3_fallout_4_gta_5_batman/csfoueh https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3b0rzm/offer_steam_the_top_game_on_your_wishlist/cshzdlh https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/31g0rc/offer_once_again_grand_theft_auto_v/cq1evyd https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/2zqu7j/offersteamdigitalwww_weekend_giveaway_any_game/cplnliy  For my guess on your least favorite game: Is it Super Crate Box? You said you didn’t like it in your review, but I’m 98% sure you were being sarcastic. Either way, it was worth a shot.   And last but not least, my friends and I say hello  Good luck to everyone, and have a good day!   EDIT 2: Holy shit, congratulations on your second CSGO jackpot win, dude. Don't keep testing your luck, though, that's how you loose it all :P But damn, I can never get that lucky lol. Two CSGO jackpots wins... I can't believe it."

Stanley IceBlack88 was a teacher in a place called Mexico, where he was teacher number 427. His job was simple, he sat at his desk and classroom 427 and pushed his students to the limit. Orders came through a chalk board at the teacher's room telling him what facts he should push, how hard he should push them and in what order. This is what teacher 427 did every day, of every month of every year. And although he had a 9 month old daughter some might considered soul-rending, Stanley IceBlack88 relished every moment the crying came, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley IceBlack88 was happy.  And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley IceBlack88. Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single giveaway had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No-one had showed up to give him any game, ask for a key of his, or even say Hi. Never in all his minutes at /r/GiftofGames had this happened - this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley IceBlack88 found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his silence.""   All of your giveaways were gone. What could it mean? Badass guy! charredgrass decided to go to his profile. Perhaps he had simply missed a response.  But then, after finally recovering to his senses, Badass guy! Charredgrass finally realized the big truth. If he had to go out to the open world, he would surely have to make decisions and take responsibilities, and one wrong decision could lead to very unfortunate results. On the other hand, giving games away to other users was also not a preferable choice for Badass guy! Charredgrass. Of course, I was here for him, ready to accept The Stanley Parable from him. But Badass guy! Charredgrass couldn't have known that. Therefore, he remained in the same spot for hou-"

I'd like to enter for the game, and I'd like to get ARK: Survival Evolved. I've heard great things and I know the characters look flat out stupid, so that'd make for big laughs. I'm hearing good things about customization too, which as the game grows, I'm looking forward to seeing how detailed and crazy it might get.    I can't get it myself though because I'm saving every penny I have to take my brother to Texas in a few weeks for RTX. He's turning 15 this year and I decided for Christmas to surprise him with the trip, but as we're coming down to the wire, I'm trying to make every dollar count with costs. It's giving me a monster headache because of travel issues, but it'll be a lot of fun and I treasure spending time with my brother, who lives a state away and I don't get to see him that much.    God, I sound like a sob story. Really I'd just be interested in the game to make him laugh and make others laugh, and maybe you'd be kind enough to help me out in the meantime until I can gift in return.

I have watched a few gameplays and have personally played it myself before on my friend's Xbox One. I have to say, it's one of the best games I've ever played. I love the online mode.

You don't get a lot of time to argue your case, and wild accusations fly around like crazy.

My most frustrating part of 1 was probably that room you have to go through this tunnel type thing into this other room with 3 turrets and an energy ball that you have to portal into the 3 of them. Just tedious. In portal 2, the most frustrating parts was figuring out that you have to portal jump yourself through the logo in that one part, or figure out that the tiny white square 1000000000 miles away is what you need to portal.  2) I'm trying to focus my education on computer programming, because I just love coding of pretty much all kinds!

GiftofGames,3diyzl,bdonvr,2,Fri Jul 17 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"You win! Honestly, I'd gift both entrants but since i have only one copy, Random.org picked a number you were designated. :)  I'll add you on Steam soon! Name's Sharpened"

GiftofGames,3dh88s,MaximumDan,3,Thu Jul 16 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"That's... A good idea! There's not really any games I want but I'm probably going to get my old laptop repaired, since it has like 6GB RAM and my current one has 2GB."
GiftofGames,3dh88s,MaximumDan,5,Thu Jul 16 15:11:38 2015 UTC,Happy to be of assistance :)    Sometimes you can get carried away with that 'rush' you get from doing a good deed and making someone else happy that you forget to spend a little on yourself.  Your own happiness is also important!  And good gaming gear is a little slice of happiness :)
GiftofGames,3dh88s,Sinfusion,3,Thu Jul 16 15:17:19 2015 UTC,Wise words from a wise man.
GiftofGames,3dh88s,SOMMARTIDER,7,Thu Jul 16 19:20:07 2015 UTC,I prefer giveaways where multiple people win. Possibly a $20 limit per person?  (Totally has nothing to do with the fact that Rocket League is $20 and I want a chance at that game so bad.. :D)
GiftofGames,3dh88s,KindaConfusedIGuess,3,Thu Jul 16 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"I personally liked the idea you once proposed about giving away a 3DS, haha.   But uh, let's see... Why not give away multiple copies of some multiplayer game that YOU really like, to get other people to play with you?"
GiftofGames,3dh88s,FusRoeDah,3,Thu Jul 16 08:20:06 2015 UTC,"I like the ""any game <60$""-idea, gives more people the possibility to choose their dream game."

GiftofGames,3dh88s,SunshineZz,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"Big giveaways, hm. I'm in favor of nontraditional options - I saw your humble bundle thread earlier today, and I thought about how novel it was that you could give people tools to make games. That's a pretty literal Gift of Games. Made me think about the value of giving things that have a secondary kind of application, things like hardware or dev software, I think the idea of giving gifts like that is the most bang for your buck. You could spend your money on a $60 AAA giveaway, but there are so many of those, it'd also be cool to give a unique kind of option too.  Just my 2¢. Like many in this thread, my ideas are colored by the things on which I would presently spend my hypothetical steam cash. :)"
GiftofGames,3dh88s,acustic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:55:21 2015 UTC,I think to give people more options do a any game <$60

GiftofGames,3dh88s,Wolvson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:40:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe a steam wallet code is a good idea because it could break down into other smaller giveaways. Let's say you're aiming for a 40$ title, a decent guy would pay the rest forward in his own giveaway. And as a typical effort-question you could ask what game(s) you'll get and what draws you to it."
GiftofGames,3dh88s,SalgacMC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:49:11 2015 UTC,"Well, why not, instead of ""one game for x amount"", find a big multiplayer game or something (or lots of little inexpensive games)? :D"
GiftofGames,3dh88s,PierreTrudeau_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:01:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd like Grim Fandango Remastered, but I think ""Any game < $60"" is the best idea. That way the winner will be able to choose what he wants."

GiftofGames,3dh88s,EdenSB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to offer my two cents here, but I think it would be fun for everyone involved if you made it like a sorta competition. Most people here have some technical skills like Photoshop or can program, maybe do a competition related to one of those? You could choose multiple winners, and have different prizes for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd."
GiftofGames,3dh88s,ColdVergil,3,Thu Jul 16 14:45:58 2015 UTC,I think most people here have 'crappy paint skills' more than Photoshop/Programming...
GiftofGames,3dh88s,Sinfusion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"I like the 'any game' option, since that includes Steam, other DRM, consoles, etc.  Deadpool just recently came back on the Steam store, though I'm not sure how popular it is.

I will also message you if you add me and I don't forget. No Effort? What a shame. You know, I see lots of no effort posts and it is a bit sad. No one ever specifies what ""no effort"" is. You see, effort is all based on opinion. For some, effort classifies as 1 secondary school paragraph. /u/Ali-Sama seems to think it is a formal oxford essay.  Oh, and /u/Agressiveonion, your homework is due on Monday. Now, back to the topic. Unless you can specify what no effort is, then I am forced to make a useless paragraph like this. I want the game because I have chores in real life I have to do, but sadly I can't pee on people or taser people on the way there. Also I need something to do while my beloved grandfather is in the hospital.  I'm not even going to try to convince you. This may be my downfall, but I HAVE RIGHTS TOO! :) I have a hobby in playing video games I play the viola and really like electronics! Sadly a lot of my favorites could be illegal like making EMP generators or anti-camera devices.. :("

Mainly because I'm really trying hard to save my money because I'm going to be going to college soon. That and I have a lot of steam games that I have not yet fully played through.  I am on a quest to 100% all the games in my steam library and a lot of them are fast paced Fps, action, adventure type games. I'm trying to change up the type of games I play so I don't get bored of any genre. Bejeweled is a nice casual game which I have always enjoyed and it also has steam achievements, a big factor in the games I like to have.  Thank you very much for this giveaway, that's a lot of stuff you are freely willing to gift.  Steam  Edit: knew I missed one, should've went back to check. Well, my name is Nate and I think I'm bad at introductions, so this may seem weak, idk what your looking for. I currently invest a lot of my time in games, but the other main hobby of mine is music.

GiftofGames,3dfz1y,Renal_Toothpaste,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like sometimes people just enter any giveaway because they might get a free game, not cause they want it. It's saddening too because there are others who seriously want the game and their chance gets lower and lower to win. If Bejeweled wasn't in this, I wouldn't have entered. I don't know of the other games."

GiftofGames,3dekqk,Kovaelin,3,Wed Jul 15 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"I find the Prime sale site to be a little disorganized. I've also been waiting on a price drop for the Surface Pro 3 for school in September. I think there's still time, but it's kind of bunk that the Canadian dollar is so weak.  Have you seen anything as a good alternative to the Surface Pro 3? People on the Windows Central forum seem to think a Surface Pro 4 is coming out soon, and with a huge price tag to make the 3 look more appealing. I need something super portable and powerful enough for programming. I'm hoping there will be some good ""back-to-school"" deals after Windows 10 comes out."
GiftofGames,3dekqk,tdogg8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"""Powerful enough for programming"" depends entirely on what you're programming. I've worked on a 2d game on a shitty celeron netbook with 2g of ram."
GiftofGames,3dekqk,icanhasreclaims,2,Wed Jul 15 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've scanned through the deals as they become live and the upcoming deals, and I'm not too impressed.  The only real deal I've seen for gaming was the Sandisk SSDs.  Everything else has been little gadgets like portable speakers and usb hubs.  I was hoping to do a small gift card giveaway, but I think I will just use it for a game giveaway."
GiftofGames,3dekqk,tdogg8,2,Wed Jul 15 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"Both the blue snowball and the blue yeti mics, audio technica m40x headphones were on sale. I picked up the snowball and headphones because my current headset died and a buddy of mine picked up a mobo (not sure which one)."
GiftofGames,3dekqk,icanhasreclaims,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't catch that one.  I've read a lot of good reviews for the snowball.  It seems most everyone is happy with it.  I should think about getting one as my ultimate set up is something like that mixed with something like these.  I currently have a turtle beach headset, but I have never been a fan of headsets.  The mic always messes with my peripheral vision."
GiftofGames,3dekqk,tdogg8,2,Wed Jul 15 22:04:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I've read a lot of good things about the snowball. And my buddy who's an audiophile suggested the headphones so overall I'm pretty excited for Friday. The best part was I had picked out those two things before the sales and decided to wait on the off chance that one would go on sale. I got lucky and both went on sale.
GiftofGames,3dekqk,icanhasreclaims,2,Wed Jul 15 22:26:36 2015 UTC,Nice.  Sometimes it definitely pays to wait.  Glad that worked out for you.

GiftofGames,3de7nt,ShadowSlayerII,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"I picked this game up two days ago and have been playing a bunch. Thoughts so far:  Gameplay: A ton of fun. I have seriously been having massive amounts of fun with this game... one of the more fun games.   The game is accessible with a high skill ceiling. The perfect mix for any competitive game.   The only thing I can see might be an issue is that it just gets repetitive after a little. I want a little more variation in the maps.   Also, the ranked play doesn't seem to have much rhyme or reason. Ranked just doesn't feel 'different' than non-ranked for some reason. It is still in 'pre-season' as they call it so this may change.  The player base is huge though. PS4 users get the game for free. Cross-platform isn't working perfect yet but the devs seem to be on top of it.   I can't say it isn't worth buying though. I feel I have got my money out of it already, so even if I did get bored eventually it wouldnt matter much."

The odds of potentially winning something can be quite the rush, and you don't always need money to gamble - just a resource (in this case, time).  Before I frequented GoG, I spent a lot of time in /r/randomactsofgaming. I won my first giveaway for The Swapper, and that was the catalyst for getting me into steam gifting, giveaways, and indie games. I rarely entered RNG giveaways, preferring ones where you had to answer questions in some detail. I had a very good hit rate - I'd say at least 75% of the giveaways I entered would result in me being the winner. This was a dangerous situation - I have always been a gambler and sensation-seeker my entire life. I used to go to the casino and play poker at friends' houses frequently. With the giveaways, it felt more like poker because I was playing at an advantage - I knew I was good at writing.  Once I started doing steam reviews, it really helped curb my giveaway entering. By the time I shifted over to GoG, I had shed my impulse to enter giveaways so rapidly and frequently.  Honestly, going cold turkey might be best for you. It also might make things worse. I find that slowly restricting yourself can be just as effective, but it always depend on the person."

GiftofGames,3d9m9y,Vermax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"I also loved Morrowind's gameplay. One had to actually use the journal and talk to people to get directions in order to progress with quests as there was no quest marker doing all the exploration for you, and as such I not only felt more immersed in the world but also I felt a greater sense of accomplishment in finishing quests. Morrowind also had the best spell and enchant system out of the latter three games, with spellcrafting providing a near infinite amount of creatable spells and being able to put just about every effect imaginable on an enchanted item so long as one had the skills necessary. The stats system in combination with the unleveled world also gave a sense of accomplishment; the enemies were as strong as they would always be, whilst your character would only get stronger and thus feel like he/she has actually progressed in the world as they progress with the quests and exploration within it. I even liked the clunky tabletop melee combat because, once again, it was tied into one's stats as well as one's stamina; when you reached that 60-70 skill rating and pretty much stopped missing hits on those random kagoutis, guar and f'ing cliff racers, you knew you had managed to grow in the game. Also, the opinion of the natives of you starts out small, but through joining their factions, doing quests for them, maybe a little bribery or persuasion or two, and finally through saving the world by the end everybody loves you. From zero to hero, from prisoner to the savior of Morrowind and perhaps the world from enslavement and Ur's false metaphysical preachings (as well as his attempt of recreating Big Stompy *shudders*), you know your character has grown throughout the game and can feel it too in both the combat and dialogue. This game was a 10/10 easy.  Oblivion was a fun game on console, but a real disappointment compared to Morrowind for me. No jungle Romans? Blasphemy. Nibenay was supposed to be the home of a thousand cults, yet all I see are temples to the nine everywhere in what should be a very cosmopolitan and religiously diverse Empire. Skyrim, however, more than made up for Oblivion to me. I had a blast on both console and PC, and I loved all the new lore that was added to the Nords and Falmer, especially stuff that was briefly mentioned in previous games or OOG texts that was confirmed (Giants and painted cows, Alduin and Dragons as shards of the greater Time Dragon AKA, Tsun and Sovngarde, the Dragon Cult pretty much being the Atmoran totemist animist religion (why do you think that each Nord tomb had those same symbols of the dragon, fox, snake, whale, hawk etc. that just happened to match up with Alduin, Ysmir, Shor, Tsun, Kyne etc.), the Falmer still existing but having been poisoned and enslaved by the Dwemer, and of course the return to Solstheim and all the lore surrounding the post-Red Year Dunmer who had suffered so much since the glory days of Morrowind. That's not even getting into the game having decent melee combat and stealth combat for once, as well as the neatness of the thu'um in general and the game's INSANE modability. If there is one game that justified my switch to PC, it's this one, no questions about it; modded Skyrim with Requiem, Frostfall, Morrowloot, Wet and Cold, iNeed, better book covers and libraries... I really should stop giving you all my mod list, but needless to say that Skyrim allows you to tailor that game to be the exact RPG you want it to be using mods in the Elder Scrolls Universe. I was able to mod my game to be more difficult than Morrowind and have Morrowind-esque loot system, I was able to mod my game to include more lore books, I was able to mod my game to unscale enemies and force me to eat, sleep, drink and maintain my character's internal body pressure as well as to skip the repetitiveness of Helgen. The one thing I really don't like about Skyrim is the magic system, the lack of flying whales that expel cocaine, the lack of wasabi (Nord's love it and line their shields with it so they can both taste and feel the heat of battle) and the absence of the true Nordic Pantheon and its replacement with the boring Alessian compromise; luckily, the magic system can be fixed with mods and the lore stuff is still present in previous game and OOG lore. Overall Skyrim, like Morrowind, was and is legendary, and those two games are some of my favorites of all time.  Like with any product I have interest in, I have done my research on Elder Scrolls Online. I have read in-game books through the Imperial Library, talked to people who have owned the game, watched PVP videos from Deltia's Gaming and SypherPK, and done my fair share of lurking on /r/ElderScrollsOnline to learn about the general state of the game from mechanics to lore and more. What I've seen impresses me to say the least, and for ease of reading I have decided to divide what I like about the game into categorical paragraphs below.     GAMEPLAY ESO gameplay, a combination of improved Skyrim mechanics and your typical MMO ability bar, really intrigues me and seems like a good way to bring the series to the MMO format. Melee combat in ESO seems like an improved version of Skyrim's: one has their standard heavy and light attack, as well as the capability to block. However, ESO introduces a new melee ability: dodge. Simply by double-tapping wasd in the direction of one's choice, one's character will perform a dodge-roll. Although this might seem not much, the dodge-roll is incredibly important in-game PVP, which is one of my biggest draws to the MMO genre: dodge-rolling breaks certain enemy abilities including cc's and thus is critical to just about every build. Because it takes a lot of stamina, dodge-rolling adds to the importance of a stat that in Skyrim was basically nothing but a ""lol look at how many times I can power attack"" bar, whilst now it also is a key to defence (blocking also takes away stamina, and it to is crucial for survivability.) The net result? The increase in importance of the least important of the attribute bars in Skyrim--specifically it's magnitude and regeneration--and thus an increase in the overall depth of melee combat."

I have 72 games in my library that are shared with me, and without the kindness of my friends I would not have been able to experience awesome games on my PC like the original Crysis and the Portal series as well as allowing me to re-experience games that I lost from my childhood, like RTW Gold and Morrowind GOTY! So in summary, yes it's awesome."
GiftofGames,3d8x4o,Vermax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:59 2015 UTC,I tried to set it up but I just can't figure out how. I would love to share my library as I think I have quite a lot of cool games and would love to play some games I have on my wishlist.
GiftofGames,3d8x4o,zbyshekh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"For me it worked like this:  -activate ""steam guard"" on both accounts - log into account 1 on pc 1 - log into account 2 on pc 1 - log back into account 1 on pc 1. now you can allow account 2 to access your library on this pc in the settings.  tl;dr: let your friend log into his account on your pc, then go to settings and allow the pc owner to access your library."

Also    who the fuck spends 14.8 hours in huniepop   People who enjoy great plot that's who.
GiftofGames,3d7xkd,mangafreak,2,Tue Jul 14 05:37:38 2015 UTC,Wish I had the organisation skills to keep spreadsheet like that. I'd probably end up falling behind or forgetting to update it then giving up
GiftofGames,3d7xkd,AakashMasani,2,Tue Jul 14 06:19:44 2015 UTC,"Hai Charred!   More intro questions, since you didn't tell much yet!   You mentioned you like Sci-Fi in a steam convo quite a while back. What made you like Sci-Fi? What was your first touch into Sci-Fi? (Assuming the first two are different.) What Sci-Fi content are you enjoying currently? About D&D, how did you get into the scene? I've played RPGs like that a couple of times and enjoyed them quite a bit. Do you like other animation movies  besides Frozen? If so, which ones?   THANKS FOR AMA /s  (Also, wooo I'm in the lead in gaming hours. Unemployement/part-time emplyement works wonders.)"

GiftofGames,3d7xkd,EdenSB,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"I am somewhat interested in the game, but it is mainly due to a combination of the developers being PlatinumGames and having enjoyed watching the first Avatar series. Would you recommend it to someone who enjoys action games but have no watched Korra before?"
GiftofGames,3d7xkd,TheAzureDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:22 2015 UTC,"Not really. It was really good for me because I felt like it was an addition to the series and the art style and everything was consistent with the show. I don't recommend playing it without watching Korra. (Which you should watch, anyway because it's a good show!)"
GiftofGames,3d7xkd,sethegg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:29:03 2015 UTC,I lost interest in it ever since being told by a friend that the show had a steampunk setting.

Especially since we find out what happened to all the characters of ATLA after the series, and it builds on them. Including the Cabbage Salesman!"
GiftofGames,3d7xkd,AgentGPR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:56:30 2015 UTC,A very belated welcome!  Your list is much more organized and helpful than mine. I just tend to check up on some of the people after some time has passed (just did and found someone hasn't redeemed actually). I'm wishing I did the same now.   Not just because of the fact that it allows for comments such as;   who the fuck spends 14.8 hours in huniepop   (The answer may be the people who downloaded this).  What do you like about Frozen so much?
GiftofGames,3d7xkd,____Throw_Away___,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:53:12 2015 UTC,As someone with almost 13 hours in huniepop and still not really finished with it.... I'm hurt... I think.. I don't know what to feel anymore ;-;

And fuck yea Stranded Deep is dope as fuck but I stopped playing it much. The experimental build was fun for a while but even then, I need more updates. I was just surprised how optimized it was because my laptop isn't really the greatest but I still got some really solid fps while playing."
GiftofGames,3d7dim,DjSoulFuck,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:52 2015 UTC,"Ha! My roommates heckle me while I play it. ""What's the point? Why do you find this fun?"" Because it's like Tom Hanks in Castaway, sucka! It's a pretty small team working on it from what I understand, but yeah, you kind of run out of things to do with such small islands and where the building and crafting is at now. I'm excited to see where it goes. Bigger islands is a must, though."
GiftofGames,3d7dim,DjSoulFuck,2,Tue Jul 14 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, my last save I had a central island with most of my resources and since I had so many to the point where I was lagging, I ended up making a watchtower/lighthouse of sorts on all 4 sides of the island. It turned out really well but God damn I eventually just ended up exploiting the paddle bug to get to islands faster because travelling even with a motor is a pain."

GiftofGames,3d7l1i,mangafreak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:35:26 2015 UTC,"I'd probably do it through Steam, which means the victor would need the game in their account.   It feels a bit odd to me. If they already have the game in their account, then they would already have heard what is available in the soundtrack. Which kinda defeats the purpose of introducing people to some quality compositions."

I'm going to Uni in a year and for me to take a big gaming rig like my older brother did would be impractical, as he found out. This will be good for what I want to do, and I can always build a rig at Uni if I really want."

No more Iwata Asks, no more Nintendo Directs from him, no more ""please understand"", no more of a man who truly loved the games industry and drove Nintendo to higher heights. He was such a brilliant programmer too, jamming all that content into Gold and personally working on Melee so it could ship with the Gamecube release. I always looked up to him, and I loved him as the face of Nintendo, such a pleasant, relatable, personable fellow he was. Rest in peace. I hope the next world is as wonderful as all the worlds you've helped craft for us, Iwata."

GiftofGames,3d330v,FantasyHeaven,3,Mon Jul 13 04:09:34 2015 UTC,"It seems to be me that after the N64, Nintendo started a transistion from being a ""console manufacturer"" to a ""toy manufacturer"". Their decision to move away from hardware performance and focus on what I consider to be ""gimmicky"" hardware features has turned them into a niche company that caters mainly to young children and those that don't take gaming seriously.   They still make excellent handhelds though.  RIP"
GiftofGames,3d330v,TransPM,7,Mon Jul 13 03:49:23 2015 UTC,"The way I see it: they're not interested in technical superiority, they're not interested in current trends, they're interested and invested in fun. Now, please don't misunderstand (I'm sorry, I had to) this as some claim that Nintendo do is ""the best"" or ""better"" than any other company (though I'm certainly a fan), they just do things they're own way, and they seem just fine doing things that way. While not every one of their ideas pans out, and even the successful ones aren't made to everyone's tastes, they still come up with some incredible ideas that even ""real famers"" can get behind.  They're almost like the Pixar of gaming. Just happy to be there to give the world a nice warm place to play when they feel like being a kid again. Of course, you don't always feel like being a kid (well, not everyone anyway), but it's still nice to have that."
GiftofGames,3d330v,TransPM,3,Mon Jul 13 05:42:57 2015 UTC,I feel like this too. They do care about the gameplay and don't sell their souls for sales like other companies. At least with Iwata as CEO :( Hope the next one shares Nintendo's principles.
GiftofGames,3d330v,FantasyHeaven,2,Mon Jul 13 05:55:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'll be OK. They'll most likely promote from within to fill the role of CEO, and the culture within Nintendo seems to share the same general mindset. I don't think this loss will really change Nintendo as much as it will just hurt on a more personal level. Iwata was a truly incredible guy."
GiftofGames,3d330v,EdenSB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:08:16 2015 UTC,Yeah just saw and the next CEO seems to be Miyamoto XD I do love that everyone shares the same thoughts.
GiftofGames,3d330v,FantasyHeaven,2,Mon Jul 13 06:16:31 2015 UTC,"That's my view of Nintendo as well. However, I am of the view that the leaders of innovation should be developers and not hardware manufacturers. The fact that Nintendo is both means that whatever decisions that they make with regard to their consoles will also affect third-party developers - and third-party games are what makes up the majority of a console's library. The Wii and its successor Wii U doesn't have much (good) third-party games, and I feel that this weakness is a significant factor to many who cannot afford more than one console.  That is, Nintendo's decision has made it so that their profits are reliant mainly on the quality of their first-party (and I supposed also ""second-party"") games; pragmatism dictates that they will eventually put profits ahead of innovation. In fact, I suspect that the success of their handhelds is what is allowing them to take these financial risks with respect to their non-portable counterparts.  Let's not forget about what happened with Sega's Dreamcast. The console was ahead of its time, having a built-in 56K modem for online play. It also had an excellent library of games (Shenmue, Phantasy Star Online, Sonic Adventure, etc). And I can't help but feel that Nintendo will inevitably follow in Sega's footsteps if they continue on with what they're doing."
GiftofGames,3d330v,EdenSB,2,Mon Jul 13 08:58:38 2015 UTC,"Obligatory Shenmue 3 Kickstarter mention here.  The Dreamcast really was ahead of it's time. It was amazing back then, to be able to play Phantasy Star Online with people elsewhere in the country."
GiftofGames,3d330v,FantasyHeaven,2,Mon Jul 13 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"Despite the sales, the Shenmue series enjoyed positive reviews. The Shenmue 3 kickstarter reached its target within a day."
GiftofGames,3d330v,EdenSB,2,Mon Jul 13 09:21:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean 'despite the sales'. Shenmue was the 4th best selling game on the Dreamcast apparently. Shenmue 2, not so much admittedly.    The Shenmue 3 Kickstarter target was reached, but they did basically say that at 2 million, it'd be a very scaled down, story focused game. I'm hoping it hits 7 million for all of the improved battle stuff to be included, but it seems doubtful now."
GiftofGames,3d330v,grimvover9000,2,Mon Jul 13 09:24:19 2015 UTC,Shenmue had a huge development cost - the sales weren't enough to make a profit.
GiftofGames,3d330v,Ali-Sama,2,Mon Jul 13 09:29:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's definitely true. It sold really well it seems and was definitely well reviewed, but the cost of development is likely why we didn't see a Shenmue 3 despite all the requests."
GiftofGames,3d330v,EdenSB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:31:15 2015 UTC,"You put this into words perfectly.  Nintendo isn't really the company striving to be the next big thing, it's the company that will remain an ever present force in the living room, a part of the family, something that represents fun with your friends. Nintendo puts their full heart into every game they make, and for me, every one of their games that I play brings out that same sense of joy I had when I was little. I've moved on to more mature platforms and titles, but I'll be damned if I ever stop loving Nintendo and playing their games. If a new Pokemon comes out later this year, I'll be playing that on my 2DS when I'm not playing Fallout 4. When I want to have fun with friends, Smash Bros will always be my preference no matter how much I continue improving at CS:GO, or how good Battlefront 3 is later on.   Nintendo has this amazing way of creating a sense of nostalgia even with their new games that simultaneously fill you with childlike amazement in what is new. Eg: Pokemon X&Y, movement no longer being grid restricted, Pokemon ORAS, soaring through the skies on Mega Lati@s.   I hope that whoever takes charge as the next head of Nintendo will continue leading them in the same direction, and that Iwata can rest well."

GiftofGames,3d330v,Mr_Cutestory,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed, and I see it as evidence in support of my opinion. The Wii's success is due to it being highly appealing to ""non-gamers"" and they are a very large demographic. But they are also not a demographic that you can continuously tap into - unlike gamers, they don't care about the next-generation consoles and the future of gaming. It is unlikely for them to purchase a Wii U when their Wii is still functional (or if the Wii is still available for retail purchase)."

GiftofGames,3d330v,EmeraldJirachi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"I cried a bit. Nintendo has been there for so many of us from a young age. I was born in 1994, and I was lucky enough to have been able to play all the main Pokemon games as they came out. They really helped me make a lot of friends and gave me a lot of things to do. This was generally on the Gameboy Color/Advance/DS. Then came the Gamecube and the introduction to the games that really changed the way I not only viewed video games, but also life overall like Super Mario Sunshine, Time Splitters 2, Tales of Symphonia, Super Smash Brothers Melee and Mario Kart Double Dash. They were great games that have brought about countless memories. Cue college and adding the Wii U and Nintendo 2DS into my college years where I helped start a Smash Club.   None of that would have been possible if not for Iwata. I never got to meet him or ever speak to him. Truth be told, I doubt I was ever in the same state as him, but I wish I met him just to thank him for all the fantastic memories he provided me with."
GiftofGames,3d330v,unowndanger,2,Mon Jul 13 05:51:10 2015 UTC,"I wish I'd have owned those. I only owned a Nintendo 64 in which Ocarina of time, Goldeneye, Super Mario 64, SSB and others started my gamer life. Then I owned a Wii. I certainly can say that Nintendo is more about the gameplay and having fun. This is what makes them so different.   And now I read in all those other games Iwata was behind. For example giving advice to Sakurai in continuing with the SSB series was the best one. Damn I'm gonna miss him so much. It's gonna be hard on the next Nintendo Direct."

I've been using a pair of Samsung earphones I got with my phone with an inbuilt mic, and I'm having absolutely no problem with my audio, and my friends say that my Mic is pretty good too."
GiftofGames,3d2xqq,mikebrown_pelican,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have earphones with inbuilt microphone. And to be honest, I've used earphones at night and they begin to feel pretty annoying in the ear after extended periods. I highly prefer headphones. But, each to their own I guess.   Also, bought Motorolas phone a long time ago, no clue if there were any earphones to begin with, and if there were, the location is anyones guess.  Thanks for reading! :)"

GiftofGames,3czwwk,Justin131113,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:07:24 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with that at all, it's just different from what I'm interested in. Do you play RPGs that have significant amounts of combat in them, or do you prefer a very story focused game?"
GiftofGames,3czwwk,KevinSays-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:10:28 2015 UTC,"I can enjoy both, althought I tend to like story focused rpg's more. Love me some Dragon Age, Mass Effect or FF'S :D"
GiftofGames,3czwwk,KevinSays-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:09:01 2015 UTC,"How much combat do you consider to be too much for your taste? Would Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas be too much, for example? If not, I would recommend New Vegas if you don't already have it. It has quite a bit of combat, but with the right skills and perks you can solve a lot of problems with stealth and fast talking. Also with VATS the combat is significantly easier if you prefer it that way.  Mount & Blade Warband has quite a bit of a combat focus but can be significantly story focused as well (depending on your definition of the term) as it basically lets you shape the entire world of the game based on your actions. There's also a lot of mods for it, such as a Game of Thrones mod. Again though, significantly combat focused and probably not what you're looking for, but thought I may as well recommend it.  These are probably crap suggestions for what you're looking for, sorry if they're not helpful. Whatever you do buy, just make sure to do the proper research and be sure it's what you want. Not trying to be condescending, but I have a few games in my Steam library I should have never bought."

GiftofGames,3d02f4,Blazer1001,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. Mass Effect is an extremely story based game series. The first game has choices and actions that effect 2. If you don't play 1, some of the choices will be forced to be one way in 2, and you'll never see the other side of it. Also, 1's gameplay is arguably worse, so if you do what I did. You get used to the combat system in 2 and 3 and then play 1 and not enjoy it as much."

But then I realized that Higurashi wasn't all that great after actually reading the kinetic novel - it could be because of it being the first part of a series, but the lack of closure despite the relatively long content left me somewhat dissatisfied.  Also, the new art (while much better than the original) still seems a bit... off."

GiftofGames,3curoo,FusRoeDah,7,Sat Jul 11 02:42:19 2015 UTC,"you told me point blank you would ignore my entry, but forget you I do what I want!  [REQUEST][STEAM] Dying Light  Game Link and My Steam ID  My request.  Gib gaem pls Aak  Ha ha ha, but joking aside, lets get down to brass tacks (TIL it isn't ""Brass Tax""). I want Dying Light. It is hard to pin down a specific reason as to why I want it, so I shall choose 4, and talk about them.  1) Zombies: Let me tell you a story of father and son. It is the year Anno Domini 2010, and I am sitting at home, spending a rainy summer day watching TV. On pops ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and I think ""oh what the hell, lets watch us a horror-comedy.""  I was kind of freaked out. I had never watched a horror movie of any kind before, and Zombies gave me the creeps. But I, being a foolish brash young lad of 13, decided I could sack up and watch it alone. I figured it would be more comedy than horror, and even though it was, I still couldn't handle the horror bits. And so zombies return to their spot in my nightmares, never to leave again.  Or so I thought.  Thanksgiving, 2010. My cousin is talking to my dad, and they start talking about zombies. I am half-listening, b/c my Dad's stories are always worth listening to, but I couldn't listen to the full topic of zombies without getting the fear sweats. My cousin mentions a book about zombies, and offers it to my Dad (we were at my aunts house, my cousin lived there), and we take the book home.   My Dad is a speed reader. He could read a book a day if he was of a mind to. He read that book in a day. But we wouldn't see that cousin for several months, so the zombie book was lying there, taunting me and my early teenage fears. I nail my courage to the sticking place, and pick up this book. I finally get a look at the title: ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" by Max Brooks.  I begin reading. Dark enough start, the first sentence is ""The Dead walk among us,"" for God's sake. But soon enough I realize I don't want to put it down. It is gripping, fascinating, and at times humorous. I finish that book in about 3 days (I wasn't a speed reader yet), and look up if Max Brooks has any other books. He did. I check out his other work ""World War Z"" from the library the next time we go.  Holy hell. That book was insane. Genius. It was about zombies, the same way Catch-22 was about Germans. The Zombies were an ever-present reality, but the story was about the people, their experiences, the world gone to hell in a handbasket. I absorbed that book. THen went and bought a copy. It became one of my favorite books (I've read it once a year or so since then, so about 5-7 times), and made me love Zombie fiction.  Months pass, and Season 2 of the Walking Dead was about to begin. I had marathoned the first season (still the best, btw, though 5 is close) over the summer, and I was so ready to watch some real zombie apocalypse action. Since then, come Haloween time, my father and I will go down to the basement on Sunday nights at 8pm, and watch our weekly dose of Zombies. It is tradition, and even though we upgraded the main TV to HD, there is something pleasing about the ol' late 90s model we have down there, and we still watch episodes as they premiere down there.  As I'm a third of the way through my 10K character limit, I shall have to move on, but I think you see why anything with Zombies appeals to me on a very deep level.  2) Open world survival: The Dead Island series is a prime example of Great Idea, Poor Execution. Techland took a great starting premise ""Zombies on a tropical island paradise"" and put together a great gameplay system to go with it. But bugs, man. These games are really fun, but they lose a lot in the shoddy coding, reused textures, lame quests (yes, you'd have to do some fetch quests, but I feel like that was all I did), almost required multiplayer (some games could use this to their advantage, but sometimes I just want to traipse around Banoi alone, dig?) and a whole laundry list of other things. I enjoyed the Dead Islands, but they just weren't, I don't know, right for me.  But Dying Light takes notes off of Dead Island. It fixes its bugs, multiplayer isn't as necessary, zombies, while some are repetitive, have more flavor to them. It takes a great premise, great gameplay systems, and makes it into a truly great game. And the features it adds are truly impressive, which brings me to my next point:  3) FRICKIN' PARKOUR: That's right, not only did you survive the apocalypse, your frickin' EZIO AUDITORE. Who cares about the zombie horde when I can CLIMB A BUILDING WITH MY BARE HANDS?!?! And to see this in 1st person, while nauseating at first I'm sure, is truly awesome. Ok, enough screaming, back to the request  4) their self-aware of add campaigns. Recently, Bungie announced a Red-BullTM booster, and mission in the new expansion pack for Destiny. Available to those who purchased a Red Bull TM , any body could reap the rewards of product placement. To counter this, Dying Light and its devs put together a counter campaign centered around water. Simple, clean, free water. All you had to do was tweet a pic of yourself drinking water to their official twitter with their official hashtag, and you got bonuses to use in game. Proof that the dev is conscious of the issues of a modern gaming market, and is able to make light of the issue of product placement in games.  Those are my reasons for wanting Dying Light. Now have fun ignoring that Aak. :)"

I really would like the orange box bundle: http://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/  Here is my steam profile! http://steamcommunity.com/id/lol123456sdfsd/  I know, I know, it's technically a collection/bundle, but I'm seriously dying to play Half Life and Portal! I sold everything I didn't want in my steam inventory but I couldn't scrap enough to buy it :/   I currently own Episode 1 but I want to play the Half Life series in order (I already played through Half Life.. Amazing game). I'm not too sure of what else to say, Half Life is a series I really enjoy and I would give anything to play the rest of the series. It looks amazing and I've been killing myself making sure I don't run into any spoilers so when I do eventually end up getting the game it's not spoiled for me. (Which is really hard in this day and age!).. I mainly want to play it because... It's Half Life.. I want to continue the story from Half-Life 1.  If you want, you can only get Half Life 2, I won't be picky, although getting both HL2 and EP2 would be preferable."
GiftofGames,3curoo,CrazedGunman502,6,Sat Jul 11 00:17:19 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Don't Starve Mega pack  http://store.steampowered.com/sub/68776/  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Legend_For_Hire/  Hey aak,  Don't Starve (plus the multiplayer version) is a game that I've been dying to have for a while now. It really looks like an awesome game, and it's  really my style of game. Let me get down to the reasons I want it.  1) It's a survival game. I don't fully understand my attatchment to survival games, but I do love them I've always loved them and probably always will. I find myself putting 10x the hours into survival style games than any other game, and the more realistic it is the better, and by realistic I don't mean graphics wise. What i mean is,  does it focus on everything you need to actually survive?, and does it balance all the survival necessities like real life. Everywhere I go I see rave reviews of don't starve. Among those I often see ti is one of the best and most realistic survival games. I really look forward to trying it out if I win.  2) I love figuring things out. It's part of the reason I'm a really tech savvy guy now. By the time I was 4 I could already run anything I wanted on a computer because i figured out how to install programs and navigate the computer well. I was better at anything related to computers than my parents by the time I was 5. Then as I grew older I started building my own computers from spare parts I could get. Now, any problem that occurs with my computer I can fix or find out how to fix myself. I haven't called tech support in 6 years. Figuring stuff out has really empowered me growing up,so that;s why I love figuring stuuff out. How is this related to Don't Starve? well dont starve has no tutorial. you start with nothing to help you. You have to figure it all out on your own. That's a better puzzle than any puzzle game I've played, and this is a survival game. The best puzzle is figuring out how to survive in a cruel world.  3) It's a challenge. Games that aren't challenging aren't anywhere near as enjoyable. I can enjoy them as much as a challenging game very rarely when they have a good story. A good example of this would be To The Moon( Which I'd so reccomend to you all) , but that game was built for story purposes, so it had to have an absolutely spectacular story. This game though is a challenge. I've seen people sob at the challenge because they can't make it past day 3. I see peoiple in shock when people last a month. That frickinEXCITES me. That is amazing. That is a challenge i yearn for. It can quench my hunger for something to struggle against for at least a little while, and it's been a good while since I've found a game truly challenging.  4) This applies mostly to Don't Starve Together, but it needs to be included. I Love co-op games.I love working together with someone to figure things out and I love spending time with people. I am almost addicted to spending time with people. If i don't have contact with people for even a short time I literally get depressed. I'd really love this as an avenue of something to do with people, meet new people, and hang out with old friends.  5) Don't Starve Together is Early Access. It's not a full product. I can help it become a product. I can be part of the development, and that would be so cool. I often see people complain about games being released in a broken state and I also see people saying it's because people buy the early access game and don't give developers feedback. I'd love to be part of the solution. I'd love to be part of the reason that games get released in completed states. And, I'd love to make sure Don't Starve Together is one of the games that is completed on release.  That's most of the major reasons I want this game, but before I go I have one thing I want to do. I want to call /u/makesyoufeeldirty because he didn't get his 1 year of xbox live request filled. I felt really bad for the way people treated him, and I think he really deserves to have that request filled. He deserves it way more than I deserve this game. So even If it lowers my chances please come here and request that subscription. I can always enter the next giveaway he hosts with this amazon card, but you really deserve a chance at that card.  Thanks so much for the giveaway aak. Good luck to everybody else who enters!"

GiftofGames,3curoo,LegendForHire,5,Sat Jul 11 00:56:17 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] PAYDAY 2  The game or preferably (but more expensive) GOTY edition.  My steam profile.  I want this game badly, and have since I first heard of it. My entire life I've been wanting a game about robbing banks and similar, with my friends or otherwise. And when PAYDAY: THE HEIST came out I played it for months. I beat every level on the hardest difficulty, and regretted none of it. When the PAYDAY 2 beta came out I played it for a little while and loved it. It was better than the first in soooo many ways! I never got to play the full game, though, as I shortly after transitioned to PC from PS3. Now, these games excite me so much because I've always loved the aspects of heists (of course not in real life!) They take skill, planning, stealth, and expertise, and of course the reward is worth it all. I honestly don't know what it is that I like so much about the idea of heists and forming a crew, I just love it. It just seems like a lot of fun, and the first game was, so I'm sure this one will be! I would get something like GTA V, but my computer can't run it. I've done lots of research, and luckily, this game will work! Now, not to turn this into a sob story, I know this is hardly relevant, but my dad also died recently and I do kinda need something to take that off my mind. I'm also suffering through college (I expect to have $30k in loans by the time it's over) which makes it hard to pay for anything but electricity, water, shelter, and food. I know this game's a bit pricy compared to everything else in here, but it would make my month. Thanks for reading and good luck everyone!"

GiftofGames,3curoo,squirrellywhirly,7,Sat Jul 11 05:22:52 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Kerbal Space Program   Kerbal Space Program Me   Alright, so, my request is for, as you can see in the above, Kerbal Space Program. Sit back, get cozy, this is going to be a bit of a story.   When I was a little girl, a few of my favorite things were hunting bugs, all things Nintendo, trains, LEGO and...making rockets. My grandfather was a physicist and was adamant that I, his youngest, girliest grandchild would develop a lifelong love for learning and for making awesome things through the process of Engineering. It started with us making a rather simple rocket together: nothing more than a bottle, some vinegar, some baking soda, and cardboard. As I saw it soar up into the sky above our driveway, I was hooked, and the moment it came crashing down, creating a cool, muddy puddle on that hot, fateful summer's day, I knew that I wanted to do it again. And so, begins my journey. I spent the next several years designing and redesigning these rockets. I'd add new parts, play around with the recipe a bit, and as I grew older and more advanced, so did my materials. I found myself drawing concept after concept, and working the models into newer, better designs- always reaching higher, further. Many Barbies and My Little Ponies were sent into the air, for science! I would track how high the rockets got and would strive to always push it just a little further. I conducted test after test, both manned and unmanned, and adhered to the not-so-strictest of guidelines, but hey, no one got hurt!  I don't work with rockets anymore, and I never will on a large scale. The fascination is still there and as I've grown into a twenty-something, my love for space, exploration and Engineering has only grown, and blossomed into something more reserved, something more grown-up, and dare I say, refined- ladylike.   I've been following Kerbal Space Program since it first sprung up, and for various reasons, we've always been just shy of meeting: it's been just outside of my grasp. This is a game that I long for and have a hunger to play; in part, to bring back some of that childish imagination and glee when something of yours flies like you wanted it to,  and also because it's a game that has a certain charm to it. The details are amazing, the characters are adorable, and I almost always want to climb into Let's Plays that I watch. I love how flexible the game is and how it allows for meticulous planning, strategy and precision while also allowing for ridiculousness and reckless abandon. It's a game, wherein, you can't help but marvel in either a feat of your own engineering or proof that miracles exist, depending on the strategy you chose, if you can even call what you chose to do a ""strategy"". Or so I'm told.  I absolutely adore this game, and I know that it would quite quickly become my most played game on Steam."

It's only $15 USD on Steam right now, and apparently the devs are in the midst of finishing up an asset overhaul update followed by AI and combat updates; so I'm incredibly excited to see what they can do to make this game even more amazing!

GiftofGames,3curoo,Sasquatchamunk,5,Sat Jul 11 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Plug & Play http://store.steampowered.com/app/353560 My Profile  I heard about this game a while ago; I actually watched some youtube gamer play it. I think it was Markiplier, or someone like that. At first glance--to me--at least, it seemed like a pretty nonsensical games. There were plugs. And outlets. It was a little weird. And oddly charming. But ultimately, at first, it seemed only to be a jumble of random, unconnected, meaningless scenes. So, my first reaction was ""I dunno what that was, but it was weird and I a little bit liked it."" But a trip to the comments changed my mind on that--I can't remember it in its entirety or word-for-word, but it was something about how really, the game was a commentary on us and the way we connect with each other. How there're those who takes (plugs) and those who give, or are taken from (outlets), and how we so wish we could connect with people similar to us, but sadly outlets cannot connect to outlets and plugs cannot connect to plugs. There was one scene where a plug removes his prongs and tosses them away, but the further you move them from him, tossing them out of the frame and such, the more desperately he follows to retrieve them. The comment theorized how this showed how those of us more prone to taking might try to run from that nature, but ultimately we return to those tendencies because... I don't know. I can't remember. It was probably something like how we return to it because it's familiar, or because it's hard to let go of that selfish tendency of taking, taking, taking.  And that whole comment greatly furthered my interest in the game--not altogether because of the theory of its social commentary, but because it assured--maybe convinced is more the word?--me that the game had a deeper meaning than a bunch of those random unconnected nonsensical scenes; it wasn't just a weird 15-minute game with no connection or relation to anything whatsoever; it's something that means something, that could be interpreted or analyzed in some way, and that's really cool to me. I think it would be a lot cooler and a lot more fun to get to play the game for myself, rather than watching people react to it on youtube."
GiftofGames,3curoo,Freyaka,5,Sat Jul 11 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"Ok here goes [Request][Steam] Kerbal Space Program  http://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1  http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyaka/  My brother has it and I've played it several times. It is the most fun you will ever have while being frustrated enough to punch small kittens. You can build the prettiest space craft that looks like it will take you to the mun and back, and instead it'll blow up on the launch pad and all the while you'll be laughing at how comical it is.  What's so great about playing Kerbal is it is a game that encourages failure, not punishes it. You fail, you realize where you went wrong and revert back to the construction phase and correct it. Each failure gets you closer to success. You may not break orbit the first time (or the 100th) but you'll never grow tired of trying.  The other reason I would really enjoy having it is because I just recently stared using Linux again (I'm mostly a novice when it comes to Linux, but I installed Ubuntu+Mate and it really is user friendly) I got steam installed and played some Borderlands 2, but my steam play library could use some loving!   I don't want to be that guy who whines and moans about how bad he has it. But I will say this. If I don't get the game, my life will go on and I'll have plenty of other things to keep me entertained (heck, Rocket League just came out as a free PS+ game so that alone will entertain for hours!) that being said being a college student (6 classes from my associates!!!) with 3 kids, it'll be awhile before I actually get around to purchasing this on my own. If you pick me, I will for sure enjoy it, but if not someone else is getting a great game of their own and will enjoy it as well. It's a win/win. Thank you for being cool enough to do this!  Good luck to everyone!"
GiftofGames,3curoo,Themanwiththeplan87,5,Sat Jul 11 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"I would like Dungeon Souls. Here is my Steam ID. The reason I would like this game? I would like this game because I love to hate myself, this is evident by similar games I have that make me mad, yet are so rewarding, I love games like Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain, Vagante, and Catacomb Kids. I love the frustration they cause and I love the feeling of victory when RNGesus grants it. I love when it seems like the game might be going my way only to dash my hopes on the jagged rocks of reality. Not only will this game sate my masochistic pleasures, it is also in Early Access, meaning things can get alot more sadistic and twisted as time goes on. Kinda like Nuclear Throne in that regard. I love also the overall dungeon crawl look as it gives it a good amount of character with the functions that it has in game which make it act like Risk of Rain and Nuclear Throne combined. I love the pixel artstyle and the feel the game gives when I watch it. Overall I would love this game, and I would play the hell outta it. So if you indulge me, by getting this game so I can scream/laugh/cry/pray to RNGesus I would love that. Either way whether I get it or not, thanks for doing something like this. I do love it when people are willing to help one another/be fun like this.  Edit: Changed a sentence."
GiftofGames,3curoo,D9sinc,4,Sat Jul 11 05:03:18 2015 UTC,"[Request] [Steam] Infectonator Survivors  Infectonator Survivors Store Page  Steam ID  Why do I want this game? It's simple I used to play the Infectonator series when I was in middle and high school and it was a series I really loved playing since it was a strategy game and it involved zombies (which I absolutely love) so that was a big plus I used to spend a lot of my lunch periods or early morning just relaxing in the library and playing these games and trying to get 3 stars in every stage I played.  When I found out there was an Infectonator game on Steam I got excited I went to go check it out and honestly it looks really awesome. I've been watching development of this game since back in Winter and it looks amazing. You control a group of people trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse and you can equip them and research different things to help you survive in the city and you can go off exploring a city and recruiting more survivors, but because it has Survival aspects you have to make sure your people are fed and you have to make sure you have bullets to fire at enemies. One strange thing I hear from people who play this is that they think it's weird that bullets are used as currency, but to me I see it as they are adopting the currency system of Metro 2033.  I love this game's art style as it's the same type of art work that has been used in the Infectornator's series and apparently features a few easter egg characters from one of Valves games (Hint the characters are from the first one in it's series and has Zombies in it.. .  obviously) So I thought that was pretty cool that you can play as them.  I really don't know how to relay that this game looks amazing and really fun other then what I've said already, but most of that is rambling and lack of experience with the gameplay and such of the game.  Either way I thank you for your time and I wish everyone Good Luck."

GiftofGames,3curoo,thunderyellow,5,Sat Jul 11 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] The Fruit of Grisaia Store link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/345610/ Steam Profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/thunderyellow Well this game is expensive so I think this is a long shot, but it is the only thing that I truly really want for a while, till at least November, so I will try my best here. 1) About me and Visual Novel(VN): I'm a huge fan of Visual Novel as a medium, it's  the best medium for story-telling in my opinion, it's the perfect fusion of story, visual and music, especially story-rich VN like this one with >50 hours of content. I have read quite a lot of VNs, and they are all good (well, because only the best ones got translated to English), some of them even changed how I think, how I look at the world. Before, to read a VN, you usually have to pirate it, because they are not intended for audiences outside of Japan, until recently, when a lot of big names begin to shift oversea, and VN become more well-known in the West. And I also want to support this movement, as I bought quite a bit of VNs on Steam, alas only the cheaper ones, that have good story. My favorite one for now is Planetarian, as you can see in my profile, I have >100 hours in that VN (the game itself is short, only about 6 hours. I reread it 2 times, the rest is time I spent listening to the OST. Yes, the OST is super good, and can be used when studying, so I listened to it quite a lot). 2) About the publisher on Steam of this game: The publisher is Sekai Project, they are one of the first companies that start the surge of VNs to Steam, they ported mainly great VNs, i.e Planetarian, Narcissu, and the up and coming legendary Clannad... aside from some pretty questionable ones like Sakura Spirit, Sakura Angel, but overall I think they are worth supported. With the coming of Clannad this November, I really want to support this company :D 3) About the game itself: This Visual Novel is, in my opinion, the best one on Steam right now. Before its announcement to come on Steam, I have pirated it, and read about a half of a character's ending(there's 5 ending here) but stopped after the announcement, to read it after buying it legitimately, although I still can't afford it, it's more expensive than I expected. Thus, I have only experienced the game for ~7,8 hours, but these things are what I feel: -The art is beautiful, well designed. This is anime-styled so maybe there are people who don't like it, but it's great for me. -The music are great, I couldn't listened all the track because they are revealed as the game progress, but they are all nice and fit the theme. -The character are well designed, all have depths. They may seems to be a stereotype character as first, but as you progress, you will discover a lot, shocking truth too. -The plot are well-written, it may seems slow at first, when the characters are being introduced, but it will pick up. And even the slow, casual parts at the start are very good, as they give a lot of insights of the characters. This VN has all kind of genre inside it: the start are usually light-hearted slice of life scene, full of comedy gold, but as the story goes on, it become serious, and even dark. -The humor: this VN has great comedy factor, the scenes are usually hilarious, very funny, with the help of great translations that make it so enjoyable. I'm still very surprised a fan-translation can be that good. From the things I collected above, the reviews of people who have read this VN, and with the experience of reading quite a lot of VNs before, I believe that I will definitely enjoy this VN tremendously, so if this request is actually fulfilled, that would make me very happy. Thank you and /u/TheAzureDragon very much for this chance, thanks everyone who read this post till here, I appreciated it. :)"

GiftofGames,3curoo,FantasyHeaven,5,Sat Jul 11 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Dynasty Warriors 8: XL  http://store.steampowered.com/app/278080  http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantasyheaven/    Dynasty Warriors 8 is a hack-and-slash action game based on the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The historical novel was written in the 14th century and is regarded as one of the top four of China's classical literature. It covers the century-long conflict during the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdom period following it in China.   The overview of the plot is that due to the nefarious machinations of the eunuchs in the imperial court, corruption became widespread in the government at all levels of office. This eventually led to the Yellow Turban rebellion, led by Zhang Jiao (a playable character). In the novel, he was portrayed as a mystical Taoist - this is reflected in the game by him being a sorcerer with a staff. While the uprising was popular amongst the people, its lack of talented generals became evident after the empire's vassals were called upon to assist in dealing with the rebellion and the threat posed by the Yellow Turbans was contained with Zhang Jiao's death in 184 AD. Still, the Yellow Turbans had dealt a crippling blow to both the imperial army and the emperor's authority. With the emperor's death soon after in 189 AD, the empire quickly fell apart with the vassals acting autonomously - becoming warlords.    The game has a cast of 82 playable characters, with the male characters being the warlords and generals that were given focus in the novel. The majority of the characters are historical - they actually did exist during said time period.  The core gameplay is simple: choose a character, and then and go through levels that represent the battles that the chosen character had participated in (according to the novel). In addition to the aforementioned ""historical"" missions, the game also have ""hypothetical"" scenarios where the factions that were defeated historically ends up winning instead.  As a hack-and-slash game, the playable characters are portrayed as superhuman - the higher you are on the chain of military command the more capable you are at fighting. The playable characters can cut through waves of enemy soldiers and their actions alone can turn the tide of battle.  I have never played a Dynasty Warriors game before, but from what I can tell from gameplay videos, the formula hasn't really changed much throughout the franchise and its spin-offs. I did enjoy playing games from the spin-off franchises (Warriors Orochi and Dynasty Warriors: Gundam) though.    The main reason that I want to play this game is because I am a fan of the historical novel. I am interested in both reenacting the notable battles in the novel and seeing the hypothetical scenarios.  The battle that I wish to re-enact the most is the battle of Hefei. Historically, Zhang Liao's feats in said battle was something that wouldn't be out of place in a hack-and-slash game - it cemented his position as Cao Cao's best general. When Sun Quan's army of 100 000 surrounded Hefei, Zhang Liao and his army of 7000 was given the order to attack. Leaving the rest behind as garrison, he led a cavalry of 800 and charged towards Sun Quan's banner. Sun Quan was shocked by this bold move, so he ordered his men in a defensive formation and retreated to higher ground. Once Zhang Liao's numbers were whittled down to around 100 riders, Sun Quan was emboldened and order his army to surround Zhang Liao in many layers. However, Zhang Liao was able to break through the encirclement with a few scores of soldiers. The men still trapped in the encirclement despaired: ""Our general abandoned us!"". Hearing this, Zhang Liao charged back into the encirclement and was able to safely lead the rest of his cavalry out. Sun Quan's army was stunned by Zhang Liao's valor and did not act to impede him when he retreated back into Hefei in order to fortify defenses in preparation for the inevitable siege. This act by Zhang Liao greatly bolstered the morale of his men and deflated that of Sun Quan's army. The siege lasted for ten days, but an outbreak of plague for Sun Quan to call for a retreat. As Sun Quan (and about 1000 soldiers) was acting as the rearguard, Zhang Liao saw this as an opportunity to pursue, and led all his cavalry in an all-out charge. And he would have been able to capture Sun Quan too if it weren't for Ling Tong's men of 300 sacrificing themselves in order to buy time for Sun Quan to flee.  As for the hypothetical scenarios, I want to see how much liberties the developers will take in order to give ""good"" endings to the historically defeated factions. Given that both the Shu and Wu factions were destined to fall (a simple matter of geography and population size that their land can sustain), I am curious to see if Koei is able to create a chain of believable scenarios where they don't get wiped out. I am under the impression that the hypothetical scenarios exist to let certain playable characters outlive their historical selves. The most obvious case of this would be Guo Jia, whose cause of death in the novel was illness - how is completing certain battle objectives going to change that? That said, in the novel Cao Cao did lament after his loss at the battle of Red Cliffs that it would not have happened if Guo Jia was still with him - having him there would be a valid justification for any changes in the battle's outcome."

The first and most plainly apparent reason is that it has one of the highest 'average time played' stats of any game, and I have an absolutely enormous amount of time to fill with playing games (for reasons I won't get into here). I did play the demo for several hours so I know that I will at least enjoy it enough to give it more than just quick passing glance. Also, my best friend, and fellow gamer that I have spent more time playing games with than all others combined, plays Civ V and he has told me that we could really have a bunch of fun playing the game together. Getting this ""not-that-old but still new enough for me"" game would really help me get some quality time in with my friend, and also keep my mind occupied while possibly learning and entertaining me too.

GiftofGames,3curoo,mikebrown_pelican,4,Sat Jul 11 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"Lyne - $2.99  Steam  This isn't an AAA title or even that well known of a game (I think?). I stumbled upon it recently and it looks really fun. Fun as in not the hardcore-fastpaced-first-person-shooter fun, but the more relaxing play-this-game-on-the-car-ride-home type of game. I love puzzle games, and love relaxing games that do not have a 'time limit'. This game fits both. It falls right in the place where I can play it when I have half an hour to kill, but don't want to start up a competitive CSGO or start a quest on Skyrim. This is definitely a game I will play - more offline than online - because it's a really casual game. It's not much, but I'd love it if I could have it.  OH, PS: About Payday 2 I got from you. I tried to run it. I honestly did. I couldn't get more than 15-17 FPS on it. I assure you I will play it whenever I get access to a better PC or get myself a new one. Apparently my current PC is not meant for games like that. This on the other hand  will run just fine. Sorry, and thank you once again."

I love the setting, the combat, the hunting, and the parkour. The game is practically perfect for me as my favorite two genres are open world and stealth! But the thing that I love the most about the game is battling on the sea in your ship! I love pirates, and have deeply researched their history time and time again just for fun! When I was very young I even guessed Blackbeard's real name (Well, I guessed Edward Peach, but close enough.)! In fact one of my favorite games of all time is Sid Meier's Pirates! I love exploring the various ports, dancing with governors daughters, and epic naval battles with swordfish galore! However, I have always wished there were more games where piratical adventure was at every corner. And as it turns out, there is one! Which brings us to Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag. As a combination of my newfound love for Assassin's Creed, as well as my old passion for everything pirate, this game would be so much fun for me! If someone would be nice enough to get it for me, I would be amazingly grateful. Thank you for reading anyways. Here is my Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fledgeland Thank you!"

Simply put, any lego game that was put out on release such as Lego Star Wars, Indiana Jones, heck I even played the online Lego Universe until servers were shut down two years ago.

GiftofGames,3curoo,fluvance,4,Sat Jul 11 02:53:15 2015 UTC,"Wow generous giveaway!  I'd really like to play The Talos Principal (Read the last paragraph before/if you choose me as a recipient). I played through the demo, and absolutely loved it. In case you haven't read up on it before, it's basically a more detailed version of Portal. It has a really awesome medieval theme, while still bringing a lot of challenge with the puzzles. To top it off, there are some goals that are bigger than just the basic challenges, such as finding little trinkets around the world. Overall, even though I've only played Portal (Will be playing Portal 2 soon as well), I think this game really gives Valve's games a run for their money.   I've always found puzzle games to be great fun. There's something special about sitting down for a few hours and just working your way through some tricky thinking. Like a physical puzzle. The fact that games like these also combine the first person aspect with that is what makes them so wonderful for me. Really helps to immerse me even more in the experience.  I have been looking for sales for a while, but haven't quite found one good enough for me. However, Nuuvem now has it for pretty cheap. It is $52BRZ, which translates to $16.45USD. That is almost the lowest price it's ever been during the Summer sale. I was going to wait until it eventually went down to somewhere around $5, but that will be many months/years. So, finding a gifter on GoG would be stellar, and I can finally continue the game.  Thanks for the giveaway!  Steam ID"

[Request]Software Inc. http://store.steampowered.com/app/362620/ http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069431598/ I have always loved simulation and management games. This game might not be as polished as other similar games  like game dev story and is still in alpha, but I think this game is promising. I really like the many aspects of this game like hiring developers and programmers, building and decorating your building, and developing operating systems, game engines, games, and more! :D  I hope to be able to replay this game and approach it differently each time. The random names for programmers as well as the various approaches that can be made add replay-ability to this game. Various customization aspects for your building are fantastic. Add bathrooms, Tvs, build rooms to your liking, and change the way temperature is in each room. You can make various programming teams and make ""sequels"" or successors to your already existing programs. As an aspiring programmer this game really intrigues me and would be a fun experience. EDIT: Played a demo! :D Now I know that this game has even more to it! You can outbuy competition! It is way tougher than expected. Had to start from a 3x3 room! CRAZY! Taking on contacts is easier than spending 80% of your budget just for one OS license. You got to start humbly. You can manage teams and have to make sure to hire staff to have your office cleanes, and maintained. You can see your product reviewed. You go through desiging, development alpha, beta , and release. This game has great detail. You can buy more land and there are various possible workers to be hired you can interview. The prospect worker quality depends the money on your insurance fund and how it is dstributed( whether you have high pensions or life insurance.) This game is so good for an early access game on steam. It is THE game I have been waiting for. Combining game dev story and the sims."

I want it mainly for the Call of Duty: Zombies mode, which in this version you can make custom maps and download other people's custom maps.  The maps are really fun. Zombies mode is when you go into a map, and you have to try to make it to the max round you can. My highest round is on Call of Duty Black Ops 2 on Xbox 360 on round 33 on a map called Buried.  It's a very fun game mode and I'd be super happy if you gifted me this game.

[REQUEST][STEAM] Elite: Dangerous  Steam Account: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132041668/  Game:http://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/  As you can see, this game is a space sim. It's like Euro Truck Simulator in space.  Well, I've always been fascinated by space. I like to just stare at one star and imagine how many planets orbit that star, how the planets look,  what the alien creatures do, can they travel faster that the speed of light etc. etc. I even want to buy a nice telescope and look at the planets in our solar system, but telescopes cost a lot (for example the Dobsonian XT10 costs between 300€-700€). I can only ""experience"" space travel through games. I tried A LOT of space sims, but none of them can scratch the itch. The closest thing was Space Engine (a cool free program, download it rite nao), but I couldn't fly spaceships, mine, trade and fight. I didn't want to pay a monthly fee for EVE and it just wasn't my type of game. And Star Citizen isn't even out yet (sadly).  But I recently found Elite: Dangerous. My god, it's everything  that I wanted. Just look at the describtion:  Elite: Dangerous is the definitive massively multiplayer space epic, bringing gaming’s original open world adventure to the modern generation with a connected galaxy, evolving narrative and the entirety of the Milky Way re-created at its full galactic proportions.   Starting with only a small starship and a few credits, players do whatever it takes to earn the skill, knowledge, wealth and power to survive in a futuristic cutthroat galaxy and to stand among the ranks of the iconic Elite. In an age of galactic superpowers and interstellar war, every player’s story influences the unique connected gaming experience and handcrafted evolving narrative. Governments fall, battles are lost and won, and humanity’s frontier is reshaped, all by players’ actions.   400 Billion Star Systems. Infinite Freedom. Blaze Your Own Trail.   A Galaxy Of Wonders  The 400 billion star systems of the Milky Way are the stage for Elite: Dangerous' open-ended gameplay. The real stars, planets, moons, asteroid fields and black holes of our own galaxy are built to their true epic proportions in the largest designed playspace in videogame history.   A Unique Connected Game Experience Governments fall, battles are lost and won, and humanity’s frontier is reshaped, all by players’ actions. In an age of galactic superpowers and interstellar war, every player’s personal story influences the connected galaxy and handcrafted evolving narrative.   Blaze Your Own Trail Upgrade your ship and customize every component as you hunt, explore, fight, mine, smuggle, trade and survive in the cutthroat galaxy of the year 3301. Do whatever it takes to earn the skill, knowledge, wealth and power to stand among the ranks of the Elite.   Massively Multiplayer  Experience unpredictable encounters with players from around the world in Elite: Dangerous’ vast massively multiplayer space. Experience the connected galaxy alone in Solo mode or with players across the world in Open Play, where every pilot you face could become a trusted ally or your deadliest enemy. You will need to register a free Elite: Dangerous account with Frontier to play the game.   A Living Game Elite: Dangerous grows and expands with new features and content. Major updates react to the way players want to play and create new gameplay opportunities for the hundreds of thousands of players cooperating, competing and exploring together in the connected galaxy.   The Original Open World Adventure Elite: Dangerous is the third sequel to 1984's genre-defining Elite, bringing gaming’s original open world adventure into the modern generation with a connected galaxy, evolving narrative and the entire Milky Way re-created at its full galactic proportions.  You can explore OUR OWN GALAXY! All the nebulas and stars that you've heard about on the internet are actually there!  You wanna go to the Orion Nebula? Sure, go and have a look at it.  You'd like to visit our space neighbour Proxima Centauri? Say ""Hi"" from me!  You wanna blaze a trail to the Horse Head Nebula? Neigh worries.  This is seriously one of the best space sims. And it's constantly getting updated!  The Things I like about this game:  Everything. I like every little feature. I like all the 400 billion stars. I like every colourful nebula. I like every massive black hole. I like every cold, lifeless asteroid. It's just the perfect game for me.   TL;DR I was born in the wrong generation, help me cope with it."

GiftofGames,3curoo,Livingthepunlife,4,Sat Jul 11 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Rust  Link to the game on steam.  Give your steam profile link  Write your request.:  So a few months ago (10, to be precise), I started playing Planetside 2. Within my first day, I had joined an outfit (PS2's equivalent of a guild) and over the past 10 months we have been playing games together. Before and during my time with these guys (I'm still playing with them regularly), I was massively into survival games. It even hit a point where I started a YouTube channel for my Space Engineers experience (however, I shut it down a few weeks in when I realised my voice and mic quality were terrible). I bought 7 Days to Die around Update 6 or 7, and have clocked in some modest hours in that. In the recent release of 1.3 Terraria, we all pitched in to rent out a server and I broke the 100 hour barrier in that game (with so much left to do!).  The reason why I want Rust so bad is because as I said above, I'm a survival nut. There's something so fun about waking up with nothing and working your way to the top (much like games you find on /r/incremental_games) with the added difficulty of designing a stable house, trying to figure out what the hell you can make from a plank of wood and a rock and having to look on a wiki to find out what exactly you just looted on that raid. And while it is a lot of fun to play these sorts of games alone, it's even more fun to play with friends. I wouldn't have made it to the WoF in Terraria if it weren't for my friends there to help me out, laugh at my mistakes and crack some jokes. Likewise, I want to be there in Rust to laugh at them (in jest, nothing too mean, of course), make jokes and explore. I really just want the chance to play with these guys in a game that we can all enjoy."

I would truly appreciate this game that is ESO (elder scrolls online).  It's an MMO set in the elder scrolls universe and you can travel all across Tamriel in it.   The Elder Scrolls franchise is a first person adventure singleplayer rpg that inspired ZenimaxOnline to make a MMO out of .  You wake up in a dark cold prison cell hearing screams and loud noises. it sounds like a riot and that's exactly what it is. The Daedric Lord Molag Bal has imprisoned you in his realm of Coldharbour where the souls he has claimed resides.  You must escape back to Tamriel and go on a journey to fight in the upcoming war between the 3 alliances of Tamriel.  The Ebonheart pact.  The Aldmeri Dominion.  The Daggerfall covenant.  Each alliance has their own reasons why they want to rule over tamriel and wichever one you choose to be a part of will decide where you will go and what quests and people you'll meet.  Now i played this during the beta and i liked it but it was extremely unfinished and broken so i ended up cancelling my pre-order after the last beta event wich was less then a month before launch and with the amount of bugs it had i realized i'd be wasting my money.   I've still followed it and read about the patches and a while ago 2-3 months i think there was a welcome back event where beta players could return to the game for free for one weekend.  I loved it. Absolutely loved it, It was so much better then when i played it in the beta. Everything had changed for the better and i was hooked. I ended up  making a nord warrior and joined the Ebonheart pact wich consists of Nords, Argonians and dark elves all united to fight against the other alliances.  The lvling was really fun and quests felt rewarding and overall exploration was very fun. I tried out all of the classes and got them all to about lvl 10 to get a feel for them and i ended up really loving the dragon knight class wich is more tanky/warrior with fire abillitys and crazy ultimates and team buffs.  I didn't really get into the social aspect of the game while i was playing but the chatrooms were active and group dungeons were fun (did 2 of them).   I've been following this game since it's beta and i frequently lurk in /r/elderscrollsonline and it's a great game now!   /r/elderscrollsonline is a pretty friendly sub with a nice community wich i'd like to be a part of very much and overall everything about this game really appeals to me and i would put in hundreds of hours into it.   Thank you again /u/AakashMasani & Azure for doing this giveaway and goodluck everyone!"
GiftofGames,3curoo,heartscrew,4,Sat Jul 11 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm at a real lost for what to write here. The Risen series isn't exactly known to deliver a great, nay, even a good RPG experience. It just lacks so much in so many aspects. I mean, it tries to be it's own thing and it tries to be good, but it ultimately falls short of what makes a memorable RPG. I'm not saying the game has no merits(the gnome companion in R2 is a favorite of mine, dealing with heathen voodoo magic with hot lead is another thing I like), but at most, for me(don't take my word for it though, I'm not a definitive game reviewer... yet) sometimes it feels like a bad game going to being mediocre. But I cannot, for the life of me, get the feeling that I'll be missing something if I skip out on Risen 3. Many things have changed from Risen 2 and as far as the videos tell, the best parts of Risen 1 has been added back to it.

Since then I've played every single GTA game, even the PS2 ones (Which was an amazing upgrade from my then PC :P)  When GTA V was announced I was so excited about it but then I got saddened since it was console only. But then I remembered a fact that Rockstar always releases games for consoles first, then PC. I never lost hope that GTA V was gonna come PC, I was one of the first few hundred people that signed the petition for PC version even though I knew it was gonna be out. And now here we are.  Honestly I was really impressed by the trailers. It exceeded my expectations. I didn't expect it to look that good and detailed. Then GTA online was introduced and I was blown away. It looked like there was just so much fun to be had there. It literally looked like an MMORPG (Well, at least for me)   Unfortunately I cannot get the game at the moment because it's way too expensive in our country (1/6 of minimum wage if that makes a difference.) I was hoping to get it during summer sale but we all know how that went...  Anyways I wish everyone good luck and thank you for doing this giveaway."
GiftofGames,3curoo,Pwnclub,4,Sat Jul 11 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the opportunity! ~(o_o)~ [REQUEST][STEAM] Shovel Knight I've requested this game a few times, so I'll copy what I have written previously instead of replacing it. Shovel Knight is a retro platformer where you control a knight with a shovel. It seems like loads of fun, and I've wanted it since I saw the Kickstarter a long time ago. In fact, it's been on my Steam wishlist since July 29th of last year- so almost a full year. 2-D platformers are my favorite kind of games- especially difficult ones. I have roughly 70 hours in Super Meat Boy, 20 hours in Rogue Legacy, and plenty of other times in games like Gunpoint, Limbo, Braid, FEZ, etc, so this kind of game really appeals to me. I also love NES/SNES classics such as Legends of Zelda, Megaman, Metroid and Mario World, so I find the artstyle to be fantastic. Shovel Knight was probably most directly inspired by DuckTales, an NES classic that also has the game mechanic of doing a ""pogo attack"" in the air. I loved that game, but it had flaws (being so old and in the early years of level design), which are fixed in this new game. Shovel Knight is fairly linear, although sometimes you are given an option between several levels. I really like this format for games (which is why I love Super Mario World). There's an inventory that reminds me strongly of the brilliant Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Furthermore, there are checkpoints throughout the levels that you can either use, or break for lots of loot. This just sounds awesome, and I can't wait to gamble with this feature. This game also has received very high reviews, and its PC version has an 85%. Shovel Knight has plenty of achievements, which is something that I find really appealing. I recently hit 1000 achievements, and I have been trying to get the rarest achievements I possibly can, which you can see if you look at my profile. :P As to what goes on in the game and what the ultimate goal is, I don't honestly really know. For games that I really want, I avoid watching in the gameplay in advance so that I can go into the game blind and get the most of it. But I have seen the trailer and a bit of Total Biscuit's WTF Is... Shovel Knight , and I know this is a game that I'll love. I'd be absolutely thrilled to receive this game, and if I do I'll play the hell out of it! Thanks a bunch for reading this request, and have a great day! :D Steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/pwnclub Shovel Knight on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/"

GiftofGames,3curoo,SunshineZz,4,Mon Jul 13 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  LINK TO THE GAME!  STEAM ID!  Beginning of the game!                                                **REQUEST**   Have you ever seen something, but not really spectated for more than a couple of seconds and there in that moment after only a glimpse you knew that this was the thing you were looking for so long? For so long sounds slighly overexaggerated since I've only been gaming for like 10 years (yes super mario counts as gaming, deal with it), but considered it's more than half of my life (16 years old) it's a fair amount of time. When I was a child I liked exploring and the fact I lived in a village made it possible to do so. I used to wonder around in nature all by myself and just enjoy in the beautiful nature not even knowing how careless I was back then. Chasing butterflies and picking up flowers for the cute girl nextdoor, yeah that's something I could, if given the opportunity, get back to in a snap. I was read a lot of fairytales when I was a child and apart from Andersen's and the Grimm brother's stories I really liked the traditional serbian ones. Most of them possess princesses and princes, dragons, snakes, swords, axes and in majority of the cases the good guy wins and saves the day by killing the mythical creature. Now imagine if you could do that, be the good guy, save your girl in a badass style and get paid while doing so, come on you have to admit it sounds pretty cool. I remember my first open world game Gates of Andaron I literaly got lost with my first created characted I wondered so far that I didn't know how to get back so I just created a new one. After that I tried a little bit of Skyrim, Minecraft, TERA, AION, Assasins Creed, Far Cry, Gothic, NFS, Prototype (this list is endless so let's just stop here). There is something about those open world games that holds you, maybe the feeling of freedom or possibility of choices I'm not entirely sure. The fact that you can have multiple choice dialogue makes this game even better because you can actually choose the parts of the story you want to see and which not. In other words you can finish this game 3 times and you still won't play ""exactly"" the same game, which is in my opinion pretty damn awesome. For the bookworms out there, there  is also a serie of witcher books, unfortunately they aren't really accessible in Serbia but as soon as I can grab one for myself I will. I can't really comment on how well does the game represent the books so I won't. Before a couple of months my friends dragged me to the cinema and we watched the seventh son, if you want a movie of a witcher that's the one you should definetly look into.                                         **The Witcher 3 story**   The first thing you aknowledge when seeing the game is the awesome graphics it provides. It's absolutely stunning. It requires a decent video card but if you don't really care about the fabulous hair flopping (hairworks) it will run on decent settings without spending your retirement fond. I truly adore every aspect of this game, but the biggest pro of this game is it's story. I mean honestly, who doesn't like a good story, it doesn't matter if it's a book, movie, series or game a good story will be recognized and rewarded. That is exactly what happened with witcher 3. Compared to some other game budgets like Destiny and GTA 5 , the creators of witcher made an awesome job on assembling it all together. So let's get into the story of the witcher 3.   You are having a nightmare about Kaer Morhen - a witcher school where you, Geralt of Rivia, have spent time learning how to become a witcher. You are dreaming about your beloved, Yeneffer and your not blood bounded daughter Ciri, that might be learning how to become a witcher without permission. Ciri, after she has been taken back to Vesemir, gets kidnapped by the phantom army and just as you want the story to go on you wake up by a campfire, sitting next to your mentor Vesemir - an old witcher. He asks what's the matter and you explain him (or don't depends on your dialogue decision). You're a bit shaken up but you are alright, you get a letter in which you are summoned to Vizima. You are looking for Yeneffer but she actually finds you after a tavern incident. She tells you that Emhyr var Emeris, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, has summoned you to Vizima. When you get there you get a task to find your daughter who has already started the wild hunt. That's the moment when you also do the same thing.   I didn't want to spoil the game anymore for all of you who actually want to give it a go. This is the only game I want currently, I know it's expensive and that it's quite greedy of me to ask for it but if there is a slightest chance of me getting the possibility to play it I will go for it. If you decide to play the game please don't forget to play out (or walkthrough) the first two parts of the game just to have all the dots connected, but the third part is a story for itself. I'd like to thank you /u/AakashMasani and your friend  /u/TheAzureDragon for giving us the opportunity to get access to this wonderful game. I will be getting my pc parts soon but I can't squeeze out enough to buy the game too. Thank you for reading this, good luck to everyone!  FYI :I edited some grammar mistakes."
GiftofGames,3curoo,icanhasreclaims,5,Sat Jul 11 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the giveaway, but I am withdrawing my entry.  * [Request][Steam] BeamNG.drive * http://store.steampowered.com/app/284160  Also, please see link at the end.(cheaper) * http://steamcommunity.com/id/drinkleadsoup/ Okay, so this is my second entry.  No, not like that...  I actually wrote out a pretty nice entry in the comment box, then I got a new message, so I clicked on it, and POOF! everything I had just written was gone.  This version will be a mix of what I can recall along with some copypasta from an entry I had previously written about the game. I am really hoping to get BeamNG.drive. I initially wrote BeamNG.drive off of my wishlist during the Summer Sale, as I thought it may get boring. But... I can't stop watching youtube videos of the crashes! This video pretty much says it all. And, this... this is another great crash compilation Sorry about these, they are Steam links to gifs.  Game vs. Real Life Physics Incredible Crashes! And, overall mayhem and Destruction! fixed that one. I mean this is literally all I have ever done with every driving game from *Gran Turismo** to GTA V. Eventually, I get around to completing missions, objectives, and winning races. But the very first playthroughs are always, ""Let's see what happens when I crash the car Liiiiiike THIS.""  Playing with the physics in car games is important/fun for me because it is something that you can't do IRL. And, I guess that is why I play games anyway. Just an escape from the monotony of daily routines. The physics in BeamNG are nothing short of remarkable. And, while it may get old for some, I feel like BeamNG will make for tons of metal-smashing fun. The reviews for BeamNG have seemed to improve since the last update.  And, the development team seems to be focused on creating the best game that they can. The dev team has released a mod manager, but they do not have Steam workshop mods.  I am hoping this will be added at some point.  I have looked for a development roadmap to see what new features they plan to offer, but I can't seem to find anything.  The list of features they add during each update is packed and constantly improving.  I can see BeamNG paving the way for crash physics in so many games that we will see on upcoming game engines. Overall, it just seems like a great game.  It makes for nice video creation too.  I am hoping to begin making some videos of my gameplay in the games where I see wild and crazy happenings.  This game will offer many hours of editing crash sequences for the world to hopefully enjoy. I guess that pretty much sums up my request.  Thank you for the offer, and I hope some folks get the games they have been wanting. And, for what it's worth, I'm not sure how you'll be purchasing the games, but on BeamNG's website, the game can be ordered for $19.99 instead of the Steam price of $24.99.  And, you get a DRM-free copy with this too. If I get BeamNG.drive, I will pretty much have all the games that I currently hope to get in my library.  So, I will not need to make any requests, but I will still be here doing giveaways when I can afford it. Again, thank you for spreading the generosity.  That is really awesome what /u/TheAzureDragon did.  Random acts of Awesomeness. Hope you're having a great day."

If you check my steam history I've played 21 hours of the walking dead +season 2. And I've also spent another 5.6 hours on The Wolf Among Us. Even though I know that the game is completely scripted I still love the feeling you get when a decision you made earlier heavily impacts on current events, and with Life Is Stranges time travel mechanic... well it just sounds like a perfect mix. Also teenagers blah blah, I'm 17 myself so maybe I can relate to some aspects of the story (probably not though, I live in a rural af town, nothing interesting ever happens here haha.)   Additionally, I'm going for a different developer than telltale right now because it seems that they might be spreading themselves a bit thinly. Originally I really wanted Tales From the Borderlands or GoT, but their episodes are releasing incredibly slowly, so I thought I'd give a different dev a shot, apparently Life is Strange gives even the best Telltale games a run for their money, which sounds great.   Anyway, If you are to pick me, I'd love the complete season, but if there are more people you can gift with the money you would save by only buying me the first episode that's cool too. Have a good one, and thanks for the giveaway! :)"
GiftofGames,3curoo,AnghellicKarma,3,Sat Jul 11 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Game: Grand Theft Auto V Steam profile link    Alright, a bit new at this (and to pc gaming), so here's my attempt :)  The game I'm looking for is Grand Theft Auto V for PC.   Why? Well, that's interesting. You see, I only just became a PC gamer in the past month or so. Prior to that, I was a console gamer for over 25 years!     What happened to win me over? Well basically, with Dragon Age Inquisition coming out, I decided to replay Dragon Age Origins. I had it on PC (via Origins giveaways) so I figured I'd replay it there and see how different it might be. And then I discovered mods for it, and it was glorious. So much so that I went ahead and bought Dragon Age II for PC to play it next. And, well, when I was done that, I had DAI for PS4 that I'd gotten for Christmas but never opened, and I went ahead and traded it in at Walmart for the PC version (thank you Walmart for your return policies). Anyway, my machine wasn't powerful enough, so I ordered parts and built one myself (my first time, too!)    Now, what I keep hearing is that GTA5 is the way to see the big leap between console and PC gaming. I had hoped to score it in the Steam Summer sale, but that didn't work out. I still have it at on my Wishlist, but I'd really like to get that game and see what all the hype is about!    Also of note is that I never did get it or play it for console, either, so the experience as a whole would be new to me, and would be on PC as well."
GiftofGames,3curoo,that_c00l_kid,3,Sat Jul 11 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Audiosurf 2  Here is a link to the game  Here is my Steam ID  I have a friend who is Steam shared with me, and I though, ""Hey, I'll give this game a try.""  I'm a HUGE fan on Rock 'n Roll, and normally games like this only work with techno songs, at least when I try them.  I went ahead and searched for songs.  I looked for You Shook Me All Night Long by AC/DC.  I thought it was going to be a little game, like ""Yeah sure this is O.K.""  I found a live version, very high quality I should add, and I got INTO it!  This isn't just another one of ""those"" games.  This isn't a bust (HA get it?? Rock or Bust? Their new album? eh, never mind. Moving on...).  This game was well designed, and boy, when I turned up my headphones, I felt like I wasn't even at my house. I felt I was somewhere else, not even exaggerating!  I've been searching for you don't even know how long, for a game which takes a song you like, and plays along with it, and it's GOOD. This one surpasses my expectations so much I can't explain ^(good for you who got my Who reference).  I can't believe I found a game which finally gives me the experience I want.  There isn't much more I can say, but boy if you saw my face when the song kicked in and the game went from calm to fast pace and managed to get a picture.....you would be able to make fun of me sooo bad ;)  I just played Heartache Tonight and The Long Run (both by my favorite band ;) Eagles)  Oh my god the pump, the beat, the sway, I can't even describe the way it played those songs, but it was phenomenal!!!

GiftofGames,3curoo,NotLaurensReddit,4,Sun Jul 12 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"[Request][Steam] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  Steam Profile  Hey! To start it off, thank you immensely for the giveaway, especially one of this magnitude! The game i'm requesting is The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.  Why I Want The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:  I only recently got into the Witcher series. I bought the Witcher enhanced edition and Witcher 2 enhanced edition bundle that was on sale on GOG about a two months ago and ever since then I've fallen in love with the series. I've probably dropped over 80 or so hours into both games combined and i have to say they are amazing. Witcher 1 was somewhat of a pain due to its rough controls and older graphics but the story was very very fun to play and Witcher 2 was just amazing. There is just so much gameplay in these games whether its sidequests or the main story, these games will keep you busy for a really long time. Besides the obviously amazing story, the Witcher 2 has some pretty nice graphics/scenery for a game that's almost 4 years old.  My main love for The Witcher series comes from how well they pull of the RPG aspects of the game. The games are filled with deep and engaging landscapes, NPC's and most of all lore. One of my favorite aspects of Skyrim and why it is probably my all time favorite RPG is the lore surrounding the Elder scroll world and thats one thing that the Witcher also does amazingly well. The world the Witcher is set in is just so unique, vast and interesting. There will probably always be some new piece of lore or backstory that i have yet to learn. Not only that but whether it was the characters or the landscape, the soundtrack, the scenery, the voice acting, there were just so many little things that added up to make the ambiance and atmosphere of this game so perfect and engrossing. Overall, it just does an amazing job at allowing the player to truly role-play as Geralt.  Now thats just the preface to why i want the Witcher 3, but there just so much more to why i want it than the fact that i've loved the previous games. And the first and most obvious has to be the size and beauty of the open world. The Witcher 3's open world is literally 3.5 times the size of Skyrims, making it immensely huge and one of the biggest open worlds out there in video games. Not only is the open world huge but it is truly truly gorgeous. Every part of the map is just so detailed and beautiful, whether its the leaves flowing in the wind or the water flowing in the river or in a pond. The game is just so detailed and beautiful. Its not very often that i actually feel like taking my time to travel through an open-world rather than just using whatever trip skip function it has. Just watch this video, whether your on a beach near the coast, in the dense forests or in a village, there is just so much attention to detail. The shrubbery and wild life, the animals and monsters, the sun and the skys, almost every aspect of this game is stunning.  Not only is the open world huge and gorgeous but the side-quests will keep you busy for an eternity. Seriously, CDPR really knows how to pack in as much in a game as possible. They did the same with Witcher 2, and now with Witcher 3. They just bombard the games with enough side-quests to keep you playing for dozens of hours even after you've already beat the main story line. And these aren't just some crappy side-quests (like many of the ones in Skyrim) were you just go to a place on the map, clear a wave of monsters, collect an item and comeback. They have substance (from what i've seen) to them. They're like mini-campaigns within the game, you want to see what happens, you want to complete them, and you actually enjoy completing them. Not only that, but CDPR just recently announced that there new patch would be adding an expansion basically the size of Witcher 2, adding in almost 30 more hours of unique gameplay. That is just completely mind-blowing.  Oh and the soundtrack, the freakin soundtrack! I haven't heard the soundtrack for the Witcher 3 yet (as i believe its best to first experience it while playing the game) but there Witcher 1 and 2 both had phenomenal soundtracks. They just added another layer of depth to the games and there are even some songs that i've downloaded and listen to frequently!  Now i can't really say how well the story-line/campaign mode is as i've only looked at reviews and played a bit of the game myself, but from what i've seen that others have said, it seems extraordinary. If CDPR managed to keep the writing and the story as interesting as in the Witcher 2, then i would say they did an amazing job. Many reviewers on Steam and other websites are saying that both the campaign and writing are some of the best they have ever seen, even better than in the Witcher 2 (which i find hard to believe). Honestly, from all these reviews I've read and game-play videos i've seen, im extremely hyped for this game.  Yet another reason to love the Witcher 3, is the dozens of alternate endings. Witcher 3 has 36 different alternate endings, 36 different freaking ways to end the game. That in of itself is mind blowing and shows how much work CDPR put into this game. Not only that but it shows that the decisions you make in the Witcher 3 as Geralt truly matter. Everything you do or say has consequences, your choices as the player matter, its different than other big triple A titles, were regardless of what you do or say, you end up with the same outcome. The decisions mattering is yet another reason why The Witcher 3 is such an amazing RPG, you are truly role playing as Geralt, and what decisions you make and what you do really matters.  And lastly and a huge reason i want this game is because of CDPR. CDPR has always been such an amazing dev. They genuinely care about the happiness of their consumers, they really want to make the best game that they can and from the videos i've seen and from the press releases, they are very sincere. It is very clear that they care more about making a good game then making money. Not only that but the level of support they give there games is incredible. Its only been about two months since the game has been released and they've already released a bunch of free additions through patches. Not only that but as i've said previously, they're adding a huge expansion to the game in their next patch. CDPR is probably one of the best game developers out there today and as amazing as The Witcher 3 is now, i have no doubt in my mind that they will further improve upon it in the future. That's just the kind of developers that they are.  Now to end it off, here is a little about myself and why i can't get the game myself:  I'm currently a medical student in my 20's. In my down time i love to play video games and play on violin. I've been gaming for pretty much my entire life, whether it was the Nintendo 64, PS2 or now the PC, i've always been an avid gamer.  I also often volunteer and help entertain (whether its through playing music, videos or games) the young and old patients staying at my local hospital. Other than that i'm a pretty ordinary person. For me gaming is more than just a way to relax, gaming is a sort of escape from reality, from responsibilities, from hardships. I can always count on video games to be there for me, whether its the world of tamriel in Skyrim, Hong Kong in Sleeping Dogs or Gotham in the Arkham games, i always have somewhere to go.  One of the main reasons i haven't gotten the Witcher 3 myself yet is because of the exorbitant costs of my tuition for med school. Room and board, and food alone are enough to bleed me dry throughout the year, even with a part time job. I would honestly have gotten this game for myself if it had gone on sale for less than 30$ but thats obviously not gonna happen anytime soon (and rightfully so, with the amount of content in this game, 60$ is a pretty good deal) and thats why i would be ecstatic to win it here.  Thanks again for the giveaway!"
GiftofGames,3curoo,Ragequitr2,3,Sun Jul 12 06:00:41 2015 UTC,"I would like to request GTA V for PC. Here's my Steam ID. GTA V is one of the few games that I can never get tired of. I've requested this game a few times before, but even if I don't get it, it still entertains me to write these because I cannot get over this game. Just to be clear, I already have this game on PS3, but not on PC. I'm not sure if that disqualifies me or not, but either way, I'm still gonna keep writing these. That's because this game is worth more than a couple words, and Im gonna make sure that I make it worth it for whoever eventually gifts it to me (hopefully).   This game came out on PS3 and X360 on September 17, 2013. My birthday is 5 days after that, and of course, it was one of the gifts I got that year. Usually my parents got me 20$ and a trip to Steak N Shake (My favorite restaurant), but that year they surprised me with GTA V and a brand new TV (and a trip to Steak n Shake). I know that this story sounds unnecessary, but I want to give you a better understanding of why I like this game so much. It was one of the best birthdays I've ever had, and I will never forget it. Every Time I see something on 9/17, Im like ""oh that's when GTA V came out"" because I'll always remember it. I have so many emotional connections to this game that I will never forget it. This is the only game I can say that I have emotional ties to. Sure, other games make me sad or happy, or make me satisfied with their stories, but none of them have made me truly happy for a whole week or month after. But thats not the only reason this game will forever remain in my heart.   This game is one of the few that gives you full freedom of what you want to do. For me, I prefer games that let you do anything over games that force you upon a single path to an objective. And then after completing your mission, in any fashion you so choose, might I add, you're free to explore the world of San Andreas. San Andreas is huge, bigger than all GTA maps combined. And I'm pretty sure I've explored all of it at this point (excluding the underwater areas). Taking a drive through the desert and the country side is just as satisfying as going out and driving in real life, with the added bonus of not having to pay for gas. If I want to listen to a podcast, I always have to boot up GTA V and drive around while listening, or I get bored. I love taking in the scenery of the world, even if I've seen it a couple hundred times. The possibilities in this game are endless. You cannot run out of things to do. And after 800 hours into the PS3 version, I assure you that that is a fact. If it wasn't, I wouldn't still be playing to this day.   GTA Online is a majority of where I've spent my time. 700 of my 800 hours were spent online. It's pretty much like an MMORPG. You can run around doing missions for your contacts to get money, or stay in the lobby and hang out with your friends. And with the money you've earned, you can buy cars and apartments to show off your riches. And with the cars you've bought, you can use them to race and earn even more money. I also have a group in which me roleplay within the game. Some people RP as cops, others are gangsters, others are civilians, etc. There are so many things to and has taken many many hours from me. And I don't plan on stopping until the servers die. The thing is, if I can get it on PC, Im sure that there will be community hosted servers one day.   Another reason I want this game on PC were explained above, but there are also other reasons. The newer versions of GTA V have features that old gen GTA V doesn't have. For example:  -Next gen exclusive DLC cars and weapons (which are all free) such as the Duke O' death armored car, the air/land/sea Dodo bird airplane, and the rail gun.  -First person. You can enter first person on the next gen versions, which you can't do on PS3/ XB360. Side note- I liked to roleplay in GTA V, so this can really make things more realistic which is important in RP.   -30 player online lobbies. I'm mostly excited for this because of my association with Roleplay and stuff. 16 players really wasn't enough for us since our factions were too spread out on the map. 30 players is definitely enough.  -A brand new addition to the GTA: V story mode following one of the main characters, Micheal.  Not only that, I'm also excited for hardware related upgrades like:  -60 FPS  -1080P  -Game mods. Game mods can really make the game even better. This is confirmed with games like Skyrim and Fallout. I've seen a few mods for this game- and let me tell you, it really makes me want this game even more.  -Better textures and graphics. They were already mid blowing on PS3. I can only imagine what it will look like for me on my PC.  I've had so many experiences in GTA V, and most were great. I've made many friends, and will continue to do so. I have a lot of friends who play GTA V on PC, and I would love the chance to play with them. I'll be able to migrate my PS3 profile to PC, so I will just continue where I've left off. And I assure you, I will continue playing this game for as long as I can.   So as you can see above, I'm completely passionate about this game. I don't mind if I don't win. It wasted 30 minutes writing this request, but it doesn't matter. Like I said, no amount of words can explain My experiences with GTA V. But you can be damned sure I will keep writing until I get it eventually. Here are links to some of my previous requests for GTA V:  https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3b0rzm/offer_steam_the_top_game_on_your_wishlist/cshzdlh  https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/31g0rc/offer_once_again_grand_theft_auto_v/cq1evyd  https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/2zqu7j/offersteamdigitalwww_weekend_giveaway_any_game/cplnliy  Well, so ends my request. Thank you to Azure, thank you for giving people an opportunity, and good like to others who entered. Hopefully this'll be my last attempt, but I do not mind writing more if I am given the opportunity.   Here is GTA V on steam"
GiftofGames,3curoo,FusRoeDah,3,Sun Jul 12 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"Edit: I actually went and created my first serious [Request] thread with a little added content! Link!  Hello there people!  As some of you know, I'm a 22 year old finnish gamer and a student/ bartender. Here's my SteamID just in case!  I've had some misfortune like one month ago or so, in form of my loyal headsets departure to happy hunting grounds. (I hope this is how the idiom goes in english) Good night Sweet Prince. So, as most of you have already guessed, this is going to be a different kind of request, not for a game but for a headset instead. If  it's not fit for this thread, I'm thinking of making my own request post at some point! :)  I'm going to start out  by saying I moved to a different town from my hometown in Finland 2 years back with my ex-girlfriend (we made like 4 months living together before breakup :d I was having doubts about it before the moving tbh, but Tampere is the city I wanna live in anycase!) and I started in a new line of study in here! I was studying business until last december or so, before finally giving up on the school. I applied for english language program in the local university here, we'll see how that goes.   The point of the whole story about moving was that I left my friends and family behind mostly (Tampere is over 400km or around 250 miles from Oulu, the city I used to live in.) I've made a couple good friends in Tampere, and I already had one here, but mostly my interaction with friends is online, which in turn shouts for a working headset. I'm an ex- and hopefully soon to be MMORPG player (I'm currently waiting for an MMO to land in EU) and I still keep in touch and play other games with my former guildmates. I recently heard the guild I created and left off in TERA EU was the 2nd largest before they quit in protest of Gameforges decisions. Buuuuuut that's a story for another time.  Currently I'm using this (Microsoft Lifecam mdl xxidk) as a microphone, and the people who have played Borderlands with me (Doc, Wedge, Mini and Bews too iirc) can probably honestly vouch for me that the sound quality is horrible, and not quite fit for online gaming.  Adding to the request itself, I'm not after some siberias or anything mainstream and superexpensive. Amazon has quite a few options, such as these or these. Kindly take into account that I'm willing to receive used and working headsets as well, no problem with that! Global shipping should be taken into account when dealing with amazon though, since they tend to exclude my country sometimes! International sites rarely have any problems, such as dx and ebay etc. Fair thickness of the cord would be appreciated, since weak cord is what's caused my last two headsets demise apparently. Pictures or proof from my current broken headset can be delivered if necessary. Last but not least, thank you /u/AakashiMasani for the great chance and the work you do for GoG community :)  Sincerely,  FusRoeDah"

If you do decide to go with my post, here are some further discount codes for gmg  [REQUEST][STEAM]Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited  Elder Scrolls Online  My Steam Profile  First of all I'd like to thank you and all other gifters for doing these giveaways. Putting down any amount of money just to improve the life of some stranger on the internet says a lot about your and others who partake in gifting's character, and I just want you to know how happy you will make somebody in 48 hours. I have only ever gifted XBOX Live codes, which isn't much considering I got them for free when I used to game on my XBOX, but seeing somebody else appreciate something that I barely gave a second thought to really made me happy for that day, and I'm sure whoever wins this will be happy too!--I sure was when I won a random number giveaway.  Also, thanks to the moderators/creators of this sub for bringing much joy to gamers around the world.   I'll start this request on a little background on myself. I am a PC Gamer whose entire gaming experience has been the dependent on the kindness of others: my income is severely limited (read: nonexistent) due not only to the cost of college but also due to my near inability to get a decent job (although I go to school in the States, the country that I spend all of summer in when I would work a job is my homeland of Kosovo--a place where there is 75% youth unemployment and where an average wage of 300 Euros a month is considered good--where finding a job is pretty damn hard.) I play on a $170 dollar extra-budget PC (gtx 650, intel G3280, 8gb RAM) that was only made possible through the selling of my XBOX 360 and all games, meticulous sales-browsing on the internet for over a month and the supreme kindness of two of my good childhood friends who donated their time and barely used case and gtx650 to me as well as teaching me how to build and helping me actually construct my PC; without them, none of my PC gaming would be happening, and the hundreds of hours I've spent on Steam would never have happened. I haven't bought a game myself since a 75% off sale of Rome II: Total War in November of last year, and 72 of the 90 or so games in my library are the result of sharing accounts with the aforementioned childhood friends. Although this probably makes me sound like some beggar, I just wanted to write this paragraph to show that I'm not some rich punk begging for a potentially $60 game on the internet; I would prefer if you ignored it actually for the rest of my request because it is the meat-and-potatoes of why I actually want the game, and I would prefer to be gifted due to writing a hopefully good request instead of a lament on my current socio-economic status.  I also should give some background on the Elder Scrolls series and my love for Morrowind and Skyrim as well as the lore and the modding community to which I have contributed. I feel like these paragraphs, slightly modified from my first request for the awesome game that is the Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, which I feel are a pretty succinct description of my affair with the series.  In terms of single-player RPGs, I really shouldn't have to tell you that my favorites are two of the Elder Scrolls Titles--Morrowind and Skyrim. Morrowind was and is a magickal (spelling-intended) place; political, cultural, and religious conflicts throughout Vvardenfell like the feuds between the Great Houses, the tenuous control of the Septim Empire and its puppet monarchy and dukes over the Dunmer people, the ostracization of the Ashlanders, the persecution of non-Imperial faiths by the Tribunal Temple (especially the persecution of the dissident priests), the tensions between Imperial colonizers and the Skaal/Dunmer, the Dunmeri practice of ancestor worship and slavery that even included the IRL equivalent of ""White Man's Burden"" in the Velothi treatment of the Khajiit and Argonians, the economic monopolization and mercantilism of the Empire and her guilds provided for a believable world despite the giant insects as transport, huge mushrooms, volcanic foyadas, strange wildlife and lush swampy jungles of this fantasy island; To say I got absorbed on my first playthrough on the OG Xbox would've been an understatement.   Playing Morrowind also got me into Elder Scrolls Lore like nothing else. When I first read The Dragon Break Reexamined my mind was utterly blown away; here is a book discounting the idea that the Time Dragon could be broken, yet the very presence of that book written in the 4th Era that casually mentions the fall of the Septim Dynasty IN A GAME TAKING PLACE IN 3E WHEN THOSE EMPERORS ARE STILL AROUND establishes Dragon Breaks as a fact. And the 36 lessons of Vivec... yeah, I never thought I would want to know the tale of the hermaphrodotic lover of Nerevar who ended up betraying him, marrying and procreating with the God of Rape, learning the truth of the universe's nature as nothing more than the dream of the unconscious Anu, and going on all sorts of hard-to-interpret metaphysically-themed adventures that may or may not have involved plenty of spear-biting and milk fingers! The mundane lore was also great. Jungle Romans? Check. Cat People created by the Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk to maintain the moons, who could range in form from massive sabre-tooth tiger-sized Senche to the size of a small house-cat? Check. A Reptilian race crafted by a group of dimension-travelling sentient alien trees? Sounds pretty cool to me. It was foreign yet familiar, alien yet close to home. I made sure to read every book I could find on and off the web, and the UESP was a godsend. In fact, my love for the lore has only gotten stronger; I've got the Imperial Library and /r/teslore bookmarked, and I have contributed Apocrypha to the latter on my own time. I even am a part of the dev team for Elder Kings, a mod that combines Elder Scrolls lore with the Crusader Kings II engine to bring Tamriel into the world of Grand Strategy (I also mod /r/ElderKings, so come check us out if you want to learn more as well as the Paradox Plaza forums!) I love Morrowind even more now that I'm on PC: Tamriel Rebuilt adds so much content to the game, Morrowind Code Patch fixes so many annoying bugs, and Morrowind Overhaul has allowed me to experience my favorite childhood game in glorious HD textures much to the chagrin of my low-end PC's graphical capabilities."
GiftofGames,3curoo,Vermax,3,Sun Jul 12 14:27:04 2015 UTC,"I also loved Morrowind's gameplay. One had to actually use the journal and talk to people to get directions in order to progress with quests as there was no quest marker doing all the exploration for you, and as such I not only felt more immersed in the world but also I felt a greater sense of accomplishment in finishing quests. Morrowind also had the best spell and enchant system out of the latter three games, with spellcrafting providing a near infinite amount of creatable spells and being able to put just about every effect imaginable on an enchanted item so long as one had the skills necessary. The stats system in combination with the unleveled world also gave a sense of accomplishment; the enemies were as strong as they would always be, whilst your character would only get stronger and thus feel like he/she has actually progressed in the world as they progress with the quests and exploration within it. I even liked the clunky tabletop melee combat because, once again, it was tied into one's stats as well as one's stamina; when you reached that 60-70 skill rating and pretty much stopped missing hits on those random kagoutis, guar and f'ing cliff racers, you knew you had managed to grow in the game. Also, the opinion of the natives of you starts out small, but through joining their factions, doing quests for them, maybe a little bribery or persuasion or two, and finally through saving the world by the end everybody loves you. From zero to hero, from prisoner to the savior of Morrowind and perhaps the world from enslavement and Ur's false metaphysical preachings (as well as his attempt of recreating Big Stompy *shudders*), you know your character has grown throughout the game and can feel it too in both the combat and dialogue. This game was a 10/10 easy.  Oblivion was a fun game on console, but a real disappointment compared to Morrowind for me. No jungle Romans? Blasphemy. Nibenay was supposed to be the home of a thousand cults, yet all I see are temples to the nine everywhere in what should be a very cosmopolitan and religiously diverse Empire. Skyrim, however, more than made up for Oblivion to me. I had a blast on both console and PC, and I loved all the new lore that was added to the Nords and Falmer, especially stuff that was briefly mentioned in previous games or OOG texts that was confirmed (Giants and painted cows, Alduin and Dragons as shards of the greater Time Dragon AKA, Tsun and Sovngarde, the Dragon Cult pretty much being the Atmoran totemist animist religion (why do you think that each Nord tomb had those same symbols of the dragon, fox, snake, whale, hawk etc. that just happened to match up with Alduin, Ysmir, Shor, Tsun, Kyne etc.), the Falmer still existing but having been poisoned and enslaved by the Dwemer, and of course the return to Solstheim and all the lore surrounding the post-Red Year Dunmer who had suffered so much since the glory days of Morrowind. That's not even getting into the game having decent melee combat and stealth combat for once, as well as the neatness of the thu'um in general and the game's INSANE modability. If there is one game that justified my switch to PC, it's this one, no questions about it; modded Skyrim with Requiem, Frostfall, Morrowloot, Wet and Cold, iNeed, better book covers and libraries... I really should stop giving you all my mod list, but needless to say that Skyrim allows you to tailor that game to be the exact RPG you want it to be using mods in the Elder Scrolls Universe. I was able to mod my game to be more difficult than Morrowind and have Morrowind-esque loot system, I was able to mod my game to include more lore books, I was able to mod my game to unscale enemies and force me to eat, sleep, drink and maintain my character's internal body pressure as well as to skip the repetitiveness of Helgen. The one thing I really don't like about Skyrim is the magic system, the lack of flying whales that expel cocaine, the lack of wasabi (Nord's love it and line their shields with it so they can both taste and feel the heat of battle) and the absence of the true Nordic Pantheon and its replacement with the boring Alessian compromise; luckily, the magic system can be fixed with mods and the lore stuff is still present in previous game and OOG lore. Overall Skyrim, like Morrowind, was and is legendary, and those two games are some of my favorites of all time.  Like with any product I have interest in, I have done my research on Elder Scrolls Online. I have read in-game books through the Imperial Library, talked to people who have owned the game, watched PVP videos from Deltia's Gaming and [SypherPK](https://www.youtube.com/user/SypherPK, and done my fair share of lurking on /r/ElderScrollsOnline to learn about the general state of the game from mechanics to lore and more. What I've seen impresses me to say the least, and for ease of reading I have decided to divide what I like about the game into categorical paragraphs below.     GAMEPLAY ESO gameplay, a combination of improved Skyrim mechanics and your typical MMO ability bar, really intrigues me and seems like a good way to bring the series to the MMO format. Melee combat in ESO seems like an improved version of Skyrim's: one has their standard heavy and light attack, as well as the capability to block. However, ESO introduces a new melee ability: dodge. Simply by double-tapping wasd in the direction of one's choice, one's character will perform a dodge-roll. Although this might seem not much, the dodge-roll is incredibly important in-game PVP, which is one of my biggest draws to the MMO genre: dodge-rolling breaks certain enemy abilities including cc's and thus is critical to just about every build. Because it takes a lot of stamina, dodge-rolling adds to the importance of a stat that in Skyrim was basically nothing but a ""lol look at how many times I can power attack"" bar, whilst now it also is a key to defence (blocking also takes away stamina, and it to is crucial for survivability.) The net result? The increase in importance of the least important of the attribute bars in Skyrim--specifically it's magnitude and regeneration--and thus an increase in the overall depth of melee combat."
GiftofGames,3curoo,Vermax,2,Sun Jul 12 14:30:39 2015 UTC,oops double post
GiftofGames,3curoo,Vermax,2,Sun Jul 12 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"ESO also adds an Elder Scrolls twist on the standard MMO ability bar. Everyone knows about the ability bar: it's where you got your hotkeyed abilities that draw from some resource pool (whether mana or something else, or maybe even not) based on what class one picks. In ESO, your ability bar comes not only from your class but also potentially from the weapon you have equipped, the completion of certain questlines and your status as a vampire/werewolf. Like in some other MMO's (GW2 comes to mind) you've got the potential for weapon choice to affect the abilities you can use; in ESO, one can put abilities on their bar that depend on the use of a specific weapon type, whether it be sword and board, destruction/restoration staff, dual-wield or two-hander. Your choice to become a vampire/werewolf also opens up new passives/abilities along that skill line that you can put on your ability bar, such as (ofc) the werewolf transformation and its pack abilities and the vampiric ability to turn into a mist form for a quick escape in PVP. Finally--and this is what I really like--completion of certain quests and guilds grants abilities that can be put into the bar as well; the Mage's Guild gives some nice magicka-based resource-management abilities, whilst the Fighter's Guild gives some unique DPS options, especially against the undead--even completing the main quest offers a skill line, which incentivizes one to actually finish the game's story (which I've heard is awesome, more on that later.) One also can quick-swap between two bars right in the middle of combat, opening up the possibility of having two ability bars that draw from the aforementioned variety of sources that compliment each other well within a build. Did I mention that ESO also allows one to choose various passive buffs, that also are derived from one's use of weaponry/class/completed quests/status as vamp or werewolf? All-in-all, ESO offers a lot of ways that one can customize their ability bars and passives, providing for a near-infinite number of different builds that one can create throughout their playthroughs of the game.  ESO's greatest strength as an MMO however is player freedom. Although the game has four classes, each and every class can fill the roles of the PVP holy trinity of DPS, Healer and Tank, and thus one isn't limited to one role simply based on some random box they tick at the beginning of the game. Skill lines for the hotkey bar are also upgraded through use, and not just some arbitrary level up mechanic; if you use sword and board, you'll gain sword and board skills. If you discover you don't like sword and board, then just switch to something else--say destruction staff--and you'll start leveling up that! Likewise, dislike the way your character has specialized in-game in terms of how you've chosen to upgrade your abilities? Well you're not stuck, because for a small fee of in-game and easy to acquire gold you can respec. ESO also has a very thorough crafting and enchanting system that allows one to tailor-craft their characters and builds with the passives that they want. With the ability to both create a near-infinite number of builds as well as the ability for all classes to play all roles and the ability to change a build rapidly in-game, ESO provides a unique freedom in the MMO world reminiscent of its origins in the Elder Scrolls franchise.  Finally, ESO has the best third-person mode of any Elder Scrolls game, which is pretty damn critical in MMOs of its type. As someone who greatly enjoys switching from third-person to first-person in Skyrim and even in Morrowind (despite those hideous animations haha) as well as someone planning to PVP should I get the game, this fact is pretty important to me.  Graphics and UI mod support ESO has parts of each province of Tamriel in it, and as such contains a huge variety of zones with varying cultures, architectural styles, flora and fauna that provide a unique aesthetic to every zone. Aesthetics are the most important part of a game's graphics to me, especially with my lower-end PC, and it's good to know that ESO provides such a gorgeous world that is still optimized-enough to run on even laptop gpus. Good graphics aren't necessary for a good game, but they sure help!  Story and Lore ESO takes place during the Interregnum, a period of history between the fall of the Akaviri Potentates and their rule over the Second Empire--arguably the Golden Age of Tamriel--and the creation of the Third Empire at the hands of Hjalti Early-Beard, Zurin Arctus and Wulfharth the Ash-King--the three men whose actions would be rewritten into history as those of one, Tiber Septim. There is no Empire to speak of besides a rump state in Cyrodiil, and three factions--the Aldmeri Dominion, the Ebonheart Pact and the Daggerfall Covenant--battle it out over control of Ald Cyrod. The Aldmeri Dominion, led by Queen Ayrenn (who may or may not be a mining robot from the future who has decided to take revenge on men due to the acts of Ys-Gra-Mor in imprisoning her at Saarthal), is composed of an alliance of the Altmer, Bosmer and Khajiit that seek to install an elven ruler over Tamriel. The Daggerfall Covenant, led by King Emeric--whose coronation owes itself to the Knaheten Flu wiping out the former ruling dynasty of Wayrest, leads an alliance of petty states including Daggerfall, Wayrest, Sentinel and Orsinium in their attempt to restore an Empire in Cyrodiil such that the trade and wealth that once flowed through he Illiac Bay will return; this faction is made up of the Orsimer, Bretons and Yoku. Finally, there is the Ebonheart Pact, made up of an alliance between the High King of Skyrim, the Tribune rulers of Morrowind, and the Argonians of Black Marsh. Although these peoples have a history of fighting one another, they have been brought together out of necessity in order to fight off a Kamali invasion from the East, and now too are invading Cyrodiil in what seems to be less ambition and more a desire to prevent the other factions from becoming too powerful. In the backdrop of this three-way war over Cyrod, the Daedric Prince of Domination and Rape Molag Bol has begun invading Tamriel after the events of the Soulburst, where the Amulet of Kings was manipulated into allowing Bol to open up portals through which he could lead his armies. One's character will playthrough all of the faction questlines as well as the main quest throughout the game, in a story that I've been told is one of the best for an MMO out there; a story good enough that many people have only played this game as a single player for the story alone, never diving into PVP. I certainly want to experience this story for myself, and have avoided watching quest missions for the very reason of not spoiling myself (PVP is also more fun to watch anyways.)  By now, you should notice that I like Elder Scrolls Lore. No really, I do. And guess what? ESO is said to have more of it than any game since Morrowind. It has more in-game books than in any other Elder Scrolls game--2293 books in total--as well as a writing team that really knows their stuff includes dedicated lore master Lawrence Schick (who happens to be awesome too. Here's a list of some of the awesome lore I've read about: 1) the Argonians play a native sport that is very similar to Ōllamaliztli 2) the oceans of Nirn are actually Memory, which fits well with the theory Yoku as a memory of the past Amaranth and Tsaesci as a memory of the future Amaranth 3) More tower lore in the form of White-Gold being theorized to have an effect on Ald Cyrod's landscape   The game is also supposed to have incredible voice acting, far better than Skyrim's. As a fan of voice acting and the character it brings to certain NPCs, this is pretty exciting--especially since many more NPCs have unique voices in this game compared to Skyrim."
GiftofGames,3curoo,Vermax,3,Sun Jul 12 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"PVP and Guilds I am familiarish with MMOs, and something I have always wanted to get into is PVP. Playing against enemies that aren't total idiots held back by AI that can never be perfect--enemies that can actually provide a challenge and will kill you--on an even playing field no less? Sign me up. ESO takes place in an all-out war between three factions, and the PVP is reflective of this; in Cyrodiil, the contested province, the three factions square off in fierce fighting where one can engage with players of the other two factions throughout the province. Along with these player on player skirmishes, there are fights over large fortresses scattered throughout Cyrodiil involving siege weaponry and faction guard NPCs, with the taking of these forts being a huge boon to the taker and a huge loss for the loser. Should six forts be taken, a faction's most active PVP player in terms of points will be crowned Emperor and gain some massively powerful bonuses to help their faction in PVP, although the title usually doesn't last long as there is constant fighting for the fortresses. Besides the fortresses, there are other objectives to take like towns and mines reflective of the nature of PVP as an extension of an in-lore war. Overall, the setting of PVP really interests me, as does the taking of these outposts, and should I receive the game I know I will try to PVP.  This game is an MMO, and as such there will be interactions with other players. I have been waiting for a long time to game with other people in Tamriel, and with the plethora of guilds available for trading, PVP or even roleplaying I am sure to find a community that I will fit right into. As somebody who often tries to roleplay in Morrowind and Skyrim, I definitely want to take the opportunity to roleplay with a guild as I believe that roleplaying brings out the most fun in lore-rich universes, especially if one can do so with others! I have also heard that ESO has one of the best MMO communities out there on PC, and in a world where online PC gaming communities for big games are often toxic it's refreshing to find a game where one can expect to be respected and treated kindly.  Conclusion I want the Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited because the game fundamentally appeals to me as not only an extension of the wonderful lore of the Elder Scrolls Series but also as a game with a unique fusion of Skyrim and MMO mechanics, a game with what looks to be awesome PVP, a game that looks visually stunning, and finally an MMO with what looks to be a great story. Thanks for reading my post, and I hope that all of you have a wonderful summer!  Also, OP, if you do end up granting my request, I'd recommend maybe looking at other websites through which you can purchase a key. The game is $60 on Steam, but can be found on other key-selling sites like Kinguin for lower prices. I know Kinguin may look like a boogie scam site, but it along with g2a have buyer protection programs where for an extra dollar or so they will guarantee a refund if it turns out the game was stolen or hacked from Steam. I know Kinguin also supposedly only deals with reputable dealers according to a fellow PC Gamer I greatly respect, so save yourself a buck that can be used for yourself or to gift other gamers. Once again, thanks for the giveaway!  Edit: the formatting's messed up so I had to remove a lot of the hyphens I used to paragraph-break. Sorry about that  Also included the direct pastebin on the first comment."

GiftofGames,3curoo,Freyaka,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Invisible Inc.  Game Link  Steam ID  Description of Game  Invisible Inc. is a turn-based stealth game made by Klei Entertainment (You might know them for Don't Starve, Mark of the Ninja, and Shank, all of which are excellent indie titles!). You take control of Invisible Inc's agents in the field and infiltrate the world's most dangerous corporations. Stealth, precision, and teamwork are essential in high-stakes, high-profit missions, where every move may cost an agent their life.   Why do I want it  I think I'll love this game because I am a huge fan of  strategy, stealth, and I have this embarrassing childhood fantasy of being a spy.....   Firstly, I love strategy because it forces me to enter a bit of wits, pitting mind against mind. I gives me a thrill, knowing that I have to think my way out of situations, a feeling I love dearly. I have a lot of experience with strategy games, spending a lot of my playing time on them, especially turn based ones like Invisible Inc. I have put over 150+ hours on Civ 5 (Only 27 on my steam account, but ask some of the Civ players I have played with on this sub, they can tell you that there is no way that I have only played under 30 hours, I am too good for that :P). Meanwhile I have actually put over 1000+ hours on the ultimate and original turn-based strategy, Chess. I have dedicated part of my life to that game (hope to reach National Master by the end of the year, woot!). While I am not bored with Chess or Civ 5 yet, I am still looking expand my strategic horizons, mixing strategy with stealth and roleplaying, something I am dying to try as it is so unique!  Now onto why I love stealth.... I love it because, like strategy, it provides a thrill, albeit a slightly different thrill. There is a certain satisfaction in lurking in the shadows, constantly planning your next move. It is like constantly active strategy where there is a constant stream of variables you have to take into consideration to be successful, and I love that! There is a powerful feeling in knowing that you can see everything but no one can see you >:D  And finally, I will explain my love of being a spy :D It stems from the love of the above two points. I had this constant childhood fantasy of infiltrating enemy bases and laboratories to steal secrets. Pulling a heist is a challenge and that is what draws me to it. Imagine setting up all these little things such as diversions and distractions and general trickery and watch them come together to make your plan work. Like rigging an alarm to go off on one side of a base so that causes most of the guard to go there. That would leave 'gaps' for you to slip though. Then you might instead of trying to sneak into the highly guard room where you want to steal plans, you go to the unguarded sleeping quarters instead and steal an outfit allowing to slip past. Then you realize you also need a security card so you would have to dive into a tale of lies, persuasion, and deception to manipulate the 'human side of security'. Putting all of those together to make something work would give me a mind-gasm (similar to when finish coding and debugging a long computer science program, you will understand this if you are a coder), a intense satisfaction of a grand plan with many parts and they all work. Who doesn't love it when everything goes according to plan :)  In addition, there are some other little tidbit that spike my desires. There is amazing art design, really gives off the poetic message of ""beautiful but deadly."" Sorta like Transistor or Shadowrun, both games which I have enjoyed deeply. There is also an amazing and immersive soundtrack. The music itself isn't too great, but in the game it would really set the atmosphere, which is quite important.  But one of the things that made me really interested in this game and caused me to lust after it so much was a review I found. This explains how maps are randomly and intelligently generated for amazing replayability, a variety of environments so you constantly have to adapt to differences and manipulate different variables, as well as a huge focus on stealth which I think it would be very cool to try a stealth turn based game, you would have to plan so far ahead and that is something I love. The challenge of it all is quite exciting. Here is the review in question:  ""Invisible Inc places the player in charge of a futuristic spy agency, fighting against large multi-national corporations. Gameplay is turn based, as you move your agents around office style environments that are divided up into a square grid. Movement distance is limited by Ability Points, and most weapons and gadgets have cooldowns. Its a system that has been growing in popularity over last couple of years, so if you've played games such as Xcom, Shadowrun or Wasteland 2, you'll instantly feel comfortable.  There is more of an emphasis on stealth, rather than direct combat. Ammo for lethal weapons is rare, so most weapons simply knock out guards temporarily. Its best to avoid confrontation for as long as possible. The security alarm increases each turn, and any time you're detected, or you kill a guard, the alarm rises even faster. Higher alarm levels bring more tech online (surveillance cameras, firewalls, drones), and summon more guards. There's always a tough choice between exploring the map for more loot, and getting out fast, before the security level becomes too high.  Mission locations include prisons, where you can rescue an agent (you start with 2 agents, maximum squad size is 4), bank vaults which obviously have lots of cash, finance offices where you can find special key cards to use at bank vaults, manufacturing plants where you can find advanced gadgets (such as cloaking devices and stun grenades), and server farms where you can acquire programs to help you hack and disable security tech. You have limited time to prepare for the final mission, so again there are some tough decisions to be made when prioritising which missions to play.   Maps are randomly generated, which adds a lot of replayability. There's also a form of permadeath. If all your agents die on a mission, its game over. I think any game that combines these two elements needs to be careful with the difficulty balance. Getting screwed over by a particularly evil random map could be frustrating. Thankfully, Invisible Inc seems to have good balance. There are lots of options where you can customise the difficulty level, including allowing the possibility of rewinding a turn to undo a mistake, or even replaying entire missions. And the various gadgets and abilities can help get you out of some really tough situations. Its also worth mentioning that there is no random chance relating to combat. If a weapon is able to hit an enemy, it will hit every time.  Overall, Invisible Inc is a really good game. If you like tactical gameplay you should find alot of enjoyment here.""  I hope I explained myself well and you see me as a suitable candidate. Thanks aak for this amazing offer!  Sadly I must conclude this with a well rehearsed message that might prove distasteful for you, but I cannot help myself in preventing to do so. AAK GIF PLS"

You smash your car into the ball to pass and create goals. I am a soccer/football fanatic. This is my favorite sport and I enjoy it so much. Any game that involves sports, especially soccer/football grabs my attention.  What makes this game even cooler is that it's cross-platform.  PC players will be able to verse PS4 players. This is awesome! I've never played a cross platform game and I would like to try it. It has 9 out of 10 stars on steam. All the user reviews are great and it is a highly recommended game. I hope I can get an opportunity to try this game out.  Here is my profile: https://steamcommunity.com/id/mroklolsorry  Thanks for doing such a giveaway like this."

GiftofGames,3curoo,greasysun,3,Sat Jul 11 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"HI! Steam ID  [Request][Steam]Eldritch  I'd like Eldritch. Rogue games are games that have always interested me. They're randomly generated each time, and can be pretty brutal. They're short in length if you can somehow beat it, but have a ton of replayability. Games such as Fallout, Skyrim, Witcher, great games mind you, can only be played so often. I've played far too much Fallout that I know by memory where all the good weapons and armors are, how to get them, how to complete quests to get the maximum amount of experience points, I even know how to barter my way to the most expensive weapons able to be bought without paying a cap; I've basically become a living Nukapedia.   Rogue games, you just can't become knowledgeable in them. You can know how to deal with certain enemies, maybe how to handle different situations, but you can't memorize the game to exploit it nor become comfortable with it. Eldritch is a rogue-like, sort of like a rogue in that the level design is randomly generated, but death isn't ""permanent"" as actual rogues. You can store money you've earned in a chest for safe keeping before setting off to your untimely demise. One of the most appealing things about this game is that it's based off of H.P. Lovecraft's mythos and stories. He's the Cthulu guy for those that don't really know him. Except Cthulu isn't really the focus of the game. It's based on his works yet steers clear of most of the elements other inspired games have taken. You don't fight the Old Gods or explore the weird places Lovecraft created. Instead, enemies take a frightening note from Lovecraft and scare you with their design and unpredictability rather than mind tricks.   Eldritch plays out like a blend of stealth, action, horror and strategy. From what I can tell, it's about building you up to make you feel larger than life in the first level as enemies take one to two hits before dying. Then the game decides to knock you down, spit in your face and laugh as difficulty is sharply raised. New enemies are presented, some you can't even kill! Stone statues that can one shot you as you walk away from them are a very real threat in Eldritch, thanks Doctor Who. The game seems very fun and amusing, and I'm sure it is. Many say on Steam that its worth the money and is a very fun game to play. I'd like to see it for myself if possible. Also, those damned arms you get to use are glorious damn it.

GiftofGames,3curoo,nomnaut,3,Sat Jul 11 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah yeah I know it's over but there's no harm in mooching right? I haven't been able to use the net for a while cause I was away for the weekends.  [REQUEST][STEAM] Wasteland 2  What up, Superman here (I should really get to bribing you for a flair or something, I mean all the chat guys have something on them)  Ever since /u/funkyrutabaga got me New Vegas, I've been interested in the Fallout series (Yeah yeah yeah, Fallout=/=Wasteland), to the point where I read up most of the lore and often contribute in discussions about it where I have very meager actual experience with the game. Despite all the fancy schmancy interesting lore the series has. My most favorite part of it is the role playing aspect, I can never get tired of waking up in Doc's house and thinking what kind of kooky character I'll play this time (Right now I'm using the Alternate Start Mod and trying to go all the way as a Pacifist Follower of the Apocalypse) thinking outlandish nonsensical character backstories (I once went in as a Ghoul Hating Old Fart who specializes in dynamite and unarmed combat, the mission where you have to team up with the Ghouls was definitely..... interesting, and I had a few run ins with the NCR because of their ghoul members. His backstory is that he and his family are from one of the Vault-Tec Vaults and he meets one of his ancestors whom he takes care of until it went feral and murdered his entire family....) anyway let's get to why I want Wasteland  Wasteland 2 is basically sort of like Fallout, except Turn Based Combat (Yeah, 1 and 2 were turnbased but tbh, I only read about those) and instead of just one, you control a Squad of Wastelanders (or just one depending on you) in which you can customize to a wide extent, that's what really hooked me in when I saw it. Character Creation. Well yeah at first glance it has a pretty lacking ""Character Creation"" but what I'm all about is ""Character"" ""Creation"". There's a limited options in customizing the visual appearance of your character but there's a wide scope in how you can customize their inner workings, to the point where you can craft their own backstories and have it appear on their character info thing.   Combat (Which a lot of people criticize because apparently Turn Based is bad) is actually something I'm really interested in, I grew up playing Final Fantasy Tactics which has a sorta similar working combat system (There's grids, the grids you can move on lights up and you can use the environment to your advantage to get boosts) which I really loved (Mainly because it's like chess, and I like chess. Although I'm terrible at chess) and I like how you can plan out how your squad will be positioned before engaging the enemy (Like maybe have your heavy guy go up front and bomb them then immediately run back while the team covers him)  The setting has been something I've been most fascinated by, mainly because it reminds me of Fallout. There's mutant monsters, desolate wastelands, radioactive pits, makeshift settlements, it just feels right somewhere. It's fun to see how the developers MacGuyvered the technology today to the broken down washed out tools of the tomorrow. Plus, I really liked the world building elements from New Vegas and I'd like to see how the developers made this wasteland work (like in New Vegas, there's caravan routes, all of the towns you visit have their own ways to live off. Goodsprings has their water, Primm is the second rate discount cheapo New Vegas, Novac is sort of like a Tourist Trap which are all powered by the Hoover Dam If it's not obvious enough I really love New Vegas)  Last but not the least, I really like the freedom that they show you in the game, like there's a huge ass map. Go wherever the fuck you want, there's some towns that need help. Maybe help one, maybe help none. That Native American kid is drowning, let's save him, oh wait I'm racist against Native Americans fuck him. Hey look a goat, I hate goats, die goat. Oh you don't like me killing your brethren random village? Well good news, you're next.  Anyway, thank you for doing this giveaway Aak :P hopefully you were somewhat wooed by my request.

GiftofGames,3curoo,Darkeus56,4,Mon Jul 13 03:32:01 2015 UTC,"*[Request][Steam] Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number *  Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number video on steam!  This be mah steam  Alright, so hey Aak! I've seen you around for a pretty long time, since I joined GoG almost a year ago, so it's kind of weird to ask someone specific for a game, and not leave it out there for someone to read it, but here we go! :) PS: what an awesome friend you've got in Azure!   Alright so I'm going to be asking for Hotline Miami 2: Wrong number - so about a year ago, I was still pretty new to video games and steam in general, my first buy was Rust, which I got to play with a couple of friends who lived in my dorm. That became awesome, but with school and work - I wasn't really to interested steam or games. Suddenly, one day during the summer I decided to open up my steam account - smack in the middle of the summer sale.   I decided to just go ahead and buy a few games since they were so cheap, one of them being Hotline Miami - just random, I just decided that it looked like a decent game and at $2.50 why not?   I absolutely loved it. Super fast paced game, loooooooooooved the music and it was just a complete blast I think I passed it all in one sitting - I went and bought a few copies for some friends and I was hooked. On steam, on indie games, on everything and I eventually found this sub which has been nothing, but great to me!   I hate that I don't have much money at the moment, but I do still buy games when their on sale or an extra $1 humble bundle and give it to a friend and save some to do a gradual giveaway here or just one big giveaway (I haven't really decided just yet - I kind of want a theme like everyone else.. but I've been really busy to really think it through.)   Reasons why I want Hotline Miami 2:    I loooooved Hotline Miami  I love the style of the game, and it's music I know that I can just come home after work, sit down after a heavy study session and drown myself in this game.  I keep wanting to buy it, but I'm actually broke right now/ on a tight budget (college student, living on his own for the first time, working and doing summer school) <-- I know you don't really care about that, but I don't know - I think I'm just rambling right now, sorry c:    Anyway, if you can help me out, I'd really appreciate it! If anything else I'd really like it if you'd add me anyway so we can game or just chat whenever, because I always see you doing awesome stuff for this sub and I really do want to become a part of it once everything settles.   Thanks for looking into this bud!   P.S. Hotline Miami 2 is currently $14.99, which I know is a bit pricey for what you're trying to do, but it honestly would mean a lot to me. Anyway, cheeeeers!"

NEVER PAINT A ROOM WHITE. EVER. Or even close to it. It's not worth it.  [Request][Steam] Dex  I'd say my favorite genre of game has to be the platformer, and all iterations therein. From Mario to Metroid to Iga's Castlevanias. From Another World to Flashback and Prince of Persia. A Boy and His Blob. To modern classics like Braid, Limbo, Super Meat Boy, Fez, Thomas was Alone. To recent breakthroughs like Ori and the Blind Forest. To niche hits like Shadow Complex and Abe's Odyssey. To the pc's days of Blackthorne and Three Vikings (names?). I love this damn genre.   At its core, I feel it is the quintessential video game. It conveys everything a game should. From virtual control of an onscreen character, to sights and sounds, to progressing a story (seriously, TOAD did it! He's always there! Don't tell me the princess is in another castle. TELL ME WHICH ONE!).  Dex has become my latest object of desire. It's this side scrolling rpg platformer, with puzzle elements and a female protagonist, all set in a cyberpunk world. It's essentially one of the coolest sounding games I've heard in awhile.  Take a look at the game and while its not a 3D escapade promising the depths of a virtual world like Skyrim or GTA, it's still a detailed, lovingly created environment that begs to be discovered.  I want to figure that game out. I want to know how it plays. The pacing. Who's the villain. Is there a twist? Will it be a struggle throughout or will I become a gravity-toting God on drugs by the end? What will my tool and skill set be? Are there secrets? Are the puzzles hard? Will I need to cheat to progress? How are the animations? Is this a gem in the rough? Why haven't more people discovered this game?  I need to know. Dex  Steam ID"

""much of the content and behavior on the site is either in direct or indirect opposition to [it's new] goals.""    Second: Reddit, under Pao's reign, already made the changes it wanted to attract a wider variety of investors and venture capitalists for their next funding rounds (I bet that was holding them back from more conservative, less internet savvy wealth). Everything thus far has actually been ""How to make your company presentable for investors 101,"" all the way to the chapter titled 'Find a scapegoat, sacrifice them.' Everyone's too busy hanging up the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner to even see the bigger picture right now.   We lost that free speech Alexis used to actually care about. Yeah, the usual response to that is ""But Joseph, the free speech that was shut down was making fun of fat people and others, that's good.

GiftofGames,3ctz87,AkiMatti,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:27:30 2015 UTC,http://steamcommunity.com/id/akimatti  I'd like to see local coop games for pc on a gaming channel.
GiftofGames,3ctz87,AkiMatti,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:08:02 2015 UTC,"Local Co-op is definitely something my best-friend Kaan & I will be doing on our channel. We already have some, actually. Our first video is Gang Beasts. We also have done Towerfall Ascension and Geometry Wars 3.  We're actually asking our viewers to suggest Local co-op games for us to play, we have one suggestion in the pipeline at the moment.  Thanks again for the feedback!"
GiftofGames,3ctz87,AkiMatti,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:21 2015 UTC,how about gauntlet?
GiftofGames,3ctz87,nomnaut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:36:23 2015 UTC,"We played a round of that when it first came out, as fun as it was, I think me and my friend realized after that it was not nearly as fleshed out as we would have liked.. Perhaps we will revisit it though!  Thanks :)"
GiftofGames,3ctz87,nomnaut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:33:30 2015 UTC,I'd be especially interested if Gauntlet would be as good as an action rpg as champions of norrath on ps2. PC rpg games tend to focus on internet coop instead of local coop. I have yet to find a suitable alternative.
GiftofGames,3cu7vw,Panzram1891,3,Fri Jul 10 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"I can't afford to buy you it, if I could I would, I'm in the process of building my own PC myself, but I just wanted to say that I really hope you get it. :)"

GiftofGames,3crmju,likhatjev,2,Fri Jul 10 09:15:54 2015 UTC,You have surprised me with the whole bundle! Are you sure you do not want the other games? As far as I am concerned they are yours. ;/
GiftofGames,3crmju,likhatjev,3,Fri Jul 10 14:37:29 2015 UTC,I already have them. The bundle is all yours :)
GiftofGames,3crmju,makesyoufeeldirty,3,Fri Jul 10 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, I'm glad arga got you. Because the fact that you still wrote this much EVEN WHEN the game goes on sale for cheap, really means that you deserve it.  Good job and enjoy the gift!"
GiftofGames,3crmju,uTukan,2,Fri Jul 10 12:52:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, most people would be willing to write 4 lines about how the game is cheap and they want it to play with their friends. Good job /u/zombies1238 and enjoy the bundle!"

GiftofGames,3cq1bg,DaleGribbIe,2,Thu Jul 9 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"My first PC rpgs were pretty much Baldur's Gate and Planescape. I saw Fallout one day and saw that it too was the isometric, turn based gameplay but was scifi instead of fantasy. I lean more towards scifi in my reading, so it seemed like a pretty good choice.  I enjoyed it a lot. This game had what I had been looking for - the ability to be a bit more tactical in choosing where to target and enough irreverence in the encounters to keep things fun without being annoying. Picked up Fallout 2 a bit later and enjoyed it as well.  Times changed for me shortly afterwards - got married, moved away from ""home"", and then divorced (amicably, and to be completely honest I shouldn't have asked her in the first place - we did better as friends than we did as a couple) over the course of a couple of years. Moved back and am still kinda trying to find my place in the world. Haven't had the chance to play any other Fallout game, but keep wanting to. Keep missing out on it when a sale comes up, mostly due to financial situation.  But I love the setting, I enjoy the stories, and there's just enough silliness to keep it from being a depressing tale of people attempting to survive after the apocalypse has come and gone.

GiftofGames,3cq1bg,stonhinge,2,Thu Jul 9 22:28:08 2015 UTC,There are only four games in the main franchise and there is a decade-long gap between the release of the second and third game. Those that genuinely love the series should have already played New Vegas.
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,FantasyHeaven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 is such an interesting game. What's great about Fallout games, and Bethesda's games in general, is that you aren't on a set path. Yes, you can go on the path the game lays out for you, but in order to fully experience the game you must venture to every nook and crane. I've played Fallout 3 and I love i, but I've always heard New Vegas is better. Thanks for reading.  Steam ID: jaycram"
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,Jaycram,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:57:29 2015 UTC,"Not participating (because I already have this), but I do want to say something.  Fallout is kickass."
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,-wwwpastacom,2,Thu Jul 9 22:16:53 2015 UTC,"I have never played any of the fallout games before, but I got this game recently in the sale because my friend was adamant I'd love it. Before I get to playing New Vegas, do you recommend I wait till the next sale to possibly get the parts that come before?  I had never really heard about the fallout games when I bought New Vegas on the last day of the sale (please don't kill me people), and after that I've heard so much hype about the series that if there's something that shouldn't be missed in the first few games, I don't want to miss it."
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,mikebrown_pelican,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:54:50 2015 UTC,The only Fallout I know anything about that isn't New Vegas is Fallout  3.
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,-wwwpastacom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:33:35 2015 UTC,i loved fallout 3 but never had the opportunity to play new vegas. i really wanted to play vegas before 4 comes out. my friends told me it is awesome! thanks ! if i win i'll be really grateful! i miss playing fallout
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,aggressiveonion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this is one of my favorite games of all time. While I've already played it, it was only on PS3 and without any of the DLC. I did the same thing with Skyrim, then I got a decent laptop, bought it again, and modded it into such a beautiful game. I would absolutely love to play New Vegas with HD mods and the good game overhauls. I'm broke and bored and would be beyond grateful for something to do besides work and making music. I could go on, but I'm on mobile and at work, so I shouldn't. Thank you for the consideration either way. My Steam ID is: steamcommunity.com/id/leedaedalus314   I hope I typed that correctly."
GiftofGames,3cq1bg,Baggabones88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"RenegadeExiled  God, where do I start? I guess I'll preface this by saying I have already played and beaten New Vegas before, on my 360. But, that console died many months ago, and, alas, my days as a Courier of the Wastes was done.  But, why do I love Fallout? Simply put, its a combination of the Lore and how everything presents itself. The graphics aren't best, far from it. The games have bugs, but, their style in showing enemies is fantastic. The Master in Fallout 1 was so horrifically monstrous, yet you could almost understand why it did what it did. All the thought in the lore was great, from the little tidbits of the past, to learning just how twisted Vault-Tec really was. I mean, psychotropic drugs being pumped in, constantly, for one of the Vaults? Nothing but clones for another? A Vault meant to never actually open?  New Vegas itself was fantastic thanks to the variety of guns. I generally make a mad dash to a certain cave for Ratslayer, a unique Varmint Rifle that functions as a baby sniper rifle, then just wander the wastes. It's so easy to get lost, just wandering around and enjoying the game."

I just would love to play this game and I'm sure I am going to enjoy it! Thx for the amazing giveaway!  Steam ID"
