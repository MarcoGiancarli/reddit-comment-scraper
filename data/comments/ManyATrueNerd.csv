I don't remember anymore whether that's actually based on in-game lore or whether I sort of made it up.  But if it is true, it's the only thing that makes any of this make any kind of sense, IMO. Otherwise why not a tear that goes into a world where humans never even evolved? If there are infinite universes, then an infinite number of them must be like that, and an infinite number with no Comstock, and an infinite number where it's just the Howard the Duck planet, etc. That's how infinity works.   Ugh. This game. I love it but it's the kind of love you have for your weird uncle who shows up to Christmas dinner and keeps mumbling to himself about the Illuminati the whole time."

ManyATrueNerd,3dznhf,ThQmas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"The explanation hinted at in game is that there are ""variables and constants""  Some things change, and some stay the same. Of course, there may be a Columbia run by steve, but often Elizabeths tears require similar spaces to move through.   Honestly the train is the most unrealistic bit. And personally, I dont think Booker really cares if the deal holds up. After all, in another world he may have an easier life."
ManyATrueNerd,3dznhf,UsernamIsToo,5,Tue Jul 21 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"When Elizabeth opens the tear to the universe to find Lin, you step into a universe with different literary and plot conventions.  The plots twists make perfect sense to everyone in that universe but you, Jon."

There is even a hook that you can glitch the handyman into getting stuck on in that area if you wanted to abuse it (thats how everyone who ever got the ""kill a handyman by only shooting his heart"" achievement got it btw). They also drop gear, that I'm pretty sure you missed, but sometimes the gear spawns below the map...  edit: Ok, i jumped the gun on you missing the gear... but always check for it.

ManyATrueNerd,3dznhf,abraxo_cleaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:59 2015 UTC,"I think Infinite's plot is pretty daft; but I'm also not sure your criticism of it is totally fair. You're willing to accept the fact that there is a girl who can rip open holes in reality no problem, but then the specifics of it bug you? I mean, the premise is pretty bonkers to begin with, might as well just suspend your disbelief. The plot is handing out super powers, but you're willing to overlook the big things and get snagged on the details. It's like being fine with the fact that Superman can just sort of fly at will, but then being unable to cope with the fact that he can turn while he's flying. Infinite does the same sort of wishy washy hand waving that every supernatural fiction does; Elizabeth even told you earlier in the game that tears ""are a sort of wish fulfillment,"" so really, the fact that she didn't bring you to the universe of Gary clones makes sense.  There are places where the writing acknowledges the universe-hopping (in a part or two Daisy is going to say that Booker died in the universe you're in now which is why she won't deal with you) but overall it does feel like lazy writing, and I agree that the ability to open tears is wildly underutilized; why doesn't Elizabeth just open a tear to the Paris universe and leave you be? Surely it would be easier than continuing to murder her way through Columbia with you."
ManyATrueNerd,3dznhf,ajflanagan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:50:04 2015 UTC,"Well I'm fine with there being parallel universes, and that a girl (who is physically linked between the two because of the finger thing) can influence alternate universes, and pull through items from alternatives, but when you start universe hopping, it goes wrong.  The main issue for me is - when Elizabeth pulls through items, it doesn't matter where they come from. As they're located miles in the air, it's fair to assume they MUST be alternate Columbias.  But when you move into another universe, even if it is wish fulfillment, it still doesn't work, because the context for the story changes - Booker moves universe to get the guns, to get the airship, to take Elizabeth to New York, but he has no reason to believe that in the new universe that there's anybody in New York who wants Elizabeth, or any debt to wipe away... Even if there is, that's the business of the new universe's Booker, who'll be looking for the new universe's Elizabeth..."

Spoiler Warning: ya I get there's like infinite universes where booker is evil, but if there's infinite realities, shouldn't there be like infinite universes where everyone is a super hitler? I feel when the game starts bringing in reality jumping the narrative gets too loose and ridiculous."
ManyATrueNerd,3dznhf,Brothernature0,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"""shouldn't there be like infinite universes where everyone is a super hitler""  No, because as Elizabeth explains at the very end of the game, ""there are constants and variables"", and explains that ""there's always a man, always a lighthouse, etc"". This states that there are infinite universes, but there are all of these constants that remain the same within the alternate universes, while other things are able to exist differently."
ManyATrueNerd,3dznhf,carl1984,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:42 2015 UTC,This is also a good explication as to why booker and Elizabeth aren't concerned with the possibility that they no longer have a deal with Fitzroy. Also the fact that they are in a time period where the ramifications of alternate universes are well known. They just really haven't thought about it too much.

You can deactivate the first sentry bot no problem, and if you're feeling really brave you can fight the second sentry bot.  It's pretty tough for a level 1 or 2 character, but it's doable.  The real annoying part of doing this is not being able to get into the hard locks, of course, you could just grind up to level 3 or 4 before heading into Lonesome Road so you can get the hard locks (which have fairly good loot for that point in the game).  And you get a Dean's Electronics for your troubles, not to mention the repair-per-day from Ed-E.  AND the General's Outfit, which gives you +10 Speech way before you can pick up the Naughty Nightwear.  A good little dip to take, though I wouldn't go further than that.

ManyATrueNerd,3dwmgy,TheButchman101,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree. An intentional shift of verb tense away from the one used in the question carries some implication. If you say, ""What are you doing,"" and I say, ""I was watching MATN,"" the shift from present to past tense implies that you have interrupted me and I'm annoyed. If I say, ""I'm going to watch MATN,"" it sounds like I'm being evasive and avoiding answering your question, or maybe I'm blowing you off. If I ask, ""What have you been doing while I've been away,"" and you say, ""I'm watching MATN,"" my first thought is that you're saying, ""I'm watching MATN right now and don't want to be interrupted by your question. Let's talk after this video is done.""  EDIT: Another example -- If I go into my boss's office and say, ""I've been working on the TPS reports,"" does it imply that I am now done?  Just to check my facts, I did some reading on the present perfect tense, and you're not wrong that, in English, there is often an implication that the action has completed.

Nearly every good let's play I've checked out of either series are different, because the point of most RPGs is to play as a character with a personality different or at least somewhat related, but not entirely the same, to your own IRL personality.  So by those standard, basic rules, can someone, or can the poster him/herself, tell me what is a normal playthrough of, not just Fallout, but most if not all RPGs.

You can tell use this program to mod a lot of games like Skyrim or Fallout.   You will also need the NVSE (New Vegas Script Extender), download first after getting Mod manager. Most of the mods use it. This the NVAC and the 4GB enabler to save your from a lot of headaches.   After that the order isn't a big deal anymore. Mods have to be loaded in a certain order or bugs can occur but mod manager does a good job of doing this on its own. Something to keep in mind, dependiing on the rig and the mods most games do not support more then 120-130 active mods. This sounds like a lot but if you get really into immersion you could download a dozen single mods for a different weapons you like instead of one giant mod and it will eventually add up. Good Luck and happy modding shout out to /r/FalloutMods"

ManyATrueNerd,3dnk9q,billmcneal,5,Fri Jul 17 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the creators/writers for the game didn't consider that a player would have advanced a story with a boyfriend before gathering enough clues. I'm pretty sure they had intended the player would be on equal terms with the hunky boyfriends at all times (i.e. all stats, including the ""clue"" stat) instead of prioritizing one stat to advance only one of the specific boyfriend's story.   This game isn't very polished but still very remarkable how deep the stories go. As far as visual novels go, definitely pushing the envelope by taking risks like a rapist boyfriend. But beyond that, the portraits for each character have like eight to nine different faces and five different outfits for each of them?

If you wait there (or save and reload, it's one of the two) the two bodies with the Remnants armor and T-51b armor should appear. Unfortunately a large amount of deathclaws will probably appear around you as well, which can be a problem if you're not really high level.

But, yes, I would imagine that quality should be marginally higher if recording games off PC, especially if I go for more 1080p or 60fps, which I can certainly perform tests into."
ManyATrueNerd,3dflv4,ManyATrueNerd,2,Wed Jul 15 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"I think your PC videos are absolutely fine, brilliant in fact, don't go changing anything there. It's the console recording which I feel look muddy and blurred. Assuming your editing and exporting settings are the same for both then that leaves the recording settings for the elgato as the culprit for decreased fidelity.   I had assumed you were using a lower quality capture setting in the elgato software so as not to have massive files which your computer might struggle to edit? Or possibly even to make sure the software doesn't crash mid recording, it's not the most reliable even on a moderately powerful machine."
ManyATrueNerd,3dflv4,ManyATrueNerd,2,Thu Jul 16 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"Different software entirely - PC uses Fraps (and that's not deemed the best anyway), while the Elgato uses its native Game Capture HD."
ManyATrueNerd,3dflv4,ManyATrueNerd,2,Thu Jul 16 09:26:49 2015 UTC,I know. Your PC recordings using Fraps are better because it's capturing at a higher bit rate than the elgato software is set to. You can change this in the capture settings of the elgato software using a slider.

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,NukaCooler,24,Mon Jul 13 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"Three types of enemies for the most part. Tunnelers, Marked Men, and Deathclaws.  Deathclaws need no introduction - fast and incredibly lethal.   Tunnelers are easier. They're glass cannons with poor PER stats and a deep-seated fear of fire.   Marked Men are the most dangerous, in my opinion. Unlike the other two, they have a wide assortment of weapons, many of them being guns. One or two hits could spell the end of the run - not to say that the other two are less lethal by any means, but Jon will have to be careful to not run into any ambushes without preparation time. There are also special Marked Men with different masks and abilities - one of them near the end will be tricky, as he's cloaked.  After all that, it's just the final boss, who Jon will either have to talk down or fight, and the largest group of Marked Men in the DLC."

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,bdfull3r,10,Tue Jul 14 16:39:02 2015 UTC,He's actually really easy to kill. But he's also really powerful during the true final boss battle.
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Electric999999,3,Sun Jul 12 21:31:33 2015 UTC,It would be poor roleplaying to fight him.
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,InSearchofSnow,2,Sun Jul 12 21:45:44 2015 UTC,ouch that is going to be a hard one.But  i think that he is going to make it since he completed Dead Money. And Dead Money was a real pain in the ass.
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Jethro_McCrazy,3,Sun Jul 12 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"Both of them are pains in the ass and I can't decide which is worse.  I have the utmost faith in Jon, though."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Hamdingers_Cat,3,Sun Jul 12 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"Dead Money is more memorizing timing of the enemies and collar beeping. Lonesome Road is equal parts luck and stealth. He is going to get into gunfights. Some are just unavoidable. Marked men ambushes are part of the main quest on the main path. There are parts where it is impossible to get past without going straight through a group of death claws and others past a group of tunnelers.   Tunnelers are the new enemy for this area there perception is terrible and they had lowish HP but they are really quick and hit really hard. If he aggro tunnelers he needs to back into a corner with the gatling laser.   The marked men are both former legion and ncr so all of there weapons plus rocket launchers, miniguns, anti-material rifles. A couple of them had the blade of the west that Lanius uses in the hoover dam boss battle."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,IAmJacksPokedEye,2,Sun Jul 12 22:19:03 2015 UTC,that aspects combined with the big and open parts from lonesome road. jon is going to have a hard time. How about the length compared to the Dead Money dlc. Are they equally as long?
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Jethro_McCrazy,3,Mon Jul 13 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"There is more to do in lonesome road but a lot of it is optionable and in a no heal run should be avoidaed. The way he is running it, they are comparable as far as time to complete. LR has no mandatory back tracking its all straight forward."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,olib123,2,Mon Jul 13 12:21:17 2015 UTC,"Deadmoney has the environment trying to kill you, but in lonesome road the enemies are far more dangerous."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,ajflanagan,3,Mon Jul 13 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"Lonesome road plays like fallout though. Much more so than dead money. Jon has showed a hundred times that he's great at playing fallout to his advantage, so I wouldn't be surprised if it actually gives him a little less trouble."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Fadman_Loki,6,Sun Jul 12 22:49:30 2015 UTC,You've got to talk to Veronica again after giving her the dress to get the Scribe's Counter.
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Dinosaur802,7,Mon Jul 13 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"Sadly, Vera's Dress won't complete the unmarked quest to give Veronica a dress. She reacts to it the same way as other 'not special' dresses, but it's not apparently what she's looking for. Probably due to the fact that it was added in DLC, similarly to how some other DLC stuff doesn't interact with main game content and vice versa (like the Grunt perk)."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,fuzzyneck24,2,Mon Jul 13 04:28:10 2015 UTC,I don't think he's too worried about it to be honest.

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,DrunkPlatypusGames,22,Sun Jul 12 20:59:44 2015 UTC,And a NV fully upgraded gatling laser with max charge ammo is just lunacy on toast.

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Jethro_McCrazy,6,Sun Jul 12 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"Woohoo, you survived your first bit of LR.  Well, you definitely need to loot more thoroughly: ammo boxes, safes, etc. Every thing that could contain stealthboys. Also you didn't buy medx radx and other stuff..?  That's strange... Also loot every marked man and sell their stuff to get more money and buy more radx and ammo.   Um. The next bit of lonesome road is dangerous, but you still should visit the HQ for the ed-e upgrade, comissary etc and the armory for stuff. Also there is an area with lots of mines and satchel charges there.... ummm east of HQ? I don't remember, tbh. But I bet you know that area well enough.  Good luck with that marked sniper who is using the freaking red  glare while guarding the laser detonator."

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,Martient712,3,Mon Jul 13 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"They should do it anyway.  Jon is an ""influential"" YouTuber (feels weird to type that since I've been around long enough to remember the 10,000 Subscriber Special), and it'd be great marketing/publicity for Bethesda to have him creating content as close to release as possible."

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,womendezuguo,5,Tue Jul 14 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"It's more about the YCS, I think - Holorifle is great, but YCS is stronger and shoots faster."

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,CamMuffin,12,Mon Jul 13 11:25:57 2015 UTC,"I guess Ulysses wouldn't know anything about House - House only really became active after the Courier arrived in Vegas, and Ulysses has been in the Divide since before that point."

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,xGiBbYv,8,Sun Jul 12 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"True, but just because House was doing something, that doesn't mean Ulysses would have any idea I'd end up joining him or helping him - as House himself says, he keeps his hand hidden until the very end. I would guess that Ulysses is still assuming the battle of Hoover Dam will be just like the first - NCR vs Legion. He has no idea about the secret Securitron army waiting to intervene this time..."
ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,EzekielTombs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"If you put on NCR armor, it nullifies your reputation with the NCR and goes to your next highest rep.

ManyATrueNerd,3d1qqb,borisvoll,2,Tue Jul 14 08:49:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's a little wonky as I recall. But there are a few points in the DLC where you can speech check him using just reputation (it'll say like [NCR], [House], or [Legion]). Since this is right before the end-game and he is friendly to the NCR (he did save the president, right?), the game might detect him initially as pro-NCR."
ManyATrueNerd,3d3bnv,Kittenclysm,4,Mon Jul 13 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think it was on Feros, the planet with the Thorian."

ManyATrueNerd,3d0uyh,zotekwins,6,Sun Jul 12 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"I don't really think so. To my mind a spoiler is just that: Something that spoils the experience of play with unwanted foreknowledge of story or gameplay.   There's nothing in this video I can imagine ruining the game, in fact seeing it made me feel a little relieved as it shows some classic style hitman being (very poorly) played.

ManyATrueNerd,3cy22g,ManyATrueNerd,19,Sat Jul 11 20:29:08 2015 UTC,Ok. That's my favourite MATN LP from now on. The Japanese David Lynch on way too many drugs sort of game with MATN commentary. How can someone not like that?
ManyATrueNerd,3cy22g,Domperidone,17,Sat Jul 11 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"This is the best game and the best LP. This is perfection. God this game is just such a lunatic joy to go through, partially because York is an incredibly charming lunatic.  Like he's just so weird in the most charming ways. Which I guess also applies to the game as a whole haha. He's like really, really different from normal protagonists because despite being a complete lunatic he also has a bunch of little tiny human touches that make him seem more...and this going to sound weird, but I think that he somehow feels more realistic than the average AAA game protagonist. And the fact that the dude with a voice in his head who listens to his coffee somehow comes across as human is hilarious.   Because like he listens to his coffee and shouts about biscuits, but he also talks at length about 80s movies and seems to have a genuine personality outside of the main game plot. It's just so bizarrely charming. The gameplay is a mess, the graphics are atrocious, but this game really feels like it was handcrafted with lots of love from the developer and that's just a joy to experience.  Like I don't know if I'm making sense here, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that the game itself feels as odd as York does. This game is like that one friend everybody has who is really odd, makes things slightly annoying at times but is still a really, really good guy."
ManyATrueNerd,3cy22g,Hopeford,8,Sat Jul 11 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's how I feel about this game as well. York is like a super quirky Fox Moulder in his own world and you actually find yourself rooting for him as a character.  Especially because you are Zach and thus kinda responsible for him. I really like how this game breaks the fourth wall and the dialogues are soooo D. Lynch and Kafka and everything.   Never would I've thought anything would beat yolo, especially because I'm a bit fallout crazy, oh boy was I wrong."
ManyATrueNerd,3cy22g,Domperidone,11,Sat Jul 11 22:48:05 2015 UTC,There's even a playlist for those deviants among you who prefer watching things like that - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD8mQ23OcOw&list=PLwH1xJhcXG0fJJATIRnM4MygGsn19QeH2

There are scenes I simply can't wait for, there is so much in store. . . So says Mr. Stewart.  Also to note, York can grow a beard and his suit can get smelly. This game is strangely in depth with things like that."
ManyATrueNerd,3cy22g,DubiousBeak,7,Sat Jul 11 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"What I love is that sometimes the game suddenly develops this, like, meta-awareness of how weird it is, like when York seems to be fully in on the fact that his squirrel key discussion with the police detective is NEXT LEVEL BONKERS. But then at other times, he's blithely shaving his face in the police station kitchen area and that seems totally fine and OK.  For god's sake please continue with this LP, Jon. I have to know what secrets FBI Special Agent Francis ""Just Call Me York"" York Morgan will reveal in his coffee next week."

Just as a side-note, some side missions actually give you some great stuff that will be extremely useful when it comes to staying alive. Also, I'm sure you went back and checked, but if not, ""F"" and ""K"" could be made out in the coffee, although the ""K"" looks a bit off. I am looking forward to seeing more of this from you."

This game is bananas!  And that horrendous voice acting, dear God... Jon, you MUST play this until the end!  EDIT: Siberian Chipmunk? WTF IS GOING ON?!

It's absolutley nuts and the fact that it is a shameless Twin Peaks clone only makes it better.  Additionally, in the hotel room you wake up in, the picture hanging over the bed is a picture of Snoqualmie Falls and the Great Northern Hotel from Twin Peaks.  Also, another strange thing about this game is that certain things seem to be strangely out of scale with the world around them. That bed, for example, is absolutely massive."

ManyATrueNerd,3cxrlo,Azulake,8,Sat Jul 11 18:57:42 2015 UTC,"Stealthboys are marked as random loot for many containers (like a 10% check for every survivalist cache or dean'ssecret stashes  and other containers). F. e. I might find a stealthboy in Victor's shack (which I often do), but that doesn't mean others will find one on their playthrough. On my last playthrough I've found 5 stealthboys in the sierra madre vault. It's pure luck or the lack thereof.  The best way to get endless stealthboys, is to replay the robot compliance test in OWB, you get a stealthboy as a reward. But that's sort of cheaty.  Doesn't matter though, I always find a lot of stealthboys during LR though (10-20). Pretty sure, Jon will find enough stealthboys to survive the dlc."

After going back to earth in my capsule that I had specially made to be free of lead (that stuff is toxic, why would I want to be be surrounded by it???) I drive home in my poorly tuned 1958 pickup truck, in which I will ONLY use fully leaded fuel, that spews wonderful exhaust-scented air into my face through the vents. This is a long drive(almost 5 minutes!!!) so I have time for another couple of packs of my beloved cigarettes. Then I get to my house, which is in the middle of a fracking field, to get some sun-tanning in before it gets dark. I usually eat dinner at this point, which consists of only fried foods sprinkled with silica dust, and wash it down with formaldehyde.

ManyATrueNerd,3cq2d6,Fadman_Loki,3,Fri Jul 10 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"So glad to see you're playing more of this, I got hooked for a bit after watching the first few videos.  Just a couple of tips, 1) The witchdoctors can remove negative traits from characters, it's the only way to get rid of a villager's heartbreak, however I think the dockside recruits are always better and recruiting a water buffalo from the natives is really the best.  2)  The Marbles are really good for trading to natives but any 'civilized' people's don't care for them, that being said since they're so cheap I tend to stock up on them and if I become overburdened then dumping them isn't a big loss.  3) The 'overburdened' thing can be a little wonky, if you drop or use items that aren't crossed in red the game has trouble shifting the extra items over so if you clear space then manually move the 'over' items into your inventory.  4)  Climbing hills give you a great view of the surrounding area so if you're high in sanity it can be worth it to know where you're going, there's actually some pretty clever line of sight working in the game so you can get a glimpse across the grasslands at faraway objects.  5)  When you move you can make multiple way points if you want to avoid going through jungles or near predators, also, I use the space bar to set off on travel or enter locations to avoid the chance of misclicking and sending the party off on a pointless wander.  6) Finally, the combat system, you've already learned to hold onto good dice between rolls but spend some time learning what combinations are useful, swords and shields go great together especially two of one and one of the other, a pistol and a shield or two is good as well, your shotgun with an eye and a hand is really powerful.  You can hover over the dice or the characters to see what their odds of each roll are and when you level your party they'll start to get more and better dice, try to maximize attack and defense and you'll be a big game hunter in no time giving you access to valuable animal pelts and trading items.  Phew, I know you get a lot of 'advice' from us (no help from the peanut gallery) but I want to see Charles Darwin succeed at something in his life."

If I run to the left, there are some broken concrete slabs in an ""A"" shape in the street that have consistently shielded me from damage (but I do have Hit The Deck, which I just typed as ""shit the deck"").

ManyATrueNerd,3cmahz,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Well, according to wiki it has DPS 232.4 with all mods, it's easy to get and it has a very high rate of fire and in my experience is a better energy weapon shotgun equivalent than tri-beam laser rifle. Gatling (especially the, err, special ones) may be better and pulse gun is also good but 1) gatling deal less dmg per shot, so they are not as good against enemies with high DT (sentry bots) and 2) pulse gun is risky to get (unless you already have it but I have to admit that I don't remember).  Or you could use, you know, plasma mines. You just need to put like 5 of them in doors which ED-E has to unlock in the first silo and turn on the turrets and the first few sentry bots should be dealt with with minimal risk. And knowing your obsession with mines I guess you will choose this option. Either way, it may be a good idea to exchange 1-2 gold bars for as many mines as you can, they will surely come in handy."

Here's how it goes:  My friend and I start a new game together and we realize that no matter what name you choose Doc will say, ""Well that's not the name I would have chosen for you, but if that's your name, that's your name.""  This is where we think, hmmph, I wonder what happens if you name your character Doc Mitchell. So naturally, you can't have a character named Doc Mitchell without looking like Doc Mitchell, spent about an hour creating his likeness only to find out he says, ""That's not the name I would have chosen for you, But if that's your name, that's your name.""  Disappointed and defeated, we decided not to just waste the save and had fun with it. Now there are TWO Doc Mitchells in the world, and naturally, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. Since we are the superior Doc Mitchell this imposter has to go.   We then proceed to kill, chop up, and hide him in the bathtub, but wait there's more. What if the citizens of Goodsprings are sick and need a doctor? solution: Kill all of Goodsprings.  After this we head through Primm, do the things, go to Nipton, do the things there too. Up to Novac... WAIT! Doc Mitchell shouldn't be up in Novac, his home is in Goodsprings, Kill all of the Novac residents. We play the game, kill people, grind up the Doc's corpse with a nice chainsaw.  This is my experience with Doc Mitchell playthroughs, mentally scarring, psychopathic rampages, and hella fine sunglasses we got from Boone."

Btw, I didn't want to make a new post for it, but I've completed lonesome road two days ago while taking 14 HP damage (thanks to a marked men ambush), but I was being extremely lucky in this playthrough, using up 3 stealthboys ( I could've used up many more, because I've done a legion playthrough and afterwards found 5 stealthboys inside Sierra Madre Vault, not kidding).   I've used one stealthboy in the cave of abaddon, another in the very beginning of the high road...where the guy with the shoulder mounted machine gun is. And the last one of three near Rawr's cave and that Ralphie poster, where an invisible marked man spawns in.  Tunnelers were utterly annihilated with the unique gatling laser from Van Graffs, Christine's silencer Rifle was my go to weapon, also YCS with max charges microfusion cells for deathclaws. And fully modded Red Glare for marked men groups. Also gatling laser in close quarters (like the HQ, where one of Eddie's upgrades is, I headed there because of the ""free satchel charges"" upgrade), marked men can't even do a thing vs gatling laser.  I've also found 6 stealthboys on my way to Ulysses (and I didn't stray at all, except for HQ and men barracks) and 8 after the final battle with marked men.  Not sure if I was just being extremely lucky, or if Lonesome road is actually survivable, if you know where the enemies spawn.  My biggest problem was the area before Ulysses Temple where three marked men are, one with  a minigun and stealth field, there I had to use Implant GRX.

But new things constantly come up to stop me doing it.  For example, I'm currently interested in watching The Curious Expedition evolve, and doing a run in that per Alpha version. In fact, there's one of those coming next week for Alpha 12.  The week after that - if I can get hold of the Alpha, I want to do some of We Happy Few.  The week after that - I imagine we'll have Life Is Strange Episode 4 by then.  The week after that, Rare Replay will be out, and there are at least 3 games in that I want to give some love to.  See, there's the issue - there's a lot of stuff I COULD do, and FTL, because I've already done so much of it, can't always take priority over new stuff.  I honestly doubt you'll see it in the next month.  But somebody below suggested a live stream - y'know, that's actually interesting. I'll give it some thought."

That's a neat little game, even if it still has some kinks to work out. I suppose that game does scratch the same permadeath rougelike itch as FTL. I also just watched the video for Defect. I think that's a game with real potential too, and it covers the whole space opera aspect pretty well.   It's ok that you probably won't make it back to FTL anytime soon. I just wanted to say how much I loved that series. But, as the FTL series introduced me to a really great game, I expect your other series will probably do the same.

Maybe the return of Evil Jon? Even though 'kill everything' isn't the hardest ruleset to follow in this case,    having Jon return to his comically sociopathic playstyle would still be great fun."
ManyATrueNerd,3ceux9,fullmetal_jack,3,Tue Jul 7 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"I feel that after he finished the base game (magnificently I might add) he'd proved that it was entirely possible to achieve a YOLO run and thus accomplished the primary goal of the exercise.  Once he started the DLC the question of how far he could get was entirely acedemic, now that everything besides Lonesome is finished he's solidified hisd credentials as a fallout expert so it's rather irrelevant whether or not he survives all of the DLC.  At this point there has to be some question of the value of a 'good death' over an inglorious one, we're all anticipating the Primm Plunge to be the cap off of the series but there would be a certain appeal to having a 'big damn hero' moment and dying in combat immediately after the THC bottoms out."
ManyATrueNerd,3ceux9,Sub-Mongoloid,2,Tue Jul 7 12:03:09 2015 UTC,"I do not doubt he can finish the expansion but shit happens. My point is for the time we all have invested it would be a shame to have it cut short. But my suggestion could be wrong, Jon may have a something way more amazing."
ManyATrueNerd,3ceux9,DiscountCleric,2,Tue Jul 7 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"A suggestion I can only make now that Dead Money is finished: If P.D. Shoot dies, Jon starts the Lonesome Road DLC over."
ManyATrueNerd,3ceux9,RealFoxD,2,Tue Jul 7 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"You want Jon to begin again, but if he dies, he's already learned to let go."
ManyATrueNerd,3ceux9,Walkupandout,2,Tue Jul 7 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"I concur, if the true health counter hits zero Jon should keep going. The spirit of the run will have ended but the journey should at least be seen to fruition. I want to see you finish it out Jon. I want to see you try not to nuke the Mohave."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,czokletmuss,13,Mon Jul 6 22:40:11 2015 UTC,"I survived the ride on Elevator to Hell with 0 dmg. All you have to do is to snipe 2 tunnelers who spawn at the beginning (riot shotgun headshot + And Stay Back) and then just activate Stealth Boy and stand where I stood.  Tunnelers will kill ED-E but they should leave you alone. I have to admit however that crouching 1m from tunnelers on a tiny platform while riding through an irradiated and exploding tunnel was nerve-wracking. I can't imagine how stressful this would be in YOLO run. BTW tunnelers seem to die from explosions (?) - I'm not sure whether you can get splash damage from it or not.  But still, it works. I got 0 dmg (the lowered health bar is not healed dmg after encounter with marked men and their anti-material rifles) and I think you can pull this off too, Jon."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Kittenclysm,16,Mon Jul 6 22:42:59 2015 UTC,Nerves of Steel is a perk. Thought for a minute that's what you were talking about.
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,TOHSNBN,2,Mon Jul 6 23:30:15 2015 UTC,Both would be useful ;)
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Kittenclysm,7,Tue Jul 7 09:43:08 2015 UTC,"Building on that, i managed to kill nearly all marked men with single head shots.  Running and hiding after the trigger points works fairly well.  Regarding the Deathclaw on the freeway i was able to safely kill it from a distance without damage but the engine could have been rendering further due to changes in the config since i played a enhanced sniper run."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,TOHSNBN,2,Tue Jul 7 00:34:53 2015 UTC,That sounds insanely hard because of their perfect perception. Props.
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Kittenclysm,3,Tue Jul 7 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i can not remember exactly wich perks i used but i played it like john, counting on criticals with the AMR and drugs, lots of drugs.  But drugs should be ok, keeping a steady supply of phycho/medx or slasher throughout lonesome road is manageable.  John should be high, all the times, popping pills like they are candy!"

ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Domperidone,6,Tue Jul 7 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"It's not nerve wracking if you use turbo/GRX instead of vats, you can kill everything because tunnelers crawl slowly and you shoot fast still. Riot shotgun is bad (not silenced) but can be effective"
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Troggie42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, grx and a silent high dps weapon (sleepytime/12.7/h&h nails tool) if you are using a stealthboy or just high dps if no stealthboy (maybe  gatling laser, but probably not that awesome without the laser commander perk).  Jon should level up medicine for the chemist perk, more oompf from radx, longer duration for steady/medx/psycho and stealthboys. Also buy all the radx, medx and mines (and some weapon repair kits) with the sierra madre chips, also make as many satchel charges as possible.   Oh, and find out the exact time when the grx implant replentishes. That may come in handy for planning out battles.  Stealthboys:    you get stealthboys after repeating the robot compliance test, but thats out of question, because there are roboscorpions even after dealing with mobius. there is one in the medical lab in big empty, but there are 3 robots and the phd one is dangerous."

ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,FinalFate,2,Tue Jul 7 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"About the tunnelers... i am not sure but could you not just run past them?  They only spawn indoors, blocking the way.   Could that be an option?"
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,TOHSNBN,3,Tue Jul 7 10:12:47 2015 UTC,This is a section on an elevator where you're stuck with them in a confined space for a fairly long time.
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,ThQmas,2,Tue Jul 7 10:17:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, indeed, i was referring to the other tunnelers.  I may be wrong but i think they only spawn in the tunnels and the elevator. The ones in the tunnels are evil, quick and sneaky. But if you run past them you might be ok."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Grandpa_Edd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:24:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you might be able to. I know there is one zone where it just spawns hostile Tunnelers all over you."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,ManyATrueNerd,2,Thu Jul 9 18:28:02 2015 UTC,How much unavoidable radiation is there in lonesome road? I might be imagining things but I recall there being a lot.  The first level of rad poisoning lowers your Endurance by one.  Which means that you lose 20 HP and also 5% poison resistance and 2% radiation resistance.  And that's 1/7th of his HP at this point.  Edit: Anyone know what his current radiation poison is?
ManyATrueNerd,3ccv4a,Fadman_Loki,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:38:44 2015 UTC,"I think I got 100-130 rads during whole ""Lonesome Road"" but you can probably get at least 30 rads less than that if you are careful with approaching warheads before and after detonation.  Good question: /u/ManyATrueNerd, how many rads have you accumulated so far?"
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,mattinthecrown,20,Mon Jul 6 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"Luckily, I'll have a chance to get you up to date next week, as we look over the final set of equipment to take in to LR, and what I'll be spending my DM money on..."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,ManyATrueNerd,7,Mon Jul 6 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, you actually get to keep the gold from DM?  I thought all that money would be... dead."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,GoatMarine,9,Mon Jul 6 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Well, you keep what you can carry. The game is supposed to be teaching you that, if you try to take all of it, you'll die. There are ways to abuse to get all the gold, but I don't like exploits. As the game tries to warn you - just Let Go."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,ManyATrueNerd,4,Mon Jul 6 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"I know, I've played it before and actually nabbed most of the gold because I can never let go, but it was a pun.  Becuase the money is dead.  Dead money.  I'll just conk myself on the head with a gold bar, shall I?"

ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,stcman,2,Mon Jul 6 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Another hint - if you don't have the long haul perk used in this video (which lets you fast travel while being overweight), the ""Blue Mountain Transporter (sp?)"" that you get for completing Old World Blues lets you teleport right back to the Sink where there is a shop and storage (so you can slowly sell each gold bar as you need it).   Added bonus - if you're high level enough, the Sink is one of the vendors with the most bottle caps, making it perfect to sell your gold to.    Of course this requires you to do Old World Blues before Dead Money."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,RedditTotalWar,2,Tue Jul 7 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"The Big Mountain Transportalponder! doesn't work between DLC without a mod on the PC version---on the console version, DLC content cannot interact with other DLC content."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,RealFoxD,2,Tue Jul 7 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct. I should've been more clear - my hint was about a convenient way to get the 37 gold bars to storage and sell to a vendor AFTER you've finished dead money. Once you're back in the mojave, the transportalponder works again.   The player in the video had to use long haul to fast travel."
ManyATrueNerd,3ccduq,RedditTotalWar,2,Wed Jul 8 02:36:56 2015 UTC,"Cool.  Just going back and looking at some of the older vids, you'd often go into the barter mode and say you were going to sell things, but not show it.  In episode 7, you sold the space suit because you got the stealth armor, but we have no idea what you actually sold or bought.  You could edit it just so that we see what you sold and bought without necessarily showing the whole process.  It's only boring if we see all the ambivalence such scenarios induce."
ManyATrueNerd,3cc6y5,ManyATrueNerd,8,Mon Jul 6 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"Actually Jon, the gates to the toy shop CAN be opened if you just walk up to them and press the action key. Booker will lift it up manually. Inside there will be a door you can use Shock Jockey on and enter it to find some goodies.  Also, the riddle you said you can't solve inside the restaurant with the dead rebels - the other part of it is inside the barrel of the cannon across the street. You then take that back to the bathroom and move a hat rack to open a secret door. You missed out on a salt/health/shield upgrade vial thingie as a result, I believe."
ManyATrueNerd,3cc6y5,Dinosaur802,8,Mon Jul 6 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"Dear Jon,   Please never take an American history lesson because your mutilated understanding of U.S. culture mixed with British Jingoism is pure comedy gold."
ManyATrueNerd,3cc6y5,Sub-Mongoloid,3,Mon Jul 6 22:14:08 2015 UTC,"Regarding possessing the vending machines, I personally found it invaluable (no pun intended) in 1999 Mode. Sometimes they only spit out a handful of silver eagles, but sometimes you get well over 100. And if you're vigilant about looting, you should rarely have to spend money to buy salts anyway. You need to save your cash for weapons and vigor upgrades!  Btw, don't know if you're looking for advice on later game boss fights or not, but when you fight Lady Comstock, using upgraded Charge + Burning Halo on her is godly and can finish the fight in about ten seconds. It's so OP it almost feels like cheating."
ManyATrueNerd,3cc6y5,DubiousBeak,2,Tue Jul 7 00:56:27 2015 UTC,Also if there is a free salt machine nearby you can do it without worrying at all.
ManyATrueNerd,3cc6y5,Brothernature0,3,Wed Jul 8 00:01:52 2015 UTC,"The possession on vending machines that was mentioned here earlier was specifically about using it on them when the free salt refills were available- if you have infinite salt for a while, might as well snag some eagles. The machines give between 10-100 of them, so if you're lucky, some areas yield as much as 400 eagles and then you just top off on salt for free."

ManyATrueNerd,3ca8az,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:21:51 2015 UTC,"Makes a sort of sense: ""Retard"" was a long used medical term used for many conditions, mental and physical, and became taboo when people with disabilities stopped accepting being branded with what they can't do as opposed to what they can do. ""Spastic"" was the name of a foundation (now ""Scope"") to help the disabled that was adopted as a slur on those very people. It was a proper noun invented to help but used to hurt. It was a much more malicious attack as opposed to a technically accurate, pre-existing term people got sick of being lumbered with."

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,thirdtotheleft,43,Mon Jul 6 11:44:58 2015 UTC,"Just a thought for Lonesome Road.  If you can level up again and get your medicine skill to 60, Chemist will double the duration of your stealth boys and implant GRX. I imagine that both of those will be extremely helpful in surviving lonesome road. Tunnelers also flee fire, so a flamer might be a useful piece of equipment for the elevator of doom."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,RealFoxD,13,Sun Jul 5 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"He'd need to put all of his skill points at level 38 into medicine, as well as getting a medicine skill book. Don't know if he grabbed the one in Novac, so that would be an option."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Holyrapid,8,Sun Jul 5 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"If not the one in Novac, there's one in the Followers Safehouse and one more in HELIOS One, in the initial building where you get the East terminal password (if Ignacio Rivas doesn't give it to you.)  The one in Hell's Motel involves getting past three Feral Ghoul Reavers and taking a significant number of rads; wouldn't recommend it for YOLO."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,RealFoxD,3,Mon Jul 6 02:16:44 2015 UTC,Ignacio gives you a Big Book of Science and not a medicine book.
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,paleoreef103,3,Mon Jul 6 07:28:59 2015 UTC,"That's correct.  I wasn't referring to the skill book but to the terminal password.  The room the password is in contains the DC Journal.  Completing the quest the Ignacio way (sending the power to the full region) nets a BBoS as part of the loot, which makes it arguably the best way to do it depending on whether you feel the ARCHIMEDES II is a useful weapon or a lame gimmick (I tend to fall into the latter camp.)"
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,paleoreef103,8,Mon Jul 6 10:15:04 2015 UTC,That would be Level 40 - Level 38 is for And Stay Back.

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,thirdtotheleft,8,Mon Jul 6 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah stealth boys and turbo are required for a clean lonesome road run, probably need at minimum 5 Stealthboys and 15 doses of turbo/GRX if you count on picking up all the stealthboys (markedmen and ammo containers gave me over 12 stealthboys)  If lonesome road kills Jon, I bet it will be from the red glare rocket barrage scripted event at the start though. So next week pretty much determines whether he makes it or not"

Btw, please get the unique gauss rifle (ycs?), you could oneshot Rawr with this thing, if you wanted to.

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,RealFoxD,14,Mon Jul 6 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"Incredible. This last part was what worried me the most. That part at the end with the elevator and fast beeping radio had me holding my breath in suspense. I actually said ""what the fuck dude"" out loud when you finally got through safely! haha  Best of luck on Lonesome Road. The enemies there can be very tricky and are quite powerful. The Tunnelers for one are a pain in the ass at any level. The flare gun is a nice distraction, but it's really hard to deal with them if there's more than two. The flare gun just doesn't have enough DPS to keep shooting them to scare them off while still doing damage with a second stronger weapon. Using the knockback shotgun perk might be your best bet.  I'm sure you have no plans on doing this - but do NOT go into the Courier's Mile. Even at level 50, that place is an insta-fucking-death area with irradiated deathclaws that 1-shot you, as well as tons of marked men that seemingly have a perception of like 1,000 and I can never sneak past them to enter the area to snoop around first for a surprise attack."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,RealFoxD,6,Sun Jul 5 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"He can't risk any close range combat with tunnelers. They're too fast and damaging. He should save stealthboys for encounters with them.  As soon as you're a few feet into the Courier's Mile, you're at +3 RADS/S, so Jon shouldn't even consider entering the area."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,RealFoxD,5,Sun Jul 5 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If he didn't explore all of old world blues, he doesn't need to explore the Courier's Mile."

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Electric999999,4,Sun Jul 5 22:18:34 2015 UTC,"While Jon is far enough now that I think the risk of death by rads is fairly low, I also think that it is extremely unwise to tempt fate by going into a radioactive deathland for a weapon he won't use.  If the stealth boy is that close though..."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Mrs_Brisby,4,Sun Jul 5 22:59:21 2015 UTC,The problem is that if he does go up to radiation level one it's -1 END which is essentially a 20 HP hit.
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,carl1984,5,Sun Jul 5 23:32:19 2015 UTC,"I've actually tested this; END hits due to effects do not affect max HP, in Fallout 3 or in New Vegas."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,LoverOfLed,2,Mon Jul 6 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"That feels like a glitch to me. I'm honouring it anyway - radiation poisoning hits endurance, and that hits HP."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,NoOneImportant4,3,Mon Jul 6 11:49:20 2015 UTC,"Oh well, it's your funeral.  No known major patch or bugfix mod (including JSawyer, made by the lead developer of New Vegas) changes that element of gameplay, so I'm thinking that works exactly as designed."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Nym990,2,Mon Jul 6 12:41:17 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if I ignore HP loss, and OWB gave me 100% poison resistance, that means that endurance -1 would mean a small reduction in unarmed and survival, and default rad resistance dropping from 18% to 16% - a drop so tiny, it's inconsequential.  That seems woefully too small a penalty for minor radiation sickness..."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,kolboldbard,2,Mon Jul 6 12:44:16 2015 UTC,"A whole-body dose of 200 rad (2.0 Gy) is ultimately something most people walk off if they're unfortunate enough to get irradiated to that degree...hell, Alvin Graves took 400 rads from the same criticality accident that killed Louis Slotin and ended up fathering a healthy child two years later.  In the Fallout universe he might have turned into a Ghoul.  The nature of SPECIAL is such that every penalty the game applies is a minor annoyance until you're dead.  I refer you to your -1 STR penalty on a 1 STR character in the Don't Starve run for a prime example.  Not that it's going to matter overmuch in the grand scheme because you're either going to lose that 145-150 HP in one whack or you won't lose it at all."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Azulake,2,Mon Jul 6 13:43:52 2015 UTC,There are quite a few enemies with rapid fire weapons too - I could take a few knocks from those.

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Squoghunter1492,3,Mon Jul 6 06:09:09 2015 UTC,"Nope - every level of rad poisoning is -1 Endurance, so that's 20 HP lost every time. I need to avoid rads."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,thirdtotheleft,3,Mon Jul 6 11:48:35 2015 UTC,"Tunnelers are easy if Jon is prepared, first area you can just walk through to the end with a stealthboy, the building part is easy with EITHER a turbo or stealthboy, the Queen of abbadon part is pretty simple with turbo and  a 12.7mm SMG with hollowpoint or probably a stealthboy. Flare gun is garbage, riot shotguns are a bad choice unless you use turbo  The most dangerous part is getting the laser detonator at the start, when you come out of cover on that street the rocket trooper spawns and fires within the second. Turbo/GRX and a quick snipe can kill him before he rains missiles all over you but its probably a lot harder on console than pc, wonder how Jon will handle that as he doesn't spawn until you trigger the event and is therefore unable to be sniped from high ground like the rest of LR"

I had a near heart attack when you were GRXing pass the hologram to get to the radio control console, it seemed like you clipped the railing and messed your jump up.

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,fuzzyneck24,11,Sun Jul 5 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that clipping scared me. At that point, it's 50/50 if the game's going to let you jump again, or just drop..."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Palodin,2,Sun Jul 5 22:49:07 2015 UTC,Are you going to power level to level 50 to get as much HP as possible? That seems like the only feasible way for you to have a glimmer of hope for finishing Lonesome Road.
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Syph26,5,Mon Jul 6 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"That would be a fantastically foolish idea.  Right now, it is still possible to do meaningful damage to Divide deathclaws (which have 550 HP from level 30-39) with sneak criticals.  Taking on Lv50 Divide deathclaws, which have 700 HP?  There is no weapon in the game other than the Fat Man which can do that much damage on a non-headshot sneak attack critical at the Hard level of difficulty Jon is playing on.  Plus, more HP won't help too much; Deathclaws are the real threat here, and their damage output scales up faster than gaining HP through leveling up does (62 damage per 10 levels, contrasted to the 50 HP gained.)  Trading the ability to survive an extra hit or two from tunnelers or marked men isn't worth making combat with the deathclaws nigh-on impossible."

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,NoOneImportant4,3,Mon Jul 6 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"That'd be a bad idea, in fact, Jon should aim to stay below level 40, as the enemies in the Divide scale with the player every ten levels, making it a significant amount easier if he doesn't level up."

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,NoOneImportant4,9,Sun Jul 5 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"A piece of advice for Jon: Get the Day Tripper challenge perk by taking 25 addictive substances, it'll increase your Stealth Boys length by 33%. This stacks with the Chemist perk, making Stealth Boys last for 5 whole flipping minutes. If you happen to get addicted, just stock up on Fixer.  EDIT: looking over addictions on the wiki, Whiskey and Scotch only have a 10% chance of addiction, and only give -1 charisma and agility."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Syph26,8,Sun Jul 5 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"Jon could use Cass for a short time to nullify the dangers of whiskey, too."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Kittenclysm,7,Mon Jul 6 09:14:45 2015 UTC,Excellent call - that way I could whisky my way to Day Tripper with zero addiction risk.
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,kutkint,5,Mon Jul 6 11:51:37 2015 UTC,I think Jon would rule that using Fixer counts as healing.
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Drokash,5,Sun Jul 5 23:25:37 2015 UTC,"Fixer isn't a permanent heal, though, and I think I remember a comment he made, ages ago, when people were debating if Buffout should be allowed, that he'd use fixer but I might be misremembering. Even if he does get addicted though, I think it'd still be worth it."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Fadman_Loki,3,Sun Jul 5 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"Fixer is bugged on console and unmodded PC versions, so that it does actually have the net effect of curing addictions permanently.  Whatever it is that's supposed to put the addiction back after Fixer wears off doesn't fire properly; you can actually use Fixer then quickly use an Antivenom and you don't even have to listen to that gods-awful poisoned-Courier effect (the same one as when you get stung by a scorp or a murderbug.)"

ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,forgodandthequeen,14,Sun Jul 5 21:18:34 2015 UTC,Not til I've seen a comparison of the different versions - I want whichever is prettiest and most stable on launch day - and no guarantee that'll be PC given the Arkham Knight fiasco...
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Syph26,16,Sun Jul 5 21:21:38 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it'll be that bad. Arkham Knight was a result of WB farming the PC port out to a studio with no PC experience (Iron Galaxy, you just need to look them up to see why it's a bad idea). Bethesda typically do their PC development in-house and their games are usually pretty good on launch (Or no worse than the console versions with regards to bugs etc). Caution is the best policy but I'm optimistic."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Mercutio879,8,Sun Jul 5 21:54:52 2015 UTC,This is the only acceptable answer. And that's coming from a PC gamer. Always wait for the reviews.
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,RealFoxD,-4,Sun Jul 5 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that.  I've become so disenfranchised with console gaming that I wouldn't even consider getting FO4 on Xbone or PS4 if they were selling it for five bucks...and I mean the console and the game, since I don't have either console."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,Fadman_Loki,7,Sun Jul 5 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of that, though. It's a question of what it's best on. And as Jon already pointed out, sometimes PC gets a butchered version. And as unlikely as a worse PC version from Bethesda is, waiting does no harm and assures you don't get screwed."
ManyATrueNerd,3c87n4,blackcoachjesus,-4,Mon Jul 6 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"If it crashed 95% of the time, I'd still rather play on PC than on a console where it didn't crash at all."

Sneak attack critical easily one-shots them. And their perception isn't spectacular either. There's a good chance I'll see them before they see me.  Tunnellers are 0 DT. Hollow point ammo wrecks them.  Also, plenty of marked men are melee, so And Stay Back makes them a joke.  Deathclaws in LR are tough, but not that bad, and I've dealt with them before.  The enemies are all manageable - the issue is getting swarmed by them.  A blend of sniping what I can, plus abusing GRX & stealth boys as far as I can - LR is possible. I don't think it's impossible. It's unlikely, but, albeit taking the coward's route as far as possible, it CAN be done. Just. Maybe."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,5,Mon Jul 6 09:39:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's certainly manageable---I've beaten LR permadeath, but ""permadeath"" and ""no healing"" are two vastly different things."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,9,Mon Jul 6 10:24:23 2015 UTC,"Basically, I have to not get spotted at all, for the whole DLC."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,5,Mon Jul 6 10:26:01 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to survive one hit from the Marked Men, and possibly a genuine fight against the Tunnelers (who are, as I've mentioned elsewhere, just terrestrial Cazadores; they can't even punch through good-quality armour, and the poison resistance bestowed by Old World Blues blunts their other strength.)  Really, as long as you don't get spotted by a Deathclaw, you can afford to make a mistake.  One mistake, mind, but you don't have to hit every mark bang on."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,4,Mon Jul 6 10:38:30 2015 UTC,"There's also a lot of LR you can straight up skip - like the cluster of enemies just before Ashton, with Bonesaw - just stick to the road (stealth boy not even necessary - just crouch with high sneak) and as long as you have Light Step for the charges, you're fine to skip it.  That happens a few times - fights you can just ignore. It's a bit like OWB in that regard - lots of the toughest stuff you can ignore."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,forgodandthequeen,4,Mon Jul 6 10:48:35 2015 UTC,I'm hoping you make it all the way to Ulysses so the world can find out who you nuke (or whether you'll go to the trouble of rescuing ED-E and being a big damn hero.)

ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,EzekielTombs,2,Mon Jul 6 10:57:08 2015 UTC,That room contains two Sentry Bots right? Pulse mines?

ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,Electric999999,3,Mon Jul 6 13:18:06 2015 UTC,It is. It's also not that bad if you can predict the bots' movements and hit it in the back with a pulse slug or two.
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,Electric999999,2,Mon Jul 6 17:05:40 2015 UTC,Bare in mind there's at least one point where enemies will know where you are even if you're hidden. The marked man with the first red glare will start shooting at you from the top of a building once you jump off the ledge into his little area.
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,NoOneImportant4,4,Mon Jul 6 16:32:26 2015 UTC,How much damage would a crit from a guass rifle with max charge ammo do?
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,7,Mon Jul 6 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"Gauss Rifle (max charge ammo has a 1.5 ammo multiplier and a -10 DT effect):  (120 + (60x1.5) - 5) x 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.75 x 1.13 = 1,042 with headshot, 521 without.  YCS/186, the unique variant found in the Mojave:  (140 + (70x1.5) - 5) x 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.75 x 1.13 = 1,220 with headshot, 610 without, can one-shot deathclaws below level 50 in the Divide.

ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:14:55 2015 UTC,I don't recall what he did with YCS/186 earlier in the run...I get the odd suspicion that he sold/disposed of/never picked up the weapon.
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,2,Mon Jul 6 04:22:25 2015 UTC,Jon never got the YCS because he had the Anti-Material Rifle instead and was focusing more on guns than energy weapons.
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Jul 6 05:16:10 2015 UTC,"Well, if the YCS is still on the corpse of the mercenary, he should go get it posthaste."

ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,2,Mon Jul 6 09:23:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jon ever engaged that camp, so they should all still be there waiting to fight.  ....Luuuuuckily, a single sneak attack explosive round from the AMR should be enough to kill the whole lot of them."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,Electric999999,4,Mon Jul 6 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"Also, in terms of level - I'm thinking I should aim to complete the highway section BEFORE hitting level 40."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,thirdtotheleft,3,Mon Jul 6 09:46:10 2015 UTC,"Deathclaws will one-hit kill you no matter what, and even the Level 40 variety can't stand up to a sneak crit (headshot or otherwise) from YCS/186 with Max Charge, so...  Marked men scale at level 30 (so that ship has sailed) and tunnelers don't scale at all.  Deathclaws are your only worry...and, if you went insane and decided to take on Rawr, even he goes down to a headshot sneak crit, so..."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,Revelations216,2,Mon Jul 6 10:29:38 2015 UTC,"Don't worry - if I get as far as Rawr, I'll just be making a beeline for the Temple - no way I'm going near that cave."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,Revelations216,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:36:58 2015 UTC,"Good call.  In many ways Rawr is scarier than the Legendary Deathclaw (900 HP, 350 melee damage for Rawr, 1000 HP and 250 damage for the Legendary.)"
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,bdfull3r,2,Mon Jul 6 10:42:28 2015 UTC,I always found the Fist of Rawr disappointing for how much effort it takes and how late it comes.
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,forgodandthequeen,2,Mon Jul 6 10:50:49 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of other unarmed weapons that are more powerful and don't require you to fight a giant alpha deathclaw to get them.  The Saturnite Fist (super-heated) from Old World Blues does 5 more points of damage, and the Industrial Hand in Lonesome Road does the same damage but ignores DR/DT, essentially making it an unarmed version of the Man Opener (if you hold down the attack button, it acts like a chainsaw...plus you can sneak it into casinos as an improved holdout weapon...)  The ordinary Ballistic Fist in the basegame outclasses the Fist of Rawr by 30 DAM."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:58:34 2015 UTC,"Given how late it comes, I feel it would be fair if it did 350 damage. If that's how much Rawr does, that seems fair, but maybe with a strength requirement of 10, as well as 100 in unarmed - with a big debuff for every strength you're short of...? Something like that."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,bolsey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:01:51 2015 UTC,"A weapon capable of doing 350 base damage would certainly screw up the lore of Lonesome Road being intended as the final chapter in the Courier's story, because everyone would try to get that weapon ASAP on account of it could one-shot almost everything in the basegame (even the Legendary Deathclaw would go down in three hits.)  For a debuff, I'm thinking give it a 250 AP requirement so you simply cannot ever use it in VATS.  Most unarmed weapons let you get several swipes in."
ManyATrueNerd,3c94mm,bolsey,2,Mon Jul 6 11:07:07 2015 UTC,"Also Deathclaws will one-shot me, but in some ways, I'm not so worried, because of And Stay Back blended with GRX - I just can't see them getting close enough to get in a swipe...  I'm more scared of getting hit by weapons, especially in moments like the High Road entrance, with that troll barricade just after the ramp..."

But the sierra madre vault is a special kind of awful, especially because you have to shut down the alarms first and deal with the holograms afterwards.  And that one projector on the wall was the death of my character a couple of times. But Jon is an awesome gamer, so there is hope."
ManyATrueNerd,3c6q0r,Domperidone,4,Sun Jul 5 11:00:28 2015 UTC,"I think he survived OWB because he didn't go where he didn't have to go, especially the cazador and nightstalker facilities. Surviving either of those under Jon's rules is like a coin flip."
ManyATrueNerd,3c6q0r,Revelations216,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Cazadors shouldn't pose too much of a threat with the heartless perk, vats and vances gun. I've never taken any damage in the pepsinae lab, shadis/nightstalkers on the other hand are indeed troublesome. Yeah, the whole influencing people thing is very challenging. Cuckoo's nest f.e or that lab with the trauma harnesses. It's only sensible to avoid all that stuff.   I'm more impressed how he wasn't killed by roboscorpions, tbh. They are so hard to kill of you don't have the pulse gun/ protonic inversal axe/ ycs gauss rifle with max mf cells."
ManyATrueNerd,3c6q0r,Domperidone,2,Sun Jul 5 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"For the roboscorpions, sonic emitter Tarantula to make them potentially explode on criticals and the Compliance regulator to paralyze them worked very well."
ManyATrueNerd,3c6q0r,Revelations216,11,Sun Jul 5 19:44:44 2015 UTC,I reckon he can survive the vault cause for the most part you can sneak around and not really fight anyone for it. Surviving Lonesome Road is what has me worried cause of all the marked men having good weapons cause Jon's at a high level.

ManyATrueNerd,3c6q0r,paleoreef103,3,Sun Jul 5 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"I've tried this out a bunch of times on PS3 (ultimate edition), and when it works it's great.  The problem is, it frequently doesn't.  Then you're murdered.  The tunnelers sort of accumulate on the platform and pace about, and some of them will die in the scripted explosions (which do not damage you), but the survivors don't disappear when you reach the bottom (two of them usually).  If you aren't detected, it's much easier than using Turbo/GRX and killing them one by one as they drop onto the platform, but if they detect you, you're dead.  The back right corner seems to be a good spot to cower in.    Also, the flare gun isn't effective on the elevator-- there's nowhere for them to run off to, so they just run around in flames for a few seconds and then kill you."

ManyATrueNerd,3c6q0r,Cheesle,2,Sun Jul 5 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to see Jon's reaction to accidentally locking himself in the vault, a more realistic prediction would be that he'll make it out with stealth as long as he knows where he is going."

You don't move that much more slowly with it drawn, but it adds up considering that you barely escape as it is. (EDIT: Forgot about GRX.)    Also, don't you take explosion damage during the escape? Or are those just one point to make the shield icon show up?    Those are my finale worries."

ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,ManyATrueNerd,21,Sat Jul 4 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"Hi Jon, This is Alex from TechnologyX.com   For CPU if you can afford the i7 4790K it's something I'd consider. If not the AMD 8 cores are solid choices. The i7 is a fantastic CPU though.   Motherboard depends on CPU socket type. So for the i7 4790K you would need a 1150 socket motherboard (other boards wont fit) Or on AMD the AM3+ socket. This is something I recommend speaking to one of us about in detail as motherboards are where all the ports on your system come from.   As for memory, Pick up a 16GB kit from Kingston, Gskill, Corsair, Adata or any of the others. as long as the memory is reliable it is fine.   Storage: Dont get the caviar green, those are slow drives that have a short lifespan when used heavily. a Seagate 2-3TB should do you fine. and you can always add drives as you need them. This drive we actually reviewed here http://www.technologyx.com/pc-hardware/seagate-st3000dm001-3tb-hdd-review-large-capacity-at-a-low-price/  As for an SSD, I'll ship you the Msata drive I have lying around all you'll need is an adapter they go for about 20 dollars here on amazon.   All those cards are fantastic. The 390 is a good idea if you plan on adding a lot of Graphics mods into fallout because of the larger pool of Vram. All of those cards are solid though it just ends up on what your budget lines up to be.   PSU Don't get the corsair builder, the Dead on Arrival rates on those things are horrendous. A friend of mine who works at a big retailer said they had a 30% return rate on them. EVGA 600B PSU is a good replacement for a few dollars more.   For a case again depends on how much you have left to spend. EDIT: I added the build list here for more visibility. Any ones opinions are welcome here.

ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,Droppinbodies,2,Sat Jul 4 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent build, so I second this recommendation, although I agree with/u/attackzac21 that you should get a little beefier power supply. No point in cutting it close if you don't have to. Also, running it by /r/buildapc is a great idea. They will happily make sure you get the most for your money. Good luck Jon. I can't wait :)"
ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,spdbump08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:55:31 2015 UTC,the PSU might be a little tiny considering the 390x draws like 350 watts of power. Also depending on what john is gonna be playing 8GB might be a bit much but better to have it and not need then need it and not have it.  Other than that this list is pretty damn good. I'd definitely go with the 390x over the 290x or 970. 970 is a great card but that 3.5gb of VRAM isn't enough for video production imo.
ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,attackzac21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply.   The PSU could get a bit beefier and I always generally recommend going a bit overboard with a Power supply I do agree there, there is some slightly better ones for a bit more money.  8GB is fantastic if you're heavily modding games or plan on eventually crossfiring the cards which that PSU can't handle but thats besides the point.   The 390X is a really good value right now and some models are going after the 980, so if you can deal with AMD that is a great GPU."

ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,Nintendawgz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Here's a bit more about mechanical keyboards!  For your needs (silent), I'd recommend either Cherry MX red or Cherry MX brown switches. Reds are linear (silent, slight noise if you bottom out, light actuation force), and browns are bumpy (slight tactile bump at actuation, light force, same noise as reds).    If you want complete silence, you can put o-rings on all of the keys to get rid of the bottoming out sound. CODE keyboards has nice 104-key (numpad) and TKL (no numpad) keyboards with o-rings already installed if taking all the keycaps off is too much of a hassle.

Don't forget, you'll need a Windows licence :)  Also note, that motherboard is micro-ATX, so a smaller form factor than normal ATX. Not an issue for the most part, just means less expansion slots. If you don't plan on having SLI/Crossfire, or having a load of PCI expansion cards, you'll be fine. It also means you can go for a smaller case if wanted.  In the post, you put the AMD 8350 as a CPU suggestion. My advice is don't. I have it in my PC, and while (at the time) it was good value for money (performance/price) it lags behind the i5/i7 in terms of raw power. i7 seems to be pretty standard for most Youtubers/Twitchers.

ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,templar_,3,Sat Jul 4 20:22:23 2015 UTC,"Okay here goes...  CPU: I actually have both the 4790K and the AMD 8350. Both are excellent, the 4790k uses less power so it runs cooler, the AMD is great for applications that can use the extra cores.  Memory: The Ripjaws series is excellent, I use it in both of my machines. You will not really benefit from the faster memory in anything but synthetic benchmarks and really high end software (3D, animation, CAD, etc). 1600mhz is about where you want to be.  Video Card: I will admit i'm an NVIDIA fan, I'd go for the NVIDIA side over AMD but thats just me. I currently have a 980, but anything over a 960 would do admirably. I prefer EVGA for my NVIDIA cards. Storage: This bit is going to be important for you. You want a faster drive, a faster drive will increase your responsiveness in your editing suite and improve data transfers a bit. I personally like the Western Digital Black in whatever size suits you.   SSD: I can't recommend the Samsung EVO 840 enough. I have two of them, a 250gb for my boot drive and a 750gb for my steam library. If you can swing a spare SSD (maybe about 500gb or so) to just sit your Steam library on I would highly recommend it. The speed is truly impressive in games that can use that. Fallout for me has near instantaneous load screens when its sitting on my SSD, thats including a few tweaks but overall the load times are drastically decreased.  Motherboard: Do NOT go with ASRock, their RMA rate is very high compared to other manufacturers. The others you posted are fine, I prefer ASUS for my motherboard, however EVGA makes excellent motherboards and their customer support is legendary.   PSU: I wouldn't go above about 750 at the most. Corsair makes excellent PSUs, the other thing you want is for the PSU to be FULLY modular. Your PC builder will thank you, and the overall finished product will be much nicer.   Case: I REALLY REALLY like Fractal Design cases. The Fractal Design Define R4 is the best case i've ever had, comes in lots of variations, is designed to keep your computer quiet, has TONS of customization inside, and has a really nice modern aesthetic.   Extra bits:   Extra Bit 1(recording):You may want to have something like an Avermedia Live Gamer HD for recording. The reason you would want something like this is so that you do not have to use a software solution for recording which with cause a performance hit. Using a sideloading hardware recording solution will allow you to run games better, and with better quality while recording, in turn making games feel better to record and letting you up the visual fidelity at the same time.  Extra Bit 2(editing): You may want to invest in a cheaper but higher capacity SSD if you are using Adobe Suite to use as a Scratch Disk. Having a drive like this can speed up your editing because it allows premiere to load footage from your storage drive on the fly and keep your disks from being tied up by essentially writing that data to the scratch disk temporarily. It is essentially like having a very large chunk of RAM that is just dedicated to video. NOTE: If you do this make SURE that this disk is clearly labeled as a SCRATCH DISK. The reason you want this is you that you can easily identify it amongst your other drives so that you don't accidentally park something important in there. Scratch disks can be set to manual or automatic deletion at the end of your editing session so KEEP THAT IN MIND.  Extra Bit 3(cooling): I recommend a nice all in one liquid cooler for your CPU. There are lots of these around, but I personally always use Corsair. I have both an H110 and an H90 and have never had a problem. I also recommend good quality fans, the best around are made by Noctua but they are pricey, and running all your fans off a separate controller that runs off your CPUs main fan header(NZXT makes a couple of these).  Hope this helps!"

I'd edit until it filled up and then clear it maunally and finish the edit. I don't do much video editing anymore but when I did I was editing daily for over a year. I may have had the holy grail of SSD but it still works just as well as when I bought it.

Put your budget in description and everyone will better be able to help you way more then now. Like 970 is ok, but with Fallout 4 coming out AND recording it, I assume, form it, you need a pretty high power machine. If you have an extra couple hundred, I'd recommend the 980 ti, but idk because there's no budget.  CPU: Intel i7, because the AMD CPU is not compatible with any of the listed motherboards. If you were just gaming I'd not recommend it, but I assume your also going to render videos out on here to.  Motherboards: Gigabyte GA-Z97X-SLI ATX LGA1150 Motherboard, better for future upgradeability, liek for SLI, M.2. support, SATA Express, Broadwell, etc. No point of Micro ATX unless you want that form factor.  Case: ??? One of the most important things but can't say if you care about the form factor or not, so can't make a recommendation. Also fans, etc.  RAM: Use the pro Storage: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FQH7MQ2/ref=psdc_1254762011_t1_B00EHBEUZO Faster then both the 2 TB one and the 4 TB one, and only for $10 more then WD Green, perfect.  SSD: SSD is fine  Video Card: I'm a Nvidia fanboy, so yeah. All of your listed cards have HDMI out, along with a bunch of other display options. If you can, buy a minimum 980 or 980 ti if you can for Fallout 4.  Optical Drive: Fine.

ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,Palodin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"Are you installing Windows and all drivers yourself or will someone else take care of that in addition to assembling it?  Couple things about the storage options, I would, as others have already pointed out, go with a Samsung Evo 850 for a main SSD. It's also more complicated but I run 2 SSDs, a smaller one [128GB] for Win7 and apps [browser, vent, vlc, etc.] and a large SSD for games. You might have already heard about this but load times in games when installed on a SSD are much, much shorter.  As far as storage I would again look into 2 drives if your budget supports it. This will allow you to run a raid 1 array. Raid1 means that all data is written to both drives and if one drive does die you still have an exact copy of all your data on the other. It will show up as one drive in Windows. This is really just for peace of mind, Seagate and WD make very reliable HDDs. I'm not familiar with video editing but I imagine losing several hours of edited footage would be a big deal.  And lastly I always recommend overspending on your motherboard and getting an ASUS. I'm a bit oldschool though, and stubborn so I don't use anything but ASUS and haven't since I built my 5th PC in 1998.  edit: /u/Bowlington mentioned Fractal Design cases, I use one and agree, they are very good."

The majority of modern graphics cards have a HDMI-out. The gaming ones at least are almost certain to (Your GTX 960/970s, R9 290X whatevers and so on). Very easy to check anyway, it's usually clearly listed under specifications.  In terms of the options you're considering here's what I'd go for:   Intel Core i7-4790K 3.6GHz Quad-Core Processor (I mean, the i5 will be just as good for games if budgets a concern but I suppose you might be rendering on it so fair enough) Well, it's going to be one of the LGA1150 boards, choose whichever form factor suits your case I guess (MATX vs Full ATX), they're both fine for performance. The Corsair Vengeance RAM I suppose, faster is good. While it's 4TB, The WD Green is going to be bad for gaming. Any game that needs fast disc access will suffer. The barracuda would be better. Ideally you'd want a seperate games and recording drive but if budgets a thing then the faster drive is better. I suppose the SSD could be used for the games, though 256Gb isn't a huge amount. Should be fine but you'll be deleting stuff to make room occasionally. The GTX970 Twin Frozr hands down, bought one a month ago, love it. The R9 290 is a great card but the GTX970 delivers similar performance for cheaper and has much better driver support. Optical Drive is fine. You won't be using it much so any old tat will do, wouldn't spend more than £15 personally unless you want to watch blurays on your PC. I'd probably go with the corsair power supply myself. Both should be sufficient but I've had better experience with corsair.   I've not got any good advice for cases, I've been using the same cheap £40 Antec one for the last 8 years.

It's not particularly necessary to go for a X99 board for the system you've built I'd say it's overkill, instead save yourself £50 or so and go for something like the MSI Z97 Gaming 5, has all the features you need without going over the top and fairly futureproof for now (although that term is a bit of a misnomer). Corsair Vengeance Pro memory good choice, I've always stood by it! With you're storage if you are only using the SSD for boot and programs stick to a 250GB Samsung 850 EVO of something, tbh 120GB would do but I don't want to sell your system short. For storing your games you'll want something like a 1-2TB WD Caviar Black, the WD Green is too slow really for anything but archival storage, so I would suggest getting like a 4TB one of those as well for storing your videos, they are nice and cheap! Definitely go for the GTX 970, fantastic performance for its price, regular driver updates over AMD and if you want a bit more power later just go ahead and bung another one in there in SLI! Just buy any old dvd drive it doesn't really matter although I've always stuck with Samsung. Importantly I would buy a 750W power supply instead just to be safe, and this would be necessary if you later wanted to SLI as well.

Performance is only half the equation...you want a card that won't have you all over the Internet fixing its buggy driver software."
ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,templar_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:08:57 2015 UTC,"Looks like you've already decided on Intel as a processor.  All the motherboards you have are Intel based.  Motherboards usually determine how many USB ports you have.  (You can, in theory add more usb ports with PCI cards, but the ones directly on the motherboard seem to be more reliable and faster.)    I put together a comparison on Newegg, that will let you compare the number of USB ports on the motherboards that you mentioned.  I also swapped out the ASRock H81M for the ASRock B85M, which is newer.  There are two lines.  One for usb 2.0 and one for 3.0.  3.0 usb is much faster and is probably what a lot of stuff like external hard drives and video output devices will be using.  It's also backwards compatible with usb 2.0, so you can usually just add them onto the usb 2.0 count.  All the motherboards you selected have at least 6 in total.  Also, you should make your selections on final parts, then see how many you can find on Amazon UK and setup a wishlist to share with the community.  I'll bet many of us would be willing to chip in for specific parts and pieces.  Share it for a week and then buy anything that's still missing."

ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,Bowlington,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"X99 motherboards can't be used with the i7-4970k, I think they can only be used with the i7-5xxx chips.  Get an X9something board to overclock with. You can only overclock with boards with an X prefix. If yiu want to save the money then get a non-k intel chip. Not sure how it works with AMD.  I have a gigabyte motherboard, it's great. Looks good, works perfeft, built really solid.  If money is a problem, I would get a small SSD, maybe 120gb and use it for the OS and any imprtant programs (keep at least 15gbs free or it'll slow down), then maybe a 500-1tb 7200rpm drive for games, and then a 2-4tb drive for vids. Seriously, having a drive dedicated to games is so helpful. If you wanted an ssd for games I'd say 500gb minimum.  Can't say about gpu.  Higher speed ram will help a little with rendering.  GET AN AFTERMARKET FAN. Intel and AMD stock fans are pretty shit. They work but are loud and not that good. Hyper Evo 212 is like $20 and is fantastic.  Final general recommendations: leave overclocking as a possibility. It'll help you squeeze another 2 years of use out of the computer, and will help substantially both in games and rendering. Make sure you have the cooling to compensate.  Never skimp on a PSU. You're computer will explode with a cheap PSU. It's only a matter of when. Everything else has leeway for it's price, not the PSU though. Always leave room for expansion, even if there's only the slightest chance you'll actually ever do it.  I'm on my phone so I can't do a part by part breakdown, but overall it looks pretty good. I hope you enjoy it when you get it, it's a whole 'nother world."
ManyATrueNerd,3c4eb6,Sandwich247,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"We will need some information on what your budget is and what resolution you will be playing games at currently and in the future. That way we can plan ahead. If you are just going to be gaming at 1080 and won't be upgrading to 4k in a long time, that would change where we budget parts. If you think you will be doing 4k in the somewhat near future, then we go a little more high end. I'll link two builds, one for 4k and one for 1080. AFter reading some coments, it seems like you might want a bunch of drives, one for game playing on an SSD, one for game storage on a hard drive, one for video storage on a hard drive, one for video editing on an SSD, and one more drive (not sure if it needs to be a hard drive or if an SSD will do, that is for someone else to answer) to use while editing that automatically wipes itself.   4K Ready  1080 only but way overkill  No matter what, it seems like you will be spending a lot of money on hard drives.

I'd recommend the i7 and the GTX 970.  In terms of power supply, I always found Corsair to be the best. (The one you have listed is actually the one in my system!)   For HDD, go WD. For Motherboard, I'd go AsRock if price is a concern, if not go one of the other two. I'm not an expert on SSD's but from what I hear the one you have there is good.

Motheboard: Asus X99 Delux Beacuse 10 USB 3, thats why. Also Asus have great warranty.  CPU: Intel i7  5930K Intel because you said you aren't overclocking and this is pretty much the best you can do without overclocking.  Cooler: Noctua NH-D14  The quietest, best performing CPU cooler at its price point.  RAM: HyperX XMP Predator 16GiB Kingston make good memory and we need DDR4 for X99. Also 16GiB beacuse video rendering.  GPU: 2 EVGA NVIDIA GTX 980s in SLI (or 1 980 Ti if that is too pricey) EVGA have the best GPU warranties (literally no questions asked), and it has to be NVIDIA for the smallest performance hit. 2 980s will eat anything for breakfast.  Storage 1: Samsung Evo 1Tb This will have Windows and your games on, nothing else. Why 1TB? Modern games are big.  Storage 2: 1 Western Digital Black 1TB drive and 1 WD 2TB Green Drive The Black drive has all your documents on it and anything that isn't video footage, it is backed up to the 2TB Green Drive on a weekly basis.  Storage 3: 2 Western Digital Black 4TB Drives These are in RAID 1 (1 drive holds an exact mirror of the other). And before you say 'but RAID isn't backup', I know, but no sane person backs up video files and still has hours in the day left to use. This way, there is a mirror to fall back on if one drive fails, you only need replace that one drive and recompute.  I think that's it. I'm also in the UK (and quite close if you are where I think) so I can also help build."

ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RealFoxD,13,Wed Jul 1 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"All of this can be dealt with, mostly by bringing stealth boys, mines and a rad suit. A lot of enemies can be sniped, the usual Jon method of killing and hiding until Hidden again.   The Deathclaws always appear in the same spots which makes it easier to mine the hell out in front of you before drawing attention. The ambushes can be dealt with by mines and implant GRX and a riot shotgun if Jon uses And Stay Back perk.  You can fast travel and leave the DLC to restock mines, ammo, etc as needed which helps a ton.  The elevator ride isn't too bad with Stealth boys, you will be in caution the whole time and take 40-100 rads I forget how much. Jon has 10 endurance IIRC so all he needs is a rad suit.  The tunnelers aren't hard to avoid with stealth boys, depending on what he does with ED-E  Jon will surprise us I am sure, he will take Lonesome road VERY seriously  edit: also Lonesome road is really static, every encounter is the same which makes it much easier to plan and counter  edit 2: Just ran through at level 40 to the elevator part. With 85 rad resist you take about 10 rads up to and including the elevator. The only insanely difficult part is getting the detonator/red glare at the first part. He spawns on top of the building and fires right away (ROCKET BARRAGE), impossible to kill him before he fires without GRX/Turbo and fast+accurate aim but I was able to do it reliably with turbo and Anti-mat rifle. The ambush after picking up the detonator isn't hard if you mine the area (bottlecap mines seem to be the only reliable mines, but maybe satchels would work too, because plasma/frag mines don't seem to trigger fast enough, bottlecap mines with a few frag mines will kill them on spawning). Using mines is tough unless you know where to mines though (behid the buildings)  The elevator is pretty easy with a 12.7mm SMG fully modded and hollowpoint rounds along with a stealthboy, just hide in a corner and you take 0 damage and only 6-8 rads. ED-E attracts the attention if you fail to kill any tunnelers.  Deathclaws are easy 1 hit stealth kills using YCS/186 Gauss rifle with Max Charge Microfusions (~260 damage and -10 DT without drugs and crit multipliers)  To do Lonesome road it's prob best to bring a 12.7mm SMG, Anti-mat rifle, YCS/186, Space Suit (40 rad resist), and pickup the breathmask at the start of the DLC."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,carl1984,10,Wed Jul 1 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"You are right BUT all it takes is one mistake. Marked men and tunnelers are not ghost people or lobotomites - they were designed to be a challenge for high-level character playing per vanilla rules. Yes, you can prepare and counter. However there is a huge difference between being hit one with a throwing spear by one of the ghost people and being hit by bullet from anti-material rifle fired by marked men sniper. All I'm saying is that - assuming Jon survives - the ""Lonesome Road"" will be incredibily tough.  It will be awesome to watch though: one small mistake, one ""oops"", one ""I forgot about this!"" and it's over. The tension will be incredible! :D"

ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,Cheesle,6,Thu Jul 2 14:25:49 2015 UTC,...so what you're saying is mine the hell out of it?  As long as he avoids the bus of terror (where a deathclaw drops on top of it when you enter) and takes it as seriously as before I trust that he'll surprise us.

ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RealFoxD,8,Thu Jul 2 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"Where regards ""Deathclaws on steroids"":  Jon should be right around level 40 when he's done with Dead Money---that's where the Big Jump occurs in difficulty (enemies level with the player at 30, 40, and 50.)  Level 40 Lonesome Road deathclaws have 600 HP and 15 DT plus a 280-point melee attack; one hit and Jon's dead.  They are, in essence, the toughness of a Deathclaw Mother and the speed (but not the HP; 600 vs. 750) of a Deathclaw Alpha Male.  Scary stuff.  But let's throw the red challenge flag on your assertion that they can stand up to an anti-materiel rifle sniper shot...rather than go in-game and play around with this, I'll use math from the wiki this time around.  The damage calculation in New Vegas, according to the wiki: Damage inflicted = (DMG + (CRITDMG x BC)- DT) x SA x HS x AM x DM x Perk multipliers   (that's Damage plus Critical damage x Better Criticals, minus DT of the target, or (110 + (110*1.5) - 15), or 260 base damage with an anti-materiel rifle.)  That 260 can be further modified by a sneak attack (doubles it to 520), headshot (doubles it again to 1040), difficulty level (cuts it by 25%, back down to 780), damage perks (Bloody Mess, Lord Death, Abominable, etc.)...  ...so, by back of the envelope math, Jon will not only need to land sneak attack criticals, but they will have to be headshots or the deathclaws will stand up to them and come back for more.  Yikes."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RedditTotalWar,10,Wed Jul 1 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"I just did a quick in game test (level 50), and took some sneak attach critical, non-head shots at the Death Claws.   Anti Materiel needed 2 shots to kill. 2 bars of health remaining after 1 shot.  HOWEVER. Paciencia with Hollow Point ammo is a one hit kill for me.    It might not be a 1 hit kill for Jon as I don't believe he has the purifier perk, which adds 50% damage. HOWEVER, Paciencia with hollow point ammo does seem to be the better way to go.  Edited - maybe Psycho/Slasher can help push the damage up to a 1 hit kill?"
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RealFoxD,7,Thu Jul 2 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Psycho and Slasher, or maybe just one or the other, would be enough to do it at level 40.  I'm pretty sure Jon has Bloody Mess (right?), two ranks of the Lord Death perk, and I know for a fact (since it just came up in the most recent episode) that he has two ranks of Abominable.  That's (1.05 * 1.02 * 1.06) or an extra 13.53% cumulative damage multiplier.  I'm also assuming he has Better Criticals...that has to be the case, right?  Plugging the number back into the formula and assuming he's using regular .50 MG ammo---he hasn't gone for Hand Loader, which would let him craft the sublime Match stuff that I personally use...  Base damage: 110 + (110*1.5) - 15, or 260.  Double for sneak attack, cut to 3/4 damage due to difficulty level he's playing on (Hard), then times 1.135 for those other perks...hmm...that's only 442 damage.  If he uses Psycho, that gets multiplied by 1.25, for a total of 553 damage...still not enough to get through the 600 that a level 40 Deathclaw has.  Yep...to get a one-hit kill without a headshot, he'll need to use Psycho and Slasher.  Oh well, what's a little horrible addiction for PD Shoot, huh?  As for Paciencia/HP ammo...an interesting point.  A high-enough damage weapon will get a bigger boost from the 1.75x damage multiplier than it loses from adding 30 DT to the target (because of the x3 DT modifier.)  Never thought about what that would mean in terms of the calculation, but...  Paciencia has 55 DAM, but 110 critical damage, with those numbers both multiplied by 1.75 for HP ammo.  (96+(192*1.5)-45) = 339 base damage, then putting it through the rest of the calculation means it should do 576 damage...in theory, which should leave 24 HP left on the deathclaw.  Another rank of Abominable or Lord Death (obtainable by farming abominations in the Mojave before hitting the Lonesome Road and/or wiping out a few towns Kill Everything-style with silent sneak criticals?) might just be enough.  Or, y'know, Psycho and/or Slasher."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RealFoxD,3,Thu Jul 2 06:03:46 2015 UTC,"I thought of something else...EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS.  They do 80 points of explosion damage, and that might just be enough to push it into lethal territory on a sneak crit."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,carl1984,2,Thu Jul 2 23:01:54 2015 UTC,I would probably use psycho and slasher if I was relying on a one hit snipe
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,Calmiche,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:13:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have the most effective build (I prefer taking perks like Jury Rigging or +50pounds carrying capacity so that the game is less frustrating) but yesterday I sneak headshoted deathclaw with anti-material rifle AP and he did survive. IMHO it's way too risky to engage them at all, better just sneak by. The question is how many Stealth Boys Jon still have?"
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,Mrs_Brisby,9,Thu Jul 2 08:36:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm...  I still have ""deathclaws"" in the death betting pool.  You mean I might still have a chance of winning?  I thought I was out of the running."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RedditTotalWar,9,Wed Jul 1 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"You probably have the best chance right now, to be honest"
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RealFoxD,7,Thu Jul 2 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"With some luck, I think Jon can pull it off. I would recommend the following 2 general tactics.  1) NUKES. Any encounter that Jon can start off from a distance and get a good shot in should use these (i.e. death claws on the bridge). Why risk a fight when you can just end it? Jon will have to be careful not to further radiate himself.   2) GOD MODE for unavoidable close combat.    Combine Med-X, Slasher, and Battle Brew for 85% damage resistance (and a whole slew of other bonuses).  Implant GRX - slow time, avoid getting hit.  Chemist Perk - doubles the duration of the drugs/GRX above. Damage Resistance's weak link is Slasher which has a  1 min duration (2 with chemist).    The 85% resistance, plus a 46 DT (I forgot what Jon had, but this is attainable) means a 300 damage attack from a legendary death claw (highest in game?) is reduced to its minimum - 9 damage. Hopefully, GRX will help Jon avoid getting hit at all.   If GRX is unavailable and Jon doesn't abuse resting - Turbo is our alternative.   PD Shoot will likely become an addict... but at this point, who cares?"
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,thirdtotheleft,3,Thu Jul 2 00:14:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jon has the Survival or Medicine skills to get maximum effect/duration/ability to craft the stuff that can't be bought.  Med-X is easy enough to find, but making Battle Brew would not only require a level's worth, maybe two, of points into Survival (it requires Survival 50 at a campfire), but just where do you propose he gets the Salient Green and Mutant Cave Fungus (both Old World Blues-exclusive items only found in Big MT)?  He'd have to take a trip back there, and brave hazards just to gather the ingredients.  Good idea in theory, unlikely to work in practice on Jon's build."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RedditTotalWar,3,Thu Jul 2 00:27:06 2015 UTC,"You can use a Lad's Life for 20 levels of Survival, and I don't know if he kept the Park Ranger hat from Honest Hearts but that's a 5 survival bonus as well."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,bolsey,2,Thu Jul 2 09:38:30 2015 UTC,"Slasher should be pretty easy to craft - it requires science which Jon has maxed out. Just the 25% damage bonus from Slasher/Psycho would be great asset to have.    You're right about the Battle Brew - Jon won't be able to get some without risk at this point (he'll need to do X-22, which I don't think he's done). I don't think he grabbed the pre-made bottles from the Stealth armor research facility because he'd likely wanted to avoid the nightstalkers (it's been a while).   50% resistance is still doable and useful. The full 85% resistance would've been nice for certain choke-point/boss fights though, but not worth venturing into X-22.   Edited - for others who don't have survival to brew battle brew, you can use a special ""battle brew still"" you find in the X-13 facility (where you get the talking stealth suit). This video (not mine) shows you where: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEu3YXN9hhk"

ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,dv666,2,Thu Jul 2 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"On the subject of Deathclaws, psycho might allow Jon to defeat them in a single hit. Most of them can be engaged from a distance as well, so he'll be able to lay down some of the satchel charges that Lonesome Road is so very generous with ahead of time. In addition, armor does not matter with Deathclaws. They ignore both DT and DR. You're better off removing it to move faster."
ManyATrueNerd,3bscko,RealFoxD,2,Thu Jul 2 11:50:45 2015 UTC,"I've done this without dying, in Hardcore Mode, but that was bringing high-heal-rate items like Desert Salad, Wasteland Omelets, Bloatfly Sliders, Bighorner Steaks, and 100 Survival to make maximum use of them.  Doing it as essentially a ""one hit, maybe two, and you're dead?""  Jon would have a better chance of playing Missile Command for 24 hours straight and not losing a city."

Also, funny thing, you can throw on all ten uses of the Implant GRX and rush through the area. There's no artificial gates you have to wait for so as long as you don't get lost you can power through it in no time at all. Even use some Turbo if you need to. Super simple stuff."

ManyATrueNerd,3bo6j7,herbska,3,Tue Jun 30 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"I have no expirience starting a wiki, but websites in general. Before we start there is one question: Do we want to host it by ourself or do we want to have it easily set up on e.g. wikia. Both options do have advantages.  Wikia:  Easy setup, probably more/easy clicks if it's featured on the wikia-frontpage.  Hosting it:  Total control over the data, possibility to back it up completly to secure the data and move it if needed (i have a neet little script for backing up my hosted websites automatically(mainly wordpress installations) from ftp site and also creating sql dumps, i could implement it on a self hosted wiki, too.)  Disadvantages:  Wikia:  You never know how long internet companies exist, and if you're informed beforehand if it goes south, so you may have no chance to secure your data. Plus, I don't know if you can backup data at hosters like wikia. Will look into that right away.  Self hosted:  It's work... Setting up a wiki should be laughable, we're talking 15 minutes max. Finding a suitable theme could take longer... and adjusting it fully to our needs. Plus, self hosting does not come for free. However, for a test / starting phase I could cram it on to my webserver. If it goes live and exceeds my bandwith quota I would most likely have to upgrade my hosting package... But it may not even happen, I have 3-5 GB per month buffer atm. Might be enough for a while.  TLDR: I will take a closer look on wikia right now, write my input. An self hosted alternative would have to wait at least until 10/7/15 since I'm on vacation in France at the moment.  (Edits for text formation... I dont know reddit that well...)"
ManyATrueNerd,3bo6j7,herbska,3,Wed Jul 1 11:01:06 2015 UTC,"So, I did some research.   Created a test wiki on wikia. There is no way of backing up your data and there is a brutal amount of ads, to the extend that I didn't testet any further.  There is a quite good article on wiki sites:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_hosting_services  Under general comparision I stumbled upon wikidot. It has a decent Alexa rank (so there may be some bigger sites on the hoster, i dont any of them...), and it offer the possibility to deactive ads displayed on the site. This comes for a monthly fee... which I'd happily pay (I don't seem to get patreon, but with the wiki I could support the great case of manyatruenerd...)  Still, even with wikidot, you don't seem to have an option to secure your data... If the hoster disappears, so does our content.  So, input anyone?"

I am a staff member on ShoutWiki (http://www.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page).

They led a sizable rebellion (although not nearly as large as the one portrayed in the game), and were put down with the combined power of the Chinese government, Europe, and America.

Being a weaker character does hinder the story. It's not designed for weak characters."
ManyATrueNerd,3bkcr3,Kittenclysm,0,Tue Jul 7 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"It does make you specialize more, you cant deny that, with high int you can just drop skill points into everything and have a great overall character, nit just a good gunman, an unarmed brawler or a melee expert ninja"

This wasn't exactly exhaustively tested, and I'm willing to bet there's going to be quite a bit of variability in the second half of the test.  It's a certainty that the fall will do at least 735 damage (the max HP a Courier can have from level 50, END 10, Life Giver, Buffout, and the Thought You Died perk), but just how much more is an open question depending on just what part of the ground the courier impacts, at what angle, whether the leap off the coaster involves an initial jump upward or whether it's a simple step-off-the-edge fall...  ...plenty of people could compile more data points if they had the free time and the silliness quotient in their sense of humour required to spend a couple of hours repeatedly committing suicide."

ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,ManyATrueNerd,6,Mon Jun 29 11:33:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't able to find figures for New Vegas, but I did find the calculation for Skyrim, and assuming that the Creation Engine inherits something at least similar to this from its Gamebryo forebear, it's probably not completely apples to oranges, especially since according to the Project Nevada mod*, ""Safe Falling Distance"" is 600 units in vanilla New Vegas, the same number Skyrim uses:  Player falling damage = ((height - 600) * 0.1)1.45 * modifiers  So yes, it's exponential, although interestingly it does not appear that it is possible for the player to reach terminal velocity due to air resistance, which would have fascinating consequences if this were true on earth...  *clarification: I use mods for my regular playthroughs but disabled all of them for this test."
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,imacr33per,6,Mon Jun 29 13:46:23 2015 UTC,Does the same calculation apply to Fallout 3?
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,ManyATrueNerd,8,Mon Jun 29 14:42:17 2015 UTC,I would absolutely have to assume so...wait.  I just had an idea.  TENPENNY TOWER.  ...I'll be right back.
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,Sandwich247,9,Mon Jun 29 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"I was about to say - what is the longest drop in Fallout?  Can you get off the side of HELIOS 1? What about Rivet City - some big falls there?  Oh, in Point Lookout, how close is the lighthouse to the cliff edge? Could you throw off that, then down the cliff, to the rocks below?"
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,Sandwich247,6,Mon Jun 29 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Helios One: I've fallen off of it more times than I'd like to admit. (And died every time)  Rivet City: Unless you were to hit some scrap between the two halves of the ship really hard, I don't recall dying from falling.  Point Lookout: I haven't played this DLC, so I don't have any knowledge about it."
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,ManyATrueNerd,7,Mon Jun 29 14:57:43 2015 UTC,There's a ridiculously tall smokestack in it that you can climb - I'd wager it's a longer fall than HELIOS 1 or Tenpenny...
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,ManyATrueNerd,15,Mon Jun 29 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, but Point Lookout...POINT LOOKOUT!  My first test was to climb the lighthouse and jump down the interior---the spiral staircase goes around the outside and leaves a clear path down the centre back to ground.  Total damage: 7,406.  Smaller than Tenpenny Tower.  But then I went outside.  At first, I thought I'd been thwarted...the railing on the outside of the lighthouse catwalk acts as an invisible wall, and you can't jump down from there.  ""Disappointing,"" I thought to myself.  But the stairs that lead up to the actual light where you do that quest during the storyline, those are not protected by an invisible wall.  Climb up them to the landing and jump over the outside corner, and you get a clear fall not only off the lighthouse but off the cliff it's on, and there's enough room between the cliff and the water that you'll hit bare ground---no ""water breaks your fall"" (Havok physics has much softer water than the real world does, apparently.)  My first jump?  I killed my character.  A character I'd modded in the console to have 20,000 HP.  I added 15,000 more HP and tried again.  Total damage?  An amazing 23,748 HP.  I think it's safe to say that short of someone modding Mothership Zeta to let you fall off the side of the alien spaceship and all the way back down to Earth or something, the highest ""leap of faith"" in Fallout 3 is indeed the lighthouse at Point Lookout.  It might not be the highest actual elevation (that catwalk in The Pitt IS pretty high up), but it's the highest elevation with a clear path from which you could fall to ground.  Last tests coming a bit later, as I go back to New Vegas to jump off HELIOS ONE and (possibly with a little help from noclip) the cliffs over the Colorado."
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,ManyATrueNerd,9,Mon Jun 29 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"I just tested the top of the smokestack in The Pitt, from as many angles as I could conceivably find.  Jumping into the ""bottomless pit"" in the middle reveals that the pit isn't actually bottomless---character took 6,413 fall damage.  The fun part isn't the fall damage, it's the radiation---radiation at the core of the smokestack is sufficient to kill in eight seconds even with maxed rad resistance---it'll kill faster than that, faster even than the outside door of Vault 87, without perk/armour/etc.-aided rad resist.  Trying to jump off the apex of the tower turns out to be disappointing.  The large flat area below the apex (where there's a big fight with some wildmen and a turret on the way up) acts as a catch area between the top of the tower and the ground below and limits falling damage to right around 5,000 points (less than half that of just jumping off of Tenpenny Tower.)  Trying to jump off the staging area to ground?  That's a high fall, but again, it's not an unobstructed fall.  I maxed damage around 9,500.  You could probably do better, but not consistently.  All told, the Pitt?  Very disappointing.  Testing Point Lookout next."
ManyATrueNerd,3bgznl,Rinaldootje,4,Mon Jun 29 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"OK, Helios 1 has been tested.  Jumped from the highest point, which is just as you come out the door onto the catwalk, slightly angled so you don't land fairly harmlessly on the level below and in fact plummet all the way to ground.  Total damage: 10,349.  Nice...more than the Primm rollercoaster (and therefore the clubhouse leader for highest fall in the basegame---I'm willing to bet those high-point vistas in Zion are higher and have a clear path to ground but right now I don't have a save on hand where I can simply fast travel to them, so either someone else is going to have to replicate my experiment or else you'll have to wait awhile for me to get there in run of play)...  ...but still not the highest fall in a Fallout base game (assuming 3 and New Vegas use the same fall-damage mechanic, and I can't rightly imagine why they wouldn't) and not even close to the highest fall overall...that Point Lookout lighthouse, man...hot damn."

Highest place it seems you can get to with a clear path the the floor of the valley is just a smidge north of Ranger Station Osprey at the northwest corner of the map.  There are plenty of high spots, some perhaps even higher elevation than the spot I chose, but best I could gather, it was the same problem as the Pitt smokestack---something would interrupt your fall, not allowing you to get all the way from the cliff to the lowest points on the map where you'd ideally want to land.  Total damage: 11,688.  Kind of disappointing, once again.  Still one helluva fall, but barely better than falling off Helios 1.  It's possible New Vegas messes with the gravity, but I doubt it---the Primm coaster and Tenpenny Tower felt like the same basic distance, and Point Lookout was truly one for the ages.  I'm thinking I might just have to try an old-fashioned cheat to get the character into an inaccessible place to find any solid object taller to fall from.  I'm going to do the final test on the cliffs of the Colorado, but so far, it looks like the original thought (the Primm rollercoaster) might just be a top-four or five highest fall in the basegame and a good first-instinct choice."

Then you will have to go back and get onto the top of the room while sneaking past holograms (two if you wait for the right moment, three if you are unlucky) following the green line on this image  Be careful, your collar will be beeping all the time - luckily ther is a safe spot.  Step 4: now it should be easy - you have to destroy/turn off the hologram emitters (blue squares); destroying them turns all holograms hostile so disabling them (possible with repair 100) is a preferable option  That should be it although I think I may have missed one hologram emitter. I hope it will help, because I would really like to see P.D.Shoot in ""Lonesome Road"" ;) Still you would need some luck to pull this off - holograms AFAIK take c. 40-60 dmg with one shot, so if they turn hostile it's game over.

You have to thread the music together because that recreates a recording of the song ""Begin Again"" and Vera Keyes sings those pass phrases in that song.  Playing that song into the speaker is what unlocks it.  You also learn what the pass phrases are after threading the music together.  I don't remember why you learn what the pass phrases are after threading the song together (It has been a long time since I played it) but after you do you can also ask Christine to say them into the speaker instead of playing the song."

But he did use this woman purely for the purpose of fucking over one dude. He's both a victim and a victimizer. I don't think he should die, but if I had this information beforehand I wouldn't have been so nice to him, and therefore he might have tried to kill me.

The purpose of the traps is to aquire more nutrients because these kinds of plants live in areas with very poor soil.

I've made sure in all the scripts I searched that any healing, radiation removal, etc only applies when you don't have the appropriate perk.  Edit: I strongly recommend using this on a new character, both because you really need to start over to get an idea of how fun a YOLO run is, and also because I don't want to be responsible for your main character's healing rate being permanently zeroed.

Anyway, and this may sound like madness, but perhaps some deathclaw hunting east of Outer Vegas or even (gasp) Quarry Junction after Dead Money and before Lonesome Road to try and get a few extra percentage points of damage against the tunnelers (via the Abominable challenge perk)?

ManyATrueNerd,3b9pyy,RealFoxD,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:41:48 2015 UTC,Deathclaws are quite easy to pick off if you have plenty of range so clearing out Quarry Junction wouldn't be too bad. Vault 22 sounds too risky though.
ManyATrueNerd,3b9pyy,acksed,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"Vault 22 if you have good memory of where the dormant spore carriers are (my rule of thumb is to fire a silenced sniper shot into every patch of plants) and don't risk your ass on Keely's little suicide mission at the bottom floor.  Probably too risky for YOLO.  Quarry Junction can, by a skilled player (and Jon clearly is one), be done with, at worst, a deathclaw going into caution---I use a Stealth Boy and a suppressed AMR (and the superior draw distance of playing the game on PC---don't know how far the ""actor distance"" is on the 360 for long-range sniping) and rarely have to worry about even that much stress."

EDIT: I also loved Red Faction: Guerrilla, but that's at least in part because that is one of my favorite games ever.  My least favorite series so far has to be Nicole.

The commentary is hilarious.   Note - click-attacking with phalanx units in RTW completely messes up their formation. What you want to do is to actually just move as close to the enemy as possible, in range of the spears,  facing the direction you want, WITHOUT clicking attack.   To make this process much faster - you should ""un-phalanx"" the hoplites (so they can run), get them to sprint to their attack position, then activate the phalanx position. It'll look awkward and look like your hoplites are lowering the spear onto the enemy, but the moment that happens, instant death and mayhem."

ManyATrueNerd,3b5fu0,meinherzbrennt42,2,Fri Jun 26 06:08:15 2015 UTC,"I've played it for 75, and your observation is correct---Rome 2 is a mess for tactical wargaming.  I will praise it for its strategic-level gameplay, though, which is quite well done."
ManyATrueNerd,3b5fu0,RealFoxD,2,Fri Jun 26 12:12:41 2015 UTC,"Barbarian factions are fun at first but can suffer from lack of variety later on. Rome can almost have too much variety.  Make sure you keep a check on your squalor levels, or it will likely bring your expansion to a grinding halt. I'd say go with Rome for your first play through, then maybe Egypt or the Seleucids for your second to get some idea of different tactics. Personally in the field my favourite strategy is hammer and anvil (defensive units engage the enemy and hold them in place for a while, then offensive units flank and hit them in the rear). Does a lot of damage and is devastating for enemy morale."
ManyATrueNerd,3b5fu0,Madman_Salvo,2,Fri Jun 26 11:56:52 2015 UTC,"Rome 2 suffers badly from its use of an engine that really wasn't well-designed for melee.  Shogun 2 suffered the same problem in its combat.  As AngryJoe pointed out, if you zoom in real close, you start to see that when two melee units get together, it's a blob and a mishmash because the game is resolving everything based on the overall stats of the unit.  In the original Rome (and in Medieval 2), every unit had its own hitbox, and if you zoom in real close, you can actually see individual units engaging in combat with each other.  My Rome 2 strategy has always been to attack with overwhelming force and mainly auto-resolve the actual battles unless my generalship is absolutely required to win a sticky situation.  As long as you win, the units will replenish themselves over time (with the right techs, a remarkably short time), which tends to activate the ""steamroller effect""* much sooner.  *defined as the moment in a Total War game (and in most other strategy games as well) where you have such a decisive advantage in men and materiel that no other force in the game can possibly hope to stand against you."

ManyATrueNerd,3av9ku,BLJohnFreeman,6,Tue Jun 23 20:20:09 2015 UTC,Perhaps one of the Metro games as Jon has mentioned he doesn't like horror games so I doubt he'd play something like Outlast or Amnesia.
ManyATrueNerd,3av9ku,IrradiatedUnicorn,4,Tue Jun 23 20:48:28 2015 UTC,I think the metro games are a bit too shootery for the MATN channel personally.  I do think you(Jon)/he would enjoy the book it was based upon(metro 2033).  (It feels weird talking about someone that is an active part of the conversation)
ManyATrueNerd,3av9ku,pvtanima,3,Wed Jun 24 00:14:24 2015 UTC,"I just bought the Metro Redux bundle last week and really enjoy it. 2033 gives me jump scares a lot, and it does make you feel pretty helpless too.   It's kind of scary like BioShock 1 is."

ManyATrueNerd,3av9ku,salasy,6,Tue Jun 23 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"the first Lucious is actually far better than the second, it's actually more stealth, creative and fun.  It's pretty much blood money but with satan and you play as a child"

I'll likely do a lightly edited first blind playthrough - showing most new things, but cutting out some areas I'm backtracking through, some low level looting, inventory management, etc. It will have less cut out than Kill Everything, maybe broadly in line with YOLO levels of cuts.

But if you're looking for a console to play FIFA on with your friends, i would recommend the PS4 over XBone since it has more beef in it, assuming the consoles have cross-platform play or at least FIFA does.  Also, i feel that the PS4 has better games on offer (from what i've seen Ryse was kinda meh at best for example) and most of the games will be on both, and if you like JRPG's then the PS4 is almost guaranteed to have the advantage (being a Japanese console, a lot more Japanese devs are probably willing to release games on it vs XBone)"

Like if a mod adds a restorative item will it still work? And how will it work with temporary health items like Buffout?
ManyATrueNerd,3a90mc,tonyantonio,2,Thu Jun 18 14:05:00 2015 UTC,"The way it works is by adding a player.hasperk YOLO == 0 condition for any effect that adds health or removes rads, so that if a player has the YOLO perk, the regen will not apply. So any added modded items will still restore health, but this condition could be added to them too to make the item compatible. The easier way of doing this (simply removing the add health effect) doesn't seem to work.  Any temporary health boosts will still be available, as they don't actually add any health, eg:  player has 200 health, takes buffout for +50 health, 250 total health. They take 25 damage for 225 total health. Then the buffout wears off for -50 health, so the player has 175 health left, same as if they had taken the damage without the buffout.   The only place it could be useful is if you are on really low health, take buffout and take enough damage to erase your pre-buffout health. Then you have to keep taking buffout to stop from dying."

ManyATrueNerd,3a90sd,ManyATrueNerd,3,Thu Jun 18 08:49:06 2015 UTC,OH YES! It's been a long time since I've been so excited about a Youtube video.  Glad to hear you're feeling better as well :)

ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,Stoyon,29,Wed Jun 17 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"Instead of three words summarizing the text, they could just give info about the nature of the answer, and it would be more clear.    Example: The ""I feel fine"" promt could be ""I'm fine, everything is just great. My wife is dead, my child is dead, everyone's dead and I'm the idiot who's stuck with you"" as well as ""I'm fine and so glad to see you, Cosworth"". How are we supposed to know, what's the most entertaining thing to say? Either full sentences or tags (e.g.: snide, sarcastic, funny, nice, polite, ...), which would actually be more useful than summaries."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,QT_Luna,11,Wed Jun 17 10:44:07 2015 UTC,Mass effect does this.  People are pretty blind though so this will probably end up at the bottom of the thread
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,CSGOWasp,24,Wed Jun 17 14:29:19 2015 UTC,I'm concerned that we may have ended up with a massive decrease in dialogue writing quality and options.
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,templar_,11,Wed Jun 17 10:24:08 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue is lack of control.  In the screenshot with Vaul-Tec employee, if you choose ""Good morning"" your character may say:  ""Good morning. What's going on?""  ""Good morning. It's a lovely day, isn't? Perhaps you would like some tea? We were about to eat breakfest. Please, come in.""  ""Listen pal, it's a lovely morning and I'm not really in the mood, so... <closes door>""  The point is, you'll never know what are you going to say - because it's the character talking, not you. Which may work when you have a strong character with history like, say, Geralt or Nameless One, but I doubt it will work with a blank slate ""make your own story"" Bethesda-style PC."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,Sub-Mongoloid,2,Wed Jun 17 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"I can see two ways for them to pull this one out of the fire:  One, the shorter replies mean that you're interjecting more and steering the conversation in a direction as it happens, so you're still controlling the outcome but by smaller degrees much more like how a real dialogue goes.    Or Two, that your dialog choices and tone actually change with how your character develops, since the demo only showed the first few conversations that could explain why they're generic, in the later game you may have hard bitten options, virtuous ones, or snarky quips depending on the choices you've made previously.     Of course, I'm just speculating from nowhere here so we'll have to see what unfolds come November.  Or maybe the game will get delayed because of everyone opposing the dialog and they'll have to rework it drastically before launch."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,rattmann5602,2,Wed Jun 17 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"I hope you are right, I really do. I also hope that the dialogue wheel wasn't introduced because of ""streamlining"", ""reaching out to new consumers"", ""increasing sales in console segment"" or something like this.  What I saw in F4 so far is great graphics, awesome customization options, more DYI approach, a lot of inspiration from Minecraft and rather bland dialogue. I hope I'm wrong - it was only an E3 preview after all. But having started with F1 and F2 years ago (F2 was one of these games with which I was learning English) I really hope they will have a good script."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,templar_,8,Thu Jun 18 08:50:22 2015 UTC,"Is it possible that they give so little detail because the character has a really low charisma? He is straight out of the vault, it would make sense because his level is so low."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,MuDelta,15,Wed Jun 17 12:32:27 2015 UTC,I'd like more than 4 dialogue options.
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,altiuscitiusfortius,2,Wed Jun 17 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"IIRC they gave the character 5/6 Charisma and 10 Luck, everything else was <4. There were no 'skill check' encounters during the game so I dunno how they'll function, but there's little chance that has an impact on the minimal and brusk nature of responses.  I think that either this will be the final system, and the dialogue prompts will pretty much decide the 'colour' of your reponse (which could be interesting, though with perhaps more than 4 options), or they'll roll back to the previous system once they realise it's far more indepth and descriptive, and doesn't limit each response to 4 variations."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,petenu,5,Wed Jun 17 14:50:06 2015 UTC,"This is the FO3 team not the NV team.    I feel like the dialogue writing quality and options will be the same as FO3, which sadly is about half of that in NV."

ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,chalkman,16,Wed Jun 17 11:20:32 2015 UTC,"The annoying thing is we really have no idea whats going to be said until we hear it.   More to the point, despite the ""4 choices"" we have very little actual choice in whats said. We have ""guesses"" at may be said based on 1-3 words.   I'd be totally okay with the voiced dialogue if I got to read the whole thing he would say. It's the having little actual control that annoys the piss out of me."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,Sandwich247,6,Wed Jun 17 12:12:59 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't be so quick to string up the Devs for having bad dialogue when we still have yet to see the final product. All of the examples for Fallout 3/NV are from the final products, while the example for Fallout 4 come from 30 minutes of game play showcasing, of which a small portion covered dialogue. As for the matter of being limited to four speech options; might I remind everybody that quite a few of the speech options in Fallout 3/NV had 4 or fewer choices due to not needing more than that. We should all put away our pitchforks and torches until we know a little more."
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,Mrs_Brisby,3,Wed Jun 17 20:37:44 2015 UTC,How are mods going to work? Will there be a (more text options) option?
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,RealFoxD,2,Wed Jun 17 11:16:20 2015 UTC,"Surely Bethesda wouldn't try to push out paid mods... I mean, it's just a coincidence they tried to shove that idea down our throats a mere 6 months or so before Fo4 release..... nah...  definitely coincidence."

ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,Daveaa005,2,Wed Jun 17 16:34:55 2015 UTC,That will be one of the first mods I install in addition to weapon repair and first person silent protagonist dialogue.
ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,AlcoholicCelery,12,Wed Jun 17 12:00:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why give the developer behind the game you liked before a shot at trying something new? Just keep it exactly the same forever."

ManyATrueNerd,3a577m,qew7,-1,Wed Jun 17 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"Bethesda is not my favorite game developer, and I have seen dialogue displayed like this in Mass Effect. I didn't like it nearly as much as I did in Fallout NV because what Sheperd said was different that what I read. I found voice acting to be strange because they often don't express themselves like I would expect.   I thought Fallout 3 and Skyrim were much weaker than Fallout NV because there is not much different branching in the story. In Fallout 3 there were clear good and bad guys, while in NV everyone was pretty bad."

But that's just me. Now f4's writing seemes to be even more lacking compared to f3 because of the spoken dialogue. It's like the TES progression all over again. Or like matrix 1 vs matrix 2 and 3, where story is so philosophical and interesting in the beginning, but in later parts they rather go for looks/special effects. :( Maybe I'm just too old for gaming though and should just read more classics instead."

Geralt's options are something along the lines of I'd love to but..."" and ""Very funny""  If you select ""Very funny"" Geralt scowls and says ""Fuck you""  The ""gaps"" sometimes aren't very obvious and that breaks some amount of immersion. Not so bad when you're playing a defined character like Geralt. Absolute shit when I'm playing a ""me"" character."

Its another one of those things that differentiates a RPG from a FPS."

Basically, it was a way to let every enemy drop their weapon and not have the player become even more wealthy than they already do. If they're dumping weapon condition, hopefully Bethesda really thinks about how to balance the economy so that weapon drops don't make the game too easy, at least in terms of caps.  Or, because if I don't need weapons to repair other weapons, I'll be even more inclined to sell ALL THE WEAPONS compulsively. There's nothing wrong with taking 10+ trips between a given area and the vendors to make sure I sold every single object of value, right? RIGHT?"

ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,bolsey,9,Wed Jun 17 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who made extensive use of the Repair system in New Vegas, I thought it gave another layer of depth.  Finding a bunch of weapons in bloody dreadful condition and repairing them up to sell them for a profit was a nice touch.  Then again, I hated weapon and armour degradation in Oblivion and didn't like the ""from the first shot"" weapon failure in Fallout 3 coupled with that game's repair system.  It was punishing rather than challenging.  If BGS just wants to get rid of it in their game, that's fine by me---I never thought to myself ""gee, shouldn't this break?  Wouldn't it be nice to repair it?"" in Skyrim.  Depends on the dev philosophy, and Bethesda's heavy emphasis on combat doesn't square well with a repair system like the one in Oblivion/Fallout 3."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,QT_Luna,4,Wed Jun 17 02:02:29 2015 UTC,"Degradation is useful for balancing weapons, like.. ""yeah, this thing can one-shot any NPC in the game, but you can only fire it six times before you have to make repairs.""  That said, I will not miss Fallout 3's single-use missile launchers and the virtual impossibility of finding/achieving 100% condition anything."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,thirdtotheleft,8,Wed Jun 17 04:23:47 2015 UTC,"No it was not and I certainly won't miss it. The only time it was useful, when you do a no repair run, so you are forced to switch weapons. And with all the customization going on, it's probably easier this way. Laser pistol and rifle are basically the same (the only difference is the barrel and the stock), but repairing a highly modified laser rifle with an old defective laser pistol would feel wrong, I guess."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Lonovich,6,Tue Jun 16 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"I reckon that's why all skill requirements for guns have gone too - it would have just been too annoying to gather the perks and resources to make a gun, then have the superior gun perform worse because it's now better than you are  - getting punished for making a gun that was Too Good."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Ilitarist,5,Tue Jun 16 23:19:33 2015 UTC,"I think a system where the damage of weapons was a constant, but leveling up skills (which may or may not exist) would decrease reload time, degradation, swaying, and things along those lines, would be a good balance of not being punished for having too good guns, but encouraging leveling up."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Drokash,3,Wed Jun 17 01:46:30 2015 UTC,"Weapon degradation probably had to go to be able to work with the modification system, barrel swaps and everything.  Each individual piece would have to track degradation otherwise and probably bog down that feature."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Harha,3,Wed Jun 17 04:29:05 2015 UTC,It was mostly inconvinient because you knew each shot makes your weapon weaker. Tough for perfectionists.  I prefer Diablo 2 or Dark Souls or Divinity approach: your weapon always performs good. Then when it's durability is low you get popup about it. If it gets to 0 then it's broken and you can't use this item and it costs a fortune to fix so you might as well drop it. But before that it's easy to fix. They implemented some of it in FNV where your equipment performs great even on 75% durability IIRC.  Gives you more choices. Would I continue using my great gun risking breaking it or will I switch to side arm?

Two, I noticed the minimal SPECIAL points available as well...it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if there are items/perks/a natural level progression to bring those stats more in line with previous Fallout games.  You may not start with 40 SPECIAL points, but the 12-point gap will be closed somehow...possibly and then some, considering the common Broken Steel strategy in Fallout 3 of going for Almost Perfect at level 30 and holding off grabbing SPECIAL bobbleheads until that point in the game to get all tens."

ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Dblitzer,7,Tue Jun 16 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"Some new info relating to a few of the things you talked about in the video from EB games Australia   Factions: ""Join multiple factions vying for power or go it alone, the choices are all yours.""  Perks: ""... you can choose from hundreds of Perks and develop your own playstyle."""
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Squidgyness,8,Wed Jun 17 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"With regards to factions, I don't think we can categorically judge at the minute if they will not go the new Vegas route. At the end of the gameplay you get a megaton style nuke detonation, that certainly could just be a ""small"" nuke like the megaton one but it looked big. That could be an indicator of choice in storyline, I doubt they would make you detonate it... It would be unusual if they did anyway.  Plus the whole ""just got out of a vault"" thing seems to me to be a natural way of placing you in the middle of a conflict (judging by the flaming brotherhood airship there is certainly one going on in Boston) much like new Vegas did. The fact that the character in the gameplay was attacking the brotherhood and synths (though rogue or not we don't know) suggests to me he was likely working with the institute, so an ""evil"" or at least morally grey or whatever the institute counts as paythrough looks almost certain, I foresee some android rights issues, morality, trading freedom for security etc etc, could all be very relevant to modern day issues involving scientific advancement versus personal freedom.  With regards to weapon degradation I agree I won't miss it, although a system where the mods in your gun break over time might have been ok, just removing the effect of that mod (loss of scatter on lasers for example) rather than the gun itself breaking. I can certainly see why they removed it though, it could get really annoying.  Apologies for the long post, keep up the good work :)"
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,acksed,7,Tue Jun 16 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that the character in the gameplay was attacking the brotherhood   I noticed that too, and I'm really clinging to that in hope. Hope that it wasn't just a one-off showcase.  I really want the Institute to be an interesting fleshed out faction, and the BoS involvement in the region to be interesting and complex. It's going to be really disappointing if it's the paragon Brotherhood versus the stereotypically mad science styled evil of the Institute. Which I just find trite and not compelling at all. So here's to hoping that was quite intentional to send a message about some level of in-game faction flexibility."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,Squidgyness,3,Wed Jun 17 00:25:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see where you are coming from. I would like to see a nice ""we just want science advances to help humans"" approach from the institute that masks a deeper menacing streak about their indifference for android and even non ""civilised"" human life.  A community of such ""barbarian"" humans, at least to the Institute, might be interesting. They could be based inside or outside Boston, and used as traders/pawns by the player, brotherhood or institute. Who knows, the story is really still wide open, that's why I wouldn't speculate too much about it being linear at the minute.   I'm sure the institute will be fleshed out for good or bad, they've had five plus years to think about this after all and experience to build upon. Even if that is f3 experience and not NV as MATN was hinting in the video."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,PantsBonanza,5,Wed Jun 17 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"About the power armour: the mission that lets you use it is very early. In this video where you get the laser musket and later clank around in the armour, the player levels up - to level 2. Call me no-fun, but I really hope you either go through hell to activate it, or don't get to keep it once the mission finishes. Otherwise, where's the challenge?"
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,james9883,7,Tue Jun 16 23:50:54 2015 UTC,"Could have just been for the gameplay, the ammo counter in the fallout gameplay vids was at 999 for one of the weapons I noticed, and the crafting materials for the gun mods were in the hundreds, seems like some dev console tweaks to give more ammo so I wouldn't put it past them to give themselves power armour earlier than normal to show it off without revealing a later story mission or juicier locations revealed later on in the game."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,PantsBonanza,5,Wed Jun 17 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused, I don't remember this clip from the conference. Is it from somewhere else?"

ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,RealFoxD,2,Wed Jun 17 00:25:41 2015 UTC,Oh.  Well then.  I see.
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,KingBasketCase,2,Wed Jun 17 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"The airship is going to be the BoS main base, probably.   Arthur Maxson is likely going to be leading them, with the airship being called ""Prydwen"" (right on the side of the ship) the mythical ship of Arthurian legend, and the fact that he is a descendent of the founder of the BoS. Currently, he's a ward of Lyons.   Regardless, we see the airship falling to the earth in flames. With the azure laser that looks to be shooting down on downtown boston, it's probably the player's choice to destroy the BoS, the Institute, or both.  We are shown using the BoS as allies, and blowing them up with rockets.   But of course it's clearly going to be a railroad plotline like Fallout 3.   Come on, John. It's probably going to at least be like the Stormcloaks and Imperials in Skyrim, the Bethesda game after Fallout 3. Saying you're basing this observation of a railroad plotline on the presentation is kinda off, as the presentation had the BoS as the bad guys just as often as they were shown as the good guys. You're worried because of the plot of Fallout 3, which is valid, but the trailer hinted at two distinct endings for two distinct factions.  Edit: Also, momentum wise, wouldn't it require more lift to stop an armored person from falling and then hover/rise  than to start out from standing on the ground and rising up? It's probably technically a jetpack, but I don't really know what the technical definition of a jetpack is..."
ManyATrueNerd,3a3d4v,mattinthecrown,3,Wed Jun 17 03:32:54 2015 UTC,I would love to see them develop that more fully and do a full-scale Arthurian Legend-inspired quest with lots of little referential bonuses for people familiar with the story.  Or they could get utterly silly with it and just pump it full of Monty Python references (where's the Wild Wasteland trait when you really need it?)

Aside from the things they added -and I do appreciate those, it seems like there's a decent amount they took away, and these all tend in the same direction: dumbing down the gameplay.  It seems like a Fallout 4 where there are no factions, weapons repairs, skills as we knew them, a simplified DT/DR system, and with a linear story arc where we're slated as the good-guy is definitely in play -if not likely.  And while I'd still play that game and probably even enjoy it, it just sucks that it would give back so much of what it gained from New Vegas."

But for one thing we don't know for sure a linear story is involved. No reason an institute vs brotherhood vs Bostonian story couldn't be there for example. I'm not judging on that at the minute, but if it does turn out to be linear, then I'll understand why you don't like it for that reason.  And weapon repair is such a peripheral part of the game, it's hardly dumbing it down that much, how smart do you have to be to click on the same weapon to repair? It wasn't a sophisticated or satisfying process at all."

We see the player inserting a small thing in the back, and in the HUD there's a core (reactor core?) counter with a charge percentage.  Given that it's kinda hard to carry a power armor around (unless it's powered up and you're inside) my guess is that there will be mecha sections where you get to use it, and after it's done you send it back to the airship or vertibird or whatever it is. Not sure whether I like this or not.  It's quite obviously all speculation, of course."

It might be a little sad not to be able to wander round in it, but for those wanting a little more difficulty, it might be really fun. Those deathclaws seem an awful threat without it..."

ManyATrueNerd,3a2cyq,xiMbd03u1,3,Tue Jun 16 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Blood Money is, to me, the ultimate Hitman game. Absolution would have been a much better game if it hadn't been part of the Hitman franchise. It was fine, but it wasn't a Hitman game. To me, the essence of a Hitman game is that you are presented with an area, and your job is to explore the area until you find a way to accomplish the goals (usually, an assassination). The set must be self-contained in order to allow for the type of open-ended play that defines the series. Some levels on Absolution were closer to this than others, but many were not.  What finally made me put down Absolution was the level where you have to have a shootout contest with the female gunslinger. First of all, I am not playing Hitman because I want to play FPS-style targetting games. And as near as I can tell, you cannot proceed in the story until you beat her at the contest. Second of all, THERE ARE NO OTHER INTERACTIVE CHARACTERS IN A HITMAN GAME EXCEPT IN CUT SCENES. In a Hitman game, there is Agent 47, there is the target(s), and there are unnamed strangers. The fact that the only other characters in the game who have a name or a unique personality are 47's targets really shapes your outlook when you play. This is how 47 sees the world. Regular people are little more than hangers, carrying around disguises for 47 to use.  PS: Blood Money is one of the only games that I have 100% completion on."

My hope is that Andromeda is going to be a more frontier/western oriented space opera (which would be fitting, considering the term's origin in ""horse opera""). Instead of relying on formal political/military systems to accomplish your goal, having to deal with largely self-governing factions a la New Vegas would be an interesting spin and potentially give more value to companions.   In the first ME having Liara, the daughter of a major Asari political leader does almost nothing to earning the Asari councillor trust, but perhaps a faction companion might play an important role in getting an Andromeda faction on your side."

ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,forgodandthequeen,9,Mon Jun 15 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"I saw one screenshot where you could see ""Bobblehead: Barter"" or something, so perks could possibly be merged into one thing and I'm all for that.  I for one liked Skyrim's perk trees, especially with the modded ones and I don't understand how some people treat that system like some awful, boring oversimplification and Fallout's like super advanced for geniuses only.  Instead of increasing a skill from 31 to 34 you bump it a whole level, possibly unlocking new side perks and feel a tangible improvement.

More perks could be gated behind SPECIAL requirements.  I must admit I never did much crafting in Fallout, apart from unique stuff like Rock-It Launcher, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Railway Rifle etc. you could easily find/buy something as good/even better.   This looks promising however, they'd have to limit the availability of pre-made weaponry though. The fact you don't need a very specific piece of junk as building component, instead they're grouped into categories should make it more manageable.

ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,PelvicThrustoid,4,Tue Jun 16 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure how exactly skills fit into the game as of yet, but I think they exist in some capacity. There was a brief clip when they were showing off building where we saw a bobblehead stand with the 7 slots for the S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats, and then 13 more slots (we had 13 different skills in Fallout 3 and NV, I'm not sure about the earlier ones). The player's crosshair also went over a barter bobblehead, so I'm sure the 13 other slots are for the 13 skills. I also don't think that the leveling system works like it did in Skyrim, at least not in the sense that using a skill levels it up because we can see the player gaining plain old experience from killing enemies in the demo. Now I do think it's possible that you're right about how perks might play out, being the focus of your progression as you level up, and that the bobbleheads would grant bonus perks for whatever skill they were tied to. Your theories did make me feel much better about the prospect of skill points being removed as they existed before, since I think your ideas sound like a way to potentially revamp the progression and tighten up some sloppy parts from the old system. Either way I'm optimistic about the character progression in the game.  Also, I'm really happy about the change to the effects of Intelligence. The easiest comparison I can think of is when they stopped including perks in Call of Duty like Stopping Power (increased damage) and Juggernaut (increased health). They're too easy of choices. I like the idea of freeing us up to not have super high intelligence without making us feel like we're handicapping ourselves. I think that increased experience is a more appropriate benefit from intelligence without making it necessarily essential."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,RealFoxD,4,Mon Jun 15 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"If they haven't taken out skill points, I won't mind - simplified character build vs massively more complex crafting seems a fair trade.  But, yeah, who knows, the skill points could be hidden in the perks tab/tree."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,edichez,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:55:05 2015 UTC,"If it's anything like Skyrim, that'll be exactly where the skill points are hidden, and you'll only see them as you go into the perk tree.  Then again, Fallout is not The Elder Scrolls, so I don't see where skill points would even fit into the system they seem to have built.

ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,Squidgyness,3,Tue Jun 16 07:40:29 2015 UTC,The first thing that came to mind when you mentioned perk requirements for me was traits. Now it's not like Bethesda to trap you into gameplay from choices you make all the way at the beginning but it does bear mentioning that traits might reemerge and have an effect on the game and the character.
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,Squidgyness,3,Mon Jun 15 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"I too think that they have removed skills, or rather integrated skills into other aspects of the game, most likely perks. I've always loved perks more than skills anyway, I know a lot of people like the rpg aspects of bumping numbers up but I just loved picking random and/or hilarious perks to experiment with (bloody mess anyone?) so I'd welcome perks that unlock crazy weapons as seen in the crafting video for example or crazy/hidden conversation options in the case of speech perks.   As for the bobble heads that people keep mentioning, I think they will be for passive bonuses like damage increase or price decrease (which would be fine) or something a bit more juicier like unlocking more/crazier weapons, unique perks etc. I'd like the second one better since getting the bobble heads was immensely enjoyable for me in fallout three. I'm just glad they are back, I really missed them in new Vegas. Keep up the good work MATN! :)"
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,thirdtotheleft,5,Mon Jun 15 22:53:04 2015 UTC,Even if the effect were the same - putting 18 points into energy weapons is less satisfying that picking the perk 'I Am The God of Lasers'
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,Squidgyness,3,Mon Jun 15 22:56:21 2015 UTC,"Haha totally. I always loved those nutty weapon perks, recently for example I took the energy weapon perk in new Vegas that makes enemies blow up in a green ball of energy. Perks like that really give a tangible sense of power to any playthrough. So often I put the same points into skills (lock pick, speech, science and one or two combat skills) but it's the perks that determine what personality I am and what route my playthrough ultimately takes.  Plus who doesn't want to eat the corpses of their enemies?"
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,SolarMechanic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm sort of the opposite. Being told I'm a laser cadet or whatever feels less impactful than actually increasing my skills to the point where I actually feel like I'm getting more effective with laser guns. Plus, having to pick between a more traditional perk, like say Mysterious Stranger or Light Step, or increasing a skill, presents a choice that would personally disencourage me from taking a less useful but more ""fun"" one like Cannibal, or Infiltrator. I'm still cautiously optimistic, though. Even if their levelling system is totally borked, I'm sure that'll be one of the first mods made, right after the one that lets you play the original Fallout through your in game pip boy."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,bradthompson7175,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for a system where you get 1 skill and 1 character perk on levelling, and get a point to distribute to SPECIAL (which appears to go to more than 10, see the video where he can still put luck up even after putting it to 10). There were 70 little perk pictures on the poster in the garage on the reveal screenshot, to unlock anywhere near that amount 1 perk per level wouldn't do it unless it goes to level 50, in which case you could start experimenting later on after you have the more important ""skill"" perks like gun nut or science!.  This is all speculation of course, but that seems like a sensible way to do it to me. I'm sure I will enjoy it. I'll just have to remember not to expect the exact same systems as before. Doesn't mean it will be worse though! :)"
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,RealFoxD,3,Tue Jun 16 11:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're dead on with them removing the skill points to make perk progression less of a grind. Anyone who had to get their crafting skills up in Skyrim remembers crafting hundreds of bloody daggers just to move up their points to get the next perk to make better stuff, and with Fallout now having crafting as a central mechanic I'm glad that process has been smoothed.   I doubt I could have dealt with having to sell 50 molerat leather elbowpads every 10 minutes to clear out my inventory."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,ChetBenning,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:31 2015 UTC,"The problem with Skyrim crafting was the fact that there was no use to grind stuff out.  It just felt like you were doing it to level up the skill rather than to get better armor and weapons or to actually be making the stuff for something.  Hell, even a shoed in ""This will go to faction x"" line with extra money would have been worth it.  But no, grind time.  Meanwhile, pickpocket was the easiest skill in the game."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,RealFoxD,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"If Skyrim had a supply-and-demand based economy, after my player arrived to grind skill for awhile, they'd be giving away a free set of enchanted leather bracers with every bottle of Nord Mead at the Bannered Mare."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,pinglebon,3,Tue Jun 16 07:42:08 2015 UTC,"Not making a prediction, just an observation. Wolfenstein, another Bethesda published game, had perks that were action-based, e.g. kill X enemies with headshots to get steadier aim or whatever. So there is a possible alternative to a sequential tree."
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,Sheikah_Benji,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:04:52 2015 UTC,"There's a New Vegas mod that does that---basically moves some of the level-up perks off the level menu and ties them to completing challenges (of course, since it's a mod rather than an integrated feature of the game itself, the implementation's a bit clunky in places, but it really feels like it's part of the Courier's natural progression as he experiences more of the Mojave.)"
ManyATrueNerd,39yq6f,paleoreef103,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:34:26 2015 UTC,So that would move us a little closer to the Skyrim system but without grind - cold be interesting. Fallout's always had achievements for XP for doing stuff like that - would be nice if they took a more prominent role.

Such as repeatedly casting certain spells or sneaking into a wall to level sneak. I get the feeling that you'll be able to grind sneak the same way as in Skyrim. As for the other skills, I'm not sure. I guess if there are people tagged as essential you could keep attacking them in order to raise your weapons skill."

I don't think they usually come with controllers, but I guess that depends where it's bought from"

Edit: Party pooper scepticism:   They look to have folded skills and perks together into a ""perk chart"". Mass Effect-style dialogue options where you pick one of four. Five seems right out. Edit: Though it does seem to correspond more to the dialogue, so you'll pick 'Let's go' and he'll say, ""Let's go, boy."" Intelligence is no longer the one true stat, as it only seems to affect the amount of experience gained Charisma more directly affects dialogue: ""It affects your success to persuade in dialogue and prices when you barter."" Greater Luck increases your chance of finding better stuff and mentions ""recharge rate for critical hits"" They have a sort function on the inventory screen You can play games and holotapes on the PipBoy, kind of like System Shock 2's MFD VATS no longer pauses combat, just slows it right down; Action Points seem to be used for making critical hits at will Sprint function confirmed, runs off Endurance Your standard pipe rifle is a little less powerful than F3's Hunting rifle Building mode (awesome) gives us our first perk requirement - Science! Rank 1 for creating a laser turret. So the main skills have become perks with ranks instead of numbers? Modding weapons (also awesome); some mods require ranks in Gun Nut.

ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,thirdtotheleft,16,Mon Jun 15 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"From what we saw today, it looks to be absolutely god damn outstanding in every way. But then, that's what I thought of Skyrim pre-release, and that game was a colossal disappointment for me, so I'll try to keep my excitement in check. No matter how it turns out, I know I'll be spending a few hundred hours in Fallout 4!  Notable Feature Recap: 1: Tutorial is set shortly before the bombs fall, and follows a couple who have a swaddled baby and a Mr. Handy butler, living in suburbia 2: Choose to play as the man or the woman, and literally sculpt the couple's faces in the bathroom mirror. The baby will take on the traits of your couple. 3: SPECIAL returns, and you choose your stats after a Vault-Tec employee shows up at your door to reserve your spots in the Vault. Point allotment looks the same, but default points begin at 1 instead of 5. Endurance effects how long you can sprint(!), Intelligence effects your experience gain(!), Perception increases your chance to hit in VATS, Luck has a new critical move ability in VATS, and Charisma now has an effect in bartering prices. Those are new notable things we can gleam. 4: Mr. Handy will speak your name out loud if it is one of the 1,000 most popular names for the two genders 5: Player dialogue is fully voiced (apparently 13,000 lines per gender, revealed post-show), and real time akin to Skyrim. Can be viewed in first person, or cinematic style in third person (see your face animate!). Dialogue choices are chosen very similar to Mass Effect, including the fact that your choices are from simplified summaries of what your character will actually say... :( 6: Early Plot Spoilers!! Hover here for Spoilers  7: The dog is flippin' adorable, yo. You can direct orders at it, telling it to go and wait at certain spots, retrieve objects, the works. At one point the dog was seen biting a Feral Ghoul in the leg, causing it to fall on its back as the dog continued to bite into the leg. It was a very smooth animation, so we can guess that the Dog will be very handy at distracting foes. 8: Mole-Rats popped out from underground, smaller than they were in FO3. VATS is shown! Instead of stopped time, time is now simply slowed, and the % chance to hit actively changes based on the positions of the enemies. Seems to still use the same old AP system. Eye and Groin shots don't return (at least for Mole-Rats). Most notable here is that there's a long bar of points called Critical, and it seems you can spend the entire bar to fire off a guaranteed critical hit! Earlier, the LUCK attribute was said to increase how fast this bar refilled, so it seems to be a time-based thing. I love it so much!  Hope you're wearing your brown pants, because this is where things go batshit insane.  9: Literally every item in the environment can be instantly broken down to base supplies on the spot. From collectable objects like wrenches and scrap to scenery like heaps of old tires and chairs. At one point, the player up-and-vanished an entire flippin' house in the blink of an eye for parts, leaving the underlying stone foundation! 10: The player then proceeded to custom build his own house, in a shoddy tree-fort-like wood plank style. Then he went and placed some chairs and beds. Camera then panned out to an overview of the house, and a timelapse happened where the base steadily became fancier, larger, more advanced. 11: Set up custom electronics and generators. Wire lights and turrets and other stuff together to make logic gates, turn stuff on and off with levers. It is stated that raiders will come to eventually attack your settlements, so you'd best prepare and defend! 12: NPCs can come and live at your bases, and you can set up caravan routes between your various bases. It is stated that merchants that live with you will offer the best equipment. 13: It appears that there are no fixed locations for potential bases. There were shots of bases all over, including on a beach, built over water. 14: Final shot of this segment was a giant pixel-art Vault Boy giving the thumbs up, with spouts of flame shooting off from the side.  Yes, we did in fact just go full Minecraft.  15: There is full weapon customization, and by full I mean thousands upon thousands of different combinations. Create your own weapon mods from scavenging the environment, and cobble together weapons of various types. We saw a simple laser pistol steadily transform into an enormous laser sniper rifle, a baseball bat change from wood to metal and then finally have some nasty saw-blades bolted in, and more. Damage, accuracy, weight, and two other stats I forget change on the fly as you modify weapons, and the name changes as well to reflect the type of weapon you have. Weapon customizing is done at work benches. 16: Clothing is now in five parts! Chest, legs, two different arms, and head. I didn't quite catch if there was armor customizing in the same vein as weapons, and that seems unlikely. 17: Make your own Power Armor!! You can custom choose the five different parts of your Power Armor, each part offering their own stats and abilities. We saw one example of Armor offer us a god damn jetpack with cool-ass green flames. Yeah! There were quite a lot of options here! The power armor stood 7-8 feet tall and we entered it like it was an Iron Man suit, so they're really capturing the nature of power armor here. While in the power armor, we have a custom HUD showing what appears to be the condition of the various parts of the suit, as well as various gauges displaying HP, Rads, our compass, our AP, and something called ""CORE"". This complete UI overhaul here leads me to believe that we may be unable to use our pip-boy while in the suit!?  18: Combat is still gloriously gory. Head explosions and severed limbs galore, complete with blood sprays and giblets! 19: A Deathclaw is seen crawling up from a sewer in the middle of downtown ruined Boston. It picks the player up, stretches its claws, and, uh, violently kills us. 20: There's a bit where we throw down a red smoke grenade, calling a Vertibird to that location. We are then seen flying in the side of the vertibird, manning a turret. Heck. Yes. While flying, there were also ""Land"" and ""Jump"" prompts! Our dog was riding with us, of course. 21: There's a shot of us using a VATS guaranteed Critical use with a Fatman on a poor raider in a quarry. That is all. 22: A supermutant is shot by us, and the armor on his chest falls off. Seems like some enemies will need to be chipped away first before killing 'em! 23: Grenades can be thrown at any time, as we briefly see the player throw one and then immediately resume shooting with what appears to be a 10mm SMG. We also see a grenade ammo counter, independent of the SMG's ammo counter. 24: A pristine white humanoid robot named ""Synth Strider"" is seen shooting us with an energy weapon that shoots blue bolts of plasma. Very interesting. The robot looks way more sleek and futuristic than something like securitrons. 25: A small caged arena is shown with two NPCs fighting. Perhaps there's an arena in the game for us to play and bet on! 26: A feral ghoul is peppered by 10mm SMG bullets, and stumbles and staggers at each bullet. Looks like we have enemies that don't no-sell bullets anymore.  A giant mosquito lands on our point of view and sucks our blood. A sledge-hammer is swung and makes a guy explode in a Bloody Mess. 27: The Rock-It-Launcher is back, this time named the ""Junk-Jet"". We see it use a teddy bear to decapitate some dude. We also saw previously a Junk-Jet get some sweet mods applied to it earlier. 28: We see the player take a VATS shot with a rocket launcher at a Brotherhood of Steel Initiate. It's a direct hit, takes off a mere 15% of his HP, and two pieces of armor go flying off. The implications of every single bit of this are staggering. Are the Brotherhood our enemies!!? 29: POTENTIAL SEVERE STORY SPOILERS! Hover here for truth. Viewer beware. 30: The new pip-boy is shown off, and it looks great! Very different from the FO3/FNV pip-boy, in that it is more vertical-based than horizontal. You can see a 3D model of the selected item, like in Skyrim, and you can even play cassete tapes. We also saw us flex our arm around to get any angle of view we wanted, and we also played a Donkey Kong ripoff game starring Vault Boy... Yes, you read that right, we can play games on our pip-boy.  The game launches November 10th, 2015."

ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,ZebraShark,4,Mon Jun 15 12:11:50 2015 UTC,"I'm probably a lot more mixed in my reaction than most people here.  The gameplay and crafting elements look great as do the graphics. My main gripes are:   Voiced character and dialogue wheel - feel like it is going to limit not only my dialogue choices but tone and intonation. It works in Mass Effect but I play that game for different reasons to Fallout. Lack of skills - it appears skills have gone and been replaced by perks which is a bit sad but I can live with it. Forced background - my character now is certainly a married man/woman who lived before the war and had a kid. This limits me from playing as a homosexual, unmarried and all other things I'd like.   All in all, I'm still looking forward to playing Fallout 4. I think I just hoped for a sequel to New Vegas in terms of style, gameplay and focus...while what we have got is a sequel to FO3."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Sub-Mongoloid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:20:33 2015 UTC,Is lack of skills confirmed?
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,RealFoxD,2,Mon Jun 15 12:47:32 2015 UTC,Not confirmed but seems likely now. Seems to be replaced by a levelling system.  Video explains better than I can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQoAf0WoNzA
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,ZebraShark,2,Mon Jun 15 12:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm strangely okay with this, if your abilities are to be determined by your Specials and perks then it basically means that they've streamlined the system and made it a more natural progression of character growth.  It will be very nice if this is used to give specific areas more replay value, i.e. a single terminal may have two or three levels of locking so coming at it as a low level unlocks a safe, later you could turn off turrets, and finally unlock a door to a whole new area."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,RealFoxD,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:50:40 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 didn't have any setups to play as a canonically homosexual character either.  Truthfully, after Skyrim's utterly naff ""marriage"" system, I'd rather Bethesda's writers just stay as far away from human relationships as possible."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,ZebraShark,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:08:00 2015 UTC,True but I felt it was a welcome addition in New Vegas. Slight step backwards which is annoying. Not the end of the world but a minor gripe.
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Zukw,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:20:29 2015 UTC,"I felt like it worked in New Vegas because their writers are top-notch.  I can count on no hands the number of times I've actually liked the writing in a Bethesda Game Studios title---those games (TES, Fallout 3) are all about the gameplay and world exploration for me."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Homertron23,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:23:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I did a post a while back on /r/falloutlore and one of the two big distinctions between FO3 and FNV is exploration vs. kingmaking.  Personally, I prefer the latter to exploration as I felt FO3's world never felt that responsive to my actions though I believe this is on purpose (for reasons that are too long to explain here).   I think with FO4 Bethesda are very interested in using the main quest line to tell a story which is why your character may be a bit more limited than normal."

ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,alephenon,2,Mon Jun 15 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"The jet pack, oh my god that jet pack. This is going to be the greatest game of all time.   They showed a ton of new enemy types and a few old ones. Brotherhood initiates, several types of supermutants, SYNTHS, raiders, all that good stuff.  They showed the player both getting on a vertibird and shooting one down. Hopefully this means you can choose to side with the faction that has them (seemingly brotherhood) or fight against them.  Overall, OH MY GOD FALLOUT 4 IS COMING OUT IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS I'M GOING INTO STASIS UNTIL THEN BYE."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Electric999999,4,Mon Jun 15 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"Personal summary: One step forward, two steps back."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Maschinengewehr,3,Mon Jun 15 14:14:04 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate?
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,alephenon,5,Mon Jun 15 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"One step forward: The creation and customization options, if they are as good as they appear, are wonderful and very welcome, even if I'm 99% sure that their inspiration for the whole settlement and raider attacks thing was the Skyrim mod that did the same thing.  Two steps back: The move towards a voice-acted protagonist kills tons of player choice and roleplaying opportunities. For a company supposedly obsessed with player choice, Bethesda had the opportunity to crib from Obsidian's example of how to do a silent protagonist right, and they completely failed to do so. The new dialogue system is going to be miserable for modders to work around, and is a huge missed opportunity.  It's going to be good, and the E3 videos mean I'm okay with preordering, but I'm sick of Bethesda turning out ""good enough"" games, and the way they've completely missed the opportunity to learn from New Vegas leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,alephenon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"You missed the fact they merged skills and perks, that's a huge step in the wrong direction."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,NukaCooler,3,Mon Jun 15 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Did they? I must have missed that.  I disagree, while getting rid of skills may end up making the game shallow and shit, I think that it could help to streamline the system and make it less vulnerable to the classic min/max abuse that the skill system suffered. For example, when did you ever put points into survival in F:NV? But if you wanted to say, craft anti-venom, you had to, despite having a high INT. This meant that no one ever crafted anti-venom.   Honestly, as long as they have a complex perk system and keep SPECIAL, this will be a step toward making more viable builds."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Grandpa_Edd,2,Mon Jun 15 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think the skill system was exactly perfect anyway. I'm open to them changing stuff, to make the game a bit more interesting and maybe even better."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Electric999999,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:17:52 2015 UTC,"I put points into Survival, because you needed it to craft interesting items. Removing skills doesn't ""make more viable builds,"" it's one step closer to making more builds the same, and that's not good."

ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Sunny_Shiny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"On the building aspect (and more-so the town management):  This feature gives a lot of opportunities when you think about it.  It's been said that you can attract people to your settlement, traders (with powerful weapons) have been said and things like farmers and guards are obvious other possibilities. You can set up defenses against attacks from raiders and most likely some violent beasties.  You can even send caravans between your own (and maybe even other npc) settlements. There might even be some quests centered around your little patch of heaven.  These are (mostly) things said in the presentation. Now for the pure speculation.  I think you will be able to shape your settlement into certain types of communities: You might have farmers and scavengers to keep you going, maybe you can create a fortified bastion to keep your people safe with many guards, become a small arms dealing operation or maybe you allow raiders into your town and have them use it as a base of operation for a fee.  This is a way the karma system might come back into play, in New Vegas it only changed what people said to you when meeting you and it served as a (slightly broken) saint/asshole-meter. Apart from that nothing special, factions were more important.  A good person might start a place where you can come when you are sick or injured and try to teach medicine so that people can help each other. You might start a ghoul (or android) sanctuary.  But it wouldn't be Fallout if you couldn't be an utter bastard, with low karma you might attract some other type of people. People like harmful drug dealers might see an opportunity in your town.   Maybe one day a slaver might even come along with a business deal for you, your town might become Fallout 4's very own Paradise Falls.  There are many possibilities that could make this feature great."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Fadman_Loki,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"There are also opportunities for it to be massively problematic as well, I'm hoping their engine can handle all they say it can and be relatively glitch free.  They also said that it was an entirely optional aspect of the game and I really hope that's the case as constant settlement management and defense against raiders would get old fast if you were trying to run quests.  On the same line it was mentioned that attracting merchants would give you access to better items and there needs to be a balanced aspect to that for players who want to be a lone wanderer."
ManyATrueNerd,39vgso,Electric999999,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:06:28 2015 UTC,Because they said it was entirely optional I'm pretty sure that it won't be as extensive as my hopeful speculations entail.  As for it being relatively glitch free... Well the track record isn't great for that.

That game was proof of concept that players can be trusted to embrace a well-built game system that allows them to create whatever their imagination desires, and it's entirely possible that the younger end of the gaming demographic is going to expect that as a feature in every game they play because their formative gaming years were spent mastering those systems.  Plus, the most popular mods on the Nexus for just about every TES or Fallout game since Oblivion have been the ones that added player control over the content, and you've gotta figure Bethesda took the hint."

ManyATrueNerd,39tn9y,Qwarr,8,Tue Jun 16 00:24:19 2015 UTC,"Something I love in this video. At the start, Jon sounds like, well, crap. Which is, you know, allowed. Having the flu sucks. But as the video goes on, he slowly sounds better and better. At the end, he sounds great, barely ill at all. Just shows how doing something you enjoy can make you feel better for a bit."

ManyATrueNerd,39tn9y,mynumberistwentynine,2,Mon Jun 15 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm quite looking forward to FO4, but I'm actually very, very skeptical about its ability to unseat New Vegas.  Fallout 3 wasn't even my Game of the Year for the year it came out (2008)---that was Mount&Blade.  Skyrim was very good for the most part, and great in places, but as an overall experience it's probably skulking somewhere on the fringes of the top five, maybe top ten, but it never seriously challenged for the top spot.  Given that pedigree, I'm predicting Fallout 4 to be very good, and I grew up in Boston so I'm probably going to have more than a few moments where I'm awestruck at how they rendered my hometown (I had a squee-with-delight moment at seeing Fenway Park basically turned into Megaton North in the trailer)...  ...but New Vegas was such a transcendently excellent experience, so wonderfully well-written, its world built as if to answer the question of what Fallout 1 and 2 would have been had they come out in 2010 rather than 1997-98, and the voice performances of the principal NPCs so utterly delightful (Dave Foley as Yes Man is my favourite game character acting performance ever, surpassing Erik Dellums as Three Dog)...  ...I mean, I could write a full-length article about why FONV is the greatest game ever made.  Fallout 4 is going to have a massive uphill climb to get to the summit of that particular mountain."
ManyATrueNerd,39tn9y,RealFoxD,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, I could write a full-length article about why FONV is the greatest game ever made.   If you did I'd likely be nodding my head throughout as I read it. While I quite liked and enjoyed FO3, I put ridiculous hours into NV. More than any other game I've ever played without a doubt.    (Dave Foley as Yes Man is my favourite game character acting performance ever, surpassing Erik Dellums as Three Dog)   Agreed here as well. People are so hype for Three Dog, but...in all honesty I found him meh in FO3. Yes Man on the other hand, in one word - spectacular.  FO4 has it's work cut out for it, but dammit - it seems to have the tools to do it. We'll see of course. I only have one worry so far."
ManyATrueNerd,39tn9y,Stumpy3196,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"Nothing against Erik Dellums---Three Dog and Galaxy News Radio are about the only reasons I come back to the otherwise inferior Fallout 3.  When I played Skyrim and did the Dark Brotherhood questline, I was delighted to find that Three Dog had been turned into a Redguard quest giver in the sanctuary, although that's not quite as enduring a character since my characters tend to be the ""good guy"" in that game and as such I tend to put an arrow between the eyes of Astrid in order to get the assassins off my ass for my accidental murders (or the murder of evil characters who get the DB after me when I kill them on principle.)"

(Copy-Paste I wrote on the Youtube Comments):  From what I understand from the Blimps; the first mention in Franchise would be from some backstory in Fallout: Tactics. To cut a long-story short, a sub-faction of the Brotherhood (which wanted to share their technology with the rest of the Wastes a la like The Citadel Brotherhood) were sent Eastwards via Blimps. It's assumed there's at least something like 3 Blimps, the main one was destroyed in a Storm, the second damaged (and landing in Chicago; near the events of Fallout: Tactics), with the third landing in unknown territory. This third (and the Brotherhood with it) is assumed to have made the journey to the East (Passing through Pittsburg) and making it's way to the Capital Wasteland.  My guess is that the blimp seen here is either the Second (Damaged, but later repaired and utilised by The Institute), or the Third (Condition Unknown, but possibly modified for Weaponised purposes) This is only a shot in the dark, and can only evidence through guess-work and the Intro from Fallout: Tactics."

Should youtubers have so much influence, and do you consider it when playing small games like Curious Expedition?"
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,PatPatTheMarauder,18,Fri Jun 12 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"Darn you for asking hard questions I can't mash out a flippant answer to!  So, 'should' is an odd way to look at it. Nobody 'should' or 'shouldn't' have influence, because influence is just the fact that lots of people have individually chosen to trust and listen to you. If loads of people continue to do so, yes, you should, I suppose.  In that regard, I'd rather YouTubers had the influence, and not because I am one. I think YouTubers have generally proved to fairly good at self-policing, being transparent with what is and isn't sponsored, being very open to calling out BS in the industry and each other, and generally being brutally honest when it might be more politically expedient to stay quiet."

Any plans to quit?  Suggestion: There's an underrated game called The Void that I played and loved but which I am apparently the only person who played, because nobody else has heard of this thing. To copy and paste from the Wiki summary:   ""The player takes on the role of a lost soul that accidentally lingers in a place called ""the Void"" before meeting its absolute death. The Void is a purgatory-like place, in which the most valuable thing is Color, a liquid that represents lifeforce. Color is scarce, and the void's inhabitants are plagued by famine. These inhabitants are beautiful naked Sisters and monstrously deformed Brothers; two conflicting factions that the player must interact with. Color is a universal resource in the game — it functions as the player's health, armor, stats and ammo.""

ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Sandwich247,3,Fri Jun 12 23:30:59 2015 UTC,"My favourite Why Not Wednesday was Binary Domain.  The one in which you were very skeptical going in, and by the end of the video you realized that you loved it."

Give them access to VR Pods that allow them to experience an amazing innovative experience called Semi-Death.

ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Jedizora,39,Fri Jun 12 22:01:51 2015 UTC,Because she's French.
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,ignotussomnium,12,Fri Jun 12 22:04:17 2015 UTC,Is she? Or is she French Polynesian and hiding it from you?
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Jedizora,24,Fri Jun 12 22:08:59 2015 UTC,Just checked. She's not.
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,DubiousBeak,20,Fri Jun 12 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"""Just checked""?  Does she have a label that says ""Fabriqué en France"" and not ""en Tahiti"" or something?"
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Daepilin,9,Fri Jun 12 22:36:00 2015 UTC,It's standard issue.
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,thirdtotheleft,2,Fri Jun 12 23:30:17 2015 UTC,Does that mean that you checked if she is French Polynesian or if she was hiding it from you?
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,JinxxL,8,Sat Jun 13 19:32:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, I was wondering whether she was French and speaks great English, or whether she was English and speaks great French."

ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Stoyon,9,Fri Jun 12 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"No, but I want to - it's one of those things, when you're 3 games behind on a finished trilogy, it's a BIG undertaking to start it. Plus, do people want to see a blind playthrough of that series when Game 1 is so old now...? Not sure..."
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Ginsoakedboy21,3,Fri Jun 12 21:47:22 2015 UTC,Personally I find it a lot of fun watching people go through something that I'm familiar with for the first time. Everyone experiences media differently and it's cool to see that happen.
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,NeighImACarrot,2,Fri Jun 12 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see it. They are all longer games, especially if you complete all the sidequests, but it's a very fun game, and a blind playthrough would be awesome. Easily in my top 5 favorite series."
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,flipflp,2,Fri Jun 12 21:52:30 2015 UTC,"Ditto this. I think it would be fantastic to see a blind play through, even if just for Dragon Age: Origins."

ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,TheColdTurtle,3,Fri Jun 12 21:49:46 2015 UTC,What do you think about MGSV having micro-transactions? Do you think it would ruin the game and everything 'Metal Gear Solid' about it?
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,TheColdTurtle,9,Fri Jun 12 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"Don't really mind. Never been a fan of the series. Played The Twin Snakes - thought it was awful. Genuinely comically bad. Like so bad, I half wondered it was made as a joke, like being bad was its point."
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,Fadman_Loki,8,Fri Jun 12 21:53:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you about The Twin Snakes being abysmally awful, i would recommend playing Snake Eater though, if you ever get the chance to, since it has survival aspects, a great (If overly played out) story. I wouldn't judge MGS by The Twin Snakes, but then again i have played every game in the series so my opinion is definitely bias towards it and people have different tastes :)"
ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,DRDS1,3,Fri Jun 12 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most people think Twin Snakes is an inferior version compared to the original MGS. It can be found on eBay for relatively cheap, like most listings are under twenty euro, so they should be under like fifteen pounds most of the time. Same for amazon.  MGS1 on the PS1 is great. I assume that you'd either have the original PS1 or a PS2 (since you don't have PS3) if i remember correctly from you listing your owned consoles.  Twin Snakes changes the whole gameplay style of the game, and it wasn't originally designed with the MGS2 style system in mind."

I first experienced Fallout 3 kill everything and have watched most of the Fallout runs through a time or two. I just got Fallout 3 and New Vegas recent on Humble Bundle because I've never actually played either. Problem is, the New Vegas YOLO run has me afraid of my own shadow and I think I'm doing it wrong.  What is your suggestion for a brand new Fallout 3 or New Vegas player that hasn't seen the game played through in its entirety with odd rule sets? Either in character setup and/or direction to experience the game fresh."

ManyATrueNerd,39mwae,paperandcloth,2,Fri Jun 12 23:16:46 2015 UTC,"Jon said ""Go explore"", and I agree, but remember about New Vegas that it's much more static than Fallout 3 is...part of ""go explore"" is ""go find out where you just plain aren't supposed to go in the earlygame""---you'll die a few times, don't get frustrated.  Also, my preferred SPECIAL stats, in order: 5-6-7-1-10-5-6.  Use as guide."

ManyATrueNerd,392r2s,bluegreenwookie,4,Tue Jun 9 03:38:51 2015 UTC,"Also there is a point to the broach. It makes no difference to the ending but it's a bit of subtle story telling.  Part of the point they make is that your choices don't really matter. Your choices are an illusion. And this is the same with the broach.  You say you pick the bird because she just escaped from a cage right? But a bird was her jailer. The bird was the very thing keeping her trapped.  By picking the bird, you are picking the cage. and by picking the cage, you are picking the cage."
ManyATrueNerd,392r2s,Dinosaur802,7,Tue Jun 9 04:54:55 2015 UTC,"On the topic of the brooch - I read somewhere on r/bioshock that even though the choice makes no difference at all, there's something kind of cool and twisted about it. Basically, most players would choose the bird over the cage just like you (and I) did because ""she's free and not in her prison (cage) anymore!"". However, the theory states that the bird actually represents Songbird, who keeps her imprisoned and keeps her in her place, while the cage actually represents her freedom because that's where birds are kept on top of the fact that later in the game the cage represents ""CAGE"" - as in, the musical notes that control Songbird, and therefore let Elizabeth be free.  Random side note...even though this game is easily in my top 5 games of all time, I had a disturbing thought which kind of ruined the immersion for me at least slightly: if they are so high up in the air, how are they breathing? Wouldn't oxygen levels be stupidly low that high above the clouds?"

ManyATrueNerd,392r2s,serialphreak,2,Tue Jun 9 10:11:17 2015 UTC,I don't know. Maybe. They took the voice acting pretty seriously in that game. I've heard that they had Troy Baker say a bunch of nasty things to Courtney Draper before doing certain emotional parts so there'd be real pain in Elizabeths voice. There aren't really many funny or joke parts in the game as far as I can remember. The tone is pretty serious throughout. Maybe we just have dirty minds.

Dishonored 2 would be kinda cool, but to me it felt that they more or less wrapped up everything at the end if the first game. Sure, they could just as easily make a sequel/continuation, but to me it would just feel like it was out of a ""desperation/we want money"" mindset. And while the internet will likely strike me down, I've never actually played a Doom game. I've been told it was/is like a better, more combat-focused Wolfenstein, and formed my opinions from there."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,ManyATrueNerd,29,Sun Jun 7 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"I told you about spears, Jon, I WARNED you about them spears.    I felt so bad when I saw your mine lay out.

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,2,Sun Jun 7 20:51:24 2015 UTC,He's doing this man.  He's making this happen.

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Rawrhock,16,Sun Jun 7 20:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  This part has pretty much cemented that Lonesome Road will be a death sentence.  Then again, LR is the DLC I've played the least, so maybe Jon has some tricks that will help him pull ahead.    Hm...thinking about it...you can snipe most things in LR, and can't you just blow stealth boys to get past the tunnelers?  Jon might want to pick up the Chemist perk for that."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,17,Sun Jun 7 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"There's the one bit in Lonesome Road where you ride the elevator platform down and tunnelers attack. No way PD Shoot survives that encounter, even with 139HP left."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,15,Sun Jun 7 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"Either riot shotgun and And Stay Back, or upgraded LMG + Hollow Point ammo, combined with stealth boys and GRX... It MIGHT be doable."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,DBrody6,3,Mon Jun 8 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"Have you considered using the Flare Gun? I've admittedly never used it but it's supposed to ""terrify"" Deathclaws and Tunnelers...the two major concerns in LR. If the effect is actually useful then it could be the edge you need to survive that bullshit elevator ride. Though you'll definitely hit minor radiation sickness :/"
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,EzekielTombs,3,Mon Jun 8 07:56:06 2015 UTC,"True, good point, Flare Gun all the time. You're right on rad sickness - even with rad-x all the time, I've got to hit minor sickness."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,thirdtotheleft,3,Mon Jun 8 08:15:36 2015 UTC,Having recently played through LR I can't say I encountered rads above one per second and mostly in avoidable places. If you give the warheads a minute or so the rads dissipate and no harm done. I think the only place where there are unavoidable rads is in the military base at the start  and the elevator ride but it's still just 1 R/ps.

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,2,Tue Jun 9 09:30:21 2015 UTC,"Dunno, never thought about using a stealth boy there. Who knows, if Jon does even make it out of Dead Money he'll have access to his heavy armor and much better weapons again. We might see this through to the end."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Squoghunter1492,13,Sun Jun 7 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I said it in previous comments, but I think that the ascent and descent from the tower is the hardest part in the whole DLC, and that spear should prove that point.  Jon got lucky with his Stealthboy draw, but it's still damn good that he's actually INSIDE the casino.  I can quickly screenshot the location of every holo emitter inside the place if need be to shut down any threat the holograms pose, as well as screenshotting locations of radios that need to be taken out.  Jon, if you are reading this:  Do not be afraid to use GRX to do some of the radios.  ESPECIALLY in the Vault.  There is an area I've died at many times because you have to make a mad dash to a computer terminal to shut off a shielded radio, but there's a hidden, unshielded radio right behind you when you reach the terminal which I've forgotten about dozens of times."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Rawrhock,14,Sun Jun 7 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"If you've got shots of the bloody projectors in that final bloody room, that would be a godsend for planning the angles to take them out."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,czokletmuss,45,Sun Jun 7 22:42:59 2015 UTC,"Alright.  I went ahead and cleared out the room before hand for easier screenshotting.  http://i.imgur.com/8ipktG4.jpg  The entrance here.  To the left you can see where the first emitter is.  http://i.imgur.com/IhHniK2.jpg  If you toss a grenade up there, it should take it out.  When the emitter is killed, the other holograms will turn hostile, so chuck and run.  http://i.imgur.com/L8X5Moc.jpg  To the right of the entrance you see this over here.  http://i.imgur.com/RhsasRG.jpg  This beam will allow you to hop up.  http://i.imgur.com/Zo4Ntcs.jpg  From up there, you can follow these stairs up to the rafters or whatever they're called.  http://i.imgur.com/TKKAOaN.jpg  The red circle is an emitter.  To the left leads to the first emitter.  http://i.imgur.com/QkYAJi6.jpg  This is the circled emitter from the last screenshot.  If you toss a grenade around this area, it will kill it.  http://i.imgur.com/xdXEVr7.jpg  From the vantage point of the previous screenshot, you can see this little room.  It houses the last emitter.  http://i.imgur.com/5Gu1v5u.jpg  The last emitter is tucked away in the corner, hidden on the ceiling.  It took me ages to find this one.  You can kill it with a grenade from the entrance, but it's trickier.  http://i.imgur.com/P7LL2l6.jpg  The left arrow from a few screenshots ago.  http://i.imgur.com/aOcb9HX.jpg  And here is the first emitter up close, and you can see the entrance there.    My strategy now is:  Come into room, grenade the first emitter to the left, run like Heck.  Once hidden again, grenade the middle emitter (right above the forcefield), run like Heck.  The final emitter/hologram can then be grenaded from a distance, or snuck around until you can reach the computer and cut off the speaker.  If you have 100 repair, you can switch them off."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,WiggleTheStick,6,Tue Jun 9 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm pretty much assuming Jon will blow half his load of SB's on the tunnelers and the other half on the deathclaws."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NuclearChickadee,10,Sun Jun 7 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"The deathclaws aren't SO bad - the irradiated ones have zero DT, so Paciencia + hollow point becomes extremely powerful again."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,WiggleTheStick,4,Sun Jun 7 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"My knowledge of LR is limited, but I believe you can snipe or avoid altogether all the deathclaws in LR."

They are pretty much only found in tight spaces, so sniping becomes much harder. Ironically the Tunneler queen and her little gang are probably the easiest for a sniper to deal with."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,ROPROPE,6,Sun Jun 7 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"True, but again, zero DT - they're glass cannons, and go down fairly quickly to the right weaponry.  If they hit me though..."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,IJerkToEverything,21,Sun Jun 7 21:10:10 2015 UTC,Are you mad?! I want to stay as far away from level 45 as possible - the deathclaws will become unstoppable after that.

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,mattinthecrown,5,Mon Jun 8 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"Let's look at this another way:  From quests alone, he'll earn 17,720 xp, for each Tunneler he kills (aside from the Queen) he'll earn 200 xp, 10 xp for each Marked Man and 50 xp for every LR Deathclaw. Let's round that overall xp to 22,000-23,000 because he will be killing a lot of things. That's enough to throw Jon over to level 39.  He can safely grind some levels, but the HP boost he can get from the grinding is easily overshadowed by a single dose of Buffout.  That said; Jon, don't forget about Buffout!"
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Martient712,3,Mon Jun 8 07:18:56 2015 UTC,"HP boost he can get from the grinding is easily overshadowed by a single dose of Buffout.   The temporary boost in HP from buffout is useless under this ruleset, since the damage would still come out of the true health counter."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Scizo1,3,Mon Jun 8 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know that he did explicitly in regards to buffout, but I'm pretty sure Jon talked at one point about losing HP when/if he gets the endurance penalty from radiation poisoning.   Also, allowing buffout to absorb damage would give him free damage every time he used buffout, which isn't consistent with the way he's been playing."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,18,Mon Jun 8 17:06:01 2015 UTC,"The game decided to throw a bone at you with that stealth boy! Good job Jon! I cannot believe that you went through all that and made it out alive. My question is, does it only get harder from here?"
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Scizo1,15,Sun Jun 7 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"The casino itself has some unavoidable damage, I think, and some tough fights too. If I survive them, it's the approach to the Vault that could be deadly."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,grapesie,10,Sun Jun 7 20:20:28 2015 UTC,The part with Dog/God and turning off the gas has unavoidable damage. The gas does a small amount of damage when you're in there.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,timo103,15,Sun Jun 7 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know - though I've never been sure why. No other gas leak in the game causes damage..."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,acksed,11,Sun Jun 7 21:00:46 2015 UTC,"Well I'll be.  I didn't realize the gas did damage.  I just checked it out on one of my saves and it does, in fact, deal damage.  Luckily, not much, and you can stop the damage by sealing the valves.  So what I did was as soon as I got in, I ran forward, shut off the first valve.  I was hoping that'd stop the damage in that area, but it didn't.  I then quickly ran to Dog (no GRX), speech checked him, then ran to the rest of the valves.  I took 5 damage total, but with GRX running you might be able to do it without taking any damage, or just 1-2.  So, a miniscule problem.  Fighting the ghost people will prove much more dangerous."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,mattinthecrown,5,Sun Jun 7 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"Huh, I thought you had to do the valves before speaking to Dog or it was explosion and death?"
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Secret_Wizard,12,Sun Jun 7 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"No.  The way (I think) it works is that if Dog sees you coming, he'll blow everything up.  You can simply sneak up to him (fairly easy with 100 sneak and silent running) then talk to him and speech check him, then you have free reign to shut off the valves.    Alternatively, pop a dose of GRX, sneak halfway to him, then get up and run to him.  You have some time after he notices you to still talk to him.  At least, in the PC version...you may just want to GRX sneak all the way up to him to be safe."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,thirdtotheleft,5,Sun Jun 7 22:09:55 2015 UTC,"Jon, do multiple runs with this save."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,2,Mon Jun 8 05:53:24 2015 UTC,I've always just ran up and talked to him.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,thirdtotheleft,2,Mon Jun 8 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"Not with high speech. You can just run up and say hi. Mess up, and you go boom, but otherwise he won't blow you up."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,GTS250,4,Sun Jun 7 22:30:15 2015 UTC,I imagine copious amounts of mines would do well for Elijah.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,darnclem,4,Sun Jun 7 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"In Jon's case, the best way to handle Elijah is doubtlessly to trap him in the vault.  You don't have to wait or anything, as soon as Elijah says he's coming down, you sneak out the door and head back the way you came in, and once you're out of the general vault area, you can stand up and just book it back to the elevator.  I managed to get all the way back to the elevator before Elijah even realized I was trapping him."

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,theflyingcheese,13,Sun Jun 7 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Came here to post this. Jon's probably not in the habit of using the GRX implant (since you have to access inventory). GRX is amazing against those fast, shifty Ghost people. Not only do you buy yourself time, but you miss a lot less when they are in slow mo!   And best of all, now that he has the perk - it's essentially free.   I would highly recommend that John take the Chemist perk next, which doubles the GRX duration to 4 seconds (the 2nd level of GRX improves time to 3s, and adds an additional 5 uses).   With both Chemist and GRX Perk 2, John will have 6 seconds of time slow each use, and 10 uses a day. That's essentially 10+ free kills. This is one of those combo perks that allows you to crowbar Legendary Deathclaws to death."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,dabisnit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:34:50 2015 UTC,"I too came to say just this. Jon is regenerating GRX much much faster than he goes through it, and fighting while it's active just makes combat so trivial. In slomo, you should be hitting every shot and getting the full 300 DPS out of the BAR."

EDIT: ""No reason to not do looting if there's loot available"" - my main man MATN :D  EDIT2: I guess one of the ghost people must've activated the first mine trap and thus the third one due to splash damage. Hence why you got -10HP because of your own trap.  EDIT3: SHE LIVES! P.D. Shoot alive in Casino! I doubt you will make it through Lonesome Road with 139HP though. Goddamit Jon, don't die!"

Kinda doubting your chances of making it through Lonesome road now though. :(  Double EDIT: Just in case P.D Shoot doesn't live much longer you should consider padding the video out somehow if it'd be particularly short to help stop us guessing that you've died. I want to be shocked if you unfortunately don't manage to make it all the way.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Perry87,11,Sun Jun 7 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've always thought he'd show, especially if he died in Lonesome Road, the long walk all the way back to the rollercoaster in Primm, where he said he'll throw himself from if he ever reaches 0 health.

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Domperidone,3,Sun Jun 7 21:07:15 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you use the GRX with the Stealth Boy simultaneously? Wouldn't that have made the Stealth Boy last much longer?
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"It'd make it last a little longer, but as was seen, it wasn't necessary."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Domperidone,3,Sun Jun 7 21:09:06 2015 UTC,Jon is much more well adjusted than I am. I would have broke down in tears at that spear hit.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Martient712,3,Sun Jun 7 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"For my first several runs of Dead Money i always picked up the Embalming Fluid assuming it did something or would be useful later. It's not, just dead weight. It's just the DLC being a troll again."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Domperidone,3,Sun Jun 7 22:18:35 2015 UTC,The sneaking with a stealth boy horrified me when you turned the corner and saw two Ghost People
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,3,Mon Jun 8 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"That sneaking through the ghost people using a stealth boy was easily the most nerve-wracking part of this entire run. I can only imagine how terrifying that was for P.D. Shoot herself. Oh, and this episode is further proof that Jon put all of his SPECIAL points into luck when he was born."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Domperidone,6,Mon Jun 8 06:56:05 2015 UTC,So now I'm curious how you kinda plan these runs out.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,tacitus59,7,Sun Jun 7 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Think it's 'do lots of test runs, be extra cautious, then rush through anyway'."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Huzzahtime,7,Mon Jun 8 01:41:12 2015 UTC,45 minute episode. That's a good sign

ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Kittenclysm,2,Sun Jun 7 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"I feel that the ghost people in the lobby might be the end of P. D. Shoot. Even my op melee/unarmed character took damage in the casino lobby. I've tried mining the hell out of that area, but mines just kill one ghost person at most and alarm the others, curious to see what MATN is gonna do about them."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Fadman_Loki,6,Sun Jun 7 21:59:55 2015 UTC,... Maybe we need MORE mines...
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Kittenclysm,3,Sun Jun 7 22:15:16 2015 UTC,You could get 130-140 mines (after you break the bank) and maybe a demolition expert perk after levelling up. I wish you all the luck in the world.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,lolnochill,6,Sun Jun 7 22:50:47 2015 UTC,"What we -really- need are the exact spawn locations of the ghost people.  If we had that, simply placing a handful of mines at each spawn location would be the most effective strategy.  That's beyond my ability though."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Kittenclysm,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:01:33 2015 UTC,I could replay the casino bit a few times and find out if there really are predetermined spawn locations. But it will take some time...
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,SephirothClone,2,Mon Jun 8 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"If it were that simple I'd just do it myself.  The problem is that the ghost people will start moving as soon as they spawn, making pinning down their exact spawn locations difficult enough, even more so that they'll immediately try to fight you as well.  I suppose if you're really determined, you could save and reload with a stealth boy to get approximate locations, but I fear I lack that kind of determination.  I suppose it'd be easier if you get lucky and pull multiple stealth boys (my save that I loaded screenshots from has two stealth boys somehow)."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,Tricolorbob,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah stealthboy, tunnel runner, speed implant, high agility and implant grx should do the trick.

Anyways, here are my screenshots after doing the Dog/God quest in Cantina Madrid. There are 3 Ghost people, one in front of the Casino door, the other in front of the Suites and the third by the theater door. http://postimg.org/image/k87gq6plh/  http://postimg.org/image/e6u8ntdkn/  http://postimg.org/image/7dycc7mil/  after Dean Dominos Quest there are 4 ghost people in the lobby. the first one wanders on the porch in front of the theater entrance  http://postimg.org/image/6vlv90111/  the second is (just like before) in front of the suites  http://postimg.org/image/7ssdszjjj/  the third one is having a dejavu in front of the casino door  http://postimg.org/image/fbbj1mawf/  and the last one is sitting near the main entrance (but wanders down the stairs later)  http://postimg.org/image/rr5rpyht5/  I'll do the other quest tomorrow."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,RealFoxD,2,Mon Jun 8 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"Very nicely done.  On my next day off, I'll take your screenshots and test out some mining to see how effective it is."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,NoOneImportant4,3,Tue Jun 9 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"This would be really awesome, it's definitely very time consuming to do this kind of ""research"" alone.  My main problem atm is the ghost people in front of the suites, if you could find out where they spawn, that would be really, really good. Apparantely the one that spawns after the Dog quest (Dog-Ghost-Person) is  2-3 meters to the right of the suites door (if you're facing the door) and the Dean-Ghost-Person is slightly to the left..? I am absolutely not sure about that.  But the good news is, they both follow the path to the right of the suites doors eventually. They will go into caution after their friends get blown up, but if you stay hidden (especially easy after the Dean Domino Quest, just wait a bit after entering the lobby) they'll go back to the predetermined path to the right of the suites entrance, so placing mines along that path is probably the smartest thing to do, for the lack of better alternatives.  That was the mine placement that worked well for me (except the suites one), hope it helps you:  after dog/god   in front of the casino door http://imgur.com/mVXCdQg the suites mystery(I've marked the path they walk with the green arrow) http://imgur.com/Dur7mUt theater http://imgur.com/7563qH6   after dean domino   in front of the casino door http://imgur.com/mVXCdQg the suites mystery http://imgur.com/Dur7mUt theater (a different location from the dog/god one) http://imgur.com/ZiZWgLH main entrance http://imgur.com/9lRFaA9   aaand the last one: the first thing you see after doing Christine's part and entering the lobby:  http://imgur.com/hZ1ODBG  One ghost person in front of the suites and another near the theater area. I've taken the screenshot right after entering the lobby so mining the exact locations of the ghost people would be your best bet. (btw, crazy leveling with photoshop, because I feel like the screenshots look way too dark on mobile phones)  And that's what the lower level looks like.   http://imgur.com/2K67QW2 http://imgur.com/yekayKn  One in front of the casino/restaurant another near the staircase,   but he WILL go up the stairs eventually (or at least halfway up the stairs), so putting some mines there seems like a good idea (?).  http://imgur.com/DjmrI6U  For every ghost person you kill in the lobby one ghost person gets spawned right in front of the main entrance (in the end there will be 3 of them: a seeker, a harvester and a trapper). They are spawned one by one and they will go up the stairs if in caution.  http://imgur.com/uFVzF1b  4 ghost people in the beginning + 3 in the end. (14 ghost people if you count all lobby fights. It's possible to blow up 12 of them with mines, 7-8 mines/ghost person ~90-100 mines)  side note: satchel charges are amazing and silent running is the best perk one could get imho. Oh, and the gas in cantina madrid will deal 5-7 HP damage even if you know what you are doing."
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,The_Munz,2,Tue Jun 9 10:30:36 2015 UTC,Congrats - that was very impressive.
ManyATrueNerd,38xqo7,mojave_merc,2,Sun Jun 7 22:04:30 2015 UTC,That Stealth Boy pretty much saved the run. No way you could have done that last part with 139 hit points. You are one lucky man.

ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,ManyATrueNerd,6,Mon Jun 8 07:12:09 2015 UTC,"Fallout Switzerland: 90% of the population survive in tunnels, bunkers and mountain huts. The destroyed industrial base leads to famine and a civil war. Bands of bankers rove the land in search of investments. Gold bricks used as decoration. K31 and STGW57 rifles everywhere. Combat trams patrol in the remains of Zurich. And in the shadow looms... the Ricola man."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,hopsafoobar,4,Mon Jun 8 12:35:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a really interesting setting. The problem is if Sawyer isn't in charge, Bethesda might just make a COD clone with vehicle sections."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,lskyw,2,Mon Jun 8 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"I'm withholding complete judgment until after I've played Fallout 4, but my thought is that Bethesda should just farm out its Fallout franchise to Obsidian and focus on doing Elder Scrolls games.  TES is Todd Howard's baby and it shows.  Fallout belongs to the Black Isle Remnants (dear old friends, remember Interplay) and it shows in how they approach the 'verse they've created."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,RealFoxD,7,Tue Jun 9 23:57:45 2015 UTC,"I want Fallout in Europe too because let's be honest, European cities are much more intersting than ones in our former colonies (muh legacy). I would LOVE to take a walk through radioactive ruins of Barcelona, Paris or Berlin."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,czokletmuss,3,Mon Jun 8 07:20:55 2015 UTC,"Well, they wouldn't be radioactive yet. The game would be set somewhere around 2050, during the resource war between the EU and the Saudis."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,czokletmuss,3,Mon Jun 8 07:26:09 2015 UTC,"I wasn't refering to Resources Wars, I just generally would like to see Fallout set on other continent. Hell, even DLC when action takes places in Canada would be nice. So far - apart from Mothership Zeta - every DLC and every game was set in USA and it's a damn shame. I mean imagine Fallout: Hong Kong, wouldn't it be awesome?"
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,Squoghunter1492,3,Mon Jun 8 07:30:51 2015 UTC,"Eh. Still discards the whole retro-future and 1950's America style of Fallout. Fallout without America really doesn't make sense. I know that that's become an unpopular opinion at this point, but it's true. 1950's American culture doesn't apply to England, or China, or anywhere else, so... What makes it Fallout?   There's also the fact that none of the technology, factions, characters, or anything else in Fallout would be present. So you're basically left with... What? An RPG with decaying weapons and armor that you have to repair, and surviving in a strange land? Alright, you've got a game there, but what makes it Fallout? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I will say Canada, or even Mexico would be interesting, since they're right next door and Canada was even annexed by the US before the war. And if what Raul says is true, then Mexico was very heavily influenced by American interests (IE Petro-Chica). But outside of North America, it just stops being Fallout.  /rant"
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,Sub-Mongoloid,3,Tue Jun 9 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"I think there's enough cultural crossover that an English setting would be accessible to U.S. audiences, taking cues from the late 50's early 60's era of cultural development you could see the traditional British stiff upper lip of the post war era, the rise of mods and beatle-mania, allusions to pick floyd's the wall, 1984 and Animal farm, and movies like James Bond, The Wicker Man, Straw Dogs, or An American Werewolf in London.  Since the basic idea of the alternate universe is a folksy ultra-nationalism it's an easy switch over from the reverence for the founding fathers seen in FO:3 for patriotism towards the good old monarchy, and when it comes to factions there's nothing to say that the Brotherhood of Steel and Vault-tec wouldn't have European branches.  In fact, only the BoS and Supermutants really tie the various games together and if factions were to have the look and feel of those groups (Knights of the Rom table?  Frankensteins?) I think people would accept them in a world that looked and acted like current Fallout games.  All that being said, I think the further you went into Europe, Russia, China, etc. the harder it would be to relate to the universe, Fallout: Finland would have a great many jokes flying over the player's head so it would be important to keep a game rooted with a 'cultural cousin' as it were."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,RealFoxD,2,Tue Jun 9 13:52:32 2015 UTC,"Fallout Russia would only work if it played not into Russians' view of themselves, but how Americans viewed Russians during the Cold War (""In Soviet Russia..."" and thick accents and borscht.)  Which also means you could never, ever see Fallout China because it'd be racist as hell by definition."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,ignotussomnium,2,Tue Jun 9 23:59:59 2015 UTC,"We've got hints of how China was through the games. Point Lookout had that one Chinese spy quest and there's the Mama Dolche spy HQ.

ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,RealFoxD,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"That's asking a lot of even good game writers not to have it devolve into stereotypes that would set the Internet on full-on Great War status.

ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,Sub-Mongoloid,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the reason the Chinese are the Enemy in Fallout is that one of the Fallout Devs was on the phone with a friend in Russia, and they were interrupted by a bunch of loud noise. The dev asked what that was, and the friend commented that is was just the russian mafia firing off guns outside.  It was at that point that they realized how far russia had gone down the tubes."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,RealFoxD,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:24:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe if there was a small, self contained DLC it could probably be done from the Russian perspective as we know a lot more about life during the cold war for them than we used to.  It could actually be a fascinating mirror to our own perspectives to see Russians glorifying communism and demonizing filthy capitalists, I think it would need a high concept setting though -my idea, 'Space-Racists' set on secret Soviet and U.S. moon bases (Did we go to the moon in Fallout AU?) as the last remnants of the superpowers battle it out for supremacy on the only place not devastated by nuclear fire- because otherwise you could just play 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R.' and 'This War of Mine' to get the exact feel of Fallout: Moscow Madness.  EDIT:  Yes, it appears that we went to the moon repeatedly between 1969 and 2052, no word on whether or not the Ruskies did as well but as a tantalizing note the Lunar Lander displayed in the Museum of Technology is a Soviet design."
ManyATrueNerd,38zqof,salasy,3,Wed Jun 10 12:42:09 2015 UTC,During the Resource Wars is when the first nukes started to fly---Tel Aviv got the first one in December (happy Chanukah!) of 2052.

ManyATrueNerd,38ycep,RealFoxD,2,Mon Jun 8 01:02:05 2015 UTC,They're way better at hand crafting now. I think FNV fell a bit short really. But F3 and Skyrim have it set.
ManyATrueNerd,38ycep,Martient712,4,Mon Jun 8 17:19:59 2015 UTC,Honestly. I'd totally buy this game. Sounds like it would be fun to play.
ManyATrueNerd,38ycep,JB434,3,Sun Jun 7 22:04:31 2015 UTC,Amen to that.  Although being a good Yank I'd have to side with the anti-royalists on principle.
ManyATrueNerd,38ycep,RealFoxD,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:02:54 2015 UTC,Wasn't Europe ridiculously poor and weak because they ran out of oil and couldn't compete with America and China in the FO universe? I doubt they would have the fancy robots you commonly see in the American wastes
ManyATrueNerd,38ycep,GNRoberts12,3,Mon Jun 8 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"While Europe was rather devastated by the resource wars there's nothing to say things haven't changed dramatically in the 200+ years since the bombs dropped.  Robots were used in a military capacity prior to the war and I think it would be reasonable that the government and military of Britain had a resource of automatons at their disposal, during the great war the remaining elites of society most likely had bunker systems similar to vault-tec's and when they would re-emerge their access to advanced technologies would have allowed them to remain masters of society, especially with a beaten down general populace.  Or perhaps England was spared the brunt of the bombings due to being in a weak position prior to the war or there may have been a last ditch missile defense system akin to what Mr. House had in New Vegas.  Since all of the world's oil had run out there would be little incentive to rebuild old tech when the world could now be powered on Microfusion cells and EC packs, perhaps the British equivalent of the Brotherhood of Steel (Knights of Cyber?) would be more interested in sharing tech and promoting innovation rather than hoarding it.  The fact is that there's very little concrete lore about the state of Europe and it would be much more interesting to see a culture which progressed on a different path from the Americas rather than one that's simply destitute and barren."
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,Vladnim,15,Sun Jun 7 22:37:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say 3 is a fine starting point - it's fairly simple in its mechanics, broadly linear if you want it to be, and not too long.  New Vegas is a bit more complex mechanically and non-linear, so perhaps worth doing after.  There's no need to back to the old ones, but if you like that style of game, go for it."
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,ManyATrueNerd,3,Sun Jun 7 22:44:31 2015 UTC,What are the older ones even like? It looks kind of Diablo-esque
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,forgodandthequeen,8,Sun Jun 7 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"They are A) Much weirder. While later games attempt to be a bit more grounded, Fallout 1 and especially 2 is a madcap romp through some crazy crazy shit. B) More adult in themes. You can kill kids and become a prostitute, two things that only mods can do in later games. C) Occasionally punishingly hard. Not because of any clever design quite a lot of the time, but simply because the UI is unintuitive and every single shot is a dice roll. The final boss of 2 is one of the hardest final boss's I've ever had the misfortune to face."
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,JB434,5,Sun Jun 7 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"I've not played them but they're purely isometric turn based RPG's. Not FPS:RPGs like Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Very interesting lore wise but otherwise, personally I'm perfectly happy not having played them.  It doesn't matter which order you play Fallout 3 and New Vegas in because they're on completely different sides of the continent and literally do not affect each other. In my opinion, Fallout 3 has a more interesting world to wander around while New Vegas has superior gameplay, weapon selection and other mechanics.  I'd say just get stuck into Fallout 3 personally and ignore any videos, wikis or guides unless you get really stuck. It'll be more interesting that way."
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,Ilitarist,2,Sun Jun 7 23:07:43 2015 UTC,"They're not like Diablo. Fewer battles, but battles are turn-based and therefore longer. There's overworld map so you travel between towns and dungeons. Most of your game you'll be in some sort of town. It's very unintuitive. There's First Aid skill and Doctor skill. It's never clear when should you use skills like Repair or Science - there's no weapon maintenance and no hacking.   UI hasn't aged well. Those are nice games but don't expect great writing or story. Even atmosphere was great in 1997 but not now.  I'm glad I've played them 15 years ago but you should skip it unless you're ready to suffer through UI and turn-based combat."

ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,RealFoxD,8,Mon Jun 8 06:03:10 2015 UTC,"Playing the games chronologically means wading through 1997-98 PC RPG mechanics, and that's very, very daunting to new players (imagine playing the Final Fantasy series and starting at FF1 on the NES if you've only ever played modern JRPGs.)  I find Fallout 3 hard to recommend as a starting point, because New Vegas does everything 3 did, but better.  Better storytelling, tighter combat mechanics, weapon mods, item crafting, and the non-linear story is never daunting---the game very clearly marks every place the player would want to start once getting through the very linear extended tutorial that is going after Benny in the first place.  New Vegas is, to my mind, the greatest game of all time, and the only risk I'd see with starting a new player at that point in the series is that it would spoil the rest of the games for them on account of they're not as good.  (that said, I liked Fallout: Tactics out of all proportion to that game's actual quality, but it's a master's degree course in old-school CRPG combat, so a new player should definitely NOT start there unless they've been playing those sorts of games since the SSI Gold Box WW2 games.)"
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,acksed,5,Mon Jun 8 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"If you're curious about the first and second games, read this Fallout 1 playthrough and this Fallout 2 playthrough.  NV and 3 have different, unconnected stories. Fallout 3 is the best introduction to the themes, among them 1950s American optimism run rampant, weird science, raygun technology and war. Walk the wasteland, find out about this strange new world you've stepped out in, try to survive and eventually fit in.  Fallout: New Vegas is a more refined game. You're already a part of this world, but all that you were was stolen away from you by a bullet to the head. Given a second chance, what will you do?"
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,jeharris25,2,Mon Jun 8 00:49:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need to know the story to get yourself into the new games.  Both Fallout 3, and New Vegas give you all the background that you need.  There will just be one or two references that you might not understand (Harold and Bob)  Fallout 1 and 2, and Tactics are a completely different look and feel.  Instead of being shooters, the skill points, and dice rolls determine how the weapons hit, and whether you succeed in lockpicks and terminals.  This makes the games much harder, and even frustrating in a few places (don't stand in front of Ian when he has the SMG)  They're definitely worth a play through if a quality story is important to you, but don't feel as if you need to start there.  The storytelling/plot in 1, 2, and New Vegas is far superior to 3."
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,Fadman_Loki,2,Mon Jun 8 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say start at 3, then do New Vegas, as Vegas has considerably better mechanics. If you go from new vegas to 3, you can easily notice the missing features, and you probably won't enjoy it as much."
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,Grandpa_Edd,2,Mon Jun 8 02:55:57 2015 UTC,that makes sense. I definitely would not enjoy Mass Effect as much if I started with the second one
ManyATrueNerd,38yhdu,Lazzer555,2,Wed Jun 10 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"Start with 3 and New Vegas. If you dislike silly and over the top start with 3 because it feels bleak and desperate, not that New Vegas is silly (ignoring Old World Blues DLC) but it's more lighthearted than 3.  Then if you are really interested play 1 and 2.  Note that 1 and 2 are completely different games (mechanically) and are really unforgiving."

Still a bit pricey, it was cheaper on the last sale but still not too much.  And if you do not like it after an hour and a half you can return it and get your money back.  So, i would say, start there :)"

The lore is really interesting but you can find all that on the Fallout Wiki annd there's a timeline of events too! I spent 7 hours just reading and reading, only got halfway though.

ManyATrueNerd,38vu31,templar_,8,Sun Jun 7 07:59:04 2015 UTC,"For the most part, yes,though due to varying circumstances.   Yes, because under certain circumstances, a family could repeatedly have children at relatively young ages over several generations, thus shortening the average length in years of a typical generation (which averages around 20 years)  Taking the average length of a generation into account, 20x13 yields 260, which if you subtract that from 2015, you get 1755, roughly a generation before America came into being as an independent nation.  However, in the case of my family, people tended to have children later in life over the course of multiple generations, so the span between the average generation in my family is roughly double what it typically is. That is to say, based on average of the ages of people my age's parents, my parents are old enough to be their parents, if that makes sense.  However, given the general slow rate at which a new generation arises in my family, one would surmise we would, subtracting all those years, have been here well before the founding of America as an independent nation.  And that is true. the first known ancestor in my family in the New World came over with the last few members of the Leiden Congregation from Holland in 1629.  So, we've been here a fair while, is what I'm trying to say."
ManyATrueNerd,38vu31,PantsBonanza,4,Sun Jun 7 08:55:12 2015 UTC,"Also, I realize this was waaaaay more in-depth than it needed to be. But I couldn't help it."
ManyATrueNerd,38vu31,PantsBonanza,5,Sun Jun 7 09:02:00 2015 UTC,"Impressive.  My family can only trace its American-ness back to the 1930s.  Before that, my mom's side of the family was variously in France or Ireland, and my dad's side...well, if they hadn't come across the border, I'd be among the oldest Canadian clans, since my dad's descended from a mix of French fur trappers and Micmac tribals going back quite possibly as far as the early voyages of Jacques Cartier (and, on the tribal side, further back than that.)"
ManyATrueNerd,38vu31,RealFoxD,3,Sun Jun 7 09:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's about how it is with my dad's family too. We can reliably trace it back about 200 years in the US, and then a bit after that in Switzerland, but after that it gets more and more wibbly, and becomes more based on anecdotal evidence of previous generations.  Isn't genealogy just neat?"
ManyATrueNerd,38vu31,PantsBonanza,2,Sun Jun 7 10:20:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, no doubt.

The english were much more concerned about maintaining control of its sugar colonies in the west indies to commit full troop numbers.  In the end the English signed the treaty of paris, putting and end to its 4 way war surrendering the us colonies but shoring up strong financial ties and securing passage of its 80,000 strong loyalists and freed salves to move to canada and stop being covered in pitch ransacked or assassinated."

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,SovietDomino,18,Sun Jun 7 11:54:59 2015 UTC,"I agree immensly on the topic of the living world. The fact that very little response is given to your actions annoy me to no end. For example, if you walk in to The Fort and murder Caesar, his advisors and everyone in there, the Legion is still as strong as ever even though that is supposed to be their main base in the Mojave. The faction bases should be massive defended areas, that could be impossible to take on alone. But, you could gather a team of companions, train them (as stated in the video) and create your own little strike team. Take out defenses one by one, (say a sniper taking out heavy weapons, an explosive expert breaching the gate or a stealth character taking out internal defenses) and cooridnate the attack. And have that attack matter. People talk about the daring raid you pulled off, and how that weakened said faction.   And to add to this. One thing i always wanted to do in Vegas was pull off some Oceans 11 gig. Rob the casinos, become wanted by the Strip and the NCR. And when i saw the Airship in the trailer, imagine taking it, ans securing it for the faction you support.   Your video made me realize how much i want Fallout 4 to be alive. Make it a breathing world that you only live in, dont make the world center around you, and have everything be about you. I would love for factions to act independant of you, even taking it as far as if you dont contribute at all, conflicts resolve themselves.  Thats something that annoyed me with Skyrim. There is a civil war, but there never feels like it. Or the NCR/Legion Conflict. Nobody does anything, except one or two soldiers attacking a caravan. The Legion should assault Helios One, and the NCR should try to take it back. If they dont, maybe the Legion uses the Archimedes weapon in the final battle, or to take out the Sharecropper farm, leaving the NCR with less food.   There is SO much that could be done! Rant over...."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Whentheboats,10,Sat Jun 6 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"The thing about Fallout is that it is really not about combat... it's a first person RPG with puzzle, shooter, and comedy themes."

People would talk about the guy who killed an important character or won an important battle."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Sub-Mongoloid,6,Sat Jun 6 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"On the flip side to violent impacts, it always seemed like such a let down when you defended some place from attackers (Bigtown, Goodsprings) and then things just went back to normal as it had been before the attack.  If you stop a town from getting wiped off the map or resolve some longstanding impasse then shouldn't that town prosper?  Bring in more merchants, more settlers, more influence?  I think it would be immensely satisfying to walk into a po-dunk settlement, so a couple of missions, and come back later to see it thriving due to your actions."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Dblitzer,8,Sun Jun 7 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"For example, if you walk in to The Fort and murder Caesar, his advisors and everyone in there, the Legion is still as strong as ever even though that is supposed to be their main base in the Mojave.   Yep, it's one of the reasons why I never do it. Killing Caesar essentially means that the in game plot stops make a lot of sense. It's a bit baffling that New Vegas even allows you to personally meet with a character, of which an entire factions basic survival essentially hinges on.  But yeah, having open worlds where things flow and feel flexible has always been one of my great desires, ever since eleven year old me picked up GTA 3......... Only to find out that all those gangs listed in the manual never really fought each other in game or could take turf from each other. It's not enough to just have plot based world changes, give me the sense of an evolving world, even if it's fairly basic."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,RealFoxD,4,Sun Jun 7 12:04:40 2015 UTC,"There is one really cool ""murder Caesar"" bit in New Vegas that I stumbled upon entirely by accident and posted about in a thread on this very subreddit:  Normally, if you get to ""Liked"" or better with the Legion before going along the main questline past ""Beware the Wrath of Caesar!"", your Legion infamy goes to max but hit squads don't spawn because you're either ""Soft-Hearted Devil"" or ""Wild Child"", i.e. neutral.

You start out in the Vault(or wherever) and before leaving they upgrade your kit, ""This all the pre-war data we could find, you should be able to use terminals around the wastes to update this information as you explore."" This would need to be fleshed out a bit but it could go something like:  You need Science of 25 to upgrade a sector from prewar map data to a more correct version.   If you have 25 Survival you can upgrade a sector with greater detail.   You could then scale the abilities so having high enough stats tags points of interest, or potential danger and etc... Of course, this could end up a tedious waste of time. BUT, it would definitely increase immersion."

Especially with your particular example: the NCR of course knows not only the exact location of it's ranger stations, but also how to get to them! Not that they tell you.. Still, a different example could have been better.

It's entirely possible many people are using old PipBoy and those are chips. Protagonist doesn't care about salvaging PipBoy 3000, he might as well ignore PipBoy 2000."

While in NV there was no background story, in FO3 we know that the character was raised by an extremly caring person, who's beloved wife died while giving birth and best friend is a good technician. Being a bad gunner would be logical, as you were raised in a vault, but I doubt that your father would leave the vault and you, which he must have planned for quite some time, without teaching you basic medicine skills and use of every day equipment. I don't want to be insensitive, but you, the character, would need to be retarded, to be unable to use basic equipment under those circumstances. Being bad at something is okay, but it has to match the background.    2) Companions are too strong. I totally agree, Broken Steel made companions overpowered in FO3 and in NV they always bugged me. In addition to their strength, some of the perks were just weird. In my opinion they should remove companions or make them ""smart"", but balanced. If your companions charge everything and draw aggro, they need to be beefy or it's a bad experience for casual gamers. Imagine you're new to Fallout and your squishy companion just yolo charges a band of raiders under attack of a super mutant, to die instantly. So they got high damage attacks, unlimited ammo and lots of health, but that makes them too strong in combination with any player who's used to Fallout.  3) Kill everything! That would be nice, but I don't see it happen, as it, again, is bad for casual/new players. Maybe they allow it, but it would require backup quests and storylines or a very streamlined story. You need to identify important persons on first sight. An example: Imagine the neutral vendor in Evergreen Mills would be part of the main questline, and was formerly a brilliant scientist. He is in the raider cave, so you oneshot him and you wouldn't even KNOW he was important, later your quest is broken or only the bad ways are left, because you shot a raider. Mr. Genericrobot Questgiver is a solution, but i think it's a bad one and if they reuse it, I'm disappointed. Maybe they offer a kill everyone option in hardcore mode, that would be nice. Easiest solution would be to mod FO4. (I always recommend the PC version of Bethesda games, as the dev console helps to bypass, possibly gamebreaking, glitches and allows easier testing and mods.)  4) Co-op I'd love to see co-op modes, but nothing more than three players. In my opinion they would also work in setting similar to Fallout 3, but only as a seperate save file.    Possible way for a co-op start based on FO3: Player creation for all three players. Then Player 1 starts to play the vault part up until they leave the vault. When you make your escape Player 2 spawns in, as ""Amata"", she has an own path and needs to talk her way out of the overseer's office or use force. Player 3 spawns as ""Butch"" and needs to rescue his mother, when he's spotted by vault security to collaborate with Player 1, thus needs to flee as well. They meet up with Player 2 at the overseer's office or at the vault door and leave as a group.    Possible diifferences to single player, to preserve the survivalist style of the game: - You can only max your tag skills, other skills are capped at 60 and you start with a bit lower base statistics and less points per level (which allows for a simple start and a hard late game, even with 3 people). - Skills can be only tagged by one player (with possible exception of small guns, which can be tagged by one player). - Combined Special stat can't bypass 15 (2 player mode) or 20 (3 player mode), to prevent allround characters and improve teamwork. - Reduce carry weight by a significant value, to make it harder (Maybe 50%?). - If one dies, all die. - No companions, duh.  I feel this would preserve the survivalist aspect, like being small and weak in a brutal world, of the game. (Or at least, it would preserve it better, than recruiting two companions, who each can solo win a fistfight against a super mutant behemoth.)  5) Questmarkers/Unvisited Locations: This depends on the quest, most quests shouldn't use questmarkers, but in some instances, such as the example in the video, it's okay to use markers. We can assume that the ranger is skilled in reading maps and might even have some technical expertise. Marking known location, listed in NCR documents, on an interactive map should match his skillset. But some random guy shouldn't be able to mark the exact location of a hidden shed on a hillside.  6) Crafting...: ... needs to be improved and I think your proposed system would be nice.   7) Ghoulification: I'd love it and hoped to get ghoulified the second I saw the first ghoul on my first playthrough of Fallout 3. The WSG quest gave me the hope to get additional radiation based perks, ending is ghoulification, but I was disappointed.    I assume a ghoul system could be easily implemented, given Bethesda's experience with vampirism, perks regarding it and people reacting to it in the TES series of games.  Level Design:    1) Windows: That would be nice, maybe it's feasible with the new generation consoles, and houses wouldn't need their own loading zone, so the game would play much smoother.    2) Invsible walls...: ... are weak level design. On my first playthrough of NV I got stuck between two invis walls on Black Mountain and only got out with the dev console. And the invisible walls shielding of the DC ruins were a nuisance as well.    3) Houses: Ever wondered, who barred all those houses? I doubt the owners were like: 'Bombs are dropping, better nail my door shut.' And in the post-apocalyptic world, hammering/shooting nails into a house wall draws attention. So why are so many unharmed buildings in Fallout unaccessible? There is even a house on the northwest side of Vegas, where they used a much better solution.    Well, that's basically all I got for now, might post another wall of text later.    Edit: Fixed some of the errors... shouldn't write when tired. =D"
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,dabisnit,13,Sun Jun 7 09:02:36 2015 UTC,"On the companions YOLO charging - happened to me my very first FO3 playthrough. I'd just met Paladon Star. She sounded cool. She was being nice to me. She acted like a calm, collected badass. Of course I took her towards Vault 87.  Fifteen minutes later, there's a deathclaw in the distance. It must remind her of an ex-boyfriend, because she decides to rambo it. Her head comes off. I don't have an auto-save since I left the Citadel, so thus Star died. It was just annoying, really."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,bolsey,7,Sun Jun 7 17:06:09 2015 UTC,I really dissagree with number 3. When I was playing Skyrim I wanted to recharge my Azura/Black Star on someone in Whiterun who wasn't a guard. It took me forever to find someone who wouldn't die and wasn't useful to me. I couldn't kill someone's wife for some reason and she called the guards on me.   Fortunately I play on PC where I can fix that but everyone should be killable. I really liked how I could kill someone and fail a quest because I'm a little trigger happy.
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Ilitarist,3,Mon Jun 8 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"Skyrim was really weird on how they used the essential tag. Some characters were essential for no real reason, but then there were some quest givers who could be gobbled up by dragons at any time. I hated that the leaders of the various war camps were marked essential even after you'd finished the civil war plot. Why can't I secure my victory by slaughtering the remaining rebel camps?"

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,dabisnit,0,Sat Jun 6 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"Skyrim used ""essential"" tags to liberally, but main quests need some kind of protection. Being able to kill everyone is only viable in sandbox games, not games with a main story line."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,RealFoxD,4,Sat Jun 6 23:21:56 2015 UTC,Why not? Say you kill the people in charge of the water purification system. Then The Enclave could get in touch with you (I don't know if this is how it works in Fallout 3)  Kill Caesar and you cannot help the Legion anymore. Everyone else will still work with you.   It is not only viable for Sandbox games
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,QT_Luna,3,Sun Jun 7 00:52:48 2015 UTC,"With good Legion reputation, you can murder Caesar during brain surgery and convince the Legion it was an accident, and that is beautiful.  In Fallout 3 you have to work for Lyons' BoS to finish the main quest, there are no other factions you can ally with.  It's the lack of choice and consequence that makes a quest need protecting (and the game breaks itself to do so)."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Electric999999,2,Sun Jun 7 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"Skyrim has ""important"" or something tag. It basically means that character is ""almost"" immortal. Most companions have it. Once their health is reduced to 0 they just fall and become inactive for some time. They still can be killed by AoE spells or something but enemies would not attack them. Nothing stops you from killing them.  And say all what you want about Skyrim, but thanks to world being much less restricted than F3/FNV characters really needed protection. Dragons, vampires and cultists killed characters I haven't even met. I sometimes walked into a town, went into tavern and strolled through the streets and suddenly QUEST FAILED: SOME QUEST YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT. Turns out bloody vampire lord has decided to visit town and kill some dude. It'd work better in randomized game but with predefined characters it'd really frustrate players."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,SuperButton,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"Lore-wise there would be an unkillable character (or do they just respawn generic Enclave personnel) and if the quests would be given via a terminal, it would be repetative if used all the time (in case you use this for all quests).    I know that it's doable, but it would be bad game design. The Yes Man solution is the best generic main quest giver method I can think of, but would you say it's a good element, if used in every Fallout game in the future to some extent? I think it would feel unnatural."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,forgodandthequeen,4,Sun Jun 7 00:19:21 2015 UTC,I think Yes Man is a fantastic option. Something like that coule be used in every game without it getting stale.

One, it makes lore sense, because it's established that Benny was trying to take over the Mojave for himself, so why can't the Courier?

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,autowikiabot,2,Sun Jun 7 11:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, for NV it is a geat solution, but if they start reusing the concept of an unkillable software in FO4, FO5, FO:ME, FO6, FO:Bejing and FO7 to be your emergency quest giver, it might get old.  I talk about the concept, not the specific character Yes Man. Also, in the end this is a thread about your wishes for FO4, and as far as I'm concerned, being able to kill everyone would be great, but there needs to be a fail safe and I don't like to see the same concept used again."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,EzekielTombs,2,Sun Jun 7 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"You could kill anyone you wanted in morrowind and in fallout new vegas, it's clearly doable if the devs are willing to bother, and it makes for a much better game. Especially as a lot of parts of a main quest could be bypassed if you know what to do, maybe have a message telling you failed any relevant quests and if they are part of the main story you get a new quest saying X has died, looks like I need to find a way to do Y without their help, maybe add a vague note pointing in a possible direction as a diary on their corpse. If they were going to help you fix something it might have a list of parts and you would need to raise your repair skill high enough to do it yourself, if they were helping you find something it could say that they think it's somewhere northwest of a known location etc."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Martient712,5,Sun Jun 7 01:16:51 2015 UTC,"I very wholeheartedly agree with Morrowind's concept of 'essential tags' - none. They don't exist (as far as I know). However, when you kill a quest-essential character the game warns you that the universe you've just created is null and you should revert to a last save. A perfect system, in my opinion. Killing someone important should be possible but come with the burden of essentially dooming your timeline. That's why I want MATN to play Morrowind so bad- you can kill the game's main deities, if you're badass enough."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Electric999999,7,Sun Jun 7 10:22:52 2015 UTC,"Or even just do what NV does already. If you decide to kill Arcade Gannon one day, it tells you that For Auld Lang Syne has failed.

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Sub-Mongoloid,7,Sun Jun 7 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"About your comment on guns. I doubt that Fallout UK would have noticably fewer guns, for the following reasons:    The UK had 2014 6,6 guns per 100 residents, that's nothing comparef to other European countries (45,7 in Switzerland, 31,2 in France and so on) or the US (88,8), but that's still over 4 million guns in total. (Source: Wikipedia) This would assume that the UK didn't stock up on weapons after being at war with the middle east and europe for 25 years. Now we take into consideration that weapons of mass destruction will reduce the population by a big percentage and that people with guns usually win the survival game. There might be fewer guns in the UK, but in a post-apocalyptic world, were people had hundreds of years to salvage weapons and kill others who found guns, there would be enough.    That being said, I'd love to see a European Fallout setting, cause the information about the Resource Wars are sparse and I'd love to see Bethesda's take on a region that had been ravaged even before the bombs fell."

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Stoyon,4,Mon Jun 8 05:36:30 2015 UTC,"I think this statistic includes guns owned by the government (military, police), but those would be without protection after the apocalypse, as you can break into every military complex you find in FO3 and NV.    Speaking of military complexes. I live near the former US armed forces headquarters in Europe in Heidelberg. The guards were always armed with full auto AR-15 variants, from time to time there were tanks parked on the yard and all those shenenigans. Everything guarded only by said guards. I doubt anyone would keep scavengers out once the bombs fell (though the area would be probably annihilated in case of a nuclear war with the US).    The base was closed in 2013, and is now converted to cheap living space, but given the fact that the area was a military base since the late 1930s I'm sure someone will find a stray gun somewere. Just a matter of time.  My point: There are guns everywhere, even if you live in an area with few guns. (Also France is not that far, and London might seem like a good target for raiders. They got no guns.)"

I'd like to think that England turned into a technopolis with way more robots and energy weapons due to a great many garden shed tinkerers so perhaps under that structure basic projectile weapons would be either antiques or useless in the face of advanced defenses.  On a side note, I'm living in Ireland and there army barracks near by where they routinely hold target practice in the afternoon with Steyr Aug's, most everyone out the country has a 12 gauge or two along with some kind of hunting rifle.  When you factor in guns owned illegally by the mob and the legendary stockpiles of IRA arms you begin to see that guns wouldn't exactly be exotic in a Post-Apocalypse Europe, they just wouldn't be as common as in America (God Bless Her)."

Start out with a personality chip ala 'Beneath a Steel Sky' and find a suitable chassis to plug 'em into, then spend your adventure looking for new mods and equipment for interchangeable weapons and skills.  You could balance your character's deficits or double up on them as you saw fit, say; late in the game you realize you've neglected lock-picking, no worries, just dump 1000 caps into the a 'safecracker' program and let your bot do the tumbling, or let your mechanized friend's fists do the talking when your diplomatic build comes up short.  For some variety there would be sections where your robot wasn't allowed to help or even spots where you took over their circuits and controlled them for a spin.  A similar system could work for the weapons as well, like in 'Dead Space 3' you could start with a frame and then build up functions as you saw fit, it would be an interesting way to get around the 'no guns' problem and would shift focus more onto crafting and mods while giving each player a much more unique experience."

I think a better solution would be more general markers, based on the information the NPCs give you. Like, ""Oh, that thing I want is in this vicinity.."" and he marks it on the map, and the marker points to a large outline on the map (like the size of a town or a square mile or something, depending on the situation) and not a specific location. But if the NPC is like, ""Oh, it's in this one specific house in this town here in your map."" the marker points to the house, but disappears inside the house. And if the NPC says, ""Oh, I left the item on the shelf in the bathroom of my house in NPCville."" the marker will be at that location.  BUT, I would like it if the marker didn't point at the items or quest goals - meaning that the items may have been taken, moved or never existed in the first place and the player has to look around for clues or confront the NPC.  In the cases where the marker just points you in the general, vague direction, it can be made more specific by asking around and getting more information from other NPCs. It could be interesting to have NPCs outright lie or spread misinformation about stuff too.  If Bethesda implements stuff like this though they have to be SUPER CLEAR with the player about what to do in situations like that, or else they will be stuck and wonder, ""well what am I supposed to do now..?"""
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,dabisnit,5,Sun Jun 7 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"Regarding the quest markers.    I always thought that the quest giver gives you coordinates for your Pipboy maps, or that they program it them selves.    What would be nice would be to have area markers where the marker only sends you to an area and you would have to speak with people to go the next bit, a bit like those area markers in Borderlands 2.    I realize now that I types this that we want the same thing....    Regarding the firearms skill, in NV you have been traveling the wastes for a long time before the game starts, while being shot in the head could have affected that skill, I always thought that you could handle weapons well were due to some kind of Jason Bourne effect, while your memories may be gone, you are still immediately familiar with guns and how they work. In 3 however I agree with you, the only experience with weapons the wanderer has had when hell breaks loose is a BB gun, yet the are able to handle a 10mm pistol easy"
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,bolsey,3,Sun Jun 7 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree about the ideas involving expanding the faction system. It would make a single storyline a lot more interesting if you had to approach them from a completely different angle. In NV and Skyrim depending on your allegiance you basically did the same quests and the only difference was who you killed.   What if Faction A's end goal was to find a superweapon, and you had to find different ways to get it depending on whether you were a human or had become a ghoul? If Faction B had a completely different end goal than ""find the superweapon first"" or ""defend the superweapon""? What if factions worked at cross purposes rather than just all for the same exact thing?"
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,BairaagiVN,2,Sun Jun 7 19:02:44 2015 UTC,I'd like factions to be in a state of flux.

Apart from all this faction C are opposed to faction A but know nothing about the superweapon so if you have been working with them you do completely different quests, unless you decide to tell them about it in which case they would naturally want to find a way to defend themselves."

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,thirdtotheleft,5,Sat Jun 6 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with being bad at the game. I, like 99.99999% of fallout players, put almost no stock into Barter. And yet my player always has a majority stake in the world's economy. Sure I trade the ease of making it happen for killing a lot of things and just having a ton of loot. And a peaceful character would use barter to gain wealth more easily. But it really doesn't seem like a valid skill unless you're role playing.  Companions should have different roles maybe. Close combat, sniper, repair, scientist. Sure they have those now in fnv with their bonus abilities, but they all still kick ass at combat. Loyalty would be a good change too.  RANDOM EVENTS YES YES! Expand upon them! These make the world feel  so much less empty than new Vegas did. And FNV felt empty to me.  On that same note, more unmarked goodies and fun things. Fallout 3 had a million things no one would tell you about. And I sorely missed this in New Vegas. It's why I prefer 3 personally. Dungeons felt more rich, there were hidden things you could run into at any time. Anything not quest related in FNV is DULL. Oh you said this just after I typed it.  Windows are HARD. A lot of delicate physics depend on the solid closed environment. There are mods for skyrim that have houses with windows. They have to use awful low res visions of the map and even beast computers have a hard time doing it.  I realize this must be a result of how the engine is made. Gta does some real magic with windows in multiplayer. But I think at least fallout could fake it like in the lucky 38 cantina.  TRAINS, INFRASTRUCTURE, MOVEMENT. Characters in fallout are so stagnant. I want to see people that are well armed and venture into the world. You can meet them out there, see them in town inns. It would be so nice.  Quest markets are fine with me. I like the idea of them marking it on your map. Maps still exist from the past, and people have been moving around for 200+ years. Plus not being able to find things frustrates too many people to make it past play tests.  The living world is what I want the most. I agree. And I think it'll improve. It was a huge focus for promoting immersion in skyrim, and I think they'll keep building on that.  OBVIOUS EDIT: More Autosave slots like skyrim. Let's be honest, fallout 4 is gonna be buggy, I can deal with it. But I need 3-4 autosaves and autosaves should happen when I open the pipboy if it hasn't saved in 15."

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Electric999999,3,Sat Jun 6 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"I think your point about New Vegas being more responsive is down to a fundamental difference between 3 and NV.  Fallout 3 missions feel like individual episodes independent of each other. You go to Big Town and they have their own unique set of problems which you can deal with and it changes nothing else. Go to Megaton, sort them out, go to Rivet City etc.  Meanwhile, in New Vegas, each mission felt like a part of a larger narrative. Tracking down the person who sold Boone's wife is due to the influence of the Legion, go to Jacobstown and they're dealing with NCR harassment, the followers of the apocalypse are having to deal with tensions with House and the NCR.  So you can complete a mission in FO3 but the world never seems to change. But I can help track down and free the hostage Powder Gangers taken by the Legion and feel like I'm making a small hit against the Legion.  That's what I hope for in 4. That individual missions, with a few fun exceptions, feel like they are part of a larger narrative and relationship between factions."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,abnormalredditor,3,Sun Jun 7 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"After playing Wasteland 2 I was struck by what I missed the most in Fallout 3 and  NV.

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Syph26,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:58:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, I can think of one instance where there was a rough moral dilemma in FO3, in the end of the Pitt."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Adaninwing,2,Sun Jun 7 08:30:11 2015 UTC,"Re weapon crafting, there is at least one schematic in the game, the Dogtag Fists, although they're very out of the way, and aren't very good.  One thing I'd like to see is make Survival more useful. There's a hell of a lot of recipes for food, and even one or two that need schematics, but they're all pretty much useless compared to stimpacks. I'd like to see crafted foods be a more viable option in 4.  Regarding co-op, I'd enjoy it if it was a drop in system where you take control of your partner's companion, and give each companion an unique play style. Maybe Boone has a sort of bonus type thing for chaining head shots, as an example.  And the final thing I want is a trophy room to show off my gear. Being able to pick up those creepy mannequins that seem to be everywhere, install them in your house, and use them to display all that neat armour that looks dope but you never use would absolutely make the game for me. And of course, weapon racks and stands to show off those unique guns and whatnot you don't use but don't want to sell. Maybe you get more options for your house as your repair skill increases? Sort of similar to the house in Megaton but focused on building rather than buying."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,ZebraShark,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the food stuff is more useful in hardcore mode and survival lets you make poison and use it on melee weapons, most people just don't bother. Also food is far cheaper and more common that stim packs and it doesn't make sense that random food would compare favourably to futuristic medical tech."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Adaninwing,2,Sun Jun 7 10:59:42 2015 UTC,"I think fallout should remain where its supposed to be played as a single player game.  However, there should be some sort of casual co-op option, were if you wanna play casually with a friend for a few hours and mess around having just some fun, then your friend could just spawn as random NPC that they can tweak their appearance/stats slighty or maybe possibly take control of a Follower for awhile.   Basically the co-op is there, not like in Borderlands where it functions as a serious mechanic but, purely has a option so you don't have to take turns with your friend if you wanna fuck around killing everything for a few hours ;)"
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Electric999999,2,Sun Jun 7 12:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'd like a better economy. In Fallout 3 you could steal absolutely anything anyone was holding. This was realistic but meant you could amass huge wealth with little effort and break the game. NV changed this by only allowing you to steal or loot some items and not others, which was a fix but broke realism especially in the case of certain unique variant items.   I'd hope for the A.I. to handle things better, such as if you pickpocket from a store owner they'll be suspicious of you from then on, or will hire extra security so that if you come back it'll be harder to pull off again. They might also raise future prices to make up for their loses or just simply refuse to do business with you.  Add in some things that Morrowind did years ago such as having to go to fences to safely sell certain goods and you have a system that makes thieving something that can be a quick buck but have long-term negative consequences.  Ooh, I also want to ride a brahmin... like a pony on a beach."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Fadman_Loki,2,Sun Jun 7 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"I have an idea about how to waste some money:  Assuming the garage will be a player home, or that there will be many, they should be susceptible to bandit and scavenger attacks! You have a ton of nice stuff in there, so naturally it should be a delicious-looking target for thieves to hit. To remedy this you could spend money on defenses, like protectrons, turrets and Mr. Handies.  The attacks should be increasing in strength, so the first time you get hit it would only be a lone scavenger that happened to find your place. Then you add some defenses, and rumour would spread about your home being certain death for thieves. No one will dare attack you again, until a more powerful group of bandits hears about it and tries again. Then you add more defenses, and the attacks stop until someone else gather a stronger force and hits you again.  If you fail to repel the bandit attacks, you would need to hunt them down and reclaim what they stole. Win or lose-and-reclaim, your badass reputation would spread across the wasteland. Your reputation would also serve to space out the attacks and make them rarer, so this thing wouldn't become tedious for the player.  These attacks would be random and ""encounter-y"" in nature, so it wouldn't be a minigame or a quest in itself, just something that happens. This would weave in many ideas fans have had; a dynamic world, player reputation spread, more stuff to spend money on and more intelligent AI."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,RealFoxD,4,Sat Jun 6 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"While I like the idea, that would be very frustrating. I do want a safe house for storage..."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,Electric999999,3,Mon Jun 8 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would. That's why the attacks would be fewer and fewer the more defenses you have, as less and less bandits dare attack you. The top defense you can buy might be a stealth boy for your whole house, after which you have no attacks anymore.  But yes, the attack frequency would need to be high enough to make buying defenses worthwhile, while also be low enough to not frustrate the player. An equation that might be impossible.  I generally dislike the static nature of loot containers. Why is the PC the only one who thinks of opening them?"

ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,schulzed,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe that could tie in with having your weapon skills matter more, at lower skills your character struggles to handle recoil making firing multiple accurate shots hard and if the skill is really low they may stumble backwards or flinch so you can't do anything, as the skill gets higher it gets less and less noticeable to the point where at 100 guns skill and with sufficiently high strength you would be able to fire almost anything with no issues. Only problem is that this would only really make sense for actual guns, although they could balance it out by making energy weapons and their ammo harder to come by."

Oh, mine is easy to find. It's the ridiculously long one split into two comments.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/2qighs/what_would_you_like_to_see_added_to_fallout_4/"
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,mesocyclonic4,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer:  IF they decide that they need a multiplayer, I think they should do it in a similar way Borderlands did it. Basically the second player joins you as a companion for as long as he wants, the enemys get harder/more and you get slightly more loot and quests count for both players.  As you mentioned that could create hilarious situations, if your co-op buddy is shunned by a faction, and you need to go do stuff for said faction. It could also be a way to complete quests for factions that don't like you very much.    Skills:  I agree with you in tearms of letting the player character suck in certain aspects.  However I think in both Fo:3 and NV it is implied, that you had some level of basic gun training, and that's why you can handle any weapon. In Fo:3 it was training with your dad and in NV it was the fact, that you worked as a currier in the wastes before the game.    Pickpoketing:  For pickpocketing, they could implement a simple minigame, where you have a large bar with markings on it that represent the items in the person's pocket, and you have a fast moving bar, tht you have to stop in order to ""grab"" an item. It might be an overused minigame, but it's perfect for pickpoketing.  Alternatively they could implement a little ""Hot Wire"" style mini game, where you have to remove an item from the person's pocket without him/her noticing it. Add in a timer for good measure, and pickpocket just got a lot more interresting. If you have higher sneak, the timer is more generous.    Appearance:  I think appearance should be a factor in allmost speach and combat.  In town, if a merchant sees you dressed in rugs, he might not want to talk to you, he/she would think the player is not worth the time. In the wastes, if you run around in the same outfit, raiders might try to capture you as a slave and people from larger factions would just ignore you, even if you are slightly vilified with them.  Alteratively if you wear power armor and walk around with a minigun, people might be intimidated by you, which would basically increase your ability to get information or money out of them. If a raider would spot you in the wastes in that get-up, he might not engage because that's just suicide. On the other hand, you might encounter more traps or ambushes."
ManyATrueNerd,38tpqd,SolarMechanic,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"I'm less keen about the appearance point.  I really enjoy being able to dress my character in whatever way I want.

ManyATrueNerd,38umjj,RealFoxD,3,Sun Jun 7 03:55:39 2015 UTC,"While I 100% agree that the mouse and keyboard is a requirement for any competitive shooter, fallout is more RPG and doesn't require twitch reflexes at any point.  In fact I play on PC and use a controller because I find it much more comfortable for long play sessions, holding a wasd position for a few hours and having to hunt out keys on the board gets fatiguing very quickly. I think if you use the mouse and keyboard for Fallout in the cause of playing it better you're scoring a bit of an own goal."

My hands felt fine (and felt just as good after doing a 43:42 run in Skyrim, same principle.)  I think if you need to ""hunt out keys on the board"", it's a matter of needing more practise with the input device.  And if the keyboard's hurting your hands, you need a better board (or to put the keyboard in a more ergonomic place---I have a keyboard tray in my computer desk that keeps it at the right height, but have worked in places that murdered my wrists due to bad ergonomics...but there's no excuse for that on a home gaming rig setup.)"

ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,maartenbbz,2,Sat Jun 6 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"No. I don't care how he roleplays, I just want to see him go through the story.  Personally I think Legion is best for New Vegas, too."
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,forgodandthequeen,7,Sat Jun 6 16:14:48 2015 UTC,Not the female inhabitants of New Vegas.
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,berniens,2,Sat Jun 6 18:18:29 2015 UTC,I'm doing a female character Legion run right now.  We will see them change their tune
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,stormcrown9,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:09:04 2015 UTC,that sounds interesting
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,NukaCooler,3,Sat Jun 6 23:49:01 2015 UTC,Kill everything Ultimate Edition legion playthrough? Yes please.
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,Sheikah_Benji,8,Sat Jun 6 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"I think that a kill everything run would require him to kill all the legion npcs, and prevent him from taking their ending. He'd have to do a yes-man ending like his last KE run."
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,NukaCooler,5,Sat Jun 6 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"Ah true. Maybe ""kill everything"" in the DLCs and ""evil psychopathic legion run"" in the Mojave. We've already seen a yes man kill everything run, I feel something else would eb much more interesting."
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,Dblitzer,2,Sat Jun 6 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"Kill everything except the fort? Conceivably he could kill all the Legion west of the dam before picking up the Mark of Caesar. It would be a bit convoluted of a ruleset, but it works sorta?"
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,First_Man_on_Uranus,3,Sat Jun 6 16:45:04 2015 UTC,I recall at some point Jon said he was redoing kill everything and I think he said he was going to be legion on that.
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,Poggle566,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok.  We'll see then :)"
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,thirdtotheleft,2,Sat Jun 6 21:21:22 2015 UTC,A melee no-stealth run maybe?
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,JackJDF,2,Sat Jun 6 21:02:28 2015 UTC,"For a challenge, why not fists only?"
ManyATrueNerd,38qq8e,RealFoxD,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:42:12 2015 UTC,I believe he said that he want a to revisit new vegas kill everything and possibly go the legion route
ManyATrueNerd,38pzar,ManyATrueNerd,6,Fri Jun 5 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"I loved that scene, when Jeff almost did the splits, it just sounded so comical. And your voices for Jeff and Ted are spot on."
ManyATrueNerd,38pzar,Loudfungus,4,Fri Jun 5 21:47:06 2015 UTC,I think Jeff's antagonizing Ted into the perfect test subject for his love potion.
ManyATrueNerd,38pzar,bolsey,3,Sat Jun 6 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"What is up with these two guys? Are they friends or not? Jeff seems to know Ted very well; he knew exactly what to do to rile him up, even though most people would just find it mildly annoying.  So many questions."
ManyATrueNerd,38pzar,mojave_merc,2,Sat Jun 6 03:57:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure Jeff is as crazy as we think he is. I mean he has a pseudo-friend, can definitely hold a persona, and he seems smart enough to know alchemy isn't a real thing."
ManyATrueNerd,38pzar,Brothernature0,2,Sat Jun 6 04:40:13 2015 UTC,This game looks so fun but i'd just feel so strange playing it myself.
ManyATrueNerd,38pzar,SephirothClone,2,Sat Jun 6 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"I just had a realization that without Jon's mad scientist voice, everything Jeff says would be about 10x creepier. The voice normalizes it a bit. They sound like things a madman would say. Give a normal voice though? Oh man."

ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,RealFoxD,5,Fri Jun 5 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"Sincere apologies, I didn't think about the now resurrected ""leak"" as being a total spoiler. Message heard!"
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,flipflp,8,Thu Jun 4 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i saw a supposed leak from someone claiming to be a Bethesda employee who was fired for leaking info. He posted 11 months ago, and some of his info seemed to line up with the trailer. Now i'm worried that the other info in his post will have spoiled a bit of the game for me."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Sheikah_Benji,13,Thu Jun 4 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"She*  But yeah. I'm avoiding all leaks and info now in the vain hope that all of that is false. It's probably not, in which case this game might SUCK. But I'm still hoping. I don't want to be let down by their creative choices like this."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Martient712,2,Thu Jun 4 12:49:59 2015 UTC,"Same here, though I did peak at the release date schedule and it's surprisingly accurate so here's hoping for that schedule to be true (perhaps earlier!)"
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,zSocrates,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty worried that it seems like that leak may have been legitimate. I'm not too happy with some of the details in it if it is."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,meinherzbrennt42,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"the info they released that was accurate was from that leaked script of the intro. Without going into many spoilers, a good deal of what they said has been shot down numerous times in /r/fallout4. The stuff that wasn't was easily inferred just by knowing lore and the fact that Boston was the likely setting.  Don't worry, it won't have ruined much."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:48:00 2015 UTC,There was a pretty thorough debunking on /r/fallout in the last couple days. I don't think there is cause for alarm.
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,abraxo_cleaner,3,Sun Jun 7 10:07:52 2015 UTC,I'm glad for this.  The only thing that would decease my enjoyment of the coming game would be spoilers.
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Walstiber,2,Thu Jun 4 14:42:16 2015 UTC,I heard they're gonna reveal at E3 that it's actually Fallout 5! It's so good it skips 4 altogether.

ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,SolarMechanic,4,Fri Jun 5 02:32:29 2015 UTC,I wonder if jon has read the    old Reddit threads where somebody was Totally Definitely A Secret Bethesda Employee
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,ozziestig,8,Thu Jun 4 12:57:55 2015 UTC,"I saw it linked too - I saw a few lines. I saw there are certain things that could be true, some that are not compatible with what we've now seen, and stopped reading. The rumours about Boston and MIT and the Commonwealth go right back to Fallout 3's The Replicated Man quest - a fair bit of what I saw could have been clever guess work."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Martient712,2,Thu Jun 4 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"People have been begging for the commonwealth to be the next setting since Fallout 3, so it is feeding fan hope more than anything. Unfortunately the narration aspect turned out to likely be true, as well as protagonist leaks. Those bits of information feel like more than coincidence and that makes the whole thing likely to be true."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,RealFoxD,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"I believed that Elder Scrolls 5 was going to be set on Summerset Isle and feature the Altmer prominently because of the frequent mentions of it in Oblivion's dialogue (by the same voice actor, playing twenty-five different NPCs scattered around Cyrodiil...)  Turns out, that's how the Thalmor got started."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Loudfungus,-1,Fri Jun 5 01:57:56 2015 UTC,"It also said you could only play as a male, which I feel wouldn't happen because Bethesda would get torn to shreds for sexism. I guess we'll just have to see."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Dblitzer,10,Thu Jun 4 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"I don't even think it would be just a claim of sexism. If we're talking about playing a white male, with somewhat of a set storyline..... who is voiced. Is this even Fallout anymore? It wouldn't be a Roleplaying game at that point, just a standard FPS with RPG mechanics.  I get the feeling that's a red line for a lot of Fallout players, and not just Bethsoft/FO3 hating NMA'ers either."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,triangular_cube,4,Thu Jun 4 15:07:42 2015 UTC,I would be frankly amazed if it was male only.
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,RealFoxD,5,Thu Jun 4 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"Well, its going to be dog only, so I dont think the sex is going to matter much."

ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:58:59 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't shock me if Bethesda's alpha build had a male character as playable just so that the devs could interact with their world, but if that's the actual character in the game, then I'm with Dblitzer---it would cease to be truly Fallout at that point.  (and easy on the Bethsoft/FO3-hating NMA'ers.  If we learned anything from New Vegas, it's that Bethesda should leave the writing to the grown-ups; John Gonzalez makes Emil Pagliarulo look like an especially dim-witted child by comparison.)"
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,TOHSNBN,0,Fri Jun 5 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, I can shoot that one down flat out. They cast both a female and a male protagonist. Gonna do my best to not give spoilers, because I'm a research nut, but that one's persistent and apparently a major concern for some people. It's 100% untrue, as was a majority of that post."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,Grandpa_Edd,2,Fri Jun 5 02:51:04 2015 UTC,"All i can think about these fallout posts...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6PbBVTRTl8  I will ignore everything about that game until 2 weeks after relase, then i will check if it runs properly or is a massive turd.  As excited as i am about a new fallout game, watching trailers, reading about rumors, leaks and the like will only degrade the final experience.  I want to enjoy the game, it is like eating a bag full of chips before master chef meal...  that is just wrong. You go in cold and enjoy the experience."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,dabisnit,2,Thu Jun 4 11:24:41 2015 UTC,"Yea best to ignore the most of it. Hell even stuff released by Bethesda should be watched cautiously (although I don't know how much they actually show), not for story spoilers but stuff like locations, creatures and special weapons and equipment are better left as a surprise.   Especially for something like Fallout where exploration is a great part of the game.  I rode the hype train trough when GTA V was coming out and ended up a bit disappointed (in myself mostly) because I knew so much already."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,TOHSNBN,2,Thu Jun 4 11:40:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah did that for Destiny and The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt (the struggles of a cheap gamer). I want to play those games but don't want to pay $60. I don't think Destiny is worth any money now though, but I used to want it."
ManyATrueNerd,38hzxq,RealFoxD,2,Thu Jun 4 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"I want to play those games but don't want to pay $60   Yea... 20 years playing video games and buying them myself, i only payed twice more then 8-10 bucks for a game, most were blow a fiver.  Mass Effect: I had just finished 1 and 2 bought for bottom dollar and ME3 was just relased, bad, bad timing.  GTA V: I waited 3 years for that game, could not add another year on top of that...  And it looks like Fallout 4 will join that list..."

You play as a character rooted in suburbia, your main task? Keeping up with the neighbors, they buy a lawn gnome, you need a lawn gnome launcher. They get a dog, you get a cybernetic dog.   Possible activities include doing dishes, laundry, trips to the market, ""woohoo"", jet, and a med-x addiction."

ManyATrueNerd,38e1eo,czokletmuss,5,Fri Jun 5 02:04:18 2015 UTC,I have a question on your first play through will you have it heavily edited like your kill everything runs or will you be showing everything as you come about? For example skipping to the location of an objective and editing the walking out.
ManyATrueNerd,38e1eo,Droppinbodies,10,Wed Jun 3 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"I'll edit out some stuff - inventory management, walking along a path I've already been down, browsing inventories, etc, but it'll likely have more in it that normal."

ManyATrueNerd,38e1eo,dabisnit,3,Wed Jun 3 20:47:34 2015 UTC,Could this possibly mean a return of the great BritAnt?

ManyATrueNerd,38e1eo,Sandwich247,2,Wed Jun 3 22:56:36 2015 UTC,I'm curious though. I assume you're not going to do a truly blind playthrough and avoid all the promotional materials/gameplay videos for the next several months/a year?

ManyATrueNerd,38e1eo,RealFoxD,2,Wed Jun 3 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"And this---not pre-order bonuses, not hype, not even my own lack of impulse control---is probably why I'll buy the game before launch day and Steam preload.  Like when I bought New Vegas and played that buggy-as-hell, crashes-every-five-minutes Early Access-quality-codebase 1.0 version on October 19, 2010...  ...I didn't want even ONE spoiler from the Internet.

If I'm wrong, it's kind of academic anyway, since we are talking about Bethesda here, and much like Fallout 3, I'd bet a month's rent that it's going to have that Bethesda look and feel (for better or worse, incidentally, since Fallout 3 was a classic example of what should've been a bad game* saved by being just flat-out damn fun to play.)  *this is especially true in light of New Vegas making Fallout 3 look like it had been written by an especially stupid chimpanzee by chimp standards.  And let's face it, the gameplay hasn't aged well---thank the gods for the Tale of Two Wastelands mod for New Vegas."

ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,SuffolksSecretSauce,12,Sat Jun 6 07:13:58 2015 UTC,"Some things I noticed;   Most of the trailers for 3 and New Vegas were from ground level. There was that big whoosh zoom out shot for New Vegas, but apart from that, it was all very horizontal. Compare that to the Fallout 4 trailer (I can't believe I live in a world where I can write that) there's lots of shots from above, lots of tall buildings and airships. All this suggests that there will be a lot more verticality in 4 than before.  Only one gun in the entire trailer, pinned to a wall, and that looks to have weapon mods with it. Again, compare it to NV where Mr Ranger pulls out a thumping great AntiMaterial trifle. And that bobblehead in the garage is the Charisma one. This suggests the Speech path is a priority again, so not just another post-apocalyptic shooty shooty bang bang affair.  The only faction we can see is the Brotherhood. Once again, compare it to the NV trailer, where we see all three main factions within 30 seconds. This suggests a depart from choose a side kingmaking, and more lonesome wandering the wastes.  Finally, optimism! Watch the Fallout 3 trailer, and it's just depressing. Which is valid, there's just been a nuclear war, but 4 looks bright and colourful, and like I say optimistic."
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,forgodandthequeen,8,Wed Jun 3 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"The only faction we can see is the Brotherhood. Once again, compare it to the NV trailer, where we see all three main factions within 30 seconds. This suggests a depart from choose a side kingmaking, and more lonesome wandering the wastes.   We see some people with T-45d power armor, Zeppablimps and Vertibirds. The Brotherhood isn't the only group with those things."
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,kolboldbard,3,Wed Jun 3 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"True, but it would be pretty odd if they put Enclave or Remnants in what's clearly looking like Brotherhood armour, when every previous games has clearly established and honoured the differences in how their armor looks..."
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,kolboldbard,3,Thu Jun 4 09:46:01 2015 UTC,"Could also be US Army Remnants, or possibly the Soldiers of the Institute."
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,Dblitzer,2,Thu Jun 4 16:11:48 2015 UTC,Enclave? Those guys are so 2277. Bostonian Institute Android Death Army T-45 Powah Armah is the new meta around these parts.
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,SolarMechanic,3,Thu Jun 4 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"Hope you're right about the verticality, would be awesome.   There's a few weapons in the trailer, you can see various soldiers holding them though not in great detail but there's also a minigun with a tarp draped over it in the workshop area with ammunition cannisters behind it. Finally the vault dweller has a rifle with mods attached in the last shot. That along with the under-construction power armour hints at an expanded crafting system for weapons and armour."
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,GTS250,5,Wed Jun 3 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"Reposting my comment from /r/falloutlore:  I've got to comment on ""War never changes"" from the trailer.  At first glance, it seems a throwaway line (to verify that yes, this is indeed a Fallout game), but the context seems important to me.  The narrator's exact line is (AFAIK), ""My god. Our soldiers were right. War. War never changes."" He's talking about this with regards to the nuclear apocalypse. That line implies that this has happened before- after all, if war never changes (and the speaker had no idea what life after the bombs was like, as would be the case if that truly was a pre-nuke broadcast), then the speaker had knowledge that people would survive and fight after the bombs had dropped.   That leads me to theorize that the broadcast in the beginning isn't that of some radio operator in the soon to be dying United States, but rather that of some radio operator in a rebuilt society, years after the first wave of nuclear destruction, facing a second round of atomic hellfire. To me, this means we're getting one hell of a story-- a community that rebuilt itself from the roasted ruins, only to be blasted back to ash.   That line, and this train of thought, made me more hyped than anything else in the rest of the trailer. Anyone have thoughts/comments/critiques?"
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,RealFoxD,3,Thu Jun 4 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"Chris Avellone at Obsidian remarked after New Vegas came out that the whole thing felt a little too...clean.  Not post-apocalyptic enough.  The idea of a second revolution, with nukes (Androids vs. Institute?  An appearance by Madison Li?) wouldn't be out of bounds."
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,RealFoxD,2,Thu Jun 4 01:00:51 2015 UTC,The idea that we could have to prevent a SECOND round of nuclear destruction would certainly be a fresh approach!
ManyATrueNerd,38fe0r,GTS250,3,Thu Jun 4 09:47:43 2015 UTC,The writers would have to follow a lonesome road to arrive at that conclusion.

The only reason it works for Saints Row is because that game is linear, with very limited game branches. Think of how many dialogue options there were in New Vegas, and consider that it already holds the world record for most lines of dialogue in a video game at around 65,000 without a voiced main character.  Another issue is that giving the Vault Dweller a voice would negatively affect Mods, which wouldn't be able include the voice actor. And considering how Bethesda has been trying to expand (and monetize) the modding community, it just doesn't seem like a smart choice to include voiced dialogue.  Also, Jon said ""gar-ahj"" like an American. :D"

They'll probably make a set of beast-mode textures that will run on Ultra for high-end machines (if they don't, some modder will, just like every Bethesda game since Morrowind) and embed them in the game itself or, like Skyrim, make them free DLC in order to keep the download reasonable for Steam users with weaker Internet connections.  Speaking of Skyrim, Fallout 4 is going to have Bethesda's style all over it, and that's a big difference from Obsidian/Black Isle's vision of the franchise.  Expect more of that Elder Scrolls-like emphasis on the player interacting only tangentially with the story.  No Mutants Allowed will probably (pun intended) go nuclear and disavow the game from canon.  Subway tunnels.  Lots and lots of subway tunnels.  Born-and-raised Bostonians will nitpick the shit out of the way they do the map on places like...oh, I dunno, Reddit ;)  The Institute androids. Something tells me the nature of humanity's going to play a role in the story.  Big Bad might just be a Dr. Richard Grey type, except instead of building a Super Mutant army for ""the Unity"" like in Fallout 1, it'll be a Terminator ""Rise of the Machines"" type of plot."

Man, Fallout 4 looks a LOT better than Fallout 3, no matter how we bitch about how  it's not the best looking trailer we've seen."

ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Drylanders,7,Wed Jun 3 14:23:05 2015 UTC,Aaaand I just got a reason to either upgrade my computer or finally buy a PS4.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,11,Wed Jun 3 14:34:44 2015 UTC,Upgrade the PC bro. Always.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,SUPERmegaPIEman,4,Wed Jun 3 14:36:36 2015 UTC,And don't preorder.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,hopsafoobar,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:44:49 2015 UTC,"We'll see. My PC is from 2009, but was pretty powerful when for when I got it (quad core 3ghz processor, 8gb of ram) and I stopped playing new PC games around 2011-2012 (went to grad school).   This is basically the only game I've seen that really makes me want to play. I much prefer PC for fallout (that's where I played fallout 3 and NV), but by the time I look at upgrading, I'm looking at bringing my computer 7 years ahead - aka I need a full rebuild. New mobo, ram, processor, video card, the whole shebang. To do it a little above entry level, you're looking at around $1000. To play one game.   Or I could probably pick up a PS4 for $249 this holiday season."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,2,Wed Jun 3 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"Not... not really, not anymore. If you've got a good PSU and case, you might spend $550 if you want a good mid/high end build. It's still DDR3, your storage would still be good (though you could pick up an SSD), and Windows 10 is a free upgrade from 7/8.   That's a better build than what I spent $1k on a year ago, for half of that.

ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,3,Wed Jun 3 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was assuming you'd be reusing the old components (case, psu, CD drive, who the hell even uses wireless on a desktop, they're all backwards compatible). Ram would be like $50, you don't need your brother to do it for you (older computers, maybe, but now it's big ol' copper infused legos).  Gimmie 15 minutes, I'll try and find the build I was working on for my sister- it should be easily within your price range."

I think I would need a new case, though, because the current computer came pre-assembled from HP. It's pretty cramped in there. Though I did manage to get an upgraded power supply in there."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,2,Wed Jun 3 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"So, most of that build wasn't available for sale/had gotten more expensive, so I threw something together.

I got you a case with good quality, a GPU that is roughly equivalent to mine (I run GTA V at high settings 1080p60), and I'm assuming you're using the psu you talked about. This is a good mid-level build by any standards. Next would be to throw in an SSD (850 EVO would be a good option), because that just makes load times vanish.

ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,GTS250,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:47:54 2015 UTC,It won't cost that much if you just want a PS4-level computer.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,mattinthecrown,6,Wed Jun 3 15:01:06 2015 UTC,Yeah but then what's the point? I have a computer that functions perfectly well for every non-gaming thing I would ever want it to do. So it's not completely insane to just buy a dedicated gaming machine that I won't likely have to troubleshoot.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,3,Wed Jun 3 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. It's just a lot easier and cheaper to get a PS4 at this point. My computer is already overworked as it is. Besides, if you're happy playing the game vanilla anyway, then I doubt you're really missing out on too much by skipping the PC version."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,mojave_merc,3,Wed Jun 3 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"For me the main draw of the PC is the keyboard and mouse control setup. It was less important in skyrim because you're using melee weapons much more frequently, but the difference for guns is crazy.   Jon is a master sniper with the controller, but I cannot do the same."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that a good PC can also handle the graphics and everything (admittedly, FNV is frustrating to play on PS3; I'm constantly crashing or lagging) as well. I think there's something to be said for the challenge of using limited controls, too, when you don't have access to a keyboard.  I respect PC users and see the benefits of PC, but it's just never really been an option for me. Maybe someday, when I have a better system."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,mojave_merc,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"Is fallout the only thing you'd ever play?  Because games on steam are a shit ton cheaper than PS4 games.  Also, it never hurts to have an upgraded computer.  Lastly, don't forget mods, man."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,mattinthecrown,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"Fallout is the first game in a long time that has made  me really want to play something. And I'm not buying lots of games new, so if I had to drop full price on one game, I wouldn't die."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:33:05 2015 UTC,Maybe all you might need to do is upgrade your GPU
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,dabisnit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"Wait until the specs are released. Quad-core 3ghz with 8gb RAM isn't too bad, so you might just need a new graphics card. Again, we won't know until the specs are revealed."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,ZeldaZealot,2,Wed Jun 3 15:08:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The processor is a AMD Phenom II X4 945, which was released in 2009. Though it wasn't awful then, I suspect the newer chips significantly outclass it."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"Most certainly, but Bethesda has scaled their games pretty well, so you might be able to get away with minor upgrades if you don't mind lower settings."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,ZeldaZealot,2,Wed Jun 3 15:26:14 2015 UTC,Well then wouldn't it be smarter to just buy the dedicated gaming system that can play it better?
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"Given the specs of the current-gen, I don't think you could run it much better. Besides, I view PC games as an investment. Even if I can't play it perfectly now, I know I will be able to down the line. With a console, you are stuck at that performance forever. It's entirely your choice, though."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,ZeldaZealot,2,Wed Jun 3 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"Bethesda games always seem to run pretty well on ""decent"" hardware.  If you implement some of the high-def texture mods though, then you are pushing needing something more top-of-the-line gaming machine."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,mschwartz33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:18:15 2015 UTC,Indeed. My mid-range PC from 2010 could run Skyrim on medium no problem. I have no doubts that I'll be able to run this on decent settings on my new PC.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,ZeldaZealot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"I guess that depends on how much interest you invest in mods.  Mods is what keeps me playing Fallout 3/NV again and again and again.  A friend of mine also mentioned how awful New Vegas was at load screen time, which I never saw on the PC version."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,mschwartz33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Like I said, I much prefer the PC side. I don't go too crazy into mods but I definitely played around with some graphical upgrades. But for the initial release, Bethesda's work will probably be pretty good, at least."
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:17:59 2015 UTC,I have plans of getting a PS4 for this.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,robblatt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:22:43 2015 UTC,I'm having a hard time believing it'll be THAT much harder on the system than Skyrim was---my 2010-issue machine might just be able to handle it on medium-high given a video card upgrade if that's the case.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,RealFoxD,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:49:33 2015 UTC,Go for the PC. Bethesda games have a harsh history on Sony consoles.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,SolarMechanic,2,Wed Jun 3 14:49:29 2015 UTC,Does it really? I played Skyrim on PS3 without any problems other than the usual Bethesda glitches.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Daveaa005,2,Wed Jun 3 14:54:47 2015 UTC,How long after launch? The game was basically unplayable for at least 6 months after release. More that the typical Bethesda hiccups.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,SolarMechanic,5,Wed Jun 3 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"Quite a while after launch. I grabbed it on sale for $20. I'm quite behind on game releases because of grad school, so I've been living a great life by playing old games that are still awesome. Have you guys heard of Borderlands 2? It's great!"

ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Fadman_Loki,11,Wed Jun 3 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"That worries me, especially since it seems to be Troy Baker. Nothing against the man, he's a talented actor, but he's over saturated. Although I assume there must therefore be a female voice as well! Wonder who it might be?"
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,SolarMechanic,8,Wed Jun 3 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"Moira Brown's voice actor, except with a Bostonian accent this time...  Ha ha...I'm sorry."

ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,SolarMechanic,4,Wed Jun 3 15:31:27 2015 UTC,Maybe FemShep's voice actor.
ManyATrueNerd,38dcpg,Fadman_Loki,2,Wed Jun 3 14:59:42 2015 UTC,I've got nothing against the player having a voice. I'm guessing it'll be like Saints Row and have several male and several female choices.

Not sure if it's intentional or not or even whether I like it but I do think all the Fallout games so far and their ugly ugly graphics have somehow never detracted from the gameplay.

The lineage of Fallout 1/2/New Vegas was always its own universe with its own set of rules and its own history, and I think Bethesda's attitude is ""never the twain shall meet"", with the exception of the Brotherhood of Steel (which got its own story about how it crossed the country that leaned pretty heavily on the broad-strokes-canonical events from Fallout Tactics) and the ""national"" organizations with ties to the original apocalypse (Enclave, Vault-Tec...)  Which, incidentally, has a lot to do with one of the Internet's most interesting feuds, namely the faction that says Fallout 3 (and probably 4) aren't ""real"" Fallout since they're only very, very loosely connected to the universe from the original games vs. the one that says ""get your head out of your ass, it's still Fallout."""

ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,forgodandthequeen,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:08:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry now. That big a feature would have been shown off in the trailer, and there was no hint of it."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Lolita_Humbert,0,Sat Jun 6 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Wasn't ESO only published and overseen by Bethesda Softworks? Nothing that their game studios have done or made directly in the last 15 years has shown anything less than amazing quality and polish, not to disregard respect for their clientele with the autonomy they give the players with the modding tools. I have zero intentions of worrying about anything until 16h from now."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,triangular_cube,2,Tue Jun 2 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"Bethesda Softworks, Bethesda Game Studios, and ZeniMax Online are all just subdivisions of ZeniMax Media. They are all heavily interconnected, and have relatively little distinction aside from whatever softboundaries the internet wants to dream up to pretend their favorite series is immune to the company's overall direction."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Martient712,0,Wed Jun 3 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"Rather, the game studio itself is the only one with actual developers. While a company direction does much to influence such a large product, the game studio has quite a lot of autonomy itself. That's been demonstrated in plenty of interviews and behind the scenes looks."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Aduckonquack97,2,Wed Jun 3 06:47:31 2015 UTC,Jon's worrying is unwarranted. Did Skyrim have micro transactions? Did Wolfenstein: The New Order have them (btw Jon totally play TNO). No Bethesda title released recently I can think of has them.
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Perry87,2,Tue Jun 2 19:44:42 2015 UTC,The micro transactions I'm worried about are the mods. They tried with Skyrim and it didn't go over well but I'd be surprised if they didn't try again at launch with another title
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Aduckonquack97,2,Tue Jun 2 20:16:50 2015 UTC,I've be surprised if they did. They repealed it because of the outcry from a fan base over a 3 year old game. I can't imagine the outcry from a brand new one 5 years in the making.
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,triangular_cube,5,Tue Jun 2 20:39:59 2015 UTC,"The outcry was because Skyrim already had a strong modding community. If introduced at its infancy during a hyped release, Bethesda would have no real opposition to monetizing mods."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Troggie42,2,Wed Jun 3 03:05:19 2015 UTC,Fallout has a pretty big mod community too...
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,triangular_cube,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:09:14 2015 UTC,"Do you really believe so? The modding community already exists, and even though the game may be new, I'm quite sure a lot of people would heavily opose this idea."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,Aduckonquack97,2,Wed Jun 3 03:12:54 2015 UTC,"People will oppose it, but they will buy the game regardless. There wont be an organized front against it from an established F4 mod community. Monetized mods will thrive, as the old fallout mod community will stick with F3NV instead of dealing with the BS."
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,GTS250,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:20:23 2015 UTC,That's not true. New Vegas and 3 have strong free modding communities. To say that fans will expect anything less than that for the new Fallout is preposterous.
ManyATrueNerd,388gw7,SephirothClone,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there, the first thing I said when I saw the trailer is ""there's gonna be a hell of a lot of mods."" The textures aren't that great (while the animations and shaders are pretty awesome), and that's going to be fixed within weeks of release."

ManyATrueNerd,387n8w,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:19:32 2015 UTC,"So long as you take the next part slow and sneak the entire way, it's not so bad.  The ghost people in the next part tend to stick in groups of 1 or 2, so a proper sneak attack will bring the battles down to nothing or one on one.  There's only one instance I can think of with three, and that's in the wine cellar, and they're all bear trap guys.    Alternatively, you could use the snowglobe to buy a handful of demo charges and, if you know the spawn locations (I was never that dedicated), you could drop 3-4 mines on the ghost people's spawn locations for easy clean up."
ManyATrueNerd,384do3,ManyATrueNerd,4,Mon Jun 1 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited this series is back! This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I love your commentary on it.  A few months ago I beat the 1999 mode (on top of not using ANY vending machines for the other achievement), and it really wasn't that bad. There were maybe one or two parts (Lady Comstock and the final battle) that were actually a pain, but doable in the end.  I also have no proof of this concept - but I feel like whenever I had low money Elizabeth would find me tons, and I'd also find more while looting. Whenever I had a lot on me (when hoarding or saving up for future purchases), I wouldn't find much around. I decided to spend a ton of my money ASAP in my last play-through and I ended up owning every single vigor upgrade and a ton of the weapon upgrades by the time you get to the part where you rescue Elizabeth near the end. Not sure if that helps at all, but I wouldn't worry too too much. The difficulty isn't that bad honestly."

As for the holograms, the gambling area ones are simple.  Climb the stairs, hop the rails and there's one emitter.  The emitter for the closet guard you can just chuck a grenade at.  The security room hologram...bit trickier, but there's a computer where you can change its patrol so that you'll have a few second to run in and disable its emitter.

ManyATrueNerd,37zs6t,czokletmuss,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:27:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would avoid fighting Elijah altogether.  Much to my surprise, you don't have to wait to sneak away.  As soon as he's done talking to you, I opened the door and snuck back out the way I came, but as soon as I was out of the general ""vault""ish area, I stood up and started bolting.  I was able to run back to the elevator before Elijah started his little speech.  Easy peasy, and if you kill the three holograms beforehand, no risk."

I'm confident now that if you survive triggering the gala event in next episode we will see you confront Ulysses.  That is if you survive the elevator ride in Lonesome Road - despite being almost at max level and with the best gear in game, I still had to burn through a shitload of stimpaks to make it. Tunnelers ain't a joke."
ManyATrueNerd,37zs6t,LutrianH,4,Mon Jun 1 07:51:53 2015 UTC,"I just have no clue how he can get through that helter skelter from hell. Enemies literally spawn on top of you, and no companion meat shields. It's a great piece of level design, and the overall effect of the thing is glorious. But I just don't think it can be done without losing health."
ManyATrueNerd,37zs6t,Fadman_Loki,2,Mon Jun 1 08:13:23 2015 UTC,Me neither. Deathclaws are ridiculously dangerous but at least they tend not to spawn in herds and usually can be taken out from a distance. They may do you a lot of damage but 5-6 tunnelers who spawn few metres from you and who you have to fight alone in close quarters with no place to maneuver or use explosives without risking splash... They will just fucking rape you. If Jon survives this than the rest of the DLC shouldn't be a problem.

This would either kill them or leave them with 10-20 HP while they struggled to get up again. Two problems with that. Knock-Knock can only be found in Searchlight, and P.D.Shoot has 12 in Melee."

I died several times in the process but in the end I somehow managed to prevail.  By the way, there is radiation everywhere in ""Lonesome Road"" - including this damned elevator. Honestly, if Jon surives this on his first and only attempt I will be impressed - I mean, just look at this nightmare. Within five seconds after walking into the room this guy took at least 50 dmg from ONE tunneler - and there is like a dozen of them in there."

ManyATrueNerd,37zs6t,sixkiller5,4,Mon Jun 1 08:13:00 2015 UTC,Yes ... Most of the time in dead money if you are really observant you can find the radios.  Many times I have blown myself up then gone back and seen the hints that had been left - that I had missed.  DM is very good but it does require a lot of patence; I really like all the DLC because they are all so different.

ManyATrueNerd,37dbcc,Qwarr,2,Tue May 26 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"@ManyATrueNerd,  I have had a brilliant idea. You should do a Cooking with Jon, and Cook the two recipes from the Fallout 1 and 2 manual,  Mushroom Clouds and Desert Salad.  Mushroom Clouds  (preheat oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit)  3-4 egg whites (at room temperature), cocoa, 1/4 tsp cream of tartar, 8 oz dark chocolate, 1 cup superfine sugar* (bittersweet or semi-sweet)  Beat the eggs and tartar with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add the sugar a little at a time while continuing to beat, until all the sugar is in and the mixture is glossy and stiff. Using a piping bag with a no. 8 tip, pipe out an equal number of caps and stems onto an ungreased non-stick cookie sheet. The caps should be about the diameter of a quarter, and the stems should be about an inch high and the diameter of a soda straw.  Sprinkle cocoa over the caps and stems, and then blow on them to spread out the cocoa more evenly. You may want to do this outside, as cocoa goes everywhere. Bake for 2 hours at 200 degrees. Carefully remove the caps and stems from the cookie sheet. With a dull knife, snip the top of each stem so it has a flat top surface. Melt the chocolate (in a double boiler or microwave). Spread the chocolate on the base of each cap with a butter knife or spatula, and use it to glue a stem in place. Put the assembled mushrooms in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to harden the chocolate, then put them in an airtight container. Makes 3-4 dozen.  Desert Salad  1 lb. extra lean ground beef  6 oz. tortilla chips  1 firm tomato  1/2 head of iceberg lettuce, cut  1 16oz. bottle of Catalina dressing  3 oz. pinto beans  6 oz. sliced olives  1 avocado (optional)  4 oz. cheddar cheese  Brown the meat, drain. In large bowl, mix lettuce, beans, and olives. Crush chips and add. Cut tomato into small chunks and add to bowl. Shred cheese and add. Slice avocado and add. Add meat. Toss with dressing. Serve."
ManyATrueNerd,37dbcc,lolnochill,4,Wed May 27 04:49:43 2015 UTC,"It's funny how the recipe calls for pinto beans, and there are pinto beans in the Mojave Wasteland (found growing in that Fire Gecko and Lakelurk infested portion of the southeast corner of the map below Cottonwood Overlook on the other side from Cottonwood Cove, and also in greenhouses at the NCR Sharecropper Farms)...  ...but the crafting recipe contains no pinto beans at all, using pinyon nuts instead.  Not sure where the barrel cactus fruit is supposed to fit into all that, but it apparently tastes a bit like Nuka-Cola, and now I'm confused."
ManyATrueNerd,37dbcc,TotesMessenger,3,Wed May 27 06:43:03 2015 UTC,You might want to convert to metric for those unintelligent non-'Muricans.

ManyATrueNerd,37471z,LeapingMudcrab,8,Sun May 24 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"This one I practised like crazy with other save files - just because DM is basically memory - remember the street layouts, remember the routes around the cloud, remember the radio locations.  The throwing spears... I feel like I'm lacking a choice. There will be crowds of Ghost People. I can't stealth them all. If I have to prioritise, I'll take out the seekers to avoid gas bombs, and just keep strafing given Ghosts struggle to nail you with spears if you aren't still.  And hope. Lots of hope."
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,EzekielTombs,9,Sun May 24 20:37:08 2015 UTC,Just outside the room where you turned on the second hologram for Dean there were several micro fusion cells on the ledge. I don't know if you wanna risk going back but...

ManyATrueNerd,37471z,acksed,9,Sun May 24 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a weakness of mine - when there are active enemies around, I rush, and miss things.

ManyATrueNerd,37471z,dabisnit,5,Sun May 24 19:18:23 2015 UTC,Very impressed that you made it through without taking a single point of damage! Nice one.
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,NoOneImportant4,5,Sun May 24 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"Jon Jon Jon.  You were literally looking right at the holotape for the Automatic Rifle mod, and you didn't pick it up.  Tsk tsk tsk.  Well, even though you missed the Automatic Rifle mod, you'd be remiss to pass over the Holorifle mods.    I gotta say, you got REALLY lucky in your fights with the ghost people this time around.  It is, as I said though, Dean Domino's 9mm is really good for taking them out.  Really good.  He tanked pretty well too, what a trooper.    You might also consider grabbing more pre-war money from the hologram vendors.  Though you don't really need them for currency, you can trade the pre-war money you get for more chips once inside the casino, which means more mines and ammo.    Since you already cleared out all the ghost people, Christine's part of the quest is gonna be super simple next week.  Even if you don't know where all the radios are, you can Implant GRX past them."
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,dabisnit,3,Sun May 24 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt the luck can hold through the run to the Tower - there are just too many enemies, and I didn't get lucky with a stealth boy draw. I have no idea what I'll do there..."
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,NoOneImportant4,3,Sun May 24 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"Hm, if there's one silver lining to the tower, it's that the ghost people don't clump up much.  You're usually fighting them one at a time, sometimes two at a time.  This is amazing for sneak attack criticals, usually you can just take the single out, and turn the double into a single.  The wine cellar has three bear trap guys, but given that they are purely melee, they pose little threat.    If you can, scrounge around for those drained microfusion cells.  Even if you don't go with max charge, over charge cells might still be enough for one shot kills.    You might also consider something I've been pondering.  If I've been reading right, the lethal Cloud Kiss poison does 150 damage over ten seconds.  If I'm not mistaken, at level 34 the ghost people should have around 150-225 HP, which means one poisoned spear thrown, then running away, could kill a ghost person outright.  But, if I'm still reading this right, when you hit level 35, their HP will go up to 250-375, which 150 off of that is still not bad at all."
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,anikm21,1 point,Sun May 24 20:49:28 2015 UTC,Would the poisoned spear knock off a limb to kill the Ghost People if the poison was the thing that killed?
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Sun May 24 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"Doubtlessly not.  But, once a ghost person is down, chopping them up with a cosmic knife is a simple matter."
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,anikm21,1 point,Sun May 24 23:52:44 2015 UTC,doubtlessly not   Translation? That's a lot of negatives
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Sun May 24 23:59:54 2015 UTC,I don't see any way that poison would remove a limb.

ManyATrueNerd,37471z,acksed,1 point,Mon May 25 12:30:36 2015 UTC,Is he really going to buy more than 120 of those? Also after dead money he gets infinite caps if he gambles so that's irrelevant as well.
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Mon May 25 18:53:50 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be hard to go through 120.  I've thrown down 50-60 and still not killed every ghost person that spawns.  If I knew where they spawned that'd be different.

ManyATrueNerd,37471z,NoOneImportant4,3,Sun May 24 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"As far as the gold goes, here is what I usually do:  When you enter the vault, immediately to your right will be two empty metal boxes.  I stuff almost all my stuff in there, so I do the vault with only a police pistol and some frag grenades on me.  With Strong Back and Burden to Bear, I usually am able to carry 9 gold bars with me.  Then, right before I take the elevator, I grab my stuff and slow walk out."
ManyATrueNerd,37471z,Fadman_Loki,1 point,Sun May 24 20:59:01 2015 UTC,I think you can put the gold into a suitcase and carry it out with the Z key...

ManyATrueNerd,37471z,WholeWheatJesus,1 point,Mon May 25 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't think so, but I wasn't sure.  Off the top of my head, the only carryable storage containers are those boxes, you know the ones, they're either explosives crates or sarsaparilla crates.  Even then, they'll despawn after a while if you move them out of their area.    That aside, I don't think there is a carryable storage container in the vault.  Well, aside from Father Elijah's dead body, buuuuut, you don't exactly have all the time in the world to position his limbs where you want them.  There are a couple of buckets in the vault that you can pick up and move, and I was wondering if it'd be possible to drop the gold into the bucket and carry the bucket, but I haven't tried it yet."

Is he completely mental or maybe he is right and there are witches out there, I mean there are ghosts and psychics. Maybe there is a devil granting powers and the bell killer is just targeting the wrong people. Maybe the symbol is something to seal/prevent a witch from becoming a ghost?"
ManyATrueNerd,37134g,SolarMechanic,1 point,Sun May 24 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"There's some dodgy logic going on with the butcher. He implies that he sold his victims meat from his shop but then also says he used pigs to do the killing. But pigs don't leave much behind when they feed, it's why they're supposedly so useful for disposing of bodies, so he wouldn't have had much left to sell.  Unless he fed the pigs on human then killed them and sold them, but I doubt that would have much effect on the flavour unless they were fed exclusively on people all their lives in which case he would have to be killing folks daily for years to build a reputation.  Nah, don't buy it."
ManyATrueNerd,37134g,iiRockpuppy,2,Sat May 23 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"I think the latter explanation is the reason why the butcher killed that lady's kid, just another way to provide his pigs sustenance. An albeit extremely lengthy and risky way to feed his pigs which, at this point I would have to assume, was only to get a fucked up thrill out of killing people."

Now that he's been kicked out of the house, nobody will know how to use David's technology effectively.   It's a very interesting dilemma, but I still think it's very wrong that David kept his information to himself. But is David's secrecy enough of a reason for Chloe and Max to give up a reliable resource?   Approaching David with the option to set aside their differences and team up would have been the best scenario, but they're both pretty stubborn so we all know that wouldn't happen."

ManyATrueNerd,36w7et,iiRockpuppy,1 point,Sat May 23 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Meditations:       Meditations (Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, Ta eis heauton, literally ""thoughts/writings addressed to himself"") is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor 161–180 CE, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy.  Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek  as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement.  It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum. It is not clear that he ever intended the writings to be published, so the title Meditations is but one of several commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.

My scale of time might be off though, I tend to beat the DLCs in one or two long sessions each, plus it's been a long time since I did Dead Money, and even then I had the luxury of healing.

ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,ManyATrueNerd,25,Sun May 17 19:52:45 2015 UTC,"Not picking up the skill books is killing me, Jon.  You passed right over a Dean's Electronics, and the Pugilism Illustrated should still be right behind the fountain.    But, I have good news!  And a bit of bad.  The good news is that I spent today going through my third Dead Money run in recent memory and I am just before entering the vault and I have taken only 18 damage from fighting ghost people.  Even better news, I have discovered that the creators of the game were nice enough to put in routes where you don't have to touch the thick cloud at all.  No Turbo, no Dean Domino needed, you can get past all the thick cloud no problem, and I have a bunch of saves so I can screenshot these routes upon request.    The bad news is that I tried out Demolition Charges and they are awful.  At least without any Explosives perks.  I must have laid twenty or so down and it only killed a couple of the ghost people.  Although, combining Demo Charges with Gas Bombs is a bit more effective.    Also, to your question from before, Jon:  When coming down from the tower, you want to go right.  Straight ahead goes into the thick cloud, and the left path loops around behind the thick cloud, so you don't want that.  Hopefully you'll randomly pick up a Stealth Boy to use to get down from there (I randomly picked up three lol)."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,NoOneImportant4,10,Sun May 17 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting - Demolition charges are functionally identical to frag mines, so shouldn't be that bad - about 6 should be able to kill a ghost person - and if I get to the casino, affording bundles of 6 should be easy..."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,NoOneImportant4,4,Sun May 17 21:20:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  I didn't bother to bundle them, but they are fairly expensive.  I think it was 75 chips per mine?  If you break the bank you'll be able to afford them no problem, but it'll also eat up a lot of your Pre-War Money profits.  Not that I suspect you give a rip about the Pre-War Money at this point, since all you've got left is Lonesome Road.    What I ended up doing was just randomly laying 15-20 Demo Charges in the main entrance to the casino (where all the ghost people spawn).  First spawn it worked fairly well, but it only spawned a few of them.  On the third spawn, it left 4-5 of them still alive.  So if you're gonna do overkill, doing it before the third spawn is the way to go.  The first two spawns are manageable.    Though, I also didn't lay any of the C-4 you pick up...C-4 might have made the difference.  I usually save the C-4 for Elijah, but I imagine you're just gonna trap him in the vault, since it's easier and safer."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,NoOneImportant4,3,Sun May 17 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"Once chips become plentiful, I think those bastard foyer spawning Ghosts will have to be dealt with by mining the hell out of the staircase, and tonnes of automatic rifle ammo, plus abusing the load zones if things get dicey..."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,NoOneImportant4,6,Sun May 17 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"The order you deal with your companions matters here as well, I think.  If you mine the staircase to China and back and you come out of the elevator from dealing with Christine, the splash damage might reach you.  It's not a risk I was willing to take, so before I went to deal with Christine, I made sure the mines were a bit further away.  Alternatively, you could just do Christine first.  I suggest doing Dean Domino last."

Now that I've 100% confirmed that Implant GRX is not needed at all."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,thirdtotheleft,4,Sun May 17 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'm taking GRX anyway - if I have to run, it could save my life to get some extra distance between me and the Ghosts..."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,NoOneImportant4,4,Sun May 17 22:02:53 2015 UTC,"Hm...Well, as a bonus, GRX stacks, so if you use all five doses all at once, you'll have a good, long time to sprint past ghost people.  I imagine that would come in handy when descending the tower.  Once I got back to the Villa, I just made a mad dash to the casino.  Ghost people are pretty slow, so I suppose you could just run past some of them."
ManyATrueNerd,36aiwc,NoOneImportant4,3,Sun May 17 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much the plan - a slow methodical approach to the Tower, then mines, GRX and running back..."

ManyATrueNerd,364oo2,Steven__hawking,7,Sat May 16 02:47:47 2015 UTC,"My bet of ""Legion Assassins"" seems so silly at this point. He never encountered a single one.  I'm not worried about ghost people or even deathclaws at this point, but the the collar-exploding radios are sudden death (I specifically remember them being impossible in the scaffolding area). Tunnelers are not only super fast, but the biggest threat is the Hulking Tunnelers. If they land a hit on Jon, he will ragdoll, while all the other enemies beat him mercilessly.  I would be very surprised to watch him die in any way other than those two. A distant third would be accidental fall damage while crossing the Divide."
ManyATrueNerd,364oo2,mikeburnfire,10,Sat May 16 07:58:35 2015 UTC,"I think no Legion assassis ever spawned, because I went out of my way to get +4 Legion reputation, so while Legion will shoot on sight, they're not hunting me..."

ManyATrueNerd,364oo2,ZeroKarasu,3,Sat May 16 05:54:09 2015 UTC,If he's got the flare gun and flash bangs - both provided either in the area or around it - there's a good chance he'll make it out relatively unscathed.
ManyATrueNerd,364oo2,DBrody6,2,Sat May 16 06:25:14 2015 UTC,I have to wonder if going into the elevator with a Stealth Boy active and just praying nothing notices you is a valid strategy. Flare Gun backup incase things go to shit.
ManyATrueNerd,364oo2,hordesoflegion,3,Sun May 17 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"If he makes it that far, I think the elevator in LR is a very likely place for him to die. Those tunnelers aren't very easy to take down in the first place, but that elevator ambush is going to be very hard for Jon. If he makes it through that crap, he deserves the world on a string."
ManyATrueNerd,364oo2,tansit,2,Sun May 17 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"If Jon makes it though dead money, then there are a LOT of things in the final DLC that could kill him. He's definitely going in order of least to most dangerous."

It makes New Vegas a lot more like FO3, except worse because there are no safe spots like Megaton or Rivet City. All the ammo you find is junk (therefore doesn't work at long-range, so no sniping). There are seldom few people to talk to, except for a few non-hostile traders.  I started near the Grub-and-Gulp. Everybody was hostile. I decided to go to backwards towards Goodsprings. At the 188 there was a terrifying new Heavy-NCR enemy who chased me away with an incinerator. Hostiles everywhere. Some of them are wearing masks made from human skin (WTF!). Novac was overrun by cannibals. Nipton was crawling with vicious tribals. The NCR outpost was not friendly. While traveling at night there are Abominations literally crawling out of the ground, ambushing me. I'm currently stuck in Primm. Hostiles everywhere, of course.  I'll play more later, but this is seriously no joke. It's fucking tough. The only reason I'm alive right now is because I gave myself a fuckton of ammo and armor through console commands. I might come back and play it again properly, but fuck. I'm playing on Easy difficulty and cheating and it's still kicking my ass."

(it's not without its flaws as a premise, since Sawyer's mod is clearly intended to be played in Hardcore Mode, but I'm sure creative use of the True Health Counter could work for that.)"
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,RealFoxD,9,Thu May 14 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a game/conversion mod that completely misses the point not just of New Vegas, but of the entire Fallout series, at least the parts of the series that were written by grown-ups (namely the first two games plus New Vegas, done by Black Isle/Obsidian/that team.)  Fallout isn't about the apocalypse or the devastation.  It's about humanity finding the best of itself (hell, even Fallout 3 clumsily stumbles toward this theme at the end.)  Sure, the tagline is ""war never changes"", but it's more Jurassic Park in its execution: ""Life finds a way.""  DUST makes me think, at least from the description, of something more like Metro 2033 or STALKER: Call of Pripyat rather than Fallout.  I mean, I get it (reading the mod's description on the Nexus page, the author took both Ulysses and Elijah at their word in Lonesome Road and Dead Money, respectively, about the Tunnelers and the Cloud), but if you found the atmosphere of New Vegas ""disappointing"" (as the mod author says he did), you're playing the wrong game."
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,mikeburnfire,6,Thu May 14 01:01:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it. This mod basically makes New Vegas more like FO3, and it's subjective as to whether or not that's a good thing.  I can understand why somebody could be disappointed with the atmosphere of New Vegas if they were expecting a similar sequel to FO3. They aren't the same-- one's post-apocalyptic, and the other is post-post-apocalyptic. One is inherently more dangerous than the other, and if someone prefers combat and survival mechanics to quests and lore then they will likely enjoy this mod.   It might not be ""Fallout"", but that doesn't make it bad, either."
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,RealFoxD,5,Thu May 14 04:11:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, certainly, I don't think a mod (assuming it's well-made, and all indications are that this one is) is without redeeming value just because it can be seen as twisting the lore into something far removed from the developers' vision for the universe---after all, the devs created these things (Tunnelers, the Cloud, the lore behind how the world in the Mojave is a lot more precarious than anyone presently there apart from the Courier seems to realise) in the first place.  This isn't something like Nehrim, which takes an existing game (Oblivion) and uses it to create something completely different (and, incidentally, awesome).  This is Fallout: Worst Case Scenario, but it's definitely, recognizably, alt-historical Fallout.  For someone like me though, who loves New Vegas (my favourite game of all time, in fact) but who found Fallout 3 to be a typical Bethesda ""great gameplay, gods-awful writing and characterisation"" type of game, and who flat-out didn't like Metro 2033 or Call of Pripyat for a lot of the same reasons that are selling points for this mod, it's not something I want to play.  And, since the context of all this is a forum about a cool guy who's really good at Fallout and who makes videos about the subject, my comment's out there to say ""hey, wait a minute, think long and hard about whether this is really a good idea for the channel, because this mod isn't what a lot of people love about New Vegas."""
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,mikeburnfire,1 point,Thu May 14 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"I respect (and agree with) your opinion.  I have a very difficult time playing Fallout 3, and as such I don't play it nearly as often. However, I think I would enjoy watching Jon play this mod. One needs to be VERY methodical to play it-- to have a strategy before assaulting an area, or to have the foresight to realize that avoiding a certain area is more practical."
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,RealFoxD,2,Thu May 14 11:37:36 2015 UTC,"I respect your capacity for civil discourse---it's refreshing on the Internet.  As for needing to be methodical to play a mod, that's one thing that I wish games in general would do more of, and one thing I give serious props to the New Vegas developers for attempting in the first place with Hardcore Mode, which was born out of all those ""realistic needs"" mods in Oblivion and Fallout 3.  Then again, it's harder for the actual dev team to do it because it costs time and money to build and debug a game mode that would probably only appeal to a small section of the audience, and that small section is usually savvy enough to either find a mod to do it or build that mod themselves (or, if we're all truly blessed by the gods, the lead designer will do it himself on his own time for his own enjoyment and then share it with the world.  Josh Sawyer is a god among men.)"
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,Ilitarist,1 point,Thu May 14 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Who says mods have to follow original vision?  Fallout is about people keeping getting back to old ideas. Even Fallout 3 translates this idea well - mostly thanks to huge budget, but still. World hostility is still important, at least to highlight that the real problem are other people and ideas (Supermutants are people transformed by military science, Enclave are people transformed by military ideology). The very same idea, by the way, is very important in Metro and STALKER.  I too was disappointed when I've started playing FNV cause it felt much more civilized than Fallout 1, 3 and even 2. But then it grew on me and I've embraced its different ideas (still they don't really work with hardcore mod which would much more suite Fallout 1 or 3). I sometimes return to Fallout 3 to see its uninhabited hostile wasteland. I would love to play this mod in FNV to see a new take on a story when civilization has fallen again.  And come on, this authors disappointment with FNV sounds exactly like your snobbish disappointment with F3."
ManyATrueNerd,35vp9q,RealFoxD,2,Thu May 14 13:24:53 2015 UTC,"I'll cop to snobbish disappointment with F3...I tend to agree with most of the arguments that No Mutants Allowed made against it, but overall I'm kinder to the game than they are because the gameplay's a helluva lot of fun even though the world-building, use of the lore, and writing for the NPCs all border on completely ridiculous.  You can mod in better guns, better monsters, better environments, but you can't fix Stupid in a game's main story and sidequests."

ManyATrueNerd,35vvgd,ZebraShark,2,Wed May 13 23:36:24 2015 UTC,Definitely light step. I ended up getting it halfway through my Dead Money playthrough as I almost killed myself getting to Dean.

ManyATrueNerd,35vvgd,acksed,3,Thu May 14 09:07:31 2015 UTC,"Like most good survival games, the key is to move quietly, watch for traps, and make every shot count.  Best character build for it is the sneaky sniper sort (high sneak, Silent Running, Light Step, as has already been stated here in two other posts.)  Find a place to completely survey every scene you go into---high Perception helps for picking up enemies on your compass marker---and mentally draw up a plan of attack.  See where the holograms are, where the Ghost People are, where the radios are.  ""Cheat"" if you have to by using the wiki to know which radios can be dealt with by wise use of guns and which ones will require frag grenades, so you don't run out of frags whilst going to Dean Domino backstage (this happened to me in my first playthrough and I must've died a dozen times on the last two radios trying to disable them.)  Then execute a plan of attack to take care of everything that needs taking care of.  It's a series of set pieces---imagine a soccer game that's nothing but free kicks.  If in Normal Mode, stock up like crazy on ammo every chance you get---if you're on Hardcore Mode you're going to have other problems to deal with, but you can still carry a decent amount of bullets, so do it."

He also has his Father And Sondays series with his dad. I could see him expanding either of these to be four player+ games, with guest players each week. The issue of course would be scheduling a time that everyone can play. Still, I could definitely see Jon being a recurring guest on something like that, especially if they stick with the GTA challenge maps a la Little And Cubed."

ManyATrueNerd,35ier5,NoOneImportant4,23,Tue May 12 08:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that trade you did Jon.  Not worth it.  Not worth it at all.    However, I have good news!  First among the good news:  There is a Pugilism Illustrated literally right behind the Vera hologram/fountain where you start, just laying on the ground.  Free skill points are free skill points.  Secondly:  When you go to get Dog/God, there is a vending machine holotape for the .308 ammo for the Automatic Rifle, which really eats through the ammo, so being able to buy more of it is a boon.  Third, if I'm not mistaken, and I don't think I am since I've played through Dead Money twice in the past couple weeks (and about to start a third run), there are only two absolutely mandatory spots where you -have- to go through thick cloud, but both of these instances can have their damage reduced to nothing if you have Dean with you (or if you want Implant GRX, not necessary though).  And, after you go through these two mandatory clouds, you can vent them away.  The two in question are:  There are thick clouds on the way to where you escort Dog/God to the switches, and the computer to vent the cloud is right next to the gate, and when you're taking Christine to the computer she has to use, there is thick cloud outside the building that can be vented by one of the computers inside the building (there is also a section inside where you have to cross a room with thick cloud at the bottom of a staircase, but once you go down the staircase you will see a brown pipe you can jump to that connects both sides of the room that allows you to almost completely avoid the cloud at the bottom of the stairs altogether).  And I can't remember the fourth good news I wanted to say...oh well.  As an aside:  You can use skill checks on Dean Domino, there is only one that you have to avoid, and I believe it is a 30 Speech check that says something along the lines of ""you think you're speaking from a position of power.""  That is the one you have to avoid.  The Explosives check just makes Dead impressed with your blue collar knowledge while the 25 Speech check makes him thank you for the reverence you're showing him.    If I remember the fourth piece of good news I wanted to share, I'll post it."

ManyATrueNerd,35ier5,NoOneImportant4,8,Sun May 10 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're heading back to the police station anyway, so no harm no foul.  Don't forget to pick up the Med-X holotape when you get Christine either.  Even if you don't lug Dean around everywhere, Med-X will still reduce a 20 damage cloud to 15 damage.    If you're gonna be using explosives, are you going to employ the Demolitions Charge?  There's a couple of holotapes for that around, and you could get tons of them with chips."
ManyATrueNerd,35ier5,LoneGuardian,4,Sun May 10 20:51:18 2015 UTC,"Huh, are you certain med-x impacts Cloud? I always thought that was hardcoded, given DR from rebreather doesn't effect it, so why would med-x...?"
ManyATrueNerd,35ier5,RealFoxD,3,Sun May 10 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I specifically tested it in my last play through.  I ran through a section of cloud, took something like 60 damage, then I hit a Med-X and ran through it again and it dropped to only 45 damage or so."

ManyATrueNerd,35ier5,TheProudBrit,4,Sun May 10 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"For clarification, it's not just the ghost people.  Any (humanoid) body you stand on top of and brutalize will explode and cause the shield icon to show up.

They pop up every time a ghost person's HP reaches 0, even if they are actually dead due to dismemberment. The best way to know is to check your XP counter when you take one down. An example of this glitch is the message that pops up when you kill the second-to-last ghost person in this episode. You can see that its leg came off (dead), and the message popped up anyway. Should save you some time later on!  Edit: Aaand it looks like a bunch of other people pointed this out in the YouTube comments.

ManyATrueNerd,35ier5,BLJohnFreeman,5,Mon May 11 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"Fun fact about New Vegas where regards the Dean's Electronics book in the bunker before the radio:  In the vanilla basegame, if you don't have the Dead Money DLC, the book is permanently locked in the bunker (the sewer grate is only accessible with the DLC installed.)  This makes it, in an un-enhanced game, the only skill book for which only 3 copies exist in the Mojave.  All other books have 4 (for a total of 12/16 skill points depending on Comprehension) copies, except Big Book of Science, which has a fifth copy available if you send the power to everyone and talk to Ignacio in Helios One as part of ""That Lucky Old Sun"".  Which brings up another point---there are 13 total skills that have associated books, and Comprehension grants effectively 53 skill points for free.  That's over three levels at Intelligence 10 (53/15=3.53 levels, or 53/17=3.12 levels with Educated) or as many as 53/12=4.42 levels if you play as an INT 4 character (the minimum for the perk)."

That means the Sierra Madre can actually be fairly close by, as it's in the desert. In a world with raiders and a shortage of purified water, would you just go wandering into the Desert?  The Divide can be extremely close by (and Johnson Nash mentions it in passing), as nobody goes there purely because it's a death trap. Big MT can be close too - anybody who goes there doesn't come back, and it's well defended and full of monsters. Nobody would WANT to go there.  Honest Hearts, meanwhile, we know the exact location, thanks to references to real cities and states nearby, which makes sense, because it's a trading spot."

Apart from being a major element of the ballistic defense matrix, Hopeville was also the subject of a major Big MT research project concerning meteorology; a project that apparently ended in a disaster, spawning the dust storms the Divide is infamous for.  Besides the project, Big MT was also a partner in different enterprises: at one point, the entire local hippie commune that protested outside Hopeville against the ongoing Sino-American War were rounded up by special riot control officers, wearing a new model of L.A.P.D. riot armor, and shipped them off to Big MT as test subjects. The whole incident was regulated by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment who notably wore a recognizable helmet and a more advanced riot armor.

As for Big MT?  Another total WAG, but there's a mountain in the Nopah Range Wilderness Area that looks like it could've been a candidate to have a science base dug into it (and the top blown off of it), and it's practically due west of Red Rock Canyon and just over the state line.  As for where the Lonesome Road might end up, ""Hopeville"" and ""Ashton"" might be between Barstow (debatably the site of Vault 12/Necropolis---canonically Vault 12 is in Bakersfield but on the map in Fallout 1, it's where Barstow's supposed to be) and Vegas itself.  The ""Long 15"" is the only way to get to Vegas from there, and the DLC talks in depth about NCR supply lines, specifically the Legion's efforts to cut them.  Honest Hearts, of course, is a subject of no controversy---Zion National Park is a real-world location (and recreated in remarkably accurate detail in-game; Josh Sawyer is on record as saying it's one of his favourite vacation spots.)"

Receiver is a low polygon FPS that features randomly generated levels and permadeath. There are robotic turrets and hovering drones that will try to take you out. The big feature of the game is the realistic guns. Rather than just pressing a button to reload, you have to perform every action for loading bullets, inserting the clip, loading the chamber, etc. There is a revolver and two semi-auto pistols. It's very difficult as you die in one hit, have limited ammo, and must hit specific parts of the robots to disable them. Your goal is to find 8 cassette tapes that are strewn throughout the buildings. They offer some plot, but there's not much to it. It's really about trying to survive.

Rules (note that I had to mess with the formatting pretty hard here, so mind the awful look:   No selling anything to any merchant ever for any reason.  A friend of mine on Facebook and I had a helluva discussion about whether NCR and Legion money---being even-up tradable for caps with most merchants and at all casinos---counted.  I said ""yes, but nobody's going to hold it against you if you think otherwise."" (1) No buying anything from any merchant ever, with the following exceptions: (2) Weapon mods (note that you're not going to be using Gun Runners Arsenal here), since they're obtainable by no other means (2A), and Implants from Dr. Usanagi (for the same reason.)  That said, good luck raising tens of thousands of caps without selling anything. (2B) NO GAMBLING.  Full stop. (3) Money may thus be earned by the following means: (4) Looted off enemies.  The whole point of this is that you find what you want and need out in the wastes and not in the towns.  You're role-playing an opportunist who can't or won't deal with civilisation any more than strictly necessary. (4A) Found in boxes/crates/lying about on the floor. Or ""found"" in someone's house---the Courier ain't too proud to steal, although you can certainly make a challenge rule that he's somehow moral or religious or something. (4B) Earned as quest rewards.  You do a job for someone, you deserve to be paid for your time.  Your Courier is not a slave. (4C) But not unmarked quests that are basically selling by another name (meaning no trading in snowglobes/dogtags/ears/other collectibles for caps.) (4D) You want more ammo, loot it or craft it.  Treat the good stuff like gold and save it for a special occasion, because until and unless you trigger hit squads for their sweet, delicious high-level gear (unless...see #6), you're not getting 12.7mm or 45-70 Gov't much.  Hand Loader and Jury Rigging are essential perks here. (5) If you want a little extra challenge, side with the Legion, but get the NCR on side first so they don't spawn hit squads.  Goodbye, flat-out exploit (and remember rule 4D, because Caesar's Favor counts under that rule.) (6) Do this in Hardcore Mode, because balancing crafting supplies, weighted ammo, and your weapon loadout is part of the challenge.  This is where the Pack Rat, Strong Back, and Burden to Bear perks come in handy. (7) If you're on PC, and if you hate yourself, do this with JSawyer.esp installed. (8) Permadeath.  Because permadeath, always.  Especially with #8. (9)"

ManyATrueNerd,34qsfd,chalkman,2,Mon May 4 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic, but having just completed a hardcore run myself. Thirst is largely what makes HC runs really tedious and annoying. It's not really difficult to scavenge, as it just means a lot of stop offs at Goodsprings Source/NCR Ranger Safehouse/Camp Golf for fresh water. The same could be said of food and sleep but those aren't so incessant that you need to add an extra stop on every fast travel run across the map."
ManyATrueNerd,34qsfd,RealFoxD,3,Mon May 4 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'll offer the counterpoint, since I always, without exception, play on Hardcore Mode.  It opens up a lot of interesting challenges, and not all of them are nearly as insane as Jon's effort here (my hat is off to him, since I'm an atrocious speedrunner as well---squirrel-sized attention span and all.)  Plus, there are plenty of mods out there on the PC that accelerate the food/sleep/thirst decay and make it a lot more necessary to scavenge/plan routes (JSawyer.esp is the gold standard, but the Nexus is chock-full of such things.)  Jon's on 360 (as are many Fallout players), but the PC Gaming Master Race has a lot to love about Hardcore Mode.  Plus, ""ammo has weight"" makes it feel a lot less cheaty.  You can't just carry a million 12.7mm and .50 MG rounds everywhere, which also means the Anti-Materiel Rifle becomes a much more tactical (read: Deathclaw) weapon.  Can't really effectively fight Deathclaws (on a Guns build at least) without it, but it weighs 13 pounds with the CF Parts mod and the bullets are four to the pound (or eight to the pound with Pack Rat, which becomes a much more important perk in HC.)"
ManyATrueNerd,34qsfd,FinalFate,2,Mon May 4 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that the developers realised how onerous dehydration was, which is why they then added the Vault 13 canteen in the Courier's Stash DLC.

ManyATrueNerd,34qkn2,ManyATrueNerd,5,Sun May 3 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're not starting Dead Money until next week, Jon?  Well that's good.  My latest run through Dead Money has taught me a number of things.  I don't think Implant GRX is as necessary as I originally thought, if you're willing to lug Dean Domino around with you until you can vent out all of the thick cloud you'll have to go through.  There's only two places where you need to vent, and after that you will have virtually 0 places where you have to expose yourself to the thick cloud (there is about half a second during Christine's quest, but it's only ten damage)."
ManyATrueNerd,34qkn2,NoOneImportant4,4,Sun May 3 19:08:08 2015 UTC,Is there around that damn cloud on the way back from the Tower when you activate the Gala? I've never found a way to avoid that one...
ManyATrueNerd,34qkn2,ManyATrueNerd,7,Sun May 3 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't have to go through that.  I think there are three paths to reach the tower, and two of them intersect.  Once you come down from the tower, there should be the straight path with the cloud and two ghost people walking up.  You can just ignore that.  There should also be a path to the left and a path to the right.  The whole area is a big circle and it's easy to get lost in it.  I should be back in Dead Money before the week is over for a third run through, this time I'll be trying to go 0 HP loss again and I can map out a clear path to take.  I found a stealth boy on my way up to the tower as well, and I'm not sure if it's a 100% spawning stealth boy or not, but if it is, I would highly recommend using it to escape the tower.  It's possible to come down fighting all the ghost people, but it's really, really tedious."
ManyATrueNerd,34qkn2,NoOneImportant4,5,Sun May 3 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, stealth boys are a 1% draw from Dean's stashes. I'm hoping to get lucky for the return from the Tower..."

ManyATrueNerd,34jnkl,Bookworm12k,1 point,Sat May 2 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of reasons to hate on Ubisoft besides just uPlay. They rehash their games more than COD, so much that some of the rehashing bleeds to other series. The towers from AC first leaked into FC3 and FC4, and apparently will be also somehow featured in the Crew, a driving game. They are a dishonest company, they purposefully gimped the release of Watch_dogs, i think it may have even worked better after some of the stuff that was basically just turned off was restored. AC Unity was a mess...  Simply put, there's plenty more reason to hate Ubisoft than just uPlay, and most if not all of this stuff extends to consoles as well. Ubisoft is actively digging themselves into a deeper and deeper pit..."
ManyATrueNerd,34jnkl,Platinum_rain,1 point,Mon May 4 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Seriously, some great games there, though not the most spectacular prices."
ManyATrueNerd,34jnkl,ManyATrueNerd,2,Fri May 1 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"Dunno, if you don't have some of the earlier Assassin's Creeds then you can get them for like £3 each."
ManyATrueNerd,34jnkl,Cowgus,1 point,Fri May 1 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"Even though i'm a proud member of PCMR i would say there are two options that won't make your life a living hell dealing with uPlay. Either you buy the games for consoles, or you buy them on PC and then pirate them to get a fully working product that's not gimped by uPlay.  I normally don't endorse piracy, but paying for something, and if it doesn't work (as intended) or you if you can get otherwise better version of the game by pirating it, if you paid for it i say pirate away."
ManyATrueNerd,34jnkl,Holyrapid,1 point,Sun May 3 06:21:43 2015 UTC,"what does uPlay actually do, and why is it disliked? I've never really used it before, other than buying FNV through it and getting a Steam key"
ManyATrueNerd,34jnkl,Maschinengewehr,1 point,Sun May 3 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"It's the most intrusive form of DRM ever, it's unnecessary most of the time as most of the games are bought from Steam but have to launch trough both, i'm not sure if anything ever goes on sale trough it and you can only buy Ubisoft games via it from what i remember.  Also, it's usability is pretty bad. Just by a quick search on reddit, i found that someone was unable to redeem game codes that came with their graphics card, someone else was unable to launch their game, bunch of it has to do with Ubisoft just being bad and faking things. Remember the Watch_Dogs drama about how the game didn't look nearly as good as they showed at first, then someone discovered the files to make it look more like it was originally shown, were there from the start...  Ubisoft and uPlay suck donkey cock if you ask me. If you want to own Ubisoft titles and actually play them easily; buy the games never install them via uplay and instead get them via torrenting."

ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,Aduckonquack97,22,Sun Apr 26 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of things we need to keep in mind:  First and foremost, if Jon dies, it'll be in a DLC. Secondly, he has promised that, if he dies, he'll throw himself off the Primm rollercoaster.  With these two things in mind, if the true health counter hits 0 in Dead Money (and I feel certain it will), Jon won't be able to make good on his promise immediately.  It also wouldn't be all that entertaining to just stop mid-DLC.  I feel certain that, should the THC hit 0, Jon will continue through the rest of Dead Money, playing under the same rules and keeping track of how far into the negatives he goes until he finishes it, then he'll throw himself off the rollercoaster.    Of course, if he dies in Lonesome Road then he can just fast travel out.  But I think Lonesome Road is the only DLC in which you can come and go freely, none of the rest of the DLC gives you that option."
ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,NoOneImportant4,10,Sun Apr 26 23:52:28 2015 UTC,"Jon will almost certainly have a save in the Mojave to throw himself off the roller coaster. I feel like going into the negative is against the spirit of the THC, and removes the pressure. It would be nice to see Jon finish all the DLC, but the risk of the run was always that he had the potential of not being able to finish it. It's remarkable that he's gotten as far as he has."
ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,Bookworm12k,2,Mon Apr 27 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you understand.  In all areas of the game except the first three DLC, the option to leave and go jump off the rollercoaster was there.  That option will not be present in Dead Money (not counting HH or OWB since they're done now).  And I think it would make for worse viewing if Jon reverts to a pre-save before he begins Dead Money.  But that last part is just my opinion."
ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,NoOneImportant4,11,Mon Apr 27 00:41:34 2015 UTC,I understand just fine. Reverting to a pre-DM save is what I meant.
ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,Bookworm12k,4,Mon Apr 27 00:47:58 2015 UTC,He should throw himself off the rollercoaster one time for every point under 1 he is.
ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,alexxerth,2,Mon Apr 27 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, he's only supposed to jump off the roller coaster if the true health counter reaches zero, not the normal one. I feel like if he dies in Dead Money, it will be an instant death from the collar."
ManyATrueNerd,33yzn1,FinalFate,2,Mon Apr 27 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"I feel certain that, should the THC hit 0, Jon will continue through the rest of Dead Money, playing under the same rules and keeping track of how far into the negatives he goes until he finishes it, then he'll throw himself off the rollercoaster.

I don't know if you translated it yourself through google translater or someone else did it for you, but this is hardly what I'd call anti-gaming, or going against your LP.

ManyATrueNerd,33wnqf,ManyATrueNerd,6,Sun Apr 26 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"""Rollenspieler-Spinner"" can be translated best as: roleplaying crazy guy (nutter, weirdo etc.), and the sentence below that says: ""This Fallout-killer kills everyone"". It sounds better in german. It's a loud clickbait title, but not really malicious. Never heard someone use the word: ""Spinner"" as crackpot though.  Since I have nothing better to do, here's the rest of the article, you can be the judge wether it's hostile towards you:  ""Usually with roleplaying games like Fallout you get the most out of building alliances and being diplomatic, but this player has a different goal in mind.  If you want to survive in the Fallout series you should take out hostile enemies, but usually it's about clearing the anarchy of the wasteland, and of course, to survive doing so.  The game is already pretty old, coming out in 2009. The scenario: (scenario of Fallout 3 explained).  However, the game provides a lot of freedom for the player. Reason enough for Manyatruenred to play the game in a completely different way.  Manyatruenerd started on the 19th of january of this year with their mission: ""Kill everything"" in Fallout 3. Not only friend or foe would be killed in this challenge, but all 3012 virtual living creatures the wasteland houses. With that, Manyatruenerd created a character to accomplish this task.  However, the hardest targets weren't the toughest in this case. Usually the side-characters offered the biggest challenge. For example, a trader called ""Schranpel"" is hard to even lay a scratch on. Apparently a bug in the game causes him to walk through the desert and attack everyone, but never seems to be able to die. Even so, they did eventually managed to kill this tough cookie. How they did it, the bastards wouldn't reveal to us.  On August 31st the deed was finished. The world of Fallout 3 was conquered. The seven month(!) killer-orgy was documented on his youtube channel.  The question that remains: Is this still funny, or just sadistic/schadenfreude?""  Forgive the wonky translation in some parts, some sentences don't cross over very well from german to english. :)"

It's too nihilistic for my blood.  But when I do it in Fallout 3, it feels right.  This is a damning condemnation of Bethesda's writers on some level, I think...they can't create characters that I can be arsed to care about enough to feel bad murdering them."

ManyATrueNerd,33wnqf,abraxo_cleaner,5,Sun Apr 26 11:45:35 2015 UTC,"""Going independent"" isn't quite the same thing as ""Kill Everything""...the only mandatory kill in an independent run is Mr. House.  You don't technically have to destroy (or even say more than five words to) the Brotherhood of Steel (although Yes Man sure does want you to), and the same is true of every other faction in the game.  I have certain folks I keep alive in every game---a short but by no means complete list of ""you guys get to live"" in 99% of my playthroughs:   Goodsprings The people of Primm, who get the robot as their sheriff The people of Novac, including completing Come Fly With Me the good-guy ""put the ghouls closer to the target"" route so they get the best ending North Vegas, Westside, and any other ""good"" group that has no use for the NCR in Outer Vegas The Followers of the Apocalypse (including playing nice with Ignacio in That Lucky Old Sun) The Boomers (I can't help but love a bunch of folks who use artillery as a Sorting Hat) The Super Mutants at Jacobstown (including finding a cure for the Nightkin) Every companion except Veronica (who gets used as a bullet sponge after I activate my turret friends---more on this in a second) The Kings except Pacer (who gets a dose of Psycho in his Jet) The Great Khans   And on the other hand, my list of Oprah's ""You get a bullet in the face!  YOU get a bullet in the face!  EVERYONE GETS A BULLET IN THE FACE!"" guys, who are guaranteed to die in every single run I play:   If blessed with a Varmint Rifle Silencer in Chet's inventory in Goodsprings, Vulpes Inculta gets killed by a 5.56mm AP round (with high enough Guns---about 70 or so in my experience---you can do this with a headshot without turning the Legion hostile.)  Vulpes otherwise lives because there's no other opportune time to kill him without turning the Legion hostile. Any unnamed member of Caesar's Legion I can kill without annoying the faction unnecessarily (I leave Caesar's elite alive now that I know you'll get hit squads if you kill them---Legion used to be Kill Everything) Everyone else in Caesar's Legion except Cursor Lucullus at Cottonwood Cove once I've traded in enough dog tags to get to Liked.  Do this with a silenced weapon and you don't lose reputation with the Legion. Any unnamed NCR character out in the field (I'm generally friendly to the Republic but I'll happily farm dog tags to keep the Legion off my ass in the lategame) Alice McLafferty, once I've completed the Crimson Caravan's quests Gloria Van Graaf (plus everyone else who's in the Silver Rush when I let the suicide bomber in---note that these previous two kills make Rose of Sharon Cassidy a whole lot more fun to have around) Any evil faction where there's a choice whether or not to kill them (meaning the Powder Gangers both at NCRCF and in Vault 19, plus the Fiends in Vault 3), they die. Mortimer of the White Glove Society (the rest of them get to live) Nero and Big Sal, plus Clanden because fuck that guy. Jeanie May Crawford, courtesy of Boone's rifle. Captain Curtis/Frumentarius Picus, as part of ""I Put A Spell On You"" The Brotherhood of Steel, with a little help from my (turret) friends.  Veronica is used as a bullet sponge when she's still technically on my side (after activating the turrets, before activating the self-destruct, the base is hostile but the reputation is still Neutral---she usually gets killed before the self-destruct triggers her leaving the Courier due to Vilified).  If she somehow survives that, I let the exploding bunker do her in. The Enclave Remnants, because dear old friends, I remember Navarro, because I played Fallout 2, and fuck those guys."
ManyATrueNerd,33wnqf,RealFoxD,3,Sun Apr 26 15:09:52 2015 UTC,"You're quite right that being independent doesn't mean you have to butcher everyone, but slaughtering everyone does pretty much mean going independent. I do have a bit of a soft spot for House because he's so smarmy, so sometimes he gets to live. But of all the NV NPCs you listed, the only ones I really find compelling and interesting and rarely kill are the REPCONN ghouls and some of the Kings.  I do approve of your kill list, though I tend to favor energy weapons so the Van Graffs get to live. It's almost worth it for Cass' quest where the objective ""Make that bitch eat her hair"" comes up, but doing that means not using any weapons that eat Electron Charge Packs for the rest of the game.  Bonus points for murdering every single person you come across but also being idolized by every single faction (or liked, in cases where idolized is impossible)."

Eden's little FEV thing was not an original idea in Fallout 3, and it was much better-executed by the earlier game.  Play through Fallout 2 and you REALLY learn to hate the Enclave and everything associated with it.  The Remnants were part of that.  Like hunting down Nazi war criminals decades after their crimes...they had to die.  Well, I DO send the Khans clear out of the Mojave in the ending (choosing the ""forge your own destiny!"" approach that ends with the Khans in Wyoming after the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.)  Plus, the Fiends aren't really a threat minus Motor-Runner, Cook-Cook, Violet, and Driver Nephi (again, per the ending cutscene.)"
ManyATrueNerd,33wnqf,RealFoxD,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"I know the plotline of Fallout 2 and how bad the Enclave were, but I do not consider it rational to judge five people for the actions of a thousand. Especially when Johnson and Kreger are really nice guys and Whitman and Henry were never dedicated fascists. Furthermore, using ex-fascists (Enclave) to help stop current fascists (Legion) seems like a good idea.  Yeah, but imagine the pain that their ""Mighty Empire"" becomes in NCR's ass. That would weaken relations with the NCR for decades on end. Plus, if they're willing to enable the Fiends and help Benny, imagine what they'll be willing to do to everyone in Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, and Idaho. They're cool for raiders, but that doesn't say much."
ManyATrueNerd,33wnqf,Francois_Rapiste,2,Wed Apr 29 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"The Khans posing an issue (and the Legion never really going away, just being chased off) to the NCR works to my benefit---""divide et impera"", as Caesar would say.  I'm up there in the Lucky 38 with Yes Man getting the job of ruling a new nation-state done.  The Khans are even natural allies since they like me just fine.  If it makes everything a bit more...challenging...for the NCR, I'm in favour.  As to the Enclave remnants, you raise an interesting moral question (Black Isle/Obsidian-made Fallout games are great for that, aren't they?).  I choose to view them as Nazis, (to steal another Caesar phrase) ""damnatio memoriae"", even those who were ""only following orders"", while you've chosen to view them as rehabilitated from a troubled past.  Interesting moral viewpoint."
ManyATrueNerd,33wnqf,RealFoxD,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"I suppose it'd give them another reason not to get cocky, but my points are still valid about deteriorating relations with them. Plus you might have to act as a mediator between the two from time to time. Blech.  They are great for that! Yeah, I try to live in the here and now. Moreno is still a Nazi asshole, but the others don't seem to be that anymore. I simply don't believe that ""once a Nazi, always a Nazi"" applies in the other cases due to the fact that the other four aren't likely to do anything Nazi-ish anytime soon. Unless you get them to fight for Legion, I guess."

ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,xiMbd03u1,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:34:50 2015 UTC,"The answers a spot complex, but my understanding is that I get paid for every ad that's shown (just a bit), more for a completed ad - but I never have and never will ask people to sit through ads, unless those ads actually interest you (like a film trailer)"

If there was a dollar amount that someone could pledge on Patreon, that would absolve them from watching the ads, what would that amount be? Because I loathe ads, but I have gotten so much entertainment from your content that I can't justify not compensating you somehow."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,xiMbd03u1,4,Fri Apr 24 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"Literally $1  Unless you particularly enjoy watching ads all the way through, and are more likely than normal to click on them, a single $1 per month through Patreon would be worth more than the ads.  That's the kind of mad thing about YouTube - if just 10% of people put in $1 per month, then I'd have enough to do YouTube at least part-time - maybe full-time. But under the current ad model, even part-time isn't workable."

ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,nboland1989,6,Thu Apr 23 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"This brings up a question I've always had/never totally understood about ad blocking, and white listing people.  So, say I've white listed MATN. Okay, the ads show up on the video or what have you.  However, I am never actively clicking on said links. Does my having the ads appear rather than be hidden actually effect anything? Does Jon still get any revenue without me actually clicking anything?  I'm not trying to talk people out of turning off their ad block. I'm legitimately curious."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,JustinDP,5,Thu Apr 23 14:07:26 2015 UTC,"Eli5: The way the add works is your browser essentially has to request the info for the add from their server to display it. They count the number of requests for the info and then pay the site owner for each one. Add block blocks the initial request, so you aren't counted, and thus no money for your page view is given."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,Da_Chief99,4,Thu Apr 23 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, so the clicking on the ad, or lack thereof, is irrelevant. I see now, thank you."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,JustinDP,2,Thu Apr 23 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"Actually the payments to youtube partners are based on advertisements clicked. It actually has to be clicked on and redirected to the site/product/whatever that is being advertised otherwise no one gets paid.   There are plenty of videos put up by youtubers that explain the process, but it is simply $$$ for clicked ads."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,hskrnut,2,Thu Apr 23 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"You are incorrect, youtube monetizes in 2 ways.  Either through a per click method like you described, or a through a per view method like I described.  The per view requires either 30 seconds of the add watched, or at least half before it counts as an ad view (whichever is shorter).  Clicks just make more money than views."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,Da_Chief99,2,Thu Apr 23 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"But skipping the ad 5 seconds in does not pay the channel. The way the previous comment said it was based on a server receiving requests, makes it sound like every time the page was refreshed it would count as a hit and add to the tally of ads that would be paid for.  Pre-rolls that are completely viewed will pay regardless because, like TV advertising, it has been absorbed by the viewer. But the side bar ads (if those are still a thing) require clicks to count."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,hskrnut,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"Side bar ads sometimes pay out by view, depends which company is serving then. Idk if YouTube uses them anyways.

ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,Da_Chief99,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"There's also the hilarious difference between video ads sold by dynamic auction, and the reserved inventory - which seem to pay and work slightly differently, but the view doesn't know which is which...

ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,kotor610,2,Thu Apr 23 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"Fairly sure it's the BetaFish Adblocker / 'Adblock' is the adblocker being referenced.  If you use Adblock Plus, there is a user script for whitelisting YouTube channels here."

ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,mattinthecrown,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that YouTube advertising just doesn't generate as much actual revenue for companies as they thought, and now they find themselves paying more and more and more small channels. It's just really not a sound advertising investment and frankly, I think is doomed to fail.   I watch MATN's ads, well I let them play, but I don't click, buy, or really even retain information about the ad I just watched 99.999999% of the time. So they're wasting money paying Jon for my ad views and that just hurts their profit margin.  We as a society, and especially on YouTube, are SATURATED with media and advertising. If I only watched 2 or 3 videos on YouTube a week, advertising there might have more of an effect on me, but it doesn't. And when I do recognize an ad, I'm usually annoyed. I realize that still helps their brand recognition, but I don't spend money anyway.  Instead of whitelisting him, I'd encourage people to support him on patreon."
ManyATrueNerd,33kt25,Martient712,3,Thu Apr 23 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue is that advertisers aren't being clever enough.

I have to say, though, the biggest issue with this video is the inevitable fact that there are a finite amount of them in the pipeline—a Dan/Jon co-op channel a la GameGrumps or Super Beard Bros. would possibly be the greatest channel to grace the planet."

ManyATrueNerd,33ih9b,Cowgus,11,Wed Apr 22 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"It was very surreal - because normally when I hear his voice, it's because I'm watching a video of his, so I'm not supposed to be commntating then. I think I was very quiet at first, but later in that part and in the later parts, I'm much more chatty."

ManyATrueNerd,33io02,dabisnit,3,Thu Apr 23 04:14:37 2015 UTC,I wonder how well this could be modded. All the people saying it was too short or repetitive - sounds like it'd be prime material for a fan-made expansion.

ManyATrueNerd,33io02,Stoyon,2,Thu Apr 23 08:42:15 2015 UTC,"I found this game to be very strange, I kinda liked the styling at first, but when I got more into it I found it to be way more style over substance, There was just too many design quirks and stuff that didn't make any sense other than to try and look cool. I also found the game REALLY short, it started ok, with the story being built up and you getting stronger. After a while I found it enjoyable, and then it stopped just as it felt as the main game was about to start. That was a huge let down. I now see that there is a €4.99 DLC on steam that somehow has been added to my steam account (I have no memory of buying it), though I don't want to download 22gb just to be able to run a €5 DLC..."
ManyATrueNerd,33io02,abraxo_cleaner,2,Thu Apr 23 08:40:04 2015 UTC,"Very minor spoilers, Jon- your survival pod was not the first one to open, a lot of the reason there are as many people and as much tech as there is is thanks to that. The game goes into it later on in the story.  I think your appraisal was fair. Rage was fun, but it wasn't a special game, and I had definitely hoped for more from the studio that brought us Doom and Quake."
ManyATrueNerd,33ftrv,Holyrapid,7,Wed Apr 22 04:16:53 2015 UTC,The only reason that someone doesn't have a TVTropes page is usually because the fans don't have the knowhow. Let's prove them otherwise.

I don't have the greatest memory and can't remember everything that could be a trope I have not (yet) seen every video Jon has made I don't have the time to go trough every video to seek tropes I don't have the time to edit everything in.   I have started the page, so if you want to help, head over here and make and account if you already don't and edit away.  Also, calling /u/ManyATrueNerd as you may want to make your own account, and add to the trope trove yourself, as you'd probably know your works better than anyone else."
ManyATrueNerd,33ftrv,ManyATrueNerd,4,Thu Apr 23 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think it would be wrong for me to be involved - surely people shouldn't be writing their own TV Tropes page, just like they shouldn't ever touch their own Wikipedia page..."

The ghost people's perception was not as bad as I remembered it being, so I was actually able to secure quite a few stealth kills.  That being said, you really should get your Energy Weapons maxed because the Holorifle is really your best friend in Dead Money, especially for a sneaky style like you're doing.  The Police Pistol is simply garbage and the Automatic Rifle isn't much better, and neither of them are very good for sneaky ranged kills.    As a personal achievement, I was finally able to find every single holographic emitter in Dead Money for the first time with that run.    So, if you do manage to survive Old World Blues, I have to recommend hitting up Lonesome Road before going to Dead Money for the sole reason of picking up some more perks.  Hand Loader makes better ammo for Dead Money which is a real tide turner, and I need to test if Implant GRX will help you get through the thick cloud while taking less damage.  I don't think you've taken Silent Running yet either, which you'll need so that the ghost people don't hear you walking around, ruining any chance at a stealth kill you could have."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,NoOneImportant4,2,Sun Apr 19 21:13:10 2015 UTC,"I did attempt a no healing Dead Money run, and although I failed...   What killed you? I assume it was one of those 1HKO detonators."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,petenu,1 point,Mon Apr 20 11:38:13 2015 UTC,"The thick cloud killed me.  There's a few parts where you have to walk through it, and each time I did I ended up taking between 30-60 HP worth of damage.  I'd say the thick cloud ended up taking a full 60% of my HP and the rest of the 40% was carelessness in combat on my part.  I already know where all the speakers are and they're simple to deal with, and now I know where all the holographic emitters are so I know how to deal with every hologram.  But I don't know a good way of dealing with the thick cloud.  I've started another game so I can test and see if Implant GRX allows you to zoom through the cloud and take less damage, but I'm not hopeful."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:35:42 2015 UTC,What was your strategy with the ghost people? Was it just sneak attack criticals with the holorifle?
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,Squoghunter1492,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"For a bit I tried to take them out with the Police Pistol and hand loaded .357 ammo.  Hobbler perk with Concentrated Fire allowed for easy leg shots, but the damage was abysmal.  The Automatic Rifle didn't prove much better.  Eventually I settled on Max Charge Holorifle sneak shots as often as I could, as it usually just killed them straight out.  If I recall, it didn't one-shot the Bear Trap Fist guys though, but they're melee and slow, so you should have plenty of time to hit them one or two more times and kill them.    After they were dead, I'd go up to them and hack them apart with a melee weapon to make sure they were down, but...it seems that when a ghost person's limb explodes from dismemberment, you take some damage.  So, if you're going to dismember a downed ghost person:  Use the Police Pistol for it!  Or the 9mm, either or I suppose.  What I really wish is that I knew where all the secret, hidden items were in Dead Money.  There's stuff just hidden lying around everywhere.  The last time I played it I found a single shot shotgun just lying in a place that I never thought to check before.  Particularly, it'd be nice to have an early gun to use the 20 gauge rounds with."

ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,paleoreef103,10,Mon Apr 20 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"Ouch, Jon. I was biting my nails when you were sneaking past the robo-scorpions, but a simple cyberdog was your worst injury. Bad luck!"
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,NoOneImportant4,9,Sun Apr 19 21:06:59 2015 UTC,Is your goal to get to the very hard terminal in the X-42 facility to shut down the giant robo-scorpion?  I'm seriously impressed by how far you've made it by the way.  Just under half hit points and almost done with two DLCs and the end game is crazy!
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,DBrody6,6,Sun Apr 19 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"That's really Jon's only option.  Let's be real, there's no way actually fighting the scorpion is gonna be a choice.  That's just suicide.  I imagine Jon will either try to sneak to the shut down terminal or sneak to the protectrons to distract the scorpion, THEN sneak to the terminal."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,dabisnit,5,Sun Apr 19 21:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, fighting it head on is an option. Equip the Proton Inversal Axe, charge straight at it, and circle strafe it. Don't even need any points in melee, you kill it in 10-12 swings. I've fought the Giant Roboscorpion every playthrough of OWB that way, even the first one, and have never taken damage. It's a comically trivial fight."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,HongManChoi,2,Mon Apr 20 00:34:34 2015 UTC,I did that my first play through as well. The next time when I was better at Fallout I tried shooting it to death and took a ton of radiation. The time after that I did the shutdown.
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,DBrody6,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:30:19 2015 UTC,Isn't it highly radioactive though?  He'd take a lot of RADs if he did it that way.
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,TheGreatBritAnt,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"It creates a large radioactive zone after it self destructs, which takes several seconds after it dies. Pretty sure Mobius even taunts you about the impending explosion before it happens. So unless he just stands right next to the corpse (and I'd doubt that), it's a fairly sound tactic. It just sounds suicidal. Hell might even be worth popping a Stealth Boy for it."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,thirdtotheleft,4,Mon Apr 20 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"According to ManyATrueAnalytics, the previous minimum was 51.58%  (245/475) at the end of part 28 (Roboscorpion explosion splash damage), so this is indeed the first time PD Shoot has dropped below half health.  I wonder if you could have jumped on top of the desk before accessing the computer to put yourself in a better position with the dogs?"

ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,NoOneImportant4,4,Sun Apr 19 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"Jon, there's some energy weapon ammo in the trophy case in the lobby of the school test. The case that has the force field over it. I didn't see you grab it, so I'm not sure if you knew."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,MxDaleth,4,Sun Apr 19 22:19:20 2015 UTC,I suggest Jon increase melee weapons before doing Dead Money. Completely silent stealth kills with throwing spears is a life saver. I've cleared out Caesar's camp completely undetected using only spears before. And Knife Spears are plentiful in the DLC. Consider it.
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,NoOneImportant4,5,Sun Apr 19 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, that's a good idea. But I also want to get energy maxed for the holorifle..."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,Qwarr,2,Mon Apr 20 07:27:38 2015 UTC,"Given Jon's playstyle, I don't think melee weapons will be necessary for Dead Money.  Max Charge cells with the Holorifle are enough to one shot most of the ghost people.  Two shots at most, which is easy since they're so slow.  Honestly, combat is the easy part of Dead Money.  Dealing with the thick cloud is the real danger."
ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,Flashpoint_Rowsdower,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:27:26 2015 UTC,I second this. Ghosts are easy with sneak attack melee/unarmed.

ManyATrueNerd,335rsf,dabisnit,2,Mon Apr 20 13:02:23 2015 UTC,I didn't consciously do that - I just only show the Pip Boy if I've got something to say about it. The Pip Boy heath isn't accurate anyway - as I'm using the far more harsh true health counter.

ManyATrueNerd,335zf7,RedGinger666,9,Sun Apr 19 21:38:01 2015 UTC,The BMT can be used from any zone in the base game. So it can't transport you to or from Dead Money zones.
ManyATrueNerd,335zf7,nosaJay19,3,Sun Apr 19 21:45:50 2015 UTC,So I guess you just get the same error as if you tried to use it while in combat? I never actually tried that.
ManyATrueNerd,335zf7,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Apr 20 07:30:22 2015 UTC,"JE Sawyer himself said that because of the way FormIDs work in the game's engine, DLC content can't be engineered to work with other DLC content unless it's from the same DLC or else working with the basegame.  Similarly, content added by a PC mod tends to be squirrelly when you try to use it with a piece of content added by a different mod or even by the game's own DLC---this is why most mods assume that (a) you have Ultimate Edition and (b) you're putting the mods in your load order after all ""official"" content---otherwise no modded gun could fire .45 ACP ammo (because it's from Honest Hearts) without crashing the game in the process."

Now, consider that in True Detective, Rust is initially set up in-universe as the real suspect for the girls being murdered, when really he's just a douche trying to do the right thing on his own accord.

ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,iiRockpuppy,2,Sat Apr 18 18:34:05 2015 UTC,Guess it's time to start this series :P  Are you going to be revealing what game you're replacing for Saturdays now or next week?
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,iiRockpuppy,2,Sat Apr 18 19:59:55 2015 UTC,10 minutes or so :D
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,XmRyan,2,Sat Apr 18 20:51:35 2015 UTC,Yay!
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,SwarleyStinson-,2,Sat Apr 18 21:10:34 2015 UTC,"Excellent series thus far, John! I'd just like to chime in and say that I appreciate how consistent the quality of your videos has been. Wonderful job with the channel, you're my favorite gaming related channel at this point"
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,nosaJay19,2,Sun Apr 19 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"There's information on how to save Kate on this page.  I'm really enjoying this series as well, I can't wait for the next episode to come out."
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,mikeburnfire,2,Sat Apr 18 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"Seems like Jon got very close to succeeding, but the barrier for success has to exist somewhere. It all came down to choosing the wrong passage. She needed more to live for than justice against Nathan."
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,BritishPretender,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"I really thought you were going to save Kate near the end. I made all the wrong choices (didn't step in against David, told her not to report Nathan, told her I didn't know what the right answer was, etc) and she jumped almost immediately, so you at least came closer than I did.  However, I've been playing it very low-key against Nathan. I didn't report him in Ep1 and didn't report or accuse him in Ep2. I'm thinking that I can get closer to him if he doesn't see me as a threat. Also, I got David Madsen kicked off school grounds as a result, so it'll be interesting to see how our stories differ.  Great game so far, can't wait to play it some more and then see your reaction.  Also, if you had tried both the options with shooting/not-shooting Frank, you'd see that you don't actually shoot him, just scare him off. That's probably why you're in the minority on that choice."
ManyATrueNerd,331rz4,jackzer0,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:43:00 2015 UTC,Why do i have the feeling that Nathan might've unlocked the door because he might've known Kate would try to kill herself.....
ManyATrueNerd,330stq,Liamdonahue7,5,Sat Apr 18 11:53:40 2015 UTC,"That'd be like asking him to step back into a pile of dog poop, but with a different pair of shoes."
ManyATrueNerd,330stq,MeatLikeSubstance,3,Sat Apr 18 14:26:27 2015 UTC,I approve of this analogy. 25 MATN points.
ManyATrueNerd,330stq,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's  switching to ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" which I suspect may be like stepping in poop, going home and changing your shoes, stepping very carefully over the previous poop before landing squarely in another almost identical poop."
ManyATrueNerd,330stq,SolarMechanic,2,Sat Apr 18 21:39:24 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the last video he did on it?  He's abandoning the game, it's just a tad to awful."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Maklemoomilk,23,Sat Apr 18 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"By this point, we'll probably have a good, what, 45, 50 episodes of the series?  I'd say call it quits.  Nothing is going to really kill him at that point except small hits adding up over a long period of time, and that would take too long to be interesting.  If he can make it through the motherfucking Divide unscathed, then fuck it, he wins."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,alexxerth,15,Sat Apr 18 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"If he makes it through Dead Money without blowing his collar, I'll be impressed. Hell, if he survives Dead Money at all I'll be impressed."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,JackTheFlying,3,Sat Apr 18 05:50:23 2015 UTC,I'll be impressed if he makes it through OWB. I seem to remember a certain roboscorpion and dog that could present issues...
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Troggie42,4,Sat Apr 18 09:00:21 2015 UTC,The giant roboscorpion isn't too bad if you know how to deal with it.
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,JackTheFlying,4,Sat Apr 18 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"I got lucky, he kinda glitched or something and never moved, so I got far away and used large ammunition.  Gabe on the other hand..."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Troggie42,7,Sat Apr 18 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"The explosive collar in Dead Money will absolutely kill him. I know people said the same thing about the robo-scorpions, but the collar is a completely different animal. IIRC there's several instances with multiple radios that are very trial and error. In addition, it's very easy to take massive amounts of damage when getting to/escaping from the vault."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,FinalFate,8,Sat Apr 18 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"There's not a single radio in dead money that really requires you to die to figure it out. A bit of running back and forth and environment analyzing is all you need, I checked it recently. His real issue is going to be ghost people and the cloud. Most cloud sections you can't sneak through. And a lot are followed by ghost people with spears and bombs."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Martient712,3,Sat Apr 18 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"After watching this entire series and knowing how meticulous Jon is with things I don't see the collars being an issue at all. I'm far less careful and I didn't have an issue with them - it just takes careful listening and precaution. I think the cloud and ghost people would be more likely to do him in just because you can't avoid either. Plus, just the way the ghost people behave and attack.  One mistake especially early on when he has nothing to fight with is all it would take."

ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,xiMbd03u1,5,Sat Apr 18 05:12:52 2015 UTC,Time for something new I'd say.  He's gotten plenty of mileage out of the series.
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Walstiber,12,Sat Apr 18 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"If he survives all the DLC, I'd like to see hm do all the sidequests of the Thorn. Let's see if he's clever enough to gather cazadore and deathclaw eggs without getting hit."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,clonetrooper250,10,Sat Apr 18 00:29:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what Bleed Me Dry is."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,clonetrooper250,7,Sat Apr 18 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Facepalm Ah, probably could've taken 5 seconds to look it up."

ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,anikm21,6,Sat Apr 18 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"He did, with a ton of stimpacks."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,robblatt,2,Sat Apr 18 05:03:27 2015 UTC,Right. Hmmm....
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,mesocyclonic4,4,Sat Apr 18 05:22:37 2015 UTC,The deathclaw eggs aren't actually that hard to do without getting hit. Long distance sneak attack crits with the AMR are enough to take out most of the deathclaws in Quarry Junction...at least on normal.
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Squoghunter1492,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't get hit once in the Quarry on Very Hard, but you really do need to have Implant GRX to outrun the deathclaws. It also took a full clip of hollow point from the Medicine Stick to drop them, but still. It's entirely doable."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,robblatt,4,Mon Apr 20 16:00:06 2015 UTC,Clear out the quarry.

ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,RealFoxD,4,Sat Apr 18 05:00:02 2015 UTC,Deathclaw Promontory.  Or the nuked areas you can unlock in Lonesome Road. Those should do him in.
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,DBrody6,6,Sat Apr 18 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"Even with Rad-X at maximum Medicine skill, you're dead inside of four minutes in the Courier's Mile.  But Deathclaw Promontory would be a wonderful final act---win or lose.  Win, and we just call him the GOAT."
ManyATrueNerd,32zc8u,Ihaveamat,2,Sat Apr 18 05:11:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but there's no purpose to the Courier's Mile. There's two warheads for an achievement and that's about it. And like fifty deathclaws that'll two-shot you. And 35+ rads/second. It's an area that's sorta just there but serves absolutely no ulterior purpose other than expediting your death.

ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Apr 13 08:53:04 2015 UTC,"Really doesn't have to be that much Jon, I would say for a pretty darn great rig you could do it with no more than £700 and still have it last for years. If you do decide to spend that much for your rig, then you should get similar parts and just go for water cooling for a more silent build and increase audio quality as sometimes fans can get quite loud."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Cowgus,5,Mon Apr 13 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"Oh Lord no - the idea of water cooling terrifies me - and did even before Nerdcubed's water cooled computer broke, and electrocuted him to hospital."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can be scary to think about putting water anywhere near your build but what Nerdcubed had was a custom kit. What you should get is an all in one which attaches like a fan to your CPU and then runs, pre assembled, to the top of your case. No fuss, no danger."

ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,AdolfMcSexy,5,Mon Apr 13 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain on UK pricing, but as is I would not go for the 960. A 280/280X will beat it in any instance for the same price.A 280X is perfect for single monitor 1080P gaming on Ultra/Very High settings.  Jon will more than likely not overclock, so I would go for a cheaper more powerful AMD GPU and get a locked i7.    An aftermarket cooler isn't a requirement if he isn't overclocking either, so put that towards the CPU as well.   I'll put together a build later today. It is awful late here."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Daepilin,4,Mon Apr 13 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents: you really want to get an i5 or i7,amd is just too weak at the moment. Especially for video editing you will feel the difference.   Other than that 16gigs of ram are beneficial for editing and if possible an 280x or stronger. You want a ssd and ofc extra space for footage and the final videos."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Droppinbodies,3,Mon Apr 13 10:51:15 2015 UTC,"also worth noting, i can get jon a windows key for 30 pounds, I'm also a PC hardware reviewer. (I write for www.technologyx.com) Jon if you're reading this I'd recommend the AMD system if you want to save some money, I'll be doing tests to prove how close intel and AMD are in games for the price. (I'm actually working on benching GTA on a bunch of different hardware when it unlocks tomorrow."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,ManyATrueNerd,2,Mon Apr 13 09:31:29 2015 UTC,"He will be doing a lot of video rendering as well, keep that in mind."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Droppinbodies,2,Mon Apr 13 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yep - perfect scenario will be that it can record, play and render simultaneously..."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,best4bond,2,Mon Apr 13 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"The AMD 8 cores are better than i5's at multitasking since they have more threads. I can show you some benchmarks to prove how much better the i7 is over the 8core and if its worth it.   For the rendering and playing at the same time (AMD And Nvidia have solid recording solutions that don't effect performance too much) That would be something that I would use on either the i7 4790K, i5, or AMD 8 core, you would need something on Intels ""Enthusiasts"" platform it'd run you something like this   http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/dd7T99  It's a 6 core CPU with 12 threads (Basically meaning faster rendering, kind of like a V6 vs a V8)   That being said you can save about 40 quid on the Motherboard and CPU cooler this is just better than the cheapest stuff. If you plan on spending 1,000 this might be doable if you can swing getting some free hardware."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Cowgus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"Sure AMD 8 cores are better at multitasking, but your trading power for multitasking, which for rendering video you really don't want to do."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Cowgus,3,Fri Apr 17 08:47:46 2015 UTC,"For basic outlined specs I would put forward the following:  *Intel i5 Quad core (3rd or 4th gen) - good enough for editing and great for gaming. *AMD 280/290x - pure power to pound ratio, beats out the similarly Nvidia GTX 960. *8GB of DDR3 RAM - Jon will probably not find much benefit in forking out for DDR4. *Whatever cheap M-ITX board that supports this - if not overclocking, why pay for more? *Fairly cheap case that will be simple and easy to build with (maybe Corsair?). *250GB SSD (for booting) - Makes PC use in general faster. *2/4TB HDD (dependent on budget) - Plenty of storage space for game recordings and editing."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,dabisnit,3,Mon Apr 13 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"In short, swap that 960 for a 280/90x"
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,ManyATrueNerd,2,Mon Apr 13 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"It would have to be 280. If he was going to get a 290 or 290x, it would be better if he went for a 970."

ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Apr 13 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I got help when putting my PC together the first time. What I would recommend though is to do it with them, have them talk through it with you. Then you can be more confident and prepared if for some reason it doesn't boot or something. Also in the future, you may feel more confident about doing it yourself."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,paleoreef103,2,Mon Apr 13 16:16:59 2015 UTC,I watched countless videos on how to build mine. I still ran into trouble in about three places. I would have loved to pay someone $50 to build it for me.

ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,docgear,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:27:23 2015 UTC,I agree.  If he's got the budget an i7 for rendering would be excellent though just a 4790 instead of 4790K would work if he's not overclocking. This also cuts down on the need for an expensive aftermarket cooler though it might be nice for longevity and noise reduction to have a Evo 212.  The R9 280/280x is loads better than a 960 for the price and performance.  It's an excellent card while the 960 is kind of underwhelming. A 128 SSD works for booting as well if you are shaving the price down.
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,dabisnit,2,Tue Apr 14 16:51:07 2015 UTC,Do they have some sort of gift buy option?  I would totally buy a part off the list to help the man out.

ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,AdolfMcSexy,2,Mon Apr 13 08:51:30 2015 UTC,The best you could do is porbably have someone like Crucial sponsor a few of your videos in exchage for some RAM and maybe an SSD or two.
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,paleoreef103,2,Mon Apr 13 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"Not a bad build, it's actually pretty similar to my own box. I need to bump up my ram, and I've only got a 750 Ti. Pretty happy with it, but it could definitely use a lot more GPU for the newer games at 1080p."
ManyATrueNerd,32dxsi,Yogurt_Huevos,2,Mon Apr 13 04:57:22 2015 UTC,"I really like the first AMD build xRzcN. But I don't know enough about AMD CPUs to know which is good and which is better. A CPU cooler is unnecessary unless you are over clocking.   I built this one to skimp on everything that's able to be skimped on.

The area is basically all lobotomites though, so watch out for the ones with guns.  As for Gabe, that fight might cost you some hit points if you're not careful. Also remember that after he dies a ton of roboscorpions spawn inside of Gabe's boss room, the room where you fought the orderly robots (with the coffins), the main entrance upstairs, and right outside of the main entrance itself.

Just run away before it self-destructs.   Of course you'd probably think that's too risky so...wouldn't a Stealth Boy before entering the arena and then sneaking over to the self-destruct science terminal also work?

ManyATrueNerd,32cvzv,Revelations216,10,Mon Apr 13 03:29:22 2015 UTC,"About Little Yangtze (the prison camp in Big MT): I don't think it's particularly dark in comparison to the rest of Fallout, as there are related themes in other Games/DLCs. It fulfilled a similar purpose to the Turtledove Detention Camp in Point Lookout. Prisoners of those camps were allegedly spies and saboteurs in the Sino-American war. There is also proof of intelligence operations in Fallout, like the Spy quest line in Point Lookout, so some of the prisoners were probably spies.    And while the Great War only lasted a few hours, the Sino-American War raged for over ten years, beginning with the invasion of Alaska in 2066 and ending with the Great War in 2077.    Concerning the video: I liked today's episode very much, as you revealed some interesting facts and nice loot for the people who aren't fallout nuts. You could have told the viewers about Elijah's LAER (as you stood right next to the tower it's located) and the Splicing Lab (just telling them would be a valuable info and it only costs 10 seconds), and also that the three Lobotomites that are spawned by Christine's COS Rifle might instantly go into search or attack mode, depending on your sneaking ability. (I think I never got away without aggroing them, tbh. Could be just bad luck.)    Aside from that, I think this was one of the best episodes, it had information on lore and gameplay, fights and Jon. 10/10"

You can disable the forcefield it is on and have it fall to its death for an easy and completely safe kill.    As for Gabe himself...I'd take a Turbo and try and .45 Auto him to death before he can really get into his attack pattern.  After he goes down, you are supposed to check all the grave sites, but there's a count down to his explosion.  What you can do is simply leave after killing Gabe, wait a bit, then come back in and there's no danger of the explosion.  I believe Roboscorpions will spawn through the facility after you pick up the frequency from the grave...I know that three Roboscorpions will spawn in Gabe's room immediately once you have found it, so you'll probably have to fight those, but after that, I'd just stealth boy all the way out.  Too much to fight, too dangerous.  Also, I'm gonna be mad if you don't pick up Dr. Mobius' Glove, since it should be the solution to your no kill run Hard Luck Blues conundrum.    Also, I'm surprised you didn't go to that Watch tower at Little Yangtze and pick up an Elijah's Advanced LAER.  I know one person here has been singing its praises.

It is overall the best Sonic Emitter, and Jon should consider switching to it.    With Silent Running, he should be able to ignore Gabe, and Gabe will then be an excellent distraction to book it out of the area when the roboscorpions spawn.

ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,BrickAlbus,19,Sun Apr 12 23:56:50 2015 UTC,I like New Vegas because it's skill based. With 3 you can save before any speech check and try it enough to pass. Seems kinda easy if you're willing to grind it out.
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,robblatt,11,Mon Apr 13 01:26:21 2015 UTC,"I like the method in New Vegas, because it makes sense.  Grind skill, open up reward tree.  In Fallout 3, you're rewarded for save scumming, or conversely you're punished for playing an RPG using standard RPG strategies.  Any mechanic that puts randomness into a dialogue tree is by definition badly designed.  Then again, New Vegas in general is so vastly superior in design and execution to Fallout 3 that I kind of want to see Obsidian take a whack at an Elder Scrolls game."
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,RealFoxD,12,Mon Apr 13 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"I've got to say New Vegas, because Fallout 3's wasn't balanced well against any other skill in the game - anything else, if you had, say, Science 70, you passed Science 70 checks. But speech - you could get it to 100 and still sometimes fail speech checks anyway.  So I like NV better, but, equally, the NV method made Charisma almost completely pointless (given I find companions overpowered even with Charisma 1 so nerve isn't that useful), so they need to find something to use Charisma for - maybe something like reward scaling? Ie, if you pass a quest and have high charisma, they're likely to give you more money as a reward as they like you? Maybe more reputation with a faction per positive action, or reduced reputation loss if you do something bad?"
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,ManyATrueNerd,8,Mon Apr 13 08:57:50 2015 UTC,"In the early Fallout games, more charisma meant you could have more companions simultaneously. I'd like to see Fallout 4 do something with that. Obviously there'd need to be some rebalancing, because the FNV companions are so strong that having 5 of them in your party would be overpowered."
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,petenu,3,Mon Apr 13 09:02:24 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, however, in a first person RPG I feel having that many companions would result in too much chaos for the player. It's hard enough to control the movements and tactics of one companion in the latter fallout games; imagine trying to coordinate that of 5! Stealth would be thrown to the wind, not the mention the unbearable amount of crossfire. It also brings about the possibly of so much AI glitching. I feel I'm inclined to agree with the suggestions made by Jon, however, maybe this would make charisma too desirable of a skill?"
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,bolsey,3,Mon Apr 13 09:50:16 2015 UTC,"I played a low charisma courier for the first time recently and noticed a few differences, like everybody going hostile when I tried to steal that skill book from under the counter at the Mojave outpost (usually I just get caught and then buy it), and the guy in Sloan refusing to let me take care of their deathclaw problem at level 2 or 3."

ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,stealingyourpotatos,22,Sat Apr 18 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"I find the new Vegas method of speech checks to be superior, because with Fallout 3, you could have minimal speech and pass a speech check, or maxed out speech and fail a speech check. New Vegas makes it so that if you have the right level, then you've won the speech check.  Also, I enjoy the way your level affects what you say in New Vegas."
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,GoatMarine,3,Mon Apr 13 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"NV, because with FO3 you can just save and reload before a conversation to win any speech check, making speech a completely useless skill.  In NV, you actually need to put points in if you want some of the benefits."
ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,LeapingMudcrab,4,Mon Apr 13 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"New Vegas. I like how depending on whether you pass or not you're going to say different - less/more convincing/intimidating - lines, instead of game randomly deciding if it works or not.

ManyATrueNerd,32dvn8,Sandwich247,6,Mon Apr 13 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 for sure. I like it the same way I like Skyrim lockpicking (though not a fan of Skyrim myself). It means you can do it no matter your skill, just need some fortune to come your way."

After you are done moving, i would cast my first vote for Mass Effect 2 and my second vote goes to Alpha Protocol. My third and last vote goes towards the latest Shadowrun, which is the Director's Cut i believe is it called. Very decent game and interesting universe, although the dialogues answers (i.e. your character's choices) are fully fleshed out, which might make it a bit tough to work with.   Both are rather good and can be completed in a quick fashion. They also lend themselves to a lot of different rulesets, should one of them (or both) enthrall you. And they follow the same-ish formula of dialogue trees."

ManyATrueNerd,3297bo,Aduckonquack97,-1,Sat Apr 11 20:35:36 2015 UTC,I can respect that. Personally I'd rather have no guns than everyone owning guns. There really are a few people in the US that have this cold-war-esque mentality where everyone should own guns and that would make crime go down because of the concept of mutually assured destruction.
ManyATrueNerd,3297bo,Aduckonquack97,2,Sat Apr 11 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"I once heard an very interesting take on the second amendment, where somebody pointed out that the time it was written, guns were vastly slower to use, slower to reload, less accurate, and less powerful. The ease and destructive power of modern weaponry (the very possibility that a kid with an assault weapon could conduct a school massacre) was completely unforeseeable at the time, but the law has failed to keep pace with weaponry. It's an interesting point, aside from the small issue that Britain isn't still planning to invade ((though if we were, that's exacly what we'd want you to think...))"

Oregon only requires concealed carry permits and allows open carry. In Washington State, thanks to Initiative 594 passing in the last election cycle, you need a background check before any sale or transfer of guns. A museum even had to return all the guns donated to them for a World War II exhibit because they hadn't gone through background checks for all of them.   EDIT: My mistake, there is an Arcadia in Washington State. Chloe is definitely defying the law."
ManyATrueNerd,3297bo,HackBlowfist,2,Sun Apr 12 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"Washington has FAR from the strictest gun laws in the country. Until I-594 it had quite a bit less than most other states, and while it's shifted to the left, it's still far more lax than say, California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, or Massachusetts by almost any standard.   Of course, the game is set in Oregon (not sure why you crossed that out and put WA), but in any state, taking someone else's gun without permission is theft and is going to be against the law to some degree or another."

ManyATrueNerd,321idb,thirdtotheleft,6,Thu Apr 9 21:07:16 2015 UTC,I like the current level of editing in your videos perfectly. There's always plenty of entertainment without it being reduced to a 4 minute smosh video with just laughter and so much missing.
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,_JackDoe_,10,Fri Apr 10 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"I have but one truly important question that I must know the answer to Jon. Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur?"
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,GamesterPowered,13,Thu Apr 9 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"I went Squirtle, but I loved Red/Blue if you went Charmader, because the game properly screwed you, as everything was worthless against Onix. You want to choose Charmader? Then I hope you like training a Butterfree to level 12, you scum."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,pvtanima,3,Fri Apr 10 10:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'd just grab a Pickachu for Misty, level my Charmander until it's evolution and just struggle past Brock."

ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Gnome_Warfare,9,Fri Apr 10 15:27:33 2015 UTC,Ever played any of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games?
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Kiefer_N7,11,Thu Apr 9 21:19:26 2015 UTC,Shadow of Chernobyl for like a couple of hours. I actually kind of liked it.
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,stevethebandit,10,Thu Apr 9 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"What is your favourite game, excluding any of the stuff you have done on the channel? :D"
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,nboland1989,11,Thu Apr 9 20:52:59 2015 UTC,Depends how you define it.  I think Rome Total War (the original) has probably eaten more hours of my life than any other. I guess I'd probably say Fallout New Vegas is my favourite game. Mass Effect 2 wins best score. Skies of Arcadia best story. Pokemon Silver (original) best techical achievement. Resident Evil 4 best mechanics.
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,rustbatman,6,Thu Apr 9 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"Ha Fallout New Vegas is up there with my favourites, loved you series on it. Thanks for answering."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,vacodeus,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"Rome Total War is a masterpiece!!!!!!!! Shame Rome 2 sucked at launch, but it's a lot better now after many many patches."

ManyATrueNerd,321idb,TheWanderingDinosuar,17,Thu Apr 9 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, totally."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,TheWanderingDinosuar,3,Thu Apr 9 21:22:03 2015 UTC,Speaking of PC Fallout when will this happen? Also out of curiosity have you played them before or will this be more of a blind run?
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,xiMbd03u1,4,Fri Apr 10 04:41:47 2015 UTC,Would you possibly do mod reviews?
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,TOHSNBN,8,Fri Apr 10 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"Did you ever consider a sort of Brit Lab, Tom Scott type of spin off/series for the channel? I get that that kind of production value is hard to do as a side project but I feel that you could pull off those  sort of educational (ancient history) kind of videos. Is there a video that you really debated about uploading but ended up binning?    and finally: 3. What are the first games you remember playing?  Keep on doing what you are doing! I enjoy your content and the unique way you approach certain games."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Walstiber,8,Thu Apr 9 22:05:46 2015 UTC,"With infinite time, I'd love to just ramble about stuff - maybe more like Extra Credits' Extra History series, but for myths? That's worth a thought."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Seniornosleep,3,Thu Apr 9 22:14:13 2015 UTC,That sounds absolutely amazing. I recall you having a short rant in a recent video about a historical inaccuracy and really enjoyed it. The reason I brought it up is that I feel that you are very enthusiastic about history/myths and seem like you would like to spread that enthusiasm and knowledge to a younger generation others.
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Gold900,7,Thu Apr 9 22:20:28 2015 UTC,What is your favourite series you have made?
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Bookworm12k,35,Thu Apr 9 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"Has to be Fallout 3 Kill Everything, with a Practical Guide to Parenting (Episode 7) my favourite video of all."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,the61scissors,11,Thu Apr 9 21:19:05 2015 UTC,That's the video that introduced me to your channel! I think you or maybe someone else posted it to r/fallout. I got perhaps 5 minutes in before I subscribed. It's still my favourite video to date!
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,MrCandybar,3,Thu Apr 9 21:41:22 2015 UTC,Exactly the same story here
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,PantsBonanza,3,Thu Apr 9 21:55:22 2015 UTC,I agree. Probably the most worrying episode you've ever done haha
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Qwarr,3,Thu Apr 9 21:24:06 2015 UTC,I'm rewatching the series for the third time and that episode plus the first episode when you killed Butch's mom and pretended she was still alive were my favorite parts of the series.
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Qwarr,7,Fri Apr 10 08:56:45 2015 UTC,"1) With you playing Life is Strange (and seemingly enjoying it) will we see you play other episodic games like Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, or Tales From The Borderlands?  2) Favorite authors?"
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,TheRealMe99,15,Thu Apr 9 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"Y'know the weird thing about Telltale Games? They are actually anti-YouTuber - they do't allow monetisation of their games, despite the huge numbers of people that do so.  I honestly don't know what to do about that - I keep my channel squeaky clean and I don't want to play with publishers who don't want me there. Tales from Borderlands is the same - 2K are horribly anti-YouTube.  That's why I leapt on Life Is Strange - Square Enix are actually decent to YouTubers.  This is ultimately how I have to evaluate things - are these people YouTube-friendly, safe, and likely to cause me any trouble? And Telltale Games, I just don't know.  As for authors, Jasper Fforde. Love him."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,TheRealMe99,3,Thu Apr 9 21:30:33 2015 UTC,Fair point about Telltale. I didn't know.  Thank you for the response!!
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,thirdtotheleft,7,Fri Apr 10 03:23:58 2015 UTC,Would you rather fight 10 deathclaw sized behemoths or 1 behemoth sizes deathclaw?
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,OllieStanley,16,Thu Apr 9 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"1 behemoth sized deathclaw - because that's kind of the lengendary deathclaw, and I know I can kill that bastard already."
ManyATrueNerd,321idb,Seniornosleep,5,Thu Apr 9 22:19:09 2015 UTC,Wow that kinda makes sense

Extra History, by the Extra Credits guys - I love how fun they make history - I want to do smething similar for the ancient myths.  Jasper Fforde, Robert Harris  I just finished reading Persepolis - fun little story, that.

ManyATrueNerd,321idb,chalkman,5,Thu Apr 9 21:40:35 2015 UTC,Was that the thing where you said in one of your NV videos you were going to make a character called Doc Mitchell who looks exactly like him then instantly murder him? (did you even say that or am I getting this mixed up with something else?)

I don't feel personal allegiance to any of them - I'm not particularly tribal - and I don't feel any of them speak for me, but that's probably part of the UK's wider political issue that young people get a very bad deal in terms of their issues and priorities being politically represented.  I will vote in the general election, but I'll ultimately make my decision on local grounds (has the MP done a good job representing the area, or does another candidate sound better at that), not party grounds."

ManyATrueNerd,31xbah,Lily-Olivia,43,Wed Apr 8 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"Jon aka. ManyATrueNerd was born in 1926, in the most well-known Gentleman Pineapple family in North Britain, but at the age of 5 he rebelled against his family and murdered them all, his gentleman pineapple father, gentleman pineapple mother and his two gentlemen pineapple daughters Tim and Tom. 1967 he began studying law and in 1962 he finally got his degree and started working as a farmer in Russia. In 1986 he moved back to Britain with his girlfriend Bonnie Bogh Bugsen and his dog Blurpels. In 1999 he murdered Bonnie Bogh Bugsen after finding out she didn’t give enough treats to Blurpels. In 2006 he moved to a parallel dimension to marry Claire (a parallel dimension version of himself). In 2013 he started a YouTube channel known as ManyATrueNerd with Claire and is a fast growing YouTube channel. It features all kinds of gaming and its most popular series are FALLOUT 3 and Fallout New Vegas: Kill everything where Jon attempts to kill every living thing.  Source: Wikipedia"

ManyATrueNerd,31t3x9,olib123,3,Wed Apr 8 04:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of the occasionally vlog would be really cool, all things considered. I think it would be cool to have just a serious, somewhat personal (?) chat of sorts, and have some general game play in the background, or maybe the MATN animation playing so that it isn't distracting for some people. Not to mention, if you were so inclined, there could even be some humorous/funny/silly vlogs scattered throughout on occasion.   Another thing I think might be kinda cool to see, if only once in a blue moon, would be some more live action skits/videos/things. One of my favorite videos that originally got me into the MATN mindset/fan-club was the How to Bake a Cake video. I can completly understand that it might be difficult/annoying to come up with ideas for skits and the like, but if inspiration strikes, and Many A True Jon feels merciful, I think it could be a cool thing to do once in a great while, if only for the silly factor of it.

ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,ManyATrueNerd,13,Tue Apr 7 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"I work in an industry where we put out a ton of content for free and only generate revenue from <5% (often <2%) of our users, so I know this battle.  One thing to remember is that users will usually do what's best for them in the long term, regardless of anything else. While some day disable adblock for a day or two on youtube, it will soon get re-enabled when they get some annoying video with ads in the middle or they get a string of ads for products they really don't care about.  What I am trying to say is that the 30% of users who don't use adblock is probably about as high as you will ever get, so put the focus onto growing the subscriber base so that that 30% becomes more users which will impact the bottom line much more than going from 30% non adblock to 32% non adblock.  Love the channel and you are the only Youtuber I actually enjoy listening to, keep up the awesome work."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,olib123,10,Tue Apr 7 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I suspect you may right - from seeing figures published elsewhere, 30% seems reasonable.   One thing I didn't mention in the video was the role of the YouTuber to be responsible - if we expect viewers to not use adblock, then we need to be decent and not use mid-roll ads."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,Martient712,3,Tue Apr 7 21:33:44 2015 UTC,I got mid-roll add the other day and unsubscribed immediately to a content producer I have enjoyed for years.
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,hells_cowbells,8,Tue Apr 7 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"They're just an awful idea.  Post-rolls I'm not sure on. I was ok with the idea, until I remembered how many people watch videos within a playlist - then you get a post-roll, then a pre-roll for the next video, so almost a little ad break of two ads - that's too much, so I'm not sure they're cool."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,dabisnit,3,Tue Apr 7 22:15:05 2015 UTC,Does the producer decide where ads go? I thought YouTube did that.
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,dabisnit,6,Wed Apr 8 03:46:36 2015 UTC,"There are a few channels I whitelist: you, LinusTechTips, Candito Training HQ, Gopher, and BroscienceLife. They all put out quality content for free (though LTT did move over to vessel with a free one year subscription they worked out with vesssel, and release their youtube videos a week or so later).   Brosciencelife has it down packed though. They sell t-shirts, supplements, people pay to be guests on their show, and have sponsorships too from Audible.com, ting phone service, and thirsties (alcohol delivery). The trick for him is to make it funny enough so that people want to watch it."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,olib123,5,Tue Apr 7 21:32:01 2015 UTC,And how do you feel about Brosciencelife for that? I honestly don't know if there's a point it goes too far...
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,Cowgus,3,Tue Apr 7 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"I think it works for him. His supplements are his own, his sponsorships are from unrelated products so there is less of a conflict of interest like LinusTechTips advertising for Intel processors. Since he makes it funny, I always watch his sponsorships. The trick is to make it worth my time to watch his Audible.com sponsorship.   I really don't mind him doing this."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,Cowgus,3,Tue Apr 7 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"True - I think Hey Ash Whatcha Playing traditionally did that well, with clearly labelled sponsored videos which were still funny."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,olib123,2,Tue Apr 7 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"I think Brolifescience makes it funny because the whole thing is a parody so being over the top is funny. For something like MATD you could still do it with direct ads, i.e. sponsorship for a string of videos from a specific advertiser (while avoiding a conflict of interest). To get direct ad deals is hard unless you are very well known.  One option might be to contact the companies that make some equipment you want (e.g. headphones, mic, mouse keyboard, PCs) and offer to do a ""Today's video was brought to you by the Logitech 500, goto Logitech.com for more info"".

For instance, although expensive, a server could be great that just rolled around to whatever game you are playing. Therefore you get a fun server to play on and the community gets a bit more interactive. If pricing is a concern, you could go to already large and popular servers that can cope with capacity (e.g. Nerdcubed's Just Cause server) and organise community days, where you set a date and time for the community to hop on a server and play with you for a while.  Just a thought to chew over."

ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,SuffolksSecretSauce,5,Wed Apr 8 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"For me the reason of AdBlock is mostly habit, honestly whenever I don't have AdBlock installed I don't get as many annoying ads as a few years back. However I want to decide whenever or not a page gets money for me visting them.  Youtube among others is unblocked though, for the reasons you stated. The people on there are providing me with free content and they should get something for their work. I know some offer others to support them, but the thing is I only have this much money but would want to support that much creators.  Also I don't see an as bad picture about sponsored content as you do. I think it's completly okay and up to the person if they do it as long as they disclose the information that they got paid for doing the video. So no backroom deal or whatever, but be up front about it. Let your fans and viewers know and they'll decide if they watch or not."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,SuffolksSecretSauce,10,Tue Apr 7 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"Disclosure and transparency is great, but it's only half the problem.  If I played a game, and announced I was being paid to play it, you know there's a good chance the published saw the video first, or insisted what I could or couldn't show.  If I say the game's good, do you believe me? I think it undermines trust and generally what ought to be a fairly close and friendly and trusting relationship between viewer and creator."

You are right there might be, but then again I'm trusting on you as a person to not take such deals. For me that would fall under ""backroom deal"", because even through you say you have made a deal with the publisher there is still some stuff going on that I don't know about. Maybe I should've phrased it different in the first post, if you disclose not only that there was a deal, but what deal it was you took, then it's okay. For example let's say the publisher invites you and others to a tourney to test a multiplayer game and you say so before the video I think it would be okay.   If I say the game's good, do you believe me? I think it undermines trust and generally what ought to be a fairly close and friendly and trusting relationship between viewer and creator.   I don't believe anybody really if they say a game is good, because tastes are different, that's why I watch so many gameplay videos on Youtube or streams, to see the gameplay myself and to be able to decide if I would like the game or not. Granted I may not see the bugs then, but I tend to only get anoyed by really game breaking ones. Maybe I'm weird because of it, but the one thing that I find better about Youtube agains traditional games media is that even if you say a game is good and I don't like it the trust bond is not broken, as long as you were not activly lying about it. Who am I to decide you can't think a game is good? There are many people out there who think games are good, where I just shake my head in disbelieve, because I don't think they are good.  I honestly like your standpoint though, it's way better than taking deals and don't disclose them at all and after all it's your decision to make. Just keep up the good work, I enjoy your videos :)"

It's not so much that I'm ""sticking it to the man"", it's just that ads intrude on my internet experience in a negative way. I don't like them, and I don't have to view them, so I don't.  I recognise that affects you negatively as a content producer, and that does bother me (especially since your content is something I greatly enjoy).   I think a donation model like Patreon is the best solution, and as soon as I stop being piss poor (hopefully soon! I just got a new client!), you can bet I'll be donating, but I just cannot disable ads. The aggravation and intrusion of them is just not something I'm comfortable with.   To hit the point home, before I started using adblock, I couldn't stand to use youtube. As in, I literally never visited or used youtube.

They use tech that for some time has been easily 'beaten' with the ad blockers. Google will only act if they do not get the results they desire and that's not looking likely right now. So what to do? You seem to only have one choice... at the start of every one your own videos ask the viewer to switch off the blocker. They will or won't. Add an a notation to a video explaining why you want it off and let the consumer decide. Just don't get into bed with huge mega tubers who already earn huge cash.

ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,ZeamiEnnosuke,2,Tue Apr 7 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"Great discussion, Jon! A couple of thoughts:  -My understanding (and Jon would know better than I) is that ads only count as paid views if the viewer watches the whole ad. If this is true-I believe TotalBiscuit said this at one point-then Youtube does content creators a pretty big disservice by not having a limit on ad length (I assume creators can't control this?). I won't skip a 15 sec. ad unless it's a channel I don't want to get revenue. I'll usually watch a 30 sec. ad for channels I like, like MATN. Longer than that, I usually skip, especially on mobile. Sometimes, YouTube serves up a 4 minute+ ad, which is absurd, especially when it's sometimes half the length of the video following it. And, even if partial views count for revenue, 4+ minute ads will still encourage AdBlock use.  -Your commitment to not having a delay for non-""payers"" is awesome. One of my other favorite Youtubers does this, and while it doesn't really bother me that much, it does produce two ""classes"" of fans as you describe. For MATN specifically, a paywall would impact the great discussions here about your videos, especially the F:NV YOLO run ones.  -I remember reading someone discussing how YouTube missed the boat on creator funding by letting Patreon and other companies spring up without a Google/YouTube option. The idea you discussed for a true ""subscription"" option that allows people to pay to remove ads would let YouTube start to rectify that. If they did, you would likely see what the PC gaming and music/movie industries have seen over the last decade and a half: give people an easy, inexpensive way to pay for content they like, and they will pay. Patreon is already an example of this, and YouTube integrating it will make even more successful."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,Sarsticus,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"I think YT wants to integrate that system, but it's imperfect - their commitment to the largely unused Google Wallet is a pain, for example...

And, even if partial views count for revenue, 4+ minute ads will still encourage AdBlock use.   This, so much. I hate that feeling when Youtube offers me up an absurd long ad because I realize that skipping the ad won't help a content creator. If I wanted to watch ads that long, I would turn on my television. And considering I haven't used my TV in about three years, I think that says a lot."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,QT_Luna,2,Wed Apr 8 04:23:28 2015 UTC,"Why I started using adblock (or now, uBlock).  I started using adblack when my bandwidth was severely limited, and the ads were literally taking longer to load than the videos I wanted to watch.  I was stuck in the hospital at the time (a grand total of five months), and adblock made youtube usable again.  During this time I managed to watch all of FO3 and FNV kill every thing, FNV no kill, and the start of FNV YOLO.  These series were awesome and I thank Jon for making them.  Why I continued using adblock?  Quite frankly, my internet experience was simply better.  When I got home from the hospital and booted up my desktop and was again bombarded with ads, I immediately installed adblock.  I used to think that ads were something I owed the content creators to watch because I wanted them to be able to make more videos, but then I didn't realize the experience I was missing out on.  Not being bombarded with ads is great, but I also understand why they need to be there.  I wish I wasn't such a selfish person to not want to waste thirty seconds of my life watching content I didn't want to see.  If there was a paid way to skip the ads, I feel as though I'd do it in a heartbeat.  How can this improve?  At the moment I think the way that larger podcasts and youtube channels (Adam Carrola Show, Joe Rogan Experience, Nerdist, Giantbomb, LinusTechTips) have integrated ads at the beginning and end is probably the way to go, but that is far from a long term solution.  I should just disable adblock."
ManyATrueNerd,31scm7,hells_cowbells,2,Tue Apr 7 23:40:06 2015 UTC,"When I got home for the hospital and booted up my desktop and was again bombarded with ads   This is the answer for me. The bottom line is that the Internet is incredibly, incredibly annoying without Adblock. Flashing ads, moving ads, popup ads, pop-under ads, blah blah blah. Every time I look over someone's shoulder at a computer that isn't mine, I'm astounded. It's like Las Vegas, with slot machines shouting in your ear constantly.  But I do white-list content providers who I explicitly want to support, so there's that. And I'm also a patreon supporter of you."

It's got medium weight which if I remember, it makes sneaking slightly harder even at max sneak (I was getting caught several times using it, and I had maxed sneak on my stealth-run a couple months back) and while the bonuses are worse, you risk being screwed over by the auto heal. What if you happen to get an automatic stimpak placed into your inventory by a quest or something, only for the suit to automatically heal you afterwards? The most ironic and annoying thing will have been to have survived nearly 30 parts of a Fallout New Vegas playthrough, and get defeated by a suit's auto-heal.  In Addition, and this is important: THE SUIT WILL DISPENSE A STIMPAK IF YOU ARE POISONED BY A CAZADOR AND NOT AN ANTIVENOM so if by chance you are caught, and stung by a Cazador (also possibly any enemy that can poison) then you'd be screwed over by the suit.  In Short: While the bonuses are good, the auto heal is VERY risky for a no heal run and I personally suggest you don't use it. The suit dispenses Stimpak's when you are stung by a Cazador and not an antivenom and you're likely to be screwed over by both the poison-stimpak I mentioned above, and if by chance a quest automatically gives you a few stimpaks resulting in the suit deciding to auto heal you.  Assuming you're very confident in your ability to avoid picking up Stimpaks, avoiding being hit by Cazadors and generally avoiding everything (which you've done good so far) the armour is good, but Cazadors are in the Big MT and I can just forsee the auto-heal screwing you over so I'd stick with what sneaky-attire you've already got that isn't the sneaky-suit."

ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Jethro_McCrazy,2,Sun Apr 5 21:33:26 2015 UTC,What about if you get part way through dead money? Find a cloud to die in?
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Jethro_McCrazy,5,Mon Apr 6 03:07:00 2015 UTC,I'd probably finish it (for a montage of my other successes/failures) then cut to the rollercoaster...
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,NoOneImportant4,13,Mon Apr 6 09:34:40 2015 UTC,"On the subject of Dead Money, there are actually two things you can bring with you. If you get Rawr's hand, it won't be taken from you and you can turn it into Fist of Rawr once you are in the DLC proper. But that requires you fighting a big ass deathclaw.  The other thing is much simpler. Because Motor-runner's helmet is a quest item, it can't be taken from you. DT of 2, +5 Melee, +1 Perception. The only other headgear in Dead Money is Sierra Madre armor, and I don't think you get a chance to grab that right away. You'd have to go through fiend country to get it, but I've never had a problem stealth killing fiends, and once you're in the vault, you can talk your way out of trouble. You can get the helmet from motor-runner with a speech check."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Atomic_Dom,12,Sun Apr 5 21:17:50 2015 UTC,And don't forget the rebreather - that's quest as well
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,NoOneImportant4,7,Sun Apr 5 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"True, but you've already got that. And I don't think you can wear it with a Sierra Madre helmet, while you can with Motor-runner's helmet."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,thirdtotheleft,7,Sun Apr 5 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"Little known fact:  You can also bring a set of Van Graff Combat Armor with you to Dead Money through the Silver Rush quest line.  I think you need to guard the door, then open the chest that is next to Simon and you can get the armor.  I don't know if it's worth bringing off the top of my head, but it's a thought.  You find Sierra Madre Combat Armor really early."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,NoOneImportant4,3,Sun Apr 5 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"You can find a set of the armor off a dead guy in one of the sacked caravan locations, too."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,acksed,6,Mon Apr 6 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that's not marked as a quest item.  It has to be the armor you get from the Silver Rush mission, since it is marked as a quest item."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,petenu,4,Mon Apr 6 02:16:31 2015 UTC,"The implant that gives you the turbo, combined with the flare gun, should make short work of Rawr."

ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Atomic_Dom,8,Tue Apr 7 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"Not to repeat myself, but I'm going to totally repeat myself:  Riot shotguns can be fired a lot faster than that. Although you did seem to figure that out about 26 minutes in.  You have no idea how easy your life would be with a LAER.  An LMG (while absurdly powerful against unarmored opponents) will have basically zero effect on armored opponents. AP rounds help, but its low damage per round still means that other firearms will be preferable against armored opponents. It'll be an effective gun for many purposes, but don't use it on anything with 15 or more DT. This includes Deathclaws.  Demolitions Expert (jacks up the damage of explosive anti-materiel rifle rounds), Robotics Expert, and Better Criticals (assuming you don't have them already) would help you in this DLC."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Grandpa_Edd,3,Mon Apr 6 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've got a few perks to take yet - I need to prioritise between GRX implant, And Stay Back, Demolitions Expert..."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,edichez,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:37:28 2015 UTC,"Those perks are all really good options. In my opinion, GRX is the single deadliest perk in New Vegas, and And Stay Back is your best chance against Tunnelers in the Divide (who will force you to fight in close quarters, are fast, and do a lot of damage). And I mentioned the usefulness of demolitions expert just above.  Also, I just remembered something about the robo scorpions. There's four series of them: ""regular"", ""pincer"", ""blaster"", and ""bomber."" Some roboscorpions (pincers) will only use their claws. It's possible that those don't follow you, like the ones you found recently. In that case, they won't be a challenge. If they do follow you, you can use mines and also target their legs. As for the blaster variants, you can target their stingers to disarm them. Bombers, I don't remember ever seeing them in game. Hope that helps!"
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,bolsey,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:59:15 2015 UTC,"The LAER is great, but I don't think Jon will get around to it."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,bolsey,5,Tue Apr 7 02:50:14 2015 UTC,"Another tip - If a Nightstalker is ever coming at you with no garuntee of a kill, quick switch to a melee weapon and pretty much just run backward while blindly slashing. They can't touch you like that."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,bolsey,3,Mon Apr 6 02:11:36 2015 UTC,"Excellent - I can't recall game it was now, but there was one where as long as you were running away, chasing enemies couldn't touch you - it was only if you turned to them... was it something in Resi 4...?"

ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,thirdtotheleft,5,Mon Apr 6 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"I hope you'll give the sonic emitter a chance.  Gabriel's Bark has a knockback critical effect, massively useful in corridor scorpion fights, and crit kills toss the corpse back a safe distance before it explodes.  Revelation does less damage, but paralysis is great when you're dealing with those pairs of cyberdogs guarding doors in X-8.  With Laser Commander and some max-charged ammo, your stealth/criticals character could one-shot trauma harnesses with that little thing."

ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,hells_cowbells,7,Mon Apr 6 14:28:12 2015 UTC,"A Slug round for the shotgun is a single block of lead that is shot, and essentially makes the shotgun operate as a rifle would (Single large bullet that is effective at range).    As opposed to a Shell, which has many smaller pellets that have a spread and diminish in effectiveness at range.    So in game, any round that has Slg is a slug that essentially turns your shotgun into a rifle.  Edit: Also, you are better off using the light armor for stealth than the upgraded stealth suit.  The penalty for using medium and heavy armor when trying to stealth is huge (Which is why every enemy ever in Honest Hearts saw you from miles away when you were wearing the Heavy power armor)."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Atomic_Dom,2,Mon Apr 6 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"A slug is still a shell. There are loads of different types of shot. Most common in video games is 00 buckshot, 8-12 roughly .30 caliber pellets per shell, depending on the length of the shell, in a 12 gauge at least."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Francois_Rapiste,1 point,Mon Apr 6 10:42:00 2015 UTC,"A 12 ga. slug is the same diameter as a .50 cal round, FYI, but with a lot less powder behind it."

ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,NoOneImportant4,2,Sun Apr 5 21:20:53 2015 UTC,"You can benefit from getting the Hand Loader Perk and/or the Jury Rigging Perk. Hand Loaded will let you craft a new bullet for each type of gun. The bullets have both a damage multiplier like hollow point and are armor piercing, however they do degrade the gun faster. Jury Rigging would be used to repair guns with vaguely similar weapons.   You would need to level repair though."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,ossowicki,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with Jury Rigging when I realised that ordinary NCR Service Rifles could repair my two major go-to silenced weapons, the Sniper Rifle and the 12.7mm SMG.  So much fun seeing my condition on the sniper rifle start to slip (firing the .308 JSP from the Hand Loader perk fouls the weapon something fierce) and thinking ""well, time to head back toward Camp McCarran to find some suckers...er, soldiers...to kill for spare parts."""

ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,thirdtotheleft,2,Mon Apr 6 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, the perk ""And Stay Back!"" gives a 10% chance of knocking over an enemy PER PELLET. So, if you use a Pulse slug, even though it does more damage, you're better off using buckshot for a 70% chance of knockdown if you get in a direct confrontation.  Or you could start with buckshot and then quickly switch into other ammo/gun."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,thirdtotheleft,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"I used to think the same, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't calculate that way. The target has a 90% of NOT being knocked down per round, meaning that their odds of NOT being knocked down are .97 : 1. About 48%. So your odds of knock down, assuming all rounds hit, are actually about 52%.  If you use coin shot (8 projectiles instead of 7) and the Big Boomer (2 shells instead of 1), then that's about 81.5% knock down chance, the best available with shotguns."
ManyATrueNerd,31juoc,Dinosaur802,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:33:03 2015 UTC,I thought it was a flat multiplier but this appears to be the case instead. Weird.

The 12mm is better than the .45 you're using in every single way except for magazine size, which is offset by the 12mm's higher damage anyway, and ammo rarity, which shouldn't be an issue for you since you can stock up thanks to your wealth. You can even silence the 12mm SMG to give it extra utility in close quarters before being seen."

ManyATrueNerd,31ekw8,dabisnit,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:09:34 2015 UTC,I don't believe it does. I think you only have to be in bad reputation with them. I've never killed Moore and I remember them attacking my first play though.

ManyATrueNerd,31ekw8,Francois_Rapiste,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure they won't send hit squads at first, but all of the NCR will be instantly hostile and shoot you on sight unless you are disguised. But it has been a while since I played  New Vegas, so maybe i'm wrong about that."
ManyATrueNerd,31ekw8,Francois_Rapiste,2,Sat Apr 4 22:38:59 2015 UTC,"UPDATE, days later because stupid office job:  Nope.  Worst that can happen is NCR shoots you on sight, but they don't send hit squads.  Which is kind of a shame because they'd otherwise duke it out with the Legion hit squads, which in addition to thinning the herd to make it easier for the Courier to clean up the rest of the threat, also drops more loot and is seriously damn entertaining."

I'm a female, although not a teenager, and have stopped watching other channels I used to watch daily because they altered (dumbed down) their content/voiceovers with a lot of yelling and over the top theatrics to get younger viewers. Your channel is really refreshing in the sense that you don't need to yell to make an entertaining videos, it's more subtle humour and interesting gameplay (Fallout series especially) and probably why you're getting more viewers -- people sick of all the channels servicing childish garbage. Anyway, just my two cents. Always looking forward to more videos! (I thought the haul part of this video was really amusing - great stuff :)"

ManyATrueNerd,30n1vt,triangular_cube,5,Sat Mar 28 22:58:01 2015 UTC,"Spoilers, don't read until after watching the vid---  My assumption is that Clair had no idea about the shadow monsters, etc. and Rina had basically lied to her about everything that was going on, so Clair wouldn't worry, and that's why Clair said you had rejected both of them. Then, your character picked up on it and didn't tell Clair the truth, in order to protect Rina's secrets and to also help keep her happy."

ManyATrueNerd,30n1vt,QT_Luna,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:50:35 2015 UTC,I think so. You shouldn't have denied Mystica. I suppose the game expected you to see through her possible bluff (as the game stated it will lie to you). What a shame.

None of them send or accept mission invites or show any inclination to do anything crew related or even just chat. Any time I join someone's game they disconnect as soon as they see a crew member dot on the map like its a sign of the end times. To top it off I joined a mission lobby with a member who made fun of me for enjoying MATN before telling me to fuck off and kicking me.  I'm curious if its going any better on other platforms? I'm guessing since the he crew has over 200 members the majority must be on last gen, and therefore there's a better chance an actual community could form."
ManyATrueNerd,30e3fi,SolarMechanic,2,Fri Apr 3 11:53:44 2015 UTC,I'm on PS4 and play maybe twice a week. I live in Australia though so usually when I'm on most people in the crew are not. I see at most 5 at any one time.  I've not managed to successfully invite a crew member to any jobs yet either so I'm relying on randos at this point!

ManyATrueNerd,3073j8,Meowtwe,3,Wed Mar 25 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"Oh Jon, you magnificent, magnificent man you. Strongly disagree with your choice at the end though although I don't think I've ever seen you agonize over a choice like that. Even if she heard your ""I believe you"" as ""I will be a witness in court for you"" which isn't a thing except if she were a minor in some states, I still would've went with it. Because if you let her down gently, and she still goes to the police and nothing comes of it because of the video, lack of memory, etc, she will hear it as they don't believe her. And they have to tell her that because it's their job. You're her friend though so it's not really your place to tell her it won't hold up legally. By telling her to wait for proof, even if she went to the cops who told her the same thing, now you've left her with nobody who she's heard ""I believe you from"" instead of you remaining there to be the friend and shoulder to lean on when things fall apart legally for her. I hope I made sense to you. What a very ""in"" topic now, though, at least in the American college scene. I know it's just a video game, so maybe you will get the chance later to find evidence against all odds, just if it happens in real life, that's the reason I had to type this out."

ManyATrueNerd,3073j8,dabisnit,6,Wed Mar 25 01:52:56 2015 UTC,I think that was the point. A recurring theme in the Mass Effect series is that saving the galaxy has consequences. And sometimes those consequences are dead fish.

ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,Dblitzer,11,Sun Mar 22 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"I'd hazard a guess that Obsidian wanted to avoid the problem that Fallout 3's DLC had- you'd meet someone with really cool gear, and you'd want the gear, but then it would mean deciding if it was worth murdering them for it or not. Ashur in The Pitt and the samurai on Mothership Zeta especially come to mind.  This way, you get to have your cake and eat it too! Doesn't make a lot of sense, but the gesture is nice."

ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,Drokash,17,Sun Mar 22 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's robotics expert, since the majority of enemies in there are robots."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,WiggleTheStick,14,Sun Mar 22 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"Robotics Expert is a good decision, other than that it's close to useless without Silent Running, which Jon doesn't have yet. I'm pretty sure he knows how risky it is to try and deactivate Old World Blues robots without Silent Running.    I think another possible option is Chemist, because it increases stealthboy duration by twofold. And the dropboxes from Caesar's Favor should still be restocking and include large quantities of stealthboys because he at one point hit Idolized status with them.   Whichever perk he picked, the next one can't be anything other than Silent Running. It synergizes with both Chemist (for stealthboys) and Robotics Expert."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,Revelations216,6,Sun Mar 22 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"Robotics Expert would also really help on the Giant Roboscorpion fight, so that's my guess."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,thirdtotheleft,6,Sun Mar 22 22:12:33 2015 UTC,"I would like to know also. We can narrow it down a bit knowing it will be Old World Blues...so maybe a perk that is energy weapon based? I hope he didn't choose the perk that was on-screen when he was explaining that part (the one that reflects energy weapons damage if you wear sunglasses and metal armor), because that perk is broken and basically does nothing."

Old World Blues next though, eh?  It's been a good run, but I'm confident that Big MT will be the grave site of P. D. Shoot."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,NoOneImportant4,7,Sun Mar 22 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"I'm confident he'll beat OWB, but The Divide sounds like it'll be the place of his demise, either due to a deathclaw or a tunneler."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,thirdtotheleft,11,Sun Mar 22 22:14:58 2015 UTC,"Flare gun makes either flee, so neither of them is a serious threat. He also has Light Step, so the annoying satchel charges won't detonate.  That leaves the marked men as the only potentially serious threat. But they're similar to White Legs stats-wise, and we saw that Jon made easy work of the White Legs. They do use special ammo types though, like HP and AP rounds, and even incendiary rounds for the AMR, which will eat away at your health after the initial damage."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,Revelations216,4,Sun Mar 22 22:43:28 2015 UTC,He better hope he gets the flare gun before he sets off the missile! Otherwise the tunnelers on the downward elevator will be his doom.
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,Revelations216,5,Sun Mar 22 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"For sure! I found a flare gun before the elevator section, probably from one of the marked men, and basically used it as crowd control while on the elevator against the tunnelers. It was kind of funny, because they were running about the platform around me, all panicked, and when the elevator at last came to rest, the game set them to instantly die."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,dabisnit,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:31:27 2015 UTC,I killed the tunnlers without aiming with the explosive AMR. They are not easy to kill. I used like 5 shots in a tunnel

If Jon gets to LR, I'm close to certain he would do the same.   Yea, they can take multiple headshots from high powered rifles. I think I would have set them to have less health, honestly."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,NoOneImportant4,3,Mon Mar 23 13:50:27 2015 UTC,"I can't share your confidence.  If OWB doesn't kill PD Shoot, The Divide should.  I feel confident Jon can make it through Dead Money without dying though.  But only IF he lives through OWB.  Lonesome Road should definitely be the last DLC he tackles."

Not to mention is that he'd have to do all the radio and hologram sections perfectly, which would be an absolute bitch, especially as Jon isn't that familiar with the DLCs."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,mlucassmith,7,Mon Mar 23 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"I hope he does the divide before dead money, simply because I think he can make it through the divide but dead money is a guaranteed graveyard."
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,FinalFate,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:39:23 2015 UTC,I don't see him beating OWB.  Too many scripted robo-scorpion ambushes.
ManyATrueNerd,2zxqwy,Revelations216,2,Mon Mar 23 11:01:37 2015 UTC,"They ambush you in the main questline close to every time you backtrack to a previous cell. But this can be solved by just activating a stealthboy before exiting the current cell, and upon arrival to the previous cell, you will be cloaked and undetectable (just don't accidentally fire your weapon or bump into them).   The concern is real though. They do like a whopping 70-80 damage per hit, and that's without a critical. I think OWB should still be manageable for this playthrough, but it's going to be more difficult than HH of course. LR should be around the same level of difficulty as OWB, maybe easier (mainly because of flare gun). DM is the trickiest and most difficult of them all. The radios aren't the real threat when you know each one's position. The holograms are a little more unpredictable, but not too much. I think it'll be the ghost people that will be a pain, specifically the spear-throwing ones."

ManyATrueNerd,2zygoc,wearegrewt,2,Sun Mar 22 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"I considered it, but killing everyone just for my own entertainment ain't fun (in my opinion). Not killing anyone would be a challenge, but extremely annoying, cause of some mods I'm running. And YOLO is ""impossible"", if you run mods that cause stuff to respawn and increase spawns, rebalance parts of the stats and so on.  I usually give myself my own crazy rulesets. E.g: The ""I can't hear you, but you will hear me""-Run Rules: - no sneaking (no checking if hidden, no stealth attack criticals) - if you see objects that can be destroyed, you have to destroy it (eplosive world objects, quest objectives (Vaults, BoS, etc), traps [mines have to be shot/detonated and grenades have to be triggered, or they won't get destroyed], neatly organised items [e.g. the bottles pyramids] have to get knocked over) - no silencers or silent weapons. It has to go ""Boom!"" or ""Bang!""    Fun but requires more ammo than usually, blocks some of the better weapons (CoS Sniper Rifle or Ratslayer, most energy weapons also don't go ""Boom!"" or ""Bang!"") and with some other restrictions (e.g. only heal in a bar or casino) pretty hard to impossible.  tl;dr: It's more fun to think of a personal ruleset."

For example, if you go to the monestary where you had to save the statues and throw bait, you get either Bears, Tigers, Dholes, Clouded Leopards, or Snow Leopards. I think it's completely random, as I stood there for half an hour doing your infinite bait method and there were no snow leopards for about 10 minutes, then I got a string of like 6 back to back.  Also, you missed the sniper. It's way stronger than the predator and you can get all the same upgrades, but now it won't be available till you head north"

ManyATrueNerd,2zhlbw,Asev,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can be really hard to determine when a web series is in decline. Because so often we become fans of things on Youtube by the very fact that it feels fresh or provides a new experience. Which quite frankly can never last, unless the content provider completely changes their formula which can invoke entirely new problems.  I personally went through that with Game Grumps, they were the first real LP channel that I watched on a consistent basis. Probably because they came off as more improv comedy and self-aware of being an LP than anything I had watched at the time. Plus it was one of the first web series I subscribed to that consistently released videos on a daily basis.   But eventually, with that constant stream of content. That style becomes no more unique than any other LP on Youtube. I also really got into the LP's of Northernlion, Arumba and Mathas. Who release so much content on a daily basis, it makes the Game Grumps release schedule look paltry in comparison.  I of course personally feel that the Game Grumps have been in decline for awhile, and barely watch new episodes. But it's so hard to remove my own personal reasons for liking it in the first place from any sense of ""quality"" that my impressions are really of no value to anyone but myself."

Let all the tribes that have been there for so long keep doing what they're doing. The legion was scary, and while the NCR is generally ""good"", There's a logistical issue for them properly holding and defending the Mojave, plus no one seemed to want to be part of the NCR. Plus I thought House was definitely planning a betrayal, so instead I betrayed him. I also still liked the BoS from 3 and thought they deserved a chance. Plus the Followers seemed the most paragon and they didn't want anyone taking over.  It's a bit sad because the independent Vegas through Yes Man is highly unsatisfying to play as.

ManyATrueNerd,2yfdo4,EugenesCure,7,Tue Mar 10 17:57:09 2015 UTC,The only reason I have completed Fallout 3 and New Vegas is because I watched the first videos from the kill everything run of Fallout 3. I rarely play RPGs and even though I wanted to like the games so badly I just could not get the grip on them. I kept dying and couldn't find out why. Then I saw this maniac running around in the same areas I got my ass handed to me in wielding a bat and killing people on one if the higher difficulties. I decided to try again since it was obviously possible. I read a bit about different builds and leaned on the experiences I had from playing D&D with friends (which is the most fun btw) and suddenly I finally got it. I ended up loving both games and after that I started out with Skyrim again. So I owe Jon many thanks for showing me that I could complete Fallout 3.

The first game I got on Steam was BioShock: Infinite and as a new PC gamer I couldn't get the hang of it. However, after I got Fallout: New Vegas I had an opportunity to slowly break into learning how to aim because I could rely on V.A.T.S. and had the freedom of the open world to escape to if I got overwhelmed with the major quest lines. I wouldn't have moved beyond indie games without it."

I have always run into at least one at that camp site,  I hope you plan on getting the Survivalists Rifle. It might be a little bit of unnecessary risk to get there, but the gun is definitely worth it. With proper perks, it can achieve the highest non-critical single shot/dps of any gun in the game.

However, shortly after MATN deals with the Rad Scorp on screen, he does say, ""I thought I dealt with the Rad Scorpions around here"" - Implying there was another, which is likely the one I pointed out in the background at 3:15. Maybe you're right and there was one other Rad Scorp he missed."
ManyATrueNerd,2ydddq,acksed,5,Mon Mar 9 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason you don't look stimpacks, Jon? I know you aren't going to use them, but they're weightless, and worth a pretty penny.  As for shotguns, I can understand not wanting to try something new on a playthough with stakes like this, but next time you run through FNV (kill everything?) I very very highly recommend trying them. They're not that great early game, but later on they're incredibly lethal, and in particular would do nicely on this run.  The riot shotgun, before perks, does the same DPS as your 45 auto SMG, which isn't too bad. Unlike the SMGs, however, the perk And Stay Back gives shotguns a 10% chance to knockdown per pellet which means that when you're using a riot shotgun with standard ammo you have a 70% knockdown chance per shot, and shoot four times per second. Even deathclaws can't withstand that, because although their DT is higher than the damage you're dealing, anything you shoot is effectively going to be on the floor until it dies. If you add shotgun surgeon in, just about anything with less armor than an NCR trooper has no DT.   If that's not enough to convince you, there's also the huge number of ammo types available, which do everything from silencing the gun to KO damage to incendiary effects."

ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,ManyATrueNerd,17,Sat Mar 7 20:46:27 2015 UTC,"Once I figured out what the game was doing with the newspapers, I had a lightbulb moment---the use of multiple threads that don't connect until the climax is a classic film noir trope.  Since the game was bounded by gameplay conventions and didn't want to give too much away to the player/confuse perspective by making the player play as, say, Courtney Sheldon, it chose newspaper cutscenes to tell that thread of the story (note that the game didn't bring Jack Kelso in as playable until very late in the game when the devs knew the players would be comfortable with having a second playable character brought in.)  There's a lot of talk in the gaming press about ""when will gaming get its Citizen Kane?""  Gaming doesn't need that---gaming needs its Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction was the first movie that drove its storytelling entirely by expecting its audience to know the tropes of film and not have to gearshift their brain.  LA Noire tried to do that with the tropes of game design and came as close as any game has to succeeding so far."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,RealFoxD,6,Sat Mar 7 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of talk in the gaming press about ""when will gaming get its Citizen Kane?"" Gaming doesn't need that---gaming needs its Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was the first movie that drove its storytelling entirely by expecting its audience to know the tropes of film and not have to gearshift their brain   I guess the problem for gaming though........ is Pulp Fiction came years after film had gotten past its struggles with being accepted as more than a mere hobby. Whereas gaming is just getting to the point where its intelligentsia has finally completely broken with idea that gaming somehow needs to stand on the crutch of other medium's formalized rubrics of ""artistic"" expectations. I'm not sure it's really gotten to the point where the majority of people are ready to finally stop thinking in terms of the very institutionalized literary and film backgrounds  Which isn't to say that gaming is completely lacking in this category. I thought that Stanley Parable did a wonderful job of commentating on the gulf and struggle between player defined choice and developer/storyteller driven narrative. But that doesn't really have the same mass appeal I suppose."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,Dblitzer,2,Sun Mar 8 11:30:14 2015 UTC,"One reason I mentioned gaming doesn't need its Citizen Kane is that gaming's already had that for 20 years---Final Fantasy VI is gaming's Citizen Kane, a masterpiece of art, but one that uses the storytelling conventions of other, more established media (film and literature in FF6's case, literature and the stage in Kane's.)  It's nice to see that gaming's able to grow and mature as a medium this quickly (in relative terms)---it's only been about thirty years since gaming became a true thing with the popularity of the NES.  Film had been around for nearly a century before Tarantino and others like him were able to push that boundary successfully.  Indie games are a lot like narrow-release indie films---sure, they're the avant garde, but the bulk of the audience isn't going to be experiencing them.  I admit I haven't played Stanley Parable...but that's just it.  Like you said, no mass appeal."

ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,HongManChoi,4,Sat Mar 7 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit disappointed that you're not going to do the DLCs.  They're some of the best, most intriguing cases in the game.  While they take place during the story, they're separate and much more ""find the clues and figure out what happened"" oriented."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,TheProudBrit,3,Sun Mar 8 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"One thing I loved about this was that it was a noire game, just... Not for the most part. Not 'til it focused on Kelso. I mean, a broad showing up with a mystery she wants him to investigate? Someone from his past appearing, related to the woman? A bittersweet ending, with nobody quite winning? I always loved that about this game."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,kolboldbard,3,Sat Mar 7 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"Sweet LA, I gave my broken soul to yoouuu...."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,SolarMechanic,3,Sat Mar 7 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"Now that L.A. Noire is done I'm curious if Jon is at all curious about the spiritual sequel ""Whore of the Orient""?   It's set in 1936 Shanghai and will apparently be very similar to Noire in how it tells it's story, they're even using the same face-scan tech.  Reportedly it's due this year but that's more than likely gonna slip, the studio's been having a lot of problems since Noire shipped so I'd expect 2016."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,dabisnit,2,Sun Mar 8 19:01:10 2015 UTC,The water effects in the fountain were awesome
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,Jedizora,2,Sun Mar 8 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"I've loved this series, gonna be sad to see it go. Are you going to do the DLC? I heard most of it is really well done."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,Succubus_Kyuba,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:30:55 2015 UTC,I believe he said he'll be moving on to Resident Evil 6 and will not be doing the DLC cases.
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,Dropping_fruits,3,Sun Mar 8 19:56:03 2015 UTC,I would really like to see you play the DLC.

ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,PantsBonanza,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:35:00 2015 UTC,I actually noticed that in the editing. Not sure quite why...
ManyATrueNerd,2y9tqb,iiRockpuppy,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is that he's secretly a robot sent from the future to clean up the streets of LA in the past to avoid the supercrime-plagued in the far off year 2000.  Hopefully LA Noire gets a sequel that instead of being set up like a noir film, we get a cheesy 40s/50s sci-fi film. I'm all for this."

ManyATrueNerd,2y9mrl,Ramza424sb,9,Sat Mar 7 19:43:12 2015 UTC,how are we supposed to judge the challenge without knowing the rules?
ManyATrueNerd,2y9mrl,Vladnim,5,Sat Mar 7 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it's a generic ""good morality"" run (always accept surrenders, if there's a ""we could ambush this"" event run away instead, help the underdog, hand out supplies etc.) Would actually work as a one-off."
ManyATrueNerd,2y9mrl,BalefirePhoenix,7,Sat Mar 7 22:34:05 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more along the lines of No Pausing, or No Eyes. (Coop run with Claire, with only her being allowed to see the screen.)"
ManyATrueNerd,2y9mrl,forgodandthequeen,3,Sun Mar 8 11:41:46 2015 UTC,I do get alerts and check the suggestions thread regularly - don't worry about that.

I struggled for ages between the two leaders at first, but decided to go with the idealistic theocratic weirdo over the heroin-peddling pragmatist in the end. I'm glad you're going the other way so that I can see how both revolutions turn out!  Remember though, all of the bad things you're learning about Sabal are coming from his chief rival in a major power struggle and should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm sure neither one is as bad as the other makes them out to be."

ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,ManyATrueNerd,8,Wed Mar 4 14:41:22 2015 UTC,Honestly assuming you have high sneak in Dead Money it's scary but fine.   Old World Blues and The Lonesome Road... Yeah not so much.
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,Aduckonquack97,12,Wed Mar 4 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"I'm still mapping out my remaining perks per DLC - not 100% sure on what to prioritise most for Dead Money - silent running, I guess?"
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,ManyATrueNerd,5,Wed Mar 4 15:22:02 2015 UTC,I'm just glad you're not on hardcore mode.  That constant health drain would make your run impossible.
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,paleoreef103,6,Wed Mar 4 17:39:49 2015 UTC,Tunnel runner + silent running + travel light.
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,bolsey,3,Wed Mar 4 19:24:25 2015 UTC,Upvote for this.....those are the best perks for dead money.  Ghost people don't seem that perceptive.

ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,ManyATrueNerd,3,Wed Mar 4 16:19:39 2015 UTC,You probably can't afford to get hit even with good armour so you might be able to wear a radiation suit.

I hope you don't assume it'll be easy though and carelessly take a .45 sub-machinegun to the face. It's really easy until it isn't and then you take 300 damage from a white-leg .45 sub (power armor helps)"
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,carl1984,5,Wed Mar 4 16:50:32 2015 UTC,"The submachineguns don't worry me - with my DT, even a short burst would be very light damage. It's the gits with the anti-materiel rifles I'm worried about..."
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,ManyATrueNerd,7,Wed Mar 4 17:02:50 2015 UTC,And the surprise cazadores. And the drop bears Yao Guai that come out of nowhere.
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,hells_cowbells,2,Thu Mar 5 00:18:58 2015 UTC,"I had 40 DT and they did 300 damage, I think they were using AP ammo or the damage was enough. The .45 sub does I think 45 base so it can go over DT and 20% is still 9 damage per shot. Riot shotguns were also bad, anti-mat didn't hit me once which might just be luck"
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,carl1984,3,Wed Mar 4 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"Huh, for some reason I always thought the NPCs never used special ammo, but I may well be wrong there"

ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,RealFoxD,8,Sun Mar 8 21:13:06 2015 UTC,I think Honest Hearts and potentially even Old World Blues will be fine. What scares me is (I think) Jon said he's never played Dead Money and the damn radios in that could end it so fast
ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,TheRealMe99,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel that with how careful Jon has been he could easily complete Dead Money as long as he is cautious enough about traps.

ManyATrueNerd,2xwo0c,LordAshur,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:27:22 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just me but Lonesome road is so predictable. I know where every enemy stands/spawns at which makes it easy to clear (don't know how bad the rads are as I always had capped rad res)

And, oh, Mass Effect 2 - that music."
ManyATrueNerd,2xsrlf,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:08:38 2015 UTC,"See I fell in love with Fallout the moment I left the vault.  But in hindsight I struggle to play FO3 because it just doesn't give me the flexibility or choice there is in New Vegas. FO3 makes you choose between being good or evil which isn't a choice to me. But New Vegas lets you pick from many different options, all of which can be considered good to some degree."

I had no idea how to play an open-world game. I kept yelling, ""What do I do?"". I found Megaton but hit a patron or something and the whole town turned on me. I escaped and just ran. And ran. And ran. ""Did I glitch the game? Where's the end of the world?"" Then I got killed in the raider's supermarket. I quit and didn't play it again for two whole years."

ManyATrueNerd,2xsrlf,IJerkToEverything,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:47:17 2015 UTC,I think that's quite common.  The first time I played FO3 I completely missed the map marker and wandered off in a random direction with nothing but desolation around me.  Very soon I wandered into a bunch of raiders with a flamer who roasted my character alive. It took me a few hours to pick the game back up as I was too nervous to try it again.

ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,21,Mon Mar 2 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"She actually is - she follows us, and she'd watched plenty of the videos.  The level of coverage this last week has been very flattering - I reckon it's mutually beneficial - the articles do well for Kotaku (or seem to - if you check Kotaku's Twitter, these stories seem to get way more retweets, and the Fallout 3 Kill Everything write-up last year ended up in Kotaku's top 100 articles of the year), and the exposure's good for us, so win-win :)"
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,Pepperyfish,10,Mon Mar 2 23:24:34 2015 UTC,I really hope Jon gets really big because he deserves it. Although I will miss all the community interaction and stuff he can do now that big channels really can't.
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,21,Mon Mar 2 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"I'd hate to lose that good stuff - though at the very least, you'd be able to say you were here before it was cool."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,LoverOfLed,11,Mon Mar 2 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"Back in my day, I was waiting for the 7th episode of FNV Kill Everything!"
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,17,Tue Mar 3 00:24:10 2015 UTC,Back in the day when that series was every other week - you kids today don't know how lucky you've got it!
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,LoverOfLed,5,Tue Mar 3 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Man, I had forgotten that you did it every other week. That was over a year and half ago wasn't it?  Edit: A word"
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,5,Tue Mar 3 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, started August 2013"
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,LoverOfLed,3,Tue Mar 3 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"You started to put videos out on a weekly basis with FO3, correct? Because I seem to remember being quite excited about that, though I could be wrong."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,2,Tue Mar 3 00:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's right - though it may have been slightly earlier..."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,LoverOfLed,7,Tue Mar 3 00:48:15 2015 UTC,"Jon, I have to say, your interaction with your fans is astounding. The care that you put into your videos, and thought you give to the community/fans is the reason you have become my favorite channel on Youtube, over Rooster Teeth, Vsauce, SmarterEveryDay, and all of the others that I'm subscribed to.  Thank you for maintaining your quality performance, and your quality attitude. My only request when you get big is that you remember the fans that were with you in the beginning. Also Mass Effect 2: No guns  Edit: Also thank you for introducing me to Mass Effect, if it hadn't been for you I wouldn't have picked up what quickly became my favorite story-line of all time."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,5,Tue Mar 3 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"Aww, Mass Effect - such an awesome story. So well put together."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,Jak2Rich,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"Hey Jon, do you work, and if you do then how much time do you put into the videos including editing? Your editing is excellent and it must take up a Huge chunk of your time doing these videos."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,3,Tue Mar 3 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yes - I work full-time, and pretty long hours too. I'd have to guess that I spend at least 10 hours per week working on the videos, but then there's other bits and pieces (like leaving enough time to go through the YouTube Analytics, and just making sure I've got time to come chat with the communit here) - yeah, it is pretty much a part time job on top of my full-time one."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,Mizzonn,12,Tue Mar 3 10:01:01 2015 UTC,"The exposure is great, but that article is just awful; literally just acting as a full plot synopsis of the video. Kotaku reads like the blog of a thirteen year-old :/"
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,raptor_theo,9,Mon Mar 2 22:02:21 2015 UTC,That's Kotaku. They did the exact same to my video.
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,forgodandthequeen,2,Mon Mar 2 23:25:00 2015 UTC,Chugga Chugga hype train!
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,SuffolksSecretSauce,2,Mon Mar 2 21:43:11 2015 UTC,F-yeah. Any more press is good press. Jon... High five. You deserve what's coming bud.
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,dabisnit,6,Mon Mar 2 22:46:51 2015 UTC,"Any more press is good press.   Tonight at 5, local Brit arrested for triple homicide and a lewd act with a garden gnome. Find out how his rise in fame online where he killed everyone in Fallout, lead to his breaking point."
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,ManyATrueNerd,17,Tue Mar 3 00:05:45 2015 UTC,A German newspaper once actually called me a 'roleplay crackpot' - it was great.
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,hells_cowbells,5,Tue Mar 3 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, you are still our favorite roleplay crackpot!"
ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,Yogurt_Huevos,2,Tue Mar 3 12:12:54 2015 UTC,translation issue or was it literally what it meant?  I know that German to English isn't always isomorphic.

ManyATrueNerd,2xpkdb,robblatt,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:19:37 2015 UTC,I'm here because of that article! Ran through You Only Live Once in a few days. My new favorite channel.
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,ManyATrueNerd,23,Sun Mar 1 20:14:59 2015 UTC,Jed's eyes...  Doubt!
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,bolsey,19,Sun Mar 1 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"The AM rifle shouldn't really have hollow point ammo, given it is designed to take down tanks."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,forgodandthequeen,7,Sun Mar 1 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"""Anti material"" translates to ""hard targets"". And hollow point ammo only works on soft and squishy targets, that is the point of it.  On the other side, the .50BMG has so much energy it does not matter if it is a HP or TFMJ bullet. The soft tissue cavitation will see no difference at all.  Source: I shoot guns... a lot :)"
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,TOHSNBN,7,Mon Mar 2 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"Here's how I'd write the lore article for that if it were on me to do so:  ""In the lead-up to the Great War, the American and Chinese militaries ran out of armour plating to make tanks, so they started making them out of squishier materials.  This necessitated a change of tactics in anti-tank warfare, leading to the development of the .50 MG hollow-point round by West Tek in early 2077.  The round never saw wide action in combat because of the bombs falling, but hollow-point .50 MG rounds can be found in relative abundance in areas around southern California near the original West Tek production facility."""
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,RealFoxD,18,Mon Mar 2 00:04:59 2015 UTC,"Follows Chalk's and Waking Cloud's sidequests don't require any combat to complete. They're both done entirely through dialogue, so I don't think it would inconvenience you to do them.   Rite of Passage, the one where you fight Ghost of She, is also quite easy, because you can trigger her to spawn while hidden, then one shot her with Pacencia, preferrably.   Keep an eye out for cazadores, especially the giant ones like you mentioned, because they can spawn close to you at many areas in Zion.  The White Legs shouldn't be too much of a problem, because the worldspace is open. They will be most dangerous at Three Marys, which provides good over, but is very enclosed.   I think if you go back to the Mojave (after completing Honest Hearts, of course), the supply drops from the Caesar's Favor quest will still occur, even though the quest itself doesn't trigger. Because you got to Idolized status with the Legion, stealthboys should be part of the drops.  EDIT: I forgot to mention the COMPLIANCE REGULATOR. Things just got much easier."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Revelations216,8,Sun Mar 1 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"45 minutes, after an hour long episode last week? Jon, you're too good to us."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Bookworm12k,9,Sun Mar 1 20:22:14 2015 UTC,Dis gun b gud. I'm hoping Jon makes it to Dead Money. That is when shit hits the fan.
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,1kingdomheart,3,Sun Mar 1 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"Sure Jon can make it through HH. Tribals dont like anti-tank rifles. LR, OWB, and DM are going to be a whole different story. If he can make it through just one of those, I'll be even more impressed."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,dchew202,8,Mon Mar 2 01:49:00 2015 UTC,"This was a great episode. Long-time fans seem to enjoy the game discussion in your videos, and so I would mostly ignore the youtube comments. The more followers and fans of the series, the ruder the comments get. Just do what you enjoy and it'll be successful."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,paperandcloth,17,Sun Mar 1 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"The DLC represents a big challenge;  i.) Lots of people have never played it before, so I want to keep more of the story and game than I would do otherwise. ii.) Other people are used to very tightly edited videos. iii.) The DLC are generally densely populated with enemies, so there's less dead time to cut out (and if I did cut out minor encounters, some people got annoyed I'm cutting out risks)  I'm trying to balance that, but I suspect some people will be annoyed, so I look forward to the lovely 'You're not as good as you used to be' comments. Ah well."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,LoverOfLed,2,Sun Mar 1 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to them when they do start coming. I've been with you since early on in your FNV Kill Everything run, and I have only seen growth from there."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,PigHaggerty,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:33:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I know you probably wouldn't want to, but part of me thinks that, if it were me, I'd consider just disabling YouTube comments. The comments on any video that gets any amount of attention are just the WORST.  I feel like your true community is on here, and the interactions on this subreddit always seem positive and constructive. I'm biased as someone who knows you from reddit though, I imagine you have plenty of fans who know you through YouTube and it would alienate them. I just find the comments sections of popular YT videos become so ghastly. At any rate, don't let anything change your fantastic style and don't get dragged into any flame wars over religion or whatever! :)  By the way, was that White Leg the first one to actually shoot P.D. Shoot? (Other than the rigged shotgun of course.)"
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Dynamesmouse,2,Wed Mar 4 04:45:15 2015 UTC,"I can understand the position of people who disable comments - the odd spot of negativity can bother me a lot more than it should. But overwhelmingly, they're good, and I do read all of them.  Ok, so, dog bite, dynamite, ghoul attack, bear trap, shotgun trap, mantis swipe... Possibly, I'll need to go and check in case I'm forgetting something..."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,TheProudBrit,2,Wed Mar 4 10:16:33 2015 UTC,"Oh wait - the Legion got in one shot at Bittersprings, and a Brotherhood scribe hit me once with a laser pistol in the Bunker"
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Hamdingers_Cat,6,Wed Mar 4 11:28:08 2015 UTC,"Jed: Howdy, friend. Heard my little broadcast, did you? Yeah, you look the type.  I don't think Please don't shoot was wearing any clothes at that moment. I didn't know Honest Hearts was that sort of DLC.  Edit: She wasn't wearing any clothes for an entire week. Lol  By the way, can you rotate your camera around more often. It's just something that bothers me when you avoid looking at your character's face."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Jethro_McCrazy,4,Mon Mar 2 08:25:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, looks like only /u/hamdingers_cat got the gun right."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Jethro_McCrazy,7,Sun Mar 1 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"With as much trigger time Ratslayer got, I had a feeling that we'd be seeing Paciencia sooner or later. P.D. Shoot likes a good critical.  Paciencia flies under the radar most of the time. It's not a really fancy-looking gun compared to things like the AM Rifle, Marksman Carbine, or the unique sniper variants, and unless you actually buy it and try it (or read up on its stats beforehand), the numbers are on it look quite underwhelming. With a few perks (Finesse, Better Criticals, Rapid Reload) however, it turns into a pretty amazing tool for killing, even at higher levels."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Revelations216,4,Mon Mar 2 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"Did you mine Ricky for exp off camera, or did you not know about it? When you talk to him, he'll tell long winded (false) stories, and you can earn exp pointing out flaws in what he is saying. Unless you already did it, I think you missed out on some decent exp by immediately saying you were going to Jed."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Revelations216,9,Sun Mar 1 22:20:13 2015 UTC,I estimated that I'd spent enough time preparing - and even then I've had some comments complaining there wasn't enough action in the episode.  I also kind of want to avoid XP mining for its own sake - being over levelled in OWB is a death sentence...
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Maschinengewehr,6,Sun Mar 1 22:24:16 2015 UTC,I maintain that OWB is a death sentence anyway.
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,BairaagiVN,5,Mon Mar 2 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"Jon will need a replenishing source of stealthboys for OWB, which is why I recommended to him the repeatable Caesar's Favor quest, the loot from which restocks even after you've gained negative reputation with them.   Only then, will he have a good chance of completing it. The roboscorpions that ambush you when you exit the testing facilities can only be gotten past by activating a stealthboy before exiting the respective facilities. The close quarters of the facilities themselves make sneaking difficult, so stealthboys will be needed frequently for traversing them. Silent Running is also a must-have before Jon heads to OWB. I think he'll pick it the next time he levels up, which will put him at Level 26.   Stealthboys, and more stealthboys - that's the only way he'll complete OWB. The only reliable supply that exists is from the Caesar's Legion supply drop."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Dblitzer,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:07:14 2015 UTC,Very likely...
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Revelations216,2,Mon Mar 2 09:30:35 2015 UTC,"Have to be stealthboyed up pretty much through the entirety of the interior sections, and have Silent Running at least. I've tried other methods, but this is the only one that works if you want to go unscathed."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Maschinengewehr,5,Mon Mar 2 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"I think the hybrid language might be supposed to have some German/Dutch influence, because in German ""suchen""(and ""zoeken"" in Dutch) is ""to search/seek,"" also ""Ausländer"" means ""foreigner"" in German.  I don't really know why it would be a Dutch/German and English hybrid, but it's sort of cool. There's probably some information about it somewhere online. I don't remember what the language sounded like on the German version of Fallout NV, maybe it was also a German + English hybrid, but with 1 or 2 English-like words instead"
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Daveaa005,7,Sun Mar 1 23:16:33 2015 UTC,"According to the wiki they're all descended from a batch of tourists who happened to be vacationing in the park at the time.  So there are hybrids English/German, English/Spanish, and all 3.  Personally I think it would've made more sense to use a language like Navajo rather than German."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,technotoad1,6,Sun Mar 1 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"Hybrid English/German/Spanish, but using flowery ""Native American names"" like ""Follows Chalk"" and ""Walking Cloud""  I've always found the tribes of Zion to be pretty non-sensical canon wise. As it seems they wrote them to be a tribal stereotype, then attempted to make them fit into Fallout New Vegas. It's a bit lazy and not fleshed out the greatest tbh."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,technotoad1,3,Mon Mar 2 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"I always found the primitive tribal idea to be non-sensical, beginning with Fallout 2."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,_JackDoe_,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, but fallout tried to be a bit crazy with stuff"
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,serialphreak,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"Came here to say the same thing. When I heard ""ows lander"" I just assumed they were saying ""Ausländer"" until I saw how they spelled it. Nothing else seems to be German... but that definitely is."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,serialphreak,2,Mon Mar 2 01:52:47 2015 UTC,I don't know if it was explained at any point but can anyone elaborate as to why Jon didn't just do the DLC than the Dam?
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,tapeman111,6,Mon Mar 2 05:24:20 2015 UTC,Because the DLC is much harder than the Dam - it would feel odd to do vastly harder stuff before the Dam...
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,dabisnit,1 point,Mon Mar 2 09:27:26 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense.
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Kittenclysm,2,Mon Mar 2 09:28:44 2015 UTC,"You know what, I've said 'dude no fucking way you're going to pull that off' at least five times during the base game. Every single time I've been proven wrong. Good luck Jon, have fun in Dead Money. You can do anything."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,acksed,2,Mon Mar 2 18:49:44 2015 UTC,"Is the Medicine Stick not a better gun than the one you bought? I understand that you Bought it to carry .308 but 45-70 also has a hollow point as far as I know and the medicine stick is higher DPS and DMG and holds more than 3 rounds. If I'm wrong and the gun you chose was better, I know you could get an extended mag for the hunting rifle from the vendetron, increasing its mag size to 8. Not critizing your decision I love your play through because they are much different than my own. I'm just trying to understand this decision more clearly. Can't wait for next week I wait all week for the yolo run it is awesome!"
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,Kittenclysm,8,Mon Mar 2 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"The Medicine Stick's base damage is better (it's about 78, I think) - but Paciencia's base damage (55) doubles if you get a critical hit, making it 110. Even with cowboy perk, Medicine Stick is 97.5, so lower - and that's before the higher cost & rarity of its ammo is factored in - paciencia is more powerful and cheaper and easier to keep full of ammo."
ManyATrueNerd,2xlbtm,dabisnit,3,Mon Mar 2 09:30:22 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I wont be wasting money on the medicine stick any longer."

It's a decently big-looking pile, if you had realistic carrying capacity for money.    It also interested me that (for me at least) 25 caps is basically just a large handful. Maybe that's the real in-universe criteria: you're paid one handful fistful of caps."

ManyATrueNerd,2xkwzy,LutrianH,6,Sun Mar 1 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, what's your beef with butterfree? Early game, it's crazy. Poison powder, sleep power, confusion and gust. Sure, I can't imagine using it past level 30ish, but until then it's great."
ManyATrueNerd,2xkwzy,LutrianH,5,Sun Mar 1 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong - if you picked Charmander, and it was original red/blue, so nobody wussed out and gave you Nidorans with double kick or Mankeys with low kick, then getting Butterfree to Level 12 for confusion was your best bet.  But once you cleared Mt Moon and bellsprout/oddish became available, butterfree is just utterly pointless. They could have given it something to make it workable mid-game..."
ManyATrueNerd,2xkwzy,LutrianH,3,Sun Mar 1 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that always annoyed me. To be honest, I always made it a point to beat Brock with just Charmander, just for a nice early 'fuck you' to the game."

ManyATrueNerd,2xktt3,QT_Luna,3,Sun Mar 1 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"Lonesome road he can bring supplies/stealthboys and make it through safely.  Honest Hearts won't be hard but he might take some damage on white legs since he won't be using walking clouds companion perk.   OWB will be crazy because of (nightstalkers, robo-dogs/brains/scorpions, lobotomites) so that might finish him off or get him below 100hp. I would probably bring a massive arsenal of mines for OWB, because clearing out the area is easy with sneak but you always get ambushed when you try to leave.  Dead Money will kill him 99.999997% sure, only chance he has is if the game bugs out"

ManyATrueNerd,2xeqwd,dabisnit,-2,Sat Feb 28 03:24:48 2015 UTC,I thought you were unnecessarily dismissive this episode Jon. There might not have been the same gameplay as the rest of the game but there was a lot of exposition and Karat history you experienced.    It might have even explained a bit more as to why your father was the way he was given that you put the thanka back in his house. Might you be literally following in his footsteps and repeating history? Are you now following manifest destiny or are you the one making the choices?   There's nothing in this game that isn't without relevance. It's not all about boom boom and wingsuits. I think you were just having a bad day. You seemed a bit grumpy.

So, yeah, I just stumbled across it really. It doesn't mean anything, I suppose - but it also means an awful lot of things too :)"

ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,RealFoxD,3,Sun Feb 22 23:58:35 2015 UTC,I love that game :)  Maybe I like Medieval II sliiiightly more...
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,RealFoxD,3,Mon Feb 23 00:01:44 2015 UTC,"Medieval II is better-balanced, but the gameplay never felt as tight to me in the battles.  Horses in particular have a much more jerky animation in Medieval II than they did in Rome, something you start to notice in a hurry when part of your strategy involves keeping light cavalry around for no better reason than to run down retreating enemies.  (Rome is #2 on my all-time list of favourite games, trailing only New Vegas.)"
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Mr_Beige,7,Mon Feb 23 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothered me about Medieval II was that it felt largely pointless assaulting cities with anything other than equipment to destroy the walls. Towers/ladders etc I never used, because when they were on the walls, crappy inexperienced militia in defence mysteriously held their nerve, and vastly superior attacking infantry got slaughtered by low level towers eventually.  In the end, I never assaulted unless I had ballistae/trebuchets/cannons, which was sad, because wall and city street fights were awesome in Rome."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Mr_Beige,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"I never went in much for siege assaults, always preferring to wait out the opponent and let them come to me if they didn't want to go quietly.

ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Lolita_Humbert,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"The main issue I had with Medieval was the homogenous factions.   Every faction felt basically identical, being divided into just a few categories. The Scots felt a bit different to the rest of the European factions, the Islamic Factions were certainly different, and the Mongols were super OP, but I felt like so much of the game was just skirmishing with identical factions.  Mechanically though, I felt Medieval II was by and away superior. I bet you could do themed runs too, like always obeying the Pope, or perhaps Evil Jon got sent back in time and now runs Medieval Britain, so you always execute all prisoners and raze every city."

Pushing back full three stack armies from heavily defended castles was awesome."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Slavin92,5,Mon Feb 23 22:00:39 2015 UTC,When you get that PS4 you should play Ryse: Son of Rome as a part of Why Not Wednesday. It'd be absolutely hilarious.

I never checked before the end of the video to see if you lost health, so I was on the edge of my seat. When you began talking about the legion ambush in Lanius' camp, I thought for a second you were actually gonna fight the bastard! But that's only because I have far too many hours in this game and knew the backup wouldn't attack if Lanius didn't, haha.  Anyway, great job, man! A question regarding Honest Hearts though, are you going to go for getting all the Father in the Cave's logs, or just for his armor and rifle? Or other sidequests like the spirit Yao Guai? Just curious how far you're gonna go with Zion since you can get through the main storyline in almost no time at all if you rush it. Thanks again!"

ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Kittenclysm,2,Sun Feb 22 21:26:18 2015 UTC,The Father in the Caves doesn't have armor. has garbage armor. Possibly you're thinking of Graham's armor?
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,carl1984,5,Sun Feb 22 21:24:03 2015 UTC,He's referring to the Survivalist's Armor which belonged to Randall Clark. Can find it in a cave in the Sorrows' camp.
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Kittenclysm,4,Sun Feb 22 21:39:13 2015 UTC,Desert Ranger Combat Armor. I see. I guess I didn't pay it much attention because it's another one of those ranger armors with a slightly different color.    What I'm wondering now is why P.D. Shoot would benefit from having such mediocre armor.
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,theflyingcheese,11,Sun Feb 22 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"If you go the medium-armour route in a playthrough, that stuff's actually very useful (its DT of 22 is two points higher than the 20 you get from Combat Armour, Mark II in the basegame, making it only slightly less powerful than Power Armour but without as dire a speed or stealth penalty.  It's actually a good balance.)"
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,forgodandthequeen,2,Mon Feb 23 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you there. It's an armour which exists for those wanting something a bit more unique. In terms of a YOLO run, there are better choices out there."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,RealFoxD,2,Sun Feb 22 22:20:18 2015 UTC,"Like, you know, the amazing light armor with a crit chance bonus that you get from the same DLC."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,flashman7870,2,Mon Feb 23 07:32:50 2015 UTC,"The desert ranger helm weighs nothing and gives 5 DT iirc, worth having if it doesn't cost any health"
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,forgodandthequeen,3,Mon Feb 23 00:47:12 2015 UTC,But it's fugly. P.D. Shoot is a classy horned lady.
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,acksed,11,Mon Feb 23 07:31:50 2015 UTC,"It appears the reason the Enclave turned on the Securitrons is because one of the Securitron's rockets hit the wall it was sanding in front of and the Enclave got caught by splash damage.   I always thought you could make it through the base game. The DLCs are what's going to kill you. I don't know what level the HH NPCs start carrying AMRs and 12.7mm submachine guns, but I'd say it's something you have to worry about. That is, if the animals don't get you first. Good luck!"
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,LutrianH,36,Sun Feb 22 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"Something I love about New Vegas. In the final mission, you come face to face with the darkest side of your faction.  In the House route, you read those peace terms and realise that House is in fact a madman. Completely separated from reality, expecting the world to roll over at his feet.  In the NCR, you meet General Oliver, a glory hound of a general who would throw away a million men to see his name in the history books. And you realise that the NCR is not the band of moral paragons you thought it was.  In the Legion, you meet Lanius. The very name means ""butcher"". He is the epitome of all that is ill with Caesar's Legion, brutal, uncaring and merciless.  And if you choose to go it alone, you are forced to blow up the power generators of the Dam. You then realise you are only going to bring destruction on Vegas, and no paradise shall arise."

I'll cover that in the game when it comes up, but it's actually neither for now - there's one ludicrously powerful weapon I need for HH..."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Holyrapid,2,Mon Feb 23 09:25:09 2015 UTC,"Bozar's also 15 pounds, not exactly something you'd want to lug around to Zion along with your power armor.  If you're not getting Li'l Devil, then the only other thing I could see you going for is the Medicine Stick.  Fighting ""natives"" with a medicine stick, har har."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,Askull,3,Mon Feb 23 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"My guess is Paciencia, since its critical damage is crazy-high. It's a very deceptively powerful firearm."
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,iiRockpuppy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"I would recommend buying a riot gear helmet from the Divide, because it can be worn simultaneously with the 1st Recon Beret. There's a commissary very close to the start of the DLC, with no enemies around or up to that point. You can then back out of the the Divide and start Honest Hearts.   The critical chance bonus from the 1st Recon Beret will also help the effectiveness of the Compliance Regulator.  Tunnel Runner is a very good perk in case you consider it. If you're in CAUTION and an enemy is investigating, but you want to get out of the area quickly before it notices you, this perk will help greatly. I'm fairly sure Silent Running is mandatory for your playthrough in the DLC, for the reason that most DLC enemies are extremely perceptive if you're in their line of sight."

ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,DogBoyYesHim,3,Mon Feb 23 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, I get it.  It took me a few minutes of pondering about it.  I tried thinking about what you could possibly need 15000 caps for, but you're worried about the weight limit to Honest Hearts and want to pick up some really powerful but really light guns, eh?  I can see what you mean, the anti-material rifle is much too heavy to bring along, unfortunately, and your power armor is going to take up a good half of your carrying capacity.  That is a problem.  If I'm reading right, it seems a fully modded sniper rifle goes down to three pounds, which is good.  Vance's 9mm is pretty light too, but if you're thinking what I think you're thinking, you want something with a bit more kick that is still pretty light.  You're going to buy the Li'l Devil, aren't you?"

ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,gladtobeblazed,5,Mon Feb 23 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"My theory on why the Enclave and Securitrons turned on each other:  The Securitrons were throwing grenades, and one of the Enclave folks probably got hit by the splash damage, blamed the robot, and turned hostile toward it.  Explosives have a nasty habit in Fallout games of screwing with the way that engine handles factions (same problem/opportunity for comedy can be seen in Oblivion with wide area-of-effect Destruction spells.)"
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,edichez,6,Sun Feb 22 23:53:19 2015 UTC,The length of the episode alone makes me a bit worried. Just gonna post this and get on with the video.
ManyATrueNerd,2wsce7,ZebraRenegade,8,Sun Feb 22 20:18:48 2015 UTC,The Enclave became hostile when the trisection got too close to the wall on the dam and his grenade launcher hit the wall causing damage to the Enclave making them hostile. This happens at 23:15

ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,HetBlik,7,Sat Feb 21 23:27:08 2015 UTC,Girly screams of delight
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,fuzzyneck24,5,Sat Feb 21 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't know you could outrun the bulldozer without killing the guy driving it. When I played that part I managed to shoot him, which I thought was funny since Kelso is not a policeman."
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,pppoootttzzz,5,Sat Feb 21 21:01:39 2015 UTC,Too bad you didn't commandeer a vehicle while an insurance investigator...
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,triangular_cube,4,Sat Feb 21 21:36:33 2015 UTC,Oh blimey - what happens?
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,triangular_cube,12,Sat Feb 21 23:48:16 2015 UTC,"I guess nothing all that exciting, its just absurd. Just like how you can use the police gamewells to make phone calls as an Insurance Investigator, Kelso has access to the commandeer mechanic as well. You can even commandeer police cars from actual policemen while investigating insurance fraud cases because no one felt the need to remove that functionality from the mission."
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,PantsBonanza,2,Sun Feb 22 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"He did though, right after he jumped out of the trunk of the car. He ran up to that red car that he used in the chase. The driver got out and ran away. I mean, maybe I'm looking at it wrong, but that seems like commandeering a vehicle to me."
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,triangular_cube,2,Sun Feb 22 00:43:22 2015 UTC,Ehh kinda...its a scripted event in that chase sequence. I'm talking about the literal GTA carjack thing.
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,PantsBonanza,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Ahh, okay. I was wondering that as I wrote my earlier response. whether that was a scripted thing or an actual 'commandeering', as the game would have it."
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,RealFoxD,4,Sun Feb 22 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: According to an inflation calculator I Googled, $20,000 in 1947 would be worth $216,789.76 in 2014 US dollars.  The median award for a wrongful death lawsuit, according to Tufts University School of Law in Boston, is $250,000 (the max in their files is $7 million, but that's an exceptional case.  Then again, the death of Louis Buchwalter was a pretty exceptional case.)  So the check for $20,000 in 1947 is actually very reasonable under the circumstances as they'd have appeared to the insurance claims adjuster at the time."
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,Holyrapid,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:17:21 2015 UTC,How much would the 6 billion the Fund guys were looking to raise be in todays money.
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,RealFoxD,1 point,Sun Feb 22 06:12:49 2015 UTC,"Running the proportions through my calculator, $65,036,928,000 ($65 billion.)  That is a LOT of money...if an individual person had that kind of scratch, he'd be the fourth richest person in the world behind Bill Gates ($79 billion), Carlos Slim ($74.6B), and Warren Buffett ($73B.)  It's so much money that it would have been enough money to fund the entire budget of the United States Army for three months' worth of its 2010 fiscal year, when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still in full force and Osama bin Laden was still alive.  Or, if you really want something that'll blow your mind, in 1947 dollars, 6 billion was nearly three times the cost of the Manhattan project.  Building an A-bomb is apparently a third of the price of a freeway system."
ManyATrueNerd,2wodh9,RealFoxD,1 point,Sun Feb 22 09:29:16 2015 UTC,"While I'm on the subject, $6 billion in 1947 US dollars would be worth the following in other countries' currencies, assuming for simplicity's sake that the money is first converted to 2014 USD then simply exchanged at today's rates into the other countries' currencies:  42.24 billion British pounds, 57.15 billion Euro, $81.52 billion Canadian, $82.9 billion Australian, or 7.75 trillion Japanese yen."

ManyATrueNerd,2wld7q,SuffolksSecretSauce,2,Fri Feb 20 23:12:11 2015 UTC,Here's the biggest tips I can give you after playing the game through 100% 1) Auto Cross is literally the best stealth weapon in the game (you get it later on I believe). It's basically a baby bow but easier to aim for headshots 2) M-79 is absolutely a must for helicopters and basically everything in general. See a truck driving by? Baby Grenade Launcher 3) Hunters Syringe is so useful for outpost and Fortresses 4) Try and get all crafting to Level 3 (Kyrat Fashion Week gives you Level 4 skins but the missions are fun) I apologize for the big wall of text

ManyATrueNerd,2wld7q,DRDS1,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"So my general load out is the autocross/bow, RPG/side arm grenade launcher (I like the side arm because I can use it while driving and wreck the Pagans Wrath Convoy quickly), assault rifle/SMG, and LMG/assault rifle.  Sniper rifles seemed too weak because they start to take two shots. I just got the AMR today and haven't tested it out.   Fortresses are lots of fun, I always do them as soon as possible because I like the challenge."
ManyATrueNerd,2wld7q,dabisnit,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:39:45 2015 UTC,"The grenade launcher is, in my experience, the easiest way to deal with helicopters, and a lot of other things to boot. It's also great that it counts as a sidearm."
ManyATrueNerd,2wld7q,PigHaggerty,1 point,Sat Feb 21 08:04:04 2015 UTC,in my experience the best way to deal with helicopters is either the explosive arrows or sticky grenades. That is unless you want to carry around a rocket launcher which seems like a waste of a weapon slot.
ManyATrueNerd,2wld7q,Pepperyfish,3,Fri Feb 20 22:28:00 2015 UTC,Carrying a rocket launcher is a waste of space?   Wrong.

I know the bridge that you tried so valiantly to destroy is a lot easier with the nano, so maybe it's just that it one-shots everything, rather than has a big AoE?"

The way I remember it, it's hyped as a super-weapon but when you get it its underwhelming until you get the upgrades.

ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,Copywrites,4,Mon Feb 16 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"He could also get stealthboys from the Legion supply dropbox from the Caesar's Favor quest. The quest won't activate anymore of course, but the dropboxes resupply anyway. With Silent Running, nothing will be able to detect him, not even any DLC enemies that detect almost immediately if you just happen to fall in their line of sight.   I honestly think he's playing this the wrong way - by getting remnants armor and high DT, he's expecting damage. That remnants armor and above 40 DT will be almost useless at his level against DLC enemies, who almost certainly will be wielding hunting revolvers, brush guns and the like, all of which will easily break 50 DT, much less 40.   The far better, and provably secure method is light armor, 100 Sneak, Silent Running, and a steady supply of stealthboys. Together, these WILL make him entirely invisible to any NPCs. I would also highly recommend the Tunnel Runner perk. The stealthboys can be obtained from the always resupplying Legion dropbox.   He's basically trying to limit damage, instead of thinking of avoiding it altogether, which is just as easy as taking the stealth build mentioned above. Really, this playthrough comes down to not being detected. In the case that you are detected, there is a worthy risk of taking damage. When being detected happens consistently, probability pretty much ensures you will take damage eventually. By using a method that virtually guarantees you won't be detected by enemies, cue my strongly suggested build, risk is minimized as much as is possible, close to zero, even."
ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,RealFoxD,3,Mon Feb 16 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"I agree that stealth is pretty much the way to go most of the time. and on that note, you mention Silent Running which is not a perk Jon has, and I'm quite surprised by this given how much sneaking he does. It's practically essential for just about any stealth build, it just gives you so much more mobility, and being fast is one of the best ways to not be seen."

And this point kinda leads into two.  2) Assuming we make it through the BoHD, and we get to the DLC, let's assume you're into whatever the second DLC of the run is, and you die, then what? Are you going to going to revisit the DLC under another character?  I immensely enjoy hearing you're thoughts on lore and your reactions to certain things the games throws at you, and I'd rather be exposed to those thoughts without the under lying fear of death, you know?"
ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,Aduckonquack97,2,Mon Feb 16 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, co-signed, seconded.  Plus...  New Vegas DLC, with the possible exception of Honest Hearts, simply isn't meant to be played like the basegame.  Every DLC is like a graduate-level course in the game's most challenging elements, whether it's avoiding traps, fighting powerful enemies deliberately spawned right on top of you, being sneaky in the right places at the right times...a permadeath run WITH healing is certainly a worthwhile challenge (one I've never completed in Dead Money, because there is ALWAYS one of those stupid collar traps that gets me at least once), but a YOLO run is folly."

I think the next logical step is to start DLCs, but you do raise a good point: we haven't gotten to see Jon do these ""normally"".  He could send P.D. Shoot on an extended vacation until after the remastered ""Kill Everything"" run + DLCs. That would be a LONG time though.  Or, there are quests he hasn't done in the main game. The post Hoover Dam material could be to attempt some of those quests, though it would completely change the feel of the run, since he's no longer doing a carefully planned route to an end (beat Hoover Dam, DLCs, etc.), but simply trying quests until dying.  This means the goal of a hypothetical finish the rest of the base game really comes down to surviving in order to die from rads in Vault 34 during Hard Luck Blues."

ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,antiutopie,12,Sun Feb 15 22:07:50 2015 UTC,I did consider - I gave the Legion the working Howitzer. That could surely be fired while the President was there?
ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,HackBlowfist,13,Sun Feb 15 22:27:13 2015 UTC,You'd also think they'd send more than two guys.
ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,Yogurt_Huevos,5,Sun Feb 15 22:32:00 2015 UTC,If you gave the Legion the howitzer... Will that pose an issue during the final battle? I've never gone that far in the Legion storyline.
ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,fuzzyneck24,2,Mon Feb 16 02:04:02 2015 UTC,I THINK that's only an issue if you're doing the Legion quest...
ManyATrueNerd,2w0c9e,Yogurt_Huevos,2,Mon Feb 16 09:27:30 2015 UTC,So you gave them a howitzer and they're not going to use it on the final battle? Does it only get used if you're fighting with the Legion?  We may want to double check this so you're not dodging mortars on the dam!

Two of them, in fact - light and dark. This way I'll see everything I've missed. Also the game had rather simple battles. Not so much a problem itself but it'd be hard for MATN to show his skills and knowledge of the game.  So I don't think it's worth it unless MATN makes a definitive let's play with everything planned, all the features exposed, info extracted, developers interviewed etc. In this case it would be a best letsplay ever and I believe MATN is the right person to do it...

ManyATrueNerd,2vyafv,ManyATrueNerd,7,Sun Feb 15 09:54:51 2015 UTC,Order 1866 is the only one of those you should play with that ps4... they all (also including dying light from the op) look way better on pc than on ps4 (and run at 60fps instead of 30)... And with that budget you originally planned for the new pc it will easily be capeable of playing them at (close to) maximum settings on 1080p.   Even if you get the PS4 before the PC the wait will be worth it.

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,JMAN7102,2,Mon Feb 9 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"Tarantula hawk:       A tarantula hawk is a spider wasp which hunts tarantulas as food for its larvae. Tarantula hawks belong to any of the many species in the genera Pepsis and Hemipepsis in the family Pompilidae (spider wasps).  The more familiar species are up to 5 cm (2 in) long, with blue-black bodies and bright, rust-colored wings (other species have black wings with blue highlights), making them among the largest of wasps. The vivid coloration found on the bodies, and especially wings, of these wasps is an aposematism, advertising to potential predators the wasps' ability to deliver a powerful sting. Their long legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female Pepsis grossa can be up to 7 mm (1/3 in) long, and the sting is considered the second most painful insect sting in the world.

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,autowikibot,14,Sun Feb 8 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"Tough choice on the DLCs...  Honest Hearts is relatively easy on most play-throughs, except for the White Legs dealing tons of damage and having plenty of health in later levels. They also end up carrying the auto-shotgun, the .45 machine guns, and even AMRs on occasion. The bears and other giant creatures could also be your end. On the other hand, you can get some nice armor and the Survivalist rifle.  As for OWB...it's in my opinion the most entertaining DLC in terms of dialogue, and gives some of the best energy weapons in the game among other near things. However, I found the robo scorpions to be a giant pain in the ass on higher levels. The humanoid enemies are also quite high in number, and they pack quite a punch with their rifles and revolvers. Also, plenty of nightstalkers about. In general, it seems that the OWB enemies have stupidly high perception. I've never had a nice and clean run through OWB even with 100 stealth and the like. They just seem to be able to spot you a lot easier than vanilla enemies. Could just be me though.  Dead Money - amazing story, but you're definitely requesting a death wish if you go into this DLC with your rule set. Save it for last. I've played this DLC (and all of the others) many times, but I still die to the bomb collar in one or two specific areas because you have to move so precisely and know where the collar won't trigger.  Lonesome Road - action packed, and one-directional (not a lot of exploring around). You get some amazing weapons and armor, but the enemies are tough as hell, and deal tons of damage. I'd also recommend saving that for last or near-last. The good news about this DLC is that once you start it, you can just back up out of it and go back to the Mojave at any time. Granted that nearly all areas of the map are populated with the ghoulified soldiers, deathclaws, or worse...tunnelers."

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,HongManChoi,5,Mon Feb 9 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"Dead Money would be, by far, the most entertaining though. Even if he dies he should still do it maybe as a mini series starting with full health."

Get EDE in your group, tell him to wait somewhere outside the cave, and enjoy walking through VATSing everything in your way.   Your level 24 perk must be Light Step. You will be running in to more traps at some point, if not in the main game then definitely in the DLCs. I think making sure you don't take those large chunks of unplanned damage is more important than any perks to increase combat ability at this point.  As for the DLC, do Honest Hearts first, if only because it has the absolute best anti-nightstalker weapon in the game. The .45 submachine gun slaughters them. All the other enemies in OWB can be taken out fairly easily by weapons provided by the dlc or that you already have, but i'd say you need that .45 to prevent another incident like today's episode."

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,autowikiabot,8,Sun Feb 8 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"Oh My GOD, Jon, why would you name this part ""The Darkest Day?""  Between that and the fifty minute length, I thought FOR SURE that PD Shoot was gonna die this part!  My heart was all a pitter patter!  You seem to have a real affinity for traps, in which case, Dead Money will almost certainly kill you, given the amount of traps lying around.  Protip:  Light Step.  Never worry about another trap again.    That being said, I feel certain that Old World Blues would be certain death for you.  If the infinitely respawning gang-ganking bullet sponge enemies don't kill you, then the giant robo scorpion almost certainly would.  Honest Hearts is honestly the safest DLC at this point as it has a lot of wide open spaces and places for you to snipe and you aren't really forced to do all that much fighting.  The downside, however, is that Honest Hearts has a tendency to lag in its creature spawns and, unfortunately at your level, spawn really big, really nasty enemies right on top of you.  I've had yao guais and giant cazadores (why did they need to be giant?) spawn right on top of me, which is certain death for you.  But maybe you'll get lucky.  So here's how I'm seeing things:  Old World Blues:  100% certain death Lonesome Road:  80% probable death Dead Money:  65% likely death Honest Hearts:  40% risk of death  With that said, I want to cast my vote for Dead Money as the first DLC you do.  Dead Money does not scale with level and you don't get to keep any of your equipment (except Motor Runner's Helmet and, surprise surprise, the rebreather...well, any quest related items really) and Dead Money has some really nice rewards.  The fully upgraded Holorifle is one of the best energy weapons in the game and Dead Money will give you access to unlimited amounts of several items, most notably weapon repair kits.  You can break the bank at the casino for 10k+ pre-war money and you get to keep some gold bars.  If that wasn't enough, you can also take with you several thousand .357 ammo from the locker at the bunker in the end."
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,NoOneImportant4,4,Sun Feb 8 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure Dead Money does scale with level. But given 100 Energy Weapons skill, a sneak attack holorifle shot to a limb is enough to kill them in one hit regardless of level scaling and difficulty setting.   He'll need to make each shot count. The ones that throw spears can do a lot of damage, and cripple limbs easily.   I agree that if he does complete Dead Money, get all vending machine codes, and break the bank, he'll have a decent advantage going into the other DLC. The weapon repair kits won't be extremely useful, especially because one aim of this playthrough is to minimize combat, but he'll have an endless supply of .308 rounds for sniping."
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,Revelations216,6,Mon Feb 9 00:18:49 2015 UTC,"It is almost irrelevant that you can one shot enemies in Dead Money. The fact that you take damage just being outside makes that a death sentence in this ruleset. I suppose you can account for that damage, but then any hit at all leaves total health questionable because did I take the tic of damage before or after being hit by a ghost person.  If you make it to DLC then Honest Hearts is the only one I can see being done with a good chance of survival. Because of that it gets my vote.   By the way, the battle for the dam is the end of the game including DLC. If you take any damage there will you account for it when you reload a save to take on DLC? Or will that just not count in your true life counter? I hope you can clarify some of these points going forward /u/ManyATrueNerd ."
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,Hanidalon,6,Mon Feb 9 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"My intention is to fight Hoover Dam, and then recreate the damage I took (in terms of limbs) and XP (by killing something easy like big horner herds), and carry over the true health counter to the DLC."
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,Revelations216,2,Mon Feb 9 10:07:38 2015 UTC,"A thought caught me by surprise today - I think I realized without question which DLC to complete first - Honest Hearts, almost entirely because of the Compliance Regulator. But I think you should first make a brief trip to the divide to buy a riot gear helmet, come back and wear that with the 1st Recon beret, allowing you to take advantage of the critical chance bonus, and thus the Compliance Regulator, without sacrificing DT.   Maybe you could also get some stealthboys from the Legion supply cache from the Caesar's Favor quest. According to the page:   If the player later acquires negative reputation with the Legion, the quest marker will no longer appear. However, the Legion will continue to restock the cache boxes. With the location now known, the player can still take items regularly even without Caesar's permission, and without Karma loss.    I think you should have more confidence in Sneak. I know for certain based on my experiences that 100 Sneak and Silent Running will let you crouch run in front of virtually everything in the Mojave without being detected - I crouch ran through Dead Wind Cavern and Deathclaw Promontory with these stats just for the sake of trying it out. Add a stealthboy to that, and you've got the same effect as Fallout 3 Chinese stealth armor. I'm not saying you should try to test the limits of Sneak in this way, but for greatly reducing the occurrences of aggroing enemies to even almost zero, it's strongly recommended as mentioned to have 100 Sneak and Silent Running.   Although Sneak works well in the Mojave, for some reason the devs chose to greatly diminish its effectiveness in the DLC by having humanoid enemies instantly detect you or otherwise force you into CAUTION mode regardless of your Sneak skill if you're in their line of sight. The workaround to this isn't too bad - if you're not in their line of sight, sneak for purposes works works the same as it does toward enemies in the Mojave. Other enemies are highly perceptive in the same way - deathclaws of the Divide, roboscorpions of Old World Blues. For the latter, your only option is to know beforehand where they show up and get stealthboys ready for those occasions. You'll actually be guaranteed at evading them this way, because you'll in essence have the effectiveness of Fallout 3 Chinese stealth armor, but if you happen to bump into one, PD Shoot should say her final words.   As always, keep up with silenced, long range sniping wherever possible. You can handle most of Honest Hearts this way. You should have a stealthboy at the ready for the beginning ambush on the caravan crew. Then step back as far as possible and take out the white legs with your suppressed, but not totally silent AMR. Watch out as you cross the precarious-looking bridge. A white leg shows up and is scripted to fire at you even if you're hidden, but you can quickly take him out before he takes a single shot with one shot from the AMR. It's smooth sailing afterward. Watch out for creature spawns though, but there's nothing else incredibly dangerous for your playthrough besides the opening of the DLC.   You can do this Jon! Well, at least Honest Hearts. It is very much possible. Stealthboys, 100 Sneak and Silent Running are absolute necessities though for Old World Blues and Lonesome Road!"
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,carl1984,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"The intro ambush is actually easy, just stay still where you spawn and crouch and they don't aggro you. They kill the caravan and finish their script, stand still, and let you snipe them off"

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Mon Feb 9 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"I thought the same as you did when Jon started the YOLO run, but I was mistaken.  You only take periodic damage in Dead Money in hardcore mode, which Jon has turned off.  In normal mode, the only threats of damage are from the ghost people, the holograms and from thick clouds.  Thick clouds can be avoided altogether, so that's not a problem, and with the proper set up of perks, ghost people can be taken down fairly quickly as well.  Holograms are game-enders, but can be dealt with simply by going past them really, really fast."
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,Revelations216,1 point,Mon Feb 9 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"You take damage just by being outside ONLY on Hardcore mode. Otherwise, only the concentrated cloud areas deal damage. Taking Dean Domino with him, he can use the perk for temporary immunity to the cloud.   In any circumstance, Dead Money is extremely risky in comparison with Honest Hearts, which I agree should be done first because it's much easier compared to the others.   Most importantly, though apparently not mentioned so far, he gets the COMPLIANCE REGULATOR from Honest Hearts, the perfect weapon for dealing with close encounters and fast moving enemies (just like in this episode), or getting out of a bad situation (being chased by a deathclaw). I think before doing that he should also go into Lonesome Road just to buy a riot gear helmet from the commissary, which can be simultaneously worn with the 1st Recon beret for +5 critical chance. Then Jon can step back and be fully prepared for Honest Hearts."

Ghost people are mutated humans, changed forever by the Cloud, a combination of corrosive rust-like toxins unique to Sierra Madre. This same red cloud clings to the walls and lingers like a thick smog in localized areas and even escapes and is reabsorbed continuously from the Ghost People's hazmat suit by means of aeration on their legs, indicating that their mutation may well originate from constant exposure to the Cloud. This has resulted in them being the only ones able to walk in and out of the Cloud unharmed. The ghost people originate from the construction workers before the Great War who were mutated from the cloud as they worked on the Sierra Madre Villa. They have several ties to inhumane experiments of Big MT. According to data from terminals in the medical section of the Sierra Madre, construction workers at the site first received their hazmat suits specially created in the Big MT after a gas leak sent one of them to the hospital. A terminal in Big MT states that the gas leak itself was also created at Big MT, the hazmat suits being an ""experiment within an experiment."" The hazmat suit was bulky, nearly impossible to speak through, grew stiff with use, and had locks that, after contact with the Cloud, corroded to the point where the hazmat suit had to be cut open with a cosmic knife, and still didn't provide proper protection from the poisonous gas cloud.

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,bolsey,2,Mon Feb 9 05:18:17 2015 UTC,"I just played all the DLC recently as a sniper+sneak character and I think Honest Hearts to start.  Honest hearts is quite easily finished if you skip the side quests. The animals are easy to snipe but the tribals will murder Jon if he isn't super careful. Fighting the white legs only has one quest that is really dangerous, but I think there are safer options. No ambushes right on top of you though which is great.   OWB isn't bad but the ambushes at X-8 and around could kill Jon. You need a lot of AP bullets on scorpions too, because regular ammo seems to do nothing on them at least at higher levels. Luckily if Jon takes it slow and brings pulse mines he can probably clear through the main content even easier than HH  Dead Money is actually quite easy but the cloud would end up killing Jon. It seems difficult to not take cloud damage as it's a poor lit zone and the clouds don't have concrete markers for where they end. Add in holograms and not being able to bring any gear in to the DLC makes it impossible. It's too bad because there's literally 200k caps worth of prewar money and gold bars"
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,RealFoxD,2,Tue Feb 10 00:28:28 2015 UTC,Honest Hearts has some lovely storytelling and lots of floor traps.. I look forward to Jon's reaction to both of these things.

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,Cody878,2,Tue Feb 10 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"Jon, you were musing about the bathroom area in the Silver Rush- that's there because of some cut content. The guy who gets shot as soon as you enter the building for the first time was initially intended to start out back there, and be marched into the front of the store, but Obsidian ran out of time to polish the scene properly, so it was cut down to what we have now. There are some comments in the code about it, and Freeside Open, which restores some cut content, partially adds that back in."
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,ZebraShark,2,Tue Feb 10 07:11:11 2015 UTC,Rex's quest is weird. You cut out his brain and put in a new one. How does he still remember anything? He's not even Rex anymore! Even for Fallout this makes no sense.
ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,Schweinii,7,Tue Feb 10 07:56:19 2015 UTC,That's my view too - you're giving that brain a new dog transplant... But the end narration suggests that both dogs' memories blend together

ManyATrueNerd,2v84b5,dabisnit,2,Wed Feb 11 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Posted in the YouTube comments, but YouTube is a cesspool.    Get some maths going on and figure out exactly how many hit points you HAVE to lose to the Cloud in Dead Money, and how many rads are forced in Lonesome Road.  Honest Hearts should be first, since the risk/reward is the best.      Other things to take into consideration, in no particular order:  Honest Hearts + probably the safest: bear traps in the water, White Legs, yao guai, sparse Cazadores, the Father's traps, and geckos. None should be an issue at your level of stealth. + nets you the Survivalist's Rifle and Joshua Graham's Armor.    Dead Money * It's relatively stealth-oriented, so easy to avoid enemy damage. - The Cloud will force a great deal of damage. Calculating forced Cloud damage would be advantageous. - Bear Traps. P.D. Shoot is not good with bear traps. * Ghost People have relatively low PER for the recommended starting level of Dead Money, and the holograms aren't meant to see you until you've had a chance to disable them. - The fight with Elijah is nearly impossible to avoid without quicksave-spamming, as he has high PER. - You take damage from explosions as you're exiting the Vault. - Dead Money has less reward than the other DLC. The reward is basically caps that you probably won't be able to get without quicksave-spamming, which you don't do. + Reinforced Sierra Madre Armor is the best light armor in the game.    Lonesome Road * Meant to be endgame, but the enemies do not scale. One HP sniper round to the face will finish a Deathclaw, and one AP sniper round will finish a Marked Man.(Assuming full weapon condition). Also, fun fact, one explosive Anti-Mat round to the face kills Rawr. - Has a great amount of radiation; calculating forced rads would be advantageous. - Marked Men at the end are bound to get a few pot-shots in with energy weapons, even if you avoid the Ulysses fight. + Lonesome Road has commissaries, which translate to infinite caps for getting all the best GRA equipment.    Old World Blues - World is heavily populated by enemies that scale with you, and have high DPS and DT for their level. - The ambushes of Dr. Mobius will be difficult to pass by without taking damage, as the quarters will be close when they spawn in. + OWB implants + OWB goodies      Thanks for reading the whole thing. Sorry."

After all the damage he's taken to get the power armor, he's used it what, three times I think?

ManyATrueNerd,2v9gl7,ManyATrueNerd,2,Mon Feb 9 10:12:03 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Because when you checked your limbs literally the only damage showing was the recent leg damage and it seems to me there should have already been at least some from the few times you've been injured before.  Imgur
ManyATrueNerd,2v9gl7,Drokash,2,Mon Feb 9 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"Rads won't decrease automatically unless Jon takes the Rad Absorption or another similar Perk. The same goes for crippled limbs, they won't ever heal automatically without a certain perk except said perk is in Fallout 3 and not New Vegas, so without the usual limb-healing methods, Jon won't ever be able to recover from crippled limb damage."
ManyATrueNerd,2v9gl7,NoOneImportant4,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:57:17 2015 UTC,"While it is true that limbs require damage dealt to them to be crippled, being crippled, I am fairly sure, is the same as an effect.

ManyATrueNerd,2v2qea,Onurpike,3,Sun Feb 8 02:56:43 2015 UTC,Same solution as the auto-healing.  Jon just remembers how much HP he truly has and deducts any damage he takes from that.
ManyATrueNerd,2v2qea,Grandpa_Edd,5,Sat Feb 7 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the solution for the normal healthbar, but the limbs, head and torso get healed as well, and you can't simulate their status (if crippled: lower acuracy, lower movement speed, lower perception, etc) but those disadvantages would influence chances of survival."

Honest Hearts should be easily manageable, especially because the map is very open, allowing for lots of sniping.

ManyATrueNerd,2tnbtb,TheNormalSun,0,Sun Jan 25 21:34:42 2015 UTC,Please go with Yes Man. He is the morally better route since you can solve diplomatically with the Brotherhood.

It's a big if, but if he repopulates another world free of radiation and general post-apocalypse'ness then humanity is almost guaranteed to survive.   If you were forced to make the choice between killing House or killing the BoS (Yes-Man vs House), I'm not sure that killing House is the morally superior choice.   Arguably, House has already done more for the wasteland as a whole than the BoS, and with his intellect and technology he has probably the best chance of any single person to ""save"" humanity."

ManyATrueNerd,2tjnls,RealFoxD,6,Sun Jan 25 09:33:07 2015 UTC,"Two notes on adultery being ""illegal in 21 states"" in today's America:  1) Lawrence v. Texas (2004), the landmark Supreme Court case which struck down America's anti-sodomy laws (homosexuality was a felony in many American states before that point, and the sodomy statute was so broadly defined that a heterosexual couple that did anything other than missionary-position babymaking sex was also technically committing a crime---in Virginia, it was a Class 4 felony, for example, to engage in...ahem most of the more fun forms of foreplay), brought to an end most other forms of police interference with what people do in their bedrooms and with whom.  Public opinion took care of the rest; it'd be a disaster for any DA to try and prosecute an adulterer these days.  2) Realistically, adultery effectively ceased to be a legal issue with the widespread adoption of no-fault divorce in the 1970s, and you'd have to be a pretty high-profile public figure (say, a famous police officer/detective renowned for his honour and morally upstanding reputation) for it to be a criminal matter.  ...fair bet Cole Phelps, besides the hammer Marie and her attorney were about to drop on him, was probably out a stiff fine between that last vice case and getting into the green car, although that paled in comparison to the amount of money his driving cost him making the city whole for the damages..."
ManyATrueNerd,2tjnls,bluegreenwookie,2,Sun Jan 25 08:47:14 2015 UTC,"This is speculation but I don't think it was a crime in the sense you can get fined/arrested however at the time I believe it was one of the few ways for a woman to get a divorce.   Plus Phelps being a war hero it looks extra bad on the department. Its a scandal, its political, and she's German right after WW2.  I'll look into it if it was a full on crime when I get home.

ManyATrueNerd,2tjnls,SuffolksSecretSauce,2,Sun Jan 25 09:32:33 2015 UTC,"It was sudden from the players perspective but again that's not so bad. I mean Cole goes from beat cop to Vice in what seems like a few days in-game but in reality it's been a couple of years, no?     I just think that it's meant to be sudden, it breaks down the whole Cole is a superhero mythos, which considering what's around the corner, fits in nicely.   I think when the story ends, you'll find it far more palatable that he behaves this way. He is human after all. Very human."
ManyATrueNerd,2tjnls,SuffolksSecretSauce,7,Sun Jan 25 09:59:50 2015 UTC,"I get from the flashbacks (which I've been mainly cutting out) that he's got a bit of a hero-complex, it's slightly vain, he's slightly smug superior, but one quality I did think he had was that he had his own internal strong morality - hence his dislike of the compromise in Vice. That, to me, meant the logical way Vice would have gone was that he'd get too caught up in his black-and-white worldview, and get screwed over by Salmon Sleeves, rather than because Cole himself, a man who gives lectures about doing the right thing and being conscitentious and climbing his way up by being exceptional, just suddenly decided to have an affair..."
ManyATrueNerd,2tjnls,forgodandthequeen,1 point,Sun Jan 25 10:07:34 2015 UTC,I think he's talks the talk but never quite got to walk the walk. The flashbacks do tell that story. /u/triangular_cube said it best below. He's back to a world where he's alienated and misunderstood and finds solace in the only place he finds it. He's a decorated hero for being... well we'll see. It's brilliantly written to me. So real.

ManyATrueNerd,2tjnls,Falltangle,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"It just feels lazy though. Phelps has been sort of an emotional void, with the game focusing on his job.

You're great at commentary, and that is what sets you apart from many of the other people who've done play throughs of this.  Now for hopefully helpful info; The M-700 is pretty good, I used it for a long time in the games, but easily the best sniper is the Z93, which you have to find in a mission, or off a dead enemy very late in game. In my opinion, it's better than the unique variant, which is an AMR, due to being able to equipt a silencer. It also one hit kills everything. Just remember the phrase ""reaganomics"", that's where you can find the rifle.  Have you tried the other sight for your bow? It's a little difficult to understand at first, but after you learn to use it, you can hit a lot farther away than with the sight you're using.   Also, is this going to be your only playthrough of it? Or do you plan to try and adapt some challenges like your Fallout runs at a later point in time?"

I'm not that knowledgeable in the whole ""youtube scene"", but the way I understand it, it is an intersting new form of theater, where the actors/producers develop their roles over time (with feedback from the audience).   Like Pewdiepie found success as ""pretty foreign geek who is scared easily"" and is makeing millions now as ""pretty successful geek with neat video editing skills"".  The role I enjoy you in the most is ""British intellectual gentleman in insane situations"" (like in that Far Cry game with the eagles).

Your a smart guy, and when you know what you are doing in a game, it's so entertaining. I'd perfer more series than one off. Take game grumps for example. They rarely play an entire game through. They sit down one day, record 2 or so hours of a game, then move on. Then later they break it up into parts and release them every couple days. By part 6 or wherever they stopped I am usually left wanting more. When in reality it's been 4 weeks since they recored that episode and have already moved on. Keep doing what you are doing. We have people to satisfy the one offs and cery few who do series as well as you."

Oh, and you being dead of course.  I refuse to do the twitter. It's part of a general boycott against wildly proliferating social media platforms, and/or congenital laziness.  Anyway, I'm happy to have a chance to say: thanks for all the awesome videos you make!  Watching you ""destroy"" that bridge had tears of laughter running down my face. From the first minutes when you so confidently framed the bridge for a theatrical demolition, which promptly went thwipppbt, to the bitter end when you knocked out one last strut for the final .1 percent and the game went ""you know what? fuck it, fine it's destroyed, piss off""   One of my favorite things ever."

Last time I did it I did sunshine boogy and cleared the ants which got me to liked, but didn't move me on in the quest. Only after getting the reputation from talking to the mini boomers did the quest tell me to go talk to Pearl.  With the game trying to be mysterious with the bomber, I think that's suppose to be the kid not getting the message about not telling you. You can ask Jack about it and he will say that he's not suppose to tell you about ""the lady"" and that Loyal would yell at him for it."
ManyATrueNerd,2supyx,theflyingcheese,7,Sun Jan 18 19:43:25 2015 UTC,Have you checked wearing a Mark 2 reinforced combat helmet with the rebreather? Only 1 less dt than the power helmet and 3 more dr!   For shits and giggles (and a much higher DT) you can actually wear the Space Helmet with a Riot helmet (from Lonesome Road) underneath. DT 8 headgear!
ManyATrueNerd,2supyx,KingBasketCase,4,Mon Jan 19 06:50:31 2015 UTC,Do you really want him to figure out which is better again? You must really like math.
ManyATrueNerd,2supyx,Fallout-IV,2,Mon Jan 19 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking too. The benefit of using a Mk2 helmet+rebreather starts at 34 damage (100/3*1) rather than 200 (100/3*6) since you only need to make up for 1 DT. Still might not be the best for Jon though, since he's trying to avoid situations where he'll take that much damage. Would work well for a normal playthrough though."
ManyATrueNerd,2supyx,KingBasketCase,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"Just did two run-throughs of the final mission as House (one at 19 one at 50) and had these weapons being used by the Legion. The individual weapons were actually in about the same state of repair for both runs.   Marksman Carbine: Average damage 20. 15 at lvl 50. 8 at lvl 19. Super Sledge: Avg dmg 40. 10 at lvl 50. 7 at lvl 19. Thermic Lance: Avg Dmg 60. 4 at lvl 50. 4 at lvl 19. Anti-Material Rife: Avg Dmg 105. 5 at lvl 50. 5 at lvl 19 (these may be a fixed number, same with chainsaws) Chainsaws: Avg Dmg 50. 5 at lvl 50. 5 at lvl 19. Hunting Rifle: Avg Dmg 40. 6 at lvl 50. 5 at lvl 19. Lever-Action Shotgun: Avg Dmg (per pellet) 3.8. 3 at lvl 50. 4 at lvl 19. Hunting Shotgun: Avg Dmg 8. 1 at lvl 50. 10 at lvl 19. Fire Axe: Avg Dmg 32. 2 at lvl 50. 3 at lvl 19. Sledgehammer: Avg Dmg 15. 0 at lvl 50. 3 at lvl 19.     Of course these weapons are random, but the damage the weapons dealt per hit were relatively uniform between the two runs.   With the Power Armor and Mk2 helmet he'll have a DT of 40*** (would have  been 43 if he had gone with remnants power armor). With Slasher, med x and the Rebreather he'll be at 53 DR.  For these weapons the damage difference with the additional 3 dr and 1 less dt is rather small, but when you need every hitpoint you can get it is substantial.    With 50 DR and 41 DT the AMR would deal 11.5. With 53 DR and 40 DT the AMR would deal 9.35.  50 DR 41 DT Marksman Carbine would deal 2 damage. 53 DR 40 DT Marksman Carbine would deal 1.88 damage.  50 DR 41 DT Thermic Lance - 6 damage. 53 DR 40 DT Thermic Lance - 5.64 damage.  50 DR 41 DT Hunting Rife - 4 damage. 53 DR 40 DT - 3.76 damage    For the final mission at least it would be much better to have the rebreather and Mk2 in combination with power armor instead of the power armor helmet.

I didn't look very hard, but it doesn't seem like such a category even exists, which means that if I were to do it, I could define it as I see fit.  As Jon has pointed out in his no-kill run, it's impossible to do every single quest in New Vegas simply because some of them are opposing quests.  However, it should be possible to pick up every unique weapon and every unique armor.  There are also a lot of unique misc. items, but I'm not sure those should count."

If you took damage during an episode and the footage messed up in such a way you had to re-do it, would you scrap everything that happened originally or try and re-create the scenario as it happened? I'm really genuinely curious. Also more Pippa farm in the future would be great, I really am enjoying this a lot more than is reasonable."
ManyATrueNerd,2s2oxl,IAmJacksPokedEye,9,Sun Jan 11 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, it's neve happened when I took damage, and the recording was not at all recoverable.  If it did, I suppose I'd have to legitimately redo it, even if that meant potentially avoiding damage - deliberately allowing myself to be hurt would be weird, and would sound fake, I reckon.  If it were something like the Overseer office trap, I'd probably acknowledge what had happened, and walk freely into the trap, though.  Not sure, really - would depend on the circumstances."

At 12 minutes or so, you mention ""legally, yes"" when the guy asks about the warrant---in the US, the Fourth Amendment is a bit fuzzy on this.  People are ""protected from unlawful search and seizure"", but in practice, police with probable cause are generally allowed to make warrantless searches.  This power wasn't abused nearly as badly in 1947 as it is today (when any cop who has a sufficiently fertile imagination can dream up probable cause, especially when going into a black person's home or place of business), but then as now, cops were given the benefit of the doubt in a Machiavellian ends-and-means sort of way."

One of those papers was indeed gender & sexuality in the ancient world. Why? There's a lot of crossover between that and history and theatre, which I was also studying, so doing one helped the others.  And you're right that it wasn't a hard science - neither's ancient history, ancient theatre, ancient literature, or any single part of my degree, so that wasn't really a concern."

ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,Jethro_McCrazy,4,Mon Jan 5 11:32:50 2015 UTC,"For a while I thought Dead Money would for sure be P.D. Shoot's final resting place.  So much so that I thought I'd whip up my own game and see just how far I could get into the DLC without healing.  I kicked myself after a minute when I realized that I wasn't taking periodic damage.  It seems that the air in Dead Money only does periodic damage to you in hardcore mode.  In normal mode, all you have to worry about is the Cloud and the ghost people.  Which, although I didn't, I'm sure there are ways to plan around both of those things."
ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,Jethro_McCrazy,4,Mon Jan 5 12:53:53 2015 UTC,I was thinking of the collar to be honest. I figured the ghosts could be handled. The collar and the holograms are the tough part. Plus that one section where Dog is ready to blow everyone to Oblivion.

But even if you were to pulse mine the crap out of all the places the robo-scorps spawn, I don't know that you'd be able to escape damage. I think you'd be in the blast radius.  I dunno. I just feel like all the DLCs are pretty suicidal. Maybe ask your viewers if they want you to do DLC in this run? I'd rather see you win than die doing something highly elective. It's one thing to jump through hoops to get power armor. At least that was supposedly to make you more survivable (though you never actually wear the armor). Doing the DLC seems like it's missing the point of the run.  Just my opinion. I'll watch, and probably enjoy, regardless.  Maybe save before you do the final quest, and if you beat it, do a DLC victory lap?"

Unlike every other set of glasses when you have Four Eyes, which offer +2 PER (for an overall +1 PER over your base SPECIAL), the Lucky Shades give +3 PER.  2) I assume the mass murder of NCR troopers to get their tags when you can simply pickpocket a lot of them is to reduce the chance of pickpocket failure causing aggro and combat?  3) The compelling argument of House does not compel me at all, all I get from it is a delusional egocentric belief. 20 years to restart high tech development? Fine, based on the technology shown at the Securitron Bunker, it could be possible to recreate that. 50 years to get a man in orbit? Okay, I can acquiesce to the rationale behind that, it'd need a lot of focused effort, but in 50 years, the education program can train the appropriate people in the appropriate skills. 100 years to launch Colony Ships? No Howard Hughesuse, you aren't ever going to convince me that that'll be anything but total folly. It took Voyager 1 35 years to escape the Heliopause. 37 years from launch, it has only covered 0.2% of a light year. The nearest star, Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light years away. Before factoring in the state of constant acceleration, it'd take several centuries to cover one light year. (WARNING: Napkin maths follows! If distance travelled is 0.2% of a Light Year in 37 years, so [2/1000 = 37 years] then 37 * 500 = 18500 for one 1l.y, 18500 * 4.2 = 77700 years. As stated though, acceleration is a less restricted mistress in space, but the overall maths to me say never gonna happen.)  Bear in mind, that's the speed of a space probe (721 kg at launch) and acceleration, and a full blown colony ship would have to be significantly larger, requiring immense amounts of resources, something that the post-apocalyptic Earth is lacking.  Personal judgement: House is a delusional fool, whose 200 year cybernetic isolation has clouded his judgement."
ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,antiutopie,10,Sun Jan 4 23:23:32 2015 UTC,"re 2 - I just felt it was safer to use Mr Sandman than pickpocket.  As for 3, House does say he's an expert on human longevity - I just assume that he knows it'll take a while to get humans onto other worlds, but he's got a plan to appropriately extend lifespans.  Plus, in general, the Fallout verse has nuclear cars and companies like REPCONN - I assume space travel in general is more advanced."

Vault Technology and Enclave Technology. That's how  The Enclave's original plan to survive a nuclear war was simply to find another planet to live on after blowing up Earth. A spacecraft designed to ferry the human race to another planet was either under construction or ready to go before the War. The plan was for the government to flee to the oil rig, study the vault experiments for any potential problems that may pop up during the many generation journey to another solar system, and then leave."
ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,nosaJay19,4,Wed Jan 7 07:12:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, House may have exaggerated a bit with how soon and how efficiently he'll get humanity to populate the stars.  But, if you choose his ending, do you think he wouldn't eventually be able to?  It might not be in 100 years, but that's fine, isn't it?"
ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,Drokash,3,Mon Jan 5 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Assuming you pick him, House holds on very tenuous grounds.   He's only able to keep Vegas as an independent state because 1) The only two factions currently vying for his land are too busy fighting one another to risk taking him on 2) He has a super-human on his side.  Regarding point 2, the Courier will only live for so long. And House can't use his life-extending powers on her without taking away her ability to act as a physical agent. So let's hope House can find another protege in the time being (who also decides to not kill his atrophied ass).  Point 1 is a bit more bleak. Yeah, we can expect Legion to fall after failing to hold the Dam, but that isn't great for House. Now instead of having one, solitary force that will strategize and attack at once, he has ~26 divided tribes that have only known war for the last couple of decades. He'll have lunatics pounding on his wall 24/7. The Securitrons will be able to fend them off easily, but House will need a dedicated force just keeping those assholes away.  And then we have the big guys.   NCR will fall back, but they won't die. Not like Legion. They'll continue to grow and prosper, extending their land in all directions but Vegas. Up through Washington and Oregon. Out to Utah and Colorado. It'll only take a couple of generations before NCR starts encroaching on Nevada again, and you know they'll want it.  Except now House loses his edge. He doesn't have the precarious balance of power to slip through. He can't rely on shoddy NCR supply lines any more.   He's surrounded. Disorganized raiders on one side, powerhouse nation on the other.   Vegas will fall -either diplomatically or forcefully- before he can pick a planet to colonize.   And this assumes that no other nation will rise up and try to take Vegas."
ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,forgodandthequeen,2,Tue Jan 6 07:25:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how you missed it, but a very large part of House's plan is turning Vegas into a super attraction for the NCR.  He's not worried about the NCR crushing him because they're gonna be his best customers.  After a few generations, the alliance between House and the NCR is gonna be so strong that no one is going to think of House as an outside force.  House is gonna be for the NCR what Google is for us today, times about a thousand."

ManyATrueNerd,2rbx6k,madmutant01,3,Wed Jan 7 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Beyond what you stated there. The plan even with the technology is questionable.  His ambitions are rooted in the past because they're idyllic, and quaint in a retro-future sense. Through the power of science, we'll reach to the stars and all our problems will be solved. Never mind the details, those are irrelevant.   Which is why I always viewed him as a charlatan huckster. He has no interest in the difficulties and nuances of society building or space colonization. His plan seems to be 1. Build Spaceships 2. Send people into space 3. ??????? 4. There are never any problems ever again the end."

Benny's coup would have been more of a problem and his relations with the rest of the families is strained at best. The Omertas eagerly betrayed him and the White Glove society strongly considers it. After the second battle of Hoover Dam the Legion comes in to clean up what remains of House's army. Say what you will about Caesar but his frumentarii are pretty legit at screwing up everybody else's plans.  By keeping his doors closed to everybody (without a Courier he could pick somebody else, but it seems unlikely) he severely hamstrings himself. House's plan is the only one that hinges so strongly on a single person. NCR and Legion have many players in their goals, but House only has himself and the Courier. Without the Courier his plan fails.   But of course there is a Courier. A young woman named ""Please Don't Shoot"" who has chosen to aid House. So he will succeed (as long as she isn't killed by Cazadores or shotgun traps or a praying mantis)"

ManyATrueNerd,2r83j4,Corrom,5,Sat Jan 3 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Thank-you ,Jon, for making any game fun to watch."
ManyATrueNerd,2r83j4,maldwag,7,Sat Jan 3 19:19:28 2015 UTC,I have this game. The story ramps up and gets surprisingly dark for what it presents itself as. Seems to be theme with the series. As well as the theme of you having to repair a stud farm that is at the brink of being sold/destroyed for development etc.  Less points is better. A refusal in cross country is worth 20 faults and a pole knocked down in show jumping is worth 4 faults.  My tips for cross country and show jumping are to just stay in third gear/canter and go up to a gallop for the long ones.
ManyATrueNerd,2r83j4,forgodandthequeen,5,Sat Jan 3 20:27:37 2015 UTC,Shhhh! We don't tell the Americans we don't talk that way! Good day.

ManyATrueNerd,2r51dv,SuffolksSecretSauce,2,Sat Jan 3 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Grenades are actually great for fishing, at least, if your intention is just killing lots of fish. The lethality of a grenade comes from the concussive force in what would normally be the air; the heat and light are almost incidental. In water, the shock is much deadlier.  p.s. I think the eagle might just continue to dog you until you solve the problem with bullets."

ManyATrueNerd,2qvbxc,ManyATrueNerd,5,Wed Dec 31 09:45:54 2014 UTC,"My friend, 100k is nothing you will blast past that."
ManyATrueNerd,2qvbxc,ManyATrueNerd,8,Wed Dec 31 10:08:09 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say that - at current growth rates, we'd look at 55,000 in 2015 as quite achievable. That leaves 45,000 to just get from... somewhere. So 100k means a few videos going big, some press coverage, maybe some collaborations. It's certainly not going to be simple."
ManyATrueNerd,2qvbxc,ManyATrueNerd,4,Wed Dec 31 10:17:02 2014 UTC,"You will make a new Fallout Series that will get featured on Kataku and that will give you a major boost again. Colab videos usually gain quite a lot of views no matter who it is you colab with because people want to see whats up. If you make some really good videos, or really funny videos that people spread around the interwebs than its really a short period of time until the 100K. Plus as you grow larger the faster you start growing."
ManyATrueNerd,2qvbxc,TheRealMe99,3,Wed Dec 31 15:25:48 2014 UTC,"I have been noticing growth slowly accelerating recently, that's certainly true."
ManyATrueNerd,2qvbxc,ManyATrueNerd,3,Wed Dec 31 15:33:26 2014 UTC,Kotaku writing about your Fallout and Mass Effect series surely gave an unexpected boost this year

He is very dedicated to his very small community and is able to get feedback from them daily because he uploads everyday. Equally, his community is very dedicated to him, as he recently did a series of videos where he filmed the unboxing of gifts that were in Christmas advent calendar form from his community (each member contributed a gift to a large package so that each gift was opened on a specific day)! He usually does Super Mario World hacks, but his interests span a wide variety of platforming games.  His most well known video would be cat planet, part 2 here.

He updates regularly and reminds me a lot of Jon, especially in how he talks about games. He has a webcam which he uses very sparingly, usually just at the end of the video.  Something unique to his channel is that he sometimes plays games which he finds on indiedb, rather than just popular indie games. He's got a small channel at 2000 subs.  I found him because I was looking for a decent let's play of Alien: Isolation after I found out Jon wasn't going to have one. It was the only decent one I found (besides Birgirpall, but that's a different kind of entertainment). So, I'd give it a solid recommendation to everyone here."

Some channels, the cynicism is so thick in the commentary and the playthroughs seemingly more about meta-humour or a ""too cool for school"" attitude that all the joy is sucked out of them.  Especially in the Fallout Kill Everything runs, but to a degree in every good game, there's a real sense of joy that exudes from everything, and that makes it fun to watch.  Keep it up!"

Takes ~1 week for soldiers to re-spawn at all the camps. Camp Forlorn Hope has a weird bug in my game (don't know if it's global due to running an ass-ton of mods) that they drop 2 tags each.  I've played all week on a new save getting up to where Jon is and waiting on him to pick a route.
ManyATrueNerd,2phr3c,First_Man_on_Uranus,2,Wed Dec 17 05:55:23 2014 UTC,"I still stand by the fact that since he is going to be doing a legion run already, House would be more beneficial this run for views, because he would have explored each questline on his channel.  Also you call NCR, Yes Man and House ""walking simulator"", even though Jon is able to cut out any boring walking parts.  Not only that but your advocating he get an unlimited supply of stealth boys, so I fail to see how P.D. Shoot being invisible all of the time would be anymore entertaining to viewers."
ManyATrueNerd,2phr3c,First_Man_on_Uranus,2,Tue Dec 16 21:10:04 2014 UTC,"If Jon comes in and tells me I'm wrong, then it's a different story, but what seems obvious to me is that Jon plays until a set point, regardless of time, and cuts it down to 3o mins. So, 30 mins of boring Omertas is still 30 mins of boring Omertas, as shown by the No-Kill run episode with the boring Omertas. Sure, Jon is very charming and tries to liven it up, but it isn't the same as in the Legion where you go from destroying a bunker, to killing House, dealing with the factions, breaking a vault, then capping Kimball. I used it more as a comparison: ""This is what an entire episode could be devoted to, and this is the more fun alternative""."
ManyATrueNerd,2phr3c,Pommy356,5,Tue Dec 16 21:15:32 2014 UTC,"I tend to aim for 30 minutes, but the amount of footage it takes varies - on some occasions, I've recorded 2 parts together, and re-recorded the intro and outro, if one part ended up 40 minutes, and one 20, to keep it even.   If, however, something is easy and dull, I'll either skip it or speed it up - whenever I get round to Freeside, I'll probably show it in 3x speed with post commentary to stop it slowing things down."

ManyATrueNerd,2piged,Fishbowl101,3,Tue Dec 16 22:04:52 2014 UTC,"Actually, can somebody tell me, because I'm unclear on this.  I know that going NCR makes the Legion shoot-on-sight, but if I go House and get myself up to +4 positive reputation with the Legion before committing, I assume that would mean;   No Legion hit squads Legion do still shoot on sight (not sure on that one... NCR definitely don't)"
ManyATrueNerd,2piged,ManyATrueNerd,5,Tue Dec 16 23:36:30 2014 UTC,"Jon, you have COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. (9 complete runs between House and Yes Man, the latter of whom follows House's ""ruleset"" where regards how NCR/Legion view the Courier as the questline advances:  Assuming that you do indeed get up to +4 positive (+3/""Liked"" is enough, because Idolized is a huge pain in the arse to get up to:   Legion does shoot on sight.  You're with 'em or against 'em in Caesar's view. There are, however, no Legion hit squads. NCR has no objection to you at all.  You can't go down their main questline anymore, but you can do all sidequests for the NCR (from Forlorn Hope to McCarran to Golf to Bitter Springs) and any NCR-aligned companions (Boone/Cass) will still happily follow the Courier.  This comes in handy when it's time to do You'll Know It When It Happens.   Also:   Rene Auberjonois (House) puts in a tour de force voice acting performance---just imagine House as though Odo from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine decided for reasons unknown to shape-shift into a computer. Along the same lines, and you saw this with the Kill Everything run and all that wonderful dialogue involving Yes Man chiding you for blowing up the Fort bunker, Dave Foley (of Kids in the Hall and NewsRadio fame) is delightful in delivering his lines. And just to finish the obvious thought, John Doman (best known as William Rawls from The Wire) is also excellent as Caesar.  The weak link in voice acting is the NCR, which lacks a great performance."

Advancing further in the House or NCR questlines will piss Legion off, though, even if you have a good rep with them.  Edit: this looks interesting:   If a player's reputation is under vilified, assassins will usually initiate dialogue and can be scared off through a Terrifying Presence dialogue choice. The lead Legionary will ask the Courier, ""Do you ever give up?"" to which the may reply ""Not while there's still spines unshattered."". This will cause them to cry for help, and flee."

ManyATrueNerd,2pdvdf,Sthr33,-2,Tue Dec 16 22:11:58 2014 UTC,"Your reply is worth responding to. Basically, I see House as a psychopath, for lack of a better word. He seems preoccupied with glorifying himself and whoring out the Strip and the rest of the Mojave for largely his own gain. Caesar seems mostly selfless, considering dictatorship not as a means of self glorification but as an axiomatic part of stability. But, I disregard House because in-game I find his quests a boring pastiche of other faction stories with only two new characters to talk to if you side with him."
ManyATrueNerd,2pdvdf,yodafan16,6,Mon Dec 15 23:54:30 2014 UTC,"Fuck the Legion, at least the NCR don't rape and murder innocent people."

But more importantly, Caesar is not the legionaries, he is their only guiding light, so when New Vegas is taken he said the Legion will become fully civilized, so they shall."
ManyATrueNerd,2pdvdf,yodafan16,3,Mon Dec 15 21:10:44 2014 UTC,"However, there seems to be a strong consensus that when Caesar dies (and he's old even if he survives the tumour), the Legion collapses. Even with Caesar, Lanius believes the Legion couldn't hold together if it extended into California.  When that happens, you've got these vicious well-organised murder and rape squads, fragmenting and leaderless all over the US West...  It's not a good scenario."

Couple of quests you could start and then save for later."
ManyATrueNerd,2pacd6,NoOneImportant4,3,Sun Dec 14 20:58:17 2014 UTC,"Yep...Pugilism Illustrated is in that suite.  Not really critical for Jon's current run, since PD Shoot doesn't seem the hand-to-hand combat type, but yes, it is there."
ManyATrueNerd,2pacd6,RealFoxD,4,Sun Dec 14 21:13:48 2014 UTC,"I think Jon's mentioned a few times that he wants a bit into Unarmed so that, in case he ever needs to use a sneak attack critical in melee range, he would have that option.  I believe that's why he keeps the power fist around."

ManyATrueNerd,2pacd6,RealFoxD,8,Sun Dec 14 21:15:09 2014 UTC,"I vote for House, because Jon already did NCR in the No Kill run and said that he likely will do a lot of Legion content in the new Kill Everything run.

Do some legion stuff to get liked to avoid hitsquads (as much as you say you're prepared for them, their jump-out-of-the-woodwork nature would be a problem)  Getting the Remnants to side with the NCR would be a boon, but it def. forces you to go near Cazadore territory which could end poorly."

You need a high-damage, reasonably high rate of fire weapon, and for that, there are a few decent options---brush gun with the .45-70 SWC if Jon ever figures out that Hand Loader's a great perk---his repair was what, 31, did I see that during the last video?  If he insists on not doing repair properly, the next best thing is probably This Machine with .308 AP, or even something like the Marksman Carbine with 5.56mm AP, but that stuff's a lot harder to find.  I'm partial to the 12.7mm SMG with just regular 12.7mm ammo myself."

Couple months ago I decided to go to Bitter Springs at an early level for whatever reason, and I wanted to take a new route there.  So I swam across the entire lake!  That camp ground you saw is actually completely safe; there are baby cazadores a little ways over in a boat landing (right next to where your raise the Lady of the Lake for Loyal), but so long as you're sneaking, they're far enough away they won't see you.  Inside the building at that campground is a star bottle cap and a skill book of some kind...a good one, but I forget which one.  It's guarded by two rats, but they should pose no problem.    I'm kind of curious how you plan to deal with Benny...if I were in your shoes, what I would do is hop on over to the Lucky 38 and head to the cocktail lounge (or whatever it's called).  Inside you will find a briefcase with a hard lock on a table near the windows and inside will be some stuff, but most importantly there should be 3-4 C-4s and a detonator.  When Swank tells you to go check out Benny's room, you could plant the C4 at the bar where Benny will sit, have Swank send him up, and as soon as you come out the elevator, blow him straight to Hell.

ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,AnotherCuriousHuman,4,Fri Dec 5 20:02:20 2014 UTC,Math overruled.
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,BalefirePhoenix,3,Fri Dec 5 23:30:57 2014 UTC,It doesn't really influence me at much - an average video that took a few hours to put together can easily bring in under $6 once things like people with ad-block are factored in.
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Fri Dec 5 23:44:34 2014 UTC,"I might be totally wrong here, so don't set me ablaze, but as far as I know Youtube revenue is measured in the amount of time actually watched in a video vs views. So, for example, in a 10 minute video if someone only watches 4 minutes of that video, the youtuber only makes money for those 4 watched minutes, not the full 10 minutes. I'm not sure if this factors in ads or not. RubberRoss (game grumps) did a video a few months ago about whether or not Youtube is a feasible way of earning an income doing animation, and he explained this ""time watched"" vs actual views and subscribers thing, so check out that video for a better explanation. So, technically, LetsPlayers like Markiplier, PewDiePie, Gamegrumps who put out 2-4 videos a day, some of them 20+ minutes long, will earn money for all the time watched in those videos rather than how many people watched them. Again, my info might be incorrect but this is my current knowledge of how Youtube pays out money."
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,RealFoxD,3,Sat Dec 6 12:04:35 2014 UTC,"I think South Park lost its fastball a long time ago and it's changed from Trey and Matt taking the piss out of American culture in general more toward a BuzzFeed-like ""people are talking about this, let's make something that will go viral"" attitude.  Whether that's executive meddling from Comedy Central or just a sad commentary on the state of what people think is funny these days, I'm out on it."
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,Bookworm12k,2,Sat Dec 6 05:33:02 2014 UTC,I think their late episode last season made them more concerned about churning them out than making it quality.
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,sanguine34,2,Sat Dec 6 18:55:59 2014 UTC,"I personally haven't seen the episode yet but I do watch several different lets players and also watch esports (league of legends specifically but for a different reason). I watch let's plays because I enjoy the personality that is playing the game, not necessarily because I want to watch the game. I like listening to their commentary and their jokes, kind of like a radio station, I usually have YouTube minimized as I'm doing work or playing a different game so I usually don't actually 'watch' let's plays, I just listen to them. Once or twice I've watched let's plays because I wanted to look at what the game is like, or because I didn't have enough money to buy it and I wanted to experience it.   On a similar vein but slightly unrelated, a few people have asked me why on earth would I watch esports, I watch it because I enjoy watching highly skilled players showing their skills and i find it entertaining, just like watching regular sports like football or basketball. The difference between why i watch let's plays and esports is that lets players are not necessarily skilled at games, but they are skilled at entertaining. In esports, players dedicate their lives to being the best at a single game, that is not to say that they are not entertaining, I watch twitch streams of professional league players such as scarra and Bjergsen, both are entertaining but both also give tips on how to play better and are very knowledgeable about the game."
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,Maschinengewehr,2,Sun Dec 7 01:50:03 2014 UTC,"Ive always liked watching other people play games. I remember when i was very young, I'd watch my brothers play and enjoy it more than actually playing myself. Commentary is also pretty nice, as long as it's interesting"
ManyATrueNerd,2oe4yi,Troggie42,1 point,Sat Dec 6 02:06:02 2014 UTC,"Let's plays aren't about the games, they're about the personality.   Although, watching Jon play F03, NV, and also FTL made me buy them all for PC (Fallout was Xbox only for me for a while), so there's that."

ManyATrueNerd,2o1pw8,SolarMechanic,13,Tue Dec 2 14:30:45 2014 UTC,"True, there are simularities - except the DW run deliberately cripples you through no armour and no endurance so it's partly about running away and being under very dangerous fire, whereas No Kill was set up for tanking and I allowed myself armour.  I suppose no armour/hardcore could be fun - that would reduce stimpack abuse and mean you took a LOT of damage and while healing was possible it wouldn't be practical under fire due to the slow healing rate."

ManyATrueNerd,2nynmr,First_Man_on_Uranus,5,Tue Dec 2 06:15:58 2014 UTC,"As near as I can tell, Jon is sorta-kinda role playing as P.D. Shoot.  So, if we put ourselves in P.D. Shoot's shoes:  Sure, the Legion is scary, but they're all the way over there.  I don't see any reason P.D. Shoot would ally with them.  Given the exposure to the NCR and House, Shoot has ample reason to think either of them are a strong contender for ally, but I'm willing to bet that, throughout the course of the game, Shoot is given ample evidence to see that the NCR, while a formidable ally, won't be enough to keep her safe in the long run.  The NCR has too many weaknesses.    House, however, does not have any of the weaknesses the NCR has.  If Shoot were looking for an ally that could keep her out of harm's way, House would be the way to go.  Yes Man is a ""literally who"" option in the eyes of Shoot."

You'll still be shot on sight for failing Beware The Wrath of Caesar, but they won't actively hunt me down..."

ManyATrueNerd,2nynmr,serialphreak,2,Tue Dec 2 02:26:46 2014 UTC,My vote goes to Mister House.

ManyATrueNerd,2nynmr,owenkass,1 point,Wed Dec 3 19:01:51 2014 UTC,Mr. House would be the best bet. Robot Army for the win.
ManyATrueNerd,2nynmr,Pommy356,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:29:19 2014 UTC,"A great way to not take any damage blowing up the bunker is to wear Brotherhood aligned armour, IIRC nothing will shoot you if you wear the power armour or the (cheaper to obtain) scribe robes, you won't be shot by man or turret."
ManyATrueNerd,2nynmr,sirdoctoresquire,1 point,Tue Dec 2 03:45:34 2014 UTC,Mr. House makes the most sense.  NCR as number 2.

ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,JackJDF,34,Sun Nov 30 21:54:02 2014 UTC,The editing of his videos is so good that I struggle to watch playthroughs that aren't like his.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,AfricanRain,4,Sun Nov 30 23:06:14 2014 UTC,"Hey you, bet you've heard of this guy but Will Strifes playthroughs are very well editted. Fallout 3 play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywlbKYMNePg&list=PLn7CSjAPE5FPGKamvTptIr8FjiZZsSpGe"
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,rRue,22,Wed Dec 3 03:23:04 2014 UTC,"I'd like to add to this chorus. My only regret about Many a True November is that I feel so spoiled now, and now I will have to suffer withdraw in December.  Hey, maybe I can watch your Mass Effect videos. I've avoided them before now because I haven't played through 3 yet, and have somehow still avoided spoilers. Are there spoilers?"
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,Daveaa005,8,Sun Nov 30 23:53:12 2014 UTC,"As far as I know he's only done the first, so no spoilers for you."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,Theorex,2,Mon Dec 1 00:20:50 2014 UTC,"There's a tiny tiny thing about the Moon which comes up again in 3, but generally it's only about MW1 itself"
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Mon Dec 1 10:36:45 2014 UTC,No spoilers that I remember. I just finished ME3 last week for the first time.

ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,RedHerringxx,2,Mon Dec 1 05:38:26 2014 UTC,Noooo... it gives us nightmares it does!
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,SuffolksSecretSauce,8,Mon Dec 1 12:44:28 2014 UTC,"Amen. There are quite a few youtubers who moan about how hard it is to put videos out regularly, and for some of them , it's literally their only job. Well done sir."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,Ginsoakedboy21,3,Sun Nov 30 23:52:27 2014 UTC,"How much work you can put out really depends on the person, so I'd not call it ""moaning"" to say that putting full-time hours in youtube is hard for some. It can be."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvmmr,Lolita_Humbert,1 point,Mon Dec 1 02:59:19 2014 UTC,"If it feels like work rather than play, you probably did it right, because that's the sign that you give a crap whether your stuff is any good.  I don't begrudge anyone grumbling about hard work, because let's face it, ""satisfaction of a job well done"" is faint comfort when you're actually doing the job."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,ManyATrueNerd,21,Sun Nov 30 21:43:29 2014 UTC,Oh that was painful. I actually saw the tripwire before you walked across it.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,acksed,17,Sun Nov 30 22:28:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I saw it clear as day in editing too - when I was recording, it was a fairly bright day, so picking out a tripwire in a dark Vault was even harder than usual..."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,RealFoxD,2,Sun Nov 30 23:10:35 2014 UTC,One of the best arguments ever advanced for the Light Step perk.

ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,forgodandthequeen,12,Tue Dec 2 16:48:11 2014 UTC,"Enemies seemingly everywhere, an inability to see what is really going on and a price to be paid in bloodshed? You are recreating the story of Vault 11."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,NoOneImportant4,14,Sun Nov 30 22:13:12 2014 UTC,"Ahahahaha, I jumped at that explosion.  And don't feel bad, I forgot about that shotgun for, like, the first 8 times I went through Vault 11.  That mantis though...that was rough.    You know, if corner are too terrifying, you might think about investing in a grenade rifle.  If you pick up timed grenade rifle ammo, you can bounce grenades around corners.  It's not all that accurate, but you might cripple some legs and I'm sure the enemy's HP bar will show up.  Then again, if you're not fast enough, you might also blow yourself up."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Hanidalon,12,Sun Nov 30 22:57:45 2014 UTC,Don't forget the rebreather gives damage resistance as well and can be worn with hats or the spacesuit helmet.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,abraxo_cleaner,13,Sun Nov 30 23:50:08 2014 UTC,"Oh god Jon these past few weeks have been killing me, please, for the sake of my sanity, repair your weapons! There's no reason your sniper shouldn't be one-shotting mantises with sneak attacks, but your damage goes down so sharply when your guns are in bad shape. As Three Dog says in Fallout 3, ""If your weapon is fallin' apart, the only wasteland asshole it's gonna kill- is YOU.""  Oh, and just to pour salt on the wound, because of how shotguns work with the pellets, if you'd had your combat armor on when the trap tagged you, you'd have taken almost no damage at all, it wouldn't have breached your DT."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,mikeburnfire,9,Mon Dec 1 10:42:48 2014 UTC,"More health lost today than all other episodes combined, and leaving Jon with roughly 75% of his total health.  After going through kill everything and no kill and basically knowing everything about this game, I didn't think he'd ever get tripped up by anything. Yet, I'm really enjoying the frantic panicking and screams of terror."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Yogurt_Huevos,6,Sun Nov 30 23:44:18 2014 UTC,A haiku to summarize:   In Vault 11  Booby traps are abound  60 HP gone

ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Yogurt_Huevos,2,Mon Dec 1 14:52:48 2014 UTC,six-ty H-P gone?  I think that's five...
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,dabisnit,2,Mon Dec 1 16:44:38 2014 UTC,You need 7
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,onaretrotip,2,Mon Dec 1 16:51:20 2014 UTC,Second line.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Yogurt_Huevos,5,Mon Dec 1 16:54:11 2014 UTC,I've always been bad at counting problems...
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,gokism,7,Mon Dec 1 17:08:07 2014 UTC,Why don't you ever repair your weapons?
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,yodafan16,5,Mon Dec 1 02:20:34 2014 UTC,"You should repair the power armor up all the way just to be safe, i noticed you don't do that with your combat armor."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Yogurt_Huevos,4,Mon Dec 1 00:39:18 2014 UTC,"Why?  Once it is past the little dashed line in the center it is at full effectiveness, and anything beyond that is just ""extra"".  If he gets hit enough to where the armor becomes broken, he probably has died."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,yodafan16,2,Mon Dec 1 00:51:34 2014 UTC,"you're right but it just bothers me, he should go get his weapons fixed though and he had the t45d so he could have used that to fix it anyway. I'm just one of the people who fixes my gear whenever i get the chance just because it makes me feel safer."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,PigHaggerty,1 point,Mon Dec 1 04:05:40 2014 UTC,I agree. It pained me to watch him ditch it when it could be used for repairs!
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,misterwinkey,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:47:16 2014 UTC,Noooooo......sell it!
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,AfricanRain,3,Tue Dec 2 16:22:07 2014 UTC,There's no way he's gonna survive the Legion hit squads.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Revelations216,3,Mon Dec 1 01:38:27 2014 UTC,"Must be careful with making sure not to set off particular triggers going down the main quest. I think the best option would be to stop at a particular point during the main quest - such as when you decide who to side with, because that can make the Legion send assassins after you if you're not going down their path. When the DLCs have been done, and if they've been done, he can finish what's left of the game and avoid the places they spawn. It's also important that he brings some Legion armor so he can disguise himself if he catches them approaching.  As long as he avoids the triggers that lower rep with the Legion, they aren't a problem. I'm fairly certain he knows or will look up ways to avoid pissing off the Legion."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,SolarMechanic,3,Mon Dec 1 07:20:31 2014 UTC,"Noticed that so far none of the damage taken has been through direct combat with a human, it been traps and animals. The closest thing was that feral ghoul, which I count as basically an animal."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,AfricanRain,2,Mon Dec 1 04:08:04 2014 UTC,That shotgun scared the piss out of me.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Revelations216,2,Sun Nov 30 23:05:34 2014 UTC,"After the encounter with that mantis, I think it's safe to say you should pour most or all of your points into Sneak when you level up. And pick up the Chinese Spec Ops Training manuals and other skill books, too.   With Silent Running and 100 Sneak, one can crouch walk/run right in front of nearly all enemies (in the base game), and they won't detect you. But this does not work against many DLC enemies."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,falloutjunkie,2,Sun Nov 30 23:47:57 2014 UTC,You can keep the brotherhood around with the NCR if Elder Mac. is still the elder.
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,Nate_the_Ace,2,Mon Dec 1 03:59:53 2014 UTC,You said swum
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,mikeburnfire,4,Mon Dec 1 05:01:02 2014 UTC,"Swum is actually the ""correct"" participle of swim. Swam is only used in past or hypothetical tenses.   Not that English has any established rules to follow, and you won't be misunderstood for saying the other one. But traditionally, that's how it's been."
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,dabisnit,1 point,Mon Dec 1 07:25:56 2014 UTC,I swimmed across the Atlantic ocean to tell Jon how to pronounce coyote
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,edichez,2,Mon Dec 1 16:54:32 2014 UTC,"I sucked in air through my teeth so hard when I saw you walking through the booby trapped door!  Then after the shotgun blast I literally cried, ""No, Jon!"" Then the mantis was icing on the shit cake :( Great episode, though! No one wants to see the hero go through completely unscathed, where's the drama in that? :)"
ManyATrueNerd,2nvlhc,willgameforgold,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:03:18 2014 UTC,"Fantastic as always. And that moment when leaving Vault 11 with the giant mantis in VATS was great, the tense moment where you could've taken even MORE damage from tat vault was extremely tense and cool."

ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,ManyATrueNerd,10,Sun Nov 30 19:56:23 2014 UTC,I'm going to miss Many A True November :(
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,antiutopie,5,Sun Nov 30 20:22:18 2014 UTC,Congratulations on making it through Many A True November! Bloody well done.
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,Bookworm12k,9,Sun Nov 30 20:12:29 2014 UTC,"Hang on, I don't recall a video with a murderous wossname.. Anyone have a link to that? Must've missed it.  On another note, Might I suggest for future polls you might like to use Likes instead of Views? Views can be a bit unreliable versus Likes which only get counted once per person. Or even using Strawpoll which is just absurdly easy to setup."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,EdibleBrains,10,Sun Nov 30 20:14:08 2014 UTC,"Likes is a good idea, but I didn't feel comfortable asking for likes directly - I hate those YouTubers who effectively beg for likes and comments in every video..."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,kolboldbard,2,Sun Nov 30 21:49:16 2014 UTC,"Actually, It would be nice if you reminded me to like the video at the end.   I keep forgetting to hit the like button :-/"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,ROPROPE,15,Tue Dec 2 01:34:45 2014 UTC,"The super-secret surprise option really sounded like a big leap for this channel that could bring along so much more viewers and fans, but I have to admit I voted for Dating Simulator Thursday.  I'm sorry, you just spoke way too convincingly about it :<"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,iLateralGX,8,Sun Nov 30 20:08:48 2014 UTC,I don't blame you. I did the same thing. Uncomfortable Jon is just so good...
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,Anacoluthia,11,Sun Nov 30 21:15:27 2014 UTC,I really like when you play Dating Sims because I'd never enjoy them normally.
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,forgodandthequeen,11,Sun Nov 30 20:02:49 2014 UTC,What the Hell Wednesday was my name idea! A man on the internet said well done to me!
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,XmRyan,16,Sun Nov 30 22:11:19 2014 UTC,50 MATN points to you for naming a series
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,Owl_of_Athena,10,Sun Nov 30 23:11:38 2014 UTC,"I think your challenge runs are where a lot of your best content has come from, so here's to hoping that comes through"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,dabisnit,6,Sun Nov 30 20:06:10 2014 UTC,"As my favourite series (Fallout, FLT and LA Noire) aren't under threat, I have to vote for What the hell Wednesday, as I don't want you to get too burnt out on series and sometimes one-off videos can be the most fun and super easy for newcomers to the channel to get into :)"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,skippythemoonrock,3,Sun Nov 30 21:42:36 2014 UTC,"Really tugging at my heartstrings Jon. I want to criticize you for mispronouncing coyote, but I don't think they'd have one at a zoo. They are pests in America and kill lots of pets.   I Mayhem Monday because I like playing like that too.  But I also liked the idea of streaming as long as it goes better than the first one.  BioShock is one of my favorite games and I like the challenges you have as well for Mass Effect.  So I had to choose both Tuesday and Streaming. I have DeadSpace on Origin but I don't know if I can gift that to you. That would be a fun stream."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,skippythemoonrock,7,Sun Nov 30 21:57:07 2014 UTC,Nothing could ever go better than that first livestream. The art has been perfected.
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,kolboldbard,3,Sun Nov 30 23:11:19 2014 UTC,"So for dating sims, is there a limit on NSFW content?"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,skippythemoonrock,3,Sun Nov 30 22:23:56 2014 UTC,None - though I may have subsequently edit out some things...
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,kolboldbard,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:09:52 2014 UTC,"As someone else has said MONSTER GIRL QUEST, HO! For the record the only not-sketchy place you can find it in english is Piratebay."

ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,TOHSNBN,3,Sun Nov 30 23:39:12 2014 UTC,"Well done Jon! Thanks for the month of great daily content!  I voted for Dating Sim Thursday. And i have a suggestion already:  Katawa Shoujo!  It is a great visual novel! It has adult scenes but these can be exchanged with some pictures of food, in case it gets frisky."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,HetBlik,3,Sun Nov 30 21:03:56 2014 UTC,Personally I enjoy your challenge runs the most so that's where my vote goes. And for that I'd like to suggest a run of MGS3 on its European Extreme difficulty where you lose if the enemies see you.
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,RealFoxD,3,Sun Nov 30 23:46:54 2014 UTC,I'm all about those challenge runs.
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,SWATyouTalkinAbout,2,Mon Dec 1 01:53:17 2014 UTC,"As much as i love watching the dating sim videos, it has to be ""What The Hell Wednesday"", just look at the voting video.  Your IRL videos are by far my favorite."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,SykoKiller666,2,Sun Nov 30 20:38:21 2014 UTC,"I'd love to see Jon make more Mayhem Monday and What the hell Wednesday, both are very entertaining and funny to watch.   I find Dating simulator Thursday personally somewhat boring. I tried to watch some of it but even Jon can't make it interesting enough, I keep falling asleep while watching it and thus can't really follow the series.   I'm kind of on the fence about streaming, it depends on how it is done. On one hand it maybe very fun to see Jon play live and interact with it. On the other hand, only a part of the audience may be able to see it due to the differences in time zone or time planning."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,AfricanRain,2,Sun Nov 30 21:33:08 2014 UTC,"I put my quarter* down for What the Hell Wednesday.  Let's Play Vegetable Risotto is my favourite non-Fallout video on the channel.  *not actual quarter, but after I move into a new place next month and get my money situation sorted I plan to find some $ in the budget for Patreon support for my favourite content creators...keep up the good work, Jon!"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,JackJDF,2,Sun Nov 30 21:41:18 2014 UTC,"It seems the opinion of the masses is dating simulator, but I like Challenge Tuesday best. That's what originally got me interested in your channel, and I feel it's a very important part that needs to stay."
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,madmutant01,4,Mon Dec 1 07:01:33 2014 UTC,"Let's compromise. FTL Livestream Friday, and Dating Simulator Thursday. Deal?"
ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,edichez,3,Sun Nov 30 23:50:56 2014 UTC,Dating Sim for me. More hunky boys

ManyATrueNerd,2nv9yc,iiRockpuppy,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:46:11 2014 UTC,I'd agree with livestream but due to my schedule I' not be available to watch it so I'd love it if you kept doing highlights on them.

ManyATrueNerd,2nsbat,antiutopie,3,Sun Nov 30 00:02:00 2014 UTC,I don't understand what this guys motive was? A murder would need a pretty strong one. Did I miss something?
ManyATrueNerd,2nsbat,SolarMechanic,4,Sat Nov 29 22:28:46 2014 UTC,I just saw that L.A. Noire is currently 75 % off on steam. Since I couldn't resist I thought I share this information with other interested viewers if MATNs run

How could he possibly not have been the killer?!"

Have some Lanius board the enemy by teleporting into their oxygen generator. They'll drain the room and destroy the generator.   Then you just keep them stationed there enemy crew will run in to kill the intruders but eventually stop because they'll die from asphyxiation.  Eventually all the crew dies because they either waited it out and died due to a lack of oxygen or they ran in and gotten themselves killed by your Lanius.  Works even better with mind control and a well placed hacking drone."

At some point, I'd love to go part-time because this is wonderful work with a great community, and Patreon is part of allowing me to do that, along with growing the channel, and generally just getting myself financially secure.

Fortunately, the BoS safehouse has them. The Boomer munitions manager also sells them as long as you are Accepted by the Boomers, and a good way to do that is to give Raquel missiles."
ManyATrueNerd,2n6zrg,acksed,18,Sun Nov 23 21:28:32 2014 UTC,They're also easy to make - Novac is full of the right materials
ManyATrueNerd,2n6zrg,acksed,2,Sun Nov 23 21:32:05 2014 UTC,"If you are considering crafting, and need to take on Cazadores or Nightstalkers, please please please consider crafting some snakebite tourniquets. Components're absurdly easy, just surgical tubing and buffalo seed gourds."
ManyATrueNerd,2n6zrg,RealFoxD,12,Mon Nov 24 16:38:21 2014 UTC,"I'm a huge, HUGE believer in getting up to Repair 90 and getting the Jury Rigging perk.  The sniper rifle can be repaired with NCR Service Rifles, which if you follow the ""snipe off NCR cannon fodder to give their dogtags to the Legion"" strategy of preventing Legion hit squads (see last week's discussion threads for my take on that), makes service rifles very plentiful.  Plus, on the way to 90 is Repair 70 and the Hand Loader perk, which no Guns build should ever be without.  .308 JSP in that sniper rifle is a great all-purpose round."
ManyATrueNerd,2n6zrg,NoOneImportant4,4,Sun Nov 23 23:16:54 2014 UTC,"I used to be like you and thought that Jury Rigging was a really good perk.  The more play throughs I did, however, the more I realized that Jury Rigging is a wasted perk.  If you look for it, you can find materials to make weapon repair kits all over the Wastes.  Even without searching DLC areas, you could make over 100 WRK I'm sure.  And, if you include DLC, you get infinite WRK from Dead Money through the vending machine.  So you never need to repair your weapons through conventional means.  For armor, you can simply have one of the vendors with 100 Repair repair it for you since caps are not hard to come by.  You could always break all the banks, turn in all the snowglobes, and if that still isn't enough, the DLCs offer loads and loads of caps, more than you could ever hope to spend.  So between nigh unlimited WRK and repairing vendors, what purpose could Jury Rigging serve other than, perhaps, saving a bit of time out in the field?  A bit of time that could be saved through a modicum of planning and repairing before hand.  Hand Loader is still pretty good though, but I feel Jury Rigging is a waste."
ManyATrueNerd,2n6zrg,RealFoxD,6,Mon Nov 24 01:47:11 2014 UTC,"Here's my defense of the Jury Rigging perk:  If you play in Hardcore Mode, it frees up your carry weight, which is important especially if you don't use companions.  Since you're often juggling crafting supplies and ammo in HC while still trying at least in the transition-to-midgame (*I tend to do a ton of quests and hit level 14 roughly around the same time I get to Freeside) to cart off enough loot to go through the upgrade progression, that's one less thing you have to worry about as far as keeping an efficient build is concerned.  When ammo is weightless and stimpaks (which are also weightless) heal instantly, I can see the argument against JR, but from where I'm sitting, max condition is a very powerful part of my character build.  (Aside) I play with JSawyer.esp on PC.  Just to underscore the above.  Not relevant to Jon (or most New Vegas players) but gives a little added insight into my mindset.  I might try doing without it in my next playthrough just to see how it goes (especially since as my skill with the game is much, much higher than it was when I set my ""preferred build"", and fixing armour isn't as critical as it once was since I much more rarely take damage), but right now with a level cap of 50 in vanilla and 35 in JSawyer, I just can't think of 25 (or 17) other perks I want more than Jury Rigging.  Great post, BTW.  Just goes to show how many perfectly valid ways there are to play this game.  Cheers, mate."
ManyATrueNerd,2n6zrg,NoOneImportant4,2,Mon Nov 24 02:28:33 2014 UTC,"Mm, I've not had the pleasure of playing JSawyer's mod.  I only recently bought NV for Steam, and to be honest, I'm something of a moron when it comes to technology.  The thought of modding New Vegas leaves me more than a little terrified.  As far as it goes though, I may have exaggerated a bit.  Jury Rigging's hardly the worst perk one can take."

If you get your aim and your AP up high enough, you can VATS + sneak attack crit the wings of Cazadores and term them into harmless little crawling babbies.  Only need to cripple one wing, and one shot with the Sniper Rifle is enough, I find.  If you come across enough caps, you might consider upgrading to a silenced Anti-Material Rifle.

If this were in this universe however and I were the detective I know I'd have to live with my murky grey decision if I sent someone to prison I felt wasn't the right guy. The fact that a pedo is off the streets and a teen has a dad to come home to instead of a relative/foster care (especially since the kid senses her dad had something to do with her mom's murder) is of little solace."

ManyATrueNerd,2n3h2x,Pandabarrel,2,Sat Nov 22 21:50:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've been taking pains not to read anything about LA Noire online because I honestly don't know how the story turns out and having it (relatively) unspoilt allows me to enjoy Jon's videos more.  On the other hand, I may very well have played more New Vegas than Jon has (over 1,100 hours, according to Steam) and I like those vids just fine."
ManyATrueNerd,2n2bav,XenoCivie,20,Sat Nov 22 07:20:25 2014 UTC,"It's added a fair bit on, but I've chosen the series carefully so it's not too bad.  The most important thing is that each series takes a different amount of time. In general, I have a record a different amount of time per game to get what I estimate will be a part of 20-25 minutes, which is what I aim for. Once I have that footage, the editing will take about as long as the footage is.  Things like FTL, Nicole, and challenges likes Bioshock are time-efficient - I record for an hour and get around an hour of footage, because there's not much to cut out, meaning the editing is also easy.  Things like Red Faction and Fallout are harder work - there's a lot of traveling, menus, etc that gets cut out. I might record for 90 minutes and only get a single 25 minute part.  LA Noire can be even worse, at 2 hours+ recording for one part. LA Noire is also fairly intensive editing to pick out the crucial bits from the interrogations.  Back when I did Fallout Kill Everything, that was easily 3 hours of recording for one part, sometimes only 20 minutes long.  Far Cry 4 has made things easier too - as a new game, you want to leave most things in, so that's time efficient.  On that basis, many of the new series I've brought in aren't that bad, but it's definitely not sustainable, hence why from the start of December it has to go down a bit."
ManyATrueNerd,2n2bav,ManyATrueNerd,10,Sat Nov 22 11:19:50 2014 UTC,"I personally think that the ones that you spend the most time editing are the best ones. I've watched all your Fallouts since Vegas No-kill, and LA Noire has been a series that I didn't think I would like, but find myself eagerly anticipating! Thanks for putting so much effort in."
ManyATrueNerd,2n2bav,mikeburnfire,0,Sat Nov 22 14:09:55 2014 UTC,"You can edit less on red faction if you don't goof off as much and just play a bit smarter. I love that series but it can get a bit annoying with the constant deaths and getting nothing done in one video. its a pretty long game too so you might want to do a bit more each video. Whatever you decide to do ill keep watching, keep up the good work Jon."

We can tweak and adjust as needed.  CPU: Top of the line i7. Great for gaming and rendering. Non-k chip, meaning it's locked and can't be overclocked. Considering your professed lack of technical aptitude, not worrying about overclocking is probably the way to go. The Intel stock cooler is also more than adequate, so you won't need an aftermarket cooler.  Motherboard: Solid budget motherboard. Nothing special, but has all the features you'd really need. Also, very inexpensive, so that's always nice.  RAM: Standard 8 gigs. Good speed and value. I chose one stick of RAM because the motherboard only supports up to 16 gigs and this way you can easily stick another 8 gigs in later without having to scrap the old RAM.   SSD: You want an SSD. You need an SSD. The single best ""quality of life"" addition you can put in your computer. Everything will run and feel super smooth and snappy. 256 gigabytes is the sweet spot for size and value right now and will allow you to put the operating system, your programs, and a few games that you're actively playing on it. The Crucial MX100 is probably the best bang for buck SSD on the market right now.  The 2TB hard drive will give you lots of space for saving videos and other things you don't need to put on your ssd. You can bump it up to 3TB for about twenty dollars more.  GPU: A monster of a video card. Nvidia's new 900 line is amazing in terms of value, speed, and efficiency. The 970 is easily the best bang for buck video card on the market. MSI's gaming version of the 970 is overclocked out of the box and has an excellent cooler. You will love the performance of this card. Nvidia cards also support ShadowPlay, their proprietary game capture software. This will allow you to easily play and record games with no, or negligible, performance loss.  Case: You can go a lot of different directions here. I chose this case because it is inexpensive while also looking good and having high end features, such as front panel usb 3.0 inputs and good cooling. Let me know what features are important to you and we can change this to fit your needs.  Power Supply: You never ever want to skimp on the power supply, and this is one of the best PSU's you can get for the price. It has an 80+ bronze rating, so it's very efficient, and the internals are actually made by Seasonic, one of the premier names in power supplies. The only downside is that it is not modular, meaning it has all the cables permanently attached, which can be a bit of a pain when doing the cable management. It's really not that big of a deal though. It just requires a little bit more work to run the cables nicely.  I didn't add an operating system, and if you need that you'll have to add ~$100 to the budget. I also did this with the American version of pcpartpicker because you set the budget with American dollars. We can change this to UK pricing easily if you want to. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. This is just a jumping off point, and we can definitely tweak everything here to better fit your budget and your needs."

There are many people on /r/buildapc who know a lot more than I do, so if you were to make a thread there with that build, and tell them what you're hoping to do with it, along with your budget, they could fine-tune it to be perfect.

Also, if MATN has the time, a black Friday/cyber Monday deal might be able to shave $50-$100 off the price."

I know the psu I linked regularly goes on sale for about $25, so there's $30 off the cost there. He can also get a decent ssd the same size for $20-$30 less. A different 970 could shave about that amount off the budget too. There are definitely ways to tighten the budget up a little bit here and there to cover the cost of Windows and I'll keep an eye out and link any good sales I see."

ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,spdbump08,4,Tue Nov 18 08:12:19 2014 UTC,"I would tend to agree with you about the ram, but that's something that can easily be added in later with a little bit of extra funds. It doesn't have to get put in the initial build. As for the processor, personally I would feel weird about having an unlocked chip and not overclocking, but you're right, the k version is a little faster out of the box. He should go with it if he can squeeze it in the budget."

Otherwise, solid machine."

It's the easiest upgrade in the world to add another stick of RAM in a month or so when he has extra money.   That power supply is good. There's nothing wrong with it. It's actually just a rebranded Seasonic psu, which is one of the very best psu makers in the world.   Good call on the fans. I believe that case comes with just one, so he's going to want to throw at least one more in there. The reviews on the case itself are very good for the price. It's a solid budget case.

They're more expensive, and not quite so popular in the low-mid end, but they work a lot better for transcoding + gaming in my experience. AMD works better when it can push the render to the GPU.  That at least was my experience a couple years ago."

ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,spdbump08,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:15:39 2014 UTC,"I'd say it's not that bad, my laptop I use for gaming was £750 and can run Battlefield 3 at Medium, some high settings 30fps. With a desktop you'd be able to get better prices so I'd imagine you'd get a lot better quality than Current Gen(Xbox One, PS4, Wii U ETC.) at the least, though this is going off my performance in BF3 so it will differ. My laptops also 3 years old so hardware might have decreased in price for it's quality."

However, if you are completely limited to ~$1000/£650, then attempt to build a PC with lots of room to upgrade (newer CPU socket, newer chipset etc) so you can buy better parts later."

ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,First_Man_on_Uranus,2,Tue Nov 18 00:24:14 2014 UTC,"I think so, particularly for the CPU. For rendering, it's pretty much a rule of thumb to get an i7 because of the benefits of hyperthreading. So saving up just a little longer will have better long term benefits, and will be better for recording as a good side effect."

If you want to use your wireless xbox 360 controllers with the PC, you need a USB wireless receiver, which used to be available by itself but isn't anymore; to get one, you can either buy a ""xbox controller for pc"" - http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows/dp/B004QRKWKQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416305410&sr=8-1&keywords=xbox+controller+pc+wireless - which comes with the receiver - or, there are a bunch of knockoff receivers on amazon and ebay. remember that the wireless controller itself is exactly the same for ""xbox"" or ""pc"" - the only difference is the receiver."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,Yogurt_Huevos,2,Tue Nov 18 10:14:06 2014 UTC,"Here's a suggestion out of left-field. This month get a good gaming rig for $1000. In two month's time get another. Dual-boot them into a Beowulf cluster and do the rendering there. For light rendering tasks you can use one while gaming on the other, or Claire can use the spare. You can also link the old PC into the cluster if it's worthwhile. I have no idea if this is a worthwhile use of your available funds, it may be that the advantages from clustering are not as great as spending a few more dollars on a single CPU, but it would be great fun."

CPU:  The unlocked i7 will serve you well in content creation (with 4 cores/8 threads or logical cores).  If you want to save a few bucks and invest it somewhere else (such as better GPU or storage), then step down to an i5 or AMD 83xx series of CPUs.  I'll post a build with an AMD 8350 to give a comparison bellow.  CPU cooler:  Bang for the buck.  If you don't plan on overclocking, then we can step down to a non-unlocked (non-k) CPU and remove the cooler and reallocate the funds.  Motherboard:  Good value motherboard that supports overclocking with not too many extra features.  It should server you just fine.  Memory:  16 GB to give you a little more room for content creation and ultimate internet browsing.  Storage:  A 1 TB drive is plenty of room for games and is from a good reliable brand.  I have used these drives in every single one of my builds and only had one that was DOA, but that could have been from the shipping process itself.  GPU:  One of the best value cards on the market.  It will play most games on ultra and the rest on at least high at 60 FPS.  I can personally vouch for this card since I own an AMD 7970 which this card, an AMD 280X, is a rebranded 7970.  Case:  Basic case with few extras.  Went a little cheap in this department.  Power Supply:  Well reviewed and provides enough power for system.  Optical drive:  Optional really, remove if not needed.  OS:  Windows 8.1 because it's good at what it does despite what people seem to say.

Is also somewhat overclockable in case you decide to overclock in the future but not so much so that it made the board a lot more expensive. it also has 8 USB ports on the back some of the H81 intel motherboards only came with 4 (which in my personal experience you run out of ports very quickly.) and is overall a very solid motherboard.  RAM: Mushkin makes very good ram, honestly going single channel on a video editing rig is a very bad idea, while in gaming only single channel is used when video editing it uses dual channel (Basically both Sticks of ram have their own highway of bandwith) really well. the board also supports up to 32 GB. SSD: I agree strongly with yogurt and /u/spdbump08 here although I strongly disagree with his motherboard and ram choice, its more tailored to gaming then rendering and editing.  HDD: This is a strong performing drive, the seagates are solid as well, it depends on how much storage you plan on using.  GPU: The 970 is an absolute monster. also AMD is great for their value right now, but nVidia Shadowplay is great for recording gaming footage as it compresses the video and keeps it in very high quality.  Case: one of my favorite cases under 70 bucks in the US lots of features nice windowed side panel and good airflow.  PSU: a really solid silverstone PSU with some extra room for upgrades in the future.  overall this will be a very solid build. to be honest though VAT and other retailer costs make it much more expensive to build here then in the US. a similar system here costs about $900. I did mention that I would ship most of the stuff that is cheaper over here to you and get you better deals. things like the case and heavy items would end up costing more but things like the CPU, RAM SSD would be a lot cheaper over here."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,SolarMechanic,1 point,Sat Nov 22 17:43:32 2014 UTC,"I tend to put together part lists over on http://pcpartpicker.com/ to make sure parts are compatible, since that's part of how the site works. In the top right, you can change it to UK so it'll switch to British Pounds Sterling.  I'd recommend an Intel i7 4790 or 4790K, and if you can grab it, an Nvidia 900 series(970 will last you a good while). 8 GB of ram is a fine start and can be upgraded later if absolutely necessary, and go for a mid-tower case at least unless you plan to add additional graphics cards for SLI, as anything smaller than a mid would be way too cramped regardless.  Power supply would be best at least 650 watts or more, and look for a modular if you can. Saves power.  Windows 7 OS, 64 bit. Windows 8 is crap tier from all the stories I've heard when it comes to what is going to be purely a gaming, recording, and editing rig for its main goal.  A solid state drive would be good; probably a 120 gigabyte or 250/256 gig would be good. Accompany this with a 1 TB harddrive at the minimum, possibly bigger/more than 1 HDD since you'll be video editing/recording in good quality. Solid State, if you don't know, is really good for installing your operating system and a few important programs to, but isn't the greatest for constantly reading/writing new files to all the time. As I always tell people, it's not the kind of storage to keep your porn on.  Look into your motherboard and make sure it supports what you feel you will need. USB 3.0 Headers is a good idea if you can, and SLI support just in case you upgrade down the line. Get some other folks advice on that as well, since I'm not the best when it comes to finding good MOBOs.  Hope that helps."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,sleek_design,2,Tue Nov 18 00:26:10 2014 UTC,"Windows 8 is better than 7 in almost every way. Plus you can make it look like classic Windows so you don't have to use the tile interface. Microsoft is also ending mainstream support of Windows in a couple months so it would be crazy to make a new build using 7. A 650 watt power supply is overkill for single gpu setups and underpowered for 2 or more graphics cards. There's really no reason to get 650w. I've also never heard of a modular power supply saving power. Do you have a source? I wouldn't worry about SLI either. It's a bit of a headache for those not technically inclined. Good recommendations on the processor, ssd, and pcpartpicker though."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,joelmooner,1 point,Tue Nov 18 04:09:16 2014 UTC,"Sorry; modular isn't for power, but moreso helps avoid clutter since cables can be removed if they aren't being used. It's useful, especially in a new build from someone who is new to building.  I'm not really recommending SLI, but just pointing out SLI support as something to still keep an eye out for, just so he has the option in the end.  Windows 7 is still a great operating system, but that is a good point. While I'm not one to preach Microsoft as a great company, having support for an OS is still important."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,sleek_design,1 point,Tue Nov 18 23:54:22 2014 UTC,"Definitely. Modular psu's are very handy, but not a necessity. I think he's having a friend build it though, someone who's more experienced, so he should be fine either way. I like Windows 7 a lot too. It's my favorite version of Windows ever. I just wouldn't put it on a brand new build because of Microsoft ending support soon. Thanks for clearing up some of those thoughts."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,SolarMechanic,0,Wed Nov 19 00:04:52 2014 UTC,"I really don't think that rendering and recording will really be a possibility without a very beefy system. Video software will use any and all CPU cores that you have, and if trying to play a game during that you will probably have very poor performance.  What kind of system do you have now that you are making your videos with?"
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,SuperM737,1 point,Mon Nov 17 23:52:27 2014 UTC,"I could manage if mid-tier was still doable while rendering - when you say beefy, what total price are you roughly thinking to get good performance on AAA games while rendering?  And the current system is a rather-weak 5-year old thing, don't even worry about that."
ManyATrueNerd,2mlwte,joelmooner,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:09:32 2014 UTC,"Gaming without too much performance loss while rendering is a pretty high demand.  Unless you do something like limit the resources your rendering program is allowed to use, it will try to use everything your system has to offer. Most editing programs will allow you to set the max CPU and RAM allowed to be used, so say you have a 4 core CPU, you can set the max usage to 3 leaving one core for whatever you're doing."

It's why i'm following more independent animation companies, some of them are putting out really wonderful stuff, and Pixar and Disney keep spouting out the same CGI princess stories.

I'm a children's/young adult librarian, so I'm invested in the interests of young people, and I studied film as an undergrad, so I appreciate the medium as a form of high-quality artistic storytelling. It always bothers me when people look down on animation as a lesser form of art, saying that it's ""just for kids."" Great animation is not just for kids, it's for everyone, and even stuff that is made with kids in mind should still be made with care and appreciated equally.  Ok, I'll get off my soapbox now. :P"

It's more of just an emphasized version of clumsy, regarding movements that are quick and jerky. For example, when you're next driving in LA Noire, try turning the wheel back and forth very quickly, and watch Cole's hands. That's spastic"
ManyATrueNerd,2m7j2i,Holyrapid,4,Thu Nov 13 20:14:57 2014 UTC,"In the United States, ""spastic"" is not an offensive term. It seems in the UK it was used to not so kindly refer to someone with cerebral palsy, but this was never the case in the US. For Americans it is a casual term to refer to someone who is poorly coordinated, jumpy, or has more energy than they know what to do with.  Interesting, though, how a word can have such hugely different connotations depending on where you are."

Then, since we missed hot beverages we could stir milk into, rather than drinking our tea with milk, which would require us to admit we were wrong, something no American is capable of doing to a citizen of a foreign nation-state, we instead chose to drink coffee, which tastes like boiled charcoal and needs a good dose of cream to make it palatable.

Or out in the streets, as is more the case with BS:I - these are people you know and love, people you'd give the shirt off your back to help them keep warm in winter.  Then suddenly, out of nowhere, you're overwhelmed with a surging emotion. A desire to kill them. More than a desire, an uncontrollable impulse. But you can feel yourself thinking ""This isn't me! I don't want to do this! Help me!"" as your hand instinctively pulls out your gun, and bang, you're opening fire on your own friends, while inside you're helpless (to use an old term - you have no mouth but you must scream.)  Eventually, that uncontrollable surge ends, you feel your body being returned to yourself, the gun still in your hand, smoking at the barrel. You've just murdered your friends. In public. In cold blood.  You could scream that it wasn't you, you were possessed, but who is going to believe you? And in a pretty brutal enforced society like Columbia, you're going to be found guilty without hesitation.  Why delay the inevitable?

ManyATrueNerd,2li5dl,cinocu,8,Fri Nov 7 19:28:08 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed this one.  It's a stupid plot line in the game but the commentary is fantastic!  Yes, American universities are stupid.  You have to remember two things.  American universities are ""for profit"" companies.  They are there to make money.  They cram in the most amount of students possible for the least amount of money spent (while grabbing the most amount of money possible from students).  The second thing to remember is that most American lower education facilities are rubbish.  Many people come into college without a good basic education.  Most colleges require quite a few credits in General Education.  Most of it is stuff that you should have learned in High School.  Those include science, math, English composition, History, an art class, etc...  Almost all college degrees require the same general credits.  One of the big ones, for any degree, is Organic Chemistry/Biology.  You usually take these General Education courses in your first two years, then the second two years you take classes that are actually related to your major.  A lot of students live on property, especially for the first year or two.  They almost always live in double dorm rooms.  A lot of times, they are quads.  Two bedrooms with two beds in each, with a shared common room and bathroom."
ManyATrueNerd,2li5dl,Calmiche,11,Fri Nov 7 04:31:26 2014 UTC,"Hmm, but if you can spend two years of university just doing general education stuff, doesn't that mean you can end up in a huge amount of  debt just learning stuff that your high school should have taught you?  Given the amount of debt we're talking about, I'm amazed US students and parents aren't rioting on the streets demanding improvements and investment in lower education..."
ManyATrueNerd,2li5dl,davidp1522,6,Fri Nov 7 09:46:18 2014 UTC,I remember that my high school recommended getting general education credits at some cheap community collage to save money if possible.
ManyATrueNerd,2li5dl,Bookworm12k,2,Fri Nov 7 13:00:22 2014 UTC,It is getting better. They're pushing Algebra and even Geometry into middle school so high school students can take more higher math classes and get college credits like Calculus and Statistics.
ManyATrueNerd,2li5dl,Owl_of_Athena,4,Fri Nov 7 20:25:10 2014 UTC,"We start losing subjects very early in the UK. You have to do english/maths/science up to the age of 16 but from the age of 14 history, geography, languages etc are all optional (you just have to take a certain amount).  Then from 16 you only take 3 or 4 subjects, and again you choose, so you can drop maths and science altogether if you like from 16 onwards.   Then finally at uni (Scotland being an exception I believe) we take one subject for either 3 or 4 years, and only do modules that fall under that degree title.  It's not a perfect system as you end up making serious life choices at 14, 16 and 18 which are so young really, but then I don't think the American system is perfect either. For example lots of vocational jobs require you to go to uni (whilst completing completely unrelated topics like geology) and then do several MORE years of grad school afterwards whereas here you'd be qualified after finishing your degree."

ManyATrueNerd,2l33ky,Ilidsor,10,Mon Nov 3 19:03:22 2014 UTC,"I was just doing this quest and the three vaults aren't all that hard. Vault 11 has nothing but rats/giant mantises (mantis's? manti?), Vault 3 requires no fighting whatsoever once you're inside (sniping got me in pretty easily past the fiends), and in Vault 22 you can skip mostly everything by fixing the elevator and knowing what floors you need to be on and you can easily dodge the spit of those plant things. The spore carriers are a problem but they are pretty easy to snipe if you see them.  And I noticed in the gambling scene you didn't get the Naughty Nightwear which gives you +1 luck. Do you not know about that or did you just think you didn't need it?  Ninja Edit: The Vault 11 part of my comment assumes you won't  be finishing the vault just grabbing the components."

ManyATrueNerd,2l33ky,forgodandthequeen,10,Sun Nov 2 23:22:31 2014 UTC,"I would go for Hardin. Taking out the Van Graffs is infinitely easier than taking out the Fiends, evil plants, all the traps in Vault 11 and Black Mountain.(Remember you can let the suicide bomber into the Silver Rush)  Yes, you lose the ability to reconcile the Brotherhood with the NCR, but stealth kills are so easy in this game you should be able to manage to take them all out. Maybe put some points into Unarmed to make good use of the Paladin Toaster(which does shock damage) found in Black Rock Cave.  Edit: And if you are going to kill the Brotherhood, why not do the Mr House route? Because we have already seen you do an NCR run you see."
ManyATrueNerd,2l33ky,JackJDF,5,Sun Nov 2 19:54:01 2014 UTC,Or he could do the wildcard ending so he wouldn't have to get rid of the brotherhood and could still make Hardin the leader
ManyATrueNerd,2l33ky,forgodandthequeen,3,Sun Nov 2 20:00:18 2014 UTC,Indeed. A shame the ability to get old Housie cosy with the Brotherhood was cut.
ManyATrueNerd,2l33ky,Flashpoint_Rowsdower,6,Sun Nov 2 20:01:58 2014 UTC,He wouldn't have to fight the Fiends. Passing a speech check makes all of the enemies in vault 3 non hostile.

The 3 vaults can all potentially be done without taking damage.  It's not like you have to go into Vault 34 or anything.  Vault 3 you'll have to deal with the Fiends on the outside, which is do-able through sniping.  You can complete Aba Daba Honeymoon there as well.  Vault 22 has the spore creature variants which can be taken out from a distance for the most part and also has the added XP bonus of completing There Stands the Grass and the first part of Bleed Me Dry.    Vault 11 has close quarters combat against mantises and rats, but that shouldn't be tough with a decent SMG.  As long as you stay away from the end room you should be fine.  Come on, Jon.  Don't take the coward's way out of Still in the Dark."

I would love watching you create the most diabolical prison imaginable.  Edit:  Nvrm I just went ahead and googled the system requirements  intel core duo(2) (which i'm fairly sure you have if you're going pump out daily videos in november)  4 GB ram  nvidia 8600/radeon equivalent (Intel HD 4000-4400 could probably AFAIK)  and finally the most demanding requirement:  100mb of hard drive space
ManyATrueNerd,2kln0e,TurtleBlastX,9,Tue Oct 28 22:07:13 2014 UTC,Aha - already planned - keep an eye out in November :)

ManyATrueNerd,2kln0e,dabisnit,14,Tue Oct 28 22:16:22 2014 UTC,"A no guns run of Bioshock could prove interesting. You would be relegated to using plasmids, wrench, and the crossbow to fight. A no kill run of dishonored would always be welcome. A run of Morrowind with only Hand-to-hand, defensive/non-damage causing spells would be difficult. To make it even harder you could only use unarmored. Morrowind can be slow though."

It's a relatively open ended FPS RPG game with huge amounts of player choice, an interesting plot, and it would definitely run on MATN's computer without a hitch, guaranteed. You can even get through the whole game without killing anyone.  In a somewhat similar vein, I think STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl would make an incredibly interesting game to watch, though I'm not as sure it's a game Jon would enjoy it or that his computer would run it."

And in Episode 2, there is an achievement for escort a garden gnome through the entire thing, and we all know how much you love gnomes.  Put me down for wanting you to play all of Half-life 2, and its two episodes. And since the game is like, 10 years old, should run fine on your computer."

Alternatively, how about the classic Resident Evil games, Chibi-Robo, Zelda: Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness, Pikmin, Viewtiful Joe, Beyond Good and Evil, Tales of Symphonia or Baten Kaitos?  Failing any of those, what other retro consoles do you have available? I'm only suggesting Gamecube games because I know you already have one."

I've got my fingers crossed for those.   If you can get hold of it, Conker's Bad Fur Day would make for a good set of videos on the N64, as would the Zelda games, GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark and Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon.   Come on, give us a little hint... :)"

The differences between Conker on the N64 and Xbox are negligible, so I suppose for recording purposes the Xbox version would be better (it's not the 360 though, so I don't think it'd be HD). I'd miss the swearing that's been bleeped in for the Xbox version though...  The Xbox version is a lot easier and cheaper to get your hands on, though."

This would be Randomizing RPG games. Now what do I mean by this? Well, the best example I could give is this Tumblr page of a randomized Mass Effect playthrough:  http://arkady-svidrigailov.tumblr.com/tagged/randomized-mass-effect[1]  If you didn't want to check that, basically, you get yourself some dice, and every dialogue option and level-up option will be completely random. This will result in horribly de-balanced characters, decisions and consequences that make absolutely no sense, and an overall really whackjob character. I think ManyATrueNerd is probably one of the few LP'ers that could make this work, as he constantly edits in his LP's, which would make this challenge a lot less tedious to watch as he's going through the dialogue options. Also, I'm not saying which RPG's I'd like to see him play in this randomized style, but Dragon Age definitely has a lot of choices, both in story, and level-up/character customization."

You play a janitor sent into Santa's workshop to clear the place up after he's gone mental and killed everyone inside. It's a pretty unique kind of game with a lot of humor and a bunch of cool things to do in a fairly small space.

I know there are a few times in the game when you are forced to use one, so ""no guns"" isn't an option for the entire playthrough, but I think you could get through the majority of it using only bombs, shivs, bricks/bottles, and the bow. It would definitely be tricky--stealth would be essential, and you'd have to constantly gather ingredients. It'd be challenging, but interesting.  Or you could just do a playthrough on the Grounded difficulty, which has no HUD. I can't imagine how hard it would be to go through the game without knowing your health status!

And some other junk too; but mainly that Edit: i would also love to see, more than anything from you, a no kill run of fallout 3. Its my favorite video game ever, i like it so much more than new vegas, skyrim, far cry, cod, you name it. I love watching you play it because, somehow, i know the game better than you do which makes me feel accomplished. I know you have to kill ONE MEASLY RADROACH and some poor poor super mutants, but other than those two things, both of which your father put you up to, you don't ever really have to kill anyone or anything. And of course, some backstory: ""when i turned 10, my father handed me a gun and said 'jon, you're gonna kill that poor, defenseless critter' which traumatized me. Now, i live in the wasteland and its so very hard because i'd lose it if i killed anything! Its so morally wrong!""

Not sure whether it's a good enough game for you to complete, as it's fairly linear.  Indie game wise, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. Again I'm not sure this game will fit your normal favorites, but it's a very odd/very well done game that can be really addicting, fun, and has an insane amount of replay value. Also great for streams, as a single game can range around an hour, so it's easy to schedule.  Last but not least, more GTA V or Mass Effect...or how about Fable 2?

By the end my character had giant blue veins from magic over-use and horns sprouting from his head. He was also quite obese based on his eating habits.  Play 2 I made every positive/good/right decision. Only used melee weapons and ate vegetables, etc. By the end my character was followed everywhere by a halo and had a giant powdered wig.

ManyATrueNerd,2kdzqg,forgodandthequeen,16,Sun Oct 26 18:37:36 2014 UTC,"Not a chance - some of them I never edited, so they're very scruffy.  I will say that they tended to be dark and slightly surreal comedies set in various alternate universe Great Britains. For some reason, variations on that setting always appealed.  I used to do a lot more writing, but I've found the channel really fulfills my creative itch, so I haven't done much the last year, so I want to do something Nano-ish, at least."

ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,ManyATrueNerd,10,Sun Oct 26 20:18:48 2014 UTC,"Can't believe I'm actually going to make my first reddit post...  In response to this latest episode, I decided to see if it was possible to reach the Boomers without taking any damage (since the cannon barrage will stop if you reach them), and I have successfully done it.  It might come as a surprise to some, but there is more than one path leading into Boomer territory.  You have the road with the betting man (whose name escapes me), there are also some train tracks next to the road you can use.  I don't advise taking the train tracks.  The third way is through a train tunnel.  If you go to Raul's house and follow the mountain, you will come across a train tunnel exit with a very hard locked door.  Inside is full of ghouls and mines and another very hard locked door at the end.  This will take you half way into Boomer territory.  Upon exiting the second very hard locked door, immediately ahead of you, you will see a radioactive green pond and the train tracks forking either left or right, with Nellis directly ahead of you in the distance.  You want to veer right.  You can hug the cliff face for a bit as you follow the train tracks and they won't shoot at you until you round the corner.  You can get a few steps around the corner before you hear the first shell.  At that point, you can pop one turbo and make a mad dash down the tracks.  I was wearing light armor at the time and was able to get far enough with one turbo that they stopped shooting.  From there, you continue to follow the tracks until you get to the fence, then you follow the fence to the front gate of Nellis.  The only real danger of damage doing this is the ghouls and the mines in the tunnel leading up to it.  I was able to pull it off twice while taking no damage from the cannon barrage at all, so I know it's possible.  Good luck John.  I think I also tried to communicate a possible solution the the Hard Luck Blues quest, but I am not sure if it reached you.  This is my first reddit post, so sorry if I did anything wrong."
ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,NoOneImportant4,11,Mon Oct 27 15:05:28 2014 UTC,"I've always had a lot of success getting to the boomers by popping turbo, two doses of turbo is enough to get the the gate in safety with a straight sprint to the nearest part of the fence, while 3 plays it very safe(following the road right to the the gate you can make it before they even finish launching the first shot).  Of course this carries a pretty big risk for you, since popping multiple doses at the same time does increase the risk of addiction."
ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,scragar,1 point,Sun Oct 26 21:30:59 2014 UTC,If hes willing to use fixer (due to a bug it cures addictions rather then just reducing the addiction except for ultrajet) then it's no issue.

I've made it to the fence unscathed without popping any Turbo before using the ""stay by the cliff"" method, so hopefully Jon makes it without losing a limb or getting addicted. This will be one of the more tense parts of the run, to be sure."
ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,mesocyclonic4,3,Mon Oct 27 16:00:54 2014 UTC,"That fixer bug was patched about 30 years ago...  Two doses of turbo will get you through unharmed, but addiction is almost guaranteed (-2 agility forever)."

ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,acksed,6,Sun Oct 26 20:48:48 2014 UTC,Is it actually good? I always thought it was fairly weak...?
ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,acksed,7,Sun Oct 26 20:50:52 2014 UTC,"Well, the normal damage is 4, but the critical damage of the unique BB is 70. Because it's silent as well, you would be doing 74+74=148 damage through your sneak attacks. With Cowboy, that'll be 180. If you survive long enough to get the Better Criticals perk on top of that, that would bump the damage up to mumbles ((74+74)+(35+35)) =218. 218 + (218 x 0.25)=272. Although the spread is 0.5, so it might miss."
ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,Revelations216,5,Sun Oct 26 21:02:28 2014 UTC,"It's more powerful than Ratslayer if you go for sneak attack criticals, which of course you are doing a lot of. But its spread of 0.5, like acksed mentions, means you can't use it for long range sniping. From personal experience, it's still 100% accurate and devastating at medium range, and if your stealth is at, say 70, you can perform most of your close range stealth kills without being detected by someone/something else nearby.  Its durability isn't very good though, unfortunately - 495 shots at max condition, and can only be repaired with other BB guns unless one has Jury Rigging. But if you use it for one shot one kills against stronger targets, I don't think you'll come close to wearing it even halfway out.   In short, I honestly think you should consider the Abilene Kid as a closer range alternative to Ratslayer.  And please, please wear the 1st Recon Beret. That +5 critical chance saves ammo and potentially yourself from fast moving enemies like ghouls. Overconfidence could be the death of you - even if that cowboy hat looks good, it is inferior to the 1st Recon Beret.  Thanks for your time. One last question: Are you considering the Legion quest Caesar's Favor? Because I know it can routinely supply large amounts of stealthboys.  Once again, thanks, and best wishes."

ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,acksed,4,Mon Oct 27 11:06:49 2014 UTC,"On xbox it apparently only deals its critical damage if you get a head shot. If you do, then it deals 70 critical damage."

ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,antiutopie,12,Sun Oct 26 20:49:55 2014 UTC,I'm guessing MTN will go to the gate first so the Boomers stop lobbing mortars. Afterwards he can loot the BOS bodies w/o issues.  He could also pick up experience doing some of the Boomer quests while he's at it.  The first step though is to get to the gate in one piece.

ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,james_myers,2,Sun Oct 26 23:53:07 2014 UTC,"Jon a suggesting if you want to go to the bombardments unharmed.  Stick close to the rockcliff on the left. There are two places in the cliff that go more inwards. Hide in the first one BEFORE the first barrage begins. When it's over run and hide in the second inwards thingy in the cliff. After the second barrage is over you can run straight to the gate.  Also CROUCH when hiding in the corners/inward thingys.  That is how I go to the Boomers unharmed, and trust me it works I have used to with countless of playthroughs of Fallout: New Vegas."

ManyATrueNerd,2keb8k,dabisnit,1 point,Wed Oct 29 13:09:03 2014 UTC,With the risk of being too late: It is entirely possible to reach the boomers without the use of turbo/veryhard locked door etc etc while also taking no damage.   You just have to time your run in between the barrages and you'll have to be patient to wait out the howitzer shoots. Hide in the building wreckages.

It's infuriating when Cole starts randomly yelling, or you fail because you 'doubted' instead of directly accusing.  But the worst part is the driving. The game wants you to drive like you would in real life, driving cautiously and spending 20 minutes to get to your destination. But it's a videogame and nobody wants to play driving simulator, so it's just nonstop chaos and destruction until you get to the destination.  I stopped playing after the arsonist episode, so if Jon keeps playing it through I'll be interested in seeing how the game ends."

ManyATrueNerd,2k7us2,Trent_Hyster,2,Sat Oct 25 00:51:20 2014 UTC,"Yes it does? Opening doors does equalize oxygen between rooms. In the same way that a lack of oxygen can spread from one room to another, the reverse is also true obviously. The adjacent room won't run out of oxygen as long as you have the O2 running and subsequent rooms full of oxygen, so its a strategy you should always employ in those situations."

So, if you were not already aware of it, i would recommend checking /r/patientgamers for recommendations etc. on some more and less older games...  The subs idea is basically what it sounds like, instead of buying games when they come out, you wait from a few months to longer before picking up, get recommendations on older games etc."

The letterboxing, the very linear environment, the priority of set-pieces over mechanics, all suggest a desire to be cinematic. Beyond Two Souls tried this. So did Heavy Rain. But it always falls down because movies aren't 14 hours long and don't cost 35 quid. I am not filled with hope for the rest of the game."

ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,compox,17,Thu Oct 16 10:30:39 2014 UTC,"I've been considering it.   So here's what I'm thinking.  No game video of any description will ever be held back to only Patreon subscribers. Ever. I'm certain on that one.  Patreon subs would, through some mechanism, get to hear about what I'm planning next. New series, new one-offs, etc. I'd give them ideas I had, and they'd get a say in what games I did next, what challenges or rulesets I did, etc.  I might also do occasion vlogs of some description which might be just for Patreon subscribers, as channel updates, insights, something like that.  How would that sound to people?"
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,ManyATrueNerd,8,Thu Oct 16 13:26:33 2014 UTC,"I really want to get the balance right - I want Patreon to be something people freely choose to do without compulsion, but I also want to ensure people who contribute get something back, but not something that would make those who don't contribute (and many people may not be able to/feel they contribute through watching ads/may just not to, and that's legitimate) feel like I'm keeping something back from them behind a paywall.  That's the balance I need to figure out, and being worried about getting it wrong is why I haven't set up such a thing yet."
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,ManyATrueNerd,6,Thu Oct 16 14:03:31 2014 UTC,"Jon, just set it up and let people donate if they want. Problem solved and all worry gone bye bye. If people donate to you to get something back then it's not really a donation at all. It's payment for services rendered. Please don't go that way.   You don't need any more carrots in front of your donkey. Just keep on riding it into the sunset... It's doing just fine."
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,SuffolksSecretSauce,4,Thu Oct 16 18:19:21 2014 UTC,"I would like to see a patreon page of you just because if you get enough money regularly, maybe we could see more videos and make it a full-time job for you, as we were chatting on Facebook, some sneak peecks and behind the scenes could be nice and a good compromise :)  - Luca"
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,ManyATrueNerd,7,Thu Oct 16 14:35:09 2014 UTC,"Doing it full-time would be a long way off, but if it keeps growing, going part-time to support it more would be feasible, potentially..."
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,acksed,3,Thu Oct 16 14:41:45 2014 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree with your opinion.
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,SuperM737,6,Thu Oct 16 15:18:00 2014 UTC,"It seems Patreon is getting more and more popular and lots of YouTubers are hopping aboard and their communities are suggesting it to them. Now I will probably end up going on a ranty unpopular opinion here so please dont get too mad. SO for me Patreon seems like a cable subscriptions, people use Patreon as an extra source of income and I do not blame anyone especially with the bullshit that is happening with all the MCMs (counting down to when my Machinima contract runs out) and YouTube copyright BS. However a LOT of youtubers use Patreon TOO much. If content gets blocked out because you are not paying the person than that turns in to a cable subscription which is not how internet works. We all love the interent because we get hours of entertainment for free. When something like Patreon gets introduced that blocks content because you dont pay that makes me angry because that goes against everything that the internet stands for. Being a YouTuber my self I know how hard it is now with AdBlock and all the other bullshit that is going on around money on YouTube and I am hurt by it as well because I really don't have a lot of money to spend on stuff. However I believe that something like Petron should not be a thing. If someone would like to support a YouTuber there are other ways, for example donations like on Twtich or shirt store etc etc.  I am sorry if I made anyone angry with this but these are my opinions because for example I cant afford to support people on Pateron and that makes me sad. Anyways pardon all the spelling mistakes and the wall of text but I am tiered :P"
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,ManyATrueNerd,7,Thu Oct 16 19:04:24 2014 UTC,"I entirely agree, which is why I said above that absolutely under no circumstance EVER would a gaming video be withheld behind any sort of paywall.  It would only ever be set up in a such a way as it was completely optional, with it clearly advertised that you don't need to pay to get 100% of the videos :)"
ManyATrueNerd,2jen30,misterwinkey,3,Thu Oct 16 20:34:19 2014 UTC,Why don't you just setup a donation button on here for PayPal or Google wallet.  I would be happy to send some beer $$ your way.

ManyATrueNerd,2jcz5r,dabisnit,2,Thu Oct 16 03:22:54 2014 UTC,"Hmm... Ok so the Evil Within probably sucks... Also, 2 suggestions:   Maybe you can make your launch day Let's Plays actual reviews like you sort of already do, but give it a number on 1-10 and go in depth about its strengths and weaknesses. A lot of review videos are just cuts of gameplay with a voice over but when we actually watch you and see what you are complaining/praising about the game as you play it, we can see more exactly of what you're talking about. When you get your PS4, play P.T. the ""Playable Trailer"" for Silent Hill. It's a puzzle/Horror game and can be beaten in an hour or so with help.   Just a suggestion."

(Face-cam required) Start with Dead Space, go to some Evil Within (Bethesda and all, it must be good) and branch out from there.  This would also give us all some more content to get us through the week."
ManyATrueNerd,2j6wfk,LoverOfLed,4,Wed Oct 15 03:27:05 2014 UTC,Yes! Play amnesia! Half the reason I watch is to experience games I don't think I'll get a chance to play. And I'm too chicken shit to play a horror game on my own.
ManyATrueNerd,2j6wfk,Robots_From_Space,3,Tue Oct 14 06:36:26 2014 UTC,My room mates and I play outlast about once a week together and that shit is fucking scary. Like I shit my pants every time. I would love to see Jon play this.
ManyATrueNerd,2j6wfk,Fuckdeathclaws6560,2,Tue Oct 14 06:21:44 2014 UTC,They time jump scares REALLY well. They know exactly when you're not expecting them and you never get used to it.

ManyATrueNerd,2j6wfk,RaygeQuit,2,Tue Oct 14 11:29:24 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I would lovee to see Jon play one of the Resident Evil/Dead Space style games, but nothing like Amnesia or Outlast or even Five Nights at Freddy's. This is a great channel, and it is great because of how original it is. How many jump scare horror game videos have we seen over the past few years? Hundreds from Toby and Markiplier, not to mention thousands from Pewdiepie. We don't need another ""Watch me get scared and scream! LIEK N SUCSRIBE!!1!"" channel."

Go play something like Amnesia: the dark descent, or Alien: Isolation, or Silent Hill, or Resident Evils up to 4 (5&6 are more of zombie action games with maybe some very minor horror elements remaining)"

Ending up sitting through the entire run in a few evenings. Been gaming for decades, still remember loading up Dungeon Master on the old Atari. Ultima Underworld, UFO - Enemy Unknown, Civilization, World Of Xeen and Doom were all very formative experiences.   Generally I don't watch LPs but the combination of ridiculous rules, humour and friendly interaction with the viewers pulled me in!"

I found MATN while browsing through Fallout:New Vegas videos and came across his Kill Everything run. I've since caught up with all of the videos on the channel except Mass Effect and FTL. I subscribed around the time of the Hitman:Blood Money Christmas special, IIRC. I run two subreddits here and a rather inactive Tumblr juxtaposing the macabre and things more pleasing to the eye. I mostly play F:NV, Democracy 3, and Binding of Isaac when I'm not watching MATN."

I'm a tech support helpdesk worker for a major government department when I am in the real world.  I discovered MATN early into his F:NV Kill Everything run, enjoying it and the F:NV Kill Nothing run, and digesting much of his older works, like Two Brits Play Borderlands.  Gaming wise, I'm semi-core, I play a few times a week on my Xbox 360, and even less so on my PC, which is old enough in PC years to qualify for a bus pass. (That said, the government dept I work for uses PCs that ha a commercial release date of 2006, but are overhauling nationwide, to a thin-client based system.) I like my open sandbox games like Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, GTA and the like, but I also like some RPGs and simulation games.  Other hobbies in my spare time include reading (mainly low to mid fantasy) - currently I am polishing off Sergei Lukyanenko's The New Watch, the fifth of his Night Watch series. My favourite author is Mark Charan Newton, a british writer who wrote a great fantasy series called Legends of the Red Sun and is now working on a series of novels called Drakenfeld the second book of which is due out later this month. For the Drakenfeld ones, think detective novel meets fantasy world meets Roman Empire!  I keep thinking about starting my own LP series, playing some really old DOS Games that were parts of my formative years.  I also have a tumblr, but it's the most boring thing you'll read, it's just a daily blog of my eating habits, I use it as a tracking tool for myself while I work to lose weight.  So that's me."

I like open world games like Fallout and Saints Row as well as slightly more linear games like Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed. I'm a student and hope to eventually go into the film industry. Oh, and I also like drama and comedy TV."
ManyATrueNerd,2j27dm,ManyATrueNerd,2,Mon Oct 13 00:35:32 2014 UTC,"Warlax1997 here, actually found Jon's channel from an article on Kotaku over his Kill Everything in Fallout 3 playthrough that I found via /r/fallout, I believe. I'm currently a junior in high school, a player of games, and a person of rather weird humor that the wonderful people of this community share, from what I have seen. I watched about the first 3 minutes of Lyons' Pride from his Fallout 3 playthrough, said, ""Where is episode 1, this is gold"", and then proceeded to watch the entirety of that, Perfect Dark, and bits of other videos. Since then, I have recently began watching his new and amazing playthrough of L.A. Noire, and picking back up on his No Kill run of New Vegas. One of the things that keeps me coming back for more is a mixture of his interaction with the audience, and the fact that he has the great, sometimes weird sense of humor we know and love. Excited to see what he has in store for us in the future, and glad that I had clicked on that article that led me here."
ManyATrueNerd,2j27dm,warlax1997,2,Mon Oct 13 01:39:43 2014 UTC,"Ohh Perfect Dark, my first ever series. I rewatched that recently - the editing is darn scruffy."
ManyATrueNerd,2j27dm,Dblitzer,2,Mon Oct 13 10:16:47 2014 UTC,"Maybe, but it was a good series, thats for sure. I think it was a mix of that and Evil Jon's rampant murder and bloodlust that cemented my love for the channel in general."

Loved the series Jon, and remember, we're always watching. Always  I'm Comrade Oberst Tsar Blitzer-Sama, 24 years old. Patrolling the Ohio wasteland almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter. Almost certain that I discovered this channel via the Fallout subreddit during November-December 2013?   ManyATrueNerd was a nice change of pace from what I've typically watched when it comes to the gaming scene. So I was hooked almost immediately. The only FO3/NV playthrough I had watched previously was JoshJepson's FO3 run, which was not terribly impressive. The No-Kill run was funny, well informed, and in general taught me a lot about New Vegas."

I've been watching YouTube gamers for a long ol' time starting off with the Yogscast (back in like 2009) and slowly just acquiring new subscriptions to people like TotalBiscuit and TrumpSC and most recently MATN.  I found this channel because i came across a reddit post that mentioned his Fallout Kill Everything series and thought that sounded entertaining...   Since then I've watched most of his backlog (I especially enjoyed the lore-intensive mass effect playthrough) and am interested to see how long Jon survives his latest Fallout run 'You Only Live Once' (also i refuse to make that an acronym!)."

Ended up binging on everything FO related, moved on the Why Not Wednesday, and now wait anxiously for Sunday's FO:NV YOLO run.    Excellent entertainment and immensely informative, Jon's approach to games I've sunk thousands of hours into gives me the opportunity to watch variations I've never seen before.

I go by gnowor just about everywhere though and my friends call me gnow (pronounced like know).  By day (and by night, depending on the day), I'm an attorney in Los Angeles.  Found MATN through the kotaku article I believe around beginning of September.  Since then, I've watched around 3/4ths of the videos ever uploaded to MATN.  Definitely put in more time watching MATN than Netflix in the last month.  That's saying something.  Since Jon likes to hear about people discovering Fallout through MATN, here's my story, which will seem pretty clueless to many I'm sure.  Been gaming since around '93.  For some reason, as Fallout games came out, I thought they were shooters.  I can't even remember why now, but the reasoning definitely pre-dates a time when you could just youtube video reviews.  Instead, through MATN, I found out exactly what they are.  Fallout 3 and NV? First/third person RPGs like Skyrim (obviously, because Bethesda) which I have at least a hundred hours into before getting anywhere on the main quest.  Fallout 1 & 2? Isometric RPGs, just like the old school ones like the Summoning (props to anyone that knows it, or was alive when it was out).  Thanks Jon.  You do great work, great editing, and you and Claire both have great personalities well suited to Youtube. Keep it up. (I'll run out of videos soon.)"

I found Jon some time shortly after stumbling upon /r/Fallout and seeing the statistics of his Kill Everything runs of Fallouts 3 and NV.

Also, i'm the founder and one half of the mod team on the stupid one trick pony of a sub /r/headcannnon (and yes, three n's is correct, it's a combination of headcanon and headcannon, and born out of an XKCD).

Haha, I didn't know this was a thing. I used to do it in Deus Ex to get past lasers and stuff, I thought it was just a quirk of the unreal engine. Strange that it works in Fallout too."
ManyATrueNerd,2iqqj4,MuDelta,-1,Thu Oct 9 12:59:36 2014 UTC,"There are so many more amazing mods, like Project Vegas that aims to make the game harder but also more fun. Texture upgrades, if you want them, more radio stations, different guns (op and balanced), and almost anything you could want and probably more.  Also, recording on a PC is much less of a hassle. And if you want to, you can still use a controller (no idea why, KB moves just fine and the accuracy even a basic mouse gives over a joystick is just amazing).  You really ought to consider a PC, it's in every way superior to the consoles if you're willing to spend even 400-500£ for a mid-range gaming PC. And the more you're willing to spend, especially on the initial jump, the greater the disparity to even ""next gen"" (ps4/xbone) consoles. And you can easily upgrade it. Say you get a decent 400£ PC, which should let you run most games on 60fps/medium graphics at least... And then comes a few months later, a game that only runs 30/medium comes along. You can spend, oh about 150£ to 200£ to upgrade say your GPU or CPU if they're the bottleneck. Or get more RAM if that's the problem.  So, PC is in every way greater gaming machine than consoles will ever be. Main reason consoles are kicking around are exclusives, and most of those even seem to be timed (even if it's a few years, like GTA V now coming to PC [and to ""next"" gen consoles], and stuff like that), so that's not that big of a problem.  Also, games are way cheaper especially if you're willing to use steam and possibly others (avoid uPlay as much as possible, it's just piss poor...) like GoG which is actually DRM free, but mostly has old(er) titles. I think it was being manned by CDProjekt Red (makers of the Witcher games).  In essence, ditch the life of a poor console peasant and join the glorious 60FPS PC master race."

If guns or energy, I usually carry a gun of each ammo type, until higher levels when I drop the lower caliber stuff. If melee or unarmed, I only carry stuff with different effects. Everything else gets sold or stored.  In TES, it's even more simple. Pick your specialty, use the best weapon you have available, sell the rest. If it's a unique weapon, store it in your house. Chances are it's cool to have, but not as good as what you can craft on your own.   So basically, the answer is get a house."

Two things:   You missed a stealth boy right by the first Nightkin body inside the front door of the Repcon Facility. It's not in the Nightkin's actual inventory, but rather physically next to his body. I saw it next to him when you tried to search him. In regards to your questions on the antidote etc...this is related. What will you do if your head gets crippled? I was under the impression that you wouldn't heal crippled limbs or anything, but if you get your head crippled, you will probably have to play the rest of the game with that annoying headache/concussion animation that blurs everything and plays a high pitched sound every few seconds..."

After rewatching some old Nerdcubed stuff, I decided to buy the Red Faction pack (1, 2, Guerrilla, and Armageddon) on steam, and am currently awaiting on the day I can play them. In the meantime, your videos will be a more-than amazing substitute. Thanks for the content, and best of luck!"

In a revolver, the cartridges (yellow circlely bits) stay in the gun after it fires, in an automatic, they get thrown out of the side."

ManyATrueNerd,2ianz5,AddictiveSombrero,5,Sat Oct 4 19:18:42 2014 UTC,Is the audio slightly out of sync? You seemed to be responding to things a bit late when you're running over the police officer guy.
ManyATrueNerd,2ianz5,AddictiveSombrero,2,Sun Oct 5 01:03:13 2014 UTC,"It's not impossible - I record all my commentary live, but on a separate audio track, so I can adjust the audio levels independent. I then have to resync them, which I do via doing something I can easily tie to something I'm saying (like saying 'down down down' while moving down through a menu).  However, if the game footage, as it renders, has any issues that cause it to go ever to slightly slower or faster than actual (it can happen), my audio can slip ever so slightly out of sync.  I tend to notice it and correct it manually, so hopefully it was more than a tenth of a second :)"
ManyATrueNerd,2ianz5,INFisher,2,Sun Oct 5 09:25:42 2014 UTC,"Oh, right. I just realised that I didn't mention the actual episode in my first comment, so i'd like to say that this was a great video and I hope you do more with LA Noire :D"
ManyATrueNerd,2ianz5,INFisher,2,Sun Oct 5 11:23:51 2014 UTC,"No worries - sadly, I'm at the mercy of various bits of technology to achieve perfect fidelity of recording.  If any stage of encoding, or rendering, or recording, or exporting, messes up, I can end up ever so slightly out of sync, but generally it's not noticeable.  Last night, I spent half an hour dragging the game audio and the game footage back into space for the new Red Faction videos, because somehow the game audio itself decided it didn't fancy syncing, even though it was recorded at the same time by the same device and then rendered at the same time by the same program...  Sadly, these things happen, and I correct them as best I can."
ManyATrueNerd,2ianz5,INFisher,2,Sun Oct 5 11:32:59 2014 UTC,"Wait a minute, new Red Faction? Damn it Jon, are you attempting to steal all my free time? I even bought Red Faction after the first video you made."

ManyATrueNerd,2ianz5,newdle2,1 point,Sat Oct 4 21:52:13 2014 UTC,"Hollywood Sign:       The Hollywood Sign (formerly the Hollywoodland Sign) is a landmark and American cultural icon located in Los Angeles, California. It is situated on Mount Lee in the Hollywood Hills area of the Santa Monica Mountains. The sign overlooks the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.  ""HOLLYWOOD"" is spelled out in 45-foot-tall (14 m)  white capital letters, and is 350 feet (110 m) long. It was originally created in 1923 as an advertisement for a local real estate development, but it garnered increasing recognition after the sign was left up.  The sign was a frequent target of pranks and vandalism, but it has since undergone restoration, including the installation of a security system to deter vandalism. The sign is protected and promoted by the Hollywood Sign Trust, a nonprofit organization.  From the ground, the contours of the hills give the sign its ""wavy"" appearance, as reflected in the Hollywood Video logo, for example. When observed at a comparable altitude, as in the photo shown on the right, the letters appear nearly level.    Image i     Interesting: The Hollywood Sign (film) | Mary C.

ManyATrueNerd,2i2070,ManyATrueNerd,2,Thu Oct 2 09:52:53 2014 UTC,"It's really simple and was fun to make.  I pipe the raw rgb video frame by frame from ffmpeg to a python script.  HUD detection is done by looking for yellow pixels in a certain small part of the frame; if found then the text and HD bars overlay is added to that frame.  All the frames are piped back out to ffmpeg for simultaneous reencoding.  It takes as input a list of hp, max hp, and times when it changes; everything else is automatic.  This means this framework could be used for other automatic video augmentations for other applications, like a kill counter in Kill Everything. :)"

There's no reason to do the panic run-in-and-disarm with landmines, if you crouch and creep forward your disarm reach is longer than the detonate reach.  I think your reach is also based on your explosive skill.  I tried the same thing with the dynamite around the powder ganger areas near the prison early on in a playthrough and got myself blowed up, but later on in the game I was able to creep and disarm without a problem.

I am just asking these questions purely out of curiosity as I edit videos a lot as well and spend countless hours in front of the editor so I was just wondering what his process is because for me it did not seem as that big of a deal to add the counter to the whole video so I wanted to find out what on his end makes it become such a wok load of effort. So again I am sorry if it seemed offensive or something it was not meant that way :P Professional curiosity thats all.
ManyATrueNerd,2hpvae,SuperM737,1 point,Mon Sep 29 11:11:05 2014 UTC,"My bad, thats not the way its meant to come out. I wasn't trying to advertise my self or anything if thats what people think.

ManyATrueNerd,2hpvae,Jethro_McCrazy,3,Mon Sep 29 19:41:55 2014 UTC,"Nope, the timings often don't work. I tend to record two parts over a few hours, but then that footage needs to be rendered by my capture program, then needs to be crunched down to be edited, then edited, then rendered back up to 720p, so the whole process takes so long I tend to dedicate a whole day to either recording, or editing, and only rush through both on launch days."

It sucks a lot and is glitchy and buggy but I dont need to render it out I just record and than plop it in to Sony Vegas and render it after editing.

I like the use of the travalig merchant to aid you, make me want to load up a save and follow the merchants to see what dangers they encounter.  Also next week it seems my bet on you coming into play so erm... good luck :D"
ManyATrueNerd,2hpvae,alexxerth,2,Sun Sep 28 22:10:00 2014 UTC,"Two points about the Ratslayer.  a) the 5x multiplier only increases the chance you land a critical on a non-sneak-attack, which is simply another 23 points; it does not multiply the damage. Landing a Sneak Attack Critical, however, adds the critical damage then doubles the damage. (23 + 23) x 2 = 92 damage. Very respectable.  b) there is a bug associated with it that I can't quite believe. If you kill someone with the Ratslayer, it instantly alerts the enemies around them. Even though it's silenced. Now it might not be that bad; if they still can't see Jon, they'll eventually calm down. It may mean more waiting though."
ManyATrueNerd,2hpvae,Jethro_McCrazy,3,Mon Sep 29 08:15:58 2014 UTC,But it is classified as a PC Bug on the wiki

Lister: You what? Holly: It seems when you left Earth, 3 million years ago, you left two half-eaten German sausages on a plate in your kitchen. Do you know what happens to sausages left unattended for 3 million years? Lister: Yeah, they go mouldy. Holly: Your sausages, Dave, now cover seven-eights of the Earth's surface. Also, you left £17.50 in your bank account. Thanks to compound interest, you now own 98% of all the world's wealth. And because you've hoarded it for 3 million years, nobody's got any money except for you and Norweb. Lister: Why Norweb? Holly: You left a light on in the bathroom.

ManyATrueNerd,2h52tg,kolboldbard,6,Mon Sep 22 19:37:28 2014 UTC,"Indeed, but their website bullishly claims they still own it, and Steam claims they're the current publisher, despite the fact the company doesn't seem to have existed since 2011...  And that's a problem because that means there's nobody to ask for permission to put up videos, leaving me exposed to risk of copyright claims I couldn't fight - and that's a serious risk for a YouTuber..."
ManyATrueNerd,2h52tg,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Sep 22 19:48:14 2014 UTC,"Nobody really owns the rights anymore, im fairly certain it's considered abandonware at this point.  If permission is a complete necessity than I would probably avoid it as, last I heard, the stalker rights were still in the hands of the games original creator Sergey Grigorovich 1. I doubt you'd ever get a word from him considering he hasn't commented on STALKER since 2012.  If it's any use I personally have never seen a STALKER video taken down or have had my own stalker videos taken down. In fact there is a pretty well known youtuber (400k subs) who did a play through here and (as far as I know) never had a problem.  EDIT: /u/Servant_of_Azathoth opened my eyes to some pretty illuminating information. I'd def listen to what he's saying and contact GSC. Bitcomposer actually do not have the license to produce any more STALKER games. They just have the rights to adapt roadside picnic, despite what bitComposer has been releasing in their press announcements. 2 3  Although their website does list Call of Pripyat as one of their products no other STALKER products are shown. I'd try to contact GSC here or bitComposer here  btw if you are gonna play STALKER I highly suggest Call of Pripyat over Shadow of Chernobyl even if SoC is generally considered the ""noob friendliest"""
ManyATrueNerd,2h52tg,Servant_of_Azathoth,1 point,Mon Sep 22 20:49:19 2014 UTC,"It looks like GSC Gameworlds still exists in some form, and have updated the game as recently as June 2014 to remove the gamespy requirements. Honestly if you're worried about it you could contact both GSC and bitComposer as they both claim to own it.   Frankly I think you're perfectly safe provided you don't claim in the video that it's definitively owned by one or the other, as until it's 100% clear who actually does own it, they're not going to worry about LP videos on YouTube."
ManyATrueNerd,2h52tg,ManyATrueNerd,4,Mon Sep 22 20:33:34 2014 UTC,"Oh, I know I'm 99% safe, but if somebody did decide to issue a copyright strike or takedown notice, that's a whole world of hurt for the channel - no ability to upload videos set to unlisted, and no videos longer than 15 minutes allowed, both of which are pretty crippling for me.  Just in case, I tend to play it safe until I get some confirmation one way or another. It's why I don't do Nintendo right now - until they clarify their position on YouTube more clearly, it's not worth the risk."

This could get problematic since you can't pick and choose which addictions to cure.  You'd essentially have to live with all the other addictions you might get if you became addicted to buffout.  I'd say that would be more than a fair price you'd have to pay for using it.﻿"
ManyATrueNerd,2h1ygi,acksed,12,Sun Sep 21 23:27:48 2014 UTC,"The page on the wiki that you were looking for was Healing Rate   Healing rate in New Vegas is set according to a character's Endurance stat. An Endurance of 9 or 10 gives a healing rate of 10, Endurance 6-8 gives a healing rate of 5, and Endurance 5 or less gives no healing rate at all. Each point of healing rate restores 0.066HP per in-game hour, which translates to 1HP every three hours for a rate of 5, and 2HP every three hours for a rate of 10. The effect is applied in real-time, during waiting, and while sleeping in Hardcore.   So you can get rid of the Healing by reducing your Endurance to 5 or less."
ManyATrueNerd,2h1ygi,Bookworm12k,3,Mon Sep 22 05:50:14 2014 UTC,"Interesting that it was in Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics, so it's not a new thing."

ManyATrueNerd,2h1ygi,BalefirePhoenix,15,Sun Sep 21 20:56:30 2014 UTC,"With regard to the Buffout situation- as long as you don't use it when you have less than 60HP then I think it's fine to use.  Also, do you know if the autoheal feature restores limbs in addition to health? If you got a crippled leg, for example, and it healed, you would have a faster movement speed than if it had stayed crippled. I know how seriously you are taking this run and this should be considered if you accidentally step on a mine or do something similar."

ManyATrueNerd,2h290e,Daepilin,2,Sun Sep 21 21:11:39 2014 UTC,"On hardcore I would say Hard would be the best. Normal is too easy, even for newbies. I would not go higher, as it scales quite quickly and on each level up the monsters level as well and if you are unlucky and don't get new gear every few levels for most slots (especially a weapon) it can get quite difficult or at least very slow.  On Softcore I would go for Expert (the one above hard). Without the permadeath hard can be a bit boring.   My personal recommendation(~400h D3 in Vanilla + 300h with the Addon, played all classes on sc and hc through vanilla and most to 70 in the Addon) though is to start on softcore at least for one playthrough and only then create a hardcore char. But I'm no risky player, if you like the risk hc first is fine, I just like to know what waits for me before I loose 30 hours to one dumb move because I did not know the encounter."
ManyATrueNerd,2h290e,JMAN7102,1 point,Sun Sep 21 21:53:27 2014 UTC,"If you've never played it before, then I'd suggest normal mode with probably Expert as the difficulty. It is challenging in the boss fights, but it is also fair.  I can say this as I picked up Reaper of Souls as my first Diablo game ever and played through it on Expert and Master my first time through and had a blast! However, Daepilin seems to have much more time invested in the game,"

ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,ManyATrueNerd,7,Sat Sep 20 21:03:32 2014 UTC,Oh and here's the complete playlist :)
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,Vladnim,1 point,Sat Sep 20 21:06:04 2014 UTC,I've been watching since the first episode. This series was awesome. I thought I was a super fan for Mass Effect but you showed me so many Easter eggs that I never knew were there. I immensely enjoyed seeing you put your own spin on this awesome game. I loved this farewell and it has been an honor to watch you play.
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,clp605,5,Sun Sep 21 23:43:06 2014 UTC,"I will admit, I normally choose Udina. As much as I like Anderson, it never felt like it made sense for Anderson to take the position to me. I can't think of any time where he played the political game in comparison to Udina who has been playing it from before the game even started and, to his credit, has proven he can can get stuff done. He pushed for humanity to get their spot on the Council, which they get at the end of the game, and for the Specter position Shepard ended up getting at the start of the game.  Anderson or Udina is actually one of my favorite decisions (right next to saving or sacrificing the Council) in Mass Effect 1 as if really does feel like it has a major impact for the entire human race. In any case, it's been a fun journey, Jon. Reinvigorated my interest in Mass Effect and made me replay the series again. 11/10, would watch it continue."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,clp605,3,Sat Sep 20 22:20:44 2014 UTC,"I just never got over the view that Udina would dismiss anyone/anything as soon as it wasn't in line with his ambitions, which felt as much selfish as anything else (I got the feeling he wanted the prestige as much as just wanting the best for humanity).  Somebody that lacking in integrity and loyalty worried me, and I think ME3 vindicated that concern."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,XmRyan,2,Sat Sep 20 22:32:12 2014 UTC,"For those who haven't played it, Major Spoiler for Mass Effect 3  I wouldn't say he was lacking loyalty, if anything he was extremely loyal to humanity. Just misplaced loyalty. He tried to make it work with the Council and when that failed he turned to Cerberus to try and save Earth. I guess by threatening them to help Earth, I don't think that it's ever specifically stated. And I don't know if that's a flaw in the writing by not making it clear or a flaw in my memory."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,forgodandthequeen,4,Sat Sep 20 23:05:36 2014 UTC,"Maybe I just missed some of his reasoning, but I always felt that Saren's reasoning was much more sympathetic"

ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,BalefirePhoenix,3,Sun Sep 21 02:39:46 2014 UTC,Udina is somewhat sympathetic at the beginning of ME3. He sounds genuinely sad when he speaks about Arcturus Station.

ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,ThisIsAWittyName,2,Sat Sep 20 21:49:35 2014 UTC,"Sovereign being weakened by husk-Saren's death because he lost a part of his (code?) to it   That always seemed pretty weird. Sovereign the clearly superior Reaper in terms of firepower, indoctrination or villain speechescuttlefishes! can't survive the death of a single husk, but Harbinger does his DIRECT CONTROL every ten seconds and he ends up A-OK."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,SuperM737,4,Sat Sep 20 22:29:05 2014 UTC,"Maybe Harbinger learnt from Sovereign? Sovereign was the first Reaper to encounter Shepard, and he wasn't impressed. He just assumes that if he personally manifests and takes on Shepard, he'll win.  After he loses, Harbinger wises up - Shepard is dangerous, so much that he warns the other Reapers, which the dying Reaper on Rannoch confirms - they're actually worried about Shepard. So naturally he goes after Shepard, but he does it safely, first by just blasting his ship apart, and then by attacking him, but not in a way that losing costs him his life."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,stevethebandit,1 point,Sat Sep 20 22:36:13 2014 UTC,"Actually, case closed - ME3 apparently did confirm that all Reapers abandoned consciousness transfers after ME1:   The feedback from Saren's death seemed to entirely overload Sovereign's shields. Current Reapers do not seem to suffer from this design flaw.   Sovereign's death seems to be a good motivation to safen up like that (alternatively, if the Codex is taken literally, it was a ""design flaw"" that somehow went unnoticed for the entire harvest)."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,TheNormalSun,1 point,Sat Sep 20 23:10:48 2014 UTC,"I suppose generally it never previously came up - if every previous harvest started with the whole Citadel-relay-works-Reapers-eat-the-Government plan going correctly, then the entire Galaxy was disorganised and nobody ever managed to resist as effective as Shepard did (Vigil certainly seems to imply that's how previous cycles were lost).  Maybe Sovereign was the first time a consciousness transfer to personally attack one person was ever needed."
ManyATrueNerd,2gzbnl,ThisIsAWittyName,1 point,Sat Sep 20 23:18:48 2014 UTC,Well harbinger directly controls biological beings but Sovereign was putting some of himself in a new machine.

ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,cpmx,19,Thu Sep 18 20:15:38 2014 UTC,"Interestingly, Skyrim was my first Elder Scrolls game - I never played the others before.  I do, however, own the ultimate edition (or whatever it's called) of Oblivion, and indeed to do that at some point..."
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,ManyATrueNerd,9,Thu Sep 18 20:53:19 2014 UTC,The ultimate edition?! Let Jon become the new mad king in placement of Sheogorath!
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,The9KK9,7,Thu Sep 18 21:13:59 2014 UTC,A lot of the mechanics in Morrowind were simplified in Oblivion and then completely changed for Skyrim so if you haven't played any of the others you will probably be surprised by just how completely different they are in terms of gameplay especially when it comes to things like spells.
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,ManyATrueNerd,8,Thu Sep 18 21:13:08 2014 UTC,"Sounds good to me - it's hard to play older games when they're much less complex than the original, because awesome new stuff hadn't been added at that point.  It'll be interesting to play something very different, I think."
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,Blizdi,6,Thu Sep 18 23:21:08 2014 UTC,I agree completely and thats one of the reasons Morrowind is still fun to go back and play every once and awhile it has cool spells and things they removed from the later games like levitation and throwing stars though the latter is pretty useless overall
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,ChetBenning,2,Fri Sep 19 04:51:14 2014 UTC,"Jeez, compared to Morrowind, Skyrim's mechanics are, as the cool kids are saying... whizzity whizzity whack.  Skyrim feels like Babies First RPG compared to Morrowind/Daggerfall."
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,ksheep,9,Tue Sep 23 01:53:16 2014 UTC,"Note about Morrowind: it ran like ass on the Xbox with long loading times, and didn't do very well on the 360, so I'd suggest playing on PC. The good news is that vanilla MW will run on a toaster."
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,Ilitarist,3,Fri Sep 19 00:08:31 2014 UTC,"That and there are a bunch of mods to improve the game, including several unofficial patches, as well as sound and texture enhancement mods."
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,owenkass,3,Fri Sep 19 05:06:06 2014 UTC,"""Kill everything"" is not the only Many can do.   Modern Skyrim/Fallout player coming to Morrowind is interesting in itself. And I'm sure Many can invent some sort of interesting roleplay for a player who doesn't know the game - like being obsessed with social status and fancy clothes and obscure weapons. Fallout 3/NV Kill Everything worked well cause MATN knows those games and showed many interesting things, could be real cruel before killing people.   We don't want him to come to Morrowing and kill people in Balmora cornerclub before visiting the fort nearby, if you know what I mean."
ManyATrueNerd,2gslii,Ilitarist,1 point,Fri Sep 19 10:36:41 2014 UTC,I imagine it like the fallout kill everything runs where he didn't immediately kill everything but completed quests first then went on a killing spree but your right there are tons of different things he could do with morrowind

Some of my favorite stuff Jon does is when he really has to plan out his actions. (Not that he doesn't plan his kill everything videos, but you can really feel the tension when he slows down.)  No Kill, Yolo, and things like Hitman are all about precision. Kill everything is a steamroller.   Sometimes the carnage is entertaining, but since we only get one Fallout a week, I prefer the more methodical Jon ."
ManyATrueNerd,2gp836,ManyATrueNerd,9,Thu Sep 18 14:51:38 2014 UTC,"There's more of that to come - I just did some YOLO editing last night - there's a lot of very carefully thought out progression, I like the change of pace"

ManyATrueNerd,2go8ca,salasy,16,Wed Sep 17 16:33:50 2014 UTC,I think it would actually be fairly doable if you took a low-content approach. I'm hoping to do a lot of quests as well :)

In a YOLO playthrough, the first thing I would personally prioritise is getting my hands on some Riot Gear from the Commissary Terminal at the beginning of the DLC, and acquiring an upgraded ED-E.  The only enemies you'd have to face would be a small family of very soft coyotes, in exchange for some of the best non-faction armour in the game, and the handiest companion you can get.

ManyATrueNerd,2gbb27,Lolita_Humbert,2,Sun Sep 14 01:28:36 2014 UTC,"I think meeting Vigil for the firft time is one of my favourite experiences in my gaming history. Though it's a bit dragged out, it was meeting the (what was thought to be) the last ""living"" remnant of a great civilization. It's like meeting a ghost of a Roman. And I still get chills from it, years afterwards. It's just so magnificent and actually epic. And so many mysteries get answered, but also so many more are just teased about, never actually fully revealed."
ManyATrueNerd,2gbb27,NuclearChickadee,3,Sun Sep 14 11:15:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, until ME3 kicked itself in the head and gave us Javik"
ManyATrueNerd,2gbb27,Lolita_Humbert,3,Sun Sep 14 13:41:28 2014 UTC,"I try to forget all the world and plot destruction/nuking from orbit ME3 did. I seriously do not consider Javik to be canon, based on the fact that it's so tacked on and on top of it all, a DLC character. ME3 did so, so much damage to the mysteries of the ME world, I'll never personally accept any of it as canon."
ManyATrueNerd,2gbb27,voodoothatyoudo,3,Sun Sep 14 14:08:12 2014 UTC,But Javik was awesome. One of my favorite characters from the game.

ManyATrueNerd,2g8eux,Dblitzer,1 point,Sat Sep 13 01:54:57 2014 UTC,"-Scrolls over engines  ""Evade is meaningless, evade is literally meaningless right now""  Evade might not of had much value, but i'm pretty sure to get the max FTL charge from your engines, you need to actually have power in them. So leaving a hanging power there from 15:05 to 16:27 when you were going to run anyway was a mistake. Though at that point, the run was probably already lost and the impact of one to two power probably wouldn't of had that large of an effect, it's worthwhile to remember in future challenge runs.  Considering the talk of Captains edition, is the next run going to be that mod or vanilla?"

ManyATrueNerd,2g5avn,PsycoSaurus,6,Thu Sep 11 22:27:46 2014 UTC,"It would be rather mundane to watch. Interesting to play, just not to watch."
ManyATrueNerd,2g5avn,SykoKiller666,3,Thu Sep 11 23:23:43 2014 UTC,I agree. I'd rather him just focus on the main challenge instead of adding something that could be a challenge on it's own.
ManyATrueNerd,2g5avn,Minimii_15,3,Fri Sep 12 04:47:39 2014 UTC,That's sounds super interesting. I think a guide would be mandatory for anyone to play this just to avoid some of the garbage just in people's homes.

ManyATrueNerd,2g4ry5,ManyATrueNerd,3,Thu Sep 11 23:05:02 2014 UTC,Fair enough.
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,Jethro_McCrazy,22,Thu Sep 11 06:35:15 2014 UTC,That's actually quite a nice ruleset for Skyrim
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Thu Sep 11 11:53:46 2014 UTC,Thanks Jon! I'm having a lot of fun with it!
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,JustinDP,4,Thu Sep 11 23:52:10 2014 UTC,"The idea isn't necessarily bad, but I think the main issue would simply be how long it might take him to find a unique weapon (assuming we're specifically limiting this to named weapons and not merely enchanted weapons).  I would think allowing Argonian or Khajiit claws would be kind of too easy, and would likely be better to avoid.  I think if he was going to do something like this, he may as well go the whole hog and simply do a ""minimal kill"" run where he only kills anything if the game absolutely 100% forces him too. Sadly, I think the reason he's avoided this game in spite of the requests is that it's not quite as flexible as Fallout is in the concept of playing in ways other than intended."
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,SuperM737,2,Thu Sep 11 08:04:25 2014 UTC,"I did some brief research before starting my run. I only actually had to use my Khajiit claws for about 20 minutes. Just about as long as it took to get to Riverwood. Bolar's Oathblade is actually quite near Riverwood. It's a unique Blades sword, so it's pretty decent, especially compared to other beginning weapons. But you can't improve magical weapons until Smithing reaches level 60, so it's still a challenge. Plus, because unarmed doesn't count towards any of the combat trees, your combat skills are underleveled by the time you get to it. But, that's why it's a challenge run.  The thing I like about the run is that it really encourages doing a ton of side quests. I'm planning on starting the Dark Brotherhood quest soon, just so I can get a decent bow. Right now all I have is the Bow of the Hunt."
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,Asev,2,Thu Sep 11 23:51:27 2014 UTC,Inspired by Jon I was thinking of doing a Kill Everything in Skyrim but as you said that is something that would take for ever as NPC don't show up on the radar as well as the respawn rate is much higher so enemies spawn constantly.
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,SuperM737,3,Thu Sep 11 08:15:49 2014 UTC,Plus there are way too many people who can't die.

ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,Asev,1 point,Thu Sep 11 09:15:12 2014 UTC,"It might break the game or be a little difficult for Jon to get working, but there are mods that remove that and make everyone killable (except children, of course).  Although, as mentioned above, finding everyone in Skyrim to kill is a nightmare and gets dull after a while."
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,Nebula2680,2,Thu Sep 11 10:46:35 2014 UTC,"Jon plays on 360, so he can't use mods."
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,Cheesle,1 point,Thu Sep 11 11:24:23 2014 UTC,"For the most part, yes. The majority of his videos are of X360 games, and those are, unfortunately, not moddable.  He obviously has a PC though - his recent videos on Hatoful Boyfriend and FTL prove this, as does his creation of a Steam account.   Whether it can run Skyrim (especially modded Skyrim) is a different matter altogether though; I vaguely recall him mentioning somewhere that the reason he doesn't upload many PC game vids is because his computer isn't so great."
ManyATrueNerd,2g2z4o,Nebula2680,3,Thu Sep 11 12:18:58 2014 UTC,"He's said before it's a ""workhorse"" computer for editing, rendering etc. It could probably run Skyrim, but it wouldn't be able to record the gameplay at the same time without serious frame rate drop."

But it was pretty cool punching all your dragons to death. I did play on the easiest difficulty though, because Skyrim is more about doing whatever I want than the challenge. But it shouldn't be too hard I guess on normal?"

ManyATrueNerd,2fuzla,ManyATrueNerd,3,Tue Sep 9 00:29:25 2014 UTC,Just read it! Great to see that you've wooed over a media outlet with your entertaining videos and personality! They have to interview Claire though eventually lol
ManyATrueNerd,2fuzla,FalloutLoneWanderer,3,Tue Sep 9 01:32:51 2014 UTC,Congratulations! Just saw it and was about to post it here :) You are getting a lot of media coverage now! That is so cool! This is the best thing for the channel as it will grow at an extremely rapid pace now. Did you sign some deal with Kotaku for multiple coverages? ;) I wish I was covered on Kotaku at some point xD
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,ManyATrueNerd,15,Mon Sep 8 19:59:55 2014 UTC,"I was finding it amusing just how invested you're getting with this and then I realized I was getting just as invested myself. I definitely want more, honestly I'd like a full series on this."
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,JKOTV,12,Mon Sep 8 21:22:19 2014 UTC,"So, This image.  John remarked on it during the game. Those are clearly post apocalyptic ruins. Almost like the Boneyard from Fallout. There clearly was some sort of apocalypse in the past, that resulted in super intelligent birds."
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,kolboldbard,8,Tue Sep 9 01:07:21 2014 UTC,And here is what will help me get through Monday's from here on in
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,alexxerth,8,Mon Sep 8 21:21:35 2014 UTC,"YES! More odd pigeon dating, please!"
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,Lolita_Humbert,8,Mon Sep 8 20:44:46 2014 UTC,"Indeed, more please!"
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,TOHSNBN,6,Mon Sep 8 20:58:53 2014 UTC,Yes more! This is hilarious
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,FocusOnThePie,7,Mon Sep 8 23:14:40 2014 UTC,"Just so you know Jon, the book you recommended was a play on Oreimo, or My Little Sister Can't Possibly be this Cute. Basically THE Japanese lightly incestuous romance series. Library bird was definitely weirded out.  Though it's actually not that bad and has many surprisingly good and redeeming parts much like this ridiculous bird dating game."
ManyATrueNerd,2fu6ea,Ponicrat,5,Tue Sep 9 05:13:18 2014 UTC,This is too good. I love it!

If Jon makes it to Dead Money, he just has to make sure he keeps his distance from them. And he probably should watch some detailed playthroughs of Dead Money at least.   That's probably not enough. He needs at least one practice playthrough."

I had faith - you guys in the Western timezones pulled it off Sunday night :)  I'm celebrating by returning to work after last week, when I was off, which was immensely lucky, as it was JUST when it was most useful for me to be around.  I'll be honest, it's been an underwhelming reward.  As for the channel, I'll be keeping up momentum by increasing the number of videos for now, so, this week, you get 5 videos :)"

ManyATrueNerd,2frz2o,TOHSNBN,2,Mon Sep 8 11:16:58 2014 UTC,"The right way, i think, would be a logarithmic progression scale. You have to exploit this psycologic weakness of us humans for quick gratification :)"

ManyATrueNerd,2fsf66,ManyATrueNerd,8,Mon Sep 8 13:12:14 2014 UTC,"The loot from Honest Hearts is worth the risk, and it's best to do it at a lower level. If you go in at to high a level the enemies start using insane high damage weapons like AMRs and 12.7mm sub-machine guns. The loot you get is basically three of the best weapons in the game."

ManyATrueNerd,2fsf66,Elek1138,5,Mon Sep 8 14:09:51 2014 UTC,One day. I have half a plan for that.
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,NSFW-PORN-ONLY,6,Mon Sep 8 06:51:23 2014 UTC,"To quote what he has said before on this issue:  ""So a few people have asked why I play on consoles, when PC gaming would allow me to experience the World of Mods.  So I wanted to quickly explain my thinking on that.  So first on PC Gaming. Firstly, I appreciate that for a similar price to a current gen console, I could get a PC that graphically blows the consoles away.  However, I don't like the uncertainty that this brings to the party. Sure, a game released today might be spectacular, but what PC is a game coming out next year being optimised for? PCs improve in an ongoing and incremental fashion, meaning my computer would constantly and unavoidably become more obselete every single day. With a console, at least, that's the standard for an entire generation - and I know that what I have in front of me is what the developers and playtesters have too.  And even when the PC is brand new, there's no guarantee that all that graphical power will do me any good. Firstly, and this may be somewhat controversial, I struggle to see any effective difference between ultra-graphic settings modded PC footage, and 360 footage of the same game. I know that there is a difference, and if you put two screenshots side-by-side, of course I can see it, but when I'm playing a game, I'm never going to notice this - immersion cannot be improved by incremental improvements to rock textures.  In addition, even the best PCs seem to bug out sometimes - when CoD Ghosts came out (I'm not a fan, incidentally, but I was curious enough to watch some gameplay of it), I saw several Youtubers with amazing computers suffer from flickering and other graphic errors, just because their amazing PC set-up was slightly different to the other amazing PC set-up that the game was optimised for.  All in all, I'm just happier in the slightly scruffier world of consoles, where at least I know I'm set for 5 years.  But then there's the question of Mods - but here are the four reasons I personally don't actually like mods.  Community  I like the fact that people can play along with what I'm doing, so I tend to stick to the vanilla game. If I went on PC and modded everything, people with consoles wouldn't be able to play along.  Lore  Given I love getting immersed in a game world, this one is the real deal-breaker for me - that 99% of mods seem to have no interest in the game universe's lore. I'm looking at you, the 67 billion Skyrim mods that exist to add anime hair into Skyrim.  In the case of Fallout, the New Vegas mods designed to make the Legion more imposing are well intentioned (given the Legion playthrough is definitely less satisfying), but when extends to giving the Legion beautiful centurion armour, that's just lore-breaking, because there's no feasible way that the Legion had the capability to produce the armour; they have to just scavenge sports equipment, because they're actively anti-technology. I know that sounds like a petty complaint, but little things like that can really take me out of a game.  Balance  Another thing that 99% of Mods seem to have no interest in is game balance. This one, I think, is the clearest difference between a modder and an actual game developer. To be interesting, a game has to balance difficulty with what tools are available to you. And yet, whenever I see armour mods, the modder NEVER bothers to specify how good the armour is at defending you, or at what point in the game it's available. Aesthetics is all that matters, and the armour is often deliberately put in an immediately accessible location. The idea that it's giving the player something vastly too powerful, far too early doesn't even seem to register.  Progression/Reward  This one's the other side of the coin to balance. If I can use a Mod to just give myself, for example, an Airship Palace, why would I bother living anywhere else? Why I complete quests and spend money money equipping a small shack with stuff I want when I can just magic a Steampunk Unicorn Factory with a veranda and a chocolate fountain into existence? Mods that give you items and locations far 'superior' in some way than the items in the actual game render the entire actual game redundant, because any reward the game will give you is inferior to what you've just given yourself without putting any effort in.  So those are the main reasons I don't mod - and why I don't really go in for PC Gaming. Please do not yell at me too much."""
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,Cheesle,2,Mon Sep 8 10:09:30 2014 UTC,Thanks for finding that. There are very few people who can put it as eloquently as Jon.
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,Bookworm12k,1 point,Mon Sep 8 12:37:41 2014 UTC,The other side of the coin is many mods exist to make the game harder.  It could make for some very exciting viewing.
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,Rickasaurus,7,Fri Sep 12 03:14:06 2014 UTC,"Why? Because he likes to play on a console. Is that not reason enough?  A PC is better at one thing, a console is better at another. In the end it does not matter what you play with as long as you have fun.  ""PC > Console"" or ""Console > PC"" are <insert curseword>."
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,TOHSNBN,6,Mon Sep 8 10:57:14 2014 UTC,"I kinda prefer him playing it vanilla. It works better for challenge runs like these. Mods are often not well balanced, even if many try to be. Trying to do the YOLO run with Project Nevada and something like Welcome To Hell would end with a stupid premature death.  Other than that it doesn't really matter what platform he uses. PC is definitely better, but can be unstable. it's down to Preferences, I suppose."
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,ThimonTheLuff,3,Mon Sep 8 07:11:27 2014 UTC,"It's also much easier to record - capturing from consoles is easier, the files much smaller, and thus faster and easier to edit."

But could you not use the same hardware that captures the hdmi out of the console to capture the hdmi out of the PC? Just in theory.  Or when you play something like Hatoful Boyfriend you could stick to the same data format when editing.
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,TOHSNBN,-2,Mon Sep 8 13:22:02 2014 UTC,"Im not saying he has to use any overhauls, no. Sure, he'd benefit from it in normal gameplay but for challenge runs I would at the very least have some UI mods. And if not UI mods then maybe unofficial patches that fix some game breaking issues... you know, just the standard goodies. Hell, he could even add a nerfed Deathclaw companion, just for fun.  But then again.. That UI was made for consoles so I guess I can't say anything about that. I suppose I got too spoiled on Fallout (all bethseda games) mods ."
ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Sep 8 07:22:30 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say I've ever 'complained' I know the game so well - I enjoy adding freshness to the base game, sure, but that doesn't mean I don't love it anyway"

ManyATrueNerd,2fsdo3,SuperM737,5,Mon Sep 8 07:36:36 2014 UTC,This. Recording video and audio in the background can be somewhat resource intensive.
ManyATrueNerd,2foes8,ManyATrueNerd,10,Sat Sep 6 23:50:20 2014 UTC,"I wonder what the additional rules will be. Most fights can be avoided if you 'speech' them, and you're only forced into combat with raiders, thugs, wildlife, and a couple of scripted hostiles. And no-healing runs are easy if you speed-run. You can skip 95% of the game.  So there are going to have to be additional rules. It looks like Jon's going to start a fight with Vulpes, for example. Could this be a Kill-Everything Revisted? Perhaps just a ""Fight the Power"" ruleset, where all NCR, Legion, and Brotherhood must die, thus causing constant hit-squad spawns?  If he kills Vulpes in the beginning, then he misses his quest later in Caesar's tent, so what are the rules on quest completion?  Looking forward to finding out tomorrow."
ManyATrueNerd,2foes8,mikeburnfire,5,Sun Sep 7 03:33:25 2014 UTC,"It seems to be that at one point, when he was in the toilet stall, he was wearing NCR armour. So at some point either he was given or took that armour either for the high DR, or he could possibly be doing an NCR run. But at least he is going to run in vulpes/the legion, so we'll see how that goes."

ManyATrueNerd,2fneq2,abraxo_cleaner,1 point,Sat Sep 6 21:59:40 2014 UTC,"On the plus side, a ME3 no guns run should be quite feasible."
ManyATrueNerd,2fneq2,RC_Robert,2,Sun Sep 7 23:28:48 2014 UTC,I don't agree Ashley is the logical choice.   The goal of the mission is to explode the bomb.  The bomb is jury rigged from a salarian engine.  It needs an electronic expert like Kaiden to set up correctly.  When the time comes to choose who to save.  Picking Kaiden will leave the bomb undefended.  The bomb could be defused or even malfunction.
ManyATrueNerd,2fneq2,RC_Robert,7,Sat Sep 6 19:35:02 2014 UTC,"I'd say that you logically should go back to whoever is at the bomb - that has to be the priority.  Though I think Kirrahe mentions that the bomb is basically impossible to disarm once armed, hence it's ok to leave it alone."
ManyATrueNerd,2fneq2,theflyingcheese,2,Sat Sep 6 19:38:16 2014 UTC,Impossible for a Salarian to disarm maybe not for a Geth or a Reaper.  Leaving the bomb alone allows for the possibility of it malfunctioning.

She has some backwards views, but you're able to talk her out of them, and even without that she still goes with Kirrahe without any complaint. Her main issue is that due to her history, she's only experienced the alien races in a negative light, and thus things like letting them wander around the Normandy, the most advanced piece of tech the alliance has, seem pretty reckless."
ManyATrueNerd,2fneq2,Lolita_Humbert,2,Sun Sep 7 18:05:48 2014 UTC,"I know, I'm probably too cruel, but she makes a few really off comments, so I decided I'd just constantly be cruel to her this run"

ManyATrueNerd,2fkywl,skippythemoonrock,1 point,Sat Sep 6 16:21:25 2014 UTC,"Project Pigeon:       During World War II, Project Pigeon (later Project Orcon, for ""organic control"") was American behaviorist B.F. Skinner's attempt to develop a pigeon-guided missile.   The control system involved a lens, up to an array of three lenses at the front of the missile – using the same National Bureau of Standards-developed, unpowered airframe later used for the onboard radar-guided US Navy Bat glide missile – projecting an image of the target to a screen inside, while one to three pigeons trained (by operant conditioning) to recognize the target pecked at it. As long as the pecks remained in the center of the screen, the missile would fly straight, but pecks off-center would cause the screen to tilt, which would then, via a connection to the missile's flight controls, cause the missile to change course and slowly change the flight path towards its designated target.  Although skeptical of the idea, the National Defense Research Committee nevertheless contributed $25,000 to the research. However, Skinner's plans to use pigeons in glide bombs was considered too eccentric and impractical; although he had some success with the training, Skinner complained ""our problem was no one would take us seriously.""  The point is perhaps best explained in terms of human psychology (i.e. few people would trust a pigeon to guide a missile no matter how reliable it proved). The program was canceled on October 8, 1944, because the military believed that ""further prosecution of this project would seriously delay others which in the minds of the Division have more immediate promise of combat application.""

ManyATrueNerd,2fkj9t,slow_white_man,11,Sun Sep 7 00:21:16 2014 UTC,I found him through the Fallout subreddit. It was a post with gifs from some of the gnome shots in Tenpenny tower and I just had to check his videos out.  From a relatively new fan Jon it's great to see the channel growing like it is. Cant wait for your next Fallout series.
ManyATrueNerd,2fkj9t,awataurne,2,Fri Sep 5 20:06:29 2014 UTC,"""Gnomeshots"" sounds like something in one of those overedited MLG montages. The reality is much funnier and much more literal."

ManyATrueNerd,2fkj9t,MWGND,1 point,Sat Sep 6 06:04:37 2014 UTC,"I was on r/fallout and saw the ""Thank You"" post about the help with the Vegas Kill Everything. I watched the whole series ASAP. It is just amazing. Thanks, Jon."

For the first time in a long time I almost forgot about the pain, since then these videos have helped me through some long nights."
ManyATrueNerd,2fkj9t,Pepperyfish,4,Sat Sep 6 13:48:47 2014 UTC,"I actually reckon Goldeneye was one of the best videos I ever did - it's up there some of the stronger Fallout 3 parts, I think"
ManyATrueNerd,2fkj9t,ManyATrueNerd,2,Sat Sep 6 14:00:05 2014 UTC,"I would definitely put the Irish music and ""God damn it alek, for the last cocking time secret agent"" in the top 10 or 15 moments from any series."
ManyATrueNerd,2fkj9t,Pepperyfish,3,Sat Sep 6 14:04:22 2014 UTC,"The Jaunty Irish Music returned in Binary Domain & Singularity, and will continue to do so for any video featuring falling off a dam."

ManyATrueNerd,2fk54r,chalkman,2,Fri Sep 5 18:21:44 2014 UTC,Thanks for filling me in. This should be interesting.

ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,charlie_echo,10,Fri Sep 5 15:36:43 2014 UTC,"It's all live commentary as I record it. If I sound like I know what's happening, it's just because I've played the game a lot, so I know roughly what to expect.  In a very small number of instances, you may be seeing me replay something I already did, if I decide the footage isn't good enough during editing."
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,ManyATrueNerd,2,Fri Sep 5 15:57:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks for a quick response. Love your show, you have been inspiring me to start my own Let's Play series ... if I can find a reliable capture card that is."
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,ManyATrueNerd,6,Fri Sep 5 16:18:58 2014 UTC,"Elgato HD all the way - a little pricy, mind, but it's worth it.  If you're on PC, Fraps is much cheaper and very good as a starter tool"
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,GrahamOnions,1 point,Fri Sep 5 17:24:30 2014 UTC,Jon sorry to bother you but on Movie Studio Platinum what file format do you save the finished project as :P
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Fri Sep 5 18:02:58 2014 UTC,I think it's just a standard MP4
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,GrahamOnions,1 point,Fri Sep 5 22:28:42 2014 UTC,Thanks I got it uploaded but I think the bitrate was too low :( I used the software you said and it was great I done a decent job of the editing I think next time I need to make sure I don't cut so sudden :P Thank's for all the help man
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,ManyATrueNerd,1 point,Fri Sep 5 22:31:48 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't over think that side of things - I've never really paid much attention to that side, and nobody's complained yet  Basically, to my mind, as long as 720p is available, and FPS generally stays around 30, nobody tends to complain on quality"
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,GrahamOnions,1 point,Fri Sep 5 22:42:59 2014 UTC,Also if you do record on PC from what I know Open Broadcaster software is better than Fraps imo and most I've spoken to

In the recent weeks I bought the Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle and well I threw money in to mud as the thing does not work, and I would need to build a new computer for it to be compatible. So now I have to collect money for another few months in order to buy the new Elgato :("
ManyATrueNerd,2fk2w6,ManyATrueNerd,3,Mon Sep 8 08:25:42 2014 UTC,"Also, it's a great thing to do. It's flipping hard at first, but you will learn a lot of really cool skills"
