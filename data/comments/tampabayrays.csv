tampabayrays,3e76d6,Patrick_Surtain,2,Wed Jul 22 14:09:15 2015 UTC,Happy birthday
tampabayrays,3e76d6,underclass4,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:54:47 2015 UTC,Thanks!  It's the last year of being in my 20s before the dirty 30.
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,dullchristmas,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:26 2015 UTC,I don't think this is the year to sell at the deadline. The East is still pretty wide open and we also have a shot at the wildcard if that doesn't work out. Prospects are nice but at some point you have to play to win.
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,a_talking_face,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:25 2015 UTC,I agree.  I think that we need the veterans to step up and play ball.  I think pitching needs a change.  This will be a bigger challenge and show of skills and character for Cash more than anything to see how he handles the club.  Can he keep them in it mentally?  Can he stay in it mentally and not knee-jerk?   It would be great to bring in another franchise guy from somewhere but it won't happen and I don't think Ryan Howard will be that guy.  I mean he may be a 1/2 a season guy but that's only cause he is in the NL so he doesn't know pitchers but they don't know him either so he may be able to capitalize for half a season.
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,thegreatcerebral,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:46 2015 UTC,They might not be out of the running yet but something needs to change because they can't go all the way with what they're doing now.
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,one80oneday,2,Wed Jul 22 12:26:42 2015 UTC,"No, lots of ball to play and we're in contention. The rest of the division is as likely to tank as they ever are, and we can still put together some wins.   I just wish we'd go get a bat. I know we won't....but dang. If we were playing in Tampa, we probably would."
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,TheCenterOfEnnui,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:33:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess, it's just discouraging to see how hard we've fallen lately. If we did buy I'd like to see us go for someone like Adam Lind, but I don't see it happening either. I'm interested to see what happens in 2016 after we get the new TV deal and some contracts expire, we might actually start to see some real free agent signings."
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Wed Jul 22 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I understand why you would suggest that sell. Given what we're doing lately, it doesn't look great to move up strongly, but we're not dead in the water yet. BUT....I get where you're coming from."
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,mollarirulz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"The Rays strategy is to blame it all on the stadium issue.  They will get a new fat tv deal, but will not change their tactics until they have a new stadium, paid with tax dollars.  Remember, nothing is stopping them from building their own stadium."
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,skelder93,2,Wed Jul 22 12:24:03 2015 UTC,Other than the lease for the trop that runs through 2027 that they don't want to buy out of.
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,zbrasseur1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"No. They're not quite out if it yet. Plus, despite the mediocre performance this season there is still a ton of talent that could have an even better chance at a World Series run next year if things don't work out right now."
tampabayrays,3e4bn0,C0LL0C0,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"The way the offense is going, yes. Next year they'll have Cobb back, Moore will have the time needed to adjust and be as good as he can. It looks like the yanks won't be coming down anytime soon especially if they add a pitcher. The wild card race is too difficult with the Astros looking to pick up another pitcher and Minnesota doing what they've done. I'd say sell now and get some good offensive players to set us up for the next few years."
tampabayrays,3e41cc,RaysBot,4,Tue Jul 21 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"So here's what we need to do....shut the other team out, and have our pitchers hit home runs. Our path to success unveiled!"

tampabayrays,3difg5,LordNick72,2,Fri Jul 17 01:18:13 2015 UTC,I would trade away Colome but not Snell. He's been pitching very good this year and looks like he has potential to be a top-end starter down the road.
tampabayrays,3difg5,djz84,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:11 2015 UTC,Yikes I didn't know he was getting paid that much. That would put him up there with Longo as the most paid player on the team

tampabayrays,3demna,haflac,7,Wed Jul 15 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"If they needed some outfield help or even just a veteran presence on the team in three years, maybe. He'll be pretty cheap by then."
tampabayrays,3demna,zbrasseur1,5,Wed Jul 15 19:03:08 2015 UTC,If it's a very cheap deal for a bench/veteran role. Think Cliff Floyd's role in 08. If he still has value as an everyday player though he will likely be out of our price range.
tampabayrays,3demna,BentRods,4,Wed Jul 15 23:14:23 2015 UTC,Do we really want him back? Will he even be capable of putting up half of what he used to be? He's always hurt these days.
tampabayrays,3demna,millionaremattdavis,3,Wed Jul 15 18:11:37 2015 UTC,Not to mention he couldn't hit a barn if it was thrown at him. The dropoff in offensive production is just remarkable.

tampabayrays,3demna,clydefrog811,3,Thu Jul 16 10:09:17 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing that the Rays have always had, it's an abundance of talented outfielders. Crawford left, and Jennings replaced him. We lost Joyce and Myers to trades and Jennings to injury, and Kiermaier, Guyer and DeJesus have stepped up. If something happens to them, Boog Powell or Mikie Mahtook can get called up and fill in. I'm not worried a bit about the outfield, and I think bringing Crawford back would just complicate things more than is needed."
tampabayrays,3demna,matito29,3,Thu Jul 16 03:51:18 2015 UTC,"Only way I see this happening is if we needed to add depth late in the season, and he was available as a free agent. Maybe he could play a role similar to Baldelli in '08, of like Cliff Floyd as someone else mentioned."

tampabayrays,3dayf6,mjstoltz,7,Tue Jul 14 21:32:30 2015 UTC,.706 for the home teams upon your visits! (If I did the math right)
tampabayrays,3dayf6,anonymau5,7,Tue Jul 14 23:50:49 2015 UTC,Yup! You did! Not too bad eh?
tampabayrays,3dayf6,clydefrog811,6,Wed Jul 15 03:03:10 2015 UTC,Come back!

tampabayrays,3dbkrj,CooperEarly,5,Wed Jul 15 00:20:32 2015 UTC,I personally would pick Crawford over Zobrist but you can't go wrong either way.
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,Stlunatic6006,2,Wed Jul 15 05:06:30 2015 UTC,I actually had Crawford over Shields but yeah like you said I think they're all great players
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,2ndprize,2,Wed Jul 15 05:36:36 2015 UTC,Well that makes me sad.
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:50:46 2015 UTC,Why?
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,they_call_me_dewey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:05:12 2015 UTC,3 of those are still putting up great numbers... Just not for us. Feels bad man.
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,2ndprize,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:36:24 2015 UTC,Because the guys who are gone. You might as well have looked in my tshirt drawer to make this list. I'm never buying a Longo shirt just so I don't jinx him.
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,xiedian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:50:31 2015 UTC,Longo needs to get his shit together
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,xiedian,3,Wed Jul 15 14:43:29 2015 UTC,tbh I don't think were ever going to see 30+ HR Longoria ever again. I wish that we would play more like 2010 Longo though. Hit for a high average and just let the HRs come to him. So often we see him just swinging for the fences trying to get some RBIs but then he ends up striking out.
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,Orlandipo,3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really get it though, hes supposed to be in the prime of his career, he has a fat contract, he knows he's going to be the face of the franchise for a long time, and yet I could name plenty of 3Bs I would honestly rather have instead of him, based on his play. Don't get me wrong, I love him, but he's been nothing short of disappointing the last three seasons"
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,xiedian,2,Thu Jul 16 03:00:16 2015 UTC,Yeah honestly I think it's all in his head. I think he feels like he has to carry the team (which he kinda does) and so he's constantly swinging for the fences. If he just plays his game at his pace then I think we'll see the improvement
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,Orlandipo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Who would you rather have? Longo is the fifth best 3B in the MLB right now according to Fangraphs WAR, and top ten defensively in the MLB.   He's also been much better than people give him credit for in the past three years. His third highest WAR was in 2013. Higher than 2008 and 2011. Walks are up from last year. He's getting productive at bats.   I'm just not sure who somebody would want that isn't named Donaldson/Machado."
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,Najago,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly those two, along with Arenado, who is considered one of the best defensive players in all of baseball, who's also having a very very productive season at the plate. Longo is no slouch, and his defense is still amazing, but the way he's been producing at the plate concerns me, he's not showing the power that he's capable of, his strikeouts are too high, and its obvious he tries to do too much at the plate a little too often."
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,zbrasseur1,2,Thu Jul 16 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you would like to draft these people, because we would not be able to trade for them, and even if we sold the farm to get one of these players at least one of them (Machado) wouldn't sign a long term deal like Longo to stay with the team, due to him being a Boras client.   So instead of David Price, you would rather have Donaldson. Interesting.   Arenado we would've drafted in 2009, when Longo had just signed his first extension (6 year/17.5m), and was batting .294/.372/.507 with 33HR and had a fWAR of 7.1. We would also be passing on: Kyle Seager, Patrick Corbin, Jason Kipnis, Dallas Keuchel, Garrett Richards, Steven Matz , and Paul Goldschmidt by drafting Arenado. Still, I'll give you that Arenado would've been a better pick than who we ended up picking (and failing to sign). But there would've been a serious log jam at the 3B position.   In Longoria's case, HR (9) and ISO (.138) in 2015 are the only thing that is not in line with his career numbers, but that doesn't mean he isn't being productive. He leads the team in RBIs, and is tied for 2nd in HR on the team. Also the MLB average for ISO is .143, so he isn't far off of that.   Strikeouts are at 20.4%, which is lower than 2008 (24%), 2009 (20.9%), and 2013 (23.4%). Cabrera, Rivera, Butler and Souza are all striking out more than Longoria (Min 150 PA). that's also good for MLB Average (20.2%).  Longo is also walking 9.4% of the time, good enough for second best on the team. (Souza walks at a 10.4% rate) and is above the MLB average (7.4%).   Longoria has been very productive this year, and is one of the reasons this team continues to be competitive. I'll take Longo over any other 3B in the MLB. I'm def biased, but based on his defense, production and team friendly deal, there is no one else I'd rather have."
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,blackxhawk69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"Kris Bryant, Matt Carpenter, Todd Frazier, Nolan Arenado are all looking way better too."
tampabayrays,3dbkrj,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:49 2015 UTC,Crawford should be included. He was ridiculously good during his time here.
tampabayrays,3d2sve,TheCenterOfEnnui,4,Mon Jul 13 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"Again, as nice as the lady may be, I found my lucky Game Ball from T-ball, that got us the series. /joke  In all seriousness, But what's been concerning me has been looking into Drew Smyly... He's been given a time table to return in August... but he tore he Labrum. You get surgery for that, it just doesn't heal on it's own.   Are the Rays trying to intentionally sabotage Smyly's career, to make him a cheeper player or something? How in God's name can he come back from tearing a ligament in his shoulder that doesn't heal on it's own to pitch two months later?"
tampabayrays,3d2sve,Rays8JenningsFan,6,Mon Jul 13 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"College pitcher here who's seen a few teammates over the last four years go down to torn labrums (labra?). The surgery has a very low success rate (it's not like Tommy John). What does tend to produce better results is a well-crafted rehab program and full commitment on the part of the pitcher (which I don't doubt we have in the Rays staff and Smyly). Our guys have seen good results with rehab, one of which was arguably our best this year."
tampabayrays,3d2sve,il_conto_mio,4,Mon Jul 13 17:01:06 2015 UTC,But.. It was only partially torn right :(
tampabayrays,3d2sve,xiedian,3,Mon Jul 13 05:06:51 2015 UTC,I read somewhere he already had the surgery with the Tigers in the past so that's why they are seeing if he can still pitch
tampabayrays,3d2sve,psaepf2009,2,Mon Jul 13 07:09:57 2015 UTC,I take full credit for any and ALL Dejesus performance. Good and bad. Yesterday I tossed his HR ball around during the game and LO and behold he hits a damn TRIPLE!
tampabayrays,3d2sve,Nick_named_Nick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:43:57 2015 UTC,"I believe the correct terminology is torn labia, and that only happens when you fuck get to hard."
tampabayrays,3d0saz,CooperEarly,4,Sun Jul 12 15:43:09 2015 UTC,We recalled Tim Beckham to take his place. Him and Elmore will probably rotate at SS.
tampabayrays,3d0saz,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 15:44:26 2015 UTC,"He was heating up too... Hopefully he can rest up, and leave where he left off."
tampabayrays,3d0saz,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jul 12 20:21:51 2015 UTC,"Jeez I know, such bad timing. His .993 fielding% will be missed as well"
tampabayrays,3d0saz,millionaremattdavis,2,Sun Jul 12 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, not the worst timing in the world... only ten days thanks to the All-Star break, and we have a two day break between the Phillies and O's series... he should be back for the Tigers."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,RaysBot,3,Sun Jul 12 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"That'll do Raysbros, that'll do."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,han__yolo,5,Sun Jul 12 23:04:56 2015 UTC,"Second Place, guys! No one is safe!"

tampabayrays,3d0j60,xiedian,4,Sun Jul 12 19:53:30 2015 UTC,Not deep enough!!
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,6,Sun Jul 12 19:52:38 2015 UTC,ALL STAR BOXBERGER WITH THE SAVE
tampabayrays,3d0j60,CooperEarly,5,Sun Jul 12 19:52:29 2015 UTC,Nice Win! Great Win for Moore!  Just need a little help from Boston (down 3) and for the Nats to stay in control.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sun Jul 12 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Fuck Boston, they can rot. Someone else will beat the Yankees."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jul 12 19:53:09 2015 UTC,They're still in last place... they can win all they want if they stay in that spot.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want to risk it!    Have you seen how peaceful /r/baseball has been without all the fair weather Boston fans? Its amazing.    Edit that said, I am going to catch the end of this Red Sox Yanks game. Looks like its a good one."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jul 12 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"I'm far more of a /r/nfl guy, I actually know what I'm talking about there anyway...  Still, I hate the Yankees more than the Sox (if only slightly) and being 2.5 back is more than a enough of a middle finger to give to the rest of the division."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jul 12 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite, I know a lot about baseball (played through college) and followed since the early 90s.    NFL, I'm just coming into that in the last 3-4 years. Football is A LOT more complicated than I thought 5 years ago.     You've changed my mind about this Yanks/Sox game...go Red Sox!"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jul 12 20:00:16 2015 UTC,Don't go that far... just Fuck the Yankees.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jul 12 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"I, too, am rooting for Boston.  The Yankees need to lose as much as possible."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,FuriousTarts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, I guess on the flip side, we have to deal with all the fair weather Yankees fans...and there A LOT more Yankees fans who just do not pay attention unless their team is winning."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jul 12 19:59:00 2015 UTC,:)
tampabayrays,3d0j60,PinheadRecords,5,Sun Jul 12 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"Its one game in the grand scheme of things, but going into the AS Break over .500 would mean a lot."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,5,Sun Jul 12 19:48:44 2015 UTC,"Ah shit, Boxberger with a one run lead. I'm going to hide under my bed."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,4,Sun Jul 12 19:48:23 2015 UTC,Hickey is the fuckin' man. He's the only reason I wasn't worried about losing Friedman/Maddon.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,6,Sun Jul 12 19:47:56 2015 UTC,Jim Hickey is the Rays... he needs to be under contract for life.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sun Jul 12 19:47:16 2015 UTC,C'mon Jaso. Take a look at the Outfield before you run. They were shaded so far right.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jul 12 19:45:28 2015 UTC,Why bunt? we're only at first.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jul 12 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"Whether it's Boxberger or McGee, they gotta pull through for Moore, the W would mean a lot to him going forward."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"Damn, that was absolutely smoked. Didn't even know he could get to 96"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,xiedian,4,Sun Jul 12 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"Whew, nice catch!"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,5,Sun Jul 12 19:22:03 2015 UTC,This bullpen is gonna make me shit my pants.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,FuriousTarts,3,Sun Jul 12 19:21:31 2015 UTC,Awesome grab by DeJesus! This game seems like it's been going forever...
tampabayrays,3d0j60,PinheadRecords,5,Sun Jul 12 19:21:04 2015 UTC,Paging /u/mjstoltz I hope ya made it to the Trop!  edit: oops forgot to check Twitter! https://twitter.com/Biking4Baseball/status/620278662487744513
tampabayrays,3d0j60,anonymau5,4,Sun Jul 12 19:07:41 2015 UTC,So good to have Loney back. We need those guys that will give consistent ABs.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jul 12 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"How did Moore look today?    My main concern with him was always arm side fastball sailing, did he have any of that to righties?"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,5,Sun Jul 12 19:06:29 2015 UTC,"He made some quality pitches to the batters he faces today, but once again his command wasn't exactly there. Also, his velocity isn't where I thought it would. It's to be expected, but a little disappointing thus far"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,xiedian,3,Sun Jul 12 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"Where was he sitting velo-wise? Low 90s, at least, right?"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jul 12 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Some got there, but from what I saw he threw ALOT of pitches in the 88-89 range"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,xiedian,3,Sun Jul 12 19:21:22 2015 UTC,"It's odd how everything was going terrible, to now all the games are going our way... I'm not complaining at all, I'll take it!  Nats are up, BoSox are up, and we're up... all in place to take second and be only 2.5 back after an absolutely putrid three weeks."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 19:02:43 2015 UTC,Phew
tampabayrays,3d0j60,zeitfalle,6,Sun Jul 12 19:02:00 2015 UTC,Walking the 9 hole on a non-competitive pitch makes me livid.  Edit: Whew. So much unnecessary sweat.
tampabayrays,3d0j60,FuriousTarts,4,Sun Jul 12 18:59:33 2015 UTC,So....how long has John Jaso looked like MacGruber?
tampabayrays,3d0j60,leflerized,3,Sun Jul 12 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"Since he dyed his hair in Oakland. Nevermind, he dyed his hair and went to dreads this offseason."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jul 12 18:54:53 2015 UTC,SIZEMORE RBI!
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sun Jul 12 18:42:26 2015 UTC,Back in the lead!!
tampabayrays,3d0j60,PinheadRecords,6,Sun Jul 12 18:42:22 2015 UTC,JUST TAKE THE NEXT PITCH! IT WILL BE A RUN SCORED!  EDIT: YES! TIE GAME! TOOK THE WALK FOR A RUN SCORED! WE FINALLY LEARNED!
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 18:40:45 2015 UTC,he looked surprised as you are.  4 balls = walk?
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Grasschoppa,3,Sun Jul 12 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"This team seems to forget that they are allowed BBs at all... We go up 3-0, 3-1 so often and find away to strikeout."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"Brutal.  Astros and Tampa Bay seem kinda similar in that regard.  We strikeout or home run mostly.  Would like to see us as a better contact hitting team, Valbuena has more homeruns than doubles for example."
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Grasschoppa,3,Sun Jul 12 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"I get you guys have a really low pay roll these days, but we're the prototype of a Low budget team... so HRs don't come often for us... so it means we just don't score at all. 4 Runs is an oddity, but I welcome it... And flair up buddy. :)"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jul 12 18:52:56 2015 UTC,Ooo this is a nice Stros flair.  Nice!

tampabayrays,3d0j60,YoungDirk,4,Sun Jul 12 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"Bases Loaded... Can Jaso just get on, that's his specialty. It's a run if he can just get on.  NATS ARE UP! If we can pull this out, and Nats hold on, we're in Second!"
tampabayrays,3d0j60,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:00 2015 UTC,Come on Casali

tampabayrays,3d0j60,Grasschoppa,3,Sun Jul 12 18:25:06 2015 UTC,So much for second place...

tampabayrays,3d0j60,nosajx7,2,Sun Jul 12 15:43:26 2015 UTC,Here's to Matty Mooregetting his first Dub and lowering that ERA!
tampabayrays,3d05mo,juicemagic,2,Sun Jul 12 10:57:36 2015 UTC,He was the bullpen a lot because he had to. A lot of these starters would get lit up the third and fourth time through the lineup. Relievers generally only pitch an inning since you don't want them to tore out and blow the game.
tampabayrays,3d05mo,chalupa_lover,2,Sun Jul 12 13:36:36 2015 UTC,The pitching has been fine. The hitting has been subpar. Longo is no longer an elite bat as well.

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sat Jul 11 22:48:46 2015 UTC,We've had a lot of success in recent years with putting pitcher's returning from injury up against the Astros. Get em right back on top.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 22:50:58 2015 UTC,God damn Joey Buts has been in a slump lately.

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sat Jul 11 22:41:27 2015 UTC,SEND JB DOWN ALREADY
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,4,Sat Jul 11 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"Relax, he's hit a slump. He might not be a .340 aver age kind of guy but he has a career average of .290. The reason he never had a chance before is because he spent the majority of his career in the Rangers organization, where they have had a surplus of bats. I'd much rather take a joey butler over a nick franklin anyday."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,C0LL0C0,2,Sat Jul 11 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"Well, you may be right, but once Souza comes back, I don't see JB having a place on the roster anymore."

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,6,Sat Jul 11 22:21:23 2015 UTC,most nonchalant ejection ever
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,PinheadRecords,4,Sat Jul 11 22:20:51 2015 UTC,What just happened
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,3,Sat Jul 11 22:20:46 2015 UTC,Nice Rivera... Why can't you hit like this more often.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"Awww, man, I wanted to see Rivera go for 3."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 22:18:18 2015 UTC,That Correa kid is fuckin' good.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 22:16:48 2015 UTC,Thats not fair..

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 22:02:06 2015 UTC,Still feel like he should be the closer over Box.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,4,Sat Jul 11 22:04:40 2015 UTC,Totally agree.     Box concerns me in a few ways. He needs to figure out how to not give up so many homers.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"What do we have left from that '08 team? Just Longo, right?    Damn."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jul 11 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, to be fair, we've traded all the players for the Current starters... The Part of the Shields trade everyone forgets just gave us 5.2 good innings... and the other parts turned into Souza and Ramirez."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, I know. Its just interesting, but I guess its been 7 years."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck this waste of time, dude is out, get on with the game."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jul 11 21:56:23 2015 UTC,Happy to kill the review system. Adds nothing to games in my opinion.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,colwell25,4,Sat Jul 11 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"I'm alright with replay, I just don't like it when we try to game it. The neighborhood play is fine. Let it stand unless it gets Todd Helton egregious."

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jul 11 21:55:24 2015 UTC,He's swinging at stuff he normally doesn't... I think he's gotta good chance to correct that and have a productive career as as role player.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jul 11 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"Hey , it was fun while it lasted"
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,4,Sat Jul 11 21:55:57 2015 UTC,So you guys going to let us win one?  Astros > Angels
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,HardandGlorious,5,Sat Jul 11 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry dude. The Royals fuckin stomped us, we need some morale going into the break."

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 21:54:20 2015 UTC,Should went for two Forsythe! Good Hit!
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"Odo! Almost like he didn't miss any time at all. Great first start back. Wish he was able to make the ASG, he's had an amazing first half."

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sat Jul 11 21:41:39 2015 UTC,Any word on Cabrera? I just started watching and I saw in the game recap he was hurt?
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,vkw619,3,Sat Jul 11 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Right hamstring strain. No timetable yet, he won't be back for this game though"

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 11 21:33:48 2015 UTC,So Jaso has nothing left in the tank as a Catcher?
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"i dont think so, i dont remember him being a very good catcher, and definitely not as good as rene"
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,haflac,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:37:44 2015 UTC,I wasn't thinking as an Everyday guy... but just be able to play the position at any amount at all.

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,haflac,3,Sat Jul 11 21:45:22 2015 UTC,Too many concussions. Can't risk him back there.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jul 11 21:33:32 2015 UTC,Concussions? That common as a Catcher? (Still a newer fan)
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"They can be, some catchers are unlucky. Getting hit with a bat, baseball, etc can cause one.    Also, having a concussion can make you susceptible to another. They are somewhat cumulative, especially if you try to play through one."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jul 11 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"Well I know that one Concussion can make it easier to get others (My mom is a Cowboys fan, so remember Aikman. Also Steve Young.)"
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 11 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"Somewhat, you've got to worry about foul balls into the mask and even batters with huge backswings hitting him with a bat."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,JoebobZanzibar,4,Sat Jul 11 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"All our runs on 2 out RBIs!?    What are we, the Royals now?"
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,zeitfalle,4,Sat Jul 11 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, just got home. Did not expect us to put up runs on Keuchel.    nice work, O!"

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"Big strike out... Big strike out.  And so far, just a strain on Cabby, hope that's that."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jul 11 21:07:47 2015 UTC,lol that was such a sad swing
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,4,Sat Jul 11 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"Got to admit, that was great pitch, stayed in the zone before it spun just out of it."
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sat Jul 11 20:50:47 2015 UTC,Not assdribble noooooo :(
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Nick_named_Nick,5,Sat Jul 11 20:44:07 2015 UTC,This Pitchers have almost identical ERAs... and look at there records.
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jul 11 20:42:17 2015 UTC,Exactly why wins shouldn't determined how good a pitcher is or isn't. All bout that run support
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,5,Sat Jul 11 20:45:04 2015 UTC,"It's not the worst measure... but it's only a really small factor, ERA is the most important factor (perhaps ERA- to be technical.)"
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 11 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"After that swing in miss, I was just getting done putting down Guyer... and then he gets a nice hit! It's fine to prove me wrong if it means outdoing yourself!"
tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jul 11 20:40:53 2015 UTC,But wait there's more!

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,xiedian,3,Sat Jul 11 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"OH NO! Please be a Cramp, we can't lose him with how awesome he's been playing lately. Cabby has almost carried this batting order.  Please just be a cramp."

tampabayrays,3cxf9n,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 11 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"The thing I hate most of the decline we've been on is that Cabby got hot, but the rest of the team crapped all over themselves, and we failed to take advantage... Hopefully it all ended last night.  Not the Hot streak, the Cold streak."

tampabayrays,3comqa,Scory22,6,Thu Jul 9 21:10:07 2015 UTC,Bad.

Now that we can't even rely on our SPs to give us a good outing , especially with our ace giving up NINE runs, I don't know what you can do. When we do put up runs, our pitching staff completely blows it. We aren't the type of team that relies on our offense, we value quality starts and good relief outings. All-star break just needs to come already."

tampabayrays,3comqa,PinheadRecords,5,Thu Jul 9 18:12:19 2015 UTC,Why would you put Jaso in left and have Dejesus DH?  Makes no sense to me at all?

tampabayrays,3comqa,pokerfacetwin,7,Thu Jul 9 15:28:55 2015 UTC,I can't because the Papa Johns near me doesn't honor the codes :/ Their pizza's been kinda shitty lately though so eh...
tampabayrays,3comqa,PinheadRecords,5,Thu Jul 9 17:33:48 2015 UTC,Pizza can only do so much....
tampabayrays,3comqa,Kjcool2,5,Thu Jul 9 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"True, but also you have to consider that it could be a long time before they score 6 runs again."
tampabayrays,3ck64l,CooperEarly,9,Wed Jul 8 15:27:40 2015 UTC,:( we were doing so well
tampabayrays,3ck64l,DylanRamsey,6,Wed Jul 8 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean as much shit as we're giving them I think they'll do better after the ASB. With Archer-Rizzi-Moore-Karns-Ramirez we won't have to rely as much on them as we did the first half. Hopefully the ""bullpen games"" are not going to return"
tampabayrays,3ck64l,newtothelyte,8,Wed Jul 8 18:42:58 2015 UTC,Bullpen is burnt out. They are overworked and the effects are starting to show. Hopefully the AS break will help them out
tampabayrays,3ck64l,backintheussr1,8,Wed Jul 8 19:17:37 2015 UTC,Our team*
tampabayrays,3ck64l,BetterOffLeftBehind,2,Wed Jul 8 16:41:15 2015 UTC,That isn't a large enough dumpster or a big enough fire.

tampabayrays,3cljid,RaysBot,-4,Wed Jul 8 21:10:07 2015 UTC,This team is a joke. I can't invest any more time or emotion. Im checking out before I develop high blood pressure or some sort of depression. Peace Rays bros.
tampabayrays,3cljid,YouEnjoyMyself84,11,Thu Jul 9 03:05:32 2015 UTC,Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
tampabayrays,3cljid,BRod_Angel,5,Thu Jul 9 03:53:21 2015 UTC,"Bah, well shit, at least we made one of these games close.    Royals are one of the most fortunate teams I've seen us play this year."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,2,Thu Jul 9 03:03:56 2015 UTC,The first game was close.
tampabayrays,3cljid,edcba54321,5,Thu Jul 9 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"I guess it was technically, despite the 4 run difference."
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,5,Thu Jul 9 03:57:23 2015 UTC,"God fucking dammit, stop playing with my emotions Rays. This hurts so bad."
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,7,Thu Jul 9 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"Gah, that tease.  Still don't understand pinch hitting Sizemore there... fucking guy is now 0-11 in this series, wtf."
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,5,Thu Jul 9 03:02:56 2015 UTC,That's what I get for turning the game back on when I said I was done.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,5,Thu Jul 9 03:02:52 2015 UTC,"C'mon, Grady!"
tampabayrays,3cljid,JV19,7,Thu Jul 9 03:02:18 2015 UTC,hahahahah oh shit this is great

tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,3,Thu Jul 9 03:01:35 2015 UTC,Oh God why are we putting in the guy who's 0-10 in this series...
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,5,Thu Jul 9 02:59:18 2015 UTC,Sizemore pls
tampabayrays,3cljid,YoungDirk,5,Thu Jul 9 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"Alright Cash, hit and run on a double steal. Do it!"
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,5,Thu Jul 9 02:59:06 2015 UTC,"C'mon Logan, hit another one here!"
tampabayrays,3cljid,JV19,5,Thu Jul 9 02:57:36 2015 UTC,What is this offense? Did I change the channel to another game or am I hallucinating?
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,5,Thu Jul 9 02:57:14 2015 UTC,Is this real life?
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,8,Thu Jul 9 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"""That wasn't enough yards for a first down!""    -KC fans"

tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,9,Thu Jul 9 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"If you had told me ''the Rays will score at least 5 today, and Archer is pitching'' I would have never thought we would lose this game."
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,2,Thu Jul 9 02:53:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Royals weakness has been rookie pitchers.  We wreck veterans and aces."
tampabayrays,3cljid,edcba54321,7,Thu Jul 9 03:24:47 2015 UTC,Archer gave up 9 runs. 9.     Fuckin' crazy.    I blame at least 3 of those on Forsythe playing shit defense and another 3 on Guyer having his head up his ass.    But still.
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"Career high for him, not a good night for him at all. Especially since it's his last start before the ASG"
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,6,Thu Jul 9 02:56:22 2015 UTC,Don't tease me Rays
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,4,Thu Jul 9 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"One more. Just one more, I want my pizza"
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,3,Thu Jul 9 02:50:33 2015 UTC,"And to think I wanted to go to KC to watch this series live, since I live 4 hrs from there now, but after the dumpster fire we had, I'm so glad that didn't happen."
tampabayrays,3cljid,svanxx,4,Thu Jul 9 02:50:20 2015 UTC,I swear they're doing this just to give us a sliver of hope before they tear it all down again.
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,3,Thu Jul 9 02:50:08 2015 UTC,One foot higher and that woulda been out. Fuck.
tampabayrays,3cljid,PinheadRecords,4,Thu Jul 9 02:49:54 2015 UTC,Nice garbage time hitting here
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"What the hell are you guys feeding Jaso,  getting hits like clockwork."
tampabayrays,3cljid,uwanmirrondarrah,2,Thu Jul 9 02:48:21 2015 UTC,Oh and you too Jaso. I'm really wishing we had you all season right about now.
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,4,Thu Jul 9 02:48:12 2015 UTC,Do it all Rene. Do it all.
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,4,Thu Jul 9 02:46:29 2015 UTC,The fuck is that shit
tampabayrays,3cljid,PinheadRecords,10,Thu Jul 9 02:45:32 2015 UTC,I'm hearing rumors that the Tampa bay broadcasters are not impressed with our bbq.
tampabayrays,3cljid,alfrednugent,7,Thu Jul 9 02:41:37 2015 UTC,These losses wouldn't sting as much if they would at least score six runs more often. At least we'd be getting pizza for half the price.
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,3,Thu Jul 9 02:40:16 2015 UTC,I had someone ask me today to tell her when the Rays score 6 runs so she can take advantage of the deal. I told her not to hold her breath lol.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 02:42:29 2015 UTC,Oh... And got to love the barbecue commentary!
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 9 02:32:17 2015 UTC,Could someone local please get that inflatable chair and mail it to me in Ohio? It would complete my inflatable loving room set! :)
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,4,Thu Jul 9 02:30:09 2015 UTC,Kids 14 + under only. :/
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,3,Thu Jul 9 02:32:19 2015 UTC,If I still lived in St Pete I'd take my friend's kid just to get it.
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 9 02:35:01 2015 UTC,Longo finally gets a hit! Someone tell me  why we have 7 more years with him? He's been so disappointing this year....
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 9 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"He's still great at 3B, but I agree his bat has been seriously lackluster."
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 02:21:59 2015 UTC,But like most of the team this year... Defense doing well.  Longo looks good but I see Cabby picking up all the slack.
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,6,Thu Jul 9 02:24:45 2015 UTC,can you guys spare some offense?
tampabayrays,3cljid,fightinchunk,6,Thu Jul 9 02:20:25 2015 UTC,"Outside of garbage time, we don't have any."

tampabayrays,3cljid,fightinchunk,2,Thu Jul 9 02:55:05 2015 UTC,"This was definition garbage time. We have hits/runs, but can't finish. We scored 4 runs off of some dude that they put on the mound because they were up by 6."
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,3,Thu Jul 9 03:10:16 2015 UTC,YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,5,Thu Jul 9 02:19:53 2015 UTC,The 'rare' runners on and no outs double play.
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 02:18:45 2015 UTC,But dat Evan RBI tho
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 02:19:45 2015 UTC,first 2 out RBI of the season
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 02:20:26 2015 UTC,At least the Cubs/Cards game is interesting on ESPN... big comeback for the Cubs after being down 0-4
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 02:11:40 2015 UTC,I'm stuck with Indians post game on the other TV. Guess they'd change it if I asked nicely...

tampabayrays,3cljid,jstubb,5,Thu Jul 9 02:09:12 2015 UTC,This really isn't helping Archer's case to start the All Star Game.
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,5,Thu Jul 9 02:09:11 2015 UTC,BAHAHA WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,3,Thu Jul 9 02:08:50 2015 UTC,Seriously Guyer?!
tampabayrays,3cljid,YoungDirk,3,Thu Jul 9 02:08:41 2015 UTC,The fuck was that Guyer?
tampabayrays,3cljid,Scory22,5,Thu Jul 9 02:08:30 2015 UTC,Just pathetic.
tampabayrays,3cljid,PinheadRecords,5,Thu Jul 9 02:06:18 2015 UTC,Aaaaand I'm done for the night. Let me know if anything changes (not hopeful).
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,6,Thu Jul 9 02:06:12 2015 UTC,sigh
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 02:05:36 2015 UTC,Great gif.
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,4,Thu Jul 9 02:17:02 2015 UTC,"""This is what I looked like the last time the kids didn't clear the kitchen table.""  WTF commentators???"
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,4,Thu Jul 9 02:03:47 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing haha
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,6,Thu Jul 9 02:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yes ba, it could be that or it could be that guyer was just like ""Fuck this game"""
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,4,Thu Jul 9 01:57:32 2015 UTC,It was only a 3 run deficit at the time in only the 5th. It's not like the game was already decided.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 01:58:40 2015 UTC,"True, although by rays standards that's how many runs they score a week, at least it seems that way."
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,3,Thu Jul 9 01:59:45 2015 UTC,Oh I know lol. I was considering making a mention of that in my last post.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,6,Thu Jul 9 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"I am a masochist, i can't stop watching this train wreck of a team."
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,10,Thu Jul 9 01:53:44 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the Rays announcers drive me off the wall. I know they have to stay positive, but there's just a limit of optimism that I just find infuriating if you cross.  Rays give up 7 runs: ""Well, Archer prefers putting up 0's.""... no shit."
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,6,Thu Jul 9 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, they feel the pain as much as we do.."
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,5,Thu Jul 9 01:54:06 2015 UTC,But they can't change the channel and be done with it sadly.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 01:55:25 2015 UTC,Wow.
tampabayrays,3cljid,mkultra3,5,Thu Jul 9 01:52:52 2015 UTC,Well hopefully Archer can go deep since he's not pitching again till the break (I think) and we can rest the pen.
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 01:52:37 2015 UTC,Wow.
tampabayrays,3cljid,mkultra3,3,Thu Jul 9 01:52:31 2015 UTC,I go pee and WHAT THE FUCK DID I MISS?!?!?!
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 9 01:52:21 2015 UTC,WHAT IS HAPPENING
tampabayrays,3cljid,PinheadRecords,6,Thu Jul 9 01:51:47 2015 UTC,What else is on tonight?
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're me, you get to watch the Mariners try to one up the Rays for atrocious play."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,6,Thu Jul 9 01:53:40 2015 UTC,"Really disappointing game all around. Poor defense, hitting, and pitching at very specific moments."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,5,Thu Jul 9 01:51:21 2015 UTC,Remember when we had a lead and the stadium was silent? Haha FML
tampabayrays,3cljid,JoebobZanzibar,4,Thu Jul 9 01:51:16 2015 UTC,Best 10 minutes ever.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,9,Thu Jul 9 01:52:04 2015 UTC,I would give you guys this game for Gordo's health
tampabayrays,3cljid,dovakiin1234567890,3,Thu Jul 9 01:54:12 2015 UTC,lol
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,4,Thu Jul 9 01:50:14 2015 UTC,Worst stretch of baseball I've ever seen these guys play.
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,3,Thu Jul 9 01:49:47 2015 UTC,somebody kill me.
tampabayrays,3cljid,PinheadRecords,4,Thu Jul 9 01:49:17 2015 UTC,Ahhh there's the Rays I know and love.  Fuck what an ugly game all around.
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,4,Thu Jul 9 01:48:12 2015 UTC,Game over.
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,5,Thu Jul 9 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"If we can't rely on Archer, who the hell can we trust?"
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,4,Thu Jul 9 01:47:26 2015 UTC,Come on Archer you're better than this.
tampabayrays,3cljid,YoungDirk,6,Thu Jul 9 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"Ah shit, he didn't even tag him"
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,5,Thu Jul 9 01:46:20 2015 UTC,Yup he's safe
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,2,Thu Jul 9 01:45:54 2015 UTC,He looked so out
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,6,Thu Jul 9 01:45:48 2015 UTC,"No, he's safe."
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,3,Thu Jul 9 01:45:28 2015 UTC,Yup.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,11,Thu Jul 9 01:45:46 2015 UTC,If Archer is hurt I will mourn with you guys
tampabayrays,3cljid,dovakiin1234567890,5,Thu Jul 9 01:42:50 2015 UTC,Archer getting a lot of balls hit right back at him today.    Reminds me of Farnsworth
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 01:42:34 2015 UTC,Why is Loney just conceding first?
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,6,Thu Jul 9 01:42:19 2015 UTC,Escobar is trying to kill Archer
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:42:04 2015 UTC,Wow do not go to the Royals game thread... for some reason they are complaining that our broadcast didn't show the injury enough for them?
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:08 2015 UTC,Just emotions getting to people. Misplaced emotions. A gordo loss would be absolutely devastating. Things have cooled off now. The more rational fans were calming them down lol.
tampabayrays,3cljid,pithuskerlover,2,Thu Jul 9 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"They were bothered by the guys calling it a home run while not mentioning that Alex hurt himself or something, idk I agree with you guys here"
tampabayrays,3cljid,theinsaneworld,2,Thu Jul 9 01:45:37 2015 UTC,What did they want Sun to show? They couldn't even figure out what happened at first.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 01:43:00 2015 UTC,Archer so intense
tampabayrays,3cljid,FuriousTarts,3,Thu Jul 9 01:33:40 2015 UTC,NICE catch Archer! Great play!
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,2,Thu Jul 9 01:30:43 2015 UTC,You'd think with 10 baserunners we would have had a few more cross the plate. Especially since they've been bunched into two innings.
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,2,Thu Jul 9 01:26:20 2015 UTC,LOL. Hits with RISP? Who do you think they are?
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,2,Thu Jul 9 01:26:59 2015 UTC,Only one run out of that..
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,4,Thu Jul 9 01:25:02 2015 UTC,If Guyer slides to the other side of the plate head first I think he's safe 10 times outta 10
tampabayrays,3cljid,CooperEarly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"Wow Guyer, you're a lot slower than I thought you were."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,2,Thu Jul 9 01:22:14 2015 UTC,It's not even that. The left fielder had a ton of momentum from running in to make the catch.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty weak throw, though. I would have thought Guyer scored easily."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:32:05 2015 UTC,Yeah but it was in left field and not too particularly deep with a guy coming in with momentum. I just think it was risky sending him in general.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm with you , it looked more like Guyer was tagging up, not even a sacrifice"
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:38 2015 UTC,Guyer you slow motherfucker
tampabayrays,3cljid,YoungDirk,2,Thu Jul 9 01:22:04 2015 UTC,Runs on runners in scoring position is a goooood sign!
tampabayrays,3cljid,mkultra3,2,Thu Jul 9 01:21:51 2015 UTC,Jesus guyer
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 01:21:17 2015 UTC,Rivera? ! ?
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 9 01:20:29 2015 UTC,There we go!  Rally on boys!!
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,5,Thu Jul 9 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"Twinsbro here, please destroy the Royals"
tampabayrays,3cljid,The_Only_Abe,4,Thu Jul 9 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"The way they've been playing against us, I'll take a narrow victory."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 01:19:28 2015 UTC,I'll just take a few good innings... but would love even a narrow victory.

tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"Mann, this does not look good. Really hope he's alright."
tampabayrays,3cljid,mkultra3,4,Thu Jul 9 01:11:48 2015 UTC,What just happened? I just hopped over to give you guys some support and suddenly I see injury reactions.
tampabayrays,3cljid,cardith_lorda,5,Thu Jul 9 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"Its really hard to tell, but Gordon got hurt and it doesn't look good."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,4,Thu Jul 9 01:13:24 2015 UTC,Alex Gordon is being carted off after chasing a ball to the wall. Looks like he took a very awkward step..
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 9 01:12:19 2015 UTC,Gordon just fucked his ankle or something really bad. Probably out for a while
tampabayrays,3cljid,theinsaneworld,5,Thu Jul 9 01:12:10 2015 UTC,Yikes! That sucks.
tampabayrays,3cljid,cardith_lorda,7,Thu Jul 9 01:12:32 2015 UTC,Can't see the game who got hurt?!
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,6,Thu Jul 9 01:10:54 2015 UTC,Alex Gordon
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,6,Thu Jul 9 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's not good."
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,3,Thu Jul 9 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, I hope its not an achilles.."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,6,Thu Jul 9 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"Fuckkkkkkkkkkk that looks bad...  Great hit, but damn man it takes the joy away seeing that happen.  Is that scored as a home run?"
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,2,Thu Jul 9 01:09:24 2015 UTC,Yeah if I were Logan I'd feel like the bad guy.
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,2,Thu Jul 9 01:12:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't. It absolutely sucks that it happened but Logan didn't do anything wrong. He did his job. He hit the ball and ran.
tampabayrays,3cljid,Mlacombe11909,3,Thu Jul 9 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yea, that will be an inside the parker."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 01:11:20 2015 UTC,Oh no...
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,4,Thu Jul 9 01:09:13 2015 UTC,Holy shit I hope he's ok
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,7,Thu Jul 9 01:08:45 2015 UTC,Sigh.
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 9 01:03:51 2015 UTC,Yep.
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,4,Thu Jul 9 01:05:43 2015 UTC,Hell yea! Rivera is a sniper
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,5,Thu Jul 9 01:02:08 2015 UTC,Why do people even try stealing off Rivera? It's a mistake.
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,5,Thu Jul 9 01:01:11 2015 UTC,So good to have Lonestar back!
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Jaso!"
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:45 2015 UTC,"Oh loney, you and your glorious slides"
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"If a player scores that reached base from a wild pitch, does it count as an earned or unearned run?"
tampabayrays,3cljid,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 9 00:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think wild pitches are officially scored as errors on the pitcher.  edit: But, they do get called earned runs. So I'm half wrong/ half right.   edit2: So I'm totally wrong. Ignore me."
tampabayrays,3cljid,lazybrouf,3,Thu Jul 9 00:49:24 2015 UTC,Wild pitches are not errors. They are just wild pitches.
tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jul 9 00:54:29 2015 UTC,Have to give it to him... That was a great catch by Cain.
tampabayrays,3cljid,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 9 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"I loved the Royals the last few years with the whole 'scrappy underdog' thing. Reminds me a lot of the Rays. Good to see a small market team having success.    Some of the Royals players (Escobar is what made me think of this) are little dbags, though."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"C'mon Rays, lets get to Guts."
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,4,Thu Jul 9 00:18:46 2015 UTC,We need to get this one.. For my sanity.

tampabayrays,3cljid,jstubb,7,Wed Jul 8 23:54:45 2015 UTC,Royals fans these days   They think they run the place
tampabayrays,3cljid,CooperEarly,5,Wed Jul 8 22:44:32 2015 UTC,That guy has always been a tool.
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,8,Thu Jul 9 00:19:37 2015 UTC,Eh don't let one asshole give you the impression of the entire fan base.
tampabayrays,3cljid,USCswimmer,-5,Wed Jul 8 23:41:18 2015 UTC,Really? I kin of got that impression 2012s all star game when they were booing like idiots.
tampabayrays,3cljid,C0LL0C0,4,Thu Jul 9 00:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the whole All star debacle really made a lot of people hostile in r/baseball lately, including me admittedly. I can't wait for this shots how to be over with"

tampabayrays,3cljid,millionaremattdavis,2,Wed Jul 8 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"We're .500 with a lot of games missed by our starting players, not that grim!"
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Wed Jul 8 22:38:54 2015 UTC,I wish I could get a stream of that quality for Jags games. It would make up for the poor quality of play.
tampabayrays,3cljid,grendel756,3,Thu Jul 9 00:30:05 2015 UTC,2015 is our year!
tampabayrays,3cljid,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jul 9 00:15:52 2015 UTC,Can this team please get a W tonight. Let's start a win streak before the AS break...
tampabayrays,3cixyi,lolyou22,4,Wed Jul 8 07:18:55 2015 UTC,"Yet, I still think McGee is being underutilized."
tampabayrays,3cixyi,SPRING_MOUNTAIN,3,Wed Jul 8 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Cash is putting Jepsen in way more often.  Even to close games, who has 5 losses.."
tampabayrays,3cixyi,xiedian,3,Wed Jul 8 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"McGee should be the closer. Boxy has a career HR rate over 1/9 and McGee is sitting at below half that.    Similar K rates, I just don't see why McGee is not getting the call.    The only thing I can think is that they are really easing him in, but hell, the kid used to be a SP before we converted him. There's strength in that arm."
tampabayrays,3cixyi,zeitfalle,2,Thu Jul 9 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, Mcgee is only used for MAX 3 outs. Even last year, if he came in during the 8th at any point he was pulled for the 9th. Why? He can get 3 outs but he mentally can't get 4 outs? I don't believe that."
tampabayrays,3cixyi,underclass4,3,Thu Jul 9 11:25:39 2015 UTC,McGee is easily the best arm we've got.
tampabayrays,3cixyi,GoljansBiceps,3,Thu Jul 9 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"As that article says, it worked well for a while. Seems to really be backfiring now. Hopefully the All-Star break can give some rest to the BP. Hopefully Moore gets into his groove so that we can have 2 starters without inning limitations."
tampabayrays,3cixyi,xiedian,2,Wed Jul 8 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"3, once Odo comes back"
tampabayrays,3cixyi,one80oneday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:25:08 2015 UTC,2 starters without inning limitations   They should stay out for 90-100 pitches regardless. Using the bullpen early even if the starter is getting crushed will only hurt the team in future games.
tampabayrays,3cixyi,one80oneday,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:59:08 2015 UTC,Couldn't be more true
tampabayrays,3cih29,xiedian,7,Wed Jul 8 04:08:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously, just watching these games hurts now. Hopefully all the players will perform better after the break."
tampabayrays,3cih29,Scory22,3,Wed Jul 8 06:02:36 2015 UTC,We have to go 46-30... it's painful to think about.
tampabayrays,3cih29,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Wed Jul 8 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think we can pull it off , especially once Odorizzi is back, he's a huge boost. We just have to hit in RISP for once.."
tampabayrays,3cih29,underclass4,3,Wed Jul 8 18:29:27 2015 UTC,It rough watching games past the 4th inning it's so bad to say. Hopefully Cash can do something to help us out after the break.
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,RaysBot,4,Tue Jul 7 21:10:16 2015 UTC,The bullpen absolutely SUCKS lately. My god.
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,SiXafraidSeveN,3,Wed Jul 8 03:22:33 2015 UTC,The Rays have been so painful to watch lately.
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,YoungDirk,4,Wed Jul 8 03:21:13 2015 UTC,I think Colome may actually be worse from bullpen than he is when starting...
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,PinheadRecords,3,Wed Jul 8 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"The rays started out the month of June 14 and 6, since then if they lose this game, they have gone 3 and 14."
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,C0LL0C0,7,Wed Jul 8 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"If the score stays this way, we'll be 1-9 in our last 10. I wasn't sure that was possible.  Fuck this sucks."
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,lazybrouf,4,Wed Jul 8 02:48:25 2015 UTC,Wasn't Derek Shelton supposed to be FIRED 4 Fuckin years ago?
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,citruscanned,6,Wed Jul 8 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"One thing is for certain, you know what's going to happen next, this team is just going to roll over and lose this game, there's no comeback because there's no will to win, no passion. So damn frustrating."
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,C0LL0C0,4,Wed Jul 8 02:35:54 2015 UTC,What a clusterFUCK of a season.
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,C0LL0C0,7,Wed Jul 8 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE. Bullpen is too damn tired. Fuck the injuries to the starters, fucked our whole season."
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,botts,3,Wed Jul 8 02:28:38 2015 UTC,Yup. Injuries derailed our season. We played well in the beginning of the year but now our bullpen is worn out from our starters going a maximum 5 innings every night. It's ridiculous. Not to mention when our pitching is shutting the other team down our offense decides to fall asleep( actually that's every game). Now the last two weeks we've seen that our bullpen cannot handle late game situations anymore and we losing close games left and right. Oh well. At least we got jameis Winston coming up
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,citruscanned,2,Wed Jul 8 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"Fuck Jameis, go Dolphins.  (no offence or anything, but Jameis is going to tank)"
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,botts,3,Wed Jul 8 03:18:09 2015 UTC,Blergh
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,zeitfalle,3,Wed Jul 8 02:28:07 2015 UTC,AH fuck!
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,grendel756,3,Wed Jul 8 02:27:40 2015 UTC,Will this end?
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,grendel756,3,Wed Jul 8 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"Sure Orlando, we hit you on purpose because you hit a homerun...    Sure."
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,zeitfalle,3,Wed Jul 8 02:13:27 2015 UTC,Does Cash thing he's a magician? That he can pull relievers out of his ass? Pardon my sass
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,xiedian,3,Wed Jul 8 01:58:39 2015 UTC,What a shitty way to concede a run
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,zeitfalle,3,Wed Jul 8 01:54:53 2015 UTC,"Do you guys think there's any chance that the Rays re-sign Jaso after this season? The concussions and injuries will probably bring his price down some, Dejesus will be gone and I'm pretty sure I've read that he lives in Clearwater during the offseason"
tampabayrays,3ch1bx,dullchristmas,4,Wed Jul 8 01:05:37 2015 UTC,There's a chance since he's pretty much a DH and not too many teams would need a player like that (especially a DH without power).

tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,6,Tue Jul 7 20:56:04 2015 UTC,He is out.  edit: Alright. I can live with that result. He was out though. :)
tampabayrays,3ccj29,lazybrouf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:56:32 2015 UTC,I agree
tampabayrays,3ccj29,shinymuskrat,3,Tue Jul 7 21:02:06 2015 UTC,HE WAS MILES OUT LEGOOOOOO

tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,5,Tue Jul 7 20:55:29 2015 UTC,Wade Davis coming in . we're fucked
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,7,Tue Jul 7 20:34:43 2015 UTC,I came here to ask what you all thought about Davis because it is hard to be objective as a Royals fan. This comment made me happy.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,shinymuskrat,5,Tue Jul 7 21:02:59 2015 UTC,"Easily one of the best relievers and arms in baseball, that transition from SP to reliever really helped him"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,3,Tue Jul 7 21:15:52 2015 UTC,well fuck
tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,6,Tue Jul 7 20:32:31 2015 UTC,Classic Jepsen
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,3,Tue Jul 7 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"Good afternoon folks, what a great game we have so far. Hope the whole series is this exciting."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,justplainjeremy,2,Tue Jul 7 20:28:02 2015 UTC,Nicee I'll take it
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,5,Tue Jul 7 20:27:16 2015 UTC,Butler reverting hard back to his AAA self
tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,5,Tue Jul 7 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"It was just a matter of time. At least we have Jaso back, I dont mind parting with Butler for a bit when we get Souza back."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,4,Tue Jul 7 20:26:02 2015 UTC,yeah - it's really astonishing we managed to get the production we badly needed out of him
tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,5,Tue Jul 7 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, he's been hard to watch bat lately. Lots of Ks"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,imperfectofcourse,3,Tue Jul 7 20:21:34 2015 UTC,Looks like he'll actually end up going back down once Souza comes back
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,2,Tue Jul 7 20:25:24 2015 UTC,Clutch...
tampabayrays,3ccj29,imperfectofcourse,6,Tue Jul 7 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"wow joey butts, that was your pitch!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,2,Tue Jul 7 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"Man, we got our fair share of Retreads to go with all the rookies."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,6,Tue Jul 7 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"1 Grady Sizemore home run, please."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jul 7 20:15:26 2015 UTC,Welcome back my man!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"Jaso 1-1 on the season, reached 2 times out of 2"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"Alright Jaso, finally got that batting average on July 7th!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,JoebobZanzibar,2,Tue Jul 7 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"Great hit by Jaso, anything into the outfield is a run scored."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:26 2015 UTC,Jaso keeping that 1.000 OBP going
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dullchristmas,2,Tue Jul 7 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"I miss watching Jaso, always has a good AB."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,3,Tue Jul 7 20:13:58 2015 UTC,Jaso! He's alive!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,colwell25,2,Tue Jul 7 20:12:15 2015 UTC,Think we used parts from Hanigan to bring him back?
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 20:13:31 2015 UTC,just look at those dread locks
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dullchristmas,3,Tue Jul 7 20:11:58 2015 UTC,Jaso's return.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"Not quite the ""no-brainer"" their broadcaster thinks it was!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,JoebobZanzibar,2,Tue Jul 7 20:11:04 2015 UTC,did his foot lift off?
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dullchristmas,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think they got the first out, though!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 20:08:27 2015 UTC,Err-Or!

tampabayrays,3ccj29,alfrednugent,4,Tue Jul 7 20:05:40 2015 UTC,There's trolls on Reddit? Reminds me of the ESPN comments back in the good ole days. lol
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Willtbsportsfan08,3,Tue Jul 7 20:01:53 2015 UTC,James Loney is a machine.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jul 7 19:50:57 2015 UTC,"Cool, this thread is over 20 hours old!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,alfrednugent,3,Tue Jul 7 19:50:38 2015 UTC,Double play!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,xiedian,4,Tue Jul 7 19:48:25 2015 UTC,What a play!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,2,Tue Jul 7 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"GOT'EM! Terrible decision to go there, we made him pay."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 19:46:45 2015 UTC,Couple good/great throws
tampabayrays,3ccj29,alfrednugent,2,Tue Jul 7 19:47:40 2015 UTC,Damn Royals need to start playing Clash of Clans again.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:36 2015 UTC,I'd rather vote Gardener...
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Tue Jul 7 19:31:21 2015 UTC,We got control back!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Tue Jul 7 19:19:35 2015 UTC,Anddddd it's gone
tampabayrays,3ccj29,imperfectofcourse,4,Tue Jul 7 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"I see the reason why a lot of Royals fans have become over inflated, the announcers aren't super profession. I mean, our guys (Staats and Anderson) are homers, but not ""Everyone is great"" homers, just ""We have our side in this race"" homers... these guys are the former."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,9,Tue Jul 7 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Small market team, low end of payroll spectrum and has made a hell of a run last year.   Sounds familiar, more power to them. If they rally to vote their players in to the All-Star game, other teams fans can either match em or shut up. I'm talking about the fans, not the announcers, those guys are lame. We are spoiled with Staats and Anderson, not many better in the league."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,pokerfacetwin,5,Tue Jul 7 19:24:20 2015 UTC,All the All-Star game propaganda they're spewing is making me nauseous
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,6,Tue Jul 7 19:20:22 2015 UTC,how is this a tie haha
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dullchristmas,5,Tue Jul 7 19:12:32 2015 UTC,I know 8 hits to 3 with two hit batters and an error
tampabayrays,3ccj29,pokerfacetwin,5,Tue Jul 7 19:17:21 2015 UTC,EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jul 7 19:12:32 2015 UTC,TIE GAME! I CALLED IT!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 19:12:27 2015 UTC,Now would be a good time for Longo to knot it up.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Tue Jul 7 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"C'mon, Matt... Don't hit this dude!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,2,Tue Jul 7 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Matt Moore, I mean, the heat it there, but he can't tame it."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 19:00:42 2015 UTC,All hail James Loney
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,2,Tue Jul 7 19:00:22 2015 UTC,Single handedly keeping us in it.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,talkintiki,3,Tue Jul 7 19:02:41 2015 UTC,Longo with an error.  We never win when that happens.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,talkintiki,3,Tue Jul 7 19:00:12 2015 UTC,this game man
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dullchristmas,5,Tue Jul 7 19:00:00 2015 UTC,What's the score guys?
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Willtbsportsfan08,2,Tue Jul 7 18:55:17 2015 UTC,3-3 now
tampabayrays,3ccj29,grendel756,5,Tue Jul 7 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"1-3. SOrry the GDT is not refreshing, froze up due to the double header."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,2,Tue Jul 7 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"Ah. That's ok, thanks. Not too surprised we're getting lit up. lol"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Willtbsportsfan08,6,Tue Jul 7 18:58:20 2015 UTC,3-1 Royals
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,2,Tue Jul 7 18:56:01 2015 UTC,We are so fucked in this game.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,talkintiki,2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:38 2015 UTC,Gotta go to work again.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Tue Jul 7 18:50:33 2015 UTC,You were 1 pitch from a Clean inning Moore!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jul 7 18:49:05 2015 UTC,pls kill me
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,5,Tue Jul 7 18:48:29 2015 UTC,I'm watching the game on MLB.tv and the only commentary available is the Royals guys and they are insufferable. All they want to talk about is how there whole team is all-stars and how they are lighting Moore up. Like bitch half of the guys on you're team who made the allstar game don't even deserve to be there
tampabayrays,3ccj29,CooperEarly,3,Tue Jul 7 18:47:56 2015 UTC,At least you're not blacked out from watching on MLB.TV.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,millionaremattdavis,2,Tue Jul 7 19:01:06 2015 UTC,DAMNIT... Hit the batter.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Tue Jul 7 18:46:56 2015 UTC,Not gonna be leading long if the bases are loaded at the bottom of every inning.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,2,Tue Jul 7 18:43:47 2015 UTC,Moore finally gets his first K of the game.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Tue Jul 7 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"So, KC can really hit these balls pitched right down the middle huh?"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,talkintiki,2,Tue Jul 7 18:36:36 2015 UTC,Is there a mobile friendly stream?
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Patrick_Surtain,5,Tue Jul 7 18:31:41 2015 UTC,WTF I literally step away for 5 seconds and we are up 1-0.  I guess I'll step away more often.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,FuriousTarts,3,Tue Jul 7 18:31:06 2015 UTC,Check in periodically.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,7,Tue Jul 7 18:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, please leave."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,talkintiki,3,Tue Jul 7 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't remember the last time the Rays had a lead in this stadium, GO RAYS"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,JoebobZanzibar,6,Tue Jul 7 18:30:35 2015 UTC,This team is so much better with Loney on it
tampabayrays,3ccj29,CooperEarly,3,Tue Jul 7 18:30:06 2015 UTC,I love having Loney back!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,5,Tue Jul 7 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"OH MY GOD, JAMES LONEY! HAVE MERCY!!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jul 7 18:29:19 2015 UTC,LONEY!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Tue Jul 7 18:29:11 2015 UTC,LONEY!!! WOOO WHAT A SWING!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,JoebobZanzibar,5,Tue Jul 7 18:29:07 2015 UTC,That was a hell of a double play.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,FuriousTarts,3,Tue Jul 7 18:28:25 2015 UTC,Wow what a play. That hit by Gordon was horse crap so I guess that makes up for it
tampabayrays,3ccj29,CooperEarly,3,Tue Jul 7 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Matty can settle in. Pitches looking flat today, curve isnt breaking as much as it normally does either..."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,4,Tue Jul 7 18:27:20 2015 UTC,Outstanding play!  Out of the jam.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,pokerfacetwin,5,Tue Jul 7 18:26:53 2015 UTC,"Holy shit I can't believe it's 0-0 after that, but I'll take it!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jul 7 18:26:42 2015 UTC,NO RUNS! WHAT A DOUBLE PLAY!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,6,Tue Jul 7 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Holy shit what a double play, hope Moore can settle in after that miracle!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,JoebobZanzibar,4,Tue Jul 7 18:26:35 2015 UTC,thank god!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dullchristmas,3,Tue Jul 7 18:26:25 2015 UTC,Phew!

tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"Forsythe, who should be an All-Star!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Tue Jul 7 18:25:22 2015 UTC,not so good a start.  Why is KC so tough on us? Seems like its been that way a long time.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,pokerfacetwin,3,Tue Jul 7 18:23:35 2015 UTC,Yeah everytime we go to Kauffman we get our butts kicked.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,3,Tue Jul 7 18:24:36 2015 UTC,Not the way you wanna start a game...
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,3,Tue Jul 7 18:23:31 2015 UTC,What the fuuuuuuuuuuuck
tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jul 7 18:23:02 2015 UTC,What's the reason behind skipping Colome? Or is he now pitching tonight?
tampabayrays,3ccj29,pokerfacetwin,3,Tue Jul 7 18:21:05 2015 UTC,I think they're transitioning him to the pen. He'll be there when Odo comes off the DL this weekend.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:22:59 2015 UTC,Because it's Matt Moore.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:22:24 2015 UTC,Joey Butts is not a Defensive guy.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Tue Jul 7 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind visiting the KC thread if we're all polite and such.  EDIT: Nope, they called us the Tampon Rays, fuck them. Let's see some French Revolution style Brutality on the Nobility!"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"Come over, be cool, and we'll love you.  Jesting is part of the game.  On a slightly related note, I am in Tampa, and can't seem to find the game on TV.  Is it blacked out or something?"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,edcba54321,3,Tue Jul 7 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"No, stupid TV contract."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:38:50 2015 UTC,Of all the asinine things to have happened.

tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,4,Tue Jul 7 18:18:24 2015 UTC,I guess we're using this game thread... Here's a stream of the Royals broadcast: http://zunox.hk/zxtv26.html

tampabayrays,3ccj29,PinheadRecords,3,Mon Jul 6 23:30:56 2015 UTC,No baseball tonight. Doubleheader tomorrow at 2pm and 8pm!!
tampabayrays,3ccj29,2015RaysTime,5,Mon Jul 6 23:24:35 2015 UTC,Thought they said the first game would be at 1 pm est.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,grendel756,4,Mon Jul 6 23:38:30 2015 UTC,1 pm at Kauffman Stadium. 2 pm in Tampa Bay.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,DrFoosball,5,Mon Jul 6 23:47:56 2015 UTC,Marc Topkin ‏@TBTimes_Rays  17m17 minutes ago Those were KC times - #Rays and #Royals will play at 2:10 and 8:10 Tampa Bay time
tampabayrays,3ccj29,2015RaysTime,5,Mon Jul 6 23:38:48 2015 UTC,They just announced the K is being evacuated. So official late start at least.  edit -no baseball :(
tampabayrays,3ccj29,justplainjeremy,4,Mon Jul 6 23:09:55 2015 UTC,"What's happening over there, pardon my ignorance?"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Mon Jul 6 23:18:55 2015 UTC,Lots of storm cells that can produce Tornadoes all around the area. Some Take Shelter warnings here in Kansas near the state line. No twisters hit the ground that I know of.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,justplainjeremy,3,Mon Jul 6 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information... If you live there, stay safe."
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Rays8JenningsFan,8,Mon Jul 6 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"im in KCMO and its pertty nasty here, super hard rain and thunder and possible tornados.  the real bad stuff is supposed to be gone in an hour but the rain will stay for 3-4 hours, so, not surprised the game is off. peep salvie's video... https://instagram.com/salvadorp13/"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,Jaylaw,5,Mon Jul 6 23:25:10 2015 UTC,This game isn't happening. Royals fan here. Huge storm and tornado warnings everywhere
tampabayrays,3ccj29,dovakiin1234567890,5,Mon Jul 6 22:47:24 2015 UTC,Are they trying to get this game in today? Weather is supposed to be pretty nasty.
tampabayrays,3ccj29,mkultra3,6,Mon Jul 6 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"It's bad right now, I've had sirens stop and start 4 times in last 45 minutes and I'm in Kansas about 20/30 driving minutes away from the K. They have take shelter warnings all over the metro right now"
tampabayrays,3ccj29,justplainjeremy,7,Mon Jul 6 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"Just a friendly heads up, keep an eye on the start time, there is a decent looking storm in Kansas right now headed over to the stadium. So cross your fingers I suppose. good luck guys! hoping to see you keep the Yanks and O's out of the playoffs by winning the East."
tampabayrays,3c96mt,carney620,8,Mon Jul 6 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"Looking at our history, only Longoria and Crawford have ever started the ASG for the Rays."
tampabayrays,3c96mt,TB_Dark,4,Mon Jul 6 02:50:32 2015 UTC,"I was hoping Archer would make the start, but he'll probably just be playing the game (will be exciting to see him in out there in a 1-inning stint, he could hit 99!!!) Reallllly hoping Forsythe can squeeze in there as well! He deserves it."
tampabayrays,3c96mt,mkultra3,2,Mon Jul 6 12:16:29 2015 UTC,"He's got a good chance. With Gray scheduled to start the Sunday before so I think it's down to Sale, Archer, & Keuchel. Unfortunately I think Sale will get it because he's been hyped with his strikeout games the past few weeks."
tampabayrays,3c96mt,TB_Dark,4,Mon Jul 6 18:33:39 2015 UTC,I think Keirmaier really deserves to be in there. His bat is just above league average and statistically he is THE best defensive player in the game
tampabayrays,3c72v3,RaysBot,3,Sun Jul 5 14:05:05 2015 UTC,Looks like Casali's got himself some new fans
tampabayrays,3c72v3,PinheadRecords,5,Sun Jul 5 20:10:27 2015 UTC,What a way to snap a horrible losing streak!
tampabayrays,3c72v3,PinheadRecords,10,Sun Jul 5 20:09:09 2015 UTC,it's been a while!!
tampabayrays,3c72v3,USCswimmer,4,Sun Jul 5 20:08:53 2015 UTC,Where was this in the last 7 games?!

tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,4,Sun Jul 5 18:49:13 2015 UTC,Should not have said that
tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,4,Sun Jul 5 18:50:10 2015 UTC,YOU BLEW IT!
tampabayrays,3c72v3,PinheadRecords,4,Sun Jul 5 18:53:40 2015 UTC,Quite an enthusiastic strikeout call
tampabayrays,3c72v3,PinheadRecords,2,Sun Jul 5 18:40:36 2015 UTC,Casali is a good hitter
tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,2,Sun Jul 5 18:25:14 2015 UTC,Well that more than makes up for that dumb HBP call
tampabayrays,3c72v3,PinheadRecords,3,Sun Jul 5 18:18:06 2015 UTC,Really? That hit him?
tampabayrays,3c72v3,PinheadRecords,5,Sun Jul 5 18:16:43 2015 UTC,Kiermaier's speed is crazy.
tampabayrays,3c72v3,grendel756,2,Sun Jul 5 17:36:21 2015 UTC,Oooh I like!
tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,2,Sun Jul 5 17:36:13 2015 UTC,What did I say about Loney haha? Nice to see some good first base plays!
tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"Damn, came in a little late and we go a two run lead. Nice!"

tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:13:52 2015 UTC,We gotta rally behind the troops! This is the time they need our support the most. If this continious I might buy some tickets and fly down to the trop for a game!
tampabayrays,3c72v3,Krapul,2,Sun Jul 5 17:04:21 2015 UTC,For my mental sanity we need the win this game. I have never hated a single insitution more than the Yankees and if they finish the sweep we continue this losing streak I will lose my god damn mind

Just distribute the losses to the rest of the leauge and send this guy's to the offsets on early. I know its a stupid idea, I don't care. The frustration cannot be expressed."
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,C0LL0C0,5,Sat Jul 4 19:58:40 2015 UTC,I'm going to take a week off from watching and I expect us to have a 5 game winning streak.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,xiedian,4,Sat Jul 4 19:56:07 2015 UTC,That was the most Un-American Thing I've ever seen.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jul 4 19:55:50 2015 UTC,God I feel sick. Why do I keep watching?
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,lazybrouf,5,Sat Jul 4 19:55:25 2015 UTC,Man that ending was some single a shit...
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,TheLivingInfinite,5,Sat Jul 4 19:54:36 2015 UTC,Didn't have a good feeling about it the moment Tex got his leadoff double. This is getting stupid.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,chalupa_lover,2,Sat Jul 4 19:54:24 2015 UTC,Fuck the Yankees.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,PinheadRecords,3,Sat Jul 4 19:54:18 2015 UTC,The Yankees didn't beat us. We beat ourselves by not executing.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,jeffreywithonef,5,Sat Jul 4 19:55:58 2015 UTC,This team is just reeling now. The pen has been awful
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,pokerfacetwin,3,Sat Jul 4 19:53:51 2015 UTC,WELP

tampabayrays,3c3qvu,millionaremattdavis,3,Sat Jul 4 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"They still have Miller available, so unless we get another run or two here, I think it is a repeat of last night."
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,pokerfacetwin,3,Sat Jul 4 19:41:02 2015 UTC,Miller is on the DL for us.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,JollehRoger,0,Sat Jul 4 19:44:42 2015 UTC,For the Pirates of the Yanks? haha Whats up with the nickname?

tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Krapul,8,Sat Jul 4 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"Again a leadoff double, strikeout, strikeout, groundout. This is getting so sad in these last few games."
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Krapul,5,Sat Jul 4 19:25:53 2015 UTC,Seroously. This is unacceptable.
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,C0LL0C0,3,Sat Jul 4 19:31:46 2015 UTC,Ugh.

tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Krapul,2,Sat Jul 4 18:18:46 2015 UTC,I hate that stupid face Teixeira makes so much
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,PinheadRecords,3,Sat Jul 4 18:05:41 2015 UTC,Why can we not lay down a god damn bunt? A FUCKING BUNT. That drives me insane.

tampabayrays,3c3qvu,jmarks850,0,Sat Jul 4 17:23:49 2015 UTC,I found the site a few days ago. The admins and mods are the old wiziwig staff. Very trustworthy!
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,jmarks850,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"You can see Souza was too tentative, minding the slump and was too passive. I rather see him be a little more aggresive, he is our best power hitter so with two on and two out he should've swing at those 2-0 and 2-1 pitches."
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Krapul,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:19:37 2015 UTC,"Loney! Love him coming back, now Souza dingeroonie?"

tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Krapul,2,Sat Jul 4 17:14:32 2015 UTC,No Dewayne :(
tampabayrays,3c3qvu,Krapul,2,Sat Jul 4 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"Couldnt watch yesterday's game, but I think its for the better because I would've blew a gasket haha! Let's go Rays!"

tampabayrays,3c12dk,juicemagic,4,Sat Jul 4 07:39:09 2015 UTC,The bullpen has been killing this team more than lack of run support. They're just giving up so many home-runs...
tampabayrays,3c12dk,SiXafraidSeveN,4,Sat Jul 4 03:55:21 2015 UTC,"When I saw Mccann walk up there, I knew it was over"

tampabayrays,3c12dk,not_dad,6,Sat Jul 4 03:46:48 2015 UTC,9 walks today issued by our pitchers
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,7,Sat Jul 4 03:41:43 2015 UTC,I haven't felt this sick about this team since they got eliminated by Texas in 2010 playoffs.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,C0LL0C0,4,Sat Jul 4 03:41:34 2015 UTC,I feel sick. This fucking sucks.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,PinheadRecords,2,Sat Jul 4 03:39:56 2015 UTC,Where was CJ? It was clear he was not cutting it.  Like ugh.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,FuriousTarts,3,Sat Jul 4 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm wrong, but this is kind of loss that can send a team in to a spiral"

tampabayrays,3c12dk,millionaremattdavis,3,Sat Jul 4 06:14:35 2015 UTC,Wow. This team is fucking gut reching relentless.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,C0LL0C0,-8,Sat Jul 4 03:39:07 2015 UTC,That game has 100% convinced me that the MLB is fixed.

tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,4,Sat Jul 4 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"Dejesus has brought out the ice cream, this is not a drill"
tampabayrays,3c12dk,dullchristmas,3,Sat Jul 4 03:12:08 2015 UTC,"Is Warren still a Starter, or was he moved to the pen? And if he is a starter, Why is he out?"
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 4 03:09:56 2015 UTC,I thought he still was a starter. It's not unusual for starters to pitch extra inning games when bullpen has been used up. But I'm not familiar enough with Yankees lineup to know if he's still a starter or what
tampabayrays,3c12dk,kimura_snap,3,Sat Jul 4 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"I recall him starting some games last year, so I think he's capable of going out there for extended outings"
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,5,Sat Jul 4 03:13:55 2015 UTC,He's our best pitcher but the organization has too much blind loyalty to put CC in the pen
tampabayrays,3c12dk,pinata_penis_pump2,2,Sat Jul 4 03:13:47 2015 UTC,C-C-Seriously?
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 4 03:17:34 2015 UTC,Best pitcher? You don't think Pineda or Tanaka are better?
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:17:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, when Tanaka's got it, he's the ace of spades, but when he doesn't, he absolutely implodes."
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 4 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"Thats so true, when he doesn't know how to keep the ball down, he looks pretty bad out there"
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:20:40 2015 UTC,No.  Warren was better this year.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,pinata_penis_pump2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I kinda said, at least from a consistency standpoint... but being consistent is probably one of the most important attributes in a pitcher (gotta be able to figure what a start will entail)"
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:31:09 2015 UTC,Warren has a lower ERA and WHIP as well.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,pinata_penis_pump2,2,Sat Jul 4 03:34:23 2015 UTC,You think Geltz is gonna come out and pitch next inning as well?
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,2,Sat Jul 4 03:06:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I think so. He does it all.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,kimura_snap,3,Sat Jul 4 03:12:49 2015 UTC,my butt is so fucking hurt right now
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Zombones,2,Sat Jul 4 03:05:24 2015 UTC,Clear is half of the criteria of clear and convincing. That shits FUZZY. Dewayne is always right.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,kimura_snap,2,Sat Jul 4 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"If we can pull this shit out, we're back in first (tied on games back). After a 6 game losing streak, and a the non-existent offense, to be back in first would be huge for this team, if they can seal the deal..."
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 4 03:05:00 2015 UTC,I think the on-field crew is on our side.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,FuriousTarts,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:04:53 2015 UTC,Our strike zone had better be huge the rest of this game to make up for that crap.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Sat Jul 4 03:04:12 2015 UTC,Absolutely filthy
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,3,Sat Jul 4 03:03:45 2015 UTC,Hahah Dewayne
tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,2,Sat Jul 4 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"Yes pls, Dewayne go"
tampabayrays,3c12dk,FuriousTarts,5,Sat Jul 4 03:01:53 2015 UTC,If we are being THAT nitpicky then I want a CLEAR AND DEFINED strike zone. No more borderline calls.   And Kevin Cash needs to grow some balls. How is he just going to accept that.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,underclass4,3,Sat Jul 4 03:00:36 2015 UTC,For real...that was a time when he should've gotten tossed. This makes me miss Piniella.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,TheCenterOfEnnui,5,Sat Jul 4 03:01:40 2015 UTC,"Because it's an extra innings game, and we need a guy to manage the batting order."
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jul 4 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"With the bad streak we are in, it's time to show the players you are behind them. We may win/lose the game but a gesture like that will mean something more later in the season imo."
tampabayrays,3c12dk,underclass4,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand that, but that can be accomplished further down the road. After the offensive shitshow that was last week, and how this team looked like it was unraveling, to be in first again will also be huge."
tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 4 03:13:14 2015 UTC,god we are blowing threw our bullpen on this one

tampabayrays,3c12dk,xiedian,3,Sat Jul 4 03:00:07 2015 UTC,That was a fucking JOKE! They should of never overturned that double from Longo. That is not what replay should be used for. That's bullshit

tampabayrays,3c12dk,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Sat Jul 4 03:00:44 2015 UTC,I thought replay was instated so there would be less bullshit calls like that one.
tampabayrays,3c12dk,skelder93,2,Sat Jul 4 02:59:06 2015 UTC,That was a fucking bullshit call. If we lose this game Cash better get angry in the presser. WTF? There was no way tell if he wasn't still in contact with the bag. THis seriusly pisses me off. WHere'y my bourbobn...

tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jul 4 02:55:28 2015 UTC,it's pretty common practice to hold the tag on the runner until he calls time

tampabayrays,3c12dk,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:00:51 2015 UTC,to give the ball back to the pitcher? also the ump could probably toss you or at least give you a warning for pulling something like that.

tampabayrays,3bvaso,botts,3,Thu Jul 2 19:10:33 2015 UTC,Our bullpen has given up so many HRs this season
tampabayrays,3bvaso,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 2 19:06:30 2015 UTC,COME ON
tampabayrays,3bvaso,PinheadRecords,3,Thu Jul 2 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"K. I'm finally saying it. Bullpen is tired. Been putting it off for so long, but it is. GG guys."
tampabayrays,3bvaso,botts,6,Thu Jul 2 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"16 strikeouts, I am starting to agree with the Shelton haters."
tampabayrays,3bvaso,pokerfacetwin,2,Thu Jul 2 18:59:20 2015 UTC,We have scored 4 off one of the best pitchers in baseball to be fair
tampabayrays,3bvaso,colwell25,2,Thu Jul 2 19:05:16 2015 UTC,2 due to defensive miscues.

tampabayrays,3bvaso,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:20 2015 UTC,We're alive!
tampabayrays,3bvaso,FuriousTarts,3,Thu Jul 2 18:50:01 2015 UTC,It feels like all Longoria does now is strikeout

tampabayrays,3bvaso,FuriousTarts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i think this team's offense will be fine once Jaso and Loney come back, presumably before the all-star game."
tampabayrays,3bvaso,xiedian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"Can Jaso play 1B? He should be able to, right? That'd help a lot."
tampabayrays,3bvaso,colwell25,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"I dont think so, hes primarily a DH and i think he can play a little LF. Loney is our first baseman, so we should be fine once he's back, his glove is a tremendous upgrade from Elmore's"
tampabayrays,3bvaso,xiedian,2,Thu Jul 2 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"But any busted catcher can play first.  It's not that hard John, tell him Wash"
tampabayrays,3bvaso,colwell25,2,Thu Jul 2 18:14:27 2015 UTC,This sucks. We can't win.

tampabayrays,3bvaso,colwell25,2,Thu Jul 2 17:52:20 2015 UTC,"We just need to make it to the all star break. If we can win a couple games in the next couple of series, I will feel good about the second half. Our bullpen needs a break."

tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,5,Thu Jul 2 17:26:46 2015 UTC,Think we can get Kipnis to be our hitting coach?

tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,2,Thu Jul 2 17:32:15 2015 UTC,Kipnis PLLLSSS
tampabayrays,3bvaso,FuriousTarts,3,Thu Jul 2 17:25:05 2015 UTC,You would think we would just walk Kipnis every time he's up from now on.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:24:58 2015 UTC,Butler should never be allowed to play on the field.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,lolyou22,2,Thu Jul 2 17:24:50 2015 UTC,"Hey there Rays fans, how's Matt Moore looking?"
tampabayrays,3bvaso,TheJerzeyDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Good, had a little loss of command in the fourth but considering his long leave of absence, solid."
tampabayrays,3bvaso,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:18:16 2015 UTC,Does cabrera have to throw a bitch fit every time he strikes out?
tampabayrays,3bvaso,newtothelyte,2,Thu Jul 2 17:13:57 2015 UTC,We are fucked now.  Kluber is dealing and locked in.  Good thing we don't have to deal with no hit notifications today.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:12:21 2015 UTC,Not fucked. We're winning and A-bullpen is well-rested. As long as Moore can give us another inning or two we'll be alright.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,kingfishcoons,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:15:59 2015 UTC,They are only going to let him go 75 pitches.  At this rate he won't get past the 6th.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:19:59 2015 UTC,Casali would never be able to catch Moore

tampabayrays,3bvaso,botts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:00:37 2015 UTC,We need 3 K's now.  Dammit.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:59:53 2015 UTC,Now 2.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:00:30 2015 UTC,Fuck that shit. Take charge KK... or even Butler. That's the outfield's ball.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,botts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:56:22 2015 UTC,Ooooh man! I wanted a no-hitter
tampabayrays,3bvaso,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:55:54 2015 UTC,Haha no way Moore is throwing 9 today though

tampabayrays,3bvaso,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"Kluber is locked in , we're not getting anything off him now. Hold the fort Matt."
tampabayrays,3bvaso,lolyou22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:53:05 2015 UTC,Do you guys think Moore's velocity will return to the 94-95 mph that it was? Or is the 91-92 mph he has been at today his norm now?
tampabayrays,3bvaso,Russki75,2,Thu Jul 2 16:41:57 2015 UTC,He just went 93 and it looked effortless.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,talkintiki,2,Thu Jul 2 16:43:57 2015 UTC,It'll probably return I think
tampabayrays,3bvaso,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:43:33 2015 UTC,Can't wait till we ditch Elmore.
tampabayrays,3bvaso,lolyou22,2,Thu Jul 2 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"He had a decent start when he started playing regularly, but every game its more and more obvious he's not an everyday player. I miss loney"
tampabayrays,3bvaso,xiedian,2,Thu Jul 2 16:41:33 2015 UTC,No business starting against a righty
tampabayrays,3bvaso,lolyou22,3,Thu Jul 2 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I always thought Kluber was overrated. Got a lucky season last year but he's nowhere near an ace, at least in my mind. Let's get him!!!"

tampabayrays,3bvaso,lolyou22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:31:56 2015 UTC,I like to see someone else making defensive mistakes besides us.

tampabayrays,3bvaso,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 2 16:25:25 2015 UTC,As per the Cleveland broadcast the Rays are a major league best 30-6 in games where they score 1st

tampabayrays,3bsiyc,botts,2,Thu Jul 2 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"see if that guy had a heart, he woulda thrown it to 1st so we dont have to be no hit like this"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:46:25 2015 UTC,Its ending on a DP
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Thu Jul 2 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, guy's losing command... Brutal."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,botts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:44:58 2015 UTC,Can't take him out with the no-no going  EDIT: It it was a three run game it would be interesting
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,6,Thu Jul 2 01:46:24 2015 UTC,"alright cabby, what ur gonna want to do is hit an 9-run homer for us  edit: good enough son, good enough"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 01:44:00 2015 UTC,id probably cheer for him now if i was at the game at this point  lucky kid
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:39:45 2015 UTC,Quickly! Chopper in Dykbomb Allen!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"hey guys remember that one time when we lost 6 straight earlier in the season? yea we proceeded to do fuckin work the next 20 games, just sayin"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:39:03 2015 UTC,Ofcourse im not giving up on the season but these last few games have been brutal to the bone.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:43:32 2015 UTC,yea i just didnt want everyone gloomy in the short term
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:47:59 2015 UTC,"oooo, i wonder if longo wanted to be taken out of this pitiful game, probably not, but bad time to be taken out"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 01:37:54 2015 UTC,Just checking in guys. What's the summary of the game so far?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,xiedian,3,Thu Jul 2 01:33:24 2015 UTC,See Box Score above
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Thu Jul 2 01:35:30 2015 UTC,I envy you. Im about ready to gauge out my eyes
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,8,Thu Jul 2 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"If we get no hit here, I'm done for a while. 3 almost no hitters in a row is RIDICULOUS...."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,botts,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"Only one player can get us out of this predicament... QUICK! Light the Dyk-signal, we need a #DYKBOMB!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 01:29:27 2015 UTC,Time to fire Derek Shelton
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,psaepf2009,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"TO THE TOP WITH YOU! Been saying this since '10, below league average EVERY YEAR and no changes."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,botts,3,Thu Jul 2 01:38:04 2015 UTC,Why do we get no hit like everyday?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Kjcool2,3,Thu Jul 2 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"I think we have a special going on, no-hit through 6 and free baserunners"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:51 2015 UTC,wow that lack of cheer in those 2 outs might be the most disheartening thing to ever as a baseball player.  something so simple as to an out is met by the least amount of interest by the fans
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:26:30 2015 UTC,More cheers for the Indians than there are for the Rays... Fuckin' A.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,PinheadRecords,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:33:18 2015 UTC,Salt in the wound
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Thu Jul 2 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"god i love our announcers, pretty damn funny  ""are we really talking about this?"""
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:24:38 2015 UTC,I feel like I've never seen a team become so instantly futile as these Rays have over the past week.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,BentRods,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:23:54 2015 UTC,"I am going to challenge halflac for the master of sports sarcasm by telling you for sure and without any doubt: the Rays are just sandbagging before the all-star break.  Whoa is me injuries, we can't hit, we fall down if the crowd chants, etc.  All a ploy by Cash to lure the rest of the AL into a falso sense of security and crush them after the break!!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Thu Jul 2 01:30:30 2015 UTC,"fukn reefer man, total rally killer  i could tell we were gonna score 6 in the next two innings, but thanks to reefer, we arent gonna win now"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"halflac: master of sports sarcasm, congrats"

tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"Reifenhousen, haha 2 more earned runs  Not that it matters much  EDIT: My Bad, I meant 3"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:17:30 2015 UTC,Make it three.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Thu Jul 2 01:20:13 2015 UTC,This is embarrasing.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,mkultra3,6,Thu Jul 2 01:10:34 2015 UTC,I remember a time long ago when the Rays had a thing called baserunners
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,BentRods,5,Thu Jul 2 01:16:31 2015 UTC,"OK, PLEASE NOBODY CALL IT A COMEBACK  cuz we been here for years"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,4,Thu Jul 2 01:09:46 2015 UTC,Well well well how about a DP here?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Thu Jul 2 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"Heh, called it!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 01:11:09 2015 UTC,do u feel proud? knowing that u caused us that?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:10:54 2015 UTC,Why yes I do!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Thu Jul 2 01:12:55 2015 UTC,"We should be compensated for sitting through this, it truly pains the heart and puts you in such a danky-ass mood."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 01:00:40 2015 UTC,"whenever we lose (literally every game we've lost), i just pretend to myself that baseball isnt life and that i have other interests in my life  but we all know that isnt true"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 01:07:50 2015 UTC,I'm almost glad tomorrow's game isn't going to be on Sun.   And I'm almost equally as glad I have classroom observations scheduled for tomorrow to keep me from going to the trop.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:58:40 2015 UTC,The only reason I'm angry it's not on Sun is cause Matty Mo making his debut. Meh.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,botts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:39:01 2015 UTC,This is true but I just don't know how much longer I can take this lack of offense.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:03:59 2015 UTC,Meet you there!?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"No, no. I said I can't go."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:03:03 2015 UTC,Rough few games...

tampabayrays,3bsiyc,PinheadRecords,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:54:55 2015 UTC,"Great, now we're gonna have to see another no hitter alert on /r/baseball"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Scory22,4,Thu Jul 2 00:54:33 2015 UTC,The fuck is this shit
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:54:23 2015 UTC,"Mr. Krapul, focus on your mosquito, it will calm you down. :-)"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:05:55 2015 UTC,Still cant find him and its driving me nuts!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Thu Jul 2 01:11:40 2015 UTC,SO CLOSE
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,4,Thu Jul 2 00:54:11 2015 UTC,2 MORE OUTS!!! LETS MAKE IT 3 STRAIGHT GAMES FOR A THREAD!!!!! LETS GO RAYS!!!! U CAN DO IT!!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 00:51:53 2015 UTC,"90 pitches through 6 for colome while giving up 7 hits, 1 BB, and 5ER?  thats the ideal pitch/inning rate that any pitcher wants"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 00:49:09 2015 UTC,"Not ideal by any means, but if we can't put a man on base?"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,4,Thu Jul 2 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"wait yea, a 15 pitches per inning is what pitchers want, obviously any less is better, but 15 is still pretty dang good"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"agreed, missed your point on first read"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,3,Thu Jul 2 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the voice of reason, but ...... well fuck really? No hits through 6 again!?"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"well, its been only 5 innings for our hitters, 1 more for a thread in /r/baseball"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 00:50:26 2015 UTC,Honestly at this point I don't care if an Indians pitcher throws a perfect game or a no hitter. Anything to possibly push them through this pathetic hitting slump.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Scory22,5,Thu Jul 2 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"This is really getting infuriating, nauseating, disgusting, enraging, hilarious... Whatever you want, Ive said in the offseason we need some good hitters, for christ's sake! And then Dewayne and BA acting like its all because of the pitchers!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"Level off Mr. Krapul, think about the DL, injuries to pithcing, Loney out, etc.  Rays are still in it.  Remember last year when they went on a 12 game losing streak? And the season was over?   Not there yet by any means, even as bad as it has looked the last week."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,4,Thu Jul 2 01:02:38 2015 UTC,how many innings does a pitcher have to no-hit/perfect game for there to be a thread in r/baseball?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,4,Thu Jul 2 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"6, would be really shameful if we trigger this bot for the 3rd time in a week, this isent just the opposing pitcher!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 00:28:28 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is this getting old for everyone
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,3,Thu Jul 2 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"Is you getting old for you? Yes, you is  Edit: ahh why did u edit it, it was much better before"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 00:32:08 2015 UTC,I is thanks for getting reply for old one
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,3,Thu Jul 2 00:38:31 2015 UTC,Perfect through 4 what else is new? 😅
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 00:25:32 2015 UTC,Cash looks like he's so angry he is going to start laughing from insanity any second.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,juicemagic,2,Thu Jul 2 00:25:27 2015 UTC,Can't really blame him at this point.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Scory22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"He is the manager, who should he be mad at?"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:07:36 2015 UTC,Nobody in particular since everybody's struggling. Just angry and disappointed.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Scory22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:15:57 2015 UTC,Didn't even look like he's got gum today... Don't blame him at all.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,juicemagic,4,Thu Jul 2 00:55:02 2015 UTC,yeezus christ our hitters look awful
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"ok, at worst we are gonna be a game back if we lose, but that is if the orioles win, but theyare losing right now"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,2,Thu Jul 2 00:19:00 2015 UTC,ugh
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,3,Thu Jul 2 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"2:15 AM, No sign of the mosquito yet...beginning to believe that the mosquito is somehow magically connected to the Rays' woes. I'm convinced that when I track down and kill the mosquito, the hits will come. Grant me strength raysbros."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"Godspeed, son."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm a Tribune Reader... sorry Times."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jul 2 00:08:34 2015 UTC,Makes sense
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Thu Jul 2 00:25:25 2015 UTC,"Dewayne and BA calling the pitching from the Indians 'dominant', might be, but I think its also because our hitting! Again no hits and were in the fourth inning already."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:07:53 2015 UTC,I'm going to that Astro's game... I think I can pass for 14...
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jul 2 00:04:44 2015 UTC,I'm stick with the Cleveland broadcast.   They're advertising a Carlos Santana bobblehead.  Now I really want to drive the two hours to Cleveland for that. /s
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,juicemagic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've got a two hour drive to make too."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:17:11 2015 UTC,Lets go. I'll wear my Clippers gear to blend in.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,juicemagic,3,Thu Jul 2 00:28:03 2015 UTC,"aw, we love you Souza"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,FuriousTarts,4,Wed Jul 1 23:57:30 2015 UTC,I hate baseball.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,FuriousTarts,5,Wed Jul 1 23:52:28 2015 UTC,"Well this series has been so bad for us, we play like crap!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Wed Jul 1 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"Okay its 1:30 am, there's an elusive mosquito in my room where its boiling ass hot (35C, heatwave), i cant find the fucker but he needs to die, the rays are already down, and i have to work tomorrow. At least give me some hits Rays!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Wed Jul 1 23:44:48 2015 UTC,This team is scaring me right now honestly
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,xiedian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:43:37 2015 UTC,"So we take out Seizmore... why? DeJesus is one who needs to sit on the bench for a little bit. His Batting average has dropped from .310 to all the way to .270,"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Wed Jul 1 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"Guys, Im going to go out on a limb and say, we wont be able to score more than 1 run this game. Its a blueprint of our recent games. Give up runs early, get no hit until the 7th. Oh joy!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:33:15 2015 UTC,"Hits, maybe, hits with RISP unlikely"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"Damnit, Balfour!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Wed Jul 1 23:28:59 2015 UTC,Hmmmmmmmmm dont go full Colome please!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"Mr. Krapul sir, I know you know the game and this team, buit don't you think you might divert your criticism to the offense?  Colome might pitch a 1 hit 1 run game like Ramirez last night, buit with no hits and no runs it does not matter much."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah ofcourse our offense has been torrid, and I admit Ive seen more bad starts from Colome than good starts. But this start by Colome isent going well. In this streak our offense is surely to blame, but this game, its been our pitching, 4 runs in 3 innings isent going to cut it! Altough this offense is so infuriating, we really need some hitters!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Thu Jul 2 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"If it's Cleveland Colome, I wouldn't mind it... just don't be Washington Colome."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Wed Jul 1 23:29:41 2015 UTC,He went full Washington Colome
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"I know, Fuck him."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Wed Jul 1 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"Well thats harsh. Im not liking what Im seeing but as a fan,  you never drop your players."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,3,Wed Jul 1 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"I don't mean I hate him, I just think he just fucked us, so he needs to be fucked for his insolence in this particular situation... but Colome has potential I like, and I am a bit of a fan, honestly."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Wed Jul 1 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thinks Andriese should be pitching this one, and Colome should be in AAA?"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,xiedian,2,Wed Jul 1 23:26:44 2015 UTC,"If we can't  manage get more than 1-3 base hits, what difference does the pitcher matter?"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Wed Jul 1 23:36:32 2015 UTC,No.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Wed Jul 1 23:32:03 2015 UTC,"Colome doesn't have any options left, so they cant send him to AAA without losing him. I do think Colome would be better suited for the pen."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,mkultra3,3,Wed Jul 1 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"His control (or lack there of) scares me... his first start after fixing his ""mechanical flaw"" was dominant for lack of a better word, but it only had short term results."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Wed Jul 1 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Dropping by because the Indians GDT is empty. Hoping for a good game tonight! :) Please take care of Grady and Asdrubal, I miss them."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,wundy,4,Wed Jul 1 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"There's gonna be a lot of cussing and derogatory words towards your team, I'm gonna have to give a huge apology on my end in advance..."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Wed Jul 1 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"It's quite alright. I'm used to abuse from Detroit and Seattle (weirdly enough), so it doesn't bother me. :)"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,wundy,4,Wed Jul 1 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"On behalf of this sub I apologize for Rays8Jenningsfan to Cleveland fans, and Rays fans, and baseball fans and the rest of fucking humanity"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,4,Wed Jul 1 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Asdrubal is heating up and has been playing great defense. Not sure what Grady has left in the tank but he played well as of late, lots of nice hard hit balls. All the best for the rest of the series! Tomorrows game will be intersting, with Moore returning to face the reigning Cy!"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,mkultra3,4,Wed Jul 1 23:16:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, tomorrow should be good... Kluber is kind of iffy, though. Some days he gets rocked, some days he strikes out 18. He gets really poor run support, so we'll see.   It's been great watching Asdrubal and Grady play, except when they ruin perfect games. ;)"
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,wundy,5,Wed Jul 1 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"Colome is pitching for his spot in the rotation. With Moore and Odorizzi coming back, it's either Colome or Ramirez that will remain in the rotation.  However, I do think Colome could be very, very good in the pen."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,mkultra3,3,Wed Jul 1 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, a lot better than Bellesario for sure."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Wed Jul 1 23:58:54 2015 UTC,Are u streaming tomorrow's game?
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,haflac,5,Wed Jul 1 22:23:10 2015 UTC,Gonna try to AT WORST I will put on andy and dave audio
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,2015RaysTime,5,Wed Jul 1 23:11:01 2015 UTC,Yes tomorrow's game is at 18:35 here! I can watch Moore's return during the day. Love it!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,5,Wed Jul 1 23:18:47 2015 UTC,"No TV tomorrow! Maybe I'll go, last time I went they hit the ball with the bat, for actual baserunners and runs."
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,pokerfacetwin,2,Wed Jul 1 22:22:26 2015 UTC,Well go! I want runs! And man i want to go to a Rays game so badly! Stupid distance between Tampa and Brussels!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,2,Wed Jul 1 23:39:44 2015 UTC,Well it won't be on SunSports
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,2015RaysTime,2,Wed Jul 1 23:41:26 2015 UTC,What that sucks! Hopefully I can find another stream.
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,Krapul,6,Wed Jul 1 22:22:58 2015 UTC,Woohoo Joey Butts back in the lineup!
tampabayrays,3bsiyc,mkultra3,2,Wed Jul 1 22:27:24 2015 UTC,More than 3 hits please...

tampabayrays,3bbi7t,Krapul,2,Sat Jun 27 21:20:04 2015 UTC,62 through 5.
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 27 21:24:25 2015 UTC,Nice! CGSO!
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,Krapul,2,Sat Jun 27 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"He's looking good for it so far. The toughest innings are always 6-7, though."
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 27 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"Hell yea, Gallardo shut down Toronto"
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 27 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"Damn, Miley is cruising."
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 27 21:06:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Ortiz, this ain't Fenway! Thats staying in the park."
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 27 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"Love Saturday baseball! Now, can we hit Miley? This guy always seems to dominate us. That game where he beat Archer was hurtful."
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,5,Sat Jun 27 20:59:16 2015 UTC,Andriese showing no mercy
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,PinheadRecords,2,Sat Jun 27 20:42:57 2015 UTC,He's been damn near flawless.  Good to see
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 27 20:43:43 2015 UTC,Cabrerra has been swinging a great bat lately. Put that with his stellar defense and I really don't think he's as bad as some people think
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,CooperEarly,3,Sat Jun 27 20:31:30 2015 UTC,I'm loving Droobs at short. He's just gotta stay healthy and he's a 2-3 win player.
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 27 21:00:14 2015 UTC,For sure I really think that he can get that average up to around .250 if he keeps hitting like this.
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,CooperEarly,3,Sat Jun 27 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's mostly a case of his horrible start to the season offensively leaving a bad taste in our mouths, but he's been nothing but solid the last week or so on both ends"
tampabayrays,3bbi7t,xiedian,6,Sat Jun 27 20:35:10 2015 UTC,Cant watch the game but ill follow on at bat !

tampabayrays,3bbi7t,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 27 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense to me. His BB% is pretty eliete for him being so young, top 25 in the league in BB%"
tampabayrays,3bcmft,abbynormal1,10,Sat Jun 27 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.. We just traded for a first baseman we got from the Angels, and with Loney coming back sometime before the all-star break, this move wouldn't make a lot of sense for us."
tampabayrays,3bcmft,xiedian,6,Sun Jun 28 00:18:29 2015 UTC,We would pass. Mcgee is a top closer who hits between 98-93 fastball to change. He is too valuable to trade for 1 player like that. The rays would look at prospects but I honestly don't see them moving McGee.
tampabayrays,3bcmft,underclass4,5,Sun Jun 28 17:19:35 2015 UTC,lol
tampabayrays,3bcmft,colwell25,2,Sun Jun 28 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"So you wish to sell high on an oft injured first baseman who is riding a hot streak for one of the more dominant lefty relievers in the game? Sorry, I think we'll pass. Besides, like the other dude said, Loney is our first baseman and is coming back soon, we just traded for another guy (Krauss) and Joey Butler has been one of our better hitters and he's a 1B as well."
tampabayrays,3bcmft,NosyargKcid,-4,Sun Jun 28 05:57:36 2015 UTC,Haha you went and read my post in the rangers sub and are calling me out on it as if we are the actual GMs and our opinions have any impact on reality. Nice!
tampabayrays,3bcmft,NosyargKcid,5,Sun Jun 28 08:08:58 2015 UTC,Sorry if it came off it came off rudely. More likely Moreland could fetch Jepsen or Gomes but I don't think Cash would want to tinker with the bullpen much considering the number of injuries we're enduring this season. Cash has been using relievers very effectively so far this season.
tampabayrays,3bcmft,bpc34,0,Sun Jun 28 20:01:29 2015 UTC,i would take profar for mcgee straight up...not moreland.
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,ActNaturally,8,Thu Jun 25 22:47:35 2015 UTC,"These rookies have been really impressive. Joey Butts is showing no sign of cooling off; even though his peripherals scream ""regression candidate"", he's hitting hard-liner after hard-liner. Souza has been very good right now, but the thing I love about him is that he's been (reported to be) a very hard worker, putting a lot of time into improving his game defensively and at the plate; his SO% has been decreasing as the season has progressing.  I have to say, I think the thing that goes unnoticed when looking at the Rays from an outside perspective is that the FO has put a team of very high-character guys that really hold themselves accountable for their actions. I dont think it's any fluke that teams constrcuted this way (Giants are a great example of this now as well, given some stories about Barry Zito and Casey McGee helping younger players even though they're giving up their jobs to younger, better guys) do well.   This is very apparent in our pitching staff, who have this friendly competition with everyone. No one wants to be the loose link on a team, so they all push themselves harder and harder to get the most done. Nerdy analogy time, but it really remides me of a cohesive study group: evereyone shares all their knowledge, and no one wants to be the weakest link so they all strive for greatness; thus, they all do very, very well. I love this culture, and we have to thank James Shields and David Price for creating it. But yeah, guys like Cobb and Archer and Moore are obsessive about being the best, and their work ethic is relentless. There is something really underrated in having young, high-character guys to formulate your team to get the best out of each other. It's the same way in any professional setting, so why not baseball?  I think it's the best way to get talent (or surplus talent) from otherwise fringy guys.   I know it goes underappreciated (or even completely disregarded) due to how hard it is to quantify and slap a stat on it, but I really believe it's true.  Edit: I know reading this again sounds like wild outside speculation, but I'm basing this on a ton of written interviews and audio interviews, moslty of Topkin. Yeah, I'm an obsessive Rays reader, but I'd like to think of myself as a skeptic of sorts as well looking to find facts and draw observations from those facts."
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,mkultra3,2,Fri Jun 26 11:41:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, as a history student skepticism is the key to understanding!"
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,Krapul,3,Fri Jun 26 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"Ofcourse, this team is just getting it done without the starting rotation even resembling what it could be, could you imagine in what shape we would be if our rotation was Cobb/Archer/Smyly/Odorizzi/Moore all season long? I'm also really impressed by Karns, and I knew Lumberjack had it in him to be hitting this good. On the downside, Longoria's slide last year wasn't a one year-thing it seems, don't get me wrong he is still a good hitter, but not what he used to be."
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,Krapul,2,Thu Jun 25 22:56:57 2015 UTC,Longo has had moments this year. Just inconsistency really is the issue. Still would take Longo over any other 3B in baseball.
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,Krapul,3,Thu Jun 25 23:09:00 2015 UTC,You can give me Nolan Arenado instead tbh haha
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,kingfishcoons,2,Thu Jun 25 23:21:58 2015 UTC,"Right, you have to be excited for what the future holds if this is what we're able to accomplish when severely short-handed.   That said, maybe we just thrive as the expectation-defying underdogs? We saw what happened last year when we entered the season as WS favorites...  That should stoke the flames of the Jaso Truthers."
tampabayrays,3b4mh4,one80oneday,2,Fri Jun 26 09:27:15 2015 UTC,We have Durham to thank!

tampabayrays,3b4lkc,kingfishcoons,2,Fri Jun 26 03:58:13 2015 UTC,A Butler (.352 vLHP) / Loney (.289 vRHP) platoon at 1B would be great.

tampabayrays,3ay5fx,RaysBot,-9,Wed Jun 24 13:10:16 2015 UTC,"We have to take to the Jays the next time we play them. We have to.  I'm tired of hearing from Jays fans how we're a ""loser ball club"" that ""has no talent"" and ""should be at the bottom of the division."" And how they think Pitching doesn't matter, and how Offense is everything in baseball... I'm tired of that.  They can hit the ball, so what? Who cares? Offense (and Sex) sell tickets. Pitching wins games. Hopefully the schedule falls right into place so Archer, Odorizzi and Moore all pitch and shut them down."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Wed Jun 24 20:24:39 2015 UTC,I can honestly say out of all the teams in the East Jays fans do not say you're a 'loser ball club' that 'has no talent'. I've never heard that. And I frequent a lot of Jays sites. In fact I'd say you are the most 'feared' team in the East by Jays fans because historically we always play badly against you.

tampabayrays,3ay5fx,colwell25,2,Wed Jun 24 18:35:31 2015 UTC,This is such a tense inning. Boxey has been shakey these past few weeks...
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,2,Wed Jun 24 18:29:39 2015 UTC,He hasn't really done much wrong to get runners on the corners and 1 out
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,colwell25,2,Wed Jun 24 18:30:38 2015 UTC,Just the command. I fear for a ball in the dirt getting past Casali.

tampabayrays,3ay5fx,FuriousTarts,2,Wed Jun 24 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Credit to Casali too for nabbing some of those pitches that ended up way out there.

tampabayrays,3ay5fx,kingfishcoons,2,Wed Jun 24 17:42:40 2015 UTC,Very well done Nate! Let's go get some runs
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,colwell25,2,Wed Jun 24 17:32:50 2015 UTC,I think the most disappointing thing about this offseason was that we cleaned house yet Derek Shelton survived.  I know this game would be going this way regardless but we've had bad offense for like 6-7 years now and he's been at the helm the whole time.  I really don't know why we don't try something new...
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,FuriousTarts,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"Sigh, I really hate these Derek Shelton comments. If he's responsible for the lack of offense (which he's not), he should also be responsible for guys like Joey Butts and Elmore who weren't expected to hit, and have hit.  It's not his fault."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"There's always this response.  Always.  That's why I even debated typing it.  I can't help my feelings, I think we would be better with someone new.    If anything, guys come to the team hitting and then when they're on the team awhile they regress.  I really don't think he's done a good job and it's a very hard thing to prove.  But I really don't see the problem with trying someone new."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,FuriousTarts,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's a very fair response. I just think that the FO are the ones targeting meh hitters mostly because good hitters are very expensive on the open market. The Rays farm haven't been too great at developing hitters themselves when compared to the pitchings staff.   The Rays solution of having new blood with the hitting coach is to also hire an assistant, Jamie Nelson. I think that's a good median than firing someone for something he is not directly responsible for."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"Well if this 6-7 years isn't what a bad hitting coach looks like, then I'd fear what an actual bad hitting coach would look like."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,FuriousTarts,2,Wed Jun 24 17:59:40 2015 UTC,BOOOOOOOOOO

tampabayrays,3ay5fx,Kjcool2,2,Wed Jun 24 17:13:20 2015 UTC,Sounds goood...on my radio broadcast. Wish I could watch the game.
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,5,Wed Jun 24 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"Sooo, double no-hitter going with no SunSports broadcast..... Great....."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,2,Wed Jun 24 17:13:54 2015 UTC,The Blue Jays announcer has an awful voice. Wish MLB TV offered their picture with WDAE commentary
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,colwell25,5,Wed Jun 24 17:09:01 2015 UTC,This is great fun
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,colwell25,5,Wed Jun 24 17:13:05 2015 UTC,This game is going by quick.  Their defense is really sharp behind a pitcher who looks dominating.  Hold me.
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,FuriousTarts,2,Wed Jun 24 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"Souza not in the lineup? Weird... he has average up to .230, not great but better than it was."
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Wed Jun 24 17:03:03 2015 UTC,Probably just a day off. Would expect him back in there on Friday.
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,3,Wed Jun 24 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Way to go SunSports. How about we contract the 12 games a year you don't broadcast to CW44 or Great38 or something?
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,2015RaysTime,2,Wed Jun 24 16:56:26 2015 UTC,The new TV deal is going to be done in a few seasons. I think they should be able to get the whole slate (and a lot of other money due to great ratings = better payroll).
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,mkultra3,2,Wed Jun 24 16:39:03 2015 UTC,The contract is coming up in a few years. Might not be a bad suggestion to give the team.
tampabayrays,3ay5fx,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:43:05 2015 UTC,Great38 does a fantastic job with Tampa Bay Rowdies broadcasts. Now that WFLA-8 owns the station Media General could pump a lot of money into picking up the contract! Which would be fantastic because cable cutters can use rabbit ears to watch games.
tampabayrays,3awftz,Buddy813,5,Wed Jun 24 01:27:04 2015 UTC,"He's definitely in the conversation. The league has taken a notice of him for sure, and I would classify him as an elite pitcher already. If he keeps his consistent play up, no doubt he can give any other pitcher a run for their money"
tampabayrays,3awftz,xiedian,5,Wed Jun 24 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"Think so as well, but Sale and Gray are closely behind Archer, so any slipup Archer has will definilty hurt him if it's for a prolonged period of time. On that list, even though Keuchel is #1, I'd put him behind those three, though I think he's there because of the IP.  The good things is that Archer seems to have learned the ability to regain compsure on the mound and make in-game adjustments, which is a huge step up from last year."
tampabayrays,3awftz,mkultra3,6,Wed Jun 24 12:16:31 2015 UTC,"Def in the mix, and strongly...  http://espn.go.com/mlb/features/cyyoung"
tampabayrays,3awftz,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Wed Jun 24 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. He is destroying in stats, but he's second to Dallas Keuchel? Doesn't make any sense."
tampabayrays,3awftz,Kujataa,3,Wed Jun 24 02:01:33 2015 UTC,Maybe because he made one more start than Keuchel?  Surprised to see Boxberger on that list.
tampabayrays,3awftz,lolyou22,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:41:26 2015 UTC,Probably 2nd to Sale right now.
tampabayrays,3awftz,Ian_is_funny,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely a strong candidate. He's up there with Felix and Sale (and there's another pitcher who I'm forgetting). The big thing will be how many wins he gets. With run support like he's been getting, I think he can break 20 wins, which is what he needs to do to be considered for the award. Era and K's will fall into place."
tampabayrays,3awftz,davehasopinions,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:29:20 2015 UTC,"Right now I think he's 3rd, Sonny Gray and Chris Sale are in a dead heat for #1. He's in the conversation though."
tampabayrays,3avdxy,Deofol7,5,Tue Jun 23 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"Must do- Ferg's beforehand. Gotta see the Rays tank. Maybe the Ted Williams museum.  Eat-There is a place right off the rotunda that's food, and a porch in center field that's good to hang out in.  Parking-the best parking is at the stadium but it's the most expensive. There are cheaper and even free options close by, but you have to dig for them. It's a safe area so no worries there.  No idea on gluten free..."

tampabayrays,3avdxy,fosh1zzle,2,Wed Jun 24 14:13:05 2015 UTC,Nor I.  Which is why they should have went back home to begin with.  FUN FACT!  Due to the fact that the Jets play in a Jr. High Skating Rink the Thrashers still has better attendance.

tampabayrays,3asjxp,arr-tard,6,Tue Jun 23 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"They had no issues. They averaged 19,403 fans per game when they played there in 93' - 96'."
tampabayrays,3asjxp,Ryan05055,3,Tue Jun 23 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"I was a kid when I went to Lightning games there but to my best recollection it was always a packed house.  Hell, it even felt like a packed house for Storm games.  Jay Gruden baby!"
tampabayrays,3asjxp,Landlubber77,3,Tue Jun 23 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"No, but it's an apples to oranges comparison. The Lightning were new in that building at the time (and pretty new in general), played half the number of games, and the Rays weren't in the area at all yet (so less competition).  Everyone knows the solution to our attendance problems but we're all held hostage by, literally, 4 people on the St Pete city council."
tampabayrays,3asjxp,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Tue Jun 23 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"For the (Devil) Rays first 3 seasons they averaged 30k, 21k and 18k. They didn't have any ""issues"" their first 3 seasons either, despite playing some terrible baseball. The Lightning also had minimal direct competition, with only some minor overlap with the NFL season. But keep in mind, this was toward the end of the creamsicle Bucs, a time when literally no one wanted to be a Bucs fan.   Edit: spelling"
tampabayrays,3asjxp,GoljansBiceps,5,Tue Jun 23 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"Also, the Rays play twice as many games.  To be honest, I am thinking about going to one of the Jays games this week, maybe tonight. However, I live in Wesley Chapel. That means I would need to leave here around 4:30 and I wouldn't make it back home until 11:30 (maybe). That's a 7 hour commitment. For a midweek game, that's a lot.   BUILD IT IN DOWNTOWN TAMPA. Please oh please let the St Pete council elections turn out well...."
tampabayrays,3asjxp,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Tue Jun 23 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think this figure from the ABC coalition that looked at different sites had the most telling figure regarding attendance at the Trop. It was made using data from the 2000 census, but it's very telling.   http://imgur.com/HOHkZoW"
tampabayrays,3asjxp,GoljansBiceps,2,Tue Jun 23 14:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen that before and it says a LOT. That right there is the reason we get 10000 last night. Downtown St Pete is just not close to a lot of people.  That ABC study also showed that downtown Tampa was MUCH better in these terms. The study was conducted in 2009 (has it been that long???)....  ""By 2013, 1.8 million people will live within a 30-minute drive of the area, according to the USF study. Only 1.2 million people will live that close to the Trop.""  http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/abc-coalition-identifies-5-pinellas-hillsborough-locations-for-new-rays/1032220"
tampabayrays,3asjxp,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Tue Jun 23 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, I agree that it's a fair point regarding hockey vs. baseball attendance as apples to oranges but like Biceps was saying, the figures at least looked stronger for the first two seasons of the (Devil) Rays' existence.  Was it just that the novelty of having a new team ended up wearing off by the third season and/or the Rays just kept losing popularity because of the long stretch of losing years? I feel that, if we had a team that has been as great as yours (always being a threat to contend) for the last 5-7 years, then our fans (and bandwagoneers) would probably pack the place (although I might be making another apples to oranges comparison here since our stadium is centrally located and convenient to get to by public transit and therefore, easier for multiple people to access)."
tampabayrays,3asjxp,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Tue Jun 23 21:38:19 2015 UTC,Imagine if your stadium was in Peterborough. That's where we are.
tampabayrays,3asjxp,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"Man, people in glass houses shouldn't be casting stones. Last I checked, the Jays don't pack the house every night themselves. (Not taking a shot at OP, btw.)"
tampabayrays,3asjxp,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,6,Tue Jun 23 12:57:18 2015 UTC,"We are averaging about 27,000 fans per game, Rays are averaging about 14,200 fans per game.  But our attendance isn't as important as our TV numbers. The corporation that owns our team also owns the TV channel the Jays play on, so the TV numbers have a direct effect on profits. And the Jays have the most viewers of any team (we have a whole country as a local market)."
tampabayrays,3asjxp,GoljansBiceps,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"What data are you basing most viewers on? I'm legitimately curious because I rarely see data for the Jays since Nielsen doesn't track Canadian viewing.  Rays have been consistently been in top half of MLB in regards to TV ratings, both by rating and household #. When they get a new TV contract, attendance will matter much less to them as well. But a closer to/in Tampa will enable the Rays to maximize attendance and profits."
tampabayrays,3asjxp,dragonmgmt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:11:28 2015 UTC,The comparison to hockey is apples and oranges.  Biceps and Ennul have the right of it.
tampabayrays,3asjxp,thegreatcerebral,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:46:41 2015 UTC,I went to tons of Lightning games there.  It was always packed but that was entirely different.  They had a huge fan zone area with all kids of stuff to do and the Lightning were only 3 years old when they moved there because they outgrew the Expo Hall.

tampabayrays,3aqyfa,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Tue Jun 23 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"Meh. I guess if your team's objective is just to make the ALDS and get steam-rolled then I guess you got me there.   Either way any team that thinks ""pitching doesn't mean anything"" won't go anywhere. No one on the Jays sub denies pitching is priority number 1. But at the end of the day you need to actually score runs to win"
tampabayrays,3aqyfa,goldsnake,5,Tue Jun 23 03:06:18 2015 UTC,We didn't have the leagues best offence in the last 3 years.

The Jays have another day off on Thursday, and Travis (who was one of the best bats on the entire team) is expected back in a few days, they didn't need to bench half the lineup today."

tampabayrays,3akhr4,MrMovieMoney,16,Sun Jun 21 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"If you had told me the Rays would be 10 games above 500 after the offseason we had, I'd have asked you to share what you were smoking.  RAYS UP!"
tampabayrays,3akhr4,Greenedragon,12,Sun Jun 21 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"What's even more impressive is that we're the second team in the American League to reach 40 wins and currently tied for most wins. We're behind the Astros by only half a game. We're the third best team in the AL, guys."
tampabayrays,3akhr4,usabfb,2,Sun Jun 21 03:48:08 2015 UTC,Second best team in the AL! Thank you Mariners.
tampabayrays,3akhr4,Rays8JenningsFan,9,Sun Jun 21 13:02:57 2015 UTC,"Simply, incredible. These boys, all they do is win win win. Who would have thought they would be where they are at this point of the season, I know I didnt."

As dmboyer said, you can't win em all, but it's safe to say even if they don't win, they're playing great baseball and there in almost every game."
tampabayrays,3alttn,C0LL0C0,7,Sun Jun 21 20:48:31 2015 UTC,Can't win em all. Just be happy with the series victory and a 4-1 road trip. Tough loss though
tampabayrays,3alttn,Dmboyer,-2,Sun Jun 21 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"Not when the Yankees also tear the Tigers a new asshole, and we gain absolutely no ground in the AL east... The one day they lose, and it's the day we decide we just don't want to be a playoff team."
tampabayrays,3alttn,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sun Jun 21 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"One loss. ONE. Quit being negative, ""not a playoff team"", sheesh...."
tampabayrays,3alttn,botts,-3,Sun Jun 21 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Today we did not play like one. I get it's just one loss, but if we can't hit in September, we'll be done in 3 games... if we can hold off the fucking Yankees."
tampabayrays,3alttn,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jun 21 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's a good thing September is THREE FUXKING MONTHS AWAY then eh? Loney, Jennings, jaso, etc all should be healthy by then. Just because we don't hit in one game doesn't mean we can't effing hit.   Oh and btw, playoffs are in October."
tampabayrays,3alttn,botts,0,Sun Jun 21 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"We can only afford to lose 39 more games, so everyone of these god forsaken one run losses add up...  And the Wild Card Game was in September last year... not used to the potential of another November World Series..."
tampabayrays,3alttn,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Mon Jun 22 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Takes literally 2 seconds to see that this year, regular season ends October 4. The term ""October baseball"" wasn't coined accidentally. Playoffs occur in October. The wildcard game (which, btw, goes against your ""3 games and done"" statement due to it being a 1 and done game) was held on the LAST DAY of September last year. Hardly counts.  Your attitude is just bad. Rays are in first place with near record breaking numbers on the DL. 1 pitcher from last year right now. 1. And in first place . leading the AL in wins. Have some damn faith. Jeeze."
tampabayrays,3alttn,botts,0,Mon Jun 22 00:44:01 2015 UTC,"What the Hells your problem? I point out any thing, or get upset with a damn loss (like I'm supposed to as a damn fan) and you whine your shit, every time. Can you just fucking let me rant for a god damn second and let out the emotion?  Jesus fucking christ. We lost a one-run game we should have won, it's not all sunshines and rainbows all the time.  And if we don't show up in September, we won't play in October anyway."

tampabayrays,3alttn,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jun 21 19:20:39 2015 UTC,I kind of feel bad about that considering just how poor Colome pitched last time out.  Would have been nice for him to get the win.

tampabayrays,3ajj06,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:29:20 2015 UTC,"So I suppose all the ""heat"" the Rays feel are from the depths of hell, huh?"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,RaysBot,0,Sat Jun 20 20:10:23 2015 UTC,Any word on Ramirez's injury?
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Intelligenttrees,5,Sun Jun 21 06:58:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome game tonight, hoping the guys sweep this series!"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,PinheadRecords,6,Sun Jun 21 02:21:01 2015 UTC,I just screamed at my tv at that last strikeout.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,millionaremattdavis,2,Sun Jun 21 02:20:41 2015 UTC,I punched the air and hit my own face
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,6,Sun Jun 21 02:24:16 2015 UTC,THANK YOU GOD https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f6/07/52/f60752b4481e83013217fa3d82f616bd.jpg
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,2015RaysTime,7,Sun Jun 21 02:19:36 2015 UTC,"Early lead, short start, great bullpen, strong defense, Box save, 4-1 win, basically 2015 in a nutshell"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,4,Sun Jun 21 02:19:19 2015 UTC,YESSSSS
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,4,Sun Jun 21 02:19:02 2015 UTC,That location & movement though. Perfection

tampabayrays,3ajgxi,anonymau5,4,Sun Jun 21 02:19:14 2015 UTC,Hahah perfect!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,xiedian,3,Sun Jun 21 02:20:18 2015 UTC,wheeeeeee
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,ophiuroid,2,Sun Jun 21 02:18:08 2015 UTC,FEEL THE HEAT-ER!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jun 21 02:17:49 2015 UTC,BALL OF STEEL
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,anonymau5,2,Sun Jun 21 02:17:35 2015 UTC,Crap
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,princelabia,2,Sun Jun 21 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or does Cleveland need to make that drum beat more....Indian?"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Sun Jun 21 02:14:20 2015 UTC,"KK is just begging you to make him dive, I'm pretty sure he'd prefer it"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,xiedian,2,Sun Jun 21 02:08:45 2015 UTC,How awesome is kiermaier?
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,ophiuroid,2,Sun Jun 21 02:07:07 2015 UTC,Kiermaier's speed to the ball saving bases again
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,3,Sun Jun 21 02:06:58 2015 UTC,I'll never forget that 5 walk game Souza had. Strange stuff right there
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,xiedian,3,Sun Jun 21 01:56:23 2015 UTC,Cmon Gommer let's not the game unravel.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,3,Sun Jun 21 01:45:30 2015 UTC,There's a slightly more subtle example of how good KK's defense is - a guy as quick as Michael Bourn really should be on third right now.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,5,Sun Jun 21 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"After that mess on the run down, this and we still can't get a run off of it."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,11,Sun Jun 21 01:30:54 2015 UTC,Kevin Kiermaier has more triples than the Angels
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,4,Sun Jun 21 01:30:39 2015 UTC,Well that worked out.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,millionaremattdavis,4,Sun Jun 21 01:30:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, talk about lucky right there"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,3,Sun Jun 21 01:29:10 2015 UTC,Oh dear hahahaha
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,2,Sun Jun 21 01:28:58 2015 UTC,What... was that?
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sun Jun 21 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"I love this kid, can't imagine him on any other team"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,xiedian,6,Sun Jun 21 01:25:41 2015 UTC,What better place to show off your Cowboy hat promotion than at the Cleveland Indians stadium...
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,NosyargKcid,6,Sun Jun 21 01:00:38 2015 UTC,"Belisario's sinker has some nice lateral movement on it, and a nice play there yet again by Cabby"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,10,Sun Jun 21 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"As a positive, Moore rehabs with Durham on Sunday"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,3,Sun Jun 21 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"Almost there! They're talking about this one and one more and then having him back with the Rays. Should be joining around the same time Loney comes back, with odorizzi coming back shortly after!!!"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:58:46 2015 UTC,Smyly back mid August you reckon?
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,2,Sun Jun 21 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"That's the one I have no idea. Reports are that he's throwing again, but he could potentially encounter setbacks (still a tear in that shoulder) and also a rehab assignment that will probably take a month. So yeah, not sure but everyone said a few weeks ago that sometime in August would be doable."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,2,Sun Jun 21 01:47:50 2015 UTC,Oh god the hype train is about to reach maximum speed here in about 2 weeks.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,CooperEarly,3,Sun Jun 21 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"Why not go to Andriese? He's technically a bullpen guy, but can go a few innings normally."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun Jun 21 00:26:55 2015 UTC,They need him as the Odorizzi starter replacement. The only reason they had him come out of the pen in Washington was because of the pinch hitting opportunity with having a short inning guy like Geltz going first.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,4,Sun Jun 21 01:01:29 2015 UTC,It's OK. We have our bullpen's 5-6-7-8-9 guys lined up.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,ophiuroid,3,Sun Jun 21 00:50:22 2015 UTC,"Did erasmo get hurt? I'm not watching, on mobile"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,haflac,3,Sun Jun 21 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"Appears to be a groin injury. Proceeding with caution, hopefully it's not serious."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,4,Sun Jun 21 00:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, he was holding his groin, don't know the extent of it yet."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,7,Sun Jun 21 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"This is NOT GOOD. We are so shallow at pitchers, particularly possible starters, this could be bad."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,YouEnjoyMyself84,6,Sun Jun 21 00:21:37 2015 UTC,Please be precautionary...
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,NosyargKcid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be... or just taking him off to not deal with the pain while pitching. It's a pull, it's gotta be a pull."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,9,Sun Jun 21 00:23:30 2015 UTC,Oh god
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,millionaremattdavis,6,Sun Jun 21 00:18:48 2015 UTC,"Groin... Too much to manage down there. :)  In all seriousness, hope he's okay."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sun Jun 21 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"NOoooo, we dont need this right now."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,2,Sun Jun 21 00:18:18 2015 UTC,Cash is crazy aggressive on the bases.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,YouEnjoyMyself84,6,Sun Jun 21 00:14:19 2015 UTC,They need to have a game where the whole thing is just a broadcast of the Rays dugout.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,FuriousTarts,5,Sun Jun 21 00:08:47 2015 UTC,Unfortunate for Longo there. Couldn't have really won
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,4,Sat Jun 20 23:55:37 2015 UTC,Load'em up!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,7,Sat Jun 20 23:52:27 2015 UTC,I'm glad to see kk stealing. He has the potential speed. When he works out the details of the jump he's going to be unstoppable.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,kimura_snap,4,Sat Jun 20 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"In most walks of life, when an Outlaw steals something, he gets sent to prison... we try to send him home in baseball!"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jun 20 23:48:44 2015 UTC,Nice steal
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,ophiuroid,8,Sat Jun 20 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"I know we gave Ramirez a lot of shit at the beginning of the year (and rightfully so), but he has really turned it around and i'm happy for him. I think he gets the boot once Moore and Rizzi come back, but it's good to know that he's good for a spot start or two"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,CooperEarly,6,Sat Jun 20 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"I would have agreed with you... until Colome's last start. It wasn't that he was blown up, it was the lack of control. Ramirez has leapfroged him into that spot, he'll probably stay."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Sat Jun 20 23:51:29 2015 UTC,Let's get DeJesus some more fielding practice.

tampabayrays,3ajgxi,vikes23,4,Sat Jun 20 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"You should love the host, not me :P I'm just the messenger."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,djabby,5,Sat Jun 20 23:57:27 2015 UTC,Well extra outs are ok for this inning only.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,FuriousTarts,3,Sat Jun 20 23:25:36 2015 UTC,I love all these 0-2 foul balls.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,ophiuroid,2,Sat Jun 20 23:24:40 2015 UTC,WHY would DeJesus run right there??????
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,YouEnjoyMyself84,3,Sat Jun 20 23:23:24 2015 UTC,The TV broadcasters were saying that Bourn arm is pretty weak sauce so they wanted to test him early to see what we were working with. I think it was still a poor decision by DeJesus but the scouting report said to try
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,CooperEarly,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"Baring a throwing error, he was never going to beat a throw from that close."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,YouEnjoyMyself84,3,Sat Jun 20 23:46:19 2015 UTC,"Should have went to 3rd on your hit, DJ, that would have been a run."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 20 23:22:45 2015 UTC,Well so much for this inning.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,millionaremattdavis,6,Sat Jun 20 23:22:42 2015 UTC,Corey Kluber is like a poor version of Erasmo Ramirez
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,colwell25,3,Sat Jun 20 23:21:43 2015 UTC,Whats the link to that one dude who streams every game?
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,vikes23,9,Sat Jun 20 23:19:55 2015 UTC,Jesus that ball was crushed. This year Longo > Last year Longo
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,CooperEarly,4,Sat Jun 20 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"Everything except the HRs, but even then he can go on a run."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly I don't think the HRs are gonna come back. I'd love to see him kinda change his approach at the plate and become more a of Joey Votto kind of player, just hit for average and get on base as much as humanly possible. He is still a very good hitter so he'll be good for about 17-20 HRs, but I'd rather see a .290 average with 15-17 HRs than a .260 average with 22-25 HRs"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,CooperEarly,2,Sat Jun 20 23:25:48 2015 UTC,"I still think he's a 20 HR guy, just had some nagging injuries, and the Trop isn't really HR friendly."
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,6,Sat Jun 20 23:35:28 2015 UTC,This is an AMAZING start.
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,millionaremattdavis,3,Sat Jun 20 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"Nice bomb, especially from a guy with a bum wrist!"
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,4,Sat Jun 20 23:17:02 2015 UTC,Nice first three batters
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,ophiuroid,3,Sat Jun 20 23:16:46 2015 UTC,Make it 4!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,4,Sat Jun 20 23:17:30 2015 UTC,LONGO!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,millionaremattdavis,6,Sat Jun 20 23:16:38 2015 UTC,That's what I LIKE TO SEE! LONGO GOES HOME! 3-0!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 20 23:16:36 2015 UTC,The Outlaw is aboard!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 20 23:12:11 2015 UTC,Scary matchup today vs Kluber. Hopefully we can keep the train rollin!
tampabayrays,3ajgxi,mkultra3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's a little vulnerable with the 8 loses this year, and he's thrown 5 balls already (in 6 pitches)"
tampabayrays,3aho6b,purdy_toasted,10,Sat Jun 20 07:16:26 2015 UTC,Yes. It was amazing.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,kris919,2,Sat Jun 20 09:06:56 2015 UTC,Were you that fan on the field near the end?
tampabayrays,3aho6b,they_call_me_dewey,2,Sat Jun 20 10:18:23 2015 UTC,Security guards were on point. Inches from losing the mission and they tackle him to the ground.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,BrazilianRider,4,Sat Jun 20 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"Sure was, i was 12 people to the right of where the ball landed."
tampabayrays,3aho6b,xBOHICAx,3,Sat Jun 20 13:26:17 2015 UTC,This was my very first Devil Rays game (sat in sec. 312) after moving to St. Pete from Atlanta. Remember thinking that this was way cooler than watching the Braves lose each year in the playoffs.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,NicoBroje,4,Sat Jun 20 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"Man, the 90s were in full force at this time"
tampabayrays,3aho6b,newtothelyte,3,Sat Jun 20 14:55:08 2015 UTC,I was there. I sat near first base but many rows up. It was such a cool moment to witness.  I still see Wade around Tampa at times. Mostly when he does a charity auction or something. He'll turn up on the mic and tell everyone to pony up some cash for the cause. The man loves his beer. Lmao.  Good guy Wade.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,LosGotsDisBish,2,Sat Jun 20 14:13:50 2015 UTC,I was one section over.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,ArmadilloPenguin,2,Sat Jun 20 15:52:58 2015 UTC,Oh man. I was on the way to this game when my car broke down. I spent it stranded on McMullen Booth Road. The home run didn't land too far from where I would have been sitting
tampabayrays,3aho6b,AnimalPragmatism,2,Sun Jun 21 06:48:16 2015 UTC,I know the guy who caught the ball haha
tampabayrays,3aho6b,cgerdes,2,Sun Jun 21 13:11:06 2015 UTC,I was at the game. I saw the Home Run and I was watching both Jeter's and A-Rod's 3000 Hit as a HR.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,iambumper,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Would be nice to have his caliber type player on the team right now, but either way these boys are getting it done"
tampabayrays,3aho6b,C0LL0C0,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:07:19 2015 UTC,"I was at the game after, which we already had tickets to I believe. Missed by one game, but we got to see all the celebratory stuff that day."
tampabayrays,3aho6b,habeas_corpse,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:18:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely.   Was 10 years old up in the nice handicapped seats in 306 with my grandpa.  Was awesome.
tampabayrays,3aho6b,IF_it_was_in_ur_ass,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"I was. We actually had a Saturday plan at the time but as it became apparent Boggs would probably hit 3,000 that weekend, we bought up tickets for pretty much the entire surrounding home stand just to cover our bases. And of course he has that monster game on the night we'd have been there anyway lol."

tampabayrays,3afu8v,JoebobZanzibar,7,Sat Jun 20 02:07:57 2015 UTC,LOL at Kiermaier's seemingly unnecessary jump that was probably completely necessary
tampabayrays,3afu8v,colwell25,5,Sat Jun 20 02:07:46 2015 UTC,Who does he think he is? Jesus?
tampabayrays,3afu8v,xiedian,8,Sat Jun 20 02:07:33 2015 UTC,The AL East has been so annoying recently.  At least the O's and Jays are playing each other so someone has to lose.
tampabayrays,3afu8v,FuriousTarts,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:06:49 2015 UTC,My morning routine:  Did the Rays win? Shitchyeah they did! checks standings God dammit.

tampabayrays,3adfxj,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Fri Jun 19 05:31:27 2015 UTC,"I would say that it's a good sign, but is no indicator that he'll be pitching later this season or is still on his regular timetable.   I'm more amped for Odorizzi and Moore who should be returning at the end of the month! We'll get a rotation of Archer-Odorizzi-Moore-Karns-Ramirez, which isn't a bad rotation. Yes, no Smyly (or Cobb), but the way Ramirez and Karns have been pitching, I would still call it the strongest rotation in the division."
tampabayrays,3adfxj,mkultra3,3,Fri Jun 19 12:39:39 2015 UTC,"He hasn't had surgery, that's what really bothers me. He's just postponing his career every day he doesn't."
tampabayrays,3adfxj,EvelandsRule,2,Fri Jun 19 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"But that's the decision he and the team have made. I personally like the decision. Whether it helps or hinders the Rays. I just think teams are too quick to say players need TJ. I think this is the right move, and I know my opinion is not of the majority."

tampabayrays,3adfxj,EvelandsRule,3,Fri Jun 19 23:04:43 2015 UTC,Pretty sure his non-surgery timetable was an August return.
tampabayrays,3adfxj,mkultra3,2,Fri Jun 19 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just saying that the team can have a respectable rotation without him.  I think Smyly back, even if he has a shoulder tear, can still do good. That is, if there are no more injuries...."
tampabayrays,3abnpi,RaysBot,7,Thu Jun 18 20:05:11 2015 UTC,To take 3 of 4 from this Washington team with 80% of the rotation on the DL is outstanding
tampabayrays,3abnpi,colwell25,10,Fri Jun 19 02:28:12 2015 UTC,Hell yea! Quietest Division leaders in the league!

tampabayrays,3abnpi,xiedian,2,Fri Jun 19 02:24:27 2015 UTC,Rendon is getting victimized by some well located pitches today. Tough ABs
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,2,Fri Jun 19 02:22:22 2015 UTC,Why Box closing instead of Jep or McGee?

tampabayrays,3abnpi,Mlacombe11909,7,Fri Jun 19 04:57:03 2015 UTC,Joey Butler has been the biggest surprise for me this year. He's like the Dan Johnson/Russ Canzler/Justin Ruggiano AAAA guy that could actually hit for awhile.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,6,Fri Jun 19 02:12:47 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Franklin made solid contact."
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,6,Fri Jun 19 02:09:21 2015 UTC,Feels good knowing that Kiermaier is patrolling center. Hits like that don't phase me.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,7,Fri Jun 19 02:06:47 2015 UTC,"fucking hell Kiermaier, you spoil us"

tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,3,Fri Jun 19 01:51:38 2015 UTC,Cut the shit Jepsen
tampabayrays,3abnpi,imperfectofcourse,6,Fri Jun 19 01:50:41 2015 UTC,Yunel Escobar probably says 'swag' without irony.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,5,Fri Jun 19 01:47:14 2015 UTC,Come on Escobar you're not allowed to play like this
tampabayrays,3abnpi,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 19 01:46:58 2015 UTC,Hell yea! Nice play Droobs!    Always scared when pitchers throw to bags.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,3,Fri Jun 19 01:46:22 2015 UTC,Beautiful

tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,5,Fri Jun 19 01:29:27 2015 UTC,"Thats what we're paying you for Cabby, nice"
tampabayrays,3abnpi,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 19 01:29:08 2015 UTC,When did Asdrubal turn into a gold glove SS? Wow.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,colwell25,6,Fri Jun 19 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"Hope Harper's okay, could just be a Hyper extension, and that's what I hope... but the way he held that knee just makes me think of Carson Palmer."

tampabayrays,3abnpi,millionaremattdavis,3,Fri Jun 19 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"Ah crap, another dealy..."
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,3,Fri Jun 19 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, thank you Yunel!"
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,4,Fri Jun 19 00:22:12 2015 UTC,This game feels like it's still winnable. Need to collect some hits!
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,5,Fri Jun 19 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"Can't watch this game, at work.    Is Archer getting squeezed? It looks that way from the pitch tracker."
tampabayrays,3abnpi,zeitfalle,4,Thu Jun 18 23:59:50 2015 UTC,He is having trouble throwing that fastball for strikes. He got squeezed a few times but also had his slider called for strikes when they weren't.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,2,Fri Jun 19 00:04:38 2015 UTC,We are not getting any strike calls this game
tampabayrays,3abnpi,CooperEarly,2,Thu Jun 18 23:59:25 2015 UTC,Such bad calls from the umpire tonight
tampabayrays,3abnpi,DylanRamsey,3,Thu Jun 18 23:59:12 2015 UTC,"God that scared me for a second, thought Elmore was hurt too."

tampabayrays,3abnpi,2015RaysTime,3,Thu Jun 18 23:39:19 2015 UTC,Thanks Cabby.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,3,Thu Jun 18 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"Close, ooff too close for comfort there."
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,3,Thu Jun 18 23:27:11 2015 UTC,Command looks a bit off. Trying to find the zone.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,3,Thu Jun 18 23:14:42 2015 UTC,Span learning to get that ball in quickly vs KK.
tampabayrays,3abnpi,mkultra3,2,Thu Jun 18 23:07:19 2015 UTC,I remember we used to do well vs Doug Fister when he was in Detroit. Hopefully we can beat that sinking fb of his.

tampabayrays,3abnpi,djabby,4,Thu Jun 18 23:04:35 2015 UTC,Archer is back where his ML career started! Let's take this series!
tampabayrays,3abh32,Dirtydirtdirtt,11,Thu Jun 18 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"Well at least one of his 3 was off Sale to win that game.  Also, I think he only has 2 errors in the field.  Something like a .990 fielding percentage.  There's got to be some value in that."
tampabayrays,3abh32,enfranci,9,Thu Jun 18 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"His offense has been bad, but he's been the 5th best fielding SS in MLB based on UZR, 2nd in the AL. It's been enough to counter his god-awful offense so far. Overall WAR has been 0.5, good for 13th in the MLB.   At the end of the season, he'll probably close to a WAR 1.5. With the league average of about $6 million per win, he'll probably still exceed the value of his contract, pretty much on defense alone."
tampabayrays,3abh32,GoljansBiceps,9,Thu Jun 18 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"He's saved quite a few runs at SS. I'm plesently surprised!  I can forgive the awful offense if he keeps up the defense at SS... Yunel cost us games last year with that defense.   I guess there's no alterative to him in the farm. Daniel Robertson would have had a good shot at starting with the Rays sometime next year (lets say July); however, he's down and out with an injury that might hinder his development. Hak Ju Lee has been even worse in AAA, but it might be worth giving him a shot."
tampabayrays,3abh32,mkultra3,3,Thu Jun 18 21:52:57 2015 UTC,I definitely want criticizing his defense but his hitting makes my penis sad.
tampabayrays,3abh32,GoljansBiceps,7,Thu Jun 18 22:25:43 2015 UTC,I think his lack of offense has made all our penises a little sad.
tampabayrays,3abh32,YouEnjoyMyself84,6,Fri Jun 19 00:03:18 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Penis = Sad
tampabayrays,3abh32,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Fri Jun 19 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"Didn't he get a lot better late in the season after going to Cleveland? Hopefully he can pick it up here soon, or one of these Outfielders can conjure up their inner Zoborist and play Shortstop."
tampabayrays,3abh32,mkultra3,2,Fri Jun 19 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"I think the likely SS replacements would be Beckham (when back), then Franklin and in a pinch, Forsythe. Zobrist came up as a SS so he was comfortable there due to reps. Based on how they play 2B, I'd rather take Forsythe over Franklin. Franklin has a nice arm but zero range.   Edit: but yeah, the Rays aren't going to get rid of him. He's playing excellent defense right now and they'd hurt the team taking him out and replacing him with Beck or Franklin defensively without the significant offensive boost."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,RaysBot,3,Wed Jun 17 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"I miscounted, our run differential is +12.  Great Win! Let's go for the Series!"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu Jun 18 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"I'm at the game! It was a good one, minus the rain. Nationals park is one of the better ones I've been to so far."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,bballdeo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:12:32 2015 UTC,I was at the game too! Was a good one.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,YouEnjoyMyself84,2,Thu Jun 18 05:25:49 2015 UTC,Hope you had a hat or something.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:17:18 2015 UTC,I had nothing! Dark Sky betrayed me. Said there wouldn't be rain until 11pm.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,bballdeo,2,Thu Jun 18 03:40:24 2015 UTC,"Ouch! I know that feel though. I went to visit the Marlins spring complex for a game this March. The weather forecast looked fine so I didn't bring any hat with me into the park (my car is loaded with various hats for rainy days). Sure enough, it starts drizzling before first pitch. By the third inning, it was a downpour. It eventually cleared up but by that point Ichiro and Stanton were long gone from the game so I was pissed lol."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"Oh that's the worst, considering how bad the spring complexes are for inclement weather. They were probably happy it cleared up for their tee time, though!"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,bballdeo,2,Thu Jun 18 03:47:32 2015 UTC,Yeah it was pretty bad. I tried to take shelter but the concourse was packed so I stuck it out in the seating area.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 04:14:28 2015 UTC,Love the bullpen win.

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,3,Thu Jun 18 02:11:06 2015 UTC,I'm glad that our strategy of getting them tired on the base-pads yesterday has worked out.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,FuriousTarts,5,Thu Jun 18 02:10:11 2015 UTC,So....why did we almost lose this guy? He's actually a much needed guy in the pen. Need someone with a heavy sinker.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,5,Thu Jun 18 02:09:54 2015 UTC,Not a bad swing from the Pitcher... alright to have for these NL games.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 01:58:12 2015 UTC,Offense from a Catcher!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 01:56:12 2015 UTC,Looks like a Robero Hernandez RP to me.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,3,Thu Jun 18 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"Belesario opts out, signs with Rays anyway. Might be here for the long haul as well. Rather see him than Enny Romero for now."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,2,Thu Jun 18 01:48:45 2015 UTC,That infield still looks pretty rough.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jun 18 01:47:53 2015 UTC,Nice little kiddie pool between 1st and 2nd
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,PinheadRecords,6,Thu Jun 18 01:49:12 2015 UTC,Game not over. :-|
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jun 18 01:25:48 2015 UTC,Then lets tack on some runs and fix our differential! Only +11 after last nights debacle.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu Jun 18 01:38:52 2015 UTC,DID I MENTION LAST NIGHT HOW AWESOME THAT GAME WAS TO ATTEND???!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 01:40:19 2015 UTC,Game's Over! That Infield isn't salvageable enough to continue.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they waited too long to cover it up.   But who knows? They've got that magic powder these days."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,6,Thu Jun 18 01:21:44 2015 UTC,Cocaine?
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,anonymau5,3,Thu Jun 18 01:31:27 2015 UTC,Essentially
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,5,Thu Jun 18 01:34:43 2015 UTC,"Aw, just give us the win"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,6,Thu Jun 18 01:18:47 2015 UTC,"Welp, its a rainy night here in Brussels, the sound of the rain on the micro from the game is soothing. Rays are winning, this is the happiest Ive been in a long time!"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Thu Jun 18 01:18:37 2015 UTC,Jeez. Finally.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jun 18 01:18:14 2015 UTC,Please Mr Statistician man! Score it a HR! Overthrows aren't always necessarily errors.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 01:17:46 2015 UTC,The ball was slick. Nobody was making that first throw.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jun 18 01:20:28 2015 UTC,Alright it's 5 runs in the 8th now. Lets just call it already.

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,5,Thu Jun 18 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"Now on to Sunsports new segment, people struggling to put on rain gear!"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Thu Jun 18 01:05:39 2015 UTC,I actually enjoyed that. Made me feel better about my shortcomings.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:11:37 2015 UTC,Yelich just broke up Pineda no hitter. I shiver at what might have been. Thank you Christian.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,7,Thu Jun 18 01:04:37 2015 UTC,I'm glad we have an indoor stadium
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,PinheadRecords,2,Thu Jun 18 01:01:33 2015 UTC,If/when we move (and I hope to God it's somewhere in the Bay) we need to stay indoors. Part of our identity.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:03:56 2015 UTC,I guess I'm in the minority but I like having the stadium in St. Pete! All I've gotta do to get there is drive down 19 for 30 minutes :)
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,PinheadRecords,2,Thu Jun 18 01:06:04 2015 UTC,Well I wouldnt mind if the Rays relocated to Brussels...
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,0,Thu Jun 18 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it in St. Pete, it's just where in the city it is. St. Pete is a city with wide city limits. Certainly it can get closer to Tampa."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:08:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm biased, after living in St Pete for so long, but I actually like that Tropicana is indoor, and the location. I used to love in the Old Northeast, and games were walkable. It was great to say that we were ""Tampa Bay"" and not just ""Tampa"", and having the Rays in town really helps that."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,juicemagic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:55:02 2015 UTC,"St. Pete is in the Bay area, though, right? Just as long as the Stadium is in Central Florida, I couldn't care if they go to Orlando. (Actually a lot closer for me.)"

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:03:34 2015 UTC,Jepsen needs to stop drinking before the game /s  Hope he's okay.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 00:59:51 2015 UTC,HEY LETS KEEP PLAYING IN POURING RAIN  NO DANGER AT ALL
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 00:59:32 2015 UTC,I love to listen to Duane and BA talking bout the Rays. It makes me realize they are one of us.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,3,Thu Jun 18 00:56:30 2015 UTC,Is Jaso not a catcher?
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,FuriousTarts,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:54:01 2015 UTC,"He was, I think the As just used him as a DH because his catching ability was far from good, we'll probably do the same"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,2,Thu Jun 18 00:56:45 2015 UTC,"Joey Bats, though..."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Thu Jun 18 00:57:59 2015 UTC,Yes but he is not fit enough (history of concussions) to play the position.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,4,Thu Jun 18 00:55:52 2015 UTC,Damn.  That would be perfect.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,FuriousTarts,3,Thu Jun 18 00:56:56 2015 UTC,Hope they can get this game to the point were they can just call it instead of a delay.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,5,Thu Jun 18 00:50:08 2015 UTC,Watching this poor man struggle to get his rain coat on is disheartening.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Veber31,8,Thu Jun 18 00:48:36 2015 UTC,Sweet. Rain.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,6,Thu Jun 18 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'll call the game, and we won't have to use any more pitchers?  I can dream, can't I?"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu Jun 18 00:48:16 2015 UTC,Looks like it's letting up. Guess it'll remain a dream.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,5,Thu Jun 18 00:54:02 2015 UTC,A ... wet dream? . . . I'll let myself out...
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Thu Jun 18 01:00:50 2015 UTC,ಠ_ಠ
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 01:06:00 2015 UTC,Picking up again.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,0,Thu Jun 18 01:00:16 2015 UTC,This is why I didn't go to school for meteorology.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, you were doing fine. 10% accuracy is top of the line."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu Jun 18 01:09:42 2015 UTC,"Andriese is pitching well! This uncanny rotation is rounding into form, except for Colome...maybe give Romero a chance? But I guess he needs more control."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Thu Jun 18 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"Very solid outing by Andriese so far, nice nice"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,2,Thu Jun 18 00:42:23 2015 UTC,A Rays selfie stick? My god...
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,3,Thu Jun 18 00:42:01 2015 UTC,Finally. Like hell I was gonna pay for my own selfie stick.

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,2,Thu Jun 18 00:34:30 2015 UTC,So Desmonds out for 8 weeks? What are we gonna do when he comes back?
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu Jun 18 00:33:01 2015 UTC,"Lol that's the 1 million dollar question. Can't kick out Joey Butts at this rate.   Just me speculating, but I think this is the last year Dezy is with the team. Sorry, seeing your username and everything :/"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,3,Thu Jun 18 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, seeing your username and everything :/   We all have our crosses to bear with usernames. Try not proofreading the word millionaire when registering."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,2,Thu Jun 18 00:43:00 2015 UTC,Krapmule... just kidding haha
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Thu Jun 18 00:57:36 2015 UTC,"Joey Butts, made me chuckle. No way he is getting send down."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Thu Jun 18 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Thats a really good question, sadly Butler may get the boot"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,2,Thu Jun 18 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"Unless we can get an Outfielder playing inside, and just make Cabby a bench player."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"With how Cabby has been playing defensively, and drawing such high praise from Cash, I don't necessarily see that happening"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,2,Thu Jun 18 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but his hitting hasn't helped his case. He was brought in to do just that, and he's batting .200. I like Cabby, too, but we need all the bats we can get."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu Jun 18 00:53:33 2015 UTC,Kids bop kids concert.. Not sure how I feel about that..

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,3,Thu Jun 18 00:17:58 2015 UTC,Special Kiermaier!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 00:19:03 2015 UTC,Lmao that was awesome.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu Jun 18 00:18:17 2015 UTC,What did I told you all? Baseball vision!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,7,Thu Jun 18 00:12:11 2015 UTC,Ahhhyeahh! A HR from a catcher! Always had a good bat in the minors too!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,2,Thu Jun 18 00:11:23 2015 UTC,Souza has been on a tear this week.
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Veber31,5,Thu Jun 18 00:11:16 2015 UTC,"Man, Casali, I see you hitting .250! Then a HR!"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,0,Thu Jun 18 00:11:10 2015 UTC,Dayyyyyymn son

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,2,Thu Jun 18 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"HR, 13th!"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Thu Jun 18 00:07:27 2015 UTC,Have a game Souza!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,xiedian,4,Thu Jun 18 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"So what was the reasoning behind Geltz starting and Andriese getting in there now?  It seems to have worked so far, I'm just curious."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,FuriousTarts,3,Wed Jun 17 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the thought behind it was that Geltz would go about 2 innings (ie. one time through the order for the Rays), so Cash would pinch hit for the pitcher that first spot. Andriese is supposed to go a bit more, so Cash can PH him or not depending on how he's doing.  It's a way to force a real hitter into that starting pitching slot.   Plan backfired when Guyer GIDPd. I remember it 'working' in Miami earlier this season."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,3,Wed Jun 17 23:52:01 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks for the explanation."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,FuriousTarts,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:57:19 2015 UTC,Taking away Geltz his no hitter! C'mon Cash!

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,joeydeno,6,Wed Jun 17 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"I like Casali, I was bummed he wasnt on the 40 man roster in the beginning of the season. Glad to see him back."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"He was on the 40 man...to get taken off the 40 man you have to clear waivers, they just out righted him to AAA, never left the 40 mam...I don't think"
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,I_Eat_Your_Pets,2,Thu Jun 18 00:39:25 2015 UTC,Beautiful movement. Bye bye Harper

tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Wed Jun 17 22:55:29 2015 UTC,Bullpen by committee night?
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,2015RaysTime,2,Wed Jun 17 22:57:21 2015 UTC,Ah I thought somebody else was scheduled!
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,Krapul,2,Wed Jun 17 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Andriese will make a prolonged appearance, but I guess it's at the right time."
tampabayrays,3a7ay8,mkultra3,4,Wed Jun 17 23:10:21 2015 UTC,Last time I saw the Rays play at Nats Park (while I was living in DC) was Chris Archer's first start in the major leagues. Crazy how far he's come since then.  Gonna be a bullpen game with Geltz starting and Andriese making an appearance somewhere in it. Gonna be interesting!

Man, I remember that one game Cobb pitched when he just came up and gave up 7 ERs in the 2nd, put stayed in the game until the 8th to save the pen. He really proved himself that game to the fans and the rest of the team. Props to Rief for pitching 2, because he's normally 1 and done....  But Colome and Romero? Come on, you guys are pitchers who have said you want to be SPs. I hope Romero can stay in for longer and suck it up but I dont have too much hope. Where's Andresie and Bellatti when you need them :("
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,2,Wed Jun 17 01:07:19 2015 UTC,Ramos was quite good for going 3 or so when you needed him to

tampabayrays,3a2uvk,wolfzr2,3,Wed Jun 17 00:50:17 2015 UTC,IM SO GLAD I DECIDED TO COME TONIGHT.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,millionaremattdavis,3,Wed Jun 17 00:38:27 2015 UTC,if u guys wanna come over here and cheer us on come over we would love u guys to party with us
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,joeydeno,3,Wed Jun 17 00:32:38 2015 UTC,Here's hoping Rief can go 3 or 4 innings.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,ophiuroid,3,Wed Jun 17 00:30:35 2015 UTC,Nice ground balls that inning
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,ophiuroid,3,Wed Jun 17 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, time to start chopping away at this lead..."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,USCswimmer,5,Wed Jun 17 00:20:30 2015 UTC,dont know if u guys care or not but  mets 3 jays 0 b3 2 out runners on 1st and 2nd
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,joeydeno,3,Wed Jun 17 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"That's cool, keep them from gaining on us. Marlins (who I'm sure you don't really care seeing as they're like 10 games down) are also beating the Yankees, so we're likely still in first by a game."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Wed Jun 17 00:09:44 2015 UTC,no we need the marlins to lose because they are starting to get their shit together sooo the yanks better step it up   we will cover for u guys tonight and the next 2 nights
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,joeydeno,2,Wed Jun 17 00:10:40 2015 UTC,"It's 8-0, so it looks like the Marlins are gonna take that game."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:14:17 2015 UTC,"But our game is only 0-6, so we still have a chance."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,ophiuroid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"Probably not, but I'd like to hope."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Wed Jun 17 00:17:04 2015 UTC,Oh yay more injuries
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,colwell25,6,Wed Jun 17 00:05:41 2015 UTC,Me coming back from the bathroom to see what's happened in the game since I've been gone
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,DylanRamsey,3,Wed Jun 17 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"No shit dude, I just went to eat dinner and came back to see they put up another 3 runs... What the hell"
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,PinheadRecords,4,Wed Jun 17 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"Nice arm KK, nice tag Rivera. The bleeding is over. Probably will be seeing Colome back in the third with an extremely short leash.  So demoralizing, 0-6, feels like we've lost this one already. Hopefully this doesn't get in the heads of the offense."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,5,Wed Jun 17 00:00:41 2015 UTC,Oh goodness Rivera that is an astonishing tag
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,colwell25,5,Tue Jun 16 23:59:30 2015 UTC,If we don't get that tag...three more runs this inning?
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,ophiuroid,5,Tue Jun 16 23:59:57 2015 UTC,I don't even want to think about  it.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,colwell25,4,Wed Jun 17 00:05:32 2015 UTC,Damn nice play by Rivera.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Veber31,5,Tue Jun 16 23:59:17 2015 UTC,God help our bullpen
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,xiedian,3,Tue Jun 16 23:55:06 2015 UTC,Colome's allowed 9 men to reach and got 4 outs
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,colwell25,3,Tue Jun 16 23:54:19 2015 UTC,God help us
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,PinheadRecords,3,Tue Jun 16 23:53:34 2015 UTC,You're embarrassing yourself man..
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,xiedian,4,Tue Jun 16 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"Just leave Colome in and concede the game... he can't get any worse, and just pray we can score 4 out of nowhere."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Tue Jun 16 23:51:09 2015 UTC,Can Archer play every game please?
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Veber31,3,Tue Jun 16 23:50:20 2015 UTC,Remember Bishop last year for the Bolts (if you follow them).  How about ever other night?
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,formerlyme0341,6,Wed Jun 17 00:34:28 2015 UTC,Colome need to be the first person that gets the boot when Moore comes back. Erasmo may not be perfect but he really has improved from his early season bed shitting. I just don't see Colome improving this season
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,CooperEarly,2,Tue Jun 16 23:50:01 2015 UTC,"I remember when people here were clamoring for him to be the 5th starter over Karns. The guy doesn't have a third pitch and he's got wild command. Cant be a starter without that solid third pitch, especially when you cant find the zone."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,3,Tue Jun 16 23:55:15 2015 UTC,I'm not gonna lie I was one of those people lol. But trust me I've had more than enough
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,CooperEarly,5,Tue Jun 16 23:57:15 2015 UTC,Horrible showing by Colome so far
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,PinheadRecords,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:49:32 2015 UTC,No control at all right now.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,ophiuroid,3,Tue Jun 16 23:53:21 2015 UTC,"Colome is the type of pitcher to do well in AAA, but will never really find a way to put it all together in the big leagues"
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,xiedian,2,Tue Jun 16 23:49:09 2015 UTC,*as a starter. I still think he could be good in the bullpen.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,3,Tue Jun 16 23:55:46 2015 UTC,Ugh! C'mon Colome!
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,yoshimane,3,Tue Jun 16 23:49:03 2015 UTC,That isn't the best run ever.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,ophiuroid,5,Tue Jun 16 23:48:56 2015 UTC,God damn Colome.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Veber31,5,Tue Jun 16 23:48:31 2015 UTC,Damnit Colome you better not walk this guy in....
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,7,Tue Jun 16 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"You gotta throw a strike no matter what here, Colome. A hit is around the same as a walk."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jun 16 23:47:37 2015 UTC,Loading the bases for the heart of the lineup? Oyyy
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,5,Tue Jun 16 23:45:29 2015 UTC,coming back to say LGR were pulling for u guys again
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,joeydeno,3,Tue Jun 16 23:45:24 2015 UTC,ily bb <3  hope your guys can win again tonight so the Blue Jays circle jerk can be quieted down
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,CooperEarly,2,Tue Jun 16 23:51:23 2015 UTC,we did last night and were up 2-0 on an rbi double by matt harvey   were gonna try and do our part again tonight guys no worries we all help each other
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,joeydeno,4,Tue Jun 16 23:52:56 2015 UTC,"Blue Jays are down, and the Yankees are losing big, so it makes a potential loss a little less painful."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jun 16 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"Please win, come on."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Agothro,9,Tue Jun 16 23:45:03 2015 UTC,Well that makes us look kind of silly... back to back bunts.  Hopefully turn 2 here.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,USCswimmer,3,Tue Jun 16 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"He's safe, probably had a better chance with the other one."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,8,Tue Jun 16 23:36:49 2015 UTC,I want Matt Moore back so badly right now
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,xiedian,3,Tue Jun 16 23:36:43 2015 UTC,FP is losing it. Need a DP here for my sanity.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,tedinasitcom,4,Tue Jun 16 23:36:24 2015 UTC,At least the Yankees game is 0-6 Marlins... and we can still come back... maybe.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue Jun 16 23:35:20 2015 UTC,S i g h
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,xiedian,3,Tue Jun 16 23:35:03 2015 UTC,Crappp. That was smoked.
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,3,Tue Jun 16 23:34:36 2015 UTC,Butler's walk up music.. Sigh
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,xiedian,4,Tue Jun 16 23:26:31 2015 UTC,"That intro video got me pumped up, let's win this one today and keep it going!!!"
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,USCswimmer,3,Tue Jun 16 23:02:56 2015 UTC,"Lets keep the train a'rollin! Worried about Colome though, hopefully he can command his stuff today."
tampabayrays,3a2uvk,mkultra3,5,Tue Jun 16 23:00:04 2015 UTC,He gave up his slingbox so that we may have life!

tampabayrays,3a0e51,JoebobZanzibar,20,Tue Jun 16 06:24:24 2015 UTC,How is this possible!? Seven pitchers on the DL and still have that Rays spirit we've all grown to love. This team never ceases to amaze me!
tampabayrays,3a0e51,fricksickpick,20,Tue Jun 16 12:37:22 2015 UTC,now they need to go undefeated so I can move on from the lightning loss
tampabayrays,3a0e51,princeofbel-air,11,Tue Jun 16 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"Still not really sure how we're doing this. Our team ERA is outstanding and our defense is stout, but our offensive stats are mediocre. And with all the injuries...credit Cash for keeping the aggressive base-running and team focus."
tampabayrays,3a0e51,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Tue Jun 16 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"Hasn't this been the case with almost every successful Rays team? That is, with the exceptions of maybe 2009 and 2014 when we thought we'd have the strongest offense yet, and both years were utter dissapointments."
tampabayrays,3a0e51,mkultra3,2,Tue Jun 16 20:51:00 2015 UTC,pitching and D have been our hallmarks for years now but this year's team just seems like we keep pulling rabbits out of hats with some of the guys we put on the field.
tampabayrays,3a0e51,TheCenterOfEnnui,9,Tue Jun 16 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"So much grit and grind. Watching this team has been a blast.  I dont know when the Joey Butts flame gets extinguished (batting with a .460 BABIP, though a very healthy hard hit % and LD%), but he's been a very good Loney replacement (putting dat ball in play!) Same goes for Elmore!    Also, props to Eramso for figuring shit out:   Erasmo in April: 11.1 IP, ERA 12.71, 9 SO, 7 BB Erasmo in May/June: 47.1 IP, ERA 2.47, 39 SO, 14 BB"
tampabayrays,3a0e51,mkultra3,8,Tue Jun 16 12:59:07 2015 UTC,"Everyone's talking about how great the jays are doing, yet here we sit silently in first place for the second time this year when we were predicted to be shit."
tampabayrays,3a0e51,Dirtydirtdirtt,5,Tue Jun 16 16:35:50 2015 UTC,Let's keep it that way please haha
tampabayrays,3a0e51,BigHamPorter,3,Tue Jun 16 17:46:57 2015 UTC,#12 in the power rankings!    Please continue to underrate us media and other fans. This is where we thrive.
tampabayrays,3a0e51,zeitfalle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:52:01 2015 UTC,Rays finally started driving in all those left on base
tampabayrays,39y8q6,GiveMeSomeRaptorNews,7,Mon Jun 15 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"Can he play 1B? If not, then what the hell are they doing?"
tampabayrays,39y8q6,zbrasseur1,4,Mon Jun 15 20:38:55 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Our OF isn't exactly a weak spot right now. How long is Loney expected to be out?
tampabayrays,39y8q6,kingfishcoons,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think this is a potential upside play. It's a chance for the Rays staff to figure out what's wrong with a former five-tool all star and seeing if he's salvagable (or for data). If he is, having him with the team would be huge. If not, they'd cut bait. He's reported to Charlotte (high A ball along with the extended spring training site and raw rookie league) where a lot of the trainers and developmental staff are. I bet he's going to do a fair share of working out and tests with the physicians and less of game time."
tampabayrays,39y8q6,mkultra3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:02:58 2015 UTC,They want to break the record for most guys on the DL

The prices generally go down to $5-6 the day of game, so if you don't mind waiting unit last minute you can get some cheap tix.   Edit: you can use the code SUPERBOOM1781 and get 10 dollars in credit which can sometimes even get two tickets."

tampabayrays,39u5n6,DCGary,8,Sun Jun 14 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"Roughly 15 minutes prior to game time. Stand by the group of people with sharpies in the front row on the first baseline usually anywhere from the dugout to the bullpen. The players come out to stretch about 20 minutes prior to the game, each guy kind of does his own thing. As they are done stretching they will typically come over and sign a few autographs. Don't expect every guy to stop and don't expect every guy to sign or interact. It's kind of a luck of the draw thing. To get a really decent spot you're going to want to get to that area while the opposing team is taking bp just to position yourself, it's hard to get autographs from the second or third row and there will be a bit of a crowd to compete with."

tampabayrays,39t0ri,mkultra3,4,Sun Jun 14 19:53:36 2015 UTC,Wasn't that Cabby's team last year?
tampabayrays,39t0ri,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sun Jun 14 19:55:48 2015 UTC,Kind of? He was traded there in July and kind of sucked. I bet both sides would like to forget Cabby's tenure in Washington.

tampabayrays,39t0ri,xiedian,3,Sun Jun 14 19:50:34 2015 UTC,Jepsen in to close it out. The last few times he's been out there it's been an adventure. Hoepfully this can be a stress-free 9th.

tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but if I had to speculate, it's a guy who probably sucks. Maybe a pitcher they'd expect to give up a ton of runs but had to just get deep in the game."

tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Man, that was an odd walk..."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sun Jun 14 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"The pitch fx guys just fucked up, thats all.    That first pitch may have been in the zone, but the way the catcher stabbed at it, it was never gonna get called"
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,4,Sun Jun 14 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was gonna say that first pitch was definitely a ball."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,4,Sun Jun 14 19:11:44 2015 UTC,Rivera is a fuckin' monster!
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,0,Sun Jun 14 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, so was Molina."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,YouEnjoyMyself84,2,Sun Jun 14 19:12:09 2015 UTC,Jose was shit at throwing out runners. Rivera is a boss at it.
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,6,Sun Jun 14 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"Cabrera with the great play, as always"
tampabayrays,39t0ri,PinheadRecords,5,Sun Jun 14 19:05:08 2015 UTC,Jesus that was a shitty bunt attempt
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,4,Sun Jun 14 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, thats a bad read, Guyer.    Tough read though, the way the ball came off the bat."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 19:02:44 2015 UTC,Are we turning Enny Romero into Alexander Torres? Have we given up on him starting?
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, lets get Karns the win!"
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 18:51:12 2015 UTC,Karns dealing today.
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Back from a long wedding weekend. Didnt get to see any games yet (will probably catch up today) but glad to see Rays are hanging in there with the Yanks!  Listened to this game for a bit.  We had so many opportunities. Is it more of a ""Chris Sale being his usual nasty self"" or are we getting too aggressive?"
tampabayrays,39t0ri,mkultra3,3,Sun Jun 14 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Last inning: too aggressive, game wise, our approach has been solid, but Evan Longoria has been murdered in two important ABs for our only two chances of the game.    Sale's slider and heater have been on, but he hasn't been locating his best. Missing a lot of pitches way outside the zone. For reference: Joey Butler made it to a 2 ball count (he took two pitches!)    Last inning, he started at 74 pitches and only made it up to 82 because of incredibly poor ABs from Franklin and Rivera.    Our goal should be to get Sale out of the game, right now. He's just too hard to hit."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jun 14 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"I was in the middle of a response about knocking Chris sale out, but all is lost with that go-head HR from Cabby!  Hopefully the pen can lock it down."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,mkultra3,2,Sun Jun 14 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Damn guys, 4 pitches 2 outs. The only thing we were doing well was making him throw pitches. Edit 8 pitch inning, shitty. We had him over 70 through 4."
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jun 14 18:41:53 2015 UTC,Oh shit. Bat into the crowd! The Boston Globe is going to write fifteen articles blaming the victim.
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jun 14 18:29:36 2015 UTC,That coulda been bad
tampabayrays,39t0ri,PinheadRecords,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:29:17 2015 UTC,Another day with no offense. What else is new?
tampabayrays,39t0ri,YouEnjoyMyself84,2,Sun Jun 14 18:26:40 2015 UTC,Chris Sale is just out mowing the lawn.    I wish we drafted him and not Josh.
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jun 14 18:25:56 2015 UTC,Longo made to look like a fool on that pitch.
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jun 14 18:07:11 2015 UTC,How is Gordon Beckham still an everyday major league player?
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,2,Sun Jun 14 18:04:29 2015 UTC,Where's everybody at? Still hung over from the Lightning game last night?
tampabayrays,39t0ri,PinheadRecords,3,Sun Jun 14 17:44:00 2015 UTC,Forgot the game was this early!
tampabayrays,39t0ri,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 17:59:47 2015 UTC,I knew how early it was but wasn't able to drag myself out of bed til 1:30 :P
tampabayrays,39ror1,Rays8JenningsFan,12,Sun Jun 14 02:32:45 2015 UTC,How this team wins is nothing short of astounding. We've got band-aids on band-aids. Just pure grit and determination. Glad our offense helped Archer get the win tonight.  Also... Why did Toronto have to realize they didn't suck though? A game back!
tampabayrays,39ror1,jinxnotit,5,Sun Jun 14 04:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Toronto's been on a tear lately... Same with the Orioles. Things are starting to heat up in the AL East!"
tampabayrays,39ror1,PinheadRecords,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:50:00 2015 UTC,This is so true. I think we may have to ask Longoria to pitch soon.
tampabayrays,39ror1,TheCenterOfEnnui,7,Sun Jun 14 15:57:24 2015 UTC,OH YEAH!

tampabayrays,39qwlc,zeitfalle,5,Sat Jun 13 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"Well, he needs to give us the 5% probability right now."
tampabayrays,39qwlc,VirtuaSaturn,3,Sat Jun 13 22:33:52 2015 UTC,"Using my quick and likely flawed calculations, Souza is on pace to play 146 games, hit 30-31 home runs, steal 20-21 bases, and strike out 208 times. He's pretty much a Chris Davis that can steal so far and I'm fine with that, and considering he's only a rookie there's a chance he can fix the Ks a little bit and possibly bring up his average to .240-.250. That would make me forget about Wil Myers fairly quickly"
tampabayrays,39qwlc,treyfromthebay,3,Sun Jun 14 02:19:06 2015 UTC,I'm just stoked that he plays hard and has a 10% walk rate. Most young players won't sniff a walk rate that high.
tampabayrays,39q0po,RaysBot,3,Sat Jun 13 17:10:07 2015 UTC,Nice. Go get em lighting!
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,5,Sat Jun 13 22:58:49 2015 UTC,Nice series win. Hopefully a good outing tomorrow. Ill be at a couple games next series in DC. Lets start a streak here.

tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jun 13 22:46:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, Franky, same as last time, but with a little more distance."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:46:28 2015 UTC,Alexei Ramirez is having a nightmare game defensively
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:45:37 2015 UTC,Hell yea! Nice baserunning Souz!
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:45:27 2015 UTC,ALL THE WAY BACK!
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 22:45:01 2015 UTC,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
tampabayrays,39q0po,USCswimmer,2,Sat Jun 13 22:44:57 2015 UTC,"Why intentional Cabby? He hasn't been too great hitting this year, and an accidental walk on a guy, when the new pitcher is trying to get his feet wet can be brutal."
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 22:41:54 2015 UTC,Droobs with an IBB?
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:41:37 2015 UTC,100 percent safe but got a bad feeling.
tampabayrays,39q0po,YouEnjoyMyself84,3,Sat Jun 13 22:37:19 2015 UTC,He's totally in.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"Throw out the Red Flag! He's in there! Baseman not on the plate, Foot beats the tag!"

tampabayrays,39q0po,Veber31,3,Sat Jun 13 22:33:55 2015 UTC,Good AB from Souz
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:32:55 2015 UTC,Can Souza please just knock this one out?
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"Thats not a strike, ump."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"Jesus, how does that even work? 6 pitches, all splitters down."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:26:59 2015 UTC,WTF happened?? I walked away for 5 minutes during the pitcher change...
tampabayrays,39q0po,USCswimmer,3,Sat Jun 13 22:12:25 2015 UTC,archer walked a guy so cash put in box and he immediately gave up a hr
tampabayrays,39q0po,YouEnjoyMyself84,4,Sat Jun 13 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"Why do we always pull Archer in the 8th... he clearly can go the distance, that walk didn't even look sloppy."
tampabayrays,39q0po,USCswimmer,3,Sat Jun 13 22:18:35 2015 UTC,Box gave up a dinger to Gillaspie
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"If Boxberger wasn't so homer prone, he'd probably be an under 2 ERA kind of guy."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:11:09 2015 UTC,Come on.
tampabayrays,39q0po,Veber31,5,Sat Jun 13 22:10:24 2015 UTC,GODDAMMIT CASH HAVE SOME FAITH IN YOUR STARTERS UGH
tampabayrays,39q0po,botts,3,Sat Jun 13 22:09:13 2015 UTC,Fuckity fuck fuck.
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 13 22:09:04 2015 UTC,Fuckin shit. Pulling Archer early has NOT worked for us this year.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 22:09:04 2015 UTC,DAMNIT!
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"Can our pitchers just not catch a break? When ever we need someone to go just a little deeper, something always fucks it up."
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jun 13 22:04:14 2015 UTC,Hell of a start yet again from Arch
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,6,Sat Jun 13 22:04:01 2015 UTC,Damn. You know you have an ace pitcher when you're disappointed he issues a walk
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 13 22:03:37 2015 UTC,What happened there?
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 13 21:57:06 2015 UTC,Alexei couldn't get a grip.
tampabayrays,39q0po,LithopsEffect,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense. Looked like there would be enough time if he fielded that cleanly, but couldn't really see the ball 100%"
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 13 22:00:18 2015 UTC,GOT THE RUN!
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jun 13 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"Alright LoFo, get it done."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 21:55:23 2015 UTC,TRIPLE! That was inches from a lead change... hopefully we can get a hit to bring him home.
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 21:54:24 2015 UTC,YUSSSS!! Franky!

tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 21:48:39 2015 UTC,Mike Montgomery making his third start for the Mariners today. Got 3  shutout innings so far. He's doing really well over there.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 21:37:31 2015 UTC,"Man, the Ump is late on the Calls."
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 21:36:26 2015 UTC,Ahhh fuck. Right down the pipe Longo :(    You can just tell he was guessing offspeed.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,4,Sat Jun 13 21:32:58 2015 UTC,There might be another guy worthy of the name Joey Bats in our division. Butler and Souza for co ALROY
tampabayrays,39q0po,CooperEarly,3,Sat Jun 13 21:31:33 2015 UTC,Keirmaiers base running ability never ceases to amaze me. LETS GO LONGO
tampabayrays,39q0po,CooperEarly,3,Sat Jun 13 21:30:30 2015 UTC,Joey Buts!
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,5,Sat Jun 13 21:30:01 2015 UTC,Corners! Lezgo Longo!

tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"Hey, It's Frank-lin!"
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jun 13 21:23:27 2015 UTC,"That 1-1 slider to Shuck was an absolutely perfect backdoor.    Sometimes, Archer amazes me."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 21:20:54 2015 UTC,Nice slide piece to get out of the inning
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 21:08:48 2015 UTC,"That wasn't a good play, we could have gotten more out of that."
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 21:05:16 2015 UTC,There we go!
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"Damn, if that doesn't bounce over the fence, he's home for sure."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:53:34 2015 UTC,We gotta jump on Shark while he's still not settled in!
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:50:45 2015 UTC,Holy shit that changeup was filthy.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:43:14 2015 UTC,Its the Longo Show today.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 20:34:35 2015 UTC,God I hate the White Sox... (Cubs-Rays fan)
tampabayrays,39q0po,HeyItsHayz,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:29:47 2015 UTC,I think a lot of Rays fans are de facto Cubs fans due to the Maddon connection.    I've always watched the Cubs day games on Sundays. That team has really improved from 3-4 years ago.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. You add Maddon and me being from Indiana, I am am a uber-cubs fan. But Rays over Cubs any day."
tampabayrays,39q0po,HeyItsHayz,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"For sure. The Cubs are just a fun team to follow for me.    I guess some Rays fans actually resent Maddon, which is weird from my PoV."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:16:24 2015 UTC,Yeah. He was offered a better deal. What did we really expect? He really turned the page for the Rays organization.
tampabayrays,39q0po,HeyItsHayz,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"Screw Maddon and his ""Tampa is My Home"" shit."
tampabayrays,39q0po,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 13 21:10:30 2015 UTC,Speak for yourself.
tampabayrays,39q0po,YouEnjoyMyself84,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:39:02 2015 UTC,I was
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"And the hanger was the first pitch...damn, he missed a good shot there."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"Still can't locate the fastball, hopefully Souza can run into a hanging slider here."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"Guess this is a sitch where if he was called safe, he would have been safe."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:27:05 2015 UTC,He might've been a hair off the bag before the tag was applied.. Good call
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 13 20:26:46 2015 UTC,Wow... Even the Sox announcers literally just said ''he was safe'' ''we'll take it''.
tampabayrays,39q0po,USCswimmer,2,Sat Jun 13 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"Jeez, slow mo looks like a tie."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,4,Sat Jun 13 20:26:24 2015 UTC,"From my very very objective opinion, he's safe."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:25:15 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's super close"
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,2,Sat Jun 13 20:24:56 2015 UTC,Longooooo!
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:24:30 2015 UTC,Shark not locating too well to start the game. Doesn't have the feel for the fastball yet.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"Woof, thats a Rookie AB."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,3,Sat Jun 13 20:22:48 2015 UTC,KK is honestly one of the fastest people I've ever seen play baseball. He is dead set on a triple every time he gets a ball in the gap
tampabayrays,39q0po,CooperEarly,3,Sat Jun 13 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"Great baserunner, too. Takes good angles"
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"Hell yea, get 3!"
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:21:06 2015 UTC,KK!
tampabayrays,39q0po,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 13 20:21:05 2015 UTC,Its kind of depressing that we have to play Jake Elmore at 1B.    Such a lack of quality hitting depth.
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:20:46 2015 UTC,But he's hitting well....?
tampabayrays,39q0po,botts,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:12:32 2015 UTC,Wait...do people think Elmore is a good hitter?
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"Batting .280? Small sample size yes but still, there's much worse. Beats the hell out of Franklin playing 1B..."
tampabayrays,39q0po,botts,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, I mainly remember Elmo's season with the Astros where he hit like ass. He definitely has contributed a few times for us offensively.    Thing is, 1B is one of the least challenging positions to play defensively and I'd love if we could find a better hitter there. Hence, the lack of quality hitting depth comment. We have to rely on players playing above their heads at this point.    Franky is another thing altogether. I really hope he can get it together."
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 21:29:06 2015 UTC,There we go!
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,2,Sat Jun 13 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"Alright Arch, settle in"
tampabayrays,39q0po,zeitfalle,5,Sat Jun 13 20:16:43 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see Archer play today! Go rays.
tampabayrays,39q0po,Veber31,3,Sat Jun 13 17:38:29 2015 UTC,Can't wait to listen to a low quality white sox radio broadcast because my At-Bat account is messed up.

I ordered the rays hat in the photo and it has this little hump and indent on the side of the hat where it connects to the rim due to incapability  of the postal service to deliver the hat correctly.

tampabayrays,39j9ap,mkultra3,4,Fri Jun 12 02:52:36 2015 UTC,"Really needed that bullpen help today!  Rays are recalling Enny Romero, CJ Riefenhauser  and Matt Andriese (who will ""start""). Can see two of these guys logging in significant innings today, probably Andreise and Romero with Rifenhauser getting thrown in there as the LOOGY.   I can also see Casali replace Wilson as a backup catcher later in the series. For now, Elmore is the backup.   Man, this year's roster manipulation has been ridiculous. Props to the FO for having the depth and adapting to all these injuries and SP usage."
tampabayrays,39j9ap,Kennertron,3,Fri Jun 12 12:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'm saddened that they DFA'd Wilson, though. He was a good catcher and seemed to work well with Archer. I'm hoping that there's a ""gentleman's agreement"" that they want to get him to AAA to keep him in the club and that he'll be brought back later, but I think that his performance this year means that he'll be picked up by someone else."
tampabayrays,39j9ap,mkultra3,3,Fri Jun 12 13:59:20 2015 UTC,I hope so too. The only thing that worries me is if another club puts in a claim for him and we have to give him up.
tampabayrays,39j9ap,Kennertron,2,Fri Jun 12 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"If it happens, it happens. He played well enough to end up somewhere else, for sure. He has to wait 10 days to be traded or clear waivers so I have a feeling that he's done with the Rays, since I don't think they can go without a backup catcher (aside from emergencies with Elmore) for that long. Once Casali comes up I think he's here to stay. Does he still have options left?"

(Pro tip: you can buy an upper deck and party deck seat and move down pretty easily. They stop checking your tickets in section 126 on the home side).   As for parking, there's actually a pretty good amount of free parking near the stadium, if you keep your eyes open. I like parking around 3rd Ave and 19th St. There's a good amount of free street parking there and is easy to exit to the highway from there as well. If all the free street parking is taken up, there's a bunch of lots for $5-10."

tampabayrays,39c9lp,PinheadRecords,2,Wed Jun 10 23:43:43 2015 UTC,Ahhhhh yeahhh! Defense miscues for the Angels = runs for us! The tables have turned.

tampabayrays,39c9lp,mkultra3,3,Wed Jun 10 23:30:59 2015 UTC,That has to be safe

tampabayrays,39c9lp,PinheadRecords,3,Wed Jun 10 23:21:51 2015 UTC,What the hell happened to longo's production this year? Wasn't this supposed to be a bounce-back season?
tampabayrays,39c9lp,xiedian,2,Wed Jun 10 23:20:28 2015 UTC,Not getting anything to hit. He's been taking his walks when he as to a lot. Not a whole lot to drive though.
tampabayrays,39c9lp,mkultra3,4,Wed Jun 10 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"Don't Swing Longo, it's 3-0!  EDIT: That was a terrible call, that was a strike. I'm happy Longo's on, but that's bad for Baseball."

tampabayrays,39c9lp,pokerfacetwin,3,Wed Jun 10 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I'm glad we were able to watch a game like yesterday. It makes me appreciate how hard it is to maintain excellent defense on a day-to-day basis. It's something I'm sure gets taken for granted when it's there and discernibly disastrous when it's not. Hopefully Franklin can get back up on that horse and improve at 1B today.  The winning streak begins again today. Glad to have Longo back in the lineup as well."
tampabayrays,397n85,carney620,4,Tue Jun 9 21:05:09 2015 UTC,This is great. In some of his interviews you can tell that talking about these injuries are the last favorite part of his day.
tampabayrays,397n85,mkultra3,3,Tue Jun 9 21:32:34 2015 UTC,I know he hates it...and we hate having to ask him about it.  But this may be the funniest way to deal with a rough part of an interview.  It certainly made me laugh!
tampabayrays,397n85,mkultra3,3,Tue Jun 9 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Haha no I completely understand, and we thank you because we'd like to know the progress of the ppl on the DL as well (especially with so many people!)

tampabayrays,397et7,PinheadRecords,7,Wed Jun 10 00:58:43 2015 UTC,Franklin has more errors than hits this season. Don't know what Friedman saw in him.

Franklin does have potential but has some serious contact problems he needs to work out (and is now developing bad habits). I really think time at AAA could do him well, but I'm not sure if the Rays want to burn that last option he has."
tampabayrays,397et7,mkultra3,2,Wed Jun 10 01:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he needs to get sent down. He's clearly not good enough to hit in the majors"

Parking there is $10, which is good for the distance away from the Trop (<5 min walk), and the money goes to benefit the school. As an added benefit, there is no shortage of space there, so they don't make you cram your car close to the others."

tampabayrays,393r7j,Dirtydirtdirtt,2,Thu Jun 11 13:40:54 2015 UTC,You can also park at the South Core Garage. It's $5 and when you walk out front of the garage you can take the free trolley to the Trop. They pick up out front of Gate 4 during and after the game (up to 1 hour after the game) and drive you back to the garage. The entrance is on 1st Ave S just east of 2nd St.
tampabayrays,393r7j,thegreatcerebral,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:24:43 2015 UTC,Bayfront hospital has free parking and its like a 10 minute walk to the stadium.
tampabayrays,393r7j,PinheadRecords,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"No no no you all have it wrong :)  Park on the west side of the stadium.  Past Lot1 (look at a map).  Less traffic, shorter walk, easier drive on/off and/or to/from interstate.    Most don't even know there is parking over there.  It's like $10 for non-official lot and I believe $15 for official.    Only down side is...  There is no down side :)"
tampabayrays,38xaz9,RaysBot,2,Sun Jun 7 17:10:24 2015 UTC,Archer does what no other pitcher has ever done is baseball and doesn't get any news coverage. Nice work.

tampabayrays,38xaz9,PinheadRecords,2,Sun Jun 7 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"It will depend on Odorizzi's health. Because of the day off Archer might well start on the 11th if Odo can't, although Romero is now up and he might pitch there instead."
tampabayrays,38xaz9,colwell25,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:24:46 2015 UTC,"I've noticed Chris' starts are 5 days apart so that's what I was going by, but yeah, there is an off day... I've been wanting to see him pitch in person so hopefully the 12th ends up being his next start."

tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,2,Sat Jun 6 04:25:18 2015 UTC,Hahah we're lucky as hell
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,2,Sat Jun 6 04:25:11 2015 UTC,Do these damn pitchers even try to pitch in the zone!? Damnit!
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,7,Sat Jun 6 04:23:19 2015 UTC,Hickey. The man. The legend.
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this has base hit written all over it"
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,2,Sat Jun 6 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bellatti, just flirt with the damn strike zone, instead of throwing strikes! Why not load the bases in a tie game?"
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat Jun 6 04:22:17 2015 UTC,Is it me or have I been seeing a lot of 0 ball 2 strike hits against the rays latley?...
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"Bellatti was a Starter at Durham, right? Would rather us find out from good performance and desire for competition... than injury circumstances..."
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jun 6 04:19:13 2015 UTC,Mike Zunino is a bit like Steven Souza without the power
tampabayrays,38qf35,colwell25,2,Sat Jun 6 04:19:04 2015 UTC,Bahaha cabrera having a little temper tantrum
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,5,Sat Jun 6 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I remember when Cabrera was batting 3rd during the beginning of the season, what was that all about ?"
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,4,Sat Jun 6 04:05:11 2015 UTC,I don't know but he has been a dissapointment up to this point in the season
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,4,Sat Jun 6 04:06:41 2015 UTC,"Its strange, Rivera and Cabrera come over, who weren't too bad on the offensive end last season, and they're both hitting borderline .200, Escobar goes over to the Nats and he's hitting over .300"
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,5,Sat Jun 6 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"It's odd, same thing happened to pat Burrell, but for every one of those we have a bj upton, Carl crawford, and carlos pena"
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,2,Sat Jun 6 04:15:56 2015 UTC,"That's 2 innings that we give them first pitch outs, what the hell"
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,2,Sat Jun 6 04:01:49 2015 UTC,"Bellati on point, whoa"
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,5,Sat Jun 6 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, nice inning bellatti"
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,4,Sat Jun 6 03:59:21 2015 UTC,What's the best rays concert you ever went to?  For me it was weezer
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,4,Sat Jun 6 03:53:16 2015 UTC,One Republic was pretty decent a few years ago.
tampabayrays,38qf35,millionaremattdavis,2,Sat Jun 6 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"I wanted to see them, I wish I would have gone to see hall and oats, stI'll kicking myself for missing that one"
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,3,Sat Jun 6 04:04:12 2015 UTC,Whoa. Wait what. When did Hall & Oates play?
tampabayrays,38qf35,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:09:29 2015 UTC,"Few years ago, I wish they would come back"
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:18:45 2015 UTC,Damn. I missed out I guess.

tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,7,Sat Jun 6 03:50:32 2015 UTC,That's fine. I'm ok seeing forsythe at the plate here.
tampabayrays,38qf35,mkultra3,2,Sat Jun 6 03:49:41 2015 UTC,That's two men on! C'mon Forsythe!
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat Jun 6 03:49:17 2015 UTC,Sorry to say it M's but Longo isn't worth an intentional walk this season
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:49:17 2015 UTC,Love Butler's plate approach
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,2,Sat Jun 6 03:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well, at least we get some Hot, Lefty on Lefty action."
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"Damn, if Jakes gone for a while we are going to nosedive."
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,5,Sat Jun 6 03:40:56 2015 UTC,M's fan checking in to say that's a bummer.  We had a real great duel going on.  Hope it's nothing serious
tampabayrays,38qf35,dumbrock,4,Sat Jun 6 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"We hope so too, considering that 3 of our very good SPs are on the DL"
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 6 03:38:45 2015 UTC,Oh god dammit.
tampabayrays,38qf35,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:35:06 2015 UTC,"One more pitcher on the DL, I swear, one more..."
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,6,Sat Jun 6 03:34:44 2015 UTC,You have got to be shitting me
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,4,Sat Jun 6 03:33:06 2015 UTC,Ah shit.
tampabayrays,38qf35,mkultra3,4,Sat Jun 6 03:32:00 2015 UTC,No..
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,5,Sat Jun 6 03:31:47 2015 UTC,Hope it's just a little pull. Please just be a pull...
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"Why Odorizzi, why? Get it in the ZONE!"
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:30:07 2015 UTC,C'mon Cabby. Sac fly pls.
tampabayrays,38qf35,mkultra3,3,Sat Jun 6 03:22:13 2015 UTC,We're gonna leave a man at 3rd... it's so damn painful!

tampabayrays,38qf35,mkultra3,3,Sat Jun 6 03:05:37 2015 UTC,Nice hustle souza
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,5,Sat Jun 6 02:41:16 2015 UTC,Was that splatoon sign there yesterday? Nintendo really marketing this right...
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,4,Sat Jun 6 02:39:52 2015 UTC,"You are a kid, but you are also, in fact, a squid."
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"Nice try. Lots of distance to cover, would have been impressive if he made that."
tampabayrays,38qf35,mkultra3,3,Sat Jun 6 02:25:46 2015 UTC,"Souza, you ain't no Kiermaier"
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 6 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or was that Double steal pointless, since we had someone in scoring position anyway?"
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 6 02:16:57 2015 UTC,Pretty much..
tampabayrays,38qf35,xiedian,3,Sat Jun 6 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"Ahh, great start :)"
tampabayrays,38qf35,mkultra3,4,Sat Jun 6 02:11:27 2015 UTC,Felix vs Colome tomorrow so we probably wanna win this if we want to take the series
tampabayrays,38qf35,colwell25,2,Sat Jun 6 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, Rameriz and co. held them to 1 run, and Colome is at least his equal... so we can still go for the sweep."
tampabayrays,38qf35,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"You never know, what with felix Givin up the booty in his last game"
tampabayrays,38qf35,C0LL0C0,7,Sat Jun 6 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"Hey guys stream is up and in HD right now  kylepmore.wix.com/rays  It also works on mobile!  I invited a few Yankees and Angels fans to come watch their game on the site but it looks like the Yanks will win this one. Rays will be on, on time."
tampabayrays,38qf35,Fuck_Your_Squirtle,2,Sat Jun 6 01:41:51 2015 UTC,You're back :D
tampabayrays,38pttv,TrenchcoatWarfare,2,Fri Jun 5 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the same thing... I usually buy via Ticketmaster but I wanna know if I could save a few bucks buying at the box office right before the White Sox game on the 12th. Those of you who have bought at the box office, do they charge the same BS ""service charge""-type fees as Ticketmaster?"
tampabayrays,38pttv,PinheadRecords,3,Fri Jun 5 22:53:54 2015 UTC,"They don't charge fees at all at Tropicana Field. The store in downtown Tampa charges like $1.50 a ticket, which is nothing compared to TM.   That said, in years past, they've upped the price by a few bucks a few hours before the game, so if you can buy them from the box office prior to that, I would."
tampabayrays,38pttv,millionaremattdavis,3,Sat Jun 6 03:36:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info!"
tampabayrays,38pttv,PinheadRecords,2,Sat Jun 6 04:21:17 2015 UTC,"In the past, I've been charged an extra fee for buying a ticket within three hours of game time. I don't know if it's the same this year, but I would imagine it would be."
tampabayrays,38pttv,chalupa_lover,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:02:54 2015 UTC,I'm actually looking at heading down on Saturday for a game and was wondering the same thing. Planning on getting cheap seats anyway but it'd be nice to know. I'll try this weekend and post back if no one else does.
tampabayrays,38pttv,survey____says,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"IMO GameTime sports app is the best bet. Tix generally go down to 5 or 6 bucks the day of game, and it delivers the tix right to your phone. Promo code SUPERBOOM1781 gets u ten free dollars to use on the app."
tampabayrays,38kiq2,USCswimmer,3,Thu Jun 4 20:32:24 2015 UTC,I love Uribe's face when he gets back to the dugout. He's in such disbelief.
tampabayrays,38kiq2,NosyargKcid,3,Fri Jun 5 02:46:06 2015 UTC,The amount of butt hurt from the Dodgers announcers is glorious.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,RaysBot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:10:16 2015 UTC,YES! Let's get a big win streak going
tampabayrays,38l9o2,dakoslug,3,Fri Jun 5 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"Nice win here, hopefully we can win this series, that would be 3 series wins in a row."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 05:02:19 2015 UTC,Would also be a big step towards getting back to 90 win expectation.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Fri Jun 5 05:03:00 2015 UTC,Are we actually winning games on the west coast!!!!
tampabayrays,38l9o2,CaptZBrannigan,3,Fri Jun 5 05:00:53 2015 UTC,"fun mariners fact, score 4+ runs and you have an automatic win! If youre gonna beat us at least beat the fucking yankees in your divison please"

tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"Damn bunt. At least we executed and got the out. We need to get that runner, unless Jepsen can get a strikeout."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Fri Jun 5 04:48:05 2015 UTC,Cmon man...
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 04:46:41 2015 UTC,Seriously?
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 04:45:15 2015 UTC,Jepsen's in... all he needs is 3 outs.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Fri Jun 5 04:43:55 2015 UTC,Jepsen!
tampabayrays,38l9o2,colwell25,5,Fri Jun 5 04:43:47 2015 UTC,Jepsen.. idk how I feel about this
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 04:43:27 2015 UTC,I don't get it either
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,4,Fri Jun 5 04:45:23 2015 UTC,It's Souza time! BRING LONGO HOME!
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for his homeruns, he would be one if not the worst bat in outer lineup, with all his ks"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 04:44:27 2015 UTC,"true, but it's nice to have Someone who can swing it other than Longo, and as it was said earlier, Longo's not even having his best year."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Fri Jun 5 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"Souza, the strikeout king."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,YouEnjoyMyself84,5,Fri Jun 5 04:44:18 2015 UTC,"Forsythe is 0-2, but he has a run, SB, HBP, still finding a way to impact the game"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 04:38:07 2015 UTC,"He's a beast, without him we would be screwed."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,4,Fri Jun 5 04:43:01 2015 UTC,"De Jesús dosent just strike out and walk away he strikeouts, pirouette's, high butterfly kicks, two steps,then walks away"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,5,Fri Jun 5 04:36:44 2015 UTC,Good Double for Longo!
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,7,Fri Jun 5 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, these threads are pretty busy. I remember a few years ago making them every day and it was just a few of us here. Great to see some love now!"

tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"""Pyrotechnics""... I don't know, that sounds cooler than ""Fireworks."""
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 04:27:32 2015 UTC,Either way it's better than the Jackson 5 and Cody simpson lol
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 04:34:27 2015 UTC,Will they use mcgee for the 8th? They should let him close imo
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 04:21:08 2015 UTC,Seager and Smith due so it makes sense to put the leftie in
tampabayrays,38l9o2,colwell25,3,Fri Jun 5 04:23:04 2015 UTC,I'd hope they try letting him stay out for the two-inning save.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 04:26:25 2015 UTC,"He'll yea that would be great for the rays, and my fantasy team =O"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,5,Fri Jun 5 04:27:53 2015 UTC,Nice play Forsythe

tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Fri Jun 5 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"It is NOT ok that longoria is batting 260, with 25 rbi and 5 homeruns one third through the season."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,4,Fri Jun 5 03:58:36 2015 UTC,"Damn, I just realized we're that much into the season, and he's not showing ANY power, I don't get it, the man is in his prime right now.."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"Which is why I wonder what's really going on, is he injured and just not telling anyone?"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,6,Fri Jun 5 04:16:07 2015 UTC,"I'm still a little new at this, but those numbers look pretty low for Longo standards."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Fri Jun 5 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"That's an understatement, he's usually a consistent 30HR-90RBI type hitter , but he's not producing very much. Good thing guys like Souza and Forsythe are picking that production back up"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,4,Fri Jun 5 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"Damn lebron, he dissappeared in overtime, oh well golden state wins game 1"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,4,Fri Jun 5 03:57:31 2015 UTC,Sweet pitch by Gomes
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:56:34 2015 UTC,Damn Splatoon ads... I don't see why everyone is up-in-arms about it.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"We love our wiiu, can't wait to buy it"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,3,Fri Jun 5 03:56:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a Nintendo Fanboy all the way, but Splatoon doesn't interest me personally... yet again, I've hated every Pokemon game since Gen 3, and everyone says they're getting better, so I'm probably just the only sane man left on Earth weird.  The last Mariners game when we played 'Gormet Race' from Smash Bros was a cool fact to pick up on..."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Fri Jun 5 04:01:35 2015 UTC,Splatoon is dope bro.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,FuriousTarts,3,Fri Jun 5 04:59:05 2015 UTC,"Huge nintendo fan as well, have you given splatoon a try? Its actually a lot of fun and Yea they play a smash bros clip on the big screen while the opposing team is converging on the mound, they've been doing it for years, Fun fact: nintendo owns part of the mariners."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,C0LL0C0,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:10:06 2015 UTC,"Alright, let him get the first strike out, he looked pretty good on that one, he might have been able to go a little longer."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:46:25 2015 UTC,"Damnit Bulter, double play! you're better than that."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Fri Jun 5 03:40:19 2015 UTC,Erasmo's done well to pitch out of that
tampabayrays,38l9o2,colwell25,3,Fri Jun 5 03:34:38 2015 UTC,NBA Finals are going to OT for the first game.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:34:35 2015 UTC,Huge pick off!
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 03:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a good play, but he had to get that final strike and he didn't... Ramirez is certainly capable of finishing this without any further damage, he just needs to do it."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"Let him finish the Inning, then get someone else out there."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:30:02 2015 UTC,Was that a 3 pitch inning? Damn Offense.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:22:31 2015 UTC,Ramirez on point after that leadoff double
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 03:17:57 2015 UTC,"Like this one... Pull it together, and get your head out of your ass Ramirez!"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, glad he pulled things together. He's a good pitcher, he just shits the bed in some innings here and there."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"0-2 and of course Ramirez gives up a double... oh well, beats not having a 5th pitcher at all."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:12:28 2015 UTC,He's been great today. I can't even compare this version to the one that came to the Rays at the beginning of the year. No longer cutting the edge of the zone. Attacking and has command. I have no idea what adjustments they made with him but he's a different guy.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,mkultra3,3,Fri Jun 5 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, his last outing was really really good, no runs and 7Ks. I have faith in him"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,xiedian,3,Fri Jun 5 03:14:50 2015 UTC,I mean... I'll take him over any of the Blue Jays/Red Sox Pitchers... but we've got 4 guys clearly better than him...
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Fri Jun 5 03:16:49 2015 UTC,At this point is take Ramirez over Colome.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,mkultra3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Moore coming back later this/early next month, and he's really the only Left handed Arm we have outside Cedeno... someone might go for some Lefty Bullpen help."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"Wait a second... Colome and Ramirez are both RH. Not sure the point you're trying to make here.   I think what happens is that Moore comes back and shifts Colome to the pen, knocking out Bellatti. Cedeno is our one true LOOGY for sure, but we do have McGee that Cash said he'll use for high leverage LHP (though he can get everyone out)."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,mkultra3,2,Fri Jun 5 11:32:33 2015 UTC,"No, I know both are Righties, that's why I was thinking one of them could be traded."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:24:49 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, ok, I didnt understand if you wanted them in the pen or be traded.   I'm not sure it's in the team philosophy to trade assets, and I dont think the Rays would have given up a lefty in Montgomery if they were going to turn around and trade either SP for a lefty bullpen arm. C.J. Riefenhauser is also down in Durham, back from injury, if we do need him. Still, I dont think we really need another LHP. It might make sense to put either Colome or Ramirez in the pen as the long guy (which is why Frieri was DFA among other things, the team needed a guy with length and Frieri was a 1-inning guy, so they filled that spot with Bellatti).   If a deal does come up where they get a lot back (if they see either as a good SP), then I'd say the Rays could make a deal, but that's only if the right offer presents itself. I dont think the Rays will try to force anything since they are quite valuable to have, especially with all these injuries that could pop up."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,mkultra3,4,Fri Jun 5 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"oh no, we've been caught"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,FuriousTarts,3,Fri Jun 5 03:09:04 2015 UTC,Third Stolen base of the inning!  EDIT: Nope...
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Fri Jun 5 03:07:29 2015 UTC,Hustle hard to first and good things happen - that's a big run
tampabayrays,38l9o2,colwell25,6,Fri Jun 5 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"Nice RBI Souza! You've got the swing, just get the contact more often!"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Fri Jun 5 03:03:41 2015 UTC,Good bit of hitting
tampabayrays,38l9o2,colwell25,5,Fri Jun 5 03:03:37 2015 UTC,Woot woot. Souza making contact and runs! He's from Seattle as well so making his fam happy!
tampabayrays,38l9o2,mkultra3,4,Fri Jun 5 03:03:37 2015 UTC,Nicee Souza

tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Fri Jun 5 03:02:03 2015 UTC,"I've been really looking forward to Mahtook's debut (I know this isn't, but this appears to be a longer stay), hopefully we can see that bat come alive soon."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,FuriousTarts,2,Fri Jun 5 02:57:16 2015 UTC,"Who the Hell is Matook, why isn't Kiermeyer playing, and was that a hell of a catch or what?"
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Fri Jun 5 02:56:01 2015 UTC,They want a RH bat to face these lefty pitchers. This is the third one in a row. KK has really struggled vs LHP this year.
tampabayrays,38l9o2,mkultra3,3,Fri Jun 5 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool, as long as it's not an Injury... he got the HR yesterday, I think it was against RHP."
tampabayrays,38l9o2,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Fri Jun 5 03:06:04 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you can have the worst offense in the AL when you have Nelson Cruz (and Cano).  Imagine if we had Nelson Cruz.

tampabayrays,38fvjo,zeitfalle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:26:38 2015 UTC,I DONT LIKE THIS. Joyce always has that power threat.... but also DP and SO threat :P
tampabayrays,38fvjo,botts,2,Thu Jun 4 05:25:52 2015 UTC,"More excellent management from Cash btw. Let Cedeno get the lefty Calhoun, but if we left him in til Joyce they'd go for a pinch hitter but we'd rather have Geltz v Joyce at the moment"
tampabayrays,38fvjo,colwell25,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:20:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, it was likely Geltz vs. Joyce or Xedeno vs. Freese."
tampabayrays,38fvjo,zeitfalle,3,Thu Jun 4 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"Welp, its Geltz for Freese and Joyce."
tampabayrays,38fvjo,zeitfalle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:20:10 2015 UTC,I guess its Cedeno until they PH for Joyce.

tampabayrays,38budj,harryhotdog,9,Wed Jun 3 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"Is it fair to say he's the early Cy Young favorite at this point? Has to be top 5, right?"
tampabayrays,38budj,jmk1991,3,Wed Jun 3 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"It's between him, Dallas Keuchel, Sonny Gray, and Felix Hernandez."
tampabayrays,38budj,usabfb,2,Wed Jun 3 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"Too early, but hes on track.    Its crazy to me how great Keuchel has been after his first couple of shitty years."
tampabayrays,38budj,zeitfalle,6,Thu Jun 4 02:28:52 2015 UTC,He's a boss ass bitch
tampabayrays,38budj,Chaddcl0ps,3,Wed Jun 3 13:54:28 2015 UTC,I'm sad that he didn't get the complete game and have the chance for the team record.

tampabayrays,3857z2,Krapul,2,Mon Jun 1 23:20:06 2015 UTC,I disapprove!
tampabayrays,381emg,griph00k,7,Mon Jun 1 03:41:30 2015 UTC,"Very unclear. He's had lingering injuries throught his entire career and many of those times it's very unclear how he's progressing and sometimes his diagnosis are vague. This time around, he has knee bursitis. If I were to take a stab at it from afar, I would say that some of the reasons you drafted him (SB) should be going out the window. PLus, he's never been much of an average guy either. It's your decision whether to drop him or not depending on the quality of the waiver pool, but I wouldn't expect him to be anything more than what he was last year, and maybe even less production than that."
tampabayrays,381emg,mkultra3,2,Mon Jun 1 15:57:26 2015 UTC,"Jennings was the guy coming up who was going to 'grow into his power.' Always had great plate discipline in the minors, so we figured we were in for a .350+ OBP .400+ SLG kinda guy. Didn't end up working out that way.     He's not an ideal fantasy player because he doesn't have particularly pronounced splits (he hits better against lefties, but he doesn't crush them when compared to other RH platoon options) and most of his value is going to come from his glove. If he got on base more, he may be a stealing threat, but thus far in his career, he hasn't shown the ability to pick his spots even when he does get on.    Depends on how many players are in your league. Trade him if you can. Maybe you can get a middle level sort of prospect."
tampabayrays,381emg,zeitfalle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:40:17 2015 UTC,"thank you for this detailed response. I inherited a team that was abandoned in a friend of a friend's AL only (10 team) league. He seemed like a good guy to hold on to ( i was responsible for turning over about 40% of the roster) keep 16/30 players on roster, but ya I see your point. Not a ton on the waiver wire, but will keep my eyes open. Brock holt is available, been eyeing him."
tampabayrays,381emg,zeitfalle,3,Tue Jun 2 03:46:17 2015 UTC,Joey Gallo should come available really soon. Would be a worthwhile pickup.
tampabayrays,381emg,zeitfalle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:36:01 2015 UTC,unfortunately I'm in an AL only dynasty league so most prospects are accounted for. Any deep sleepers for AL pitchers in AA or AAA that aren't on all of the usual prospect lists?
tampabayrays,37yma6,RaysBot,5,Sun May 31 14:35:12 2015 UTC,Back in first
tampabayrays,37yma6,one80oneday,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"This division is like the south div in NFL, with the bucs and saints."
tampabayrays,37yma6,twoscoop,2,Sun May 31 23:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yanks lose! Back in first! (well, tie...)"
tampabayrays,37yma6,botts,5,Sun May 31 22:29:41 2015 UTC,"we won one today, that's two in a row!"
tampabayrays,37yma6,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sun May 31 21:01:42 2015 UTC,Ballgame! Big series win!
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,3,Sun May 31 21:01:25 2015 UTC,Good game rays!
tampabayrays,37yma6,DylanRamsey,2,Sun May 31 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"These fouls, wowee"
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,0,Sun May 31 20:59:54 2015 UTC,Cedeno = 💩
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,3,Sun May 31 20:54:22 2015 UTC,Sac fly a decent outcome there. Make this a 4 run game and (as much as I want to see him) give Boxy the day off
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,5,Sun May 31 20:19:32 2015 UTC,I'm loving all of this offensive today
tampabayrays,37yma6,DylanRamsey,5,Sun May 31 20:18:05 2015 UTC,Wow all Joey does is hit hit hit hit.
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,6,Sun May 31 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"Four hits for Butler, my word"
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,3,Sun May 31 20:16:30 2015 UTC,Don't do em like that Joey
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,6,Sun May 31 20:16:22 2015 UTC,I think if Delmon Young had hit his 3rd homer against us we should just forfeit out of embarrassment
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,3,Sun May 31 20:03:50 2015 UTC,Thank god. Getting a little worried Young would go 3 bombs today
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,6,Sun May 31 20:03:40 2015 UTC,Jesus Delmon. Give me a heart attack
tampabayrays,37yma6,botts,3,Sun May 31 20:03:26 2015 UTC,At least Boxy can get the save now :-/
tampabayrays,37yma6,botts,3,Sun May 31 20:02:12 2015 UTC,I swear if we find a way to blow this lead..
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,5,Sun May 31 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"Franklin really shouldn't have a place on this roster with Beckham and Elmore here, and doing so much better"
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,7,Sun May 31 19:49:18 2015 UTC,David DeJesus worth every penny
tampabayrays,37yma6,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sun May 31 19:42:35 2015 UTC,The Holy One!
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,2,Sun May 31 19:41:58 2015 UTC,Nasty pitch. Sometimes you just have to tip your cap.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,3,Sun May 31 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"Oliver Drake, that's a badass name"
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,3,Sun May 31 19:30:51 2015 UTC,Based Butler having an amazing series so far
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,3,Sun May 31 19:29:31 2015 UTC,Man that strikeout pitch was the same one that Delmon walked on #justsayin
tampabayrays,37yma6,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sun May 31 19:28:15 2015 UTC,Phew.
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,4,Sun May 31 19:23:28 2015 UTC,Yep. Hot damn I thought he was going to blow the lead.
tampabayrays,37yma6,lazybrouf,7,Sun May 31 19:24:25 2015 UTC,Don't think Jake wanted anything to do with Delmon
tampabayrays,37yma6,JoebobZanzibar,5,Sun May 31 19:19:33 2015 UTC,I don't think Jake wants anything to do with the strike zone.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,4,Sun May 31 19:21:26 2015 UTC,Dang Franklin has been awful since coming back.
tampabayrays,37yma6,CooperEarly,2,Sun May 31 19:11:50 2015 UTC,Franklin has looked completely overmatched since coming off the DL.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,8,Sun May 31 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"Souza might strike out a ton and not make a whole lotta contact, but when he does....it's goneeee!"
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,3,Sun May 31 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"He's got all the tools, just needs to find a way to put them together"
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,4,Sun May 31 19:08:26 2015 UTC,Boooom!
tampabayrays,37yma6,Krapul,5,Sun May 31 19:05:38 2015 UTC,Is Souza now to the O's what Steve Pearce is to us?
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,6,Sun May 31 19:05:38 2015 UTC,Niceeee Souza!!
tampabayrays,37yma6,DylanRamsey,6,Sun May 31 19:05:28 2015 UTC,Ayyyy Souza finally coming around lately!
tampabayrays,37yma6,botts,4,Sun May 31 19:05:27 2015 UTC,BOOOOOOOM! SOUZAAAAA
tampabayrays,37yma6,JoebobZanzibar,5,Sun May 31 19:05:11 2015 UTC,Souza have my babies
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,4,Sun May 31 19:05:08 2015 UTC,SOOOOUUUUZAAAAAAAA
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,5,Sun May 31 19:05:04 2015 UTC,YES!
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,6,Sun May 31 19:05:03 2015 UTC,Forsythe have my babies.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,3,Sun May 31 19:02:03 2015 UTC,Let's go lumberjack!
tampabayrays,37yma6,colwell25,6,Sun May 31 19:02:03 2015 UTC,Yeeees
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,4,Sun May 31 19:01:41 2015 UTC,Uh oh. If Tillman is on now we're in trouble.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,3,Sun May 31 18:58:26 2015 UTC,I'd like to think I jinxed him.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,6,Sun May 31 19:07:20 2015 UTC,Kiermaier have my babies
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,5,Sun May 31 18:52:19 2015 UTC,God this team is epic bad if they have someone on base.
tampabayrays,37yma6,lazybrouf,5,Sun May 31 18:52:15 2015 UTC,Another wasted opportunity? Such is the way of the Rays
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,7,Sun May 31 18:46:48 2015 UTC,A hit with RISP? Not the Rays Way.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,4,Sun May 31 18:45:50 2015 UTC,This is turning into a clinic in how to waste leadoff doubles!
tampabayrays,37yma6,Krapul,4,Sun May 31 18:44:34 2015 UTC,Haha Shout-out to the european viewers! <3
tampabayrays,37yma6,Krapul,3,Sun May 31 18:40:09 2015 UTC,The day games are the only ones we can watch.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,2,Sun May 31 18:47:05 2015 UTC,Are you the guy from Spain?
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,2,Sun May 31 18:53:04 2015 UTC,They didn't even mention Belgium! I'm in shock! I feel neglected!
tampabayrays,37yma6,Krapul,1 point,Sun May 31 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, Belgium is way better than Spain and probably even further away!  You should email in!"
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,3,Sun May 31 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, Scotland."
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,3,Sun May 31 19:00:45 2015 UTC,Whats up with all these leadoff doubles?
tampabayrays,37yma6,Krapul,4,Sun May 31 18:39:18 2015 UTC,What is going on? I am at work and don't know what everyone is freaking out about.
tampabayrays,37yma6,underclass4,3,Sun May 31 18:33:44 2015 UTC,Delmon Young happened. He just tagged your pitcher for a round-tripper. Yes. Another shot from him.
tampabayrays,37yma6,aresef,2,Sun May 31 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"lol giving up 2 HR to Delmon Young is really, really, really pathetic."
tampabayrays,37yma6,YouGoGlennnCoCo,2,Sun May 31 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"Gahhh, Delmon..."
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,3,Sun May 31 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"Where was that when you played for us, Delmon?"
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,2,Sun May 31 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"For what its worth, our stadium isn't necessarily a hitters' ballpark"
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,3,Sun May 31 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Odo can keep us on top, that inning was huge in terms of padding the lead  Edit: I said it here first.."
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,5,Sun May 31 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"He looks safe to me. If this ""clear and convincing"" thing prevents them to overturn the call, that's utter bullshit.  Edit: Bullshit. I hope Cash unloads again vs the Umps in his post game interview."
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,2,Sun May 31 18:27:21 2015 UTC,r/conspiracy
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,3,Sun May 31 18:29:02 2015 UTC,TBH Rays sliding technique has not been great this season
tampabayrays,37yma6,JoebobZanzibar,2,Sun May 31 18:26:53 2015 UTC,Huhhh? Came off the baggggg??
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,2,Sun May 31 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"To me, it looked like he kept his foot in the same position after the attempted tag and he didn't even try to move it back, it was obvious he wasn't even touching it"
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,1 point,Sun May 31 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"Ah crap, I think you're right after second viewing."
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,2,Sun May 31 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when you first watch the play it looks like dejesus definitely got in there, but up close its pretty clear the foot was off the bag sadly"
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,2,Sun May 31 18:31:49 2015 UTC,What just happened..
tampabayrays,37yma6,xiedian,2,Sun May 31 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"Man, Joey Butler has outperformed DJ in every way when he was on the field. Reallllly going to be hard when he has to come back."
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,2,Sun May 31 18:22:27 2015 UTC,Offense!
tampabayrays,37yma6,Krapul,3,Sun May 31 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yay! Wow, nice way to take the lead!"
tampabayrays,37yma6,mkultra3,3,Sun May 31 18:07:15 2015 UTC,That slide by Franklin though. Ugh.
tampabayrays,37yma6,kingfishcoons,1 point,Sun May 31 18:11:17 2015 UTC,If he would have just swiped the outside corner of the plate it wouldn't have even been close...
tampabayrays,37yma6,CooperEarly,3,Sun May 31 18:24:05 2015 UTC,Wow great hustle by Forsythe for that bloop double
tampabayrays,37yma6,CooperEarly,-4,Sun May 31 17:58:20 2015 UTC,Odorizzo wasting no time before shitting this game up.

tampabayrays,37v0yw,RaysBot,1 point,Sat May 30 17:05:06 2015 UTC,Woo! Didn't get to watch today but nice to see we finally broke the losing streak. Let's make up for it with a winning stream.

tampabayrays,37v0yw,mkultra3,2,Sat May 30 22:18:36 2015 UTC,.500 baby!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 22:18:28 2015 UTC,Defense dominated the last two outs. What a fun game to watch. Thanks for having me here
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,2,Sat May 30 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"Boxberger back in the saddle, hell yea."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 30 22:17:10 2015 UTC,WHOA! What a play
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 30 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"haha nifty play to end it, GG"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,2,Sat May 30 22:16:49 2015 UTC,Nice play Elmo!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,5,Sat May 30 22:16:43 2015 UTC,That was REALLY solid defense by Elmore
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,6,Sat May 30 22:16:31 2015 UTC,He was doing his best Ben Bishop impression with that save  lol
tampabayrays,37v0yw,CooperEarly,2,Sat May 30 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"Alright alright, this is going well"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 22:16:11 2015 UTC,GOT EEEEEEEEEEEMMM
tampabayrays,37v0yw,CooperEarly,3,Sat May 30 22:15:14 2015 UTC,This has been incredibly quick. Barely 2 hours for this game and we're at the bottom of the ninth
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,2,Sat May 30 22:12:50 2015 UTC,"Aiite Boxey, no HRs today. Pls."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,mkultra3,2,Sat May 30 22:11:22 2015 UTC,It'll be interesting to see who they bring out in the 9th with all the late game bed shitting that has been going on lately.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,CooperEarly,2,Sat May 30 22:10:30 2015 UTC,Not getting the luck today in so many ways.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 30 22:04:45 2015 UTC,Gomes gettin' lefties out.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 30 22:01:30 2015 UTC,Fuck. That was harsh.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 30 21:54:16 2015 UTC,how the fuck did Roe get out of that
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,2,Sat May 30 21:54:13 2015 UTC,WOW :(
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,1 point,Sat May 30 21:54:04 2015 UTC,Come on Longo... Can't go down like that with the bases loaded
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,2,Sat May 30 21:52:43 2015 UTC,gotta cash in here
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 30 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"Perfect bunt. Thought it was silly to bring him in for a bunt, but I guess I was wrong."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,3,Sat May 30 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"OK Rays, bases loaded no outs!"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 21:51:28 2015 UTC,Erasmo getting it done today!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,NosyargKcid,3,Sat May 30 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"I've been watching here and there this game; Eraser looks great today. 3 hits, 1 walk!? Wow. Also glad to see Souza with 0 strikeouts as well."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,mkultra3,3,Sat May 30 21:43:47 2015 UTC,"The defense has been pretty strong today, too. Definitely helps when both the pitcher and defense are both playing at a high level"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,4,Sat May 30 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"Glad they found a way to get Forsythe back at 2nd, plus Cabby playing SS (though he looks just as lost at the plate as ever). That strikeout in the 9th last night was infuritating."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,mkultra3,3,Sat May 30 21:47:31 2015 UTC,"that was great to watch, impressive 7th"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,1 point,Sat May 30 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest: I've never been fond of Erasmo Ramirez, but today definitely changed my perception of him. He is straight beasting this game"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,2,Sat May 30 21:42:07 2015 UTC,uhoh Beckham's day is done
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"Damn, nice play by Chen. Great throw."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 21:34:07 2015 UTC,Gotta be the best 6 innings Erasmo's pitched this year?
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,4,Sat May 30 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"Hes at like 75 pitches too...and its the fuckin Os, they have a good lineup"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 21:32:45 2015 UTC,Who is this pitcher and what has he done with Erasmo?
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 30 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Did Machado just scream ""FUCK"" ?"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 30 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"At least the count will get reset. Looked out to me though, wouldn't challenge that"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,3,Sat May 30 21:25:53 2015 UTC,"Count reset for Jake Elmore! Who, is somehow hitting the ball this year."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 30 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, he's toast."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 21:25:53 2015 UTC,I'm way too happy about Souza taking a walk.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 30 21:24:54 2015 UTC,Might have gotten away with that walk
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,1 point,Sat May 30 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Walks have been scarce today
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,3,Sat May 30 21:23:56 2015 UTC,Joey Butler's arm!!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,colwell25,3,Sat May 30 21:17:08 2015 UTC,Clutch defense
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,3,Sat May 30 21:16:36 2015 UTC,OH YEA HES OUT NO RUNS FOR YOUUUUU
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 21:16:16 2015 UTC,Runners on 2nd and 3rd is basically Boss Mode for the Rays RPG
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,1 point,Sat May 30 21:08:34 2015 UTC,Nice job Guyer!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,5,Sat May 30 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"Yayyyy, more injuries"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,colwell25,3,Sat May 30 21:05:07 2015 UTC,Oh no plz no more injuries Mr Beckham
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 21:03:15 2015 UTC,Don't wanna jinx anything but wowee Erasmo is pitching well
tampabayrays,37v0yw,colwell25,4,Sat May 30 20:58:31 2015 UTC,Just interesting to think back to last season and that massive slump Forsythe had and now seeing him in the cleanup spot and having a lot of success. Glad he's turned it around.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,4,Sat May 30 20:49:56 2015 UTC,He's really filled in for Zobrist as our consistent hitter.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,4,Sat May 30 20:55:39 2015 UTC,Joey Butler has been doing awesome since he got called up. Hope he can stay around even when Jennings comes back. Possibly as our primary DH
tampabayrays,37v0yw,CooperEarly,3,Sat May 30 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, that didn't even click that Joey Butler was once ours. Glad to see him doing well"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,4,Sat May 30 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"Always knew going into this season we were going to need some big years from random players, hopefully Butler can keep his hitting up."
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,5,Sat May 30 20:39:22 2015 UTC,We're up to I believe 14 rookies used this year. Would be nice to get some offense from within the system!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 20:43:52 2015 UTC,Where the hell was this offense last night?
tampabayrays,37v0yw,CooperEarly,2,Sat May 30 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"Sweet, ding dong goodbye ball"
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,2,Sat May 30 20:38:34 2015 UTC,Joey Butler!
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 20:38:29 2015 UTC,Robbed! Damn. Guyer smoked that one.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 20:37:39 2015 UTC,Souz! Tuning in late and we already have 2 runs.
tampabayrays,37v0yw,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 30 20:31:23 2015 UTC,What was that paper that Guyer pulled out?
tampabayrays,37v0yw,rps215,4,Sat May 30 20:30:31 2015 UTC,Didn't see what you're referring to but CF isn't Guyer's typical position so it could be a positioning cheat sheet?
tampabayrays,37v0yw,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 30 20:33:02 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. It was right after that deep fly ball for the 2nd out of the 2nd.

tampabayrays,37rffx,lolyou22,4,Sat May 30 01:31:19 2015 UTC,Why the hell Cabrera wasn't pinch hit for? That's fucking messed up.
tampabayrays,37rffx,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat May 30 01:33:57 2015 UTC,At least he didn't strike out.

tampabayrays,37hxdw,sveitthrone,10,Wed May 27 19:36:19 2015 UTC,"ive said this before, but so far, the biggest obstacle has been sternberg. He gave a bullshit deal to the St Pete council that said we would be able to leave and he also would get a fraction of the profit after they sold the property to developers. The rays would get no penalty for leaving a stadium that was given to them and didnt have to pay taxes on.  hey why dont we play in the bucs stadium?"
tampabayrays,37hxdw,haflac,4,Wed May 27 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"The Rays have abandoned that part of the deal and re-offered it to St Pete. As it stands right now, the Rays don't get anything out of the sale/redevelopment of the Trop property, so Sternberg really isn't the obstacle.   Here are your obstacles...the people who may ultimately doom baseball in Tampa Bay....  http://www.stpete.org/council/district_2.php  http://www.stpete.org/council/district_7.php  http://www.stpete.org/council/district_8.php  http://www.stpete.org/council/district_5.php  http://www.stpete.org/council/district_3.php"
tampabayrays,37hxdw,TheCenterOfEnnui,4,Wed May 27 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"Yep! Really thought we were over the hump with Foster out, but looks like these folks are getting paid off by MTL to send them a team."
tampabayrays,37hxdw,zbrasseur1,6,Wed May 27 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I've said it again-due to traffic alone, downtown Tampa is not a good location. Neither is downtown St. Pete for that matter. The Gateway area of St. Pete is ideal. Coming from Hillsborough it's right off the bridge. Within Pinellas obviously there are plenty of ways to get there. Plus, there's open land that can be used without having to tear anything down."
tampabayrays,37hxdw,Dirtydirtdirtt,3,Thu May 28 04:39:54 2015 UTC,"You're still asking most Tampa fans to drive through downtown during rush hour to cross a bridge and get to games. You might see more fans from South Tampa or Town N Country showing up, but I don't think it'd be a big enough draw to sustain the team."
tampabayrays,37hxdw,tb_rays77,2,Thu May 28 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think Feather sound would be a good area, but traffic on Ulmertan is already terrible enough."
tampabayrays,37hxdw,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu May 28 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, the Ybor city area is ideal! It's got great views of downtown, it's got bars/restaurants to pregame, and there is already parking in the area. Close enough for the people in Brandon/south bay to make it, Orlando isn't as far away so we could draw from there, and most importantly, the wesley chapel/new tampa areas are not that far.   Fairgrounds would be a good site too if all else failed, but I hate the idea of having another isolated stadium with no restaurants/bars in walking distance.   Could someone please explain to me why the Rays don't just tell St Pete to fuck off and look in Tampa on their own?"
tampabayrays,37hxdw,zbrasseur1,2,Sun May 31 06:45:12 2015 UTC,Could someone please explain to me why the Rays don't just tell St Pete to fuck off and look in Tampa on their own?   Lawsuits would come fast and furious.
tampabayrays,37hxdw,chalupa_lover,2,Sun May 31 19:14:22 2015 UTC,What /u/millionaremattdavis said. The Rays really don't want to get involved in a lawsuit that could also spark conflict between Tampa and St. Pete. There needs to be a community wide effort made in resolving this. Unfortunately the St. Pete city council doesn't seem to understand the consequences.
tampabayrays,37hxdw,Lauxman,3,Tue Jun 2 03:38:54 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but this area just isn't built for a baseball team. Traffic is an absolute nightmare with the Bucs and the Lightning. Adding the Rays to the mix wouldn't help at all, especially with how many games they play and the time of day it would generate traffic. Until Tampa can get a real public transportation system, a new stadium would be a failure."
tampabayrays,37hxdw,millionaremattdavis,3,Thu May 28 13:36:06 2015 UTC,It's Florida and we keep electing Republicans. We will never have public transportation used by anybody but homeless people.
tampabayrays,37hxdw,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Fri May 29 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Is financing really even the problem though? We can't even get permission to look at other sites outside of St. Petersburg. When has actually talking about paying for the stadium been a roadblock?
tampabayrays,37gmjd,RaysBot,3,Wed May 27 14:10:18 2015 UTC,Archer is something special. You guys have a great talent down there. I am not excited to see him again in 10 games. Ugh.
tampabayrays,37gmjd,McLovin1019,1 point,Wed May 27 22:28:28 2015 UTC,"He's got great stuff and a great attitude, but we're very, veryyy luck that he's not even our best pitchers. Matt Moore has the highest celing, and one would argue that Smyly and Cobb are on the level of Archie. All very different as well, which make games extremely fun to watch.   Man, the 2015 that could have been...Cobb, Smyly, Archer, Moore, Odorizzi."
tampabayrays,37gmjd,mkultra3,5,Thu May 28 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"Sad, what a wasted effort by Arch.  12 K's !"

tampabayrays,37gmjd,JoebobZanzibar,3,Wed May 27 19:14:01 2015 UTC,wow what is going on with Box
tampabayrays,37gmjd,colwell25,13,Wed May 27 19:12:19 2015 UTC,Two absolutely brilliant pitching performances tonight. Arch truly going toe to toe with one of baseball's greats
tampabayrays,37gmjd,zeitfalle,8,Wed May 27 19:05:57 2015 UTC,Archer game score at 90. Hell of a game.
tampabayrays,37gmjd,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Wed May 27 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"If we can score here, Archer's going the distance!"
tampabayrays,37gmjd,JoebobZanzibar,3,Wed May 27 18:58:23 2015 UTC,"Archer looks gassed, Box is warming up, and I think this one has extra innings written all over it."

tampabayrays,37gmjd,mkultra3,3,Wed May 27 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"Well, Root sports (the Seattle broadcast) will be showing it so you should be fine. I'm going to overlay the Rays Radio broadcast on the Seattle broadcast if I can.   Yeah, Sun Sports decides which games they broadcast at the beginning of the season and dont do all 81 home games. A Wednesday afternoon game before the summer is probably one of those games they'd drop."

tampabayrays,37dbmq,C0LL0C0,3,Wed May 27 03:12:21 2015 UTC,Ugh. Well it was still fun to watch and they fought till the end. Sucks to see McGee and boxy give up home runs on the same night but I hope that's a one time thing. Up and at em tomorrow.

tampabayrays,37dbmq,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Tue May 26 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"Some interesting pre-game tidbits: Franklin is taking grounders at LF today. It would make sense to give him a little more versatility if Forsythe emerges as the everyday 2B (when Loney is healthy of course). Even better; DeJesus is taking reps at 1B.  I guess they'll try to plug in guys everywhere to alleviate some of these injury holes.  However, I hope they can do this and play plus defense -- the defensive misplays have been disappointing and have led to some of these losses this past week."
tampabayrays,37a5up,tsxboy,11,Tue May 26 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"The drive can be pretty terrible depending on where you're coming from and what day it is. My drive consists of going through downtown Tampa around rush hour to get to the bottleneck that is I-275 leaving Tampa (goes from 4 lanes to 2). Then cross the bridge and go through the entirety of St. Petersburg and face whatever traffic is there. Access from the actual interstate is great, but it's the getting there that can be a pain for a lot of Tampa residents. Now imagine someone who lives north or east of Tampa. If I'm leaving at 5:30..... And God forbid there's an accident on the bridge coming back. It'll make you wish you were in rush hour traffic.   As for ownership forcing out of the lease....its pretty ironclad. The City of St. Petersburg hasn't exactly been helpful on the issue either. They recently shot down a memo of understanding that would have allowed the Rays to look outside St. Pete for stadium sites.  That all said, the longer this situation goes on, the more it favors the Rays as St. Pete has less leverage each and every year that ticks off that ridiculous 30 year lease that was signed in the 90s."
tampabayrays,37a5up,millionaremattdavis,9,Tue May 26 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"St. Pete resident here.  It's nice having the Trop in my backyard, but I and many others know that if we want the Rays to stick around Tampa Bay, they need to move to Tampa. I love DTSP, but let's face it: Our high-rises are all condos, and Tampa's are all office buildings. St. Pete is not much more than a very large residential suburb of Tampa.  IMO, the Rays should buy up land directly beside Amalie Arena and build a nice, plush, 25-35k seat venue. Something we could easily fill all the time, and nice enough to draw fans to the park and away from their TVs. Maybe something on the waterfront, a la AT&T where the Giants play? Would be cool to see SUP boarders paddling after homers!  Just some thoughts."
tampabayrays,37a5up,InmanDO,3,Tue May 26 07:34:40 2015 UTC,I would love to have a stadium on the water. But to kind of crush your dreams there is no way it won't be a retractable roof. And with the amount of rain we get it will be closed 90% of the time. I went to both Miami/Rays games this year and the roof and back wall were both closed because there was like a 10% chance of rain.
tampabayrays,37a5up,EvelandsRule,3,Tue May 26 15:37:27 2015 UTC,I think Miami keeps their roof closed due to heat more than they do because of rain. At least that's my understanding.
tampabayrays,37a5up,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Tue May 26 16:09:06 2015 UTC,Wasn't there talk of using a tarp-like canopy recently?
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,1 point,Tue May 26 19:17:14 2015 UTC,In Miami? Not that I've heard. I don't know all the logistics behind it. I also don't understand why they just can't keep it open and close it when it starts to rain. Could just be that it's expensive and they don't want to waste the money.
tampabayrays,37a5up,EvelandsRule,2,Tue May 26 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant in Tampa or St Pete. I know the new ballpark was supposed to have a canopy of some kind."
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,1 point,Tue May 26 19:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was the original stadium design proposed in 2007 that would have been built where Al Lang is.  Nobody has spoken of it since the project was abandoned so who knows what kind of cover a potential park would have. Probably would depend on the location. I can't see a canopy having much advantage on a non waterfront park."

tampabayrays,37a5up,fosh1zzle,1 point,Thu May 28 03:37:28 2015 UTC,Maybe something on the waterfront   Maybe if they could make a dome out of glass but there's no way to have an open stadium where it rains every day and is hot as hell.
tampabayrays,37a5up,one80oneday,3,Wed May 27 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"This is the point I've been wanting to make for a while. Everybody wants an open top Stadium until they actually get it, then they'll miss the AC of the Trop :)"
tampabayrays,37a5up,LassKibble,1 point,Thu May 28 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"Dredge up the bay, put it on the Tampa side, party barges from st Pete to Tampa. Park your boat at the stadium marina!"
tampabayrays,37a5up,fosh1zzle,5,Thu May 28 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Tampa is the population center. Building a stadium in Tampa would give fans a central location, as opposed to St. Pete. Right Off I-4 by the casino would be a great spot, imo."
tampabayrays,37a5up,skelder93,4,Tue May 26 05:54:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who has now relocated to the west side of Orlando, I am a huge proponent for a stadium there. Not only does it give all of Tampa access, but you can start to spread to Lakeland and even the west side of Orlando.  But you would effectively be cutting off St. Pete because it would really be far away from them at that point."
tampabayrays,37a5up,HighLifeDrinker,4,Tue May 26 16:17:20 2015 UTC,I think enough people commute to Tampa from St.Pete anyway that it wouldn't be that big of a deal. You could get off of work and head over there immediately after like a lot of people do with the Lightning.
tampabayrays,37a5up,skelder93,2,Tue May 26 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree...this would create the opposite problem....too hard for Pinellas to get to.  Downtown Tampa and Westshore are the only real, viable location options...plus, those two are in the center of where all the offices are (i.e. corporate support)."
tampabayrays,37a5up,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Wed May 27 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"The big thing is that people think DT Tampa = Population, and it doesn't. So talking bridge access isn't everything. They key for the Rays is to be equally accessible to Brandon, Carrolwood, South Tampa, and North Tampa. People say ""Tampa"", but mean ""Tampa side of the Bay""."
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,1 point,Tue May 26 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"Downtown Tampa couldn't be further from the population base if you tried (in terms of definition, not location.). However, downtown is very accessible via 275 from carrollwood & north Tampa and I-4 from Brandon and beyond. And you tend to miss the worst of the traffic from these communities in those highways. I think that's why everyone keeps talking about downtown as a location.  Not because of the population but because of the access points."
tampabayrays,37a5up,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Tue May 26 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yep! That's what I was driving at, if it wasn't really clear.  To most people not from Tampa, we're not an urban center. It's more like a giant office park with residential housing around it.   That being said, I wish they could have secured the land where the Greyhound track is, or maybe some of the old empty land around West Ybor (ok, I'm biased being from Brandon.)"
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,2,Tue May 26 21:20:26 2015 UTC,Something near Ybor works for me in Carrollwood. Ten minutes on 275 and you're there.
tampabayrays,37a5up,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Tue May 26 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"Downside is that it would have to be a lot of land. For example, if you were to drop Steinbrenner Field into Ybor it would take up a good portion of West Ybor on the other side of the Crosstown.  Although it could spur development in East Tampa around 56th."
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,1 point,Tue May 26 22:10:24 2015 UTC,Damn. I'm not sure if that image is making me feel Steinbrenner Field is bigger than I thought or that area is smaller than I thought.
tampabayrays,37a5up,millionaremattdavis,3,Tue May 26 22:28:11 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly big, lot wise. The field is tiny, only 11,000 sets. But the parking, and practice stuff all takes up space. Here's a comparison of how big Yankee Stadium would be if you dropped it directly in Historic Ybor. So maybe an area of 2x3 blocks could fit a stadium. Truthfully, you could fit that into the space the 18th St Playground sits on if you were to build in College Hill. You could get cute and drop it 4th & 60 / Channelside & 15th, right smack on Avenida Republica De Cuba. Already parking there, it's close to current development, close to the interstate, retains the ""feel"" of Ybor, and gives reason to push development north of Channelside and East of Ybor.  If they built in Ybor it might force them to build a ""ballpark"" not a monstrosity like some of those early 2000's shit holes. Brick facade to fit in with the architecture, etc."
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,1 point,Tue May 26 22:37:29 2015 UTC,I selfishly love the idea of an Ybor stadium. I'd be damn near forced into getting season tickets because of the proximity.

It seems as if St. Pete's council is a big problem, why the hell are these fucks still in office? You guys should start bombarding them with calls, etc or all fingers are on them if they rays leave"
tampabayrays,37a5up,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed May 27 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Well...the problem is, the majority of people who think the Rays shouldn't be in St. Pete don't have a say in who gets elected to the city council of that city. I live just outside the city of Tampa, which isn't even in the same county as St. Pete.   The general consensus from St. Pete people is that the Rays are their team and it wouldn't even work in Tampa because the buccaneers can't sell out games (completely ignoring the fact that the Bucs have been dismal and completely mismanaged for the past decade as the primary reason why no one wants to drop $75 a ticket and $30 on parking there)."

But of course the St. Pete people seem to forget that when trying to talk smack about Tampa. Or they'll try to blow it off because the arena only seats 19,000 people. (Which is still more than the Rays typically draw!)"

tampabayrays,37a5up,Jestaverick,3,Sat May 30 03:39:41 2015 UTC,"Ive been to about 50 rays games in the past 7 or 8 years. I live 1 hour north of tampa, I know a lot of baseball fans, I use to be a regular softball player, and virtually everyone that I've talked to would go to more games if the stadium was closer. It takes me about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 min. But it's not all about the distance, the stadium is bland and besides a couple of restaurants, there is nothing to do before or after the games."
tampabayrays,37a5up,vkw619,1 point,Wed May 27 04:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah the stadium is pretty miserable; and to be honest, I would probably go to more games in the current location if the stadium itself was actually enjoyable. Unfortunately there's no way in hell anyone is going to build another stadium in St. Pete. We need to give Tampa a shot instead of taking baseball away from the entire area."
tampabayrays,37a5up,sveitthrone,1 point,Thu May 28 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"Getting there aside, have you tried going to one of the several places in Downtown St. Pete that has a free shuttle to the Trop and then back? There's plenty to do in Downtown St. Pete."
tampabayrays,37a5up,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Mon Jun 1 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"I really wish they would just tear up that rundown Greyhound track and smack the stadium right there. It would be perfect. Fairgrounds is never going to happen, but I bet putting a stadium where the track is could possibly bring some economy to that area (bit run down last I checked but I'm in Jax now for college)"

tampabayrays,36zuej,Rays8JenningsFan,6,Sat May 23 15:40:23 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it's for a bit of bullpen relief but it definitely surprised me. I haven't really seen much of Franklin so I can't compare them but I was really liking Beckham. We went from a crowded outfield last year to a crowded infield this year.
tampabayrays,36zuej,kimura_snap,4,Sat May 23 15:48:09 2015 UTC,Oh! Does this mean he's gonna play Monday night in Durham? I'm actually here with family for a few days and was curious if there would be any big names playing.
tampabayrays,36zuej,bensly,4,Sat May 23 21:05:55 2015 UTC,Why not nick franklin?!
tampabayrays,36zuej,C0LL0C0,2,Sun May 24 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"And we still keep Cabrerra...  Jesus, Cash..."
tampabayrays,36zuej,jinxnotit,2,Sat May 23 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"Cabrera, a veteran presence, has made 1 error this year. Beck hardly plays the field. It's no secret that Tampa is a defense/pitching oriented team, so I'm thinking it makes sense to stack the field with the best defenders. It's not like the offense is gonna suffer without Beckham when they can barely muster a couple of runs as it is."
tampabayrays,36zuej,Pharaoh10,-1,Sat May 23 23:03:55 2015 UTC,Such a good choice that the guy is now sent back down immediately after the game.  Meanwhile Beckham is tied for most homers on the team and has scouts wondering who they can trade us for over Cabrera stinking up the plate.
tampabayrays,36zuej,jinxnotit,4,Sat May 23 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"Have you not been paying attention all year? Half the rotation is hurt and we desperately need all the pitching help we can get. They've sent Andreise up and down. Colome too, I think.  Also just so you know, Beckham is not tied for the most homers on the team. I'd also venture to guess that his pace isn't sustainable, considering he was lucky to hit five during any one of his years in the minors.  I'm not saying that I dislike Beckham or don't want him on the team, but if you'd really have him over Cab... Well then there's a reason you're not the GM of a Major League Baseball team."
tampabayrays,36zuej,Pharaoh10,2,Sun May 24 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I necessarily disagree with you, but the way you're talking down to people, you are coming across as a major douche bag. Just my 2 cents.  With that said, I think we would have been better off optioning Franklin. Say what you want, Beckham is tied with Longoria for 2nd most HR's on the team, which means he has provided much needed run support that likely wouldn't have been there otherwise. How many do you think Franklin would have had he been there the whole year? 2-3 tops. He has clearly been one of our top hitters this year. I agree that Cabrera shouldn't be sent down. As much as he is killing us offensively, he is easily one of our best defensive players. Forsythe is on fire. Longo and Loney aren't going anywhere. So really the best option, in my opinion, would have been to send Franklin down. This isn't anything against Franklin. We are just stacked in the infield right now, and everyone else has contributed to our success so far this year, except for Franklin."
tampabayrays,36zuej,Mlacombe11909,1 point,Sun May 24 03:26:37 2015 UTC,"I can get behind that. The conversation was not about Franklin, though. If he had said that Franklin, not Cabby, should be sent down over Beckham, I would have agreed. Guy can't hit and doesn't provide stellar D."
tampabayrays,36zuej,Pharaoh10,-1,Sun May 24 04:08:09 2015 UTC,Cash has made stupid decisions all season long. This is just one of many.   But way to be a bitchy apologist with that cop out response.

Lots of cool stuff to see, it's almost mini-Cooperstown ish. Make sure you go up the stairs, a lot of people seem to miss that there is a whole big section up there.   Go to the Rays tank.   Check out The Porch area in the outfield. Kind of a neat place to watch batting practice & even stand for the game if you don't want to sit in your seats.  As far as food, this article covers it. Personally I like to grab a Bloomin' Onion from Outback to bring to my seat."

tampabayrays,36vob2,Jagorilla,3,Tue May 26 03:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the Ted Williams Museum & Hitters Hall of Fame. Really cool stuff for a baseball fan. There's a guy named Byron who works there and he's basically a walking baseball encyclopedia. Awesome guy to shoot the shit with.   Bars there are all pretty much the same. There are cool spots (check out the bars around section 142) but they're all overpriced stadium bullshit. If you do want to pay stadium prices, check out the cigar bar on the second level. A/C, big comfy ass leather chairs, and they stay open after the 7th. There's a huge balcony overlooking the city, too. You could do the touristy Ferg's thing (bar basically in the parking lot of the stadium) but if you're a drunk sports fan like myself, you'll probably dig Five Bucks. 99% of the stuff on their menu is less than $5. It's a really cheap cab ride from there to the stadium or a short walk depending on your level of motivation. Tons of bars along the way to the Trop, too.   God I don't know why everyone shits on the Trop. Sure, it's old, wasn't made for baseball, shitty location, all that. But you know what's awesome? Getting a free parking spot right next to the stadium and going to a game against Boston or NY on a whim without having to break into savings. I went to 27 games last year and never paid more than $30 for lower level tickets. Craigslist is your friend. There are so many companies that give out tickets to their employees and they get sold cheap.   It's definitely no Camden, but you can have an awesome time at the Trop for a reasonable price."

tampabayrays,36vob2,Jagorilla,1 point,Wed May 27 17:27:41 2015 UTC,Most of the city parking spots are only monitored until 6pm. I park on  1st Ave N behind the police station.
tampabayrays,36vob2,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Wed May 27 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"Go early. Hit Ferg's beforehand. Put on your armor in case anyone gives you crap about your O's gear (you won't get any, really....we tend to reserve our enmity for Yankees and Red Sox fans).   In the stadium, go the ray tank and pet the rays.  As others have suggested, do the Ted Williams museum.  Check out the porch in the outfield. Good place to hang out, drink a beer, and watch the game."
tampabayrays,36vob2,edkopp4,3,Sat May 23 00:47:55 2015 UTC,My go-to food option is the Cuban sandwich burger available at Burger Up. It's huge and delicious and comes with a bunch of fries. Grab some free Everglades barbecue sauce from the nearby condiment table and your fries will be perfect. Two people can get pretty full off of this one meal.
tampabayrays,36vob2,raging_pussies,3,Sat May 23 01:44:41 2015 UTC,food wise? skip the mac & cheese footlong at the tap room behind deep center in the concourse. taco bus outside section 149 is probably your best bet.

Is it because of the holiday or sunday day game?"
tampabayrays,36vob2,BentRods,4,Fri May 22 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's a Sunday game on a holiday weekend with a free postgame concert. Should be close to 30,000 people there.

tampabayrays,36o35q,mkultra3,4,Thu May 21 00:06:18 2015 UTC,Loney Forsythe DeJesus. I like this part of the lineup
tampabayrays,36o35q,kimura_snap,3,Thu May 21 00:04:49 2015 UTC,AH crap. The way we were swinging at Perez' stuff I hope we can get some guys on base and catch up.

tampabayrays,36m7bz,twoscoop,2,Wed May 20 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"Surgery on a torn labrum is very serious and potentially career altering/ending. It's not like tommy john that has a high success rate with pitchers coming back with minimal complications and dip in performance. If he opts into this surgery, there's no doubt his velocity will decrease for the remainder of his career and might experience chronic pain. Plus it's a grueling rehab. Serious stuff."
tampabayrays,36m7bz,twoscoop,1 point,Fri May 22 02:34:56 2015 UTC,2 days ago i didn't see it was his shoulder.  How do you even rehab a torn labrum? Swimming pool work? edit: Plyometric Excercise..
tampabayrays,36m7bz,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Fri May 22 18:46:06 2015 UTC,I'm not sure but I know the healing process would be a bitch. There's very little blood circulation in that cartilaginous region.
tampabayrays,36kppd,jinxnotit,14,Wed May 20 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"I love watching this team. Even though we have pitching woes, every pitcher is fun to watch. The bullpen has been great and now we have a lockdown trio of Boxey-McGee-Jepsen (with Geltz and Gomes also doing very well...though Jepsen has been fighthing his command as of late). This lineup is also very balanced, with contact OBP guys, power swing-and-miss beasts and speeeed. Cash is also a great manager; sure he's made his fair share of mistakes, but it looks like he's learning from them and quickly absorbing this experience. I think the most important thing is that the Rays have build a roster of hard working players who have the potential to build on their previous experiences and grow as players. We've seen it this season alone with every starting pitcher.   Lots of props to Silverman and the Rays FO crew for standing up after the entire baseball media collective dismissed them at first."

tampabayrays,36j9c8,RaysBot,2,Tue May 19 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"Morning chaps, love that kind of win. Kiermaier's triple was outrageous and nice to see Cabrera smoke one.  I was very interested to see McGee set up for Box, think it was in part because Markakis and Freeman were in McGee's inning. Still, will wear my Box shirt to my final exam today in the hope it gives me luck. Go Rays!"

Right next to the Rays dugout too."

tampabayrays,36fuys,Stlunatic6006,2,Tue May 19 02:26:22 2015 UTC,Easiest question ever.    Go to the box office.

I mostly get tickets from the store in downtown Tampa. There's a slight fee (I think $1.50 per ticket) so if you live close enough to the trop, just go there. I live north of Tampa so id spend well more than $3 in gas getting there."

tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,2,Sat May 16 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"Duensing and Boyer are both failed starters, I feel like Duensing has been with the Twins forever, he also was a prospect at one point, not sure about Boyer.    Pressly has also been a solid piece out of the pen for the Twins.    Casey Fien is hurt and Tim Stauffer (that one that had a few good seasons as a SP for the Padres) is out too.    Other than that, you're right, I have no idea who fills out that pen."
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 16 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I looked over the roster and assumed Duensing was starting! Haha, no idea he was a RP now. Also know Fien and Stauffer (still thought he was in the Padres org, haha)."
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,1 point,Sat May 16 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Im not sure why, but I thought Stauffer went to the Dodgers"
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 16 02:41:22 2015 UTC,To be fair how many opposition fans wonder who the fuck Steve Geltz is?
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,2,Sat May 16 02:26:41 2015 UTC,And McGee is certainly the best pitcher no one has heard of
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 16 02:31:19 2015 UTC,"This is true, but the McGee/Boxey/Jepsen combo are pretty well known. Maybe not the backend (except Frieri)."
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,3,Sat May 16 02:29:21 2015 UTC,aiite aiite aiite aiite aiite aiite lets get that run back.
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,3,Sat May 16 02:17:56 2015 UTC,We're still alive here...
tampabayrays,363pci,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat May 16 02:17:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, am I the only person hearing that Windows alert sound on the Rays broadcast?  I would hear that same damn sound last season too"
tampabayrays,363pci,anonymau5,2,Sat May 16 02:17:35 2015 UTC,Left odo in there=screwe'd him out of the win.
tampabayrays,363pci,C0LL0C0,-2,Sat May 16 02:10:58 2015 UTC,Cash is the worst manager.
tampabayrays,363pci,lolyou22,2,Sat May 16 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"He's made a ton of questionable calls this season that just leave you going ""wtf?""."
tampabayrays,363pci,jinxnotit,3,Sat May 16 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"This game's on Cash. No reason for Odo to come back out there, especially with the bullpen rested."
tampabayrays,363pci,botts,2,Sat May 16 02:09:29 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he will say anything about it after the game, he owned up to something else a week or so ago.  It was a ballsy move for sure."
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,3,Sat May 16 02:16:51 2015 UTC,Damn it.
tampabayrays,363pci,C0LL0C0,3,Sat May 16 02:09:15 2015 UTC,NOOOOO!
tampabayrays,363pci,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Sat May 16 02:08:57 2015 UTC,Ah crap.
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,3,Sat May 16 02:08:44 2015 UTC,Well shit
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,3,Sat May 16 02:08:27 2015 UTC,BRING in MCGEE!
tampabayrays,363pci,C0LL0C0,3,Sat May 16 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"Base hit, probably RIP streak right?"
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,3,Sat May 16 02:06:41 2015 UTC,Odorizzi going back up for the streak.
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,3,Sat May 16 02:03:51 2015 UTC,Baseball doesn't have to be pretty.
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,2,Sat May 16 01:55:56 2015 UTC,Nice getting out of that jam...
tampabayrays,363pci,Rays8JenningsFan,4,Sat May 16 01:55:51 2015 UTC,Odo! Hell yea. Nice work
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,3,Sat May 16 01:55:32 2015 UTC,Let's go Jake!
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,3,Sat May 16 01:55:15 2015 UTC,Thats 2!
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 16 01:53:21 2015 UTC,Cabrera's first error all year.
tampabayrays,363pci,Scory22,2,Sat May 16 01:50:44 2015 UTC,Thats 1!
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 16 01:50:37 2015 UTC,Damnit Cabrera!
tampabayrays,363pci,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat May 16 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"Alright, Odo, bail em out."
tampabayrays,363pci,zeitfalle,5,Sat May 16 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"The advantages of a strong defense go on and on and on sometimes in my opinion. Right there Escobar not making that play has so many knock on effects beyond the fact that we get a run.   Hughes gets an extra hit and an extra earned run on his record, both of which have a knock on effect on his confidence Hughes should be out of the inning and is instantly deflated massively from that - it must get him so frustrated Hughes now has to throw an extra 6ish pitches to get the next guy as well, having knock on effects on his inning count and their bullpen Hughes now isn't confident putting anything in the zone that could be turned into the gap - meaning he tries harder to paint the corners and is gonna throw more pitches and probably more walks. Odo throws something in the zone that gets driven just there, Kiermaier glides across and puts it away. Odorizzi now just pitches knowing the guys behind him have his back, Hughes is constantly worrying about them"
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,4,Sat May 16 01:37:38 2015 UTC,"Its not any less impressive, but his catches just make me slightly nod my head at this point"
tampabayrays,363pci,xiedian,4,Sat May 16 01:35:56 2015 UTC,We've been so spoiled by great defense over the years hahaha. We even expect it from Asdrubal now - how did that happen?
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,2,Sat May 16 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pleasantly surprised at Cabrera's defense , he looks silky smooth on this delivery , it just looks very natural"
tampabayrays,363pci,xiedian,4,Sat May 16 01:41:52 2015 UTC,Go ahead run on a misplayed popfly
tampabayrays,363pci,Scory22,3,Sat May 16 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha what a crap run, let's go!"
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,5,Sat May 16 01:28:04 2015 UTC,Dude didn't even try
tampabayrays,363pci,xiedian,4,Sat May 16 01:28:04 2015 UTC,Kiermaier would've made that play blindfolded with his glove arm tied behind his back
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,2,Sat May 16 01:28:44 2015 UTC,Kk could've backpedaled to the ball and still caught it
tampabayrays,363pci,xiedian,4,Sat May 16 01:31:46 2015 UTC,Butler's ability to go opposite field impresses me
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,3,Sat May 16 01:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yankees are down 2-0 to the Royals, if we get our shit together here, we share the lead of first place."
tampabayrays,363pci,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sat May 16 01:11:22 2015 UTC,They signed Hughes until 2019!? Oh my...
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,3,Sat May 16 00:52:33 2015 UTC,Is Joey Butler a better fielder than Dejesus?  Why not have Butler DH and Dejesus in LF?
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,5,Sat May 16 00:35:38 2015 UTC,DeJesus is 35 now. Needs days off his feet.
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,5,Sat May 16 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I had no idea, I thought he was like 30 tops.  Dude has more energy than half the league."
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,3,Sat May 16 00:45:23 2015 UTC,He still plays the game hard and that's part of the reason I like him so much
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,6,Sat May 16 00:49:40 2015 UTC,He smoked that
tampabayrays,363pci,xiedian,4,Sat May 16 00:30:57 2015 UTC,DeJesus is a beastttt.
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,3,Sat May 16 00:30:55 2015 UTC,Mashed
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,4,Sat May 16 00:30:43 2015 UTC,WOOO DEJESUS DINGER
tampabayrays,363pci,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 16 00:30:39 2015 UTC,Odo all over
tampabayrays,363pci,Godzmodiar7,4,Sat May 16 00:27:23 2015 UTC,"That was a pretty big spot for Odo, hopefully the offense can time up Hughes."
tampabayrays,363pci,FuriousTarts,3,Sat May 16 00:26:02 2015 UTC,Great result to get out of that inning scoreless
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,3,Sat May 16 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, the new Rays tradition of loading the bases in the first inning."
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,3,Sat May 16 00:21:00 2015 UTC,I don't wanna exaggerate but that Twins lineup is probably the worst ever put together in the history of competitive baseball and if we don't win tonight it will be a travesty so great we might as well release every single member of personnel from their contracts and start the franchise over from the ground up.
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,3,Fri May 15 23:27:44 2015 UTC,"Plus we're facing our old friend Phil ""Home Run"" Hughes. Hopefully he can fill the zone; we've got a ton of aggressive hitters who should do well."
tampabayrays,363pci,mkultra3,3,Fri May 15 23:37:56 2015 UTC,yeah the ball flies in Target Field doesn't it?
tampabayrays,363pci,colwell25,2,Fri May 15 23:39:03 2015 UTC,This is ture as well.....Lets take this game back to the Bronx!

tampabayrays,363pci,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sat May 16 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"Ahh, the two hot teams that nobody though would be competing are competing. I almost hate playing the Twins because I want them to do well in the AL Central.... but I'm also remembering how they used to dominate us 5ish years ago. Always going to remember that double header when Zobrist went crazy at Target Feild as well. Glad to watch games in Minnesota again. Hopefully it'll be a series we can win!"
tampabayrays,363f0k,colwell25,3,Fri May 15 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I apologise if this has already been shared. - I had a quick search and couldn't find it.  I thought this have a really interesting look into comparing Rivera and Molina's receiving and framing techniques, and with Rivera's bat hopefully starting to heat up I think we could have one incredibly useful catcher on our hands."
tampabayrays,363f0k,Dirtydirtdirtt,2,Fri May 15 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel he will be pretty useful. More so then Wilson. I am always happy when I see him behind the plate."
tampabayrays,360sz7,lolyou22,2,Fri May 15 03:20:55 2015 UTC,I absolutely love our pen right now
tampabayrays,360sz7,colwell25,3,Fri May 15 15:47:13 2015 UTC,Gomes-Jepsen-Boxy-McGee   Get the lead by the 6th and we have a great chance of winning.

tampabayrays,35ze56,Rays8JenningsFan,5,Fri May 15 02:00:18 2015 UTC,Woohoo! One game out! Onto Minnesota!
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,9,Fri May 15 01:57:05 2015 UTC,4-6 is so much better than 0-5.
tampabayrays,35ze56,zeitfalle,5,Fri May 15 01:56:37 2015 UTC,NOOO! The Shutout! Our Run Differential! All Sullied!
tampabayrays,35ze56,Rays8JenningsFan,7,Fri May 15 01:55:45 2015 UTC,A-Rod and his damn homeruns. What year is it?
tampabayrays,35ze56,DylanRamsey,6,Fri May 15 01:53:11 2015 UTC,Gardner's facial hair is the only facial hair that the Yankees should disallow.
tampabayrays,35ze56,zeitfalle,4,Fri May 15 01:42:57 2015 UTC,I think that could be why Karns shaves his. He doesn't want any association with that tragedy.
tampabayrays,35ze56,anonymau5,4,Fri May 15 01:44:58 2015 UTC,He looks like he's ready to hit the bath house.
tampabayrays,35ze56,Dirtydirtdirtt,3,Fri May 15 02:05:20 2015 UTC,"That, or a trip to Thailand"
tampabayrays,35ze56,anonymau5,6,Fri May 15 02:40:53 2015 UTC,Rivera pullin' a McCann.

tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,8,Fri May 15 01:32:37 2015 UTC,You missed this weeks venture into....the twilight zoneee
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,6,Fri May 15 01:25:13 2015 UTC,Matt is on fire tonight!
tampabayrays,35ze56,ZNM210,7,Fri May 15 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, great plays on the field tonight. This is Rays baseball, not the mess last year."
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,9,Fri May 15 00:42:26 2015 UTC,Rivera had some of that good good before the game i guess. No other explanation
tampabayrays,35ze56,xiedian,5,Fri May 15 00:35:07 2015 UTC,More runs! We're being spoilt
tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,5,Fri May 15 00:34:54 2015 UTC,This is the kind of game series that creates new Rays fans. You just can't watch this with indifference.
tampabayrays,35ze56,anonymau5,4,Fri May 15 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, great snag by Loney!"
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,4,Fri May 15 00:26:57 2015 UTC,Ramirez is looking good.

tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,6,Thu May 14 23:32:30 2015 UTC,I'm here to cheer on Souza   Did he come close to TOOTBLAN? :(
tampabayrays,35ze56,purplepenned,3,Thu May 14 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"RE TOOTBLAN, his baserunning isn't quite honed in and he does some weird shit. Not very smart at tagging and running, and there was a game in the bottom of the 9th where he was on second with one out, Forsythe hit a long double and he failed to score after checking back to kinda tag up, ultimately costing us the game."
tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,2,Thu May 14 23:36:57 2015 UTC,I guess the 1B coach might have to be careful with Souza
tampabayrays,35ze56,purplepenned,3,Thu May 14 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"If his ability to put bat to ball was as good as his raw power he'd be the best player in the history of baseball. I like him a lot and if he works out a few kinks in his plate approach he should be a great player for us.  Also, I caught the end of your guys' game last night before ours started (as someone who would consider the Nats to be his favorite NL team) and what a finish that was!"
tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,3,Thu May 14 23:34:11 2015 UTC,Overall it was an incredibly ugly game. So many fielding errors...
tampabayrays,35ze56,purplepenned,3,Thu May 14 23:37:04 2015 UTC,Love his hustle and effort. He's been struggling but reports are that he's putting in a lot of extra work.   The same can't be said about another young RF we had...
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,3,Thu May 14 23:33:36 2015 UTC,haha I wonder who you might be refer-  looks at lineups for tonight  oh
tampabayrays,35ze56,purplepenned,4,Thu May 14 23:36:01 2015 UTC,he's talking about this guy
tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,5,Thu May 14 23:38:43 2015 UTC,I know. Nats are playing the Padres tonight (weather pending)
tampabayrays,35ze56,purplepenned,1 point,Thu May 14 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"What a coincidence, I'm just here so I don't get fined."
tampabayrays,35ze56,Rays8JenningsFan,3,Thu May 14 23:33:05 2015 UTC,What's Souza doing out there?
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,2,Thu May 14 23:30:57 2015 UTC,the fucks up with souza on the base paths
tampabayrays,35ze56,princeofbel-air,3,Thu May 14 23:28:51 2015 UTC,Nice hustle Souza.
tampabayrays,35ze56,mkultra3,3,Thu May 14 23:20:46 2015 UTC,OH MY GOD SOUZA WHAT A CATCH

tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,3,Thu May 14 23:17:58 2015 UTC,I can't think of a better duo at the top of a lineup better than Ellsbury and Gardner. If we can limit them tonight then I think we have a solid chance of winning
tampabayrays,35ze56,CooperEarly,4,Thu May 14 23:13:57 2015 UTC,"Predicting the Yankees to score two in a rough first, Ramirez to kinda settle, Rays to score 3, all on bases loaded HBPs"
tampabayrays,35ze56,colwell25,6,Thu May 14 23:12:14 2015 UTC,If we can take 3 of 4 from the Yanks with a win tonight that will be absolutely huge. Lets fucking go boys!
tampabayrays,35ze56,CooperEarly,5,Thu May 14 23:11:14 2015 UTC,Go Rays!!! Got a pizza on the way and looking forward to putting my feet up and relaxing tonight!

tampabayrays,35v8ek,colwell25,6,Thu May 14 01:56:15 2015 UTC,You just can't hit that. Nasty.

tampabayrays,35v8ek,zeitfalle,3,Thu May 14 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"I think that Rivera will get better. He's had some better at bats. But yeah, in terms of overall production, this he's been way better than Molina (both receiving and his arm)."
tampabayrays,35v8ek,mkultra3,3,Thu May 14 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"Question is, is he better than Hanigan? I think yes but there's not loads in it, and he is more durable than Hanigan which is a big plus"
tampabayrays,35v8ek,colwell25,2,Thu May 14 01:36:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think if we were guaranteed regular playing time for Hanigan, I would prefer him. I was excited when the Rays acquired him last year. But yeah, I never saw the injuries that came with him first hand."

tampabayrays,35v8ek,mkultra3,6,Wed May 13 23:52:49 2015 UTC,I got a filthy confession for you.  Bloop base hits that fall between infield and outfield are so much better than ringing singles

Probably not the prospect Moore was but still pretty damn good.   Glad to finally see some of the fruits of that massive 2011 draft with Mahtook and now Snell making their presence. Taylor Guerreri is also almost back from TJS.

tampabayrays,35r08w,mkultra3,2,Tue May 12 23:27:13 2015 UTC,Archer's actually done very well to work out of that with just two runs

tampabayrays,35mt84,snoharm,1 point,Tue May 12 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Rivera can't hit to save his life, but that doesn't stop him from swinging at the first pitch every time. Why not see a few pitches and at least make the guy work for it? He's gotta be the easiest out in the AL"
tampabayrays,35mt84,Pharaoh10,2,Tue May 12 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"I really really really like Colome, should be in the rotation now. Even should be in if everyone is healthy. I think he is better than Karns."
tampabayrays,35mt84,Krapul,2,Mon May 11 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"He most certainly is better than karns. Better control, better movement."
tampabayrays,35mt84,botts,2,Mon May 11 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"My only problem is his lack of a changeup. Karns has a more complete arsenal. The good news is that Colome can throw consistent strikes now. Previously, this was not the case. Karns also struggles with command and his fbs are darts (no movement like Colome). Colome's stuff also translates very well in the bullpen when comparing Karns.   So yeah, pros and cons for each. I'm just glad that we have depth to cover for our injuries."
tampabayrays,35mt84,mkultra3,4,Mon May 11 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"I do not get how that wasn't blocking.  I saw that called the other 99/100 times last season. I have no dog in this fight, Marlins fan, but cmon. Makes no fucking sense to me."
tampabayrays,35mt84,3_Mighty_Ninja_Ducks,1 point,Mon May 11 23:32:38 2015 UTC,He had to reach to catch the ball. If you are making a play on the ball it's not blocking.
tampabayrays,35mt84,colwell25,4,Mon May 11 23:43:36 2015 UTC,I think the route Souza ran to the plate didn't help him. If he'd run straight at McCann (dangerously) he would've had a better chance of getting a call
tampabayrays,35mt84,kimura_snap,3,Mon May 11 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If there wasn't a rule and that was a more aggressive runner he's gonna fucking destroy the catcher. I don't like the rule or catchers getting hurt, but regardless, they have no consistency with that"
tampabayrays,35mt84,Krapul,5,Mon May 11 23:35:21 2015 UTC,Dumb play. Dumb rule. Dumb challenge.  But ok ...
tampabayrays,35mt84,colwell25,4,Mon May 11 23:32:17 2015 UTC,That is a wasted challenge
tampabayrays,35mt84,snoharm,3,Mon May 11 23:31:18 2015 UTC,Blocking the plate I guess? Cash isn't very conservative with his reviews
tampabayrays,35mt84,Krapul,2,Mon May 11 23:31:47 2015 UTC,Got a pretty bad record with them it seems like.  Does he not have a team telling him when to review?
tampabayrays,35mt84,colwell25,2,Mon May 11 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"That's his first bad review I can recall had some weird calls that stood that were absolutely wrong so it is bad luck, not his fault. He could well be 4/12 (or whatever)"
tampabayrays,35mt84,mkultra3,2,Mon May 11 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"I think we need to get better at relaying that to him, yeah. I guess the theory is that how many run scoring challenge plays are you gonna get in a game? Rarely more than 1, so it's kinda worth using that challenge in hope. You lose 100% of the challenges you don't take"
tampabayrays,35mt84,botts,2,Mon May 11 23:35:09 2015 UTC,"I think he does but he challenges anyway. I mean, we haven't had a situation where we needed a challange and didnt have one. If you got em, might as well use em.   Cash in many respects is an aggressive manager, and I like it."
tampabayrays,35mt84,colwell25,0,Mon May 11 23:34:17 2015 UTC,EVERY time I start to give Souza a chance.... He does stupid shit like that. Hopefully this is blocking the plate but I'm not holding my breath  Edit: fuckin Souza man. Ugh
tampabayrays,35mt84,Krapul,2,Mon May 11 23:30:17 2015 UTC,Souza's got to get running sooner

tampabayrays,35hqhw,Dirtydirtdirtt,3,Sun May 10 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"I have doubts about the offense keeping it up for a whole season though. Longo and Loney are the only guaranteed bats, and that's if they stay healthy. Everyone else is unproven so far."
tampabayrays,35hqhw,Endless_Summer,2,Sun May 10 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. Dejesus can hit pretty well, and he can foul out balls when he gets to a full count. Forsythe and KK can pretty much do the same thing.  Souza and Cabrera are the only 2 that I worry about because they are almost always in the line up. Souza consistently swings at the first pitch and then backs himself into a corner and Cabrera just seems to swing wildly.   Butler, Beckham, Guyer and Elmore and are still pretty fresh to the rotation so I will continue to watch them. But so far, they don't look terrible.   The only one I really despise hitting is Wilson."
tampabayrays,35hqhw,Dirtydirtdirtt,2,Sun May 10 15:48:57 2015 UTC,Yeah Cabrera makes me cringe at the plate. He already hit his home run for the year too..

tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,4,Sun May 10 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of pinch-hitting for Guyer here. Especially, if its not Loney. Hopefully, I can eat my words."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 19:47:54 2015 UTC,Well executed. Tough pitch to bunt.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 19:47:13 2015 UTC,Somebody please .gif that
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,4,Sun May 10 19:39:11 2015 UTC,What a play!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 19:38:56 2015 UTC,wow that was one of the best plays I've ever seen a third baseman make
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Pharaoh10,3,Sun May 10 19:38:47 2015 UTC,The fuck was that play? hahahaha
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,3,Sun May 10 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"Well, on a positive note, we're lucky that hanger stayed in the yard."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 19:27:45 2015 UTC,Fuck this game
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,3,Sun May 10 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"Man, he wanted none of Fielder."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 19:26:18 2015 UTC,Oh god this is where it's gonna fall apart...
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Pharaoh10,3,Sun May 10 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"If that was a ""Wandy Zone,"" that would have been a 2 ball 5 strike count."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,4,Sun May 10 19:23:03 2015 UTC,Butler's ABs look like what I imagine my ABs would look like if I faced MLB pitching.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,2,Sun May 10 19:11:34 2015 UTC,lmfao our stadium is coming unglued
tampabayrays,35hpvf,FuriousTarts,3,Sun May 10 19:05:15 2015 UTC,There we go!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 19:00:15 2015 UTC,Huge. Play. Tim. Beckham.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 19:00:14 2015 UTC,Jake Odorizzi. What a beast.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,FuriousTarts,2,Sun May 10 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"Well done Jake, yet another very very good outing"
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Damn these shitty little bloop hits.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"Odorizzi's transformation has been so incredible that he's easily dealing nearly 7IP of one run ball while ill as fuck on 83 pitches, and I'm barely surprised"
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,4,Sun May 10 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, Odo looks queasy as hell after that."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 18:51:06 2015 UTC,unbelievable. ANYTHING but gidp.

tampabayrays,35hpvf,Krapul,3,Sun May 10 18:46:35 2015 UTC,Looks like the strike zone has been fixed.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,FuriousTarts,3,Sun May 10 18:45:05 2015 UTC,First career walk for this ump!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,2,Sun May 10 18:44:48 2015 UTC,C'mon Longo! Keep it up
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Krapul,3,Sun May 10 18:44:48 2015 UTC,LETS GO LONGO!!!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,YouEnjoyMyself84,5,Sun May 10 18:44:41 2015 UTC,88 mph down the pipe. C'mon Souza.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,4,Sun May 10 18:44:36 2015 UTC,Seems Cash lit a fire under the ump's ass
tampabayrays,35hpvf,PinheadRecords,5,Sun May 10 18:43:48 2015 UTC,KK with the take out slide on the ump
tampabayrays,35hpvf,tedinasitcom,6,Sun May 10 18:42:18 2015 UTC,Kiermaier is so fast. Love that guy.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,5,Sun May 10 18:42:03 2015 UTC,Guyer!!!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,6,Sun May 10 18:41:52 2015 UTC,YES!! GUYER ON FIRE!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Krapul,3,Sun May 10 18:41:44 2015 UTC,Pulling nearly every other pitch into that short/3rd gap. Deserved a hit to lead off the ballgame
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,5,Sun May 10 18:42:18 2015 UTC,Do you guys remember when Johnny Damon got rung up on a pitch that hit him?
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,6,Sun May 10 18:41:37 2015 UTC,Ump almost called that a strike until he heard it hit Rivera.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,5,Sun May 10 18:39:48 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, just tuning in, I brought the hit mojo with me"
tampabayrays,35hpvf,JoebobZanzibar,3,Sun May 10 18:37:49 2015 UTC,Can you find your 'Brandon Guyer 3 run mash' mojo please?
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 18:39:53 2015 UTC,I'll take that mojo baby let's goooooo!!!!!

tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,2,Sun May 10 18:42:40 2015 UTC,DON'T STOP!!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,3,Sun May 10 18:42:36 2015 UTC,Smart from Tim on the basepads there
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you Beckham, that's all I wanted."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,FuriousTarts,6,Sun May 10 18:35:39 2015 UTC,Bex saving us from another embarrassing Mother's Day at the Trop.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,mkultra3,5,Sun May 10 18:35:38 2015 UTC,Braden was on fire that day. He didn't have the benefit of the strike zone Wandy has had today.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,4,Sun May 10 18:37:36 2015 UTC,Holy fuck that Home Plate Umpire should go back to fucking little league
tampabayrays,35hpvf,clydefrog811,3,Sun May 10 18:35:34 2015 UTC,A baserunner!!!! We got a baserunner!
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,5,Sun May 10 18:34:52 2015 UTC,Is this ump just not picking up Wandy's curve or something?
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,4,Sun May 10 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"DUDE, that first pitch strike to Beckham was fuckin' awful."
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,6,Sun May 10 18:34:02 2015 UTC,Odo pitching so well for having the flu.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,zeitfalle,3,Sun May 10 18:32:27 2015 UTC,Probably following the Archer approach between innings
tampabayrays,35hpvf,tedinasitcom,4,Sun May 10 18:34:39 2015 UTC,I'm starting to get images of Dallas Braden in my head.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Kjcool2,6,Sun May 10 18:26:01 2015 UTC,Angry Cash is awesome
tampabayrays,35hpvf,mkultra3,4,Sun May 10 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Didn't know what to make of him at the start of the season, but fuck, he's not shy at coming forward..."

tampabayrays,35hpvf,Krapul,3,Sun May 10 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, are you fucking kidding?!"
tampabayrays,35hpvf,PinheadRecords,3,Sun May 10 18:22:19 2015 UTC,Isn't Wandy Rodriguez total ass? Wtf is going on here?
tampabayrays,35hpvf,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 18:20:06 2015 UTC,Were total assier.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,YouEnjoyMyself84,3,Sun May 10 18:20:56 2015 UTC,Wow so off the plate...
tampabayrays,35hpvf,mkultra3,3,Sun May 10 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a walk"
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Krapul,5,Sun May 10 18:08:59 2015 UTC,Odorizzi looks like hes going to hurl...
tampabayrays,35hpvf,mkultra3,6,Sun May 10 17:29:23 2015 UTC,Yeah you can see he is not feeling 100%
tampabayrays,35hpvf,Krapul,3,Sun May 10 17:44:28 2015 UTC,Sweating so much. Looks clammy.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,mkultra3,2,Sun May 10 17:45:51 2015 UTC,Souza strikes out at an alarming rate. Dudes already at 45 Ks. Tied for second most in the league.
tampabayrays,35hpvf,YouEnjoyMyself84,6,Sun May 10 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"Lets take this series! I know we got some bad news yesterday, but we have to be thankful that we've guys like Odo and Arch still in the rotation."

tampabayrays,35guta,Tdailey3296,6,Sun May 10 05:50:02 2015 UTC,Do all of our pitchers need surgery at the same time?
tampabayrays,35guta,lexluthzor,4,Sun May 10 12:00:01 2015 UTC,What in the actual fuck is happening to us.
tampabayrays,35guta,YouEnjoyMyself84,2,Sun May 10 14:01:57 2015 UTC,The injury bug is one of the most frustrating things to endure as a sports fan.
tampabayrays,35guta,newtothelyte,2,Sun May 10 14:39:09 2015 UTC,Wow. That sucks  can we trade him for Price ?
tampabayrays,35guta,BetterOffLeftBehind,2,Sun May 10 12:41:40 2015 UTC,If we did then Price would probably end up on the DL at the rate we're going...

tampabayrays,35e2b4,EvelandsRule,12,Sat May 9 18:02:34 2015 UTC,Ummm...pretty sure he was making a joke about all the guys on the DL.

tampabayrays,35f44m,psaepf2009,1 point,Sun May 10 01:58:26 2015 UTC,Why did Bellatti get the win? We didn't relinquish his lead.
tampabayrays,35f44m,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun May 10 01:52:01 2015 UTC,"Starter has to go 5IP to get the win. Geltz pitched from 4.2 to 5, then Bellatti pitched from 5 to 8.1, and because two relievers changed over at 5 the winner is at the scorer's discretion I think. Weird rules"
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 01:56:15 2015 UTC,"Weird finish! Big win on Andriese's start. In many ways, with Detwiler pitching today it made more sense for us to match up this way. Big win and I'm happy"
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 01:29:36 2015 UTC,Just the threat of Souza's arm saving a run there!
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,2,Sun May 10 01:26:39 2015 UTC,Would you believe Cabera just hit a Homer!?
tampabayrays,35f44m,Rays8JenningsFan,2,Sun May 10 01:10:44 2015 UTC,Delighted for him to get that weight off his shoulders

tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,3,Sat May 9 23:46:10 2015 UTC,Rosales being a massive dick there
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,3,Sat May 9 23:37:25 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a trend this year, forcing baserunners off the bag and getting away with it."
tampabayrays,35f44m,JoebobZanzibar,2,Sat May 9 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously could've caused an injury, and that's not even mentioning that it's totally unsportsmanlike. In many ways comparable to a catcher pushing a hitter just before the pitcher pitches."
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,2,Sat May 9 23:43:24 2015 UTC,Gomes got a lefty out!
tampabayrays,35f44m,zeitfalle,2,Sat May 9 23:30:18 2015 UTC,Im back! Just for this game though!
tampabayrays,35f44m,Krapul,2,Sat May 9 23:24:27 2015 UTC,Cabrera has quitely been very good at that SS this season
tampabayrays,35f44m,xiedian,2,Sat May 9 23:17:53 2015 UTC,Anyone here know why they aren't announcing Prince Fielder at bat? Everyone else but him and it's twice in a row.

tampabayrays,35f44m,PinheadRecords,2,Sat May 9 22:28:38 2015 UTC,LONGOOOOOOOOOO
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,3,Sat May 9 22:27:34 2015 UTC,Let's go Andriese! Huge confidence boost coming up from AAA to strike a guy out to work out of a first inning jam
tampabayrays,35f44m,colwell25,4,Sat May 9 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"Don't forget guys, this is the free game on mlb.tv.  The stream is more fun though."

tampabayrays,35cypg,piejacker,2,Sat May 9 03:11:08 2015 UTC,My god. This team is like my fantasy team. Can't catch a fucking break.
tampabayrays,35cypg,MisterPresident813,2,Sat May 9 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"Goddamnit. Take all the elbows you want, Baseball Gods...just don't touch the shoulders."
tampabayrays,35cypg,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 9 03:51:52 2015 UTC,So Andriese starts for Odorizzi and then Ramirez starts for Smyly? Fuck me how has our rotation managed to weaken since the start of the year?
tampabayrays,35cypg,colwell25,1 point,Sat May 9 10:41:35 2015 UTC,"I think the plan is to have Smyly pitch Sunday if he's up to it. Otherwise, use a combination of the new callup Andrew Bellatti and Ramirez."
tampabayrays,35cypg,colwell25,2,Sat May 9 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean Odo on Sunday but yeah, hope so. Thought we were done with 3 inning starts for a while but ah well"
tampabayrays,35cypg,colwell25,1 point,Sat May 9 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, my bad. Yeah, I think at this point its a total mystery how many innings these AAA pitchers can give us. I really hope Smyly's DL stinit isn't too long."

tampabayrays,35bp73,kowboytrav,7,Fri May 8 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"I have to ask... why was an MRI apparently not done back in spring training? If this was apparently a torn UCL all along, and not tendinitis, he could have had the surgery almost two months ago."
tampabayrays,35bp73,Kennertron,1 point,Fri May 8 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, he did indeed have tendonitis at the time. So they treated that, then discovered he had a torn UCL as well. What I'm not entirely sure about is did he have the tear back in the spring or did it happen during his rehab (or tear more)."
tampabayrays,35bp73,mkultra3,7,Sat May 9 03:29:23 2015 UTC,"Feeling the same as I did with the Matt Moore one, maybe even worse since Cobb is such a damn good pitcher right now. I think this is for the best. I guess it's good that we're getting Moore back soon.   Wish him all the best. The road to recovery is long but he's a hard ass worker, so I have no doubt he'll pull through."
tampabayrays,35bp73,kowboytrav,6,Fri May 8 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"As kind of a silver lining, I wonder if this would give the Rays any kind of leverage to sign Cobb to a team-friendly extension like the one Archer signed."
tampabayrays,35bp73,zeitfalle,1 point,Fri May 8 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'm glad there was an explanation for Moore's sharp decline after looking like a #1 starter when he made his debut at the end of the 2011 season. Also, that 2011 ALDS start against a incredible Rangers lineup was ridiculous. I'll remember that shit forever."

tampabayrays,35bp73,lexluthzor,1 point,Fri May 8 22:54:04 2015 UTC,Starting to think the Rays have a rotation for what starting pitcher should get Tommy John's next.     Chris Archer is gonna get it in 2016 if it's any indication.

tampabayrays,35bp73,one80oneday,1 point,Sat May 9 03:49:49 2015 UTC,Have a feeling the reason we get these awesome players is because they're due for surgery

tampabayrays,35bp73,zeitfalle,1 point,Fri May 8 19:52:40 2015 UTC,Good choice. I'd rather he come back 85% with a chance to improve next year than delay the knife a la Tanaka and try to pitch through it at 75% while still having to take the surgery missed time after 3-4 more months.

tampabayrays,35brkh,Niehaus,2,Fri May 8 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

tampabayrays,35brkh,zeitfalle,1 point,Sat May 9 00:03:05 2015 UTC,I wonder if its because of the weird NYYankees/Yankees subreddit drama bullshit.

tampabayrays,353hk5,kimura_snap,3,Thu May 7 01:28:09 2015 UTC,If you give up a single and it's the sixth inning cash will take you out right away. At this point I think it's going to be status quo strategy for the year to use the bullpen this much.
tampabayrays,353hk5,JoebobZanzibar,2,Thu May 7 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"This is Colome's second start of the season, his first game was ~65 pitches and he had 79 tonight. I don't think tonight is a fair night to extrapolate trends from."
tampabayrays,353hk5,kimura_snap,3,Thu May 7 01:12:27 2015 UTC,True. It may have something to do with colome. But he's been quick to pull the trigger regularly. It's been interesting and had different results.
tampabayrays,353hk5,JoebobZanzibar,3,Thu May 7 01:18:01 2015 UTC,He's got experience as a bullpen coach and his rotation is green as hell :P
tampabayrays,353hk5,kimura_snap,2,Thu May 7 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"Lol that's true.  But whats crazy is that the bullpen isn't exactly filled with proven commodities. Boxberger we all expected, but did anyone foresee geltz?? Or Gomes or hell Ramirez.  It'll be even more interesting with McGee."

tampabayrays,34y6wc,underclass4,6,Tue May 5 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Nick Franklin is a better prospect than Tim Beckham (see also: Forsythe/Droobs). We just have to forget that Tim Beckham went 1:1 and see him for what he is. He will probably be a serviceable MLB player, but he's going to be the kind of player that we could easily let walk in the next couple of years to give other players a chance to shine.    I've liked his trip to the Majors last year and this year, though. I just don't see Beckham as a quality everyday player. I hope he proves me so wrong, but I just don't see it.    Lets break it down:    Range (SS/2B):     1) Droobs    2) Beckham    3) Franklin    4) Forsythe    Arm:    1) Beckham (I really like his arm)    2) Droobs     3) Forsythe    4) Franklin    Offense:    1) Lumberjack    2) Droobs    3) Franklin    4) Beckham    Droobs is 29, has a few solid years left in him, possible offensive breakout if we're lucky.    Forsythe is 28, also a few solid years left in him, most consistent offensive producer.    Franklin is 24. All the talk in Seattle the years prior to the trade was about him 'bulking up' and 'adding mass.' It just hasn't stuck, so far. He is very young in terms of 'best years of a baseball players life.' Come to think of it, I could see the Rays giving him the Desmond Jennings treatment if he weren't out of options.    Beckham is 25. Thats right, he's been playing pro ball 6 years. He never filled out, he has had some really unexpected pop in his brief stints in the Majors. He isn't going to continue producing when pitchers start game planning for him. He just doesn't have the plate discipline.    Edit #5 I think if Franklin had options, he'd go down (not because he's the worst player, but because the Rays love to hold players down until they're 25-27 to get the peak productive years of their career), but Beckham has 1 option, so he's probably going back to AAA. I hope he hits the fuckin' weights."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,zeitfalle,3,Thu May 7 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"Building off what /u/mkultra3 said honestly I'd like to see if it's possible to move Beckham into SS and see if he can perform there. Franklin and Forsythe are a great pairing on 2nd. That said, I would much rather have Beckham playing than Cabrera.   Less games played and has very similar or better stats compared to him. Guys in his rookie season as well and giving us some huge run support. Tied for 2nd in RBI's and holds 2nd in home runs. I just think he's better than Cabrera already and he can only go up from here; he just needs play time and experience. But then again I don't know if he would be able to play SS well, but it's a common thing for infielders to adapt to any other infield position."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,Jomowi,2,Tue May 5 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you here. Cabrera was more of a stopgap SS trying to replace the offensive output of Zobrist; however, Forsythe has pretty much done that and Cabrera right now is an empty bat in the lineup. I would actually prefer seeing Franklin improve at SS and get at bats there platooning with Beckham, giving Forsythe the bulk of playing time at 2B.   Cabrera's PT is more about re-establishing value there for next years' free agency. Out of all the players on the Rays, Asdrubal has had some of the most unproductive at bats and is seeing a decline in his hard-hit balls, line drive rate and contact rate while his approach is the same in years past. To me (as an amateur, granted) it means that this is that there wont be a significiant improvement, or if there is, any improvement would probably be worse than league average. It was a good ""buy low"" contract since his peripherals last year appeared like the ones he had in his glory days and it seemed like he had some bad luck; however, it seems things are only getting worse now. But yeah, I'm pretty pessimistic about it and it might be worth giving those at bats to a long-term piece in Franklin."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,mkultra3,1 point,Wed May 6 12:59:16 2015 UTC,"I saw Franklin at SS for the Mariners...he just doesn't have the range to play the position. He's a 2B, and even there his range isn't the greatest.    I doubt we can put any of Cabrera, Forsythe, Beckham, or Franklin in the OF and feel comfortable with it. Then again, I said the same thing about Dustin Ackley and minus his arm, he's solid out there in LF for the Ms."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,zeitfalle,2,Thu May 7 04:25:07 2015 UTC,"If I had to rank the the middle infield spectrum, it would be Forsythe, Franklin then Beckham. The second base situation was supposed to be a platoon between Franklin and Forsythe with Franklin playing RHP. Forsythe has proven he could succeed vs this so I can't have him stop playing everyday. The main issue with Franklin has always been his contact, so I could see an extended rehab assignment (no option) to evaluate him."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,mkultra3,2,Tue May 5 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on Beckham?   Also how would you feel about leaving Franklin in AAA until mid - june, July (depending on the success of Logan and Tim) so he can work on contact."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,bpc34,3,Tue May 5 19:32:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about AB's and repetition, Bex has been serviceable at both MIF positions but obviously needs to go down and get his AB's. idk how long franklin can stay in durham on his rehab assignment or if he has options left to actually be sent down."
tampabayrays,34y6wc,mkultra3,2,Tue May 5 20:12:01 2015 UTC,"I like Bex, but his pitch recognition is nowhere near MLB ready (it doesn't look like he has much of an approach, lots of loose trigger swinging). I'm not sure about the improvments he's made there in the past few years since I haven't really seen him in the minor leagues, and I dont think I've read anything that said that he's made strides there. There's no doubt of his bat speed (reason why he's a first round talent), so that will create power, though I dont think his raw strength developed the way the Rays expected. Without adjustemnts at the plate, he's going to end up striking out 30% of the time, even more.  In terms of Franklin, he's just started his rehab assignment in Durham so he's got at most a month down there. If he's not there yet, the Rays would have to option him (only has one left). I cant see the Rays doing that and would at the very least have him up with the club in a bench role replacing Elmore. But I still see Franklin above Bex in the depth chart both at SS and 2B. In fact, a perfect platoon parter for Franklin would be Beckham."

tampabayrays,34yqtj,obliviously_racist,3,Sat May 9 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue with Vogt was the defense, especially as a catcher where he's playing in Oakland. I know it's hard to appreciate on a surface level, but the success the Rays pitching is experiencing is partially due to Rivera behind the plate in framing, blocking and  coaching."
tampabayrays,34r08w,aresef,15,Sun May 3 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Also stopping in from Baltimore...  There's no other team in the division classy enough to do what Tampa Bay did this weekend. But that's no surprise. Rays/Orioles were my favorite intradivision games because everything between the teams was left on the field. None of the primadonna histrionics  of the two New England teams, nor the straight up thuggery of the Toronto squad. I've watch Tampa vs the Orioles for more than a decade now and I can't remember one intentional HBP or on field tantrum from either squad. It's just good baseball. You guys have an easy team to root for."

Saw the attendance for the games on Friday and Saturday and thought I'd be able to stroll in with my son at 1:30 and find great seats. Didn't work out that way...had to sit way out in right field. Still worth it.  As to the OP's original post...lower priced seats would help fill up some areas of the stadium. But the main issue still remains that the stadium sucks and it's just not easy for a lot of people to get to."
tampabayrays,34r0vu,one80oneday,1 point,Mon May 4 04:05:50 2015 UTC,Some stadiums close the upper levels regularly on weekdays to make it appear fuller and reduce cleaning/service workers. Teams can afford selling first level tickets for $15 each just to fill it all the time. Those seats usually sell ok and are $50+ each.

tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,2,Sun May 3 20:23:40 2015 UTC,Kiermaier is .300 vs lefties. But we never let him face lefties.

tampabayrays,34pxa6,fosh1zzle,3,Sun May 3 20:26:35 2015 UTC,Loney's glove is fiiiiine
tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,3,Sun May 3 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to stick up for Cash here, I get exactly what his thinking was. Nate Karns is not a great starter - he's a 5+ ERA kinda guy. Due to sheer statistical probability he's gonna get some runs of good innings together, but just because he's pitched 5 scoreless doesn't mean he's more likely to pitch scoreless going forward - ultimately he's still the same below average starter.  Ultimately it hasn't worked here, but the thinking is that for the remaining 4 innings in a two run ballgame, the bullpen are more likely to keep you in it than an average AAA starter. It's that kind of unconventional thinking that's often been our secret to success in recent years."
tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,1 point,Sun May 3 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Also, if you scratch the first two innings of the season and Karns has a 2.59 era on the year since then. This ones on Cash. Clearly he was drunk and thought the scoreboard said it was the end of the 50th inning not the end of the 5th."
tampabayrays,34pxa6,BentRods,1 point,Sun May 3 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"And if you scratch all the year until today, Erasmo Ramirez is the best pitcher on the planet. You can't just scratch innings to fit the data around the point you want to make. You assess Karns exactly at the quality he is. That's a 4.76 ERA this year, a 4.50 ERA last year, a career big league 5.33 ERA and a 5.05 ERA in 145 AAA innings last year. IE, not very good."
tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,2,Sun May 3 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"And for the last 30 innings, his era has been in the low 2's, besides even a guy who is a below average starter has his good days, he was throwing the ball well, they should have kept him in there. A starting pitcher is suppose to be the best guy you have that day, only to be taken out when he fails or he's reached his limit, to do the opposite is against the way baseball has always been played."

tampabayrays,34pxa6,BentRods,3,Sun May 3 22:08:16 2015 UTC,I would rather squeeze another inning out of Karns than tax the bullpen before a series against Boston...
tampabayrays,34pxa6,BentRods,2,Sun May 3 20:09:01 2015 UTC,I don't see gomes being a better choice in this situation. I see the logic of your argument but in this situation... Just 66 pitches... I think it was premature. And now we blew through the whole pen and we're fucked if we can get two runs and make it to extras.   I'm not opposed to some experimentation and unconventional tactics but he went a little too far with it today.
tampabayrays,34pxa6,kimura_snap,1 point,Sun May 3 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"By basically any measure around Gomes and Geltz are more likely to give you scoreless innings than Karns, we just got unlucky with it today.  The one thing I definitely agree with is wanting to avoid tiring the pen, but I guess if there's a time you use your relievers it's in a 2 run ballgame."
tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,6,Sun May 3 20:16:47 2015 UTC,Bullpen experiment did not work today at all. Karns could still be pitching.

tampabayrays,34pxa6,millionaremattdavis,2,Sun May 3 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"Friday nights game makes this make even less sense! They're already taxed from 4 innings on Friday night why are we going to ask for 4 more innings? Especially with no day off tomorrow and heading right into Boston? Looks like tomorrow's plan is for Odorizzi to go 9, if not Andriese relieves him and finishes the game."

tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,4,Sun May 3 19:49:06 2015 UTC,Cash has no idea what he's doing today. Still dumbfounded at taking karns out of the game...
tampabayrays,34pxa6,BentRods,4,Sun May 3 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a rookie manager and today it's showing. Hopefully he'll learn from this and avoid making the same mistake in the future."
tampabayrays,34pxa6,yoshimane,5,Sun May 3 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"He might be a rookie manager, but this isn't his first year in the game. Taking a starter out after 5 innings and 60some pitches makes no sense at all."

tampabayrays,34pxa6,colwell25,2,Sun May 3 18:50:22 2015 UTC,Yeah but I think that rate will drop off pretty drastically when he works out the kinks in his swing. The guy did hit .350 at AAA last year.
tampabayrays,34pxa6,Pharaoh10,2,Sun May 3 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a pretty small sample size exacerbated by a really cold streak he's been in the past week or so. Over the season it should even out, but it is pretty painful to watch at the moment."

tampabayrays,34dz8h,one80oneday,15,Thu Apr 30 13:11:30 2015 UTC,I've been watching a lot of out of market games lately on MLB.tv and if it's taught me anything it's that the Rays aren't the only one with an attendance problem. Either that or people just hang out on the concourse and not in actual seats at every other stadium.
tampabayrays,34dz8h,BentRods,7,Thu Apr 30 12:33:30 2015 UTC,April is always a low draw month.  Check again in June and July.  Living in Chicago now I easily see more people in US Cellular Field than at a typical Rays game and compared to the Cubs nobody goes to see the Sox.  That said Rays fans are rolling deep up here in Chicago.  Last year for both the Sox and Cubs series there were TONS of Rays fans in the stands.  It was pretty awesome.

I may be too new to this area to have a good grasp on the situation, but even if they did move to Tampa would attendance really go up? I heard the bucs don't even sell out."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,coreystang85,6,Thu Apr 30 13:26:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with the bucs attendance is piss poor performance on the field for the greater part of a decade mixed with absentee ownership. When the team was winning, that stadium was packed every week and a lot of fun to be at."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,millionaremattdavis,4,Thu Apr 30 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"The Lightning averaged nearly 19000 fans a game this past season. For hockey. In Florida.   Yes, move to Tampa and attendance will get better."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,TheCenterOfEnnui,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:58:02 2015 UTC,"If the stadium were downtown (or anywhere that it wouldn't be a 90-120 minute round trip), I would go to so many games on a whim. Making it to the Trop now is a logistical chore that's difficult to accomplish during the week due to the insane drive."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,LobsterThief,3,Fri May 1 02:42:02 2015 UTC,"I live in Wesley Chapel. Since I moved out here (about 11 years ago) I have not been to a weekday game...not one. Even when I lived in south Tampa, I might go to 1-2 weekday games a year. From where I live? Even a weekend game is a day long affair. Put a stadium downtown and I probably triple the number of games I attend."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Fri May 1 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"Same here man, except I live in spring hill, hernando county, I try to go to as many games as I can, but it's 70 to 90 minutes one way for me, i know i cant speak for everyone here but, Ive met tons of baseball fans (I work at an apartment complex)that would go to games if the stadium was in tampa, I know I would go at least twice as much as I do if it wasn't for that drive."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,C0LL0C0,1 point,Fri May 1 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"This is such a no-brainer...it astounds me that anyone thinks otherwise.   The bottom line though, is that unless this happens within a few years, this team is going to move somewhere else.   Other cities don't seem to have these sorts of issues...the St Pete-Tampa thing hurts this area so much."
tampabayrays,34dz8h,TheCenterOfEnnui,1 point,Fri May 1 04:36:50 2015 UTC,I just made a similar post. I'm in Land O Lakes. Just moved here from Baltimore where I lived 10 minutes from the Inner Harbor and the stadiums.   I have no desire to sit in traffic on that bridge to watch a baseball game.
tampabayrays,34dz8h,superstubb,7,Fri May 1 18:22:35 2015 UTC,The Bucs problems stem from the fact that the team is awful year after year and the ownership doesn't do anything to try and fix it.  The issue with the stadium in St. Pete is that a large number of people over there are retirees from the northeast hence why the place is packed when the Yankees or Boston is in town but comparatively empty for every other series.  Move the stadium to Tampa where you have more homegrown fans and they'll see a boost in attendance for sure.  Nobody wants to take the 90min drive on a Wednesday after work to watch a Tampa vs Seattle game lets be honest.

Other reasons the traffic situation in the Tampa Bay area is getting super shitty especially to and from Tampa growth areas to the stadium. People are not going to drive a hour each way to get to the game. Stay at home and watch the game on TV for free. The seats suck the stadium sucks.

Can't confirm as I took their advice, that and I dont want to drive over the bridge in traffic. But I can tell you the field looks like shit on TV.   The Rays are a good team, but I think the stadium and its location make it hard to want to go see them play. Id be much more inclined to see a game if they were on my side of the Bay."

tampabayrays,34bl8m,sveitthrone,8,Wed Apr 29 21:10:39 2015 UTC,"Leaving this month with a winning record given all the players we have on the DL is nothing short of spectacular.   Entering this seasons, my main question has always been counting on players that were unproven and depth that had been untested. Offensively, we're going to rely on players like Souza Jr., Forsythe, Beckham, Guyer and Kiermaier who are either young rookies or sophomores who could potentially slump. These guys have all either met or exceeded expectations.   The pitching has been great as well given the circumstances. We pitched most of the year with our best 2 starters on the DL (Cobb and Moore) and Smyly who's either #3 or 4 (Archer was #3 entering the season, though he's valuted himself now). But yeah, mentioning Archer, he's been spectacular. With that personality, you can definitely count on some sort of improvement. Talk about someone who's extremely self-aware of himself.   The bullpen has also been great. Last April/May, it was the bullpen implosions that have cost us games, either with Balfour or Peralta. The Boxey/Jepsen/Geltz (omg Geltz, he's a strikeout machine as well) have been excellent. Frieri has been good but not great, and Gomes has now cemented himself as a great GB length guy, transforming himself from a ROOGY to good arm. But yeah, having several arms you can count on in the pen is something that we need.    Other notes:    Defense has been great.  Forsythe has been highly underrated this year. Talk about a Ben Zobrist replacement -- this might be him. Great eye at the plate (walk in two runs this month), great line drive power and great defense at 2B while being able to play 1st and 3rd.  Jennings and Cabrera lead the players who need to improve. Jennings has looked pretty good, just unlucky at the plate (nice line drive power, just all to batters in the OF). Cabrera, on the other hand, has not. He needs to pick it up at the plate, pronto. Rivera looks great behind the plate. For some reason, his catch-and-throw has been meh towards the end of the month but he teased us before. I think he can pick it up at the plate too, but he's been rather unproductive with RISP. Longo will improve with Loney in the lineup.      Looking forward:  So, players who are about to get off the DL sometime in May are (in order I think): Alex Colome, McGee, Nick Franklin, Ryan Brett and finally Alex Cobb (possibly Refienhauser by the end of the month as well).  This means that there will have to be players removed from the roster. Here's what I could see happening:   Alex Colome - Matt Andriese gets optioned back to Durham. This would set the rotation of Archer, Karns, Odorizzi, Smyly, Colome. McGee - Tough one. The easy thing to do would be to option Geltz since he has options, but I could see the Rays DFA Ramirez as well.  Franklin - Elmore gets DFA, sent to Durham. His return really makes the 2B situation a little interesting, since I think Forsythe has proven himself as an everyday guy at this point. I bet Franklin gets a lengthy rehab stint.  Brett - Optioned back to Durham. Cobb - Another tough one. If Colome looks effective as a starter, I think that Karns gets optioned to Durham and Colome stays in the rotation. If not, then Colome would have to shift to the bullpen and move someone else out. At this point, if Ramirez is still on the team, I could see him being DFAd. I could also see Geltz optioned to Durham. Man, after this month we will most likely see Geltz in AAA. That's sad :(   But yeah, injuries to others will completely change all of this. Just me speculating."
tampabayrays,34bl8m,mkultra3,3,Wed Apr 29 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"given all the players we have on the DL is nothing short of spectacular.   That's been the most impressive part of this year so far. New manager, lots of injuries, people thought we'd flounder from the get-go. I'm cautiously optimistic, but you'd think by now people would quit underestimating us."
tampabayrays,34bl8m,colwell25,4,Wed Apr 29 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Was gonna write something lengthy but couldn't have put it better than mkultra3 did. I jjust want to touch on how impressed I've been with Cash's transition into management at such a young age. He seems to have retained Joe's excellent clubhouse vibe and the principles built on hard work and hustle, but left out a little of the over-management that eventually drove some of our fans nuts. His use of the bullpen has been almost revolutionary - that may sound reactive but I really think the idea of platooning the closer role is one that will catch on. It gives such faith to the 'lesser' members of the pen who are being trusted to close games out (which creates an overall better bullpen unit) but also how often have you felt that an 8th inning vs 3,4,5 was a higher leverage inning than the 9th vs 6,7,8?  Very happy with what we've seen and I hope it continues!"
tampabayrays,34bl8m,kimura_snap,2,Wed Apr 29 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'm feeling pretty good so far. Cash has been surprisingly aggressive and that's a welcome change.  I think the biggest surprise for me were the bats. We're averaging 4 runs a game right now, and most of them have come in just a few games. That tells me that we have the potential to pop off on a fairly regular basis, and might be the needed support our rotation needs. Glad to see Longo sitting around .300, even if it is the first month of the year. Keirmaier's been clutch early on, and I'm loving it."
tampabayrays,34br1i,CooperEarly,3,Wed Apr 29 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"Lets try and get at least Longo, Keimaier, and Loney in"

They'll bat first, won't have walkup music, no celebratory music or horns after big hits or home runs... I'm tempted to go just to experience the weird feeling of being ""guests"" at their own house.

tampabayrays,346ndp,stinkypenny,2,Wed Apr 29 13:45:25 2015 UTC,Any word on how tickets are going to work?
tampabayrays,346ndp,sveitthrone,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"On our end, it's complicated for the White Sox series and what have you. But on your end, it appears you can buy tickets online as if it were any other game."
tampabayrays,346ndp,sveitthrone,4,Tue Apr 28 19:12:08 2015 UTC,Yeah but a lot of times with these moves they deeply discount tickets and the Rays don't sell well As it is so I'm curious
tampabayrays,346ndp,stinkypenny,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:19:38 2015 UTC,15 bucks general admission from what I have seen.
tampabayrays,346ndp,pvdfan,2,Wed Apr 29 13:47:29 2015 UTC,Anyone hear about how to get tickets for these games?
tampabayrays,346ndp,A_guy_in_scrubs,3,Tue Apr 28 21:32:24 2015 UTC,They appear to be available on Rays website.
tampabayrays,346ndp,A_guy_in_scrubs,2,Tue Apr 28 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Really?  Could you link it, if you don't mind.  Only Rangers and Yankees are coming up for me."
tampabayrays,346ndp,heyitsmejosh,3,Tue Apr 28 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"At the top of the Rays homepage, where it lists the next game and ticket opportunities, click the button to keep going to the right and you come to our first game against y'all."
tampabayrays,346ndp,TweetPoster,3,Tue Apr 28 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"Trying now and it only gives ""Preview"" as an option. Checked StubHub and it appears that the tickets don't exist there either."
tampabayrays,346ndp,TallyTime,3,Tue Apr 28 22:02:27 2015 UTC,Well fuck. Maybe they're still trying to work the kinks out. Wait for Rays twitter to tell you what's up.
tampabayrays,346ndp,TallyTime,5,Tue Apr 28 22:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even checked the O's site - No way to get the tickets right now it seems."
tampabayrays,346ndp,TallyTime,2,Tue Apr 28 22:07:40 2015 UTC,"Tickets go on sale tomorrow at noon, per Rays twitter."
tampabayrays,345ct6,NosyargKcid,3,Tue Apr 28 12:54:07 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks!"

tampabayrays,343bzp,Krapul,2,Tue Apr 28 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"Dewayne* but yeah, absolutely"
