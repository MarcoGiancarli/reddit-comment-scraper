gatech,3e5mzs,30332,2,Wed Jul 22 03:32:36 2015 UTC,Look into GIT MAD and the App Lab. They provide access to Macs that you should be able to develop on. http://www.ccorgs.com/orgs/gitmad
gatech,3e5mzs,Lupac,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the App Lab is what you're looking for. The library doesn't install Xcode on their machines, and the CoC has pretty much phased out generally-accessible computer labs."
gatech,3e5mzs,russianzilla,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:27:44 2015 UTC,"Apple Swift language program? Aka Xcode that comes with every Mac.  And no, regardless of whether you want to use Swift or Objective-C, if you want to do iOS development and publish to App Store, you must have a Mac.  There are some alternatives to that, I heard that Xamarin is getting better and better every day with cross-platform mobile app development, but nothing is better than native, and you must use C# instead of Swift for that."
gatech,3e5mzs,Filoleg94,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:28:01 2015 UTC,Why not write it in objective-c?
gatech,3e5mzs,McMalloc,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:10:58 2015 UTC,"I once sat down to try and get an idea of how to code in Objective-C. I spent maybe 15 minutes on it, which is 15 minutes I should've spent on basically anything else. I don't know how they ended up with such a bastardized C derivative, but I'm glad they created Swift to eventually replace it."
gatech,3e5mzs,russianzilla,-1,Wed Jul 22 05:30:17 2015 UTC,No.  And you wouldn't want to take it if you did.  The language is two years old.  You'll learn more from fooling around with it yourself and using apples developer videos than you will from a prof.
gatech,3e5oei,apzach,8,Wed Jul 22 03:45:29 2015 UTC,Did you expect economics to be in the college of engineering?
gatech,3e5oei,McMalloc,3,Wed Jul 22 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like I can provide some insight into this being an IAC student.  IAC makes up a very small percentage of Tech students. It's weird being in such a small group, but in allows for great connection with professors, smaller classes, and you become close friends with people in your major because you have most of the same classes together. I have made so many close friends because we share common interests. We can talk about current events and global topics in an academic manner. (No offense, but some of y'all engineering majors don't even know where Yemen is.)  There are so many opportunities to build your resume and network with alumni. If you work hard, participate in professional clubs, network, and get internships, you will have no problem finding a job or getting into grad school.   From my personal experience, I switched to INTA from MSE at the end of my first year. In my first year of being an INTA major I studied abroad, brought my GPA up, got my dream internship, and work as a part-time research assistant on projects I'm very passionate about. I'm not saying all this to brag. I'm saying this to show that you aren't missing out on any opportunities by studying Econ. at an engineering school. I know there is one INTA professor (Jeffrey Borowitz) who studied Econ at MIT (coincidentally, his wife studied AE at MIT and is now an INTA professor as well) and I believe he works on some projects about the economics of human trafficking and big data.   TL;DR-a liberal arts degree is very valuable. It's still a BS and you are not losing anything by studying Econ at a predominately engineering university. PM if you want to know more or have any specific questions"
gatech,3e5oei,jewgineer,2,Wed Jul 22 06:20:09 2015 UTC,"No employers asks what college you were in. You're getting a degree in economics not a degree in liberal arts.  On a separate note, non-traditional IAC majors (stac, hts, ...) suffer in relation to how far away from and how well known Tech is to the potential employer. The degrees don't read that well on paper."
gatech,3e5oei,upwut,2,Wed Jul 22 04:27:38 2015 UTC,Economics isn't usually considered a liberal arts degree. Most university econ degrees are through business schools.
gatech,3e5oei,theshamespearofhurt,2,Wed Jul 22 04:34:44 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I've noticed that our IAC is well-respected. Empirically, all of my friends in IAC, including a few Econ majors, have not had problems in acquiring jobs or entering graduate school, but the defining factor in their ability to get jobs/grad school is high academic achievement. The most important thing is that you do WELL. A 3.5 GPA in Econ from GT is better than a 1.5 GPA from Harvard."
gatech,3e5oei,sulfurous,3,Wed Jul 22 04:18:43 2015 UTC,It'd be a real challenge to get a 1.5 at Harvard with their grade inflation these days.

gatech,3e5oei,Muirbequ,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"I can't really give you subjective information as I am just a Freshman. However, a quick google search for Economics programs rankings shows GaTech in the 50-75 range worldwide. One ranks the Economics Master program as the top 18 nationally. (I'm on mobile otherwise I'd post sources, but they're the first few Google results.)   Sure, it's not top 10 like Engineering or CS, but I'd say that reputation-wise you won't have any problems. Especially if you want to work in the South, where GaTech's name is quite strong."
gatech,3e5oei,erebon,2,Wed Jul 22 04:31:53 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want to do with it. Combine Econ with a solid minor/concentration like math or CS and you're pretty set.  Oh, and make good grades, like the other guy said."

I never felt like I got any advantage with the cs version and the projects only made things more stressful for an already difficult class.  As for changing things around phase 2, it's definitely possible. Check out http://coursemon.ccostes.com/ , you can set alerts for classes that you need although I seem to remember it wasn't working last time I tried to use it so don't rely on it fully."
gatech,3e5dz1,IAmA_Turtl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:24:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, they said they were changing Calc to a four part class instead of 3,and since I had to take linear separate that would make it like 5 haha"
gatech,3e5dz1,russianzilla,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:35:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, so let's get a few quick things out of the way. First, CS 1100 is very, very easy. Seriously, just show up to class so you get the attendance points, do your journal entries and homework, and you'll be fine. No sweat.  CS 1331 doesn't have a lab. That 90-minute period you're seeing is a recitation. If you're coming from a school that didn't do recitation, think of it as a review period. It's led by your TA(s), and they generally go over material from the week, answer questions, etc. Granted, I took the class in 2012, but I doubt much has changed. Again, no sweat.  Now, your biggest issue (understandably so) is that you have a pretty crappy MWF load. I'm not too familiar with INTA 2050, but as far as Health goes, it's not so much that it's difficult, as that the tests are just really picky about facts, so you'll have to make sure to take good notes, study meticulously, etc. It looks like for this semester, you'll have to choose either MW, WF, or double length on Friday. I don't know that I'd be able to pay attention in Health for two hours, but the choice is yours.  As for having calc and CS 1331 on the same days... well, you can't really do anything about that. ¯\(ツ)/¯  tl;dr: You'll be fine. Welcome to Tech! You're in for a hell of a ride."
gatech,3e2xo4,bjgbob,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Unsure how I feel about this.  It doesn't affect me personally at all, and while I don't see any huge downsides to the registration bumps (most events that you're getting classroom space for you know days in advance, most outdoor events you know weeks in advance, etc.), I also don't see why they're necessary.  Solid meh.  Is anyone actually very adversely affected by this?  Clubs and orgs are inconvenienced a tad but not a whole lot."
gatech,3e2xo4,Josh_Morton,4,Tue Jul 21 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm just happy they're even bothering to lay things out in advance instead of suddenly canceling events and sending us emails saying we're kicked out of <insert building here> because ""reasons"".  As for the changes specifically...meh. I don't see them fixing any issue we've ever had (or given to CPSM) but they don't appear to be presenting any difficulties to orgs. For the new 3 weeks notice rule, what was it originally?"
gatech,3e2xo4,embeddedGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 22:34:48 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. The current system in place seemed to be functioning just fine. 3 weeks in advance seems like a bit much. I also don't think extending the info table request from 5 to 7 days will help much.   I wasn't aware of any previous issues, but maybe there were some. Just seems rather unnecessary from an outsider's perspective."
gatech,3e2xo4,jewgineer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:17 2015 UTC,Sorry if this is stupid slash I just want to clarify but does this mean we will have to book CULC rooms 72 hours in advance for studying (the ones that say INSTANT RESERVATION)?
gatech,3e2xo4,lalaninatl,2,Tue Jul 21 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I think those spaces are controlled by the library rather than by CPSM, so that should remain the same unless the library also makes a new policy."

Actually this is not a requirement of a Giffen good in general."
gatech,3e3ezl,GameTheoryGuy,4,Wed Jul 22 01:17:07 2015 UTC,"If a Giffen good was a normal good, then the sub effect would cause a decrease in consumption and the income effect would further decrease consumption. The Giffen good is so inferior that the income effect essentially overrides the the substitution effect. Maybe you're confusing this with a Veblen good (luxury items)."
gatech,3e3ezl,xanakinskywalker,-4,Wed Jul 22 01:40:29 2015 UTC,"As a normal good, it is not required that there be a substitute for it. And income works quite different when you think about being endowed in units of certain goods. I don't think you have been through a graduate level theory class."

To attend a top-ten US school, you'd want to get a SAT score in the ~90% percentile, which is typically around 2000 points.  Your high school classmates were likely hoping to attend a highly-ranked US university.  Hence, why they regarded scores below 2000 to be 'terrible.'"

However, since the score requirement for 1310 is higher than that of 1211k, I don't think you can exempt from one and then substitute. You'll probably have to take one.  As for MSE, yes 1310 is a prereq, but if you can sub 1211k for 1310 then that carries through as your prereq (ie, you wouldn't then have to take 1310 as well). As an ME, you only have one chem requirement.   Honestly, I think you'll have to take one. And it's a good idea to have a refresher at a college level before taking MSE. MSE will help a lot in both DefBods and Manufacturing, as well as some others I've forgotten. 1310 is a sucky class and the only one I've gotten a C in, but if you get a good foundation in that, you'll be set."

But like others have said, it's strongly recommended to do a thesis if you're planning on going into a PhD program. It gives you research and writing experience and it means that you'll have a research adviser that can teach you and possibly write you a recommendation letter.

You can log a device into GT Other through another device so I found it works fairly reliably if log my laptop into GT Other on my phone using my laptops MAC address (go to network preferences -> advanced and its at the bottom labeled Wi-Fi Address). Log in your laptop from your phone/another computer and then restart your computer and connect. If the connection drops for some reason for your own sanity do not waste your time trying to get it to just reconnect. Restart your computer, then try to reconnect. I've had a near 0% success rate without restarting my computer when trying to re-connect when I had a connection that was dropped. If you live in campus housing, when you don't need to be wireless use an ethernet cable instead of trying to connect to the wifi. Just plug it in and go to start.gatech.edu and register your laptop. Takes like 5 minutes and I haven't had any problems with having to restart or whatever when using it. If you update the El Capitan beta after you've registered your laptop using the wired connection, you may have to delete your old registration and re-register to make it work properly. Use Safari with any anti-virus plug-ins you may have disabled instead of Chrome if you're trying to connect to the GT Other login screen on your laptop. Then after you login use can use whatever."

I picked it because I wanted a college experience with professors who cared, an appropriate balance between academic rigor and feasible success, and great career opportunities.   Honest advice: do ME. You like discovery, and ME's with a desire to do the business side of things are rare."

I came in undeclared, and had to declare a major since I pretty much already had all of the common credits taken care of. I was told ME was a generic degree that has a lot of potential, so I went with it. Well they were right, as an ME I can study a wide variety of things. As for liking the business aspect of working, I know a lot of other ME's who are going to work on the more business-ey side of engineering. Personally, by becoming an ME I gave myself more time to figure out the specifics of what I want to do without sacrifice any potential for doing it. I am going for my masters here via the bsms program, so essentially I started out just knowing I like math and science, and will end up doing a lot of research on something that over time I figured out I liked working in by experience. Also ASME is a thing, where the meetings are essentially companies giving you lunch(or breakfast haha) to listen to them talk about their company and what it's like working for them. Ultimately it's up to you but I would recommend ME without a doubt.  tldr:  I'd recommend ME bc:  --You have options.       The ME field is pretty encompassing and bc of this you can slowly figure out what you want to do and experiment with working in slightly different fields within ME. This includes not only classes but also internship and research opportunity.  -- You can do business stuff as ME.  I don't know this from experience however other ME's I know have told me they'd be working more business-type jobs.  --Perks  Such as ASME, the ME career fair and the most common engineering major means the largest campus student population to get advice from."

The safest area where a tech student can live is either on campus, where you have actual security and gated buildings, or in a gated community somewhere a little bit further from campus.   I lived in a place about a 10 minute drive north of campus that was gated and mostly older people living there, and there were literally 0 crimes that happened in that area. That is a safe area. Not home park.  I'm not just trashing home park - I lived there myself for a year and nothing happened.

gatech,3dtrwp,gtguy1234,2,Mon Jul 20 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"Not to go all Freakonomics on this, but it's likely due to the fact that there are actually things in Atlanta worth stealing. Because Atlanta has many nice areas in combination with the poverty, criminals are able to get a far better return on the time invested into carrying out property theft. Somewhere like Baltimore doesn't have the volume of middle-class inhabitants living within city limits to steal from - you're just far less likely to score a brand new iPhone from holding someone up on the street in Baltimore.  The actual act of getting held up at gunpoint and getting your phone and wallet stolen is terrifying, but in the end, new credit cards come in the mail 2 days later and you go to the store and buy a new phone, even if it's not as nice as the one you had before.  For the crimes of Murder and Rape, however, someone can't just get over it and move on... and for these categories, Atlanta's rate is approximately half that of Baltimore, so it's really no comparison."
gatech,3dtrwp,McMalloc,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:00:43 2015 UTC,"so it's really no comparison.   Your kindergarten, evidence-free theory aside, murder and rape are incredibly rare crimes. I've never heard of a GT student getting murdered, ever. I know of 1 instance of rape, and it's a college campus so that's going to happen regardless of the city.  Like I already said, the crimes that actually do affect GT students are all more common in Atlanta. The guy I responded to was acting like it was ridiculous for someone to be worried about crime in Atlanta, which is just stupid. Atlanta is a very high crime city."
gatech,3dtrwp,gtguy1234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"It does make sense based on background knowledge that many people have about key traits of both Atlanta and Baltimore... I said it was likely, but it's not like I've done detailed research into it.  Even though the crimes you're referring to are more common in Atlanta, the other thing that's also more common in Atlanta is the types of people that these types of crimes are typically perpetrated against. The auto theft stat is through the roof for Atlanta, but the number of nice cars to steal here is also far higher. Same idea would apply to the other categories too.  Also, calling an idea 'kindergarten' is not usually considered a good way to disagree with someone because it detracts from the counter-argument you're trying to make. A more reasonable approach to prove my idea wrong would have been to present some data to the contrary (for example, if there were data showing that Baltimore has a higher percentage of middle class than Atlanta, that would have been a good way to demonstrate that it it's not because criminals are motivated by better things to steal in Atlanta)."
gatech,3dtrwp,McMalloc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"I did present the data. I showed how the crimes that affect students are more common in Atlanta, and all you responded with was speculation and bs. You provided nothing to back up your claims.  Also, the stuff you're saying makes no sense anyway. If there were more poor people in Baltimore and fewer middle class people, there might be fewer to steal from; but, there would also be more people to do the stealing. Without any data, it's unwise to speculate about the resultant effect.   Lastly, you assumed that only nice cars get stolen, which is not remotely true. The most stolen cars are all cheap, old, used cars. See what happens when you actually do 5 seconds of research before making claims?"

It's true tho, double yellow dotted is hard to play because you gotta hit it hard to make it bounce, and it's also really good for control, so if you're not experienced enough and don't have the stamina, you'll have a hard time playing the game. Blue dot is really fast, real bouncy, which makes playing easy but it really goes flying everywhere - much like how a racket ball is lol, so maybe that's why blue dotted categorized as beginner's ball. _^  The single yellow dot is kinda in between and that's why I like it. I speak from experience, ya know?

Living in a slightly smaller room and paying slightly more. You know what will make you miserable? Living with someone you don't know who turns out to be awful in some unforeseen way; surprisingly, people don't tell you about all their awful qualities until you move in. You probably also won't like having to sit on the bus for 40 minutes every day, if not longer, given Atlanta traffic. Said traffic isn't all that hospitable to cyclists either, at least for any sizable commute (and 20 minutes on a bike in the summer heat in Atlanta is pretty awful too).  If you're going to be student here, you will probably become involved in campus social life. Living walking distance to campus is absolutely huge in terms of doing things with other people here - especially spontaneous, fun things that can't happen if you're 20 minutes away. Good housemates can have a big impact on that too - if you know these two guys are awesome, that's absolutely enough regardless of anything else to go with them.

If it's walking distance to campus, it's probably walking distance to Peachtree St., which has a ton of great restaurants and things to do. I don't know what Loring Heights has, but it's probably not that. If it's living in an old house versus an apartment, consider the possibility of cockroaches and bed bugs, which would be way more like in the former. I've lived in several old houses, and lemme tell you, cockroaches suck.  I could probably keep going but I think you get the gist of it. If you have any specific questions to ask about places/areas, feel free to ask - I've been at Tech 5.5 years now, I've lived everywhere from campus to Home Park to Marietta; I've biked, walked, commuted on MARTA, and driven to campus for various semesters."

gatech,3do2vi,kks1236,2,Wed Jul 22 06:20:59 2015 UTC,Do you recommend Surface for note-taking in the class?
gatech,3do2vi,opkode,3,Sat Jul 18 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"I have the original Surface Pro.  It's great for note-taking, but I feel like the Surface Pro 3 would be better (obviously it wasn't out when I bought mine).  The Surface Pro 3 is great because it has a much nicer screen than mine and you have more options for disk space, RAM, and CPU.  I'd say that if you can become familiar with OneNote or a similar software, digital note-taking can be a huge help.  It's amazing how easy note-taking is for math/engineering classes when you can move shit around and copy/paste from other sources and not waste time erasing or rewriting shit."
gatech,3do2vi,PubicFishing,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"I have the surface pro 3. I still prefer taking notes on paper, but the stylus on it is really impressive. It's also able to handle matlab and Adobe illustrator just fine. I haven't tied heavier stuff like CAD/FEM yet, but I think I'll vlab in for that. I'd highly recommend it, I love mine. And op, I don't think I've ever carried more than like 1 textbook at a time in undergrad. The most common bags I see around campus are either (1) simple Herschel/Jansport bags or (2) those bags with the Swiss flag on them (Wenger or victorinox brand I think?). I've used both types and recommend either."
gatech,3do2vi,nagas_noillib,0,Sat Jul 18 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"The Surface is excellent for in-class note-taking.  The pen is great, and it feels natural to write.

gatech,3do2vi,MontagneHomme,2,Sat Jul 18 17:43:51 2015 UTC,Can confirm. LL Bean is about as cheap as they come and they just don't break. I had the same one from elementary until I finished high school. I mostly got a new one before Tech because it all the fabric had gotten too caked with stuff that wouldn't wash out.  My newer LL Bean is still tough and has lots of space but also has some nice carrying handles. It also has a bottom pocket which -alone- can carry a weekend worth of clothes. Actually been very useful on numerous occasions. More of a parachute style fabric though so much lighter than my old one but probably a bit easier to rip. Would still totally recommend.

gatech,3do2vi,Willard37,7,Fri Jul 17 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"5-subject binder (or individual binders/notebooks) to separate notes for each class. It is very useful to have notes for each class in easy-to-access, chronological order. Organization is key to success. I recommend taking written notes over typing them; there are various studies showing that this is more effective, e.g. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/ Another alternative is a ""smart pen"" that automatically uploads notes to the cloud, but it's up to you as to whether that's necessary. Textbooks, if needed (generally not needed for the actual lecture, but good to bring to recitation or office hours if you have a question about a specific problem in the book. A folder to store loose pieces of paper (sylllabi, handouts, homework/assignments to turn in, etc.) - along with a copious supply of blank paper! Your preferred type of writing utensil. I prefer pens because they leave darker marks and are less likely to smudge. Just scratch out mistakes - erasing is likely to smear and even tear the paper (especially if you are frustrated with attempting a problem several times and failing!) A printout of your class schedule, until you memorize the times/locations. Beats having to frantically check OSCAR on your phone and hope that your wifi/4G signal and login work. A calculator. It depends on what type of calculators are allowed (mostly on exams) This one got me through the majority of undergrad: http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-MultiView-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B000PDFQ6K For some classes, you may need a more advanced graphing or financial calculator, but this should be made clear by the instructor. Non-perishable food (granola bar, etc). You never know when you're going to be in the library/CULC/etc. studying for several hours, and having a snack on hand is always good. Vending machines tend to be expensive. A water bottle, if you have a feasible way to store it in your backpack. Staying hydrated is important, and you're more likely to drink water if you don't have to walk to a water fountain.  A jacket/sweater/etc. (even in summer!) to compensate for the random room that has turbocharged A/C. I have experienced this before, and it is rather unpleasant. Your laptop, if you do work on it, although generally you can get by with your home computer, computer labs, and shared network drives. Chargers for any electronics (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.). You never know how long you're going to end up studying... A flash drive, in case you need to transfer files on short notice. A short ruler - if you're writing a homework assignment that requires some sort of plot/graph, straight lines make things much neater. And as a former grader, neat, easy-to-read papers are more likely to get a higher grade (since if I can't read your answer, I'm generally going to take points off). A portable stapler. Please do not turn in multi-page assignments that are not stapler. The TA/grader will hate you. Also, you'll be able to help out classmates that were not thoughtful enough to staple their work."

I've learned more from reading blogs and books than I did in classes, which mostly focused on the pricing of securities and only lightly touched on portfolios, risk management, markets.

OR is focused on all the heaviest mathematical parts of ISyE - complex optimization models, advanced stochastic analysis, deep probability and statistics theory, etc. There are obviously many many ISyE careers based on optimization and mathematical modeling, but these kinds of jobs are filled by people who A) are all really good at this stuff and B) usually have a masters or PhD in ISyE/OR/Applied Math."

Full disclosure: I came from the 15inch FHD (inspiron 7520) which was really nice, although heavy and after 2 years of continuous use the battery was pretty dead. Anyway, I'm not sure what to think of the xps 13. I'm on it right now and there are a bunch of things nagging me: 13,3 is small, even on the FHD version (especially if you're looking to do side-by-side document editing and such, which was great on the 7520). Scaling in windows is absolutely bogus, 100% is WAY to small on 13 inch so you are going to have to scale, with all it's negative side effects included (artifacts and such, 3rd party apps). Touchpad was very very good on the 7520; the new xps has an annoying input lag that feels like a serious downgrade.

Two main reasons: The screen is quite small, If you're gonna be using any kind of development environment it's not gonna be comfortable. And second, the keyboard is awful. If you're planning on spending some time on a laptop coding/writing papers, you want to look for a better keyboard"

gatech,3dp602,straightoutofATL,2,Sat Jul 18 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"After my first year, I actually really recommend a surface pro, even more so if you have a separate desktop. It's really convenient and allows you to digitize all your notes.  The macbook air is a bit weak overall, but should have no real struggle with the college workload. It has great battery life, but unless you want to go without a charger, then it shouldn't matter that much as many of the classrooms/lecture halls have outlets for you to use."
gatech,3dp602,myu42996,6,Sat Jul 18 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"I dont understand how the macbook air is weak if the surface is enough. Say we look at i7/8gb/256gb ssd: the macbook air will have a newer processor (5650u vs 4650u), better graphics (hd6000 vs hd5000), faster ssd performance and better battery life. Its even 100 dollars cheaper. Only weakness is the screen imo."
gatech,3dp602,shred45,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"Really, neither is suited to computational usage, but for a college laptop that's not necessary. Furthermore, the MBA has to be compared against other fullsized laptops.   The difference in processor will be negligible during use and is just attributed to the MBA being newer. Yes the HD6000 series is better, but TBH if gaming performance matters beyond a simple game of league, CSGO, etc, which both can easily handle, then you're looking at the wrong laptop. Both use SSD based storage, and their differences in speed will not be noticed at all considering how much the other ports still bottleneck SSD throughput. Yeah the MBA has better battery life, but again, full-sized laptop (also the newer processor helps). I only had a 7-8 hour battery life and I don't think there was a day I ever came close to my laptop dying when I needed it.   Personally, the MBA screen is atrocious. I mean 900p on a 13.3"" display in 2015? Granted, Apple is better with display scaling that MS, but still.   The big reason why I recommend the SP is because of the touchscreen and the digitizer. Yeah sure, you can type your notes for plenty of classes with a regular laptop. But when it comes to classes like math and physics, being able to digitally WRITE, not just type, helps immensely. Only having to bring around a tablet and pen makes moving around much easier. It also makes sure you always have your notes in one consolidated area."
gatech,3dp602,myu42996,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think both are very competant machines, short of CAD programs, I have never had an issue and wished for a faster machine.   The difference in generations is not negligible. No matter what you attribute it to, they still directly compete. As seen here:  http://www.notebookcheck.net/Broadwell-vs-Haswell-Duel-of-the-ULV-Processors.138010.0.html  The exact SKU's that I mentioned earlier are not in these tests, but you can that across the range of processors there is tangible performance improvements with the newer generation. The same can be said for graphics performance. Which, by the way, is not only useful during gaming.   Both use SSD, yes, but the Macbook Air uses PCIe, while the surface uses mSATA. Most mSATA drives max out at 500 MB/s read, whilst PCIe can see upwards of 1200 MB/s. I could not find super reliable benchmarks for the surface pro, but this site does have disk benchmarks ( I dont know how it was measured ) for both machines and shows that the Macbook Air is TWICE as fast. Thats a big deal   http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/tablets/microsoft-surface-3  http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/apple-macbook-air-13-early-2015  I dont know how you mean ""other ports will bottleneck SSD throughput"", it provides real benefites when loading data off of disk, including opening programs, and ports have nothing to do with it.   Perhaps you can go through a whole day on one charge with the Surface, but the fact that the Macbook Air can average another 2-3 hours of real life battery time is a big deal. Maybe you forgot to charge one night or you go on a long trip. Maybe you are doing really CPU intensive stuff one day and you need that extra juice just to make it the full day.   I think it is unfair to compare the Macbook Air to a ""Full size laptop"" and the Surface to a tablet only. A full sized laptop brings a 14-15"" machine to mind. The Macbook Air is firmly in the ultrabook category and the Surface is very large for a tablet. The surface is lighter and thinner, but that does not include any keyboard case. They are both quite unnoticeable in a backpack.   The screen is bad, but it is still pretty dense for a 13"" screen. 3 years ago when it was first introduced, that resolution was the same as the 15"" MBP. It's not like you cant read it.   I think the touchscreen/digitizer is cool, but that is much more of a subjective advantage. I would argue that the full size keyboard of the Macbook Air makes it MUCH better for taking notes, because I can type much faster than I can write and the notes will be much more legible. Learning LaTeX can make writing equations pretty easy, but I admit that I just use pen and paper still, as do most of the people I see in classes.   I think the Surface Pro is super cool, and I would totally have one if I had the disposable income, but claiming that that the MBA is much weaker than it and not a good laptop for students is absurd and does a great disservice to OP. He should see if he likes the style of using both (taking notes on the touchscree, using the kickstand vs. typing on a more conventional laptop)."
gatech,3dp602,shred45,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that in the use that he'll probably use the computer, the increase in CPU processing power won't make much of a difference, not that the newer one isn't more powerful.   Yes, the MBA uses PCIe, but again, the mSATA drive is plenty fast enough for booting and opening programs, especially when compared to an HDD. Other than that, the speed only really matters when transferring to other storage mediums, which will probably have much lower writes speeds than either drive's read speeds.  I meant comparing the MBA as a full-sized laptop as in that it had a full chassis and a larger form factor, making it easier to fit more within.  The resolution's pretty low and doesn't give you as much pixel real-estate, I didn't mean that it was unreadable.  Overall you make a very solid argument, but I think my point boils down to that there is a minimal increase in real-world performance, and I'd personally much rather have that touchscreen/digitizer, which like you said is a subjective advantage, but IMO a very important one."
gatech,3dp602,myu42996,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"So to clarify, you are saying that the macbook air is a weak choice, despite being more performant in every way than the surface pro, because that extra performance isnt needed when taking notes in class and you want a touch screen.   Why not get an ipad or android tablet? There are force sensitive styluses available for those, they are MUCH smaller, and cost way less.   What happens when OP has to do some programming assignment, or anything that involves typing for long periods of time. What happens when OP has to do that one (inevitable) CAD project? Presumably OP wants this to last 4-5 years, just the fact that the surface is one chipset generation behind is a huge argument against it in terms of longevity. Im sure the surface pro 4 will remedy the situation but it isnt out yet.   A lot of your arguments involve qualifications ( compared to a hdd. Who would even consider that?) and hand waving (minimal increase in real world performance. That is bold considering that broadwell generally offers 15% better cpu and gpu performance with  30% less power consumption).   Were talking about two GOAT laptops here. Neither is a clear winner."
gatech,3dp602,shred45,2,Sat Jul 18 17:44:51 2015 UTC,"I never said the macbook was a weak choice, I just said it lacks over computing power, which the SP3 does as well. You keep saying it has a higher performance, which it does, but it will not be appreciable during use. And I recommend the SP over standard tablets because it offers a fully-fledged OS. For programming, both the SP and MBA are powerful enough. Typing: I've used the type cover and it's actually a pretty decent keyboard. CAD: Not like the MBA would fair much better, but yes the MBA would have the edge in this case, but again, neither would be really suited for that workload. And with the generation thing, yes and no. Yeah the processors get slightly better each year, but overall won't be an issue. I'm not too sure about the advances in mobile CPUs, but I know the 2000 series of intel desktop CPUs are still plenty capable despite being 3 generations old.   And yes, like I said the newer CPU will have greater performance. In the benchmark you linked, the maximum performance gap in Cinebench is 12%. Now I HIGHLY doubt OP will be using anything that intense. Web-browsing and office are not CPU heavy at all and the greater performance of the CPU will not be used, and even if the CPU performance is that large of a deal to OP, he shouldn't be looking at either of these anyway.  Moving stuff within a drive merely changes the location for the user, the actual information stays in the same sectors, meaning the higher speed of the PCIe SSD will only be realized when moving data from one drive to another. So unless you regularly copy large portions onto another drive that is equally fast, the PCIe SSD won't make a difference. Even then, chances are in that case the port you use (USB is most probable) will more likely than not bottleneck both an mSATA and a PCIe SSD.   I'm not sure why you discredit real world performance. Sure larger numbers are great, but if they don't translate to actual real-world performance for what OP is going to use it for, then they mean nothing to him.  Again, my point is, I value the touchscreen/digitizer of the SP over the performance ""gain"" of the MBA. If computing performance matters, OP shouldn't be looking at either of these."

gatech,3dgn17,golden_light_above_u,29,Thu Jul 16 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"So, both of my parents are GT alum, and a while back (read a few months) I had them write down some of their memories. Not to steal your thunder, but I thought this'd be a cool place to share.  My father started in '77 and my mother attended or worked for GT until the mid 1980s, so between them there's a good bit of history.  Both were computer science majors at the time that CS was just beginning to be a thing.  Here's an edited version of what they had to say:  Dad:  I started at GT in Fall 1976 – almost 40 years ago.  Information and Computer Science (ICS) was a school (not a college).  ICS, campus-wide computing and administrative computing were all located in the Rich  Computing building.  The school of ICS was only about four years old. Students were assigned computer IDs for use with specific classes.  The preferred method for the  introductory and undergraduate classes was to use punched cards.  While I was a student and a TA,  most classes required the students to turn in card decks for their computing assignments.  The TA would  run the card decks, get the printed output and grade those.   To use the computer systems, students had to physically visit the Rich building, type their programs onto  cards using the punch card machines (which often didn’t print the text on them), take the deck of cards  to a window and hand the deck to an attendant – the operator.  The attendant would then batch that  deck with decks from other students and run the batch of cards.  The output would be printed and delivered to bins in the hallway.  The student would retrieve their deck  and printout, then repeat the process to make changes or corrections.   When you enter the Rich building,     the attendant window was straight ahead.  and immediately turn right and up the steps, this was the student area where the card punch  machines and the User Services area were located (your mother and I were both User Assistants  and worked in this area helping other students with their programming assignments).  and turn left, the bins were in the hallway.    Transition to CRT terminals happened about a year later, so that by the time your mother started in Fall  1977 most ICS classes were taught using terminals.  You still needed to be physically in the Rich building  at a terminal.  Needless to say, classes didn’t have terminals.  Program code was written on chalk boards  or projected using an overhead projector.  The student took hand-written notes and then went to the  Rich building outside of class to do the assignments.   The computers were a CDC Cyber 70-74 for academic computing and a CDC Cyber 6400 for  administrative computing.  They were both located in the fishbowl room in Rich.  Both were water  cooled.  They used 6-bit words and an octal (not hexadecimal or ASCII) character set.  The Cyber 70-74  was in the class of the fastest and most advanced computers in the world at the time.  It had 256K of  core memory (real core:  magnetic ferrite tori).  The CPU stood about six feet high and was a plus-sign  shape.  The shape was chosen to minimize the distance of the wires between components, since it was  the length of the wires that limited the speed and performance of the system.  The length of the wires  between components was critical and they were carefully measured so that coordinated content got to components simultaneously.  The system designer, Seymour Cray {of Cray Supercomputing}, complained that the speed of light  was the critical factor limiting the speed of his computer systems.   The CPU was so fast relative to the peripheral systems (disks, printers, etc.), that the Cyber was designed  with supporting peripheral processors (PPUs) that had their own operating system to feed content to  the CPU, so that precious CPU cycles were neither spent nor lost managing or waiting on external  devices.  (This design is not significantly different from today’s disk drive-based processors and cache to  improve disk performance.)   Disk drives were about the size of a home washing machine.  They had removable spindles, multiple  platters to a spindle, so that content could be removed and secured.  Platters were a bit larger than a  large pizza.  A disk drive had about 100Mb to 200Mb capacity, depending on model.  Tech had less than  a dozen, between both systems.    When the administration finished with the 6400 at night, their disk spindles were removed and locked  up.  There were extra spindles that could be loaded into the drives at that point so that various  development and testing could be done by the computer center staff, since this computer was  completely idle and isolated.  Late at night, the student employees could also play on this machine.  One  of the amusements was to write programs on the PPU controlling the disk drives to move the arm in and  out, to get the drive shaking and walking across the floor, much like a home washing machine that is out  of balance.    As previously mentioned, user IDs were assigned for a given class.  Students didn’t have permanent user  IDs.  There was no email.  While I was a student, one of my fellow students, Dwight, wrote one of the  earliest Forum programs (it was called Forum), which was a sort-of collective Facebook (though text  only).   Another student, Jim, wrote one of the earliest multi-player shoot-em-up games, with users navigating  space ships to control interstellar territory.   There was no such thing as word processing.  Another student, Roy, wrote a text formatting program,  which worked similarly to modern HTML, to take straight text and format the printout with bold, italic,  centering, etc. so that reports and homework could be done on the computer rather than a typewriter.  {I am straight up unable to find a picture of the CDC 70-74.  they don't seem to exist anywhere}"
gatech,3dgn17,Josh_Morton,21,Thu Jul 16 03:44:27 2015 UTC,"Mom:  When I arrived at Tech in 1977, the terminal cluster was up the steps in the Rich building.  This area consisted of carrels with teletypes or CRT terminals.  CRTs were few; it was mostly  teletypes which were like automatic typewriters.  They printed on a roll of paper at 110 baud.   The CRTs were 300 or 1200 baud. Still slow enough to watch the screen repaint line by line  (though at 1200 you had to watch fast).  The key punch machines were down stairs in a hallway  near the bins. There were two kinds.  This was important because you had to put a special card  at the start of your deck to tell the system which keypunch was used.  There were stacks of pre- punched green, pink, and blue cards.  No card in front meant one type of keypunch one color  meant the other kind.  The other two colors were end-of-file to separate your program from  your data and end-of-job.   Dad mentioned handing in your deck and getting printouts from the machine room but a year  later there was a small reader in the keypunch hallway and printer for quick printouts.   You  couldn’t run big decks but a student program was short enough and you could send your  compiles to the quick printer if someone hadn’t jammed it.   We were on a quarter system in those days, 3 quarters per year, plus summer.  1st quarter was a  general overview of computing – no computer use.  2nd quarter was how to use the computer  via terminal, commands, using the editor, creating and saving files and so on.  3rd quarter was  the first programming class – Pascal.  We were told that we could use the terminals to do our  work but we had to turn in a card deck.  The deck could be small, containing commands to get  the program file, and run it.  However we weren’t trained in using the keypunches and only a  few printed the text at the top.  So you typed the cards and handed them in hoping they would  work.  I didn’t test mine because I thought they system would run the program and magically  grade it if I pre-ran the deck.  I don’t know WHAT I was thinking. Many of the card decks didn’t  work.  Our TA (your dad) often figured out what was supposed to be on the cards and made  them run anyway. {imagine if you got a 0 for noncompiling solutions back then}  There were times when there were lines for the terminals and after a few years when more  people were using the terminals the lines could get quite long.  The Rich building closed at 2am  each night and reopened at sometime between 6 and 8, I don’t remember.  At some point  during my student time the building began to be open 24 hours.  The progression from  teletypes to CRTs meant work went faster and the more terminals could fit. Most offices outside the Rich building used dial-up service to connect to the computers.  Over  the next few years, the campus was wired and multiplexers were added to various buildings –  the admin and school buildings, not the dorms.  This allowed campus-wide access at about  1200 baud, 3 times faster than dial up and later 9600 baud.   At this time even students could  us dial up if they had remote access via terminal and acoustic coupler.  The average student did  not have a terminal but there were the hard-core folks who lived for computing who invested in  such things.   Late sophomore year I got a job in the machine room as a “paper tearer”.   The big greenbar  impact printer was very fast.  Every 15-20 minutes it was my job to pause the printer, tear off  the recently printed output and re-start the printer.  Then I would flip through the output to  find the start of each printout, tear them apart and sort them into the bins so people could pick  up their output.  I did not hold the job very long because I was hired as a user-assistant to work  in the office behind the cluster.   The user assistance job came with the benefit of keys that got you into the Rich building, the  User Assistant {think of this like a mix between resnet, CS TAs, and OIT} offices, the machine room, and some of the upstairs offices.  This was a  wonderful thing because it meant access to terminals that few people competed for and we  could stay in the building after it closed and had the whole cluster available – very handy for  finishing up those programs – or playing.  It also meant that we could use the text formatting  program to write papers and print them out on 8 ½ x 11 pin fed white paper.  The other  alternatives were hand written or typewriter.   After graduation I began working full time for Tech and a couple of years later took over  managing the User Assistants.  Terminal access was faster, but you still used dial up from off  campus.  A second terminal cluster was opened up in the Boggs building with special fancy CDC  terminals that had some extra capabilities.   PCs had come out and we were experimenting with  IBM PCs and Apples.   PC’s replaced some then all of the terminals in the main cluster.   Unix systems had been added to the machine room and student access was available.  Also an  IBM mainframe was added for both the administration and some student use.  For hardcore  engineers this seemed like a step backward but the IBM had its fans among management,  business folks and researchers doing data analysis.  I think a large group of us spent about a  week unshrinkwrapping the manuals putting the pages in binders and collating the pages from  several updates.   Oh yeah, manuals were paper in those days.     In 1984 the PC AT came out.  It introduced the new 3 ½ inch floppy disks (that weren’t very  floppy) along with a 20 mb hard drive.  Alan organized a group purchase for the tech staff.  We  got a group discount and many of us ordered our first home PC.  I got an AT with 512kb  memory and a 20 mb hard drive, an EGA color monitor, a 132 character wide pin feed dot  matrix printer and a bunch of software for the low, low price of $6000 dollars.    We took out a  bank loan to pay for it over a couple of years. The clock speed on the AT was faster than the  original PC or XT so Stan wrote a slowdown program for it so he could still play games on it.   Also in 1984 the first Apple Macintosh was released.   We got an early model to play with and  test.  I had a great time playing missile command on it.  In the next year an additional cluster  was added at the student center containing Macs.  Originally it was used mostly for writing  papers and resumes because the output was so pretty.  Of course Mac cluster required a small  laser printer to print the pretty fonts.   Sometime in the ‘80s as email became more prevalent a project was instituted to provide all  students, faculty and staff with a permanent user ID for consistent communication.  Before that  IDs were related to the class you were taking or where you worked.   {yes, this was the beginning of the jmorton## style of name, my mom got to chose hers}  Another big event was the transition from green bar paper to a high speed laser printer.  This  printer went through several cases of paper each day.  We programmed it so the default output  was an imitation of the 14x11 green bar page shrunk down so that two of them fit on one sheet  of 8 ½ by 11 paper.  It was printed double-sided fitting 4 big pages on one regular size page.   The print was tiny but 90% of what got printed in those days was reviewed, used to fix  problems and thrown out.  It didn’t take long for one of my favorite users, a professor to  complain.  The print was too small, his old eyes couldn’t read that small.  Something I can  sympathize with these days.  We quickly revised the process so people could print bigger if they  wanted.      Also during this time terminals were replaced with Macs, PCs, Sun workstations, Next machines  and other powerful systems.  There were clusters in the Rich building, Boggs, Student Center,  and Library.  Various academic departments had their own clusters for their own students.   Things had become decentralized.  OCS (Office of Computing Services) became OIT.   Working  from home became possible.  Not frequently but sometimes.  my comments in braces"

gatech,3dgn17,techbuzz,2,Thu Jul 16 04:32:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome stories! I have a relative who was at Tech in the early-mid 80s. He didn't use the computers a whole lot as an electrical engineer, but he did take a required intro FORTRAN class, I guess the equivalent to CS 1371 back in the day. He said there was a terminal with an acoustic coupler modem in his dorm (Freeman) that he used to submit his assignments into a batch pool on the Cyber mainframe. Then he would pick up the result printout from the Rich building.  Apparently by that time, someone at Tech had written a text editor that was used on the Cyber. He has a copy of the instruction manual for it (in purple Ditto machine ink, of course) that I need to go find and post. I'd love to know more about it."
gatech,3dgn17,bjgbob,2,Thu Jul 16 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"These are great stories that bring back lots of memories.  One of my favorite pieces of hardware was the tape robot on the side of data center, across from the TA's office. It used tape cartridges with six-inch-wide tape that was fully unspooled as it was read or written.  It was fun to watch through the window.  I also recall that the Cyber's were so big, people went into them to repair them.  They were very fast for the time and used discrete transistors.  There were times when an engineer, armed with a soldering iron, would go into the machine to replace a component.  This year is the 50th anniversary of School of Information Science and the 25th of the College of Computing.  Tech has some nice online resources commemorating the event here.  As it happens, I am heading to Tech in about an hour for a tour of the College, so these posts couldn't have come a better time.  My years at Tech were an amazing, wonderful, irritating, frustrating, incredible time.  I started my career and met my wife there.  I can't imagine what my life would be had I not gone to Tech.  And now my son is there, as an ME.  It is a really special thing to sing ""and if I had a son, sir, I'd tell you what he'd do: he would yell 'To hell with Georgia!' like his Daddy used to do"" and really mean it."

As a freshman at Tech in 79-80, I didn't have any ICS courses, so had no experience with the computers of the day.   I also ended up transferring out to finish my undergrad at a different university, but came back to Atlanta in 1988 for graduate school. By that time we had clusters all over the place of course. Still had a CDC Cyber, although I don't remember the model. We did have email addresses that were based on our school IDs, but there was really no one to send email to outside of school.  I had a Mac SE and a modem, so I could dial up the school and use the mainframe from home. I recall there was some terminal emulator you had to use on the Mac. There were also PC clusters in the Aerospace building that were populated with the new Mac IIs that had color screens!"

Hanson was boys, Hopkins was girls, but the doors were locked all the time, and our keys did not open Hopkins.

Hanson was also designated as some kind of stay-over dorm for people that could not go home over Christmas break. So before the break everyone on the floor had to pack up their room so it could be used by someone else. I think we were able to lock up some of the storage in our rooms, and one room on the floor was turned into a storage room for everyone and locked up. It was a huge PITA and just crazy now that I think back on it."
gatech,3dgn17,ConvertsToMetric,3,Thu Jul 16 10:44:43 2015 UTC,"Other random memories:  Our dorm (Hanson) was populated with a mix of all classes, freshmen through seniors. So we had all sorts of bad influences ;-) right from day one. Freshmen were required to be on a meal plan for at least the first quarter, but after that you could do what you wanted. We typically ate in Brittain, which as I recall was really terrible. After a quarter of that, some of the upperclassmen on our floor convinced us to sell our meal plans back in the winter quarter. We used the money for the ""Junior's Meal Plan"" instead, which was basically a ticket book: $22 worth of meal tickets for $20.  At the time, Junior's was a tiny place on North Ave -- it had a lunch counter with stools, and then a counter along the wall with stools. No room for tables.  [Edit: actually, the wall counter was for standing, no stools there] We would go at least 3 or 4 times a week for dinner (""dress two side""), and the other nights we would go to MJ Pippins across from the AE building. They had the best deep dish pizza -- I still miss it.  When I returned in '88, Junior's had expanded into the old Engineer's Bookstore space. The food was the same and so was Tommy of course. I'm sad that when we take my son down in August we won't be able to go to Junior's Grill..."

You just very slowly write your proposal and thesis over the course of the semester and it's broken up so it's not bad.

Basically the daytime workers are hired though the student center. They're paid the same rate as the other auxiliary student center workers which is, I think, $9.25 an hour. They are not hiring for the fall semester at the moment, but look for a student center general hiring session in the fall if you want to get a job there.  It may be somewhat difficult to get the specific job at Under the Couch since it's honestly little to no real work.

gatech,3dfknv,underthecouchadv,2,Wed Jul 15 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"It's $7.75/hour, and I think it increases marginally the longer you're employed. The job is not hard- mostly playing music, answering any questions anyone has / helping people who walk in with something, making sure nothing gets stolen / nothing nefarious is going on in the space and letting people with scheduled practice into the practice rooms. There are some additional responsibilities like active and passive programming hours, and if you're opening or closing the space you have to lock/unlock and turn on/off the audio + projector equipment. Most of the time it's just playing music and doing your homework / whatever you want.  As u/zesoft mentioned, hiring for the position doesn't happen very often, but do look out for the email about SC hiring sessions every semester. It helps to be a member of the Musician's Network (the club he mentioned), as members tend to already be pretty familiar with the space and its events.

Ergonomics and aesthetic considerations are so important for designing something as intimate and necessary as prosthetics. Knowing how to draw your ideas and communicate with designers will also be important in engineering in general.   I was ID and my boyfriend was BME.  We've worked together so much and he's sought valuable input from me on his BME projects and vice versa.  As I get more and more interested in medical device design, I feel so lucky to have a BME major on call.   It's such a great combo."

Unfortunately, if you really want to get into prosthetics, it might be tougher to find a well established large company that specializes in it. You still have 3 years of school left though, so you have plenty of time to figure this all out. My only real advice would be to talk to the advisors and professors on campus about this. They're going to be your best resource. Best of luck with everything!"

gatech,3d99d1,meganleigh1114,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:20 2015 UTC,Yea most of your huge medical device companies aren't into prosthetics for some reason. Maybe cause it's a relatively small market? Idk.

gatech,3d99d1,hacelepues,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:02:46 2015 UTC,If you're interested in designing external prosthetics then definitely go for the ID minor. If you're interested in other aspects like interfacing/wiring/etc chase CS a little harder or look at EE.  If it's chemical prosthetics then you might want to look at ChemE.   I just asked my bf and he said Medtronics or Phallauer are companies but he's not sure. He's going the research route at the moment.
gatech,3d99d1,hacelepues,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I haven't given up on CS yet. I'm going to give it a semester and hope that it works out, but if not then I will have to switch because I know it can delay graduation. I would really like a minor in EE or ECE, but neither has a minor option, so basically I'm stuck to either CS, ID, MSE, or a handful of liberal arts minors which I'm not very interested in. Yea Medtronics has an orthopaedics department that I am aware of but most companies like Medtronics deal with things like joint replacement, not necessarily external prostheses. I may be wrong though."
gatech,3d99d1,meganleigh1114,4,Tue Jul 14 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"The main thing I would be wary about is if you have to take studio classes for the minor DON'T DO IT. That plus a regular BME semester would be a killer IMO. Also your minor might be better spent on a more technical aspect of the field such as EE, CS, or chemistry. You SHOULD be taught some basics of ergonomics and user focused design but idk if that is still a focus. I've never been on a team where they want the engineer to also make it look nice. If they really care enough they'll hire somebody with a deep background in ID. If you're interested in the startup space it may be a great skill to add(they won't want pay an extra person to design things) but if you want to be with a big company then it might not be the best use of your time."
gatech,3d99d1,tharmon57921,5,Tue Jul 14 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a BME and just started the ID minor. The ID advisor gives registration permits for the minor classes, and no studio classes are involved. I think the ID minor will be extremely valuable to have if you want to go into medical devices."
gatech,3d99d1,tharmon57921,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:23:58 2015 UTC,Yea not having to do studio makes that a much more attractive option.

gatech,3d99d1,tharmon57921,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"Actually for the ID minor I found that you have to take ID 4833 which is described as a ""studio experience"" and named ST: Collaborative. Is this an actual studio class? Is this class in particular too much work (on top of a BME load)?"
gatech,3d99d1,tharmon57921,2,Wed Jul 15 00:07:44 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that that's not a true studio for two reasons: 1) the people I know who have done the minor say there's no studio 2) it's worth the same number of credit hours as the other classes. Studio ranges from 4-5 credit hours so there's no way it can be as intensive with only 3 credits
gatech,3d99d1,tharmon57921,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:44 2015 UTC,Ohh okay that makes sense. Yea I was slightly confused because online they make it seem like a pseudo-studio class. Well that saves a whole lot of time them. Thanks for clarifying!
gatech,3d99d1,apul_madeekaud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:05:09 2015 UTC,The advisor told me it is like a mini capstone type of class for the minor.
gatech,3d99d1,apul_madeekaud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:41:35 2015 UTC,Ah okay. Do you know if that would be too much to do with senior design?
gatech,3d99d1,apul_madeekaud,3,Wed Jul 15 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"Yea that makes sense. I really wanted to go into a more technical minor such as CS but I've heard very bad things about CS minors and how it can delay graduation with very hard to get into classes. Other than that, there are no EE or ECE minors offered which I would have liked to do. Currently, my plan is to try out CS and hope that everything goes well, and if not then try ID or MSE (for a more technical minor). But at this point, I am very confused as to what to do."
gatech,3d964n,FaceWaitForItPalm,11,Tue Jul 14 14:01:15 2015 UTC,So long as it's been on the syllabus before drop day they can do whatever they want.
gatech,3d964n,tharmon57921,3,Tue Jul 14 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.  Let's refer to the official rules, sections 12c and 12d:   No assessment other than final examinations or their replacement may be due during the final examination period.   What about Dead Week?   For all courses, graded homework or assignments, lab reports, course projects, demonstrations, studio reviews, and presentations may be due during [the last two days a course officially meets], provided that they are listed on the syllabus at the start of the semester.  All quizzes and tests should be graded and reported to students on or before the last final instructional day.   So no, a professor is not allowed to have an assignment due during finals week.  Can students agree to let this slide? Well, there's a policy that a class can move its final exam to another time during finals week with approval and a unanimous secret ballot of the class. But I don't see a similar policy about assignments.  Should OP do anything about it? That depends. Some professors do get a bit vindictive. And having one less week to work on an assignment is usually not beneficial. But if OP has a lot of finals, or particularly hard finals, he/she may appreciate having the extra time to study without also needing to complete an assignment.  Ultimately, it's up to OP (and other students in the class) to decide whether to raise a complaint or not. But the correct answer to ""was the professor allowed to do this in the first place"" is ""no""."
gatech,3d964n,BigPeteB,3,Wed Jul 15 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"It says in the section you quoted that they can't be due during the final exam period, not finals week. I get your point but it's that kind of wording that lets professors do this. I appreciate you taking the time to look at the actual rules but my explanation is what was trotted out time and time again whenever somebody in a class I took challenged a due date. It never ends well for the students. If it's in the syllabus chances are somebody above that professor approved it and it won't be changed."
gatech,3d964n,tharmon57921,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"It says in the section you quoted that they can't be due during the final exam period, not finals week. I get your point but it's that kind of wording that lets professors do this.   Wow, interesting technicality. I'm sure the intention behind the phrase ""final examination period"" was the week of finals, but you're right, it is ambiguous enough that someone could argue differently based on the literal wording.  I wonder what would be involved in changing that wording to something less ambiguous, and who you'd have to talk to? I guess someone in the registrar's office, maybe.   If it's in the syllabus chances are somebody above that professor approved it   I don't think that's likely, actually. Well, it probably depends on the department. But in general, administration doesn't get involved with a professor's running of the class unless they have to. I'm not aware of professors needing to submit their syllabi for approval.   and it won't be changed.   Definitely not true, at least not 100% of the time. I have heard from multiple people who took a complaint about dead week or finals week to the Dean of Students and got it changed.  Again, it's up to OP to decide whether it's better to ask for the assignment to be due early to have time off for studying, or just deal with it in order to have more time for the assignment. But if OP does decide they'd prefer to make a complaint, they should try actually complaining. It does no one any good to mope about saying ""Woe is me, someone is breaking the rules, but I don't think they'll do anything about it so I won't bother complaining."""
gatech,3d964n,BigPeteB,2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with your last point about trying being better than whining. I was mostly just relaying my experiences to OP. Also you're probably right about syllabi approval varying by department. The only process I know is from BME where, when I TA'd, the prof had to submit a syllabus to our department for approval which is why we scrambled to fill guest lecture spots at the last minute before the semester began. But nonetheless I appreciate your well thought out replies."
gatech,3d964n,tharmon57921,6,Wed Jul 15 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"lol i graduated 7 years ago and we were fighting this battle then. Good luck, but I'm sure things will continue to be due and assigned during dead weak and/or finals week."
gatech,3d964n,AllThatJellyNoToast,4,Tue Jul 14 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Look, majority of the times, this is in your best interests. Would you rather the professor to move the deadline to a week earlier, or give you an extra week, but make it due during finals? I think you would choose the latter option.  I remember the case where students in one of my classes were pretty much asking to give an extension to an assignment so it would be due during finals week"
gatech,3d964n,Filoleg94,14,Tue Jul 14 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, well.  Here's how it looks to the professor:  Students: Please give us an extension  Prof: That will put us into dead week  Students: Pllllleeeease  Prof: Fine.  <two days later>  Provost's Office: Two students (it's always two students) have complained that you're assigning projects due dead week. You are a terrible person.  Prof: ARGH."
gatech,3d964n,HFh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"Some people just want to do everything possible to justify ""unfairness"" of their grade or to get a better one (besides growing up and admitting to the lack of effort or trying better), including throwing the prof under the bus of Provost's Office.  I remember a story told at my first TA meeting about how there was a case in the department when a student was pleading to the Dean that she can't take finals, that she got a major case of depression, and how her life is ruined. All of it simply because she herself approached the TA outside of class, asked him questions about the test she got back (with a disastrous score) and to comment on her score, and he said something along the lines of ""well, it is not good, so just try to do better on the next one."" It then trickled down all the way from Dean to the actual professor."
gatech,3d964n,Filoleg94,5,Tue Jul 14 18:11:57 2015 UTC,I would rather not have assignments due during dead week or finals week. I agree that students will ask for that a lot of the time but I think it's silly. The last thing I want to worry about while studying for finals is another freaking assignment. And in my case this due date wasn't set by asking for an extension. I'm going into my fourth year at Tech and never once have I had a class where an assignment was due during finals week when there was also a final in the class. I know there are rules about dead week but I am shocked that there is no rules regarding finals week.

gatech,3d8n7k,StolenNachoRanger,20,Tue Jul 14 10:45:36 2015 UTC,I'm an AE and I've heard that this class is fairly important for later classes.   Who in the world told you that? MSE 2001 is completely useless. It's the least relevant and least useful class I ever took at tech (I was AE as well). I've told several professors they really need to take that crap out of our curriculum and replace it with a good math/numerical methods/programming class.  If someone told you MSE 2001 was important for AE they honestly must have been trolling you. You sure they didn't mean COE 2001 (Statics)? That's a fairly important foundation class. MSE 2001 is just a waste of time.
gatech,3d8n7k,McMalloc,9,Tue Jul 14 14:01:37 2015 UTC,MSE student here. Gonna second what this guy said. It's pretty useless for anyone who's not MSE or does not intend on specializing in materials selection for other engineering fields. It's useful to know but I don't really see AE's using it in later classes.
gatech,3d8n7k,bjchu92,3,Tue Jul 14 14:29:40 2015 UTC,"The only thing relevant to AE they teach in that class is mechanical properties of materials, which is like 2 classes of material and 4 test questions. They show you the classic curve and ask what Young's modulus is, and that's about it. But we learn a hundred times more depth on that subject in COE 3001 and the MSE class only barely touches up on it anyway.  Everything else from MSE 2001 is 100% irrelevant to AE. For an MSE major I would imagine MSE 2001 is a nice little intro class that exposes you to some of the material you will be actually learning later on, maybe to spark your interest in certain sub fields of Materials Science; but I have no idea why they require it for AEs."
gatech,3d8n7k,McMalloc,2,Tue Jul 14 14:43:21 2015 UTC,They require it because it's one of those nice classes that give you a touch of a different engineering field without go too deep into the material.
gatech,3d8n7k,bjchu92,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:55 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I am a 4th year AE.  I learned nothing from my MSE 2001 class here at Tech. Got a B though. Moved and and it hasn't slowed me down at all.  At my coop it may have been a little useful, but they require the coops to take a crash course in materials anyways.  tl;dr  MSE 2001 doesn't matter for AEs. You'll be fine"

You don't receive a grade, so it won't affect your GPA, but it also takes some willpower to keep up with the class when there's no penalty for falling behind. I don't think auditing is typically allowed for required classes, since they'd rather give the seat to a student who needs the credit, but it can't hurt to ask."

gatech,3d8n7k,decentishUsername,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:56 2015 UTC,"ME I assume? Truth is you'll need like 3 things you Learned in that class later on. Furthermore, every engineer I know (I graduate in two weeks, have done a co-op, etc.) has told me you MIGHT use a little bit of one class one day once you start working. You absolutely won't be expected to know everything you were taught (that's why we have books), especially in a 2000-level course. I hope this helps but the moral of the Story is to press on. You made a good grade. Accept it because that will probably be more rare at this school than you currently think. I felt the exact same way as you about diff EQ and it turns out I've only ever needed the bare fundamentals for later courses, damn near like every pre-req ever with the exception of math."

Personally, I prefer using the school computers to my laptop because I like having 2 screens.  In CS 1371 (Matlab), which you will have to take, you will need to take your test on a laptop.  The test does not allow you to use Matlab, so don't worry about the computer needing that.    It must have an internet connection.  And you need to be able to type on it.

If the stone is your thing, go for it. It just looks more like a high school ring to me.   Best tip I can give you, though: get your 4 letter major not the two letter degree. The salesman tried to sell me on just getting ""BS"" for bachelor's of science. He said the 4 letters look too cramped. So I did. You can have one free ""re make"" if your graduation year or major changes. I didn't change majors but lady year when I sent it in to be resized, I got them to remake it with ""BSIE"".

gatech,3d67zt,Slawofcole,5,Tue Jul 14 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"Best tips i can give you are these:  You dont have to buy top notch stuff asap.  Part of the fun in building a desktop is that you can always upgrade it when you get some spending money.    Mother boards: There are basically two types, ones that use AMD chips and ones that use Intel chips.  The former is a lot cheaper, but you have to do your research.  The latter is easier to buy since at the moment Intel has a straightforward naming scheme.  i3, i5, i7.  (we dont talk about celeron crap).  One other thing, if you go with intel, you might even dual boot into mac os and have yourself a hackintosh in the future.    ram is ram.  8 gigs is plenty for anyone.    Graphics cards:  Buy the best one you can with your budget.  only have 100 for a card, buy a 100 card and upgrade it next year.  Hard Drives:  SSD, 50 bucks gets you a 120 gig ssd these days.  150 gets you 500 gigs.  Ditch the mechanicals.  Power supply:  requires a bit of research, but 600watts should be a good starting point.    Cases:  no need to have a fancy case that has tons of gimicks, i always recomend this one.    Corsair Carbide Series SPEC-01 Mid Tower Gaming Case CC-9011050-WW  its about 55 bucks.  Monitor:  22 inch 1080p.  about 150 for a decent one.    speakers: walmart.  20 bucks, good enough.    Last but not least, just buy everything on amazon.  that way if something breaks you dont have to mess around trying to figure out who to send it back to.  And because you have amazon prime you will get your stuff hella fast.    Best of luck."

It was a lot of manufacturing and process generation. They wanted me to help the company, small family owned, and come up with procedures and methods to increase efficiencies . iE work. But what ended up happening is that hose skills helped me get a coop elsewhere with more AE work. Don't ever have an empty summer. Study abroad if you need too.

If I don't, I got more experience talking to recruiters and learning what to (and not to) do to get an interview."" It is possible for freshmen to get internships.

I had totally different experiences at my major fair than my friends did at all majors.   Career services has some great workshops that they do in the lead up to the career fairs as well. The ones I went to covered interviewing, resumes, and cover letters, and were hosted by this man, who was fantastic. Please go to these if you can.

gatech,3d3fbu,decentishUsername,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"Start as soon as possible just for the experience of it. The first time I went to the career fair I wasn't actually looking for a job. I went around talking to companies (and other more prepared students) about various aspects of getting an internship and working an internship. Most importantly I heard from specific companies what they want to see on your resume (mainly experience, which can be had through student organizations). I also just got used to how to go around the career fair and got a bunch of free stuff.   So I would recommend making a serious resume, suiting up and talking to employers about how you seem as a prospective applicant, what you can do to improve your resume and what companies are looking for in interns. Most people now just tell you to apply online anyways so really going to the career fair will give you some inside information on applying."

The pen is a separate input from a normal touch screen, too, so you can move around the page pretty easily (just don't get a magnetic case).   I also tried using it for other classes, but I ended up going pen and paper for some of them.  It's great, especially if you have a lot of handouts.

Second semester you may have more of a chance. But I would shop around not so much by topic for English, but rather by professor.

gatech,3cxxbo,k1n6,2,Sat Jul 11 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"To kind of explain the process, when I took this class I knew what was going on maybe 30% of the time.  From day one, you're given every assignment you'll have for the whole class and you're encouraged to start early.  Now, this isn't the usual teacher telling you not to wait until the last minute to start an assignment because some of these machine learning algorithms can take hours to run.  That's not so bad except at the end of the running you may find that the information generated is worthless and you need to find a new data set.  The exams are specifically designed for you not to finish and the assignments are defined in such a way that puts the burden of finding interesting meaning in generated data on you.  This class is not a walk in the park and in order to get that A or B, you will need to struggle.  All that being said, going into the final exam, if you calculated my raw grade I was failing.  I had put my best effort and it just wasn't good enough, but the professor reassured everyone that your raw grade is almost meaningless and that a lot of individuals are probably in the same boat.  Took the final, was done with the class, got a grade back and it was a B.  His metrics for curving are very complex and you will learn a lot of new statistics terms when he tells you about it."

The projects are relatively straightforward, though grading has a very high variance due to the TAs.  Exams are strange, but fair.  Even then, as /u/Josh_Morton  said, the curve is very forgiving.  I know ~60% translated to an A for most people.  Honestly, you'll likely put a lot of work into the course 6 days during the semester: 4 projects, 2 exams.  As for the content, it's incredibly interesting. And the professor, /u/hfh, has an electrifying personality -which could be directly related to his mentioning of his Tesla every 2 lectures..."
gatech,3cxxbo,arcticlobo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"As has been said, you'll probably get an A or a B, but you won't know that until the semester is over. I found the class pretty stressful, as the assignments require a good bit of work, and the tests are somewhat hard to prepare for.  There are only four assignments over the semester, but each is a 10-12 page paper on some kind of machine learning. The algorithms take awhile to run, so the projects can be very time consuming.   The tests are stressful because there are only two of them, and IIRC, you aren't really given any sort of guide other than ""study everything"". That being said, they're not impossible, and he curves pretty generously.  After all that though, I definitely recommend the class. You learn a tremendous amount about different kinds of machine learning, and I found it all very interesting."
gatech,3cxxbo,swordfire,2,Sun Jul 12 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"As an IE, you may even be at an advantage since so much of the course revolves around statistics. As long as you've taken 2316, you'll be fine in terms of programming, since all but one of the projects can be completed without do any programming whatsoever. However, the content itself is pretty difficult to grasp because he explains things at a very theoretical level and just expects people to understand.  But the amount that you actually understand doesn't really matter that much since he gave out a ridiculous number of A's, and essentially everyone else got a B.

gatech,3cxcrc,imnotpopular,5,Sat Jul 11 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"I went in 2010 (yes, I'm that old) and they were still doing Media/People Thread courses (HCI, Computational Photography) and they even had the ethics course. If I remember correctly, there were 4 CS classes, 2 ARCH classes, and some Spanish. They usually offer Media/People classes because they're more fun to do abroad (unlike CS 1050!), and they usually integrate Media/People topics in the culture of Barcelona.   When do you plan on going? If it's next summer (2016) I would hold off on taking those courses and enjoy them there. Remember, Tech wants you to go abroad, and will find a way to get course credits for you if necessary. If you can, e-mail the coordinator for the program. They usually figure out what classes they'll teach a year in advance. Best of luck, and excellent choice on study abroad!"
gatech,3cxcrc,hoteltech,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"Tanks for the response! I'm planning on going after my 4th year, but the classes would be taken from my 3rd year. So it sounds like I should be able to find out before I register for that year then! Any gripes with the program as a whole? Or is it definitely  something you'd reccomend?"
gatech,3cxcrc,hoteltech,4,Sat Jul 11 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"If the course structure is the same or similar, you should be able to take more coding intensive classes while you're in Atlanta and take the fun stuff in Barcelona. I'm pretty sure most of the courses aren't Pre-Reqs either; it's on a year by year basis though. And don't take any open/free electives! The architecture classes are awesome (if they're still being offered).  The program was brilliantly done. They gave us two 1 week breaks to explore Europe, and expected us to stay in Barcelona on the weekends and deeply/meaningfully explore the city. I spent my second one week break walking everywhere and seeing other parts of Catalunya. My recommendation is that you spend as much time taking the regional train around Catalunya and see more of Spain if possible. My major gripes were the things I didn't get to do. In terms of the program, there's really not much more they could have done; it was a fair amount of work, enough to be a real class but not enough to keep you from exploring.   Specific recommendations:   Montserrat: 1 hour train to the most amazing church complex cut into the top of a mountain. Olot. Never got to go, has an amazing history. In fact, check out the whole province of Girona. Valencia. Another one I missed out on. I've studied it a lot since Barcelona. It operates an interesting counterpart to BCN. Perpignan. A few hours away (like Girona), worth a weekend trip. It's actually in France, but it's amazing to see Southern France and Catalunya meet. Inside the city, you have to chill at Montjuic. Amazing area, great museums, and I got to see Spain win the World Cup Final in the Placa Espana with 80k other people!  Go hike up Tibidabo. Take the cable car down. Bring plenty of juice for yourself and your camera; the church up there is amazing. Give yourself plenty of time to walk and roam. Give yourself a few hours everyday to walk aimlessly and see what you find. One of my favorite things to do was find the public courtyards (most blocks in BCN have courtyards, a lot of them aren't accessible from the street). Sit down, eat a croissant, read. The best part about Barcelona (and the worst part about leaving) is how easy it is to 'live' there. Things are affordable, there's lots to do, but it's not a pressure cooker (like NYC).  You're going to have a great time! One last concern: don't get pickpocketed! Always put your wallet in your front pocket, and if a friendly stranger comes up to talk to you, make sure you have all your stuff accounted for; friendly strangers in BCN usually have an accomplice. Fortunately, pickpocketing is the only crime you have to worry about."

They had a slightly different experience, cause they were 20 and just excited that they could drink in bars. If it fits your schedule going after your third year might not be a bad idea just to be a more similar age to most people.   I went to four countries during the first one-week break. That was too much. The second one, I flew to Marrakech, did an overnight tourist excursion to the Sahara, took the overnight train to Tangier, took the ferry across to Gibraltar, then rented a car and drove back to Barcelona, stopping in Granada, Alicante, and Valencia. That was an awesome experience, and I definitely recommend Morocco, but I've heard it can be rough for women traveling alone. (Their culture expects women to be escorted by men. Go figure.)"

Looking at your curriculum (http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/colleges/coe/mse/ugrad/bsmse/bsmse-sfm.php) it seems you have 6 hours of humanities, 6 hours of SS, and 4 hours of free electives, which should be enough (if you haven't already taken a bunch of electives!). You can also take CS Ethics instead of engineering ethics, and they usually offer that in BCN. Some time in the Fall they'll probably decide which classes they're offering, but it wouldn't hurt to email the coordinators some time soon. Also, I forgot to mention in the other post, but you can take Spanish there, and that should count for a Humanities credit (though things might have changed since I graduated!)."

As for courses, most years they offer this is this years offered courses.  Last year, instead of infosec they offered graphics and psych 3040, so there were classes for media, people, intelligence, and 2 for all threads last year, and this year there are courses for People, media, infonetworks, and 2 for errbody.  If you're people and media, save comp photo at least, and 2050 and 4001, and you've got a schedule that will likely be availible, though its obvs risky doing that.  As for postponing things, taking 4001 in BCN is not a bad idea, I know people who do that.  I'd be scared to postpone multiple courses though, even though 4475 will almost always be there."

The topic that semester was multimodal communication, so in addition to reading a few books, we also got to watch a few movies in class and even do some exercises with video games. I think I only had to write two papers for the class, and the rest of the assignments were different kinds of group projects. All of them were different; I ended up doing a faux radio broadcast, a simple website, and I don't remember what else. There was a lot of creative freedom involved. I always thought his assessments were fair, and he was always friendly and encouraged discussion in and out of class.  Since then, though, I heard he started teaching a completely video game-themed class alongside another professor which was more difficult than the class I took.

For CS1332, just implement the data structures or algorithms in the lectures. That's all the homeworks are anyways. Linked lists, array lists, heaps, hashsets, binary search trees, graph search, string searching, etc. Good news is they are all really common, so there are standard APIs available online that you can use as a guideline for what you need to implement.  CS1331 is a bit more difficult. If you just want to practice coding, especially object oriented, pick a project. Try implementing a card game. It won't be just like the homework, and it won't necessarily cover concepts like polymorphism or whatever unless you set your own stricter requirements for it. But it's still good coding practice and can help you figure out if you find CS fun. Also if you can find an OO textbook a lot of times they include exercises."

However if I did the 1211 route I would also need 1212 to get the core curriculum credit. I don't know for other majors though.    As for teachers I had Dr Shepler and she was great :) I also had Dr. Schurmeier. Both were fair and flexible and funny. Schurmeiser is funny in lecture and treats you like a peer but honestly it was because she had a smaller class in 1211 and 1212  Either way it isn't too bad as long as you pay attention in class and do the webassigns, good luck :)"

gatech,3clnoz,mohit3,17,Wed Jul 8 21:40:31 2015 UTC,17 hours for your first semester is quite a bit. I would definitely keep it around 14-15 hrs for the first semester then go up or down from there.

gatech,3clnoz,Darth_Puppy,4,Wed Jul 8 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"It is doable. The problem is you might burn out. The best advice I can give you starting out is to treat GT as a marathon, not a sprint. If you start off trying to run, you might get tired mid race, and burn out. Meanwhile, other students that maybe started with a lighter load, will catch up and win at the end, because you tried too much too soon. I have taken 17 credits, and even more than that in a semester, but when they say Georgia Tech is tough, it is no joke, it really is a very hard and long journey, so dont get burned out now. Get comfortable with it first semester at least."
gatech,3clnoz,algoai,5,Thu Jul 9 05:00:38 2015 UTC,If you are have the Zell Miller scholarship don't do it. You need to keep your GPA above a 3.3 . They will be checking after spring term regardless of credit hours so make sure you are above that. It will/should be easier to do if you don't take more than 12-15 credit hours your first term. If you take fewer classes (12-13)you could try and get in to research for credit. I'm not positive about it but I believe that if you do a decent job they usually give you an A.

gatech,3clnoz,Ice_Qb,3,Fri Jul 10 04:22:12 2015 UTC,I know it's possible because last year my son was a sophomore and he had a freshman on his team fall semester. I believe in order to do it for credit you have to find the research position before the end of drop/add so you can register for the credit. Unfortunately I don't have any idea how you go about finding the research position. Maybe some one else here could help you with that.
gatech,3clnoz,gtparent,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:00:27 2015 UTC,Ok. I think I will start contacting professors who do research in areas I'm interested. Thanks

gatech,3clnoz,furionking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:49:14 2015 UTC,Step it up in your summer semester   Who the fuck does that? Most people take like 6 hours in the summer because the classes have lots of crammed material.

gatech,3clnoz,Volacrity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"I personally don't take more than 16 during fall/spring or 9 during the summer. I took 16 my freshman year. However, those were freshman classes. I would never take that many hours in upper level classes. Lots of freshman classes are still in the wrote memorization phase. In those classes, I find that when one puts in the time, an A comes out the other end. For upper level classes, that doesn't apply nearly as much.   My advice would be to be sure that you get as close to a 4.0 as possible your first year. Your Junior and Senior year will have some very difficult classes coming  your way, and my general observation has been that GPA's slip during junior and senior years.  It also depends on your personal drive. I was never the guy in highschool who could intuitively look at a problem and just do well on tests without study. I worked hard in highschool. Honestly, in some ways highschool was harder for me than college. (Maybe not grade wise, but still) I was never the guy in calculus who could just look at a relationship and intuitively accept it. I needed to see a proof, otherwise I felt that it was bullshit. That attitude seems to have benefited me in college.   If I were you, I would try 15 hours, as that is an aggressive but manageable number of hours for a freshman.   Just my 2 cents. Good luck and congrats on getting in!  Edit: Also, if you are taking 1371 your first semester, be careful and work hard at it! My advice might also change depending on whether you are on scholarship, paying instate, out of state, etc. If you are on zell, I would try not to rush in and out of tech, as the extra time might be worth the extra time in internships and a higher GPA. If you are paying out of state, do what you think is manageable to reduce the cost of attendance, even if that means more hours."
gatech,3clnoz,thatdudewhost,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:25:32 2015 UTC,"That's silly. You're a freshman, and since it's your first semester here, I strictly advise you to take less than 17 credits. It doesn't matter if you're taking English/History/Language/Other Liberal Arts, all college classes (at Tech at least) require you to input a lot of hours and energy into the work. In fact, I know a lot of CS and Engineering majors who find the so-called easy History/English classes quite hard (and more importantly, Time-Consuming -- which you will find to debilitate your grades in other classes). So please, for the sake of your own sanity, take 12 or 13 credits and then go from there in subsequent semesters (if you want, increase it to 17 later, just not now)."
gatech,3clnoz,compsci17,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. You don't have to be sprinting out of the gate. You'd be smarter to get rid of one class and take the semester getting used to living at school, going to class, the rigor of classes, all that. You aren't going to win a trophy or do yourself any long-term favors by taking 17 hours in your first college semester."
gatech,3clnoz,trolledbytech,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"I took 17 hours my first year, but one was Gt1000 and the other was BME 1000, a pass/fail. If you feel like you might want to try it out the first week of classes is still during Phase II which means that you can still switch around and drop classes. If you want, you could go to the class and get the syllabus/talk to the professor and get a feel for what you would be getting into."
gatech,3clnoz,siegetalk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on what particular courses make up the 17 credits. Look into critique/IRB before choosing History and English.  In general you should be fine. If you plan to graduate in 4 yrs, that's like a normal course load. (unless you have tons of AP's)"
gatech,3clnoz,z03p,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  It depends on your classes and your professors, but especially you. I know some AE (their classes are generally harder than ME classes) who consistently take at least 18 hours/semester. I also know people who struggle with 14.   I would advise starting off with fewer credit hours, however keep in mind that you can drop/add classes for the first week of classes. Of course, classroom space is limited, so while you can always drop a class during the first week picking one up is trickier. Also keep in mind that you are a freshman and don't really know how different Tech will be for you than your previous academic experience. I would recommend staying on the safe side, at least for your first semester.  What classes are you taking?   A math class is likely to chew up a lot of time, whereas an English class is not likely to take up as much time. That being said, I have had professors where I didn't have to put too much time into math classes, and english professors who made me work quite a lot.   Sidenote:Don't take any class for granted as an easy A at Tech, even if it is. We have a lot of people do poorly in health class just because they don't take it seriously at all. If everyone kept good track of their assignments and materials, the amount of people not doing well in that class would be extremely low, however many people miss a lot of assignments and therefore do poorly."

gatech,3cm7to,rawr_imfierce,3,Thu Jul 9 00:17:40 2015 UTC,I liked Stanzione. He was a fairly easy A and a really nice guy.  Lecture was mandatory though but fortunately was fairly interesting.  I've heard he is slightly harder now though.
gatech,3cm7to,Zesoft,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:26:15 2015 UTC,How was the grade calculated? Was there a lot of group work? Any extra credit opportunities?
gatech,3cm7to,rdg00,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:02 2015 UTC,"No extra credit opportunities.  You occasionally worked in groups on an inclass assignment, but those were pretty straight forward and mostly used to determine if you were in class.  You are also required to participate in 4 hours of being a guinea pig (in research on campus) or writing a paper.  The 4 hours are pretty easy to do though if you get signed up for it early (I got mine done in the first month of the semester).  I wouldn't say the class is an 'easy A' but as long as you put in the effort and study, the tests aren't going to trip you up.  There were four tests in the semester, but they all were weighted equally (and weren't cumulative), but that may not necessarily be the same this semester?  You then get a homework grade for the online component that's worth the same as the tests.  Finally you have the participation points which are worth slightly less, but contains the in class work/research participation.  The key to the class really is just staying on top of the online homework, and reading through the text.  I did really enjoy the lectures and the class overall.  Even though I'm not a psych major, the material was interesting."
gatech,3cm7to,jimmy_gd_fan,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"I took Stanzione and loved him. His lectures are mandatory but interesting, and his TA's hold study sessions before every test where they basically go through question by question. Homework in online and takes about an hour each week. There is one paper, but its easy and very open-ended. Tests are 50 multiple choice and 10 short answer, which he gives you before the test. An easy A if you keep up with homework and get all the assignments done on time."
gatech,3cm7to,z03p,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"Stanzione. Can't say it's an easy A, but definitely not hard, and exams are straightforward. His lecture is good too."

The only school wide requirement for transfers that I know of is that they can't change majors until after one complete semester.  I was a DMath major my first semester. I changed to EE the second semester. I added CS as a second major that second semester also.  What major are you trying to change into?

gatech,3cln24,robert323,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:43:14 2015 UTC,CS minors do not get to register for major restricted classes during phase 1!  If you wanted to graduate with a minor in CS then yes it probably would delay graduation.  If you want to take CS classes then I would suggest adding CS as a secondary major.
gatech,3cln24,ryan31s,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"Wow I was not aware of that. That really changes things up :/ Okay on the other hand, is it possible to get a major override permit if you are doing a CS minor for CS classes (I realized that almost all CS classes are major restricted)."
gatech,3cln24,furionking,3,Thu Jul 9 03:49:23 2015 UTC,I am sure it is possible. Just go talk to an adviser. The problem is going to be actually finding a class to sign up for that has space. The CS department is already very crowded.  I personally don't have any experience as a CS minor. I was warned by my EE adviser that they have a lot of problems with CS minors trying to register for classes. So I just decided to do a double major. Now I am thinking about dropping my EE major and just doing CS!  Good luck.
gatech,3cln24,furionking,3,Thu Jul 9 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"It's complicated. Here's the way getting classes as a MS minor currently works:  Halfway through a semester (fall), email the class you plan to take the following semester (spring) to your advisers. You'll get a permit to register for just that class during the end of phase 1. All CS majors have priority over you. Typically you'll get to register the 1st Sunday of phase 1."
gatech,3cln24,furionking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:52:06 2015 UTC,So I guess then it's not too bad. It's still possible to get into these classes during phase one then. Thank you so much that's pretty relieving. I think I can stick with the minor then!
gatech,3ckfui,Spyboticsguy,4,Wed Jul 8 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"If this is linear algebra then you should absolutely take it as far as ""should I learn this material?"" is concerned. As for your specific situation with high school GPA and not being able to get an A in the course then I don't know what to say.   In general, don't be afraid to take a course just b/c you believe you may not get an A or whatever grade you are shooting for. Linear Algebra is an important topic, so I would encourage you to go for it.  If you are worried about proofs then pick up this book.  You can find a pdf online.  The first few chapters are all you will need to get started."

gatech,3ckfui,casey2161,3,Wed Jul 8 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should clarify, since this is a new course - this is Linear Algebra with Abstract Vector Spaces. The pre-test is here. It is equivalent to the last 2/3 of MATH 1502, with additional content and vector spaces."
gatech,3ckfui,Pigboy501,2,Wed Jul 8 23:08:33 2015 UTC,Depending on what you are doing in cs linear algebra can be very important. I took a proof based course for abstract vector spaces and it was one of my favorite courses I've ever taken here. I'm not certain how similar that class would be to this one but if it's anything like it then the class will be somewhat enjoyable. I wouldn't worry too much about the difficulty or not knowing much going into it. A lot of concepts will be taught like you've never seen them before
gatech,3ckfui,robert323,3,Thu Jul 9 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat too. I'm interested in pursuing either comp sci or math as a minor, so I would really enjoy the opportunity to take this course. However, a lot of the concepts in the pretest are ones that seem like very few high schools teach, and have little to no overlap with concepts tested on the BC Calc test or SAT test (such as set theory and proofs). So I find it strange that they would list those as pre-reqs to apply for the course... Maybe they're looking for people with the aptitude to score highly on those tests and that engage in studying more branches of math on their own? Anyway there's no harm in applying (seeing as only ~60 students will get invites), if you can see to learning the material on your own.  On a side note, does anyone know where to find solutions to the pre-test to check against once we finish it?"

Anyway, Bretscher's Linear Algebra with Applications is fantastic, and was honestly considerably better than the very good professor we had. For the proof aspect, just try some out. I don't know how much detail they're looking for within the class, but at least become familiar with proof logic and methodology if you haven't already."

gatech,3ck1f4,EpicSchwinn,17,Wed Jul 8 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"The honest answer is that your previous college performance isn't going to help you. UMUC, not much either.  The best way for you to get in is to try to network and make connections. Knowing people is better than knowing things... Leveraging your veteran status is a must on your application down the line.  Getting certificates from Coursera that could be mentioned in an essay or put on a resume will also help. It will show that you are taking academics more seriously.  Best of luck"
gatech,3ck1f4,cloudmurder,12,Wed Jul 8 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"I am an older transfer student (31 yrs old). I already had a bachelor's and a master's degree in an unrelated field. I decided to change careers so I applied to Tech.  You have basically no chance at admissions as a transfer applicant as it stands now. You will need to make considerable improvements in your GPA. This basically means getting all 'A's in all of the pre-reqs required for transfer admissions. Even with this I would say you have little chance based on the 2.5 GPA. A 2.5 GPA at some college in Tennessee is probably equivalent to a 1.0 GPA at Tech. This isn't good.  So, you are correct in thinking about RETP. I attended GPC for a short period of time to get some of my transfer pre-reqs out of the way. I would look into it more, but if you go there and complete the program with the required GPA then they will probably give you an admit.  However, you need to make sure that whatever it was that caused you to fail those other classes is no longer in your system. In order to be successful at Tech you need to be the top of your class at some smaller school. If you go to GPC and find that you are having a hard time keeping up then you may want to seriously think about if Tech is the best fit for you. GPC was very easy.   If you really want to do the GPC thing then I would suggest starting ASAP. That means moving to ATL of course."
gatech,3ck1f4,robert323,3,Wed Jul 8 15:54:00 2015 UTC,"Just a waning. Tech has been getting way stricter with their RETP admissions in the past few years.   At my home institution (dalton state), I have seen students with a >3.4gpa, all the required credits completed, and otherwise perfect, get denied.   Myself included, although they argue that despite having completed 6 full-time semesters at DSC, I do not have the required amount of credit hours.  Tech shows no mercy with that rule."
gatech,3ck1f4,TehWildMan_,2,Wed Jul 8 21:29:46 2015 UTC,Whats the deal with RETP anyway? I always thought that if you meet the requirements then they let you in. Obviously that is quite incorrect ...

It seems like Tech is no longer willing to admit the majority of qualifying RETP applicants, and will deny admission for the slightest of reasons.  That being said, I am on the really sour end of the stick.  I assumed completing 6 semesters at DSC, including all the courses listed on the ""course requirements by major"" and RETP charts, while maintaining a >3.3 overall and m/s gpa would be enough.  When I heard of the 30 credit hour rule, I pleaded for an exemption, but they did not change their minds.  At this point, there are no major-related courses and only a few usable electives that I can take at DSC."

gatech,3cgnyp,BigPeteB,3,Tue Jul 7 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"Georgia is weird and stupid about these things. Drivers licenses and vehicle registrations are handled at totally separate places.  Their reasoning is that vehicle taxes go to the county, so it's under the department of revenue, and you have to do it in your county of residence. While driving licenses are a state issue not related to taxes, which is why you're allowed to test at any place in Georgia.  But this is stupid, because obviously almost everyone who has a car also has a license, and vice versa. Why bother separating them? It just creates more work for everyone.  Anyway, no, you don't need a Georgia license to register your car in Georgia. But registering your car is a declaration of intent to establish residency, and by law you need to get a new drivers license within 30 days of becoming a resident.  Whatever, point is, it's complicated. Students are exempt from needing to change residency. Take advantage of it and avoid the hassle."
gatech,3cgnyp,tunaman808,2,Tue Jul 7 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"Could be worse. Here in NC, driver's licenses and vehicle registration are also two separate offices. But the driver's license offices don't have separate ""lost\renewal"" lines like the ones I went to in Georgia. So if you have 10 teenagers ahead of you in line waiting to take the road test, you're gonna be there all day.  Even stupider, you must have INSURANCE to get a license in NC, regardless of whether you actually own a car or not. Say you move from NYC to Charlotte. You have a valid NY license, but you don't own a car, because you used to live in NYC. You can't transfer your license here in NC until you have insurance, so you have to go to an insurance agent and buy a $25 weekly policy, just to get your damn NC license."
gatech,3cgnyp,SparkPlug3,2,Wed Jul 8 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"Technically, if you want to get a license, you are supposed to get it in your first 60 days of ""residency"" or pay a fee. I got mine late my first semester and there was no fee. There is a little bit of paperwork for the plate and you have to get an emissions inspection every year ($15-25) along with paying an ad valoreum tax (the birthday tax). Everything is due on your birthday, so try to do it a few weeks afterwards so you can skip the ad valoreum tax. I can give you more details in a PM if you are interested."
gatech,3cgnyp,chuckles65,3,Tue Jul 7 20:28:33 2015 UTC,As long as you're a student you are not required to get a Georgia vehicle registration or a Georgia driver's license.

It is a small subset of the student population, but nationwide it is affecting the employment and healthcare coverage of a significant subset of the population nationwide, including many students.  In general, the trend over the past few months has been that employers are cutting hours, not extending health coverage to additional employees, and this is just one example."
gatech,3cestj,gtmarvin,3,Thu Jul 9 21:49:44 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not that significant of a portion of American workers, and those who are having their hours ""cut"" are the ones already working close to the 30 hours/week line in the first place or already working part-time (it's more of an hours limit for most people who are affected). In this fivethirtyeight article, the author is basically trying to backtrack an article he previous wrote about how throughout the recession part-time employment has essentially stayed flat while full-time employment has risen, because a lot of people were using the data to say that the ACA was not having the effect you are talking about. He shows that the ACA is, in fact, having the effect you're talking about but it's very, very small. The reasons for this are aplenty, but the biggest are that significantly cutting hours puts a lot of strain on business and it actually costs them more money to fill in the gaps with new hires because hiring a new employee carries fixed costs such as training and productivity loss.   So no, it's not a significant problem. As everyone else, businesses are motivated by profit. In a vacuum with no other externalities, sure a business might cut hours. But in real life, there are consequences and costs for such actions and, in almost all cases, it's not worth it. And the widespread benefits of the ACA clearly outweigh any insignificant or barely significant negative consequences thereof.  FTA:   Only the people most likely to be affected by the 30-hours threshold, those who work between 25 and 35 hours a week. That excludes the vast majority of workers. About 80 percent of hourly employees work at least 35 hours a week and the health law has had no measurable impact on their working hours. That makes sense: Cutting back workers from 40 hours to 29 would be highly disruptive for most businesses. And in any case, most of them already get health insurance.  Even focusing just on the most affected workers, the impact has been small. In 2009, before the Affordable Care Act was passed, 9.7 percent of part-timers worked between 25 hours and 29 hours and 7.7 percent worked between 31 and 34. In 2013, those numbers were 11.1 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively.  There’s no way to say for sure whether the shift is due to the Affordable Care Act. It’s hard to disentangle the effects of the law from the effects of the recession and economic recovery, for example. But the timing is suggestive: The change in working hours appears to hit in the middle of 2013, as the major components of the law were beginning to take effect."

Last summer, I took an internship that was also paid through GT. The internship was 40 hours a week and I was planning on working another 7-10 hours a week at my part time job. Both are in different departments.  HR fought me on it, told me that I needed to formally resign from my part time position (my name couldn't remain on their payroll even if I planned on returning in the fall) and that I definitely could not work both jobs at once. Honestly, I don't know all of the details, but my part-time job department stuck up for me and I was able to hold both jobs. From what I was told, they proved to HR that I would not surpass the annual 1300 hours cap, even working year round (including breaks) at my part time job, so the insurance wouldn't have to be offered. I don't know how/why the 30 hours a week was not mentioned, just the annual limit.

They would work 40 hours per week to work on a professor's projects. For summer 2015 student employees are forced to be student assistants.  This is where the school requires that they be enrolled in a class. Students are limited to 20 hours per week of work and being forced to sign up for ""thesis hours"" classes. So instead of working full time during the summer as normal the school forces the students to sign up for a class, either paid by the student or by a professor's research funds, and the student partially works unpaid for class credit that they don't need. The school keeps the student employee under 1300 paid hours for the year and avoids paying for benefits but the school still receives the work output of a fulltime employee.    Now do you honestly think that a student is going to limit themselves to 20 hours per week?  What about international students who have no option to work anywhere except on campus?  Students are paid a monthly stipend and their hours are not tracked in any meaningful way.  What actually happens is that the student effectively works fulltime over the summer while getting paid for part time work.  GT maintains the fiction that they are part time employees and the student is grateful to have a job.  I think that GT needs to have a magnifying glass focused on these practices.  In the greater scheme of things it would really not cost that much to cover basic health insurance for GT student employees.  Maybe an additional 5-10% in fringe?"

An accountant probably calculated the cost and disagreed.   Maybe an additional 5-10% in fringe?   This is a massive dollar amount.
gatech,3cestj,ICanLiftACarUp,11,Wed Jul 8 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"Holy shit.  I just graduated, but without my other campus job I wouldn't have been able to pay bills or eat; plus I worked in research so that was a major resume booster.  I'm trying to figure out why the ACA is spurring this change?  Regardless, I think it's probably good that they're tracking hours more accurately, but they seriously either need to up the stipend to reflect the actual hours worked or adjust the 20 hour rule for SSMs.  I know plenty of other SSMs who had second jobs out of necessity as well."
gatech,3cestj,wiggins1313,7,Tue Jul 7 14:20:51 2015 UTC,30 hours/week or 130 hours per month for 120 days is considered full time by the ACA. It also raises the percentage of full time employees that must be covered every year until it hits 95%.  Sounds like they hit the point where they would either have to implement this rule or start covering people doing multiple jobs.

ECE 2026 is known to be a major weedout class that takes many hours each week. ECE 2031 is also very time-consuming during the final month. But most importantly, this is your first semester at Georgia Tech and no ECE student in their right mind would sign up for that schedule. Major classes here are no joke, and I guarantee you that your overloaded schedule right now is a HORRIBLE idea.   Also, are you sure you can take all those classes together (fulfilling all of their prereqs?)"

OP: As a new transfer I wold suggest taking it fairly easy. I would recommend taking ECE 2020 this semester. Have you taken Diff Eq? Probably. Then I suggest you take ECE 2040 (Circuits). ECE 2040 is a hard class, but it is something you want to get out of the way. Taking ECE 2020 and ECE 2040 together is very doable (I did it). I would then suggest you take something that interests you such as an elective or something. I took number theory and crypto my first semester as a transfer. It was a good course to go towards an elective.   About your work ethic. Maybe you didn't have to study b/c GPC wasn't a challenge for you. I went to GPC for a little while and it was very easy. However, I always stayed very busy. I would study stuff that wasn't above and beyond the easy GPC classes.  I'm not trying to jump on you here, but you will have to put in significant time studying in order to not become a statistic.  With FASFET occurring this week I can't help from sitting back and thinking about how many of these new freshmen are gonna crash and burn. It happens"

People who tell you it can't be done are just lazy. Plus how many hours is that class load you've got there? 13? I usually take 13-15 hrs per semester with a lighter load of 9 or so for summers. Everyone said the same things to me about taking certain tough courses together blah blah blah.

I am not an ECE major, I have not taken these classes.  It probably is going to be hard, much harder than the course load you took at GPC.  That said, the classes do not get easier.  If you use all of your electives this year, you will end up taking 17+ hours of all 4XXX major classes your last 2 semesters, or extending your time at GT significantly.  I say this as someone who took 18 hours of 4XXX AE classes last semester, and wished I had taken some of these classes earlier."
gatech,3ci58x,ryan31s,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:34:17 2015 UTC,Welcome! I retract my previous comment. First off look at the course planning map on the ECE website. You'll find prereqs on there. Yes those classes are very difficult. Test it out the first week and get a feel for everything. You can always drop within the correct date. Also make a back up plan with different classes like electives.

gatech,3ci58x,PhineastheGreat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:55 2015 UTC,Prof Comm is a sequence that you take that helps you write papers and present them. I haven't taken it yet. You don't need to worry about it right now.  Prob/Stat is the statistics requirement. There are several options. That could be a possibility for this semester.
gatech,3ci58x,ICanLiftACarUp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:25:48 2015 UTC,Prof Comm is a 1 credit class you take between ECE 2031 and Sr. Design.  Take ISYE 3770 for Prob/Stat. It's easier than the one in the Math dept. and you can also count the credit as Non-ECE engineering electives.

gatech,3ci58x,hippi345,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"Did you already do all of your electives? I think jumping into all of those ECE courses at once could be a challenge. They all build on each other in a way that taking all four of those can be a challenge. In particular, 2031 should have 2020 (or a similar digital design course) as a prerequisite. It will mostly take the exact principles that you learned in 2020, and teach you how to apply them.  Your second semester looks fine, but again those can be some intense classes. 2035, for certain, you cannot procrastinate on. It is mostly project based, and those projects have a lot of different requirements that you will not only need to accomplish the original task but also refine your code to meet those parameters. If they are the same as they were 2 years ago, you may at best get a 50% for completing it. The other 50% depends on the efficiency of the program (number of lines number of instructions executed, etc.).  Edit: my suggestions: post-pone taking 2031 until the spring. I don't think you can even take it right now - this says you must take 2020/30 and 2026/36 first. You may be able to take 2035 instead. Preferably, though, you take another elective or core that you don't yet have. I was taking electives and such up through my senior year. Also, is 2056 even a real class? Or did you mean 3056? In which case, don't take 3056 until you have finished at least all of the 2xxx level classes."

Transferring after your freshman year will not move you to a more prestigious or beneficial position.  You'd lose friends, have to plan your schedule to transfer to Mich, etc.  Seems like a huge waste of time.  Going to a CC, then UMich might be a financially sound move.  Your total savings could be > $40k and a 3.0+ should be a given.  Definitely something to consider and specific to your situation.  It seems your main concern with GT is the difficulty.  As most have said, you won't be alleviated of that by going to somewhere like UMich.  Many can, and most do succeed here -and you can too.  I'm personally against transferring after 1 year, but it's not my choice.  You have to consider which school is a better fit for you.  Michigan is huge, Tech is average.

gatech,3cedfa,stuck_to_my_pc96,39,Tue Jul 7 06:47:04 2015 UTC,"Professor here -- I probably get 100+ of these emails per year.  Maybe 200+.  I take on 1-5 undergrads per year.   How should I choose?  Put yourself in my shoes.  Here is some reality from my perspective.  A) when classes get tight starting mid-semester, undergrads will stop showing up - they will often choose the deadline over the more open-ended research project  B) even really productive undergrads will spontaneously disappear when an internship/job/partner/change-of-major come along  C) thus hiring blindly or based on an email or interview is, in my experience (16 years, over 100 undergrad researchers), a low-yield process with a lot of drop outs.   D) To deal with these issues, a few years ago I replied to such student emails with a one-page questionnaire and a sort assignment (could be completed in Matlab in 15-30 minutes).  Only 1 out of 5 or so students would ever respond to my questionnaire after I sent it.  Here is what affects how and who I hire:  1) it's not about having good grades.  It is about loving research and demonstrating an eagerness to learn.  I am looking for students who can convince me they love learning, discovering, and spending all night or weekend in the lab making something, discovering something.  No grade will reward that effort, but start early enough, and it will pay off for you in many unexpected ways.  2) personally, undergrads in my lab:  --- their interests match something we needs a student for (this is just timing -- out of your control)  --- have a GPA > 3.2  --- ask lots of questions and follow through with actions, not talk or speculation  --- are often intensely involved in at least one extracurricular -- shows they can commit, and balance commitments  --- start as sophomores.  Sometimes freshmen.  They have time to commit long term and see a project through.    --- I avoid hiring last-year seniors.  Even when well intended, many have ""fallen off the deep end"" their graduating term with grad school interviews, job interviews, and all the chaos associated with that big life change called graduation.  Not a lot of time to seriously dig into a project.   --- usually I had them in a class so I know something about their approach to working on projects and handling unstructured time, otherwise were referred by people whose opinions I trust (other faculty, grad students, staff)  What does not work  --- blind emails.  I get 100s. I might read them when I have both time and a student need.  But I often do not.  I try to reply to many.  --- badgering me to hire you when 1) I may not have any openings and 2) I do not have $$$ to pay you. Money and people and time are finite resources.  --- copying fancy-sounding research topics off my web site, tell me you are interested, and not being able to actually tell me what about it you find interesting or even fascinating.  Avoid the boilerplate unless you mean it.  What you can do  -- Find a professor's office hours or his grad students/staff and talk with them. Ask questions.  -- Many academic units have programs to match students to undergrad research.  See if your major does.  Some are designed to orient you into a year+ project"

gatech,3cedfa,gtmarvin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:42:19 2015 UTC,"you could apply.  MS students have a hard time getting hired, due to the fact there are so many PhD students looking, and they stay around longer.  But sometimes the right project with the right person matches up.

gatech,3cauwq,userfoundname,15,Mon Jul 6 13:47:28 2015 UTC,"Clery Alerts are only for ""ongoing threats"" to the campus community. This was probably a targeted killing and posed no active threat to the campus (of course, we can always debate this). This is similar to the robbery suspects that the GTPD arrested a few months ago; there was no alert sent because the suspects were arrested and posed no threat. Here's the language from the Clery Act:  ""Issue timely warnings about Clery Act crimes which pose a serious or ongoing threat to students and employees.  Institutions must provide timely warnings in a manner likely to reach all members of the campus community. This mandate has been part of the Clery Act since its inception in 1990. Timely warnings are limited to those crimes an institution is required to report and include in its ASR. There are differences between what constitutes a timely warning and an emergency notification; however, both systems are in place to safeguard students and campus employees."""
gatech,3cauwq,designtofly,4,Mon Jul 6 14:31:31 2015 UTC,I've always wondered why sexual assaults don't prompt Clery alerts.
gatech,3cauwq,OccasionallyWright,6,Mon Jul 6 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"They sometimes do. I think the standard the police use is whether there continues to be an active threat to the campus. Most instances of sexual assault occur between acquaintances, so as horrific as those occurrences are, the perpetrators are not assaulting random victims. In cases where the assaults are random, such as the November 2011 rape, Clery Alerts are sent out. Regardless of whether an Alert is sent out or not, there are other reporting requirements, so campus police still have a record of those assaults occurring and will include them in their required reports.  Again, the standard that is being applied both in sexual assaults and this murder is whether there is a threat to the campus population. In cases where the offenses are targeted in nature, police make the determination that an alert is not necessary. But nothing is being hidden. You can still see the reports and statistics of all offenses as specified by the Clery Act."
gatech,3cauwq,designtofly,2,Mon Jul 6 17:40:53 2015 UTC,"In that case a few months ago the suspects were arrested, hence no Clery act alert.  In this case the suspects are still on the loose.  I think an alert should have been issued."
gatech,3cauwq,tweakingforjesus,2,Mon Jul 6 16:25:20 2015 UTC,Its possible that response time is lagging since this seems to have been handled by APD.  I wouldn't be entirely surprised if we get a delayed one sometime tonight
gatech,3cauwq,Josh_Morton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out there ... this ""club"" is not in GTPD's primary jurisdiction. Generally speaking, If it is off campus, APD is primary. For those of you with any experience with APD, they are not the most responsive.   Secondly, as everyone else has said. There was no ongoing threat to the campus. There was no stated affiliation with the campus, the article mentions nothing about a suspect moving in the direction of the campus, and it was not a student who was attacked. If GTPD sent Clery Acts about every crime that happened in the surrounding area they would become as useful as Melissa Moore's emails."

The work's personally fulfilling and important to the product, and I still can't believe that it's going to be seen by tens if not hundreds of thousands of users. There's an open, inquisitive culture that encourages asking questions and learning as much as you can while being independent and trying as much as you can before asking for help.  It's going to be an absolute culture shock going back to Tech after being here. The way people approach problems, get shit done, and love what they do is so different than what I see back here.

I spend most of my day trying to inconspicuously browse the Internet.  It'll look good on my resume and I'll be able to dress it up for interviews in the future, but damn this is underwhelming and borderline degrading (it sucks to walk around and be a worthless member of the office).

Well... he's now at another school with a bigger, better job and I don't plan on transferring. Good news is that I get a lot of great experience using the analysis equipment at Georgia Tech, which makes me a more attractive prospect. It also helps that the company is full of GT alumni and current grad students who can make good references. Hit some roadblocks over the last few months, but things are going swell right now."

gatech,3c8y5k,GreyMX,15,Mon Jul 6 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"See if you think like that though then you will literally never have anything of note on your resume. You have to become active and do something in order for your resume to be of note. Sitting around with your hands in your pocket blaming your lack of work experience isn't going to help you get a job next year either.       CS clubs are far from overcrowded most of their memberships are just people that show up for the first couple of weeks and then stop showing up all together. I know for a fact that The Agency does tons of really cool projects that make excellent resume fodder. For example one of our new freshmen members this year was a major driving force on one of our projects. This project literally got 2 of our club members a job.       Research is absolutely something that can make your resume look amazing. It doesn't matter that other people also have research on their resume. What matters is that you have something on there that you can use to talk to recruiters passionately about. This alone can get you a job or at the very least an interview.      Interviewers and employers in general also don't expect you to have found something amazing or new at this age. If you have great that looks particularly amazing; however, they do care about your ability to solve problems and about your general competence with coding. I know for a fact /u/Josh_Morton got his job because he was redoing a problem that was already solved       I personally only got my internship because I worked on a project for the agency as well. Even though I didn't submit or contribute a ton to the project itself I did help in some ways and was able to show the recruiters a passion about solving problems. It's all about spinning what you have done in a super positive light. Even if your resume looks awful when you go to the career fair(trust me mine is pretty bad aside from the one project I have on there)."
gatech,3c8y5k,cyan_and_magenta,7,Mon Jul 6 04:48:47 2015 UTC,"If you're an undergrad, you don't need to be solving problems that aren't already solved.

At the undergraduate level, employers are mostly interested in seeing students demonstrate basic competence and being able to see a project with clear purpose developed to completion (or at least developed to being functional)."

Heck, if you made some crazy shit that everyone uses/a novel solution to a problem, you wouldn't be looking for an internship, jobs will come looking for you.   I landed a coop because of a C program I forked off someone and improved by a small amount. It's nothing complex, you just need to demonstrate that   a) you have enough creativity to make something that isn't totally ass   b) you have enough drive to work on stuff in your free time and apply yourself.  upvoted though, disagreeing with opinion =/= off-topic"
gatech,3c8y5k,embeddedGuy,3,Mon Jul 6 07:15:14 2015 UTC,"It's not just about being a member of a club or holding a leadership position just to have another line on your resume. I found that a lot of clubs around campus can give you enough to get started, so you'll have enough to be able to do your own stuff and create projects you'd be proud of.  Don't worry about doing something just because it's been done before—it hasn't been done by you yet. You don't have to find a giant open-source project to contribute to. Just find things you're interested in creating and see if there's any opportunities to code something that'll help you or someone else in some way. Pimp out your README.md's with screenshots of your projects, why you did it, and what you plan to do in the future. The more you show why your work matters, the better. And even if it doesn't, then show why it mattered to you.  Apologies if I sound kinda preachy or condescending, but these are some pointers that helped me land my first internship and make it.

gatech,3c9bbp,BigPeteB,25,Mon Jul 6 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a problem with your intentions, but you need to see the bigger picture here.   She doesn't want to ask her to leave because the roommate is very socially awkward and she feels bad for her kicking her out into the big scary world.   Look at this from the roommate's perspective... where are you supposed to go? That dorm room is your home. It is the only place you have that isn't communal, and even then it's shared with someone else.  It's not like someone's house or an apartment, where there are other rooms you can go to but still be ""home"" in a private area. When you leave your dorm room, the only other places you can go are communal public places.   I think it is totally fair for her to ask for privacy, I know I'd be comfortable asking any roommate of mine to leave   That's a bogus argument. Just because you think you'd be okay doing something (and you don't really know yet, since you've not yet had to live in dorms and share your private bedroom with a stranger) doesn't mean everyone else in the world is.  But don't go thinking it's ""fair"" to ask her to leave. She paid for the room and was assigned to live there. She has a right to use it as much or as little as she wants. She and your girlfriend both have an equal claim to time and space in the dorm room.  You do not. You are permitted in Georgia Tech housing as a visitor so long as all residents of that unit agree to allow you in, and there are restrictions on how long and how often you may stay. You are not given any right or privilege to expect privacy or any other benefit of living in said unit.   How should we approach this   Well, there is a bit of game theory here. Sort of a ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" thing. Presumably, the roommate might one day have someone of her own she wants to bring back to the dorm room, and would want exactly the same thing of your girlfriend that your girlfriend currently wants of the roommate.  But maybe she doesn't expect that to happen for a while, if ever, or expects to make alternate plans if it does, so don't assume it's in her best interest to go along with your request now. This is why you need to sit down and talk about it.  Which brings us to...   it's not great for our sex life   If you and your girlfriend are both unable to have a fairly simple conversation with a roommate to amicably negotiate rules and expectations for privacy and alone time, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO BE HAVING SEX!"

That or bring a wingman to serve a distraction. Hopefully the roommate can make friends with that person, and you can get a couple hours of alone time.   Obviously don't kick her out for five hours at a time, but definitely have your girlfriend talk to the roommate about letting her set some alone time with you. You guys are all adults, so there should be no problem with talking about letting you have some time to yourselves. Even better, do a ""You scratch my back, I scratch yours"" thing, make friends with the roommate or, like a said before, bring a wingman so the roommate willingly leaves and doesn't feel like she's just being swept to the side.

I know many people who also developed them at GT. I personally had a recurrence of a mental disease that hadn't been an issue for 5 years during the first semester I was there. I do believe that Tech has psychiatrists on campus at the Stamps facility. I don't know the cost, but Tech is slowly starting to acknowledge the issues of many students.   GT is called an ""Institute"" and not a university for a reason. The focus is solely on education. Many of the professors are hands off in there teaching style and expect you to do some heavy lifting on the hw problems you receive. Others are great teachers as well as professors and really try to do their best to support you.   On another note, you will be one of 4000+ students similar to yourself in terms of intellectual ability and (for the most part) work ethic. The professors will consistently give out grades in the 30-50 out of 100 range and then curve at the end without telling you what the cutoffs are. I had friends in a class where the first test's average was a 21 (this was the 1st ChBE course for sophomores). Overnighters are commonplace at Tech if you procrastinate or simply refuse to give up on a hw problem that is beyond the necessary learnings of the class.   In terms of support, you will find someone like you, that is one of the redeeming traits about Tech. There IS someone there who is like you and wants to hang out with you. You play Magic:The Gathering, there is a community for that; you like pokemon, there are plenty of people who play; you like sports, there are plenty of intramural teams; you catch my drift?  Tech is not a place where you will be shamed for what you do and who you are. Not knowing anything about you, I will say a few things about some groups. There is a very large LGBT community (there is a Coming Out day celebration every year) and there are plenty if groups for most minorities:Black/African American, Chinese, Japanese, etc.   Sorry for writing a novella, but I wanted to give you a view of Tech.   I ""got out"" in Summer 2014 (4.5 years). I did 2.5 years of research while getting my ChBE degree. I did graduate with highest honors (I apologize for this seeming like bragging, but I'm trying to give you some info about me so that you can decide how valid my views are). I made multiple friends for life and studied abroad 2x. I met my wonderful girlfriend, whom I have been dating for 5 years now. I got a great job doing R&amp;D at a large company. This company only hires undergrad R&amp;D from 5 colleges, which should give you an idea about the reputation Tech holds with employers).   However, the most important thing I can tell you based on your post is that IT DOES GET EASIER. After graduating, every single one of my friends and I have said that working is much easier than Tech. Remember that. Tech prepares you for anything. There is a large, bright light at the end of the tunnel. In fact this should be true for any tunnel you choose, but I only know about Tech. I hope this helped, and please let me know if I missed anything.   EDIT: Institute, not Institution...aannnnd I can't grammar/spel wards"

Tech students also like to complain in solidarity with each other because yeah, there's moments/projects/weeks/classes that can suck.  But at the end of the day, you get out what you put in; no top-tier education on par with Tech is easy.  The complaining happens because it's a way to relate to and sympathize with classmates. When you walk out of a test thinking ""what the hell just happened?"" there's probably at least half the class thinking the same thing.  The Curve is love; The Curve is life.  And graduating GT puts you on solid ground for post-college life. It teaches you how to manage drinking from a fire-hose of information and work ends up less stressful than school was.  Don't get intimidated by the warnings of misery because day-to-day life isn't miserable.  The best part of a project that takes dozens of hours is clicking Submit and shouting ""I'm done!"""

gatech,3c4vk1,gayrights420,3,Sat Jul 4 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Background: I've been living with depression and anxiety disorder since middle school, but it was never really diagnosed and properly treated until I got to college. During my 2nd semester at Tech, I broke down and almost failed out.  I have 2 points about the mental health resources:   I went to the counseling center and met with someone there 3 times; it did not help and actually made me feel worse. IMO, if you have a really serious mental health issue and are not receiving any other help (or if you've never been told what illness you have), the counseling center alone may not be your best option. I know a few people who have had success meeting regularly with both the psychiatrist and counseling center. (you do have to pay after a certain number of visits though) Getting a psychiatry appointment is tough. A lot of people come into Tech already knowing they will need to meet regularly, and book ahead of time. The soonest time available I could get was 3 weeks out and conflicted with my schedule. I eventually gave up trying to schedule an appointment and stopped seeing the counseling center; fortunately the semester was almost over, but I would not have taken any chances earlier in the semester.    That summer, I went home and got treatment. Sophomore year, I changed majors and did much better. I am on medication and during the school year, every 2 weeks, I have a meeting with my therapist over the phone.  The thing about Tech (or any school) is, you need to be thorough and establish good habits. If you cannot dedicate a decent portion of your energy toward your coursework (whether it be because of mental illness, distractions, etc.), you will not do well. When I say ""energy"", I don't mean time- just think quantity over quality. You can stare at your notes and textbook for 10 hours a day, but if you can't focus or are plagued by depressed thoughts and lack of motivation, those 10 hours are worth less.   No matter where you go, I recommend seeking help before entering college. The more information you have about your condition, the easier it will be for the counseling center/psychiatrist to help you. Also, medication is tricky- it took the whole summer for me and my psychiatrist to work out a good medicine/dosage. If you decide to take that route, I would not recommend this process during the school year."

I'm way better but I have these moments where I 'dip' occasionally and so I'm looking for some service or club or meeting that can offer help for those moments."

gatech,3c4vk1,epicentre121,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"I want you to take this with a grain of salt. I've had several (mental/emotional) issues and learning how to relax has always been the best solution for me. In my opinion psychiatrists pretty much take shots in the dark that oftentimes hurt you, but please keep in mind that medication does help a lot of people. But I would look into lifestyle changes first.   I would recommend trying to ease into your program of study and joining a student group of something you're interested in.   Keep in mind that everyone struggles and that at the end of the day you always have a variety of options to get through school. Dropping out of classes isn't uncommon here, so if a professor is really grinding you then don't feel too pressured to deal with it all. I wouldn't recommend giving up easily, however there is a certain point that people reach where focusing on other things is the best option.   Also, I know it may sound cheesy but exercise can also help with stress a lot of the time, if that's what you're dealing with.  Counseling at Tech seems to be becoming a more common topic of discussion, so I think (but don't know) that there are improvements in counseling taking shape at Tech."

gatech,3c4vk1,epicentre121,3,Sun Jul 5 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"The stress/difficulty level at Tech is what separates top-tier schools like UC Berkeley/CalTech/etc. from lower tier schools like UGA/GPC/GA Southern. Tech is hard and stressful, but so are those other top schools, there is nothing that special about Tech's stressfulness. It is not some special place that tries to kick you down and stomp on you.   You just don't see a bunch of people at other top places whining because to get there you have to be extremely competitive and hard-working just to get in, so the students knew what they were going for, while until very recently Tech's admission standards were way lower than that of comparable universities, which led to a lot of people, who no way in hell would've gotten into other top universities, attending Tech and getting bitch slapped by academics.   If you think you are good enough to go to a top school, then go to Tech. If you are ok with settling for mediocrity (which there is nothing wrong with), go to UGA/GA Southern/etc.  EDIT: yeah, and as other people pointed out, Tech happens to have this weird complaining culture amongst some groups of people (and also Business major bashing culture amongst a lot of engineers, which is immature and really stupid). No one likes to be around people who just whine all day about how mistreated they are by Tech's academic requirements while they procrastinate on homework by playing videogames or aimlessly surfing internet for 8hrs+ a day, so if you do that, then please man-up/woman-up/other-kin-up and stop this annoying bullshit."

Culture of competition is when you are competing against other students, and that is not the case at all. In fact, I noticed that people are really nice and willing to help the other person out, since both of people will benefit from it (with the one helping out getting to understand the material even better).

I've heard stories about other schools where things are so competitive that other students sabotage the work of other students, and I think that's what's being referenced here.  I feel obliged to mention that in ME 2110, a class where  significant chunk of your grade is based on how well you do compared to your classmates, we'd all be working in the same lab and we'd help each other out. We were literally helping the people we'd be competing against by giving them materials, tools and reminding them about competition rules. My team didn't do great but we made friends and I still managed an A."
gatech,3c4vk1,trolledbytech,2,Tue Jul 7 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"I've always grown up with/around people who have taught me that anything is just as stressful as you make it out to be, and I'm so glad for that lesson. I've had a ball my first year. I think the most stressed I felt was one lovely afternoon right on the day that Spring Break began, when I somehow managed to sleep through 2 midterms. These weren't early morning midterms, they were at noon and 1 pm respectively.   Plus remember, everyone around is going through the same rigor and intensity so it helps to talk to people around you. Especially those people who are relaxed and coasting through. They can sometimes be the biggest confidence boosters.   I took 18 hours both my first and second semester, and didn't really feel overwhelmed at any point. You'll be fine."
gatech,3c4vk1,ilovebuttmeat69,4,Sun Jul 5 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"If you go to community college you will still find people complaining about all the work they have to do, and how they dont have time, or how this one teacher is just impossible, etc... complaining is a habit that isn't just magically developed when a person enters college. People who complain in college have learned to act like that from parents or other people earlier in their lives. Its not a reflection of the culture that they're currently in.  Everyone at Tech is a ""village hero"" tbh... the environment here is different in that the combination of hours required to understand any given topic increases, as well as the number of topics needed to be understood. You will also have to develop the skill of self learning, and you will have to put effort into getting group study sessions together when in HS it was done automatically or not needed.  There are a lot of people here and everywhere who are depressed or just dont enjoy life very much. I used to be one of those people but I just kind of got over all that as I began to understand what I wanted out of life and how my current interests and aspirations were combining with my body chemistry to make me miserable... its a personal thing for someone to go from wanting to jump off every building they walk into to having good grades, a great resume, people who you care about and who care about you, and a clear identity where you understand yourself and the direction that you want to have in life... but its doable. Plenty of people do it, but how long it takes a person may vary...  Personally, I used to want to just get all of the work and studying in my life ""over with"" so that I could move on to what really mattered... but thats a strange mentality to have. I may not love learning, but there are definitely things in my life that I want to know (languages, skills, academic topics.... whatever). Ive changed into someone who accepts that work is going to be part of my life because changing yourself requires time and work. It just requires a different perspective and taking time to understand that youre going to have to work to survive on this world (unless you want to live on welfare, which plenty of people in Atlanta do!).. take this fact and decide how you want to personally meet these goals.  Dont be overwhelmed by your current situations, and be able to focus on the little tiny pieces that eventually lead to where you want to be. Plan out stepping stones for your broader life goals, and focus on how to get to the next stone, rather than continually worrying about the 50th stone down your path and all the alligators swimming in the river between you and that stone...  Whether you come to tech or not, you can find success and achieve long term goals through just being a persistent fucker and working to obtain the things you care about. So honestly ask yourself, what is important in your life? If it is waking up in the morning and not feeling anxious, then go find a counselor to help you. If that one sucks, find another. If that one sucks, find another. IF you look around you, there are a lot of people who have settled or given up in areas of their life (or in every area)... I have made so many dumb choices in life, but Im far ahead of a lot of my peers just cause theyre honestly lazy and give up after they cant do something the first or second time... I dont think Im the smartest person in the world or anything like that, but I just fucking hate losing so much and want to travel and have a financially stable family so bad that I cant think about anything but studying and getting a 4.0 next semester, and going home after work to study the language I want to learn, and then work out to get the body that I want..  Idk yo, just focus on feeling good about yourself every day. Pick a direction and stick with it until you have to change a direction. Find good people and make an effort to keep them close to you. You have like, 80 years or so being alive... so spend time when youre young to plan what the upcoming 60 (the actual fun years) will look like.  Gl with whatever you do."

It takes more work than other schools in the state (more self-discipline to actually get your work done, at that) but it's not some impossible task.  Just remember that thousands of students graduate each semester. It can be done, you just have to keep your priorities in order."

You're not going to be asked to perform open-heart surgery on your first day -- you're going to learn calculus, physics, and English, in a normal progression from where you left off in high school. It's just tougher than if you were to do it at georgia or Georgia Southern or Valdosta State."
gatech,3c4vk1,top_procrastinator,2,Sun Jul 5 16:08:43 2015 UTC,Lol @ comparing high school workloads with gt workloads
gatech,3c4vk1,epicentre121,2,Mon Jul 6 01:16:48 2015 UTC,"Umm, let me start with a P.S.: Don't call it ""GTech"". Call it ""GT"", ""GaTech"", ""Tech"", or ""Georgia Tech"".  Is Georgia Tech stressful? I think the only correct answer is yes. It's well known for its academic rigor. Typically, students who come to Tech after being straight-A students in high school without having to put much effort in suddenly find that instead of being above-average, they're now average or below-average students. Some of them never developed skills for taking notes, completing difficult projects on a tight deadline, or studying for tests, and aren't able to learn these things at Tech before they fail out.  (This reminds me of some jokes/stories I heard people telling prospective freshmen to illustrate how difficult things are at Tech. Such as, ""A lot of freshmen panic when they get their first test back and they got a 75. But it's okay, because the class average was probably a 68, so you're actually doing well!"" Or, ""You can tell people whose parents went to Tech because they call home and say, 'Mom, I got a 53 on my Calc3 test!' and she says, 'Great, I'll hang it on the refrigerator.'"")  Georgia Tech is also hard compared to other ""hard"" schools. MIT also has a reputation for being extremely difficult; they refer to getting an education from MIT like ""drinking from a fire hose"". But MIT is still a private Ivy League school, with all of the perks that brings. Such as: being able to drop classes right up until finals week; dead week actually being dead, with no classes or projects and just a solid empty week to study for finals; being allowed a full week after finals just to relax and move out of your dorm at your own pace. By comparison, Georgia Tech is, frankly, even harder; there's just a lot more stuff outside of classes that contributes to your stress level.  That said, I think stress at Georgia Tech is manageable. Yes, sometimes you may feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of time-consuming projects that are all due at the same time, plus having to study for tests and finals. You need to have good time management skills, so that you know how to prioritize things so you don't fall behind. You need to be motivated enough to keep on top of work; if you slack off and let yourself fall behind, it will be difficult to catch up.  But you're not in this by yourself. You have friends who you can comiserate with. When you're feeling stressed out, find someone to talk to, just to bitch about all of the crap you have to do and how it feels like too much work. They'll sympathize, and maybe they can help you come up with a game plan for how you'll get all that work done: which projects you should focus on, which ones will be the hardest or take the most time, which ones it's okay to neglect, etc.  There are also lots of clubs for whatever kind of stress-relieving thing you want to do. (They're also a great way to meet friends who you have a common interest with besides just school.) I was in choirs for 10 years, and one of the things our director always remarked on is that all of the singers were there because we wanted to be there; for us that club was something we did for fun, to relieve stress."
gatech,3c4vk1,el_petros,2,Sun Jul 5 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"i think Gatech has a long way to go before it can be compared to MIT. MIT's open courseware has illuminated me. The professors there are inspiring, great communicators, and make me want to learn. I have yet to have such an experience at Tech with any prof, but hey, maybe next year I will. I think (this is my opinion of course) that Gatech needs to realize that harder != better. The way gatech makes stuff is hard is by having professors who can't really communicate well (foreign accents, poor handwriting, don't really care about teaching [e.g. I had a prof this spring who on the first day of class said I'm only here for the money, he ended giving only 20 people A's in a class of 187.]). So I agree with most your points, but sometimes it really does feel like Tech is out to get us."

I had to study significantly more for the tests and the final.  edit: also, schuster's grade distribution wasn't even as harsh, and people tend to complain about him a lot for orgo 1  edit2: Also orgo is meant to weed people out, people who weren't wed out by gen chem, so I guess it makes sense that it's harder than physics 2"

For instance, at MIT, majors are referred to by number, ordered somewhat but not entirely by the order they were added to the school. So Biology is Course VII, and the intro Biology course is VII.101. Why such an opaque scheme that requires rote memorization? As far as I can tell, ""because fuck you"".  Actually, getting back to my original point (that GT is hard), I think you're making my case for me. If the professors at MIT are better at teaching and easier to understand, doesn't that make MIT easier than GT? Like you say, ""sometimes it really does feel like Tech is out to get us.""  Whatever; it's beside the point. We could debate back and forth about whether MIT or GT is harder. Ultimately I don't think it matters, since the question at hand was ""Is GT stressful?"". The answer is yes. MIT is also stressful. I don't think anyone's going to argue that, either.  We could also debate back and forth about whether GT or MIT is ""better"". We probably wouldn't be able to come up with a good answer; we probably aren't even qualified to judge, since we only have experience with one of the two."

gatech,3c4vk1,s0cialjusticewarrior,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"Look, I am gonna be really honest. Tech can be great, you will learn a ton, the material is very challenging. I always thought I was very intelligent person, but still Tech makes me feel stupid/dumb many times over. Of course, when you get out of Tech, or talk to others, then you realize you are good/capable, but when you are here, sometimes it is easy to forget, since you are comparing yourself with some of the smartest and most competitive people in the nation. I have never been a person that has had depression, but I have to admit that the difficulty of Tech is very stressful, is the truth. Even by studying a ton, sometimes it is still not enough, and if you get on the wrong side, it is very very easy to get frustrated, and can get in the mentality where you do not want to even try anymore. However, when you do graduate, if you are able to pull it off, it does feel great. I graduated from undergrad here, and after all the pain and admit that I suffered a ton here, I felt good after. I somehow decided to do the B.S./M.S. here and now feeling again bad while I am here, but I know when I get out I will get a sense of accomplishment that will be worth it in the long run. So in short, it can easily get very very stressful, sometimes you feel there is no time to do all you want, but at the end it is worth it in my opinion. Not wanted to sugarcoat the thing, and hope it helps."

You can get a cheap functioning laptop and stick an SSD in it or you can spend more of your budget and get something thin, light and portable with great battery life. Whatever you get doesn't even have to meet Tech's requirements since you'll have the desktop for any heavy lifting (not that there's a lot of that in CS). You can even get a tablet or Chromebook if your major concern is just taking notes in class. For whatever it's worth, I consider laptops in class to be overrated and more distracting than helpful, but that's an opinion rather than a fact.

gatech,3bzsd7,chaosking121,2,Fri Jul 3 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"That's actually a very respectable response. Learning is a continuous thing and we're all constantly figuring out more and more. Sorry for being so snarky about it.  I think you're really overestimating the demand of coding. Practically speaking, if it has a text editor, it can code. I don't think you can really go wrong with any modern processor that isn't built for like ultra low power use. I've heard that eclipse guzzles up memory very quickly though, so keep that in mind. With that established, maybe start looking at the other aspects of programming. In particular, if you plan to code extensively on this machine, pay particular attention to the keyboard. If at all possible, try it out in real life to figure out if you'll be fatigued typing extensively on it or if poor decisions were made in laying out the keyboard. Historically, ThinkPads have been known for their excellent keyboards but I've suspected for a long time that their quality has been slipping lately. No matter what you choose, make sure and read reviews for that particular model. There isn't any golden brand that never fails, so you'll have to do your research.    You still have a few options so I don't think it would be best for me to lay out any particular models until you narrow it down a bit more. I haven't done much reading into any current laptops with great keyboards because I plan on brining my Mechanical Keyboard with me to Tech so I can't offer a wealth of advice there other than I'm fairly satisfied with the ""SteelSeries Designed"" keyboard on my MSI GS60."
gatech,3bzsd7,russianzilla,4,Fri Jul 3 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"You become more reliant on raw computational resources as you hit the upper level CS classes. As projects become more complex, some people tend to transition to using IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ, plus Android Studio and Xcode if you plan on doing mobile development. You'll also want a nice reserve of RAM when you have to use virtual machines for 2110 (and potentially other classes depending on your threads). Technically you could just dual boot, but most people tend to go the VM route to save some time and hassle. Otherwise, yes, it doesn't matter all that much.  I would, however, make sure to look for something light enough to lug around with you. Also, be sure to either buy something with a comfortably sized display or have an extra monitor on hand, because there are few things more unpleasant than having to code on nothing but a tiny screen."
gatech,3bzsd7,chaosking121,0,Sat Jul 4 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"OP's got a beefy desktop for most of those things. I wouldn't imagine he's just going to completely ignore it and work solely on his laptop so his requirements on the laptop itself don't need to be as high. However, you bring up good points for others like myself who aren't able to bring a desktop to Tech."
gatech,3bzsd7,BigPeteB,0,Sat Jul 4 02:54:21 2015 UTC,I have a mechanical keyboard as well and I love it.
gatech,3bzsd7,chaosking121,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"Coding doesn't require much CPU. Once you get into the real world where applications can be millions of lines, it sometimes matters, but school projects will never be that big. Even a dinky low-power mobile chipset will be plenty.  RAM is very important. It lets you do more things simultaneously without slowing down. It lets you run memory hogs like anything written in Java (including Eclipse and IntelliJ). It lets you run multiple virtual machines. If you have to pick between more RAM or a better CPU, pick the RAM.  The only exception might be if you get into graphics in your 3000- and 4000-level classes. Then you might end up needing to do some heavy rendering that can be CPU intensive. But that's a few years off, and you've got a beefy desktop for it. Moreover, you also have access to computer labs that will have equipment that might be better than either of your machines."
gatech,3bzsd7,T_Herdina,0,Mon Jul 6 18:11:48 2015 UTC,What does anyone think about the lenovo Yoga 2
gatech,3bzsd7,chaosking121,0,Fri Jul 3 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of the few laptops I have experience with. A friend of mine got one during a trip to the US and I got to try it out when he got back.   There are quite a few different models but as a general rule of thumb, if it has an i5, it's good to go for programming. Bonus points if it's Skylake Broadwell (Intel 5th general, will look like i5-5xxx). Try to maximise RAM and SSD size because you won't be easily upgrading them on a Yoga 2.  As for the actual product, I was very surprised by how light it was and how sturdy the build quality was for something that thin. You're going to have to look up battery life individually for the models you're interested in, but for a portable machine than can power through most tasks (including programming), I think it's a good choice. The actual gimmick of being able to turn it into a tablet is just that: a gimmick. You might never actually use it simply just because of how cumbersome it is to handle a 12"" ""tablet"".   Tl;Dr: decent choice for light and portable machine. You'll need to do more research on things like battery life and keyboard quality but it should be fine for programming."
gatech,3bzsd7,shred45,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, Broadwell cpu's are 5XXX, skylakes are 6XXX and have not been released."

gatech,3bzsd7,chaosking121,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:06:40 2015 UTC,Skylake is 6th generation and will not be out until the end of the year at the soonest. Perhaps you mean Broadwell?

gatech,3bzsd7,chaosking121,0,Fri Jul 3 23:06:52 2015 UTC,I know lenovo is having a 4th of July sale so what do you think of this model here http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/yoga-laptop-series/yoga-laptop-2-pro/#59428037 I think it looks really good for the price.
gatech,3bzsd7,gooseneckn,0,Fri Jul 3 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you mean the $900 one. That's a really good model for the price if you ask me. 0.6 inches thick and 3.1 lbs is super portable (and it's ultrabook territory).  Regarding the screen, it's gonna be super crisp but you'll have to rely on subpar Windows text scaling for it to be readable. On my 1080p 15.6"" display I already have some problems regarding the readability of text in some places. 1800p at 13.3"" is gonna be harsh until Windows improves their high-dpi support (which has to happen eventually).   As always, you should research real world battery life and build quality and stuff by checking some owner threads or YouTube videos but on paper everything looks good."

All of you have been right I have always gone for the best of the best but here that is sometimes unnecessary fluff and I have a pc with the power to run anything I need it to so I believe that this laptop is the right one for me.

I'll answer here while I'm at it.  I ended up getting the MSI GS60 Ghost Pro 044. I do have a PC that I built last year here at home, but I'm an international student so I won't be able to bring it with me. I wanted a laptop that was thin and light, but still powerful enough to handle any game I want to play and this was it. Battery life isn't great, but that's just the trade-off I needed to make.   Oh and I'm an incoming CS freshman as well, so if you wanna add me on Facebook or Steam, feel free to go ahead."

The website said 4:30pm but in reality the time was 5:00pm and they screwed it up. I went to the appeals meeting, showed them the ticket timestamp, showed them the website (still incorrect), and said it's not my fault they published incorrect times. There's no way I should know it's 5:00pm. They upheld the ticket. I went straight to the parking office and told whoever was at the counter what happened. I told them I was 100% never going to pay it and that if they tried to keep me from graduating years later I'd get more people involved. The website was updated by the time I got back to my dorm.  TL;DR That group sucks. Fight everything. Refuse to pay even if they don't throw it out. You should not be punished for someone else's incompetence."

gatech,3bvkbq,BigPeteB,24,Thu Jul 2 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"Also its important to realize that people view these dorms differently as they get older. I was in Smith as a freshman (6 years ago), and if you were to ask me about Smith now I'd say it was kind of shitty. The rooms were small, it had tile floors, and tight community showers.  However, I can honestly say that none of those things really bothered me as a freshman. I only really noticed it as I got older and my living situation improved. Sure it seemed kind of lousy compared to North Ave, but it stacks up perfectly well to what your freshman peers at other colleges are getting. Everywhere is good, living in Atlanta is tight, you'll likely enjoy yourself wherever you go.  Although, you'll never get to enjoy Smith quite like I did, because you won't be living across the street from Wingnuts ;)"

Because you have an entire semester to put in work and stay motivated for it's more of a challenge than if you're just pumped and working for a weekend or few days. I've led multiple projects in VGDEV as well as worked on others. If you're new to learning about game development stuff there is always projects and people that will be willing teach you about related stuff. My only complaint as a project lead is people dropping out mid / end of the year (due to workload though so understandable). But the club leads helped me out and put me in touch with other members that could help.   As a club we don't do game jams but there is a game jam at SPSU that many members go to (I haven't been yet but I'd like to go). It's about a 30 min drive away from tech.
