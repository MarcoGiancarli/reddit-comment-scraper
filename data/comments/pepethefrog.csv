pepethefrog,379009,talto17,2,Tue May 26 05:50:14 2015 UTC,The exquisite detail and complexity of this piece is enough to demand a couple millions. Overall I'd  say something in the neighborhood of $40 - 50 millions would be it's minimum value on a bad day. If I were you I'd call Sothebys or Christies  auction house for a more accurate appraisal.

So you have to take it upon yourself to scrape rare pepes from the depths of the internet, occasionally even having to make your own to compete with other collections like this anon did:  http://imgur.com/imtAncJ  The pepe market is also extremely volatile and dont expect ANY rare pepe to stay rare for even a few hours, its something you have to understand when getting into some hardcore underground shit like collecting pepes.  We welcome you to the pepe trade, but expose our pepes to a normie, and well, lets just say that things will happen to you."
