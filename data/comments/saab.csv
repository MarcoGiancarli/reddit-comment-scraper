saab,3e2vb3,Turdsworth,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:57 2015 UTC,I run ebc red stuff and ebc standard rotors on my turbo x. Works great.
saab,3e2vb3,eatsonthetoilet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:30 2015 UTC,Will I need to change the rotors to change the pads? People in reviews complain about the noise. How loud is it after break in?
saab,3e2vb3,b0xdestroyer420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:04 2015 UTC,You should replace the rotors as well since the wear will be uneven. I also have ebc red stuff pads and the ultimate slotted rotors.
saab,3e2vb3,tonym978,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:27 2015 UTC,I cheaped out and bought callahan rotors and brakes on Amazon because my car will be going into storage soon. Don't buy them. They are fine for my purposes as a temporary commuting solution but certainly for performance I'd go back to oem.
saab,3e2vb3,PoorRichGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"Akebono are the pads you should select.  Low dust, good stopping power.    Not cheap, but high quality for everyday driving."
saab,3e2vb3,athauglas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"Akebono made the pads I just removed, and I agree they were good quality for normal stuff. But a few good corners on a downhill switch back road, and they were finished. They just couldn't deal with the heat. OP didn't mention a specific concern but if it has anything to do with fade, it's time to upgrade."
saab,3e2vb3,athauglas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"I just finished doing brakes on mine a couple weeks ago. I got EBC plain rotors, yellowstuff pads, and goodridge lines (braided steel) to replace the old rubber ones. Total cost including a liter of very high temp fluid was somewhere around $650, doing the installation myself. The improvement in brake feel, bite, and fade resistance was exceptional, but the trade off is that the pads are very, very dusty and squeak a little under light application.  If you drive like a normal person and not a loony, you can make do with less extreme parts like redstuff pads, which are still a significant improvement over factory pads and don't dust anywhere near as badly.  But don't just replace pads, you need to replace the fluid and rotors as well, or resurface them if they're close to new."

saab,3dz78y,mailerdeemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, shoot. Thought it was at first just from the shape. Then I second guessed myself, thinking it might be a weird Renault or Citroen or something. Then saw the 3-spoke wheels and was reasonably confident in its Saabiness."
saab,3dz78y,mailerdeemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"Three bolt wheels give it away, but the c pillar vents are wrong, and the hood is a conventional panel rather than wrapping over the fenders."
saab,3dz78y,Easterbronx,3,Mon Jul 20 23:58:04 2015 UTC,That looks like a Renault 12?

saab,3dvfgu,Harmster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"Your aftermarket amp will have either line-level or speaker-level inputs, or both. If you intend to use the speaker wires as inputs to your new amp, then your amp needs to have speaker-level inputs, or you need to buy line-level converters before connecting anything. If your amp has those, just follow its installation instructions and adjustment procedure.  Make sure it's physically secured to the car. Don't be ghetto and let it float around in the trunk.  Also, I strongly suggest you replace the in-dash speakers as soon as possible. These are responsible for mids and highs, and due to proximity to your head (as the driver) and the fact that bass tends to get lost in road noise, the dash speakers will make the biggest difference in sound quality. Search this sub for my old posts about replacing mine for a decent staring place."
saab,3dvfgu,athauglas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking to put these on the dashboard: http://www.jbl.nl/jbl_product_detail_nl/jbl-gx302.html and these on the back in addition to the 6,9 http://www.jbl.nl/jbl_product_detail_nl/jbl-gx502.html"
saab,3dvfgu,athauglas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:24:28 2015 UTC,"Should be adequate! Just watch out for the depth on the 3 1/2"" ones. Or rather, the height of the speaker and tweeter above the flange. Space is very limited under the grille and you will probably have to trim some of the plastic. The Polk DXi speakers that I bought were the max possible height while keeping factory appearance."

They'll fit your car and are a great upgrade from your 285mm front brakes. All you need to buy are the 314mm dust shields (PN 13276089). I'm asking $240 shipped for the brakes on SaabCentral. :)"
