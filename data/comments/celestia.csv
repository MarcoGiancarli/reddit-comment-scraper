celestia,3bcdn6,Coelacanth0794,3,Sat Jun 27 21:51:41 2015 UTC,I love corrupted Celestia as a concept. What did it take to break her? What sort of personality does Solar Flare have? How is she stopped... or does Evilestia win?  Sadly I've yet to find a good fanfic featuring her and fanart is very rare.
celestia,3bcdn6,NEREVAR117,2,Sun Jun 28 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"Ironically the best version of evil Celestia I've found is in the Lunaverse stories. Not so much the first one that's just an alternate universe retelling of the show's pilot, but some later stories involving 'Corona' expand on the character pretty well.  Have we had this conversation before? It feels familiar."

Also the art is really nice. :p"

celestia,2c73jt,FomorianKing,1 point,Thu Jul 31 02:44:17 2014 UTC,I'd still buy it at a high price.
celestia,2c73jt,FaceDeer,3,Thu Jul 31 02:46:59 2014 UTC,"When I said old, I meant it hasn't been updated since 2010 or something. Unfinished notes on version 1.70 are still up 4+ years later. It was just the project/hobby of a couple of guys so life probably caught up to them or something. I remember using it quite a bit many years ago when I was a kid (2006-2009 ish). Back then it was still obscure but the community was at least active. Some add-ons dealt with higher quality textures and extra stars/asteroids, things like that. Other add-ons however featured fantasy solar systems from Star Wars, Star Trek, Avatar, and what not. Others yet came up with their own worlds, many equally as amazing.  There was one that was called ""Ran: The Billow Maids"" that was by far the best damn add-on in the whole damn site. It was the work of like a single guy who had too much time on his hands. In a software program that wasn't supposed to be more than an astronomy sandbox, he created a fantasy solar system with its own story line and shit. In fact, his story was so detailed and fleshed out that at times it seems he created the planets for his story line rather than a story for his planets. He also put a lot of research into it due to its references to Germanic/Nordic mythology, world history, and cultural refrences. It took great advantage of the program's time manipulation tools since you could jump to any point in the civilization's history from how it began with just a few individuals, became a sprawling civilization, how it fell on its knees during the Armageddon, and then built society back up again on another (terraformed) planet, this time stronger than ever. And that's not to mention all the wars, planetary exploration, large-scale economic projects, and Easter eggs you'll find along the way (if you can find them). He didn't focused solely on the story-line either, his planets and celestial objects were the best of any add-on hands down. His textures and atmospheric renderings were second to none and the planets, moons, nebulas, spacecrafts, etc, were actually creative and beautiful while still being realistic. And the most impressive part was, he used this program in ways it wasn't even meant to. His humans and animals for example had to be coded as satellites because it was an astronomy software for god's sake. My only qualm wad that he had an amazing project, but he did it on the wrong thing. I mean Celestia was too small/obscure/limited to do him justice. But then again, it is hard to think of where else he could have done this short of making his own game. Anyways, I digress.  Celestia' add-ons made the program. Kind of like how Minecraft's mods and TF2's servers extend it's shelf life by factors of dozens. Celestia's add-ons did require quite a bit of computer know how which 11 year old me didn't know much of. This was the main reason I forgot about it.   I come back years later after remembering it randomly during my long hours of thoughts. Now that I am older and studying software engineering in University, I think it was about time I come back to it and learn how to use/install add-ons properly, toy around with them, and take a shot at making my own. Much to my dismay, I see that the community and program have fallen into deeper obscurity and inactivity than even before. I tried looking for the community subreddit but it's too obscure for even REDDIT! /r/subredditsarehastags but not even Celestia has one. A damn supporting character on a pony-themed show is far more popular than the program! No offense... I just have to kind of accept things as it is I guess, and that the Ran Celestia add on is just one of those hidden gems of the Internet that I am lucky enough to have known.  Sorry for the wall of text BTW   Edit: Found a link to the add-on's promotional website. Lots of gorgeous screen shots.  It's called Memory of the Waves here but it does mention ""Ran:The Billow Maids"" was it's original/alternative name."
