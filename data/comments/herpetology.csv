Starting at 15:23 here, it shows the difference between the two.  I grew up in New Jersey, later moving to North Carolina and immediately noticed.  Similar, but definitely different.  That being said, I haven't been to a spot where I've heard both of these different calls.  I'm also not up to date on their respective ranges."

The thing is, it's a weird polyploid origin, so the species may have sprung up interdependently in multiple locations. We really don't know."

herpetology,3dzlsa,askantik,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Somers & Mathews (2006) - The Box Turtle Connection - will have everything you want and more if you're interested in just doing some citizen science on Eastern Box Turtles, including tools, mark/recapture techniques, sex & age determination, etc. Here's a PDF copy.    The book goes over this, but the tail and carapace shape are the ways I've always been taught to determine sex in box turtles. In males, the tail will be longer and the cloaca (anus) will be farther out from the body. Additionally, the shell of a female will be higher/more domed than a male; Image example (male on left, female on right).  Eyes and coloration aren't really a valid option; though most males have red eyes, there are females that have them, and coloration can be very hit or miss depending on the age of the turtle.  Calipers are fine for measurements; when I worked with them we took Carapace Length (Straight across: with calipers; & Domed: the full size of the carapace with a tailor's tape), Width (Straight & Domed), and Height (calipers), and Plastron Length and Width (with calipers). We also took weight (spring scale or small electronic scale can be used) and noted any shell damage. We used the common numerical marginal scute notching system; if you're trying to use photos be sure to take the photographs in relatively the same position each time. I would use a laminated sheet and dry erase marker to write the date, sex, etc., and photograph the turtle's carapace and plastron while it sat on the sheet. You can also use a paint pen and mark a dot on specific vertebral/carapicial scutes to indicate which month they were caught in, and maybe use a different color each year (the marks last a decent amount of time, not as permanent as notching but should be enough for your purposes).   There's been a lot of work done with Eastern Box turtles, so searching through the literature will give you a great knowledge base to pull from. Depending on which state you're in, keeping these kinds of notes and giving them to the local PARC or FWS can be useful for their conservation purposes. Definitely check local laws and permitting requirements as well, though I don't think you'll have too many issues with what it sounds like you want to do."
