Coilporn,3e4jfz,futuretrash,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:01:12 2015 UTC,"It's partly the challenge, but the lower resistance also gives more flavor and cloud. It can be dangerous if your using a battery not made for it.  I enjoy vaping at 3.6-4.6 volts, so that's like 100 to 150 watts on that coil."
Coilporn,3e4jfz,Alphonse121296,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:40 2015 UTC,Well how do you enjoy that voltage. Subohm is a battery drinker.
Coilporn,3e4jfz,eddie995863,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:33 2015 UTC,Charge the battery and keep spares. No ever said subohming that low is easy. Just building coils for that can be difficult in the beginning.
Coilporn,3e4jfz,Alphonse121296,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:29:26 2015 UTC,"The 26g wire heats up first, followed by the clapton to reduce ramp up time."

Coilporn,3e2d43,Miningmanpwn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:45 2015 UTC,What chip does it have?
Coilporn,3e2d43,Miningmanpwn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"It's cloupor's custom chip.  150w, nothing special.    See it came out about a month before the other 150w VW mods at the time, and its still the cheapest.  However, wattage/voltage accuracy isn't perfect.  But I'm not a competitive cloud chaser, so it does me super well.  I still think its better built overall than the Sigelei because the fire-button doesn't feels like an old-school arcade button, its a nice, comfy, solid click."
Coilporn,3e2d43,Miningmanpwn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:37 2015 UTC,I saw the 46 C on it and thought temp control. What does the 46 C on it mean??
Coilporn,3e2d43,Davadam27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:32 2015 UTC,Its temp protection. If it gets above 55c it won't fire to keep unit from damaging.  Ive never seen it over 50 though and this was right after i built some coils. Avg is about 40c .

Coilporn,3e2hh9,theycallmerood,2,Tue Jul 21 14:09:54 2015 UTC,"You kinda just have to wick it right and rejuice often. As you can see in the pic, both coils have burn spots in almost the exact same spot. It needs to be rewicked since it's clear it's not getting the juice it needs."

Coilporn,3dzg53,drewfromthefuture,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:34 2015 UTC,You can glow nickel. Just don't want it to happen while you're vaping on it. You have to work out the hot spots some how.
Coilporn,3dzg53,IKROWNI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:49 2015 UTC,The toxic effects are non existent after glowing it? I thought for sure I've seen multiple times that doing that would cause toxins to be released. I thought that was the reason why we didn't make contact coils?
Coilporn,3dzg53,drewfromthefuture,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"It's true that when the wire heats up too hot (I think it's 1200*F) it can release toxic gas, and red hot would probably be hot enough, but I'm pretty sure the gases dissipate. When the wire cools down they're no longer being produced thus safe to inhale using temperature control."
Coilporn,3dzg53,crappy_guitarist,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:23 2015 UTC,how the fuck did you do that?  that shit is insane
Coilporn,3dzg53,Grannybanger,5,Mon Jul 20 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Used straightened 20ga aluminum wire sections for a jig. Wrapped one coil, then put a 2nd 20ga wire section parallel to it, wrapped another the opposite direction then twisted it so the coils were parallel, then did those last two steps again. Wick is a folded cut of Japanese cotton so each end rests in the well. I'll throw a video of it firing after lunch. Flavor production is out of this world."

I think that is due to a combination of the surface area and the coils themselves soaking up juice when I drip through the chuff top. Airflow is much more open since the coils sit in the middle of the deck, so draw is very easy. Clouds out real well. More than anything I'm looking forward to having a nickel build I can change the wick out on easily, lol"

Coilporn,3e12xl,karmapopsicle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:17 2015 UTC,"Thinner wire means better capillary action. I find the thinner the outer wire on claptons, the more coil-wicking is increased.

Don't know if you can see super well in this picture, but this is an example of what I find to be right in the sweet spot. You want the cotton to sit just on the deck so that it minimizes the amount of cotton but provides the maximum wicking. And like u/Polythesis stated, it also helps with the airflow. You may also see in the picture that my RDA can breathe because of the lack of cotton touching the underside of my coils. Hope this helps!"

Coilporn,3dwx8j,ikilledapanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:18:42 2015 UTC,It only took a few min to build. Fused Clapton's are easy to build when you have a kanger head to do it with. Labor and Vapor are on point.
Coilporn,3dwhjk,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:04 2015 UTC,very good. was always under the impression that ni200 coils should be spaced. maybe that's different for claptons? mine are always spaced.
Coilporn,3dwhjk,_occur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"ni200 contact coils work fine so long as you carefully pulse out the hotspots at low power. Very easy to do on the DNA since you can simply turn off temp protection and run it at 10-20w for pulsing.  The claptons actually make it even easier since the ni200 is so low resistance. Normally when the outer wire is a similar resistance to the core wires, you can get hot spots between the outer wires when pulsing. In the case of ni200 though the cores are so conductive I didn't have any trouble at all. In fact, this was probably the easiest fused clapton I've ever done."
Coilporn,3dwhjk,_occur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:17 2015 UTC,"appreciate the tip. one more, whats your experience between kanthal and n80?"

Coilporn,3dwhjk,gardvar,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:27 2015 UTC,Nope. The outer wire in claptons is basically just passive heat dissipation.
Coilporn,3dwhjk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"Cool, because the resistance is too high? What would happen if you switched them around?"
Coilporn,3dwhjk,CrustyBrainFlakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the resistance of the outer wire is so high it can be ignored.   Do you mean switched around as in the materials? (like 28ga n80 core with 40ga ni200) or the specific wires here being switched?"
Coilporn,3dwhjk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"yes, as in materials. Using nickel on the outside. I always have a bit of an issue with nickel being too low resistance, If it could be wrapped around or twisted with something low resistance you could probably bunch up a lot more coil in a smaller space to get a higher resistance."
Coilporn,3dwhjk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:53 2015 UTC,"ni200 on the outside won't work for temp sensing, since the main heating portion of the coil must be a resistance changing material. You can twist ni200 with kanthal, or use something like titanium wire to hit higher resistances, though it requires a device with customizeable TCR curves, or manually setting the temperature limit lower to make up for the different curve values."
Coilporn,3dwhjk,v3xx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:59 2015 UTC,Why would it not work? as long as the resistance of the nickel is lower than that of the kanthal I see no reason why it wouldn't essentially be the same thing as this.
Coilporn,3dwhjk,gardvar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:56 2015 UTC,Think about how much length of very thin wire is going into the outer wraps. The resistance of the ni200 will end up very high.
Coilporn,3dwt65,_occur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:42:21 2015 UTC,Testing ni200 claptons with all ni200 vs kanthal ni200 hybrids (ni200 core). Can't say I find a significant difference. Except the wire becomes even more fragile with all ni200. Clipped a lead on install. Will probably stick to ni200 cores and kanthal shells for temp control.

Coilporn,3dwp4j,_occur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:59:33 2015 UTC,Both ni200. Still trying to figure out this build.

Coilporn,3dshr3,Jesko_,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:10 2015 UTC,Of course glad to help. For that you basically get lets sayyyyyyy 24g wire clapton some 32g or anything smaller then decore the clapton wire from the 24g run some ribbon wire I used .3 ribbon inside of the clapton wire and then stretching it out. Now with that stretch out clapton wire wrap it around 2 strands of the 24 core or any core you used to make the clapton with personally I would do 26. But make sure when your clapton it over the 2 strand the drill is in the opposite direction of the original clapton. So if you did the original Clapton clockwise make sure you wrap over the 2 strands of wire counter clockwise. Hope that helps please feel free to ask me anything I really don't mind helping people I really want everyone to do amazing builds and expand there potential

Coilporn,3dsk69,broken_axe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:44:01 2015 UTC,Joules is watts essentially. Just some mods run joules some run watts.   It's important to make sure your in TC mode though when vaping nickel cause it can release some harmful shit of heated past a certain point.
Coilporn,3dsk69,mikerall,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"Ahh, so it's joules/second? And I do...made the mistake of bumping it out to vw mode once. Once was enough"
Coilporn,3dsk69,broken_axe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:14:38 2015 UTC,Joules is watts/second (could be wrong there) IIRC

Coilporn,3dsk69,GabrielGaetano,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:31:52 2015 UTC,"start wrapping a spaced coil, then pull it so it spaces out more and then compress it together against the handle of the screwdriver and it should space itself evenly when you let it go. i've come to like the springiness of nickel. took a few builds to get used to."

Coilporn,3dsk69,IKROWNI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:33:45 2015 UTC,"I've had the same experience. I'm not sure what the problem is. I've tried multiple temp builds on my velocity and all seem so meh. Everyone talks about the great flavor and I see people in videos blowing decent sized clouds too. But no matter how many times I've tried it's always been very low vapor output and flavor that was similar to a standard 24g kanthal wrap.   I think I might try again later. I've experimented with a single going between the 2 posts, dual coil, dual twisted, and dual clapton. The only one I ever got to work OK was the single 26/28 all nickel on the broke dark horse I have.  Im Using an ipv4 and have maxed the temp and joules on every build and still only get a small cloud and little flavor.

Coilporn,3dsjqo,daddyblackboots,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:25:34 2015 UTC,"Really? Which device are you using? It seems to work ok for me, but then again both my TC mods (Ipv3 Li and Evic VT) have titanium modes. Ive been running this build at 90-100 J and 500-550 degrees F, and a similar setup but single coil at 60w and 500-600 degrees F. Maybe you forgot to lock the resisitance before firing? I made the mistake of locking the resistance after a short puff once (it sensed that single coil build at .17 instead of .13) and even though ive been consistently vaping at 550 degrees, it gave me my first ever burnt hit off a TC mod.. Lol Other than that though, theyve been fantastic. Some serious vapor for TC, and the flavor is so good i havent touched any of my kanthal builds in a while... Haha"
Coilporn,3dsjqo,daddyblackboots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'm using an IPV LI and used two ti 26g cores wrapped with 32g ka. It' seemed really hot even when I brought it down to 400 degrees. I thought the titanium would still regulate the temp control since it has the lesser resistance but idk, the temp definitely seemed too hot. Could be I forgot to set the resistance since it was still pretty new to me at the time. I still forget sometimes actually, but that burnt taste reminds me pretty quick. I'll try it again when I get some more ti. I tried an all titanium clapton but I screwed it up and that was the last of my 26g ti wire, still have some 30g left."

Coilporn,3dotpw,thecb10,3,Sat Jul 18 01:06:29 2015 UTC,smaller wire gives a lot more crevices for the juice to work its way into so when it starts firing there's a lot more juice there to get vaped.
Coilporn,3dotpw,fucktthat,2,Sat Jul 18 01:19:32 2015 UTC,Ah yes. I believe the larger core with smaller wraps aids in the electricity flow/heating of the coils as well.

Coilporn,3dgqhd,0vlade0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:57:32 2015 UTC,I always spend like 20min trying to trap the wire in the posts. It always backs out! The post-holes are a bitch as well...
Coilporn,3dgqhd,kray67,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree.  If you build the coil right, the ends go into the holes like butter.  If you don't.. well then you didn't."
Coilporn,3dgqhd,phroztbyt3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:27 2015 UTC,How does the coil build determine how the posts grab onto the wire? Seems a little backwards to moi.
Coilporn,3dgqhd,t_ves57,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you bend the ends to fit the post holes easier.  Plus by using the postholes you aren't limited as much to the thickness of the kanthal (if youve ever built without postholes, you know that if you get too thick, it just doesn't hold right in the screws themselves.)"
Coilporn,3dgqhd,phroztbyt3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh so there are actually post holes on the Lemo? I had no clue but ya I own a Marquis, and I understand the struggle of post screws lol it's a bitch."

Coilporn,3ddnoa,crapsoda13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:40:56 2015 UTC,Thanks man!  I wish there were more good single coil rdas
Coilporn,3ddnoa,crapsoda13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:26 2015 UTC,Right? It seems like a lot of rdas lately have been just catering to dual coils. I mean at least put on some airflow controller that allows for single coil builds because to me a single coil is all I really need. Plus it allows me to make one good coil as apposed to maybe one good coil and then a coil that doesn't look anything like the first coil lol. If you ever watch twisted messes it always seems like his second looks jank af compared to his first one.
Coilporn,3ddnoa,crapsoda13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, plus, building a single coil on an rda made for duals,  really restricts your space. Where a two post rda has Better options for a single.  And you can still go dual on a two post design."
Coilporn,3ddnoa,toke4455,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:35:23 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the velocity? And yeah I know. Sometimes it's a bitch trying to fit some builds on my mutation x v3. Sometimes I'll get the build on there and then realize that if I don't position the airflow cap just the right way it'll short.

Coilporn,3dbcxe,I_need_a_backiotomy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"Oh it's amazing. I probably won't be using my RDAs for quite some time. I'm trying to think of comparisons, which is hard because it's all subjective.. This specific build, has better flavor than the Herakles, but requires half the wattage. Something I really appreciate because I prefer to run single battery mods that are limited to 50w. The airflow is awesome, you can totally immediately feel that it's more restricted than an RDA or some of the super high wattage tanks that have been out lately, but it doesn't affect the vape much. I've been able to run this at 60w without much of a problem. This specific coil has a sweet spot of 30-40 watts. Higher than 45 you risk a burn depending on your vaping habbits. I stick to 32 Watts on this and the vapor is pretty good, it's actually a lot more vapor than I expected, I'd prefer less. The flavor with this build is more or less equivalent to a fused clapton in an RDA. You might not like it, but it's perfect for your first try with the billow. Really easy to make, and easy to install, with very nice results. The tank can handle it dual, but I prefer the single coil. Make sure you block off the airflow as seen in the picture if you do a single coil, and make sure you block it off with enough cotton so that it's easy to remove.  You're going to love the Billow V2, I can't put it down.  EDIT: Make sure to wick well, less it more, especially with this tank. You want just enough to just dip it into the canals, but not fill them to the bottom. I cut my cotton and rayon just past the base/deck, only about 1mm hanging off of it. Wet it before pushing it down onto the deck/just into the canal.   EDIT 2: If you need any help with this build, I need to test the macro on my canon and could do a little walkthrough for you."

Coilporn,3dc3pf,IKROWNI,2,Wed Jul 15 02:50:10 2015 UTC,My velocity is occupied at the moment so I see my dark horse that a pin had popped out of. This is a very very tight fit and had to have lots of work done to get it all in there without touching anything. It's ohming at 0.091 ohms.   I have a dual twisted 24g sitting in my velocity that ohms at 0.2 and the cloud production is on par with it.   This is definitely my new favorite temp control build though. And it was very easy to work with.

Coilporn,3d80uv,eddie995863,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:39:38 2015 UTC,yeah I mean the loose wraps towards the right side of the coil kinda piss me off in an ocd way but believe me it in no way affects the way the coil heats up or makes contact so I'm not too worried about it.

Coilporn,3d80uv,thejollyroger9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:10 2015 UTC,Sorry bud your not the first. It's actually called xenowire when wrapped like this. Not armoured alien.
Coilporn,3d80uv,thejollyroger9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 2015 UTC,From what I've seen xenowire is not made the same way. If you look at my newer post it's very clear they aren't exactly the same. It looks like the xeno uses a single fused clapton at the core and almost a helix but not quite as the alien. Mine has two claptons at the core and just normal twisted 34g as the alien.

Coilporn,3d7t2a,thrwbak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:36:26 2015 UTC,Hey guys. So I made this wire a week ago and this is the second build I have done with it. The first one is in my Hobo and it did not perform as I wanted it too but I have found the Hobo to not be as flavorful as my other dripper I have. I put this one in my 454 because its the only other atty I have that has room for a Clapton LOL. Couple questions- Is it better to use Nichrome if so why? and I noticed I had some break in with this build here and it took awhile before the flavor started coming thru. It is better than my normal build which is a 26g twisted that I use all the time.  Thanks
Coilporn,3d7t2a,prettymatthew,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:10 2015 UTC,"Nichrome has a lower resistance/ft. Personal preference, but if you had used nichrome for this, it would've measured out lower than .7X...try some smaller gauge wire for the outer wire, maybe some 32 or 34. It'll add more juice channels & lower the ramp up time."

Stainless steel mesh uses capillary action to work against gravity in order to bring liquid to the coil. The mesh is rolled into a tube like shape and is inserted in place of cotton or sicilia.   If you're a flavor chaser and use anything else to wick but mesh, you're not doing it right :)"

Coilporn,3czo9w,crackizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"More surface area means more area in contact with juice, which means more vapor and truer flavor. Since this is a Clapton variation, ideally the outer wrap carries no current and has minimal impact on the resistance."

Coilporn,3cz7w7,jmd_akbar,2,Sun Jul 12 10:03:38 2015 UTC,Welcome to the sub:I used to different sized screw drivers of you can see in the pic the left coil is slightly smaller in diameter than the right. You don't have to do this but i didn't have the same size where I built this one. They were 3mm and 2.5mm. I did my normal wrap and then used the other screw driver in parallel together and came back around the 2.5mm screw driver and did that wrap. I was planning on doing a quad coil but I have a istick 50w and didn't want to go below. 2ohms. Hope this helps any other questions just ask. I will try and do another and take pics.
Coilporn,3czqcz,Sayt__McSpots,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:39:41 2015 UTC,ohms? looks very nice btw

I have only been building for 3 months but personally I find the progress awesome, from screwing up standard builds because I had forgotten to tighten my leads, to hand wrapping claptons, then THIS kind of thing being just a 'bored experiment.'  Always feel inspired to push myself further and try to build better."
Coilporn,3cz428,jayembee67,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"I have to ask, can you use this build on a mod with temp control? Or does the kanthal ruin it for that purpose?"
Coilporn,3cz428,Redeemd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:37:25 2015 UTC,"So yes, this works 'just fine' with the VT40's temp control.  You can set the TC and firing will cut off when it reaches that temp, and hover pretty well and seemingly consistently.  No dry hits either.  What I think the Kanthal does is throw the TC of by some %, so I think I am running at a lower temp than would be 'expected'.  Or something like that...  Anyhow, it appears to work with TC, for me at least, and is way easier to work with than pure Ni200; much more rigid coil, no leg slicing and you can reach 0.1 or 0.2 without having to make a coil an inch wide."
Coilporn,3cz428,br3or,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:14:20 2015 UTC,See I made the same build last night and my snow wolf wouldn't register the temp control so I trashed it.
Coilporn,3cz428,420-THC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"Strange.  I have these Ni200 wrapped Kanthal Claptons in three of my devices and TC works for all of them : http://imgur.com/Tjv0jcl  I did find that using 28 awg Kanthal core made the TC on the VT40 hard to use (I had to run it at 200F which was as low as it goes) but with higher resistance 30 awg core it seems quite happy.  And the eVic was very fussy to begin with and would 'fall back' to wattage mode all the time.  But once I really cranked down all the connections, it stabilised and has been working just fine ever since."

Coilporn,3cog39,Gokjo_Krorl,2,Thu Jul 9 19:18:33 2015 UTC,That's crazy! How do you do it? I usually replace my coils once or sometimes even twice a week.
Coilporn,3cog39,Totesmcgotes77,3,Thu Jul 9 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"correct me if I'm wrong, OP, but I believe it's because clapton coils have such low heat flux. basically, the coils/wicks aren't being ""stressed"" by the amount of power flowing through it since the higher gauge wire acts as a heat sink."
Coilporn,3cog39,Gokjo_Krorl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"So it's actually advantageous to mix thin and thicker wire? Or is that what a ""Clapton"" is? Sorry, I'm 100% new to building, I haven't had a chance yet.  Some of the stuff I've seen on here is absolutely wondrous. :D"
Coilporn,3cog39,Totesmcgotes77,3,Fri Jul 10 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"Clapton is higher gauge wire wrapped around lower gauge wire.  The higher gauge wire has high resistance and therefore barely heats up while the core wire (lower gauge) wire is the wire doing the actual vaporizing.  That higher gauge wire on the outside acts as a heat sink and cools the vapor, while still keeping the density of the core wire.  Flavor and vapor are usually better on claptons than a standard coil."
Coilporn,3cog39,Gokjo_Krorl,2,Fri Jul 10 16:25:52 2015 UTC,Oh! That's a pretty clear explanation to me. Thanks! Makes me wanna skip the whole single-coil stage and jump into Claptons but ya gotta start somewhere.
Coilporn,3cog39,backwoodsanarchy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents...I'd get proficient at wrapping standard coils first, that way, when you do a clapton, you know it will be set up really well.  Learning how to clapton can be a bit tough but once you get into a groove it's easy.  :)"

Coilporn,3cqopp,EatMyPoopiePies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:05:12 2015 UTC,"drill out the post hole, dont clappton with 28"
Coilporn,3cqopp,notalexweyls,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:28:25 2015 UTC,may I ask why?
Coilporn,3cqopp,non-polarbear,3,Fri Jul 10 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"The reason is that it goes against the idea behind the clapton. A clapton coil is meant to be wrapped with a significantly smaller gauge than the core. This causes the electricity to flow through the core and only a negligible amount of energy flowing through the wrapping. This is due to the fact that electricity is ""lazy"" and takes the path of least resistance. The purpose of the outer wire is to soak up juice, allowing better juice/coil interaction. (Didn't have a better way to say that) your coil is going to be pretty high in resistance, most likely, and wont perform as well as a coil made with, say 24/32 or something of the like."
Coilporn,3cqopp,notalexweyls,0,Fri Jul 10 03:43:42 2015 UTC,well said /u/non-polarbear also Overall amount of wire effects ramp up. While the 28g around the 28g has an irrelevant resistance because it's so high (It reads the core wire) but because the 28 gauge is so thick (relative to 32 and higher) it hinders ramp up because of the amount of wire.
Coilporn,3cqopp,darkhorsefkn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:03:29 2015 UTC,Also try vertical coils in the derringer.    Trust me.  I'm a random stranger on the internet.  Would I lie?  verts give less spitback and more flavor.   Also what old mate said about the different wire sizes.  Using the same gauge like this is sub optimal.
Coilporn,3crjx9,Longdog91,2,Fri Jul 10 05:03:25 2015 UTC,How much did your set up run you? And what kind is it ? I got a k-100 and I'm looking to upgrade

Coilporn,3cp17y,diltay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"Its great, it does everything i need, however it IS a replacement after 3 weeks of service. I cannot fault it other that that, great battery life, compact, temp control, great design, feels well built and overall solid. However i feel pretty nervous with it as it lasted 3 weeks and conked out on me when i was dry firing a dual coil and cant help but think its going to crap out on me again. I don't have much faith in joyetech anymore as i was under the impression they are a fairly quality brand - perhaps i just got a dud, although i did think it was worth mentioning. From a price point it's a no brainer, you won't be disappointed honestly, great little device that puts out and keeps on putting out :)  Edit: I know my reply might sound a little conflicting and it is, it's just i just wanted to add that this device hasn't really been out that long for it to be classed as one of those ""solid"" devices that's going to perform without fail 90-100% of the time. Like i said for the money it's really worth a shot and if you are looking for a mod with internal battery (main reason i bought it) then go for it, i know the sigelei 150w is one of those ""solid dependable devices"" and has some great feedback so i plan on getting one as a backup/daily driver so if it fits what you are looking for go for it buddy."

Coilporn,3cmrx8,DryBranch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:33:22 2015 UTC,To get that slanted look and fill in all the gaps you have to space the binding wire by like 3 or 4 twists.  Let's say you space the first binding wire by 3 twists.  You then go back through with 3 more wires to fill in those twists.  So in total you will have 4 binding wires.

Coilporn,3cncu5,mas3fect,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:37:54 2015 UTC,Just had to see how .06 vaped. I've had a bunch of different builds and I am loving this one. It's cloudy as can be.

Coilporn,3ck987,crapsoda13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"how far are you stretching it? i think that's my problem is that i'm overstretching the coil and it doesn't want to wrap itself all nicely.  idk what i'm doing wrong but have stopped for the time being due to using all my wire on hand, doh"
Coilporn,3ck987,xmpx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:04:37 2015 UTC,Well you want to make sure you don't overstretch it to the point where the wire loses those spirals. Once those spirals are gone the wire is unusable. I like to stretch it to just a little under that point so that way you still get the alien look but it's easier to actually wrap it than if the loops were closer together. Just as long as those spirals look like they could still have a core in them then you'll be good.

Try building it on your mod next time. Just lock the fire button or turn it off.   When you are tightening your leads down, leave the screwdriver through your coil.

Coilporn,3ca3et,Evoandroidevo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:07:12 2015 UTC,Perhaps my previous wording was confusing but if the staging were nickel it would bypass my coil and be under the load limit.

Coilporn,3c8k36,GMU_TheHulk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:12:09 2015 UTC,i have the coils higher up leveled with the top of the posts. flavor is improved a bit. next build i'll push them higher up.  if i had 27g i could get more wraps in and take advantage of the velocity's wide deck bc the two posts. but the 28g worked out spaced it as wide as i could.
Coilporn,3c8k36,GMU_TheHulk,0,Mon Jul 6 00:49:05 2015 UTC,Is this a clone? Build looks mighty fine!
Coilporn,3c8dyp,Venom1223,3,Sun Jul 5 21:28:52 2015 UTC,How'd you make them all curvy?
Coilporn,3c8dyp,TechnoL33T,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:38:29 2015 UTC,Clapton clockwise or counter it dont matter. Remove the core wire out. Stretch the outer clapton to where you cant stretch it no more but not to much because you still need to have the shape. Clapton like normal but whatever you did first clockvise or counter you have to do the opposite and if the wire goes over you cant fix it. It will screw it up and thats pretty much it
Coilporn,3c8dyp,chops51991,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:06:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit out of the loop on things good coil related.  All I've made are standard, twisted, and Clapton.  What's exactly is alien?  What does it improve compared to regular Claptons?"

My guess would be because an outer wrap with curves would have more surface area than a straight wire, thus absorbing more juice and producing better vape.   Happy?"

Coilporn,3c807e,Zamibe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:29:07 2015 UTC,Its hard to tell in the pictures but I always make sure to put a little distance between the coil and the cotton at the bottom so there is a pocket for the air to go underneath the coil.
Coilporn,3c807e,Zamibe,2,Mon Jul 6 09:37:35 2015 UTC,"I noticed that but it also wicks better without it under the coil. If you're happy and getting a good Vape thsn fine, this is just my 2 cents."
Coilporn,3c807e,Zamibe,2,Mon Jul 6 15:49:59 2015 UTC,Well with the builds I do the coils themselves like to wick the juice to a certain extent. So the juice in the drip well has no problem making it to my coil.

Coilporn,3ca0ob,Longdog91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:18:07 2015 UTC,This is 24 based and then there is some 28 on top in the seams and then you twist it one more time. So just a couple extra steps.

Coilporn,3bzx0s,Fipilele,6,Fri Jul 3 14:43:34 2015 UTC,"Do you have a power drill? If so, its   SO  much easier to just clapton the wire directly. Use like 24 or 26 awg as the core, and spin the drill with the 30 in the chuck and wrap in around the wire. Takes a bit of learning, but super simple once you get it."
Coilporn,3bzx0s,TankBlaster24,2,Fri Jul 3 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"A better drill is going to be on order soon. I have one, well its a power screwdriver(!) but it goes at one speed (fast) and I have to jam a hex key in with the wire to hold it in. The drill I have doesn't have the three or four clamps at the chuck. I'll look at getting a variable speed one soon and then practice some more :)"

Coilporn,3bzx0s,tilardi223,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, wrapping it straight on to the 28 first is the way to go and the shorting out was my first, so I'll probably lose some more on the way :P"
Coilporn,3bzx0s,NATEMCWN,3,Fri Jul 3 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"Easy way to prevent shorting out is to out the top cap on and spin it around, if you hear grinding, push the coil closer to the posts and away from the sides"

Coilporn,3bzx0s,NATEMCWN,3,Fri Jul 3 14:45:11 2015 UTC,unfortunately its bound to be sloppy with this style. with claptons the outter wires arnt actually conducting much and its the core wires quick ramp up that is heating that outer layer. so it doesn't quite work to coil then insert the core wire since you wont have that direct contact for heat transfer

Probably not the best method but if you find that you're leaking more than you'd like: Grab a spare o-ring, cut a small section of it, get a tiny drop of crazy glue on it and then jam it into the neg post air hole. Wait a bit before you vape it, so all the crazy glue is dried up.  A couple more gotchas:   The center post get's pushed up really easily. Try not to tighten it too hard on your mod (unless you have a spring connection pin, like the sig150W) The post holes are little small for thick wire but you can safely drill them out if you clamp it down in a table vice grip.   Otherwise a really great RDA, awesome flavor and nice cloud production."

Coilporn,3bqd4d,tylerlawhon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:23:11 2015 UTC,Using nickel on a non-tc device?
Coilporn,3bqd4d,hardkorg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"Nah it's ""TC"" just doesn't work perfectly like most other tc's lol. It's regulated so regardless still safe to run in wattage mode, the 2nd hit is just always different (much more of a real Vape) I find than from the first. I just love the taste and ease of nickel."
Coilporn,3bqd4d,AsherMaximum,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:43 2015 UTC,how do people wick these spaced coils without bending them.
Coilporn,3bqd4d,djnifos,2,Wed Jul 1 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"I take my cotton pad and cut out a decent strip. Twist it HARD so it's basically solid feeling. Then I spin it as I begin to push it thru the coil. As long as your spinning the same direction as you wrapped the coils in, it shouldn't change their shape much, if at all. A few adjustments after with a tiny flathead, and your set."
Coilporn,3bqd4d,djnifos,2,Wed Jul 1 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"Very, very carefully. I use my tweezers to hold it in place; put one tip at the last wrap and one at the first.  I recently switched to rayon though, and that is much easier, since you have to use less. It also works really well with TC."
Coilporn,3bqd4d,djnifos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:29:14 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to try wrapping on a bolt.  The TPI on the ones with the proper OD is prohibitive in my eyes.  (Threads per inch; outer diameter)
Coilporn,3bqd4d,AsherMaximum,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:32:13 2015 UTC,I tried this a few times. I couldn't get the fucking wire off without unwrapping my coil. Like it was literally impossible with ni200. Maybe if it was annealed....
Coilporn,3bqd4d,toke4455,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:10:17 2015 UTC,Even unscrewing the bolt out of the coil didn't work?
Coilporn,3bqd4d,djnifos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:29:21 2015 UTC,Oh god no that's what destroyed the coil. Nickel is so soft it just wouldn't let go of the bolt without unraveling. May have wrapped it a little tight but still... Should be easier than that
Coilporn,3bqd4d,ferretboy87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:11:29 2015 UTC,I guess I don't need to try that then.  What about two strand parallel and then unscrewing one?
Coilporn,3bqd4d,ferretboy87,2,Wed Jul 1 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"I use a screw for wrapping, and have had no issues removing it."
Coilporn,3bqd4d,madmike1186,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"I tried one time, found I was better at just wrapping nickel spaced by hand cuz I couldn't get the 2nd strand to unravel easily lol. But try it and lemme know how you get it to work!"
Coilporn,3bu0pt,darknight_fiat_695,3,Thu Jul 2 03:37:16 2015 UTC,I think your cotton fell out of your coil
Coilporn,3bu0pt,Longdog91,0,Thu Jul 2 03:50:03 2015 UTC,No room in super nano could for cotton. Make a nice fluffy bed of cotton under the coils and puff away! Not big on clouds but flavor is on point!

Coilporn,3bpk3r,gabeisanerd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:13:11 2015 UTC,Why nickel instead of kanthal?
Coilporn,3bpk3r,zombehsoule,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's quite simple. Kanthal's resistance basically doesn't change as it heats up, while nickel's does, quite dramatically at that, too. The chip in your mod can read that resistance change and calculate the temp based off of that, and then start pulsing power/sending less power to the coil."
Coilporn,3bpk3r,gabeisanerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"I love it. The flavor has been better, I don't need to clean coils as much, cotton lasts longer. No complaints at all!"
Coilporn,3bpk3r,Muisek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:39:31 2015 UTC,Do you notice a flavor difference worth putting in the second coil as opposed to just running single on the TC with nickel?
Coilporn,3bpk3r,Muisek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"There's more flavor, to me at least."

Coilporn,3bpk3r,Children_suck,2,Thu Jul 2 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"Keep the screw in until the coil is completely ready. It's even better if you get 2 identical screw, that way nothing gets bent when tightening that pesky center post (assuming 3 post RDA)"

Coilporn,3bhlp3,causeicancan,2,Mon Jun 29 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"I have both, and I definitely have to give an edge to the velocity here. I have the v4, a velocity clone, and an authentic velocity. Even when I just had the velocity clone I couldn't stop using it. I will say, though, that the fused claptons def help with flavor."

Coilporn,3bgz09,WhyaintweatDorsia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:26:23 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what the benefit is to making these extremely difficult and intricate coils. I get lots of flavor from either my dual parallel 22ga or my 20ga quad (parallel is better, I feel). Does the smaller wire bring out fruit notes while the thicker, hotter wire gives you a hot richer vape? Because I have learned that smaller wire and lower wattages bring out more tart, fruitier flavors while large wire/high wattage allows the darker, creamy and nutty rich flavors to come out. I'm just curious as to what the actual benefits are."

Coilporn,3bglrv,crapsoda13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:22:20 2015 UTC,That looks like a hell of a spitback. How does it vape?
Coilporn,3bglrv,SiliconGolem,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:14:09 2015 UTC,The vape isn't too dense but It is a pretty warm and very very flavorful vape. When i first started building I loved the flavor that twisted coils gave then when i went on to do claptons I love the flavor that that gave even more. So I just combined the two and honestly I like the taste more than a normal clapton or a twisted build.
Coilporn,3bfie3,theycallmerood,3,Sun Jun 28 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"Nothing fancy??? I remember when I first subscribed to this sub: parallel and twisted wires were fancy and claptons were the kings of coils. Now it seems every post is some variation of alien wire, and claptons are sub par. I can't even imagine what coils will be considered ""fancy"" when people say their threaded-staggered-flatwire-fused-clapton-alien-stovetop-coils are ""nothing fancy.""   Anyway, lovely build, and very fancy! You should be proud! I bet it tastes and rips just as well as the next alien wire to get posted."
Coilporn,3bfie3,22x4,2,Sun Jun 28 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"That is a very good and spot on observation. I used to think that my twisted coils we're the so cool... I really got into claptons when they began to get popular, I typically run a fused Clapton but tried out a triple core this time around. Looking back from where I started to now it is a huge leap forward and quite fancy. Thanks for the props!"

Coilporn,3bfie3,Jobe422,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"It's pretty quick! Since it's basically  a parallel with a shell it has a fast ramp, good flavor, great clouds."

Coilporn,3bbqli,LOGIC_alien,2,Sat Jun 27 19:35:34 2015 UTC,I've never made one of these before. It looks like a variation of a fused clapton where the outer wire was your 2 pieces of 36g Ni80 twisted with your ribbon wire (loosely?) before wrapping around your 2 core wires. Is that correct?
