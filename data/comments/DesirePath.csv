DesirePath,3ddpt8,paidgun,26,Wed Jul 15 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"So this one brings up another issue: What fraction of people are taking the straight path? The paved path doesn't show traffic wear.  This picture looks like it could be a hot day and the paved path goes through the shade while the desirepath goes through the dust and stones. Also, the longer path has the strategically placed trash can. I might actually prefer the longer way here. Maybe it's just kids going home from school on bikes that take the straight.  In fact, the ""straight"" path does in fact curve away from that fenced in area a little. That's consistent with a bike theory--you have to keep far enough away to prevent your handlebar from fouling. People on foot wouldn't need to stay that far from the fence and might actually be more likely to be close so they could run their fingers along the links."
DesirePath,3ddpt8,xbtdev,3,Wed Jul 15 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and the fact that there are two parallel paths that overlap shows that it probably gets a decent amount of traffic, when bikers have to stay left and right to go around each other."

DesirePath,3d9dv7,sosorrynoname,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:13 2015 UTC,Romans built basically cobble stone roads. So if you were riding in a cart you would be thrown up and down continually. So cart drivers put their wheels in the dirt beside the road for a smoother ride. Because this caused a huge ditch to form Romans put large intermittent cobblestones beside the road like speed bumps that would throw the carts in the air as a disincentive not to put all the cart wheels beside the road.

I'd bet you that the sidewalk off the circle that's in the satellite image but not in the map image was once a desire path."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,ParagonStorm,2,Tue Jul 14 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"it would be faster to walk across the lawn to the intersection then to go left or right for it.   I must not be understanding what you mean, because what it sounds like is crazy.   I see there are tables set up along the sidewalks in that Google Earth view.  That might just be a temp thing, but if they do it often enough that'd change the ""fitness landscape"" a lot. Maybe that nexus point would be the only reasonable way to get back on the sidewalks all weekend, for instance. Or this is Winconsin, so maybe they set up snow fences on in some places in that wide flat area like I remember from Iowa.  It could also be a walking together thing. Like, people come out of the building on the left and walk to that nexus together, then split up. Depending on the departments (for instance, math and physics) it could be significant pressure."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,InadequateUsername,2,Tue Jul 14 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"It could be for bikes, especially since it looks so narrow. It would be worth a slight detour to go on a paved road, but probably not all the way around the plaza."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,Furthea,2,Mon Jul 13 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"Desire path psychology! People dislike walking on mud, but people like walking directly. They're after a direct route to the top-left corner of this image, and the nexus provides a good balance of muddy shoes and time-saving."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,WatchOutRadioactiveM,33,Tue Jul 14 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"What a shame. Looks like really nice grass, too."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,helium_farts,43,Mon Jul 13 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"They could just turn it into a real path.  Maybe line it with trees or something so it looks nice.  I mean they're already making you pay absurd tuition, the least they could do is make a nice path."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,WatchOutRadioactiveM,4,Mon Jul 13 17:55:15 2015 UTC,Aye and they could even add in a mirror-angle to the path so that the overhead view retains it's neat geometric-ish look according to the google maps overview another poster posted.
DesirePath,3d4jhz,SheeEttin,-11,Tue Jul 14 01:27:55 2015 UTC,I mean they're already making you pay absurd tuition   How do you know the tuition of this university when the name is not mentioned?
DesirePath,3d4jhz,Joucifer,22,Mon Jul 13 18:47:59 2015 UTC,Based on the flags it looks to be The University of Wyoming.  According to their own estimates you're looking at $20k-$30k/yr to attend.  I suppose whether that's considered too much or not depends on the person.
DesirePath,3d4jhz,SaxMan366,-8,Mon Jul 13 19:30:34 2015 UTC,You're good! Can you find out why the flags are half-mast?
DesirePath,3d4jhz,SheeEttin,17,Mon Jul 13 22:03:41 2015 UTC,I'm guessing someone died.
DesirePath,3d4jhz,Flash64,5,Mon Jul 13 23:13:31 2015 UTC,The sidewalks for Prexy's were laid out from a picture taken during winter showing the paths students had taken thru the snow.
DesirePath,3d4jhz,Bandin03,10,Mon Jul 13 21:45:10 2015 UTC,"Woah, I guess I'm not the only one on reddit who goes to the university of Wyoming. Prexy's was the fort place I thought of when I discovered this sub but you beat me to it."
DesirePath,3d4jhz,LsDmT,3,Mon Jul 13 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"Huh, it is named Prexy's. Sounds more like a name for a bar.  Also, I see a Merica Hall nearby? What's the deal with that?"
DesirePath,3d4jhz,Bandin03,5,Mon Jul 13 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"Don't remember where I read this but one school built its campus with no sidewalks. After a few months or so, the walkways were put in according to the natural paths the students were making to get to classes. Kind of a no brainer."
