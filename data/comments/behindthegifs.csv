behindthegifs,3e33y3,cup-o-farts,42,Tue Jul 21 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"I imagine if you wear all cotton, eye protection, and a face mask, it's probably pretty safe.  Helps to keep a fire extinguisher nearby too.  Edit: I'm wrong about cotton.   Cotton is more combustible than polyester. It ignites easily and burns rapidly, leaving behind a light ash residue. Polyester resists ignition but once ignited, it melts and causes severe localized burns. The fire hazard is also high with cotton/polyester blends due to the high rate of burning and fabric melting. The safest route is to purchase clothes that are treated with fire retardant materials.   It's just a matter of how you like to get burned.  Source"
behindthegifs,3e33y3,ch00f,27,Tue Jul 21 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"wear all cotton   No, please dont do that when shooting each other with fireworks"
behindthegifs,3e33y3,Weeberz,24,Tue Jul 21 17:48:17 2015 UTC,"No, do wear cotton. The reason you wear cotton when dealing with fire is if your clothing catches on fire, it burns. If you wear something like polyester, it will melt onto your skin while still burning.  The only way that your clothes would actually catch fire is if you get one of the shots trapped in your clothes and don't remove it quickly.  Source: A bunch of my friends do fire poi."
behindthegifs,3e33y3,derekiv,15,Tue Jul 21 18:14:45 2015 UTC,why would they not just wear wool
behindthegifs,3e33y3,Weeberz,11,Tue Jul 21 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"You could probably wear wool as well. The reason people doing fire poi wear cotton is because it is normally already pretty warm out when performing, so you don't want even hotter clothing."
behindthegifs,3e33y3,derekiv,3,Tue Jul 21 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"but wool is cooler than cotton. it wicks away moisture way better than cotton, and isnt uncomfortable when wet. also it doesnt really burn as when it chars it insulates itself. it doesnt melt. i cant think of a single thing cotton is better at. might be cheaper  source: eagle scout and very active camper"

behindthegifs,3e33y3,TommiHPunkt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, cotton as opposed to synthetics.  Polyester melts to your skin while cotton is a moderate flame retardant.  Obviously you should wear one of these if you have access."

CollegeHumor's policy prior to my arrival was to just send takedown notices. I'm on a crusade to prove that we can get tangible traffic from these sites by pre-emptively posting content before it's stolen, instead of just being at war with them.   Basically, I'm trying to solve the oldest problem on the internet. ""Does well"" usually means a whole lotta pageviews on the native site.   edit: mighta been over-stepping sharing exact numbers"

You know what got me to open a link outside reddit or imgur tho? That extra panel you made. Seriously. I wanted to see it. I HAD to see it. I went to CollegeHumor for that, and it was worth it.  I believe that's the solution you're looking for. Leave an exclusive panel on CH, like an ""outtake"" or an alternate ending. Or, if you're evil, end the comic on a cliffhanger, and leave the ending on CH. We'll go where the content is, just make it enticing."

behindthegifs,3bezdn,Takuya-san,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:47:39 2015 UTC,Depends on the state.
behindthegifs,3bezdn,ferthur,4,Mon Jun 29 00:09:55 2015 UTC,I live in a railroad town in the US.  They have them at major crossings but not at less traveled ones even inside the city.
behindthegifs,3bezdn,Takuya-san,6,Mon Jun 29 06:06:37 2015 UTC,"The truck was trying to stop. It's an icy road. He probably hit the brakes about 5-10 seconds before the gif even started, based on the way he was already driving quite slowly.  He might have been better off swerving off the road, but he probably misestimated that he'd stop before the tracks.  Edit: At the end of the day it's still partially the truck driver's fault since he was likely driving pretty fast to begin with. Should slow just a little when you're approaching a crossing on an icy road just incase a situation like this happens."
behindthegifs,3bezdn,ferthur,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:20:44 2015 UTC,"No partially about it, driver is 100% at fault. No excuses. Flashing lights were active and the driver failed to stop.  I do however, feel bad for everyone involved, for something that could have been easily avoided by slowing down sooner. I really hope the driver was able to get out before the second train hit."
behindthegifs,3bezdn,Lampjaw,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:48:28 2015 UTC,Depends on how long ago the flashing lights activated. It takes a long time for a heavy vehicle to stop on an icy road if it's travelling at speed.
behindthegifs,3bezdn,venice_mcgangbang,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"Except it still doesn't matter. Our job as professional drivers is to be aware of potential hazards farther down the road, and to react accordingly. As soon as they saw the crossing, they should have been slowing down, especially if they know the lights only come on a few seconds before the train arrives. IIRC, in the US it's a minimum of 20 seconds between the lights starting to flash and the train reaching the crossing.  Edit: fixed a word."

Hoverzoom modifies ""certain Amazon links"" on all websites you visit, adding its own affiliate ID. The extension sends the browsing habits that it collects to a third party website (webovernet.com and jsl.blankbase.com) It sends domain misspellings to another third party website (advisormedia.cz). All monetization schemes are active by default. On December 17, version 4.27 was released which submits what you type into web forms to a third party website (qp.rhlp.co) On December 18, version 4.28 was released that removed the script again that was added on December 17.

To combat this, Victoria's secret service tries to combat this severe blow of degradation by terminating her reign (mind you, not necessarily killing her). If it succeeds we'll get to know.  The fact that Agent Abraham looks like Abraham Lincoln is purely coincidental..."

At such a prestigious event as the Golden Swastika awards, it was expected for the Führer to make a speech on the events to come later in the show, but a performance was unusual; and so when the Führer made a sudden move forwards, as if he had taken a swift blow the back, the crowd was drowned out in a heavy fog of panic, but soon the Führer looked up with a fury in his eyes. This rage was yet unseen by his officers, and they hastily glanced to one another with eyes begging to find the one who disturbed the show. But something rang across the crowd that would never be forgotten until the last breath escaped their lungs; Hitler cocked back his legs and arched his sides in a style yet to be witnessed by the Germanic peoples. Führer gazed upon the crowd and twiddled forth these words from the darkest regions of his mustache, ""Ladies, Gentleman, Arians, we will not win the cause by such simple means as camps and war, no, no, no, my little schnitzelings. We need something they have not yet experienced. The Blitzkrieg is no longer working. It is time to call the Twayne 'The Hard Place' Thompson, It is time for the Fast & Führerious."""

behindthegifs,36q2he,GenericOblong,27,Fri May 22 10:42:56 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure I benefited a lot from being able to explore and learn without interference (and I actively parented my kids that way), I could have done with more supervision than I had. I did some very dangerous things as a child and teenager. I'm honestly lucky I made it through childhood alive and physically unharmed.  Just a couple of examples. When I was nine, my sister seven, and my brother four, my mom left one Friday and didn't come back until Tuesday. I'm not sure where she went. It was the first time, but wouldn't be the last, that she'd just take off for a bit. Ostensibly, the downstairs neighbors were watching us. Realistically, we were alone. We stayed in our own apartment and I don't recall anyone ever checking on us. I remember trying to make biscuits in an oven that didn't work and just kind of hoping they'd turn into biscuits if I let the dough sit out long enough (spoiler: they do not). After we tried the ""biscuits"" and found them inedible, we ended up eating marshmallow creme as our only source of food because that and the biscuit dough were literally all that was left in the house.   When I was fourteen and my sister twelve, my mom got pulled over & ended up going to jail for passing bad checks (outstanding warrant) and never once mentioned that she had two kids at home (my brother was living with his dad by then). For over thirty days, while she served her sentence, we just took care of ourselves and this was a totally normal thing for us. My sister was expelled from school at the time, so I just stayed home to take care of her until the school started leaving warning messages that they would be taking my mom to court over my truancy. Then I went to school. At night we would party with our neighbor. Alcohol, pot, games of truth or dare, quality activities.   I'm not saying I needed a helicopter parent. I don't think anyone needs that kind of constant meddling and control. I probably could have used a parent who would occasionally stop me from doing stupid, dangerous things though."
behindthegifs,36q2he,Moneygrowsontrees,8,Thu May 21 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well shit, I'm sorry. My early life was a disaster too (spoiler: As soon as I reached age to leave I moved to a whole 'nother country to escape it). I didn't say we had it good, I just said we were lucky to have been able to play with bugs and dirt. In the same sense that helicopter'd children are lucky to be cared about - doesn't mean their life is great. It's just looking at the bright side."

I can be rather pessimistic in general and I'm told my constant need to discuss things to death is annoying as hell.  I do agree that I gained a lot in my extreme freedom. I matured early. I learned how to handle unexpected situations. I learned how to cook, clean, treat wounds, pull teeth, read, write, do small household repairs, all sorts of things way earlier than my peers. I'm not easily intimidated or frightened.  If I were the flash and could go back and change my childhood, I don't think I would. Not because it was overall positive, because it wasn't, but because I like who I am today and I'm pretty certain I wouldn't be this person if I hadn't been molded by all of my childhood experiences."

This one time we were at my grandparents' when they lived on a farm and they (parents and grandparents) watched me pick fights with the geese and touch the electric fence. It was all done in the name of ""He'll learn not to do it again if we let him"".

That bigfoot character appears and chases them and they climb into the sunroof of the car before bigfoot gets to them and he starts raiding their stuff. At night a can of soup falls onto the car so Goofy tries to grab it and dramatically just in time gets it before bigfoot slams into the car. He falls back onto the stuff outside and the headphones fall onto his head then he starts dancing to staying alive like this!

behindthegifs,337q49,Marzhall,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"It Came from the Nightosphere (from Adventuretime wikia):       The episode begins with Marceline and Finn hanging out at her house inside the cave. She asks Finn to help her lay down a sweet track, but to remain non-judgmental as to the extremely personal nature of the song. Finn agrees, but upon hearing the song, a mournful tale of parental estrangement and french fry theft, Finn asks Marceline why she does not reconcile with her father, as the song suggests is her desire. Marceline explains that not only do they have longstanding difficulties in the father/daughter department, but also that he is trapped in a fiery dimension known as the Nightosphere. The only way to free him is to draw a happy face, douse it with bug milk, and chant a fel incantation in Latin.

If I remember rightly, it's because of the genetic background of Jews being very similar, as it's a religion that's spread across the world because of Jews moving around the world, rather than widespread conversion such as happened with Christianity and Islam for example. Sikhs are too I think.   So bearing that in mind, yes."

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, it could be noted that the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

A woman came in just then while out walking her dog, and saw the thief trying to get away, but when he saw the dog he dropped the money and ran.

behindthegifs,3285i1,GoWaitInDaTruck,28,Sat Apr 11 18:39:28 2015 UTC,The beaver had to change the way he cooks to appease the reviewer. He doesn't care about the review because its not about the food he actually cooks. By compromising his morals he also loses his passion.
behindthegifs,3285i1,neongreen3395,12,Sat Apr 11 21:59:21 2015 UTC,Yes but what does the gif have to do with that?
behindthegifs,3285i1,Cheesemacher,2,Sun Apr 12 11:12:49 2015 UTC,Not much. It could have been a gif of any animal eating random food.
behindthegifs,3285i1,ladycarp,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:47:19 2015 UTC,The otter is the food critic.
behindthegifs,3285i1,rockafella7,11,Sun Apr 12 12:52:42 2015 UTC,Is this a reference to the movie Chef?

behindthegifs,3285i1,ladycarp,9,Sat Apr 11 21:40:30 2015 UTC,"Man I like the art but I have no idea what the story is - why does the beaver change his mind about preparing food specially for the guest, does the guest like it, and why doesn't he care? Also is this a house of cards reference?"
behindthegifs,3285i1,robotjackie,2,Sat Apr 11 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"The chef doesn't want to sacrifice his integrity and vision of his food for the food critic,  the otter. He doesn't care about the otter's good review because he sacrificed his artistic integrity for it, so it feels cheap and not earned on his own terms. Selling out, if you will."

behindthegifs,3273j1,Indigoh,70,Sat Apr 11 03:58:35 2015 UTC,opinion:  I hate this type of behindthegif. You can do it to almost literally every gif. Some guys slips in a puddle? His mother was a champion at slipping in puddles. A car wreck? The car did it for its dead mother. Lightning struck a tree? Did it for its dead mother.  The new perspective it adds to the gif is just nothing.
behindthegifs,3273j1,mattlohkamp,10,Sat Apr 11 08:31:01 2015 UTC,"It's backwards - the story dictates the gif, rather than the gif dictating the story. This gif doesn't need a story: they're at a paper plane competition, sponsored by frys, and this dude probably did really well. There's nothing to be explained, no story behind the gif.  This isn't a sub for gif-assisted stories, or at least that's not the intention - it's for explaining otherwise curious gifs. It's basically like when someone posts a gif as a reaction, and someone else replies with ""context?"" - the story is the (fictional) context, in art form."
behindthegifs,3273j1,IIcolour_Spectrum,23,Sat Apr 11 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"yeah no i have to agree. the only relevance the background story has to the gif is that it's a paper plane and it's flying far. This same post but without the ""feels"" parts of the background story probably wouldn't have gotten as much attention."

behindthegifs,3273j1,Indigoh,-2,Sat Apr 11 18:28:42 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be difficult. That's the point I was trying to make. I mean I gave 3 examples of ones that would be as good. Didn't take me more than 30 seconds.
behindthegifs,3273j1,IIcolour_Spectrum,13,Sat Apr 11 08:43:57 2015 UTC,It took me longer than 30 seconds to draw these. Thank you for the feedback.
behindthegifs,3273j1,jesset77,3,Sat Apr 11 13:32:37 2015 UTC,"That was supposed to be a criticism of the story, not your art. Your art is nice and clean, its just the story was somewhat cliché and mostly irrelevant to the gif.   Their point was that they like btg's that are a story to explain a gif, instead of a gif to conclude a story.  Personally I have to agree, the best btg's are when the story makes a good gif so much better than it already was."
behindthegifs,3273j1,SecretWalrus,13,Sun Apr 12 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like this post doesn't align well with sub goals because the backstory doesn't tie into the gif in any way other than ""here is a sad story about a paper airplane, now here is a gif that also features a paper airplane"".  Should we make up a meandering backstory for a bicycle and then show a clip from the end of the tour de france?  Now if, instead, the gif had involved the paper airplane either chasing somebody with a bow or unexpectedly landing in their hair, that would have really involved other elements from the backstory thus justified it better."
behindthegifs,3273j1,oobidoobanoobi,10,Sat Apr 11 13:13:31 2015 UTC,"This is just dumb, this is not what /r/behindthegifs was ever supposed to be like. I wish we could find the very first gif that was ever uploaded. It was a picture of a trash can saying ""Hitler did nothing wrong!"" then the gif of about 20 people beating the shit out of a trash can.   You see the picture explained why people were beating the shit of a trash can. This doesn't explain anything, it's a paper plane that flew a little funny ... ha...ha.

There was a comment thread talking about that, but I could see it looking really cool if, in the second frame, you had the text in the lower third in a different, more angular sans serif font. No line pointing to the speaking character, because you've drawn the scene well enough that that is clear.   Just a suggestion. But all in all, I think this is a very creative take.

The way I'm practicing is to simply trace over existing things, then attempt to create my own original spin. For clarification, I use a graphics tablet to draw on my PC.   This is the one I use. It's pretty damn cheap for what it does, and has pretty good pressure sensitivity."

I think I could make some decent progress if I got started though, I can almost always tell why my drawings are bad.  Poor perspective, anatomy, shading, etc."

I use flash but it's pretty expensive, a good place to get started is with the software ""toon boom animate 3 PLE"" you can download a free to use version on their website. this is the software used to make many animations like rick and morty, futurama, princess and the frog, it was used as a tool in the lego movie and so on.   the first thing I did to really learn motion was drawing bouncing balls, because it's very easy and quick to draw and once you get how the frames have to be composed to make a smooth animation you will begin to understand the concept of motion better.  Here's a nice video that helps with a lot in understanding motion as well by disney animators. https://vimeo.com/93206523  Of course if you stress to much on making it perfect it will never be done in time for getting something on reddit."

Either way though, your knees are going to be bloody.  Also, you don't need to use Photoshop, just go with whatever you're most comfortable with. I personally prefer Krita which is open source and more focused on drawing.  I'm not a professional artist (or even a particularly good one), but I am an indie game developer (programmer) so what I know about drawing I've learned out of sheer necessity. My preferred method of digital drawing is on my Surface Pro because beyond having a full digitizer, it also has a 1080p display. It's meant to be a laptop replacement rather than a drawing tablet though, so if you just want a tablet for drawing with a screen, I'm sure you can find hundreds of cheaper alternatives.  Drawing technique though I can't really help you with other than that line about riding a bike. Also, if you want to draw a face, start with a ball and a plus in the direction you want it to look, like this thing.  .... good luck"

behindthegifs,30c8gv,beaglemaster,82,Thu Mar 26 05:09:07 2015 UTC,It confused the hell out of me too. I came here looking for an explanation.
behindthegifs,30c8gv,BigSwedenMan,20,Thu Mar 26 06:07:10 2015 UTC,"I guess he's saying the boss is really intimidating/difficult, so the game is ""cheating"" to beat him."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,ThatsSciencetastic,37,Thu Mar 26 18:45:30 2015 UTC,the characters are game characters so they are talking from the point of view of the monster creature.   So the user(player) is really hard so just cheat to beat him.   The gif show the creature using a two handed smash with a sword and then it auto grabbed as a glitch/cheat.
behindthegifs,30c8gv,squeak6666yw,3,Thu Mar 26 19:38:32 2015 UTC,"99% certain the Cleric Beast is not weilding a sword, it is a giant grotesque beast with long ass claws. Also if this thing cheats I don't know what the boss I'm stuck at is doing lmao."

behindthegifs,30c8gv,GunNNife,29,Thu Mar 26 11:40:13 2015 UTC,It makes sense (kinda) if you watched Reboot. Matrix (big baddie) is complaining that the user (crossbowman) is tough. So he cheats by reaching to grab him outta nowhere.
behindthegifs,30c8gv,Freeside1,13,Thu Mar 26 13:54:59 2015 UTC,Awwwwwwww shit that totally makes sense. The problem here is everyone is thinking of Matrix as crossbowman and not big baddie

behindthegifs,30c8gv,thinkpadius,214,Thu Mar 26 07:38:18 2015 UTC,"This is the first *real* boss in the game Dark Souls, which is notorious for incredibly difficult bosses. IIRC The guy playing had never played the game before, and his mates bet him that the couldn't kill this boss on the first try (knowing full well that he'd get his ass handed to him).   You can see them walk out of the room in disbelief, as this guy lucks out with a one in a million chance: the boss jumped back and fell off the bridge. This isn't how you normally kill this boss, but any strategy that works is allowed and encouraged in this game, so it counts as a legit win.  I tried finding the link but came up short, its on youtube though."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,Merlord,70,Thu Mar 26 07:48:11 2015 UTC,"Its Kootra from the Creatures, playing DS."

I know as a player who came close to throwing my controller at the screen while playing DS numerous times understand the pain of the people who walked out.   ""Are you fucking kidding me?

behindthegifs,30c8gv,HORSEtheGAME,3,Thu Mar 26 19:48:04 2015 UTC,I don't wanna sound elitist or anything but did people really have problems with that boss? I remember beating that boss just by running back and climbing up a tower to do a falling attack. Maybe I'm thinking of a different boss but that's how I remember it turning out. I didn't even get past Anor Londo though so it's not like I'm a good player. I should really try that game again it's been so long...
behindthegifs,30c8gv,FastyMcNasty,20,Thu Mar 26 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"That's the boss but you have to have a much greater comfortability with the game and it's mechanics to just instantly realize, oh yeah, that'll do the trick. Once you figure it out it's a no brainer, but when he pummels your face the first couple times you're more worried about how to attack him without being obliterated."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,molsonbeagle,10,Thu Mar 26 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"This game makes you feel like such an idiot. I got destroyed half a dozen times by Taurus before I remembered the falling attack... You know, that one move I just learned from the boss on the tutorial level."

It wasn't until I got pelted by that sniper up there that I saw and climbed the ladder. Then I sat that like a dummy throwing firebombs at him until he jumped up like the fucking Hulk and gave me another beatdown. So yeah, you could say I had some problems with him.   But I got pretty good at the game, the only bosses after him to give me trouble were the Capra Demon, the Gaping Dragon, Ornstein and Smough, Ceaseless Discharge, the Centipede Demon, Sif, Seath, the Moonlight Butterfly, Manus, Artorias, Nito, and I couldn't really figure out that Bed of Chaos shit for awhile.

I hear a lot of people call games hard that aren't actually difficult, but because they're used to really easy walkthrough style games.

Tough, because you will die a lot. and that's okay, because once you learn how to the play the game by the rules it functions by...suddenly that which seemed impossible is within your grasp. You will die over and over again in the beginning as you learn how the world works... But once you do,you find it Fair in it's approach, and when you can anticipate and work around the challenges it presents, the difficulty fades to the background and you're able to enjoy the theme and ambiance of the world.  Is it hard? Yes. But it's a worthwhile experience as well."

It compares pretty well with blood borne, although it alters a lot of systems. In essence it's still the same though.

behindthegifs,30c8gv,AmaroqOkami,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"If you're seriously interested, you could look up some gameplay footage or walkthroughs on youtube.  Currently the ""series"" of souls games are the following: Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Blood Borne.  I myself am not too familiar with Monster Hunter, but the main idea is to hunt all these monsters in a systematic way if I'm not mistaken and take on quests right?  Well in a souls game, you get dropped in a unfamiliar world, and the first couple of enemies will absolutely mess you up. And you'll think it's unfair.  The thing is, it's not. After a couple of tries you'll get to know your moveset, you'll get to see their moveset and learn from it if you are persistent.  Sure, sometimes the game messes with you and it seems like a random act of bullshit, but most of the time it's learning to read an enemy and learn from your past mistakes.  In my opinion, I liked DS2 the most. I have no experience with Demon Souls though. The reason is that DS2 was just a better port for the PC than DS1 was. However, as a story and the execution, Dark Souls 1 was way better and both Demon Souls and Blood Borne are said to be way better than Dark Souls 2.  So to awnser your question, not really like monster hunter, except maybe the boss fights. (DS2 has a lot of knight bosses though)"

Monster Hunter is like what you described, though they start off in a way showing you that Monsters do in fact have ways of reading them, that one behavior leads to another. But it punishes you really hard for fucking up, especially late-game."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,AmaroqOkami,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"Souls games keep on punishing you, and enemies change throught the game so you're constantly adjusting.  On top of that, souls games are pretty eerie. Not scary, eerie. In my opinion (and that of my friends), souls games are all worth picking up.  The only complaint I've heard with Blood Borne so far is the loading times are just way too long, but they're supposedly bringing out a patch for that.  I'm just hoping the rumours of a PC port are true :)"
behindthegifs,30c8gv,Eitje3,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Would love a PC port.  But yeah, if you like Souls games gameplay a lot, then from what you describe, you'd like Monster Hunter. It's literally a bunch of exceptionally challenging boss-fights, where each monster you have to learn their movesets, behaviors, habits, weak-points, etc. to beat them. Otherwise you'll just die."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,AmaroqOkami,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:58:29 2015 UTC,Too bad the only monster hunter games on PC where MMO's and it's not yet released or beta outside of Asia (I think).
behindthegifs,30c8gv,Enicidemi,2,Fri Mar 27 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"I very, very highly doubt it is the hardest game ever made. Is it hard? Probably, but there's likely many games that trump it in difficulty.  It's probably just people who've never played a hard game before."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,AmaroqOkami,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"Hardest game ever made, and marketed as such, is IWTBTG (I want to be the guy). It's a grueling platformer that's 99% bullshit and 1% ""still bullshit, but I shoulda seen it coming""."
behindthegifs,30c8gv,Enicidemi,0,Thu Mar 26 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"Well of course they'd market is as the ""hardest game ever,"" because that generates sales, but I highly doubt that the Souls series, out of the tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of games made, it's the hardest ever.  I'd say that Bullet Hell games are likely a good harder that Souls. Like this: https://youtu.be/utGmwWVq-ck?t=104"
behindthegifs,30c8gv,AmaroqOkami,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:56:32 2015 UTC,"Souls was never marketed as the hardest game ever. It's difficult, and has earned the moniker due to it's popularity, primarily. Out of the most popular games of the past 10 years, it definitely could be near the top of the list.

The one that white shirt grabbed didn't try to fight him off or turn on him like many people would. He ducked and ran, while scanning for danger.     This is proper procedure for the grabbed guy to do, cause if someone is grabbing you and pushing you there is probably a reason.

Their captains are old friends and start bragging to each other.  ""My crew has the bravest men,"" says the first one. ""Just watch. YOU THERE! JUMP IN THE WATER! THAT IS AN ORDER!""  The man he pointed at promptly jumps at the water and is attacked by sharks, but manages to get out missing only one leg.  ""See that? That is bravery!""  The second captain scoffs; ""That is nothing, my crew has the bravest men. YOU THERE! JUMP IN THE WATER AND SWIM AROUND THE SHIP! THAT IS AN ORDER!""  The man he pointed at promptly does so and is mauled by sharks. He struggles, but finally manages to swim across the ship, and is rescued. He loses one arm and one leg in the process.  ""See that? THAT is true bravery!""  The third captain laughs. ""That was nothing. Watch this."" he points at a scrawny looking man from his crew. ""YOU THERE! JUMP IN THE WATER! THAT IS AN ORDER!""  The man takes one look at the sharks, then back at his Captain.  ""Fuck that, sir, there's sharks in there.""  The Captain beams at his friends.  ""See? THIS is TRUE bravery!"""

There are a plethora of dangerous things besides the zombie virus, such as triffids, fungal towers, netherspawn/spacecreatures, mutants. Lots of stuff.  Crafting system is really deep and the game has an extremely steep learning curve.  You learn fast or you die fast, but usually both.

As you can see, Rooney (the guy in the gif) was in a boxing match in his own kitchen with a good friend and ex-teammate of his. Rooney was knocked out and nearly smashed his head on a table-leg, which could have been a serious injury. Naturally, it caused a media shitstorm because the media loves to start a shitstorm over anything involving Rooney.   So the story goes viral, and Rooney celebrates a goal by making light of his situation and poking fun at his boxing inadequacy."

behindthegifs,2yqr4f,bartonar,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"That's incredibly unusual.   The question was ""So in your country, the husband takes the name of his wife ?"" - to which I replied that, yes, it isn't that unusual in other countries. My husband took my name and as far as I know sadly I'm not from a royal family. Among my aquaintances, the different solutions - husband's name, wife's name, hyphenated, everybody keeps their name - are equally common."

While I would love to make my living with my writing one day, for now I'm content to offer things for free.

Replacing meaningful content that could be distracting with placeholder text may allow viewers to focus on graphic aspects such as font, typography, and page layout. It also reduces the need for the designer to come up with meaningful text, as they can instead use hastily generated lorem ipsum text.  The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.  A variation of the ordinary lorem ipsum text has been used in typesetting since the 1960s or earlier, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. It was introduced to the Information Age in the mid-1980s by Aldus Corporation, which employed it in graphics and word processing templates for its desktop publishing program, PageMaker, for the Apple Macintosh.

The system itself doesn't have any inherent property that makes it easier to use.  You can pretend Imperial does because it's defining lengths are based off more directly available objects but those associations can easily be made with the metric system too.  The best example is typically in North American designs a door handle is approx. 1 metre from the ground.  Also, anything that is 1 foot long is also approx. 30 centimetres long (ie. 1 ruler long).  It's easy to find some length on your finger that is 1 or 2 centimetres long as well."

behindthegifs,2x0e88,EvanMacIan,5,Wed Feb 25 11:41:29 2015 UTC,"What makes imperial useful isn't that it's easier to guess, it's that it has more measurements meant for common situations. Like 90% of the time I'm measuring something it's because I'm cooking. Teaspoons are useful, tablespoons are useful, cups are useful. Converting everything into milliliters doesn't make things easier. The fact that a cubic centimeter is 1x10-6 cubic meters is in no way useful to me, no matter how useful it may be to a chemical engineer (and I suspect it's not all that more useful to them, considering how little math is done by hand these days)."

It does make a big difference for professionals like scientists and engineers.  Computers do a lot of heavy lifting in certain processes but a lot of work still involves people doing calculations where they handle inputs directly, which is easier in metric.   Also my main point is that the idea of a teaspoon representing a meaning of volume is just a learned habit.  Remembering it as 5 mL or 1 tsp doesn't really change anything, it just matters which you're better at because of habit and whether or not we all use the same system so we understand each other.  If anything the metric system simplifies things by only having a single volume unit instead of gallons, pints, etc.  Like don't get me started on how a gallon in England was different than in America, or on dry/wet measurements and how confusing those are."

And yes, 1 tsp is easier to remember than 5mL, just like 1 and a half cups is easier to remember than 375 mL. Lower numbers are easier to remember.

Beagle 2 is named after HMS Beagle.  The spacecraft was successfully deployed from the Mars Express on 19 December 2003 and was scheduled to land on the surface of Mars on 25 December; however, no contact was received at the expected time of landing on Mars, with the ESA declaring the mission lost in February 2004, after numerous attempts to contact the spacecraft were made.  The spacecraft's fate remained a mystery until it was announced in January 2015 that Beagle 2 had been located intact on the surface of Mars in a series of images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE instrument.   The images suggest that two of the spacecraft's four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the spacecraft's communications antenna. Beagle 2 is the first British and first European probe to achieve a soft landing on Mars.

behindthegifs,2ww0is,StezzerLolz,13,Mon Feb 23 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"Blowing from a gun:       Blowing from a gun is a method of execution in which the victim is typically tied to the mouth of a cannon and the cannon is fired. George Carter Stent describes the process as follows:   The prisoner is generally tied to a gun with the upper part of the small of his back resting against the muzzle. When the gun is fired, his head is seen to go straight up into the air some forty or fifty feet; the arms fly off right and left, high up in the air, and fall at, perhaps, a hundred yards distance; the legs drop to the ground beneath the muzzle of the gun; and the body is literally blown away altogether, not a vestige being seen.  Blowing from a gun was a reported means of execution as long ago as the 16th century, by the Mughal Empire, and was used until the 20th century. The method was utilized by Portuguese colonialists in the 16th and 17th centuries, from as early as 1509 across their empire from Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka)  to Mozambique  to Brazil.  The Mughals used the method throughout the 17th century and into the 18th, particularly against rebels.   Arguably, the nation most well known to have implemented this type of execution was the British Empire, in its role as paramount power in India, and in particular as a punishment for native soldiers found guilty of mutiny  or desertion.  Using the methods previously practised by the Mughals, the British began implementing blowing from guns in the latter half of the 18th century,  with the most intense period of use being during 1857 sepoy mutiny, when both the British and the rebelling sepoys used it frequently.   The practice is said to have been still in use in Afghanistan in 1930.

I assume that the caffeine is stored in the actual coffee, and not in the cream and milk and sugar and sweetener and chocolate and tutti frutti and god knows what people put in their ""coffee"" nowadays? If so it would only make sense that when you fill 3/4 of a cup with not-coffee, that would make it less caffeinated than a cup filled with only coffee.

behindthegifs,2wfki5,forsalebypwner,5,Fri Feb 20 07:26:08 2015 UTC,"Cat taping is also fun just make sure to only use masking tape so it doesn't pull their fur.  The reasoning I have heard was their skin is very sensitive and it basically sends a message to their brain saying there is a solid object there even though it is only a piece of tape. when they move their skin also moves a lot taping or tying things to them makes theme not be able to move like normal.  The cat will quickly learn to ignore the sensation and be able to walk normally after a few min, in the same way you don't see your noes when you are staring at all day, but it really messes with them until then.  And no it doesn't hurt the cat it might stress them out though if you see the cat panting or really freaking out stop it quickly. Usually though cats are use to people doing weird shit and will just be slightly annoyed."

Now, this isn't a zoo or some animal preserve, it was a pig farm in rural  Mid-west - he bought them from an exotic animal show.  One day one of them got loose and was running around the flat prairie and cornfields.  A neighbor called to report where it had stopped and helped my uncle catch him.  Only issue is that the small trailer they used to take animals to shows and had used to bring the emus home was being borrowed by another of my uncles and wasn't going to be back for weeks - the neighbor had no where to store her and he had to get the creature out.  My uncle had literally no choice but to shove this emu into the back of his Chevy Blazer.  She was a gentle creature with him for the most part, but something about the confines of the SUV drove her crazy.  On the drive back home he had to hold her by the neck because she kept kicking forward at him and pecking at his head.  By the time they got home she was wheezing.  They brought out the vet, but there was nothing they could do, she was already in a coma.  She died from a swollen neck that prevented her from breathing.  The other one lived a few more years until they sold her.  But she always had this evil glint in her eye like ""I know what you diddddd..."""

I went to the zoo with my family earlier this week, and there's a place kind of off to the side of the elephant enclosure you can get really close if one is in that area. The big female came over to us, she seemed really interested in my kids, waving back at them and stuff like that. She kept trying to reach across the divide at the edge of the exhibit, and when she couldn't she started picking up clumps of dirt and flinging them at us. Every single one landed on someone's head. I was just impressed, I can't even aim that well. She was pretty close, but still."

behindthegifs,2vdkae,AdamG3691,23,Tue Feb 10 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"not sure if serious, but for anyone who doesn't know, the kicking is to set it off balance, the robot is designed to be able to lose its balance and then regain it and continue on (unlike other robots that would just fall over). it's for things like uneven or low traction terrain, for example, a rescue robot that can ""trip"" if it hits a rock but not fall over would be a godsend to doing stuff like carting people off a mountain.  so James is actually helping the robot by training it for unexpected falls, and also instilling a healthy loathing towards humans to better prepare for the robot apocalypse (where, thanks to the training given by James, kicking will be useless)."

It's not causing confusion over emergencies like lights, but still, it gives the wealthier an advantage over the rest of us with 1h+ commutes."
behindthegifs,2v6s6f,faunablues,5,Mon Feb 9 03:31:51 2015 UTC,That's pretty shitty since tax money paid for that road in the first place.
behindthegifs,2v6s6f,HorizontalBrick,2,Mon Feb 9 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know; tolls and extra taxes, etc on certain industries and/or road users would likely also contribute. I expect that the thought process behind being able to pay to use the extra lanes is to gain additional funding for road infrastructure; not only does it indicate demand for better roads, but it also specifically saps money from those who can pay.  If those roads aren't used much and are only ever exclusively for paying drivers (ie they aren't only pay-to-use during peak traffic or whatever), then they might be a drain on the tax payer. Otherwise though, I only see it as a somewhat novel method for getting funding for better roads."
behindthegifs,2v6s6f,humanmanguy,1 point,Mon Feb 9 11:29:44 2015 UTC,"I get the logic behind it, absolutely. For me though, I think it's a bad idea just on principle (the wealthier literally get ahead), the real way to address the problem (in this context) is facilitating use of public transportation, and also that there are just so many cars on the road that the pay-to-use lane could be an additional open lane. At the most extreme, if you don't have the extra $2 or whatnot per commute, it could mean being in traffic for 2 hours versus 30 minutes.   In some other cities, the carpool lane is also used for taxis, buses, etc - so public transport becomes faster and more desirable. It would be better to improve our crappy transit system to encourage use. There just isn't enough space anymore for everyone to have a car."

A siren is the noise they make, not the vehicle itself, nor the lights.

behindthegifs,2v23p4,Omegamanthethird,-6,Sat Feb 7 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"I want to say something before this whole thing gets out of control. In 1967, in the hot desert sun, a woman gave birth to a boy in the back of old pick up. She was a whore. She left the boy at a local church. The father at the church didn't like children, but he knew that being a disciple of the bible he couldn't possibly not take the small kid. Instead he ended up taking out his frustration on the boy. At the age of three, the boy was forced to use the toilet. Let me tell you the little fell into his own pile of poop more than once. By the age of 5, the boy the boy was reading the bible and chopping wood for the fire. Despite the father's harsh character, the boy loved him and thought of him as his true father. By the age of seven the father raped him three times. The boy ran away. He survived four days in the desert by eating cactus and scorpions. He was finally found by a drug cartel boss, who took the boy in. Mr. Sanchez was his name, and he was immediately impressed by the boys intelligence and grown up attitude. Mr. Sanchez provided the boy with an education at a private prep school and a nice house. The boy had sex for the first time when he was 12, the next year he graduated high school. He was the school's star running back. The boy was lost, although he liked Mr. Sanchez, he never thought of him as his father. The boy went to India, were he became a spiritual leader of a large tribe of farmers. With his power he turned the several plots that each tribe member had into a large corporate farm and became a millionaire. His assets grew as he bought into other successful start ups. He often got ahead in business with his great leadership abilities, but once in a while he used violence. This was India after all. By the time he was 22, the boy had all the money he would ever need. So he bought a yacht and traveled the world for 10 years. For 10 years he visited every major port, slept with girls from every country imaginable, and tried every drug ever made (by nature and by man). When he was 33, he was walking on a beach in French Guiana when he met a girl of Irish - Native American decent. She bared his seed. It was boy, perfect health. He moved them to Argentina, then London, and eventually Vermont. The man was 45 now, he has seen everything, accomplished everything, tried everything. He skied down the Swiss Alps, been at the North Pole, swam with hammerheads, everything! Yet he has never done one simple thing that we all take for granted every day, he met his father. He never played catch with his father, he never talked about women with his father. He never would. He died at the age of 63 when his parachute didn?t open when he was base jumping from Dagger Mountain in Washington, USA. Over three thousand people attended his funeral.  I know what you are thinking. How does this story relate to me? Well I want you to go all the way back to the beginning of the story and remember the woman who gave birth to this incredible boy. You are like this woman. You are like this women because you are a whore."

Apparently the people in the shark outfits only had a few days to practice.   It just seems like a more realistic explanation.

behindthegifs,2unaho,skruluce,4,Wed Feb 4 00:03:12 2015 UTC,"The short answer is I don't know.   The long answer is, if I genuinely believed there was enough interest, I'd actually want to make it a miniseries. Something like 8 episodes, half an hour each. I'd talk to people in the industry to get an idea of costs and recruit talent for the potential project, and then I'd launch a Kickstarter campaign to cover the production, probably with a media company like Breadpig to handle rewards and whatnot. I always sort of wrote it while imagining it as TV-budget animation.   (Source: It's not like I don't think about it.)"

Y'know, like making some fucking potato salad. But no you're right, some of it is probably awful. But making an animated TV show would cost a lot of money, I think, and I'd have to be prepared to commit months of my life to making that happen, which would mean I'd need to be able to rely on the likely financial success of my venture.   In short, papa noob gotta eat, but his passion projects will become reality when he got some mo' resources to work with. I'm climbin' dat cartoonin' ladder, yo."

I feel like I'm the only one getting tired of the trend behind these noobtheloser type posts - yeah, they're all goofy and silly and whatever but they're just not clever at all. I feel like the reason people think they're funny is the comic rather than a clever twist on a gif. Posts like this are great - they're only long enough to get the joke across. Noobtheloser stuff just feels like a comic with a supplementary gif"

behindthegifs,2unb9m,FunnyMan3595,5,Wed Feb 11 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"I liked your animations a lot! A critique (given to encourage not to put you down) would be that the connection between the gif and the comic was not strong enough. I think the big thing is that none of the mime characters you introduced us to actually appeared in the gif.   I'm just spitballing here for an example: Maybe if you'd shown a mime as part of the attacking group (Willem Dafoe) as a former friend who'd betrayed them and was now attacking? Maybe convey the betrayal through thought bubbles since they can't speak?  Again, I really liked the art style and hope you submit again!You may even be able to submit a tweaked version of this one! I really need to make some time to contribute some content to this community since it's given me a lot of laughs, and I applaud you for doing it!  edit: I also went back and looked at some of your other submissions, and they're golden. Huge fan of Possession. Keep up the good work!"
behindthegifs,2unb9m,FunnyMan3595,18,Tue Feb 3 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts, but I don't really agree. Explaining the joke earlier would just make it weaker, in my opinion. I've also noticed that btgs tend towards what noob does with the texts and strange conversations before the point, and I felt like it would be more interesting to do something different.   Still, I try to mix up my comedic pacing, so whenever I do another one hopefully you will enjoy it more."
behindthegifs,2unb9m,andrewrgross,6,Tue Feb 3 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"I somewhat agree with /u/HomicidalHeffalump, but you're right that a full explanation would kill the joke.  What you need is to make it clear that the bullet that hits is very different from the ones that bounce off.  Art might be able to do it, but you could also restructure things slightly, assuming I recall the movie correctly.  Replace the drawn image of guns firing with a slightly earlier clip from the scene, showing the two characters actually firing guns, but stopping before we see the third (with finger guns).  That way, we're introduced to the clip earlier, so we're already familiar with it at the start of what you used.  It makes it clear that the first two characters (with real guns) aren't actually accomplishing anything, then shows a mime dying, making the reader wonder why.  Cut back to the GIF you ended with, and the reason is provided."
behindthegifs,2unb9m,HomicidalHeffalump,2,Wed Feb 4 01:18:14 2015 UTC,Why would replacing a sideways image of people firing guns be less effective than a frontal image of people firing guns?
behindthegifs,2unb9m,HomicidalHeffalump,3,Wed Feb 4 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"Because the problem is in the transition between art and GIF.  It's not immediately clear what corresponds to what, so the reader is left confused, trying to draw the connection themselves.  It's not a hard connection to figure out, but it does take a couple seconds, and blunts the joke.  By tying the GIF in sooner, the audience already understands how things fit together, so they can immediately appreciate the joke when they see it.  That keeps the punchline sharp.  You could get a similar effect by using the same view angle as the GIF has, but since the intent is to evoke the GIF, you'll get an even better result by using it directly.  If it helps, think of it like a fight scene in a modern movie.  If you keep cutting to different camera angles (as so many directors love to do), the audience loses track of who's where, and the fight becomes a jumbled mess.  By using a smaller number of consistent angles, the roles become more clear, and the audience understands the fight better."
behindthegifs,2unb9m,Admiral_Cuntfart,2,Wed Feb 4 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I see where you're coming from, I suppose. I think a harder joke is better than a joke that is too easy, however. I didn't want to directly evoke it, otherwise the connective leap is less fun to draw.  I also find it easier to follow the scene by keeping with that rule where you keep two sides facing each other for clarity.   It would be weird to have the gunman facing front on and the clowns facing sideways. I could have made the clowns also front on, but it begins to stretch the visual effect. Plus, it's hard to draw bullets deflecting from the front, and honestly I didn't try very hard on this."
behindthegifs,2unb9m,andrewrgross,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:08:55 2015 UTC,"I prefer it the way it is.  Because the gif pans right, the reveal was obvious and very funny to me.  We already see that bullets don't penetrate the ""walls"", before one does, so we know that something unusual happened.  Then we see Dafoe with the finger guns and it clicks hard."

behindthegifs,2ulmo4,innitgrand,12,Tue Feb 3 09:44:28 2015 UTC,Octopodes is correct too.
behindthegifs,2ulmo4,mrthbrd,8,Tue Feb 3 09:47:29 2015 UTC,"Actually octopi is more correct than octopodes. It shouldn't be, but it is. The most correct one is octopuses:  Sources differ on which plurals are acceptable: Fowler's Modern English Usageasserts that “the only acceptable plural in English is octopuses”, while Merriam-Websterand other dictionaries accept octopi as a plural form. The Oxford English Dictionary listsoctopuses, octopi, and octopodes (the order reflecting decreasing frequency of use), stating that the last form is rare.  Source:  http://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/octopus#English"
behindthegifs,2ulmo4,innitgrand,17,Tue Feb 3 10:16:05 2015 UTC,Octopi is more commonly used than octopodes. Not more correct.
behindthegifs,2ulmo4,kushxmaster,3,Tue Feb 3 11:27:16 2015 UTC,Yes but language is pretty variable. What is correct is defined by our dictionaries and the use of it. It's true that octopi makes no sense and should be plain wrong but the fact that it's in the dictionaries means that it's OK to use. Octopodes should be correct but is used less and consequently is in less dictionaries. I would say that if you say octopodes is correct then you have to allow octopi as well because of the dictionary thing.   I guess what it boils down to is what you use to measure correctness: the dictionary or etymology.

I might be explaining it wrong and frankly it only makes a little bit of sense to me.  Describing it as mining is frankly easier.    Anyhow, mining gets more difficult the more coins that exist, so getting in on the ground floor like I did means I was able to mine a huge amount of coins when they were still worthless.

behindthegifs,2sxf7s,Citizen_Kong,15,Mon Jan 19 15:49:16 2015 UTC,I never got why their names were so close.
behindthegifs,2sxf7s,theodrixx,35,Mon Jan 19 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Sauron -- Quenya (an Elven language) for ""the Abhorred""  Saruman -- Mannish (language of Men) for ""Man of Skill""  Maybe the names were made similar on purpose, but as you say, it's hard to think of a good reason why. And remember that the languages used in the books were constructed by Tolkien (who was a professor of language), and they all have their own writing systems and grammar and such just like organic languages. Plus, both characters were referred to by different names by different groups of people at different points during their lives (for example, Sauron was called Mairon, or ""the Admirable"", before his turn to evil). So I think it's just a coincidence, like the kind that would happen in real life. You wouldn't ask why the president of country A and the president of country B happened to have similar names."
behindthegifs,2sxf7s,Citizen_Kong,7,Mon Jan 19 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, Saruman is Old English/Mannish for ""man of skill"". His name in Quenya was Curumo (which means ""the cunning one""). You're right about Sauron though."

Since Tolkien ""translated"" the original Westron text into English, ancient Westron names are also translated into Old English (another example is Mariadoc Brandybuck, whose Westron name is actually Kalimac Brandagamba).

If it's talking about the physical crown, that has a somewhat interesting history. Apparently when King Otto was overthrown, he stole the crown and took it with him when he fled Greece. inn 1862, yet nearly 100 years later, the duke of Bavaria returned it to Greece, where it now is. As for who actually keeps the crown, that I can find nothing about."

It's supposed to be over-the-top, but at the same time it's supposed to be an outlet for genuine frustration with fat people.    Sweeping generalizations about the nature of fat people are just some of the products of the navel-gazing in that subreddit, and it does not involve a lot of sympathy or understanding."

behindthegifs,2sx1d7,failtolaunch28,7,Mon Jan 19 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"When people philosophize on the nature and ways of the fatties. Although you hear a lot of sound science about calorie intake and stuff, it's less about eating habits and more about fat acceptance, and fat people desperately trying to feel good about the way they look.  One post there was from a post on /r/gonewildcurvy, saying ""Girl, you're not curvy, you're morbidly obese"", which somehow got 5 upvotes in a sub that abhors and quickly deletes comments like that."

They recently creamed themselves when they realized they got this post to the front page. It says 'You fatties are gross and unhealthy no matter how you look at it.' And judging by the comments, they seem to think they're actually doing something beneficial based on their excitement over 'how many fatties they are reaching'."

Fat people are actually valued less, and thought of as less intelligent/competent in literally every way even though there is no demonstrable difference in performance (outside of obvious careers dealing with heavy physical labor) between fat/skinny folks.

The story has often been anthologized, and has been published more than once as a short book in its own right. The story was adapted as an animated short in 1965 and as a live-action feature film in the Soviet Union in 1975. The same year, animator Chuck Jones adapted the story for an animated TV special in the United States.

Hearing that the kid was probably being bullied over the gif going viral crushed me, and I feel awful for making light of that gif now. I never want to make a kids day even worse with a stupid comic, and I'm sure it hasn't been easy on him with the gif going viral. I deleted the imgur album and the images, but I know people seem to repost my art elsewhere (like on tumblr), but since I don't post anywhere but reddit I can't delete those versions of my comic myself : (   I don't care about stupid pixels on a screen when someone's life or emotions are being impacted. That poor kid is already going through a lot. I guess I didn't really think through what the true story could have been, and my insensitivity added to the avalanche of that gif blowing up unfortunately.  I do think I'll stick to making gifs-comics of animals only now, since animals won't be bullied by a gif going viral.   This is a long shot, but if anyone know the kid, I'd love to make him a card or something to help him, like if he has a favorite animal or something, I don't know.. Anyways, I don't know if anyone will come here looking for this, but if you do, that's why it's gone.

The crown was used in the coronation of the King of the Romans, the title assumed by the Emperor-elect immediately after his election. It was made in the late 10th or early 11th century. Unlike many other crowns, it has an octagonal rather than a circular shape, and is constructed from eight hinged plates. The plate in the front of the crown is surmounted by a cross, with a single arch linking it to a plate at the rear of the crown. The crown is now exhibited at the Hofburg in Vienna.

In the meeting, Ford and his brother Doug, a council member, mocked critics, with Councillor Ford calling them “scumbags.” In the midst of some “angry exchanges,” Rob Ford then rushed council member Pam McConnell, who regained composure and attempted to calm Ford down.  According to the Globe and Mail, Councillor Ford was heard challenging another member after the altercation, saying, “You are a disgrace. Bring it on, buddy. Get the real taxpayers down here.”  On Fox News on Sunday, the mayor apologized for his erratic behavior and announced that he is “seeking professional help,” though he denies that he has an addiction problem. Ford also announced aspirations to run for prime minister of Canada.  The Ford brothers will debut in “Ford Nation,” a political talk show-turned-reality TV show on the Sun News Network at 8 Monday night.   http://www.salon.com/2013/11/18/mayor_rob_ford_tackles_council_woman/"

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

Probably not the ones who have read it already, but my main point is that reddit has lots of users and therefore there's a good chance that a lot of people haven't seen it and don't get the reference, or even haven't heard of Unidan and the drama that goes with it.  Even if only 1% of reddit hasn't seen something, it's still a huge amount of people. Also there's so much content that goes by so fast overall that it's really easy to just ""miss"" something   tl;dr: complaining about reposts doesn't take in consideration the people who don't spend their lives on this website (like myself)"

behindthegifs,2robqk,BasedCereal,2,Thu Jan 8 11:39:43 2015 UTC,So I take the ecstasy and I make good pun like you yes?
behindthegifs,2robqk,itsnotgoingtohappen,8,Thu Jan 8 05:46:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, dilated pupils is a common side effect of MDMA. The handful of times I did MDMA I got dilated pupils, while LSD use hasn't given me dilated pupils once (for all I know...plus it's harder to trust mild details like that when you're tripping as that ""breathing"" effect can give you a false positive).  Also, MDMA is mildly hallucinogenic. Colors are significantly more vibrant, hence why everyone on it loves neon lights (especially this girl).  There were a few hallucinogenic effects I can recall from my previous use, but it's pretty vague."
behindthegifs,2robqk,BasedCereal,3,Thu Jan 8 00:48:25 2015 UTC,"It's not known for hallucinogenic effects, but for sensory enhancing effects (and a flood of happy feelings because you're basically flooding your body with dopamine). Generally, if there are hallucinogenic effects, it's because it was cut with something else that is a hallucinogen.  Correction: flooding the body with serotonin."
behindthegifs,2robqk,itsnotgoingtohappen,2,Thu Jan 8 02:20:39 2015 UTC,"Quick correction, it's actually flooding your body with Serotonin and Oxytocin.  Serotonin is the happiness/trippy neurotransmitter (antidepressants tinker with its levels, MDMA inhibits the reuptake of it temporarily, and psychedelics work solely off it if I recall correctly) and oxytocin is the love neurotransmitter (you get this from anything ranging from petting a dog to having sex, and this chemical is responsible for that lovey-dovey, ""I want to hug everyone"" effect MDMA users can experience).  Also, a similar chemical to MDMA known as MDA is known to be much more hallucinogenic than the former, and usually is intended to be taken with MDMA in pressed pills.  Ecstasy at least is hoped to be either pure MDMA or MDMA with MDA.  Molly is usually expected to be pure MDMA though."
behindthegifs,2robqk,M3nt0R,0,Thu Jan 8 08:16:42 2015 UTC,"You're completely right - it's a triple reputake inhibitor, which encompasses dopamine which I always trip up over.   However, I think generally if you buy ecstasy vs mdma, you're anticipating that it's not pure or the same; that's the point of Molly - it's supposed to be pure where ecstasy is not."
behindthegifs,2robqk,BasedCereal,1 point,Thu Jan 8 08:52:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on purity and lsd even at low doses produces more than just breathing object distortion.  Tessellations, spirals, mathematical sequences (like the fibonacci) are all common.  All that being said, there arent very many legit acid producers left after a major lab got raided years back.  I believe the major producers are in western europe.  Most ""acid"" like most other drugs, has been replaced by a quasi-equivalent research chemical that is widely produced and cheap to make..yet still sold as a premium.  Another great example is mdma vs ""molly"""
behindthegifs,2robqk,M3nt0R,0,Thu Jan 8 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"While it is true that LSD is significantly more inconvenient to find these days, it is still readily available.  Many dealers I knew either ""knew a guy who made itcitation needed"" or just ordered the stuff in bulk over SR.  Generally speaking, there aren't too many chemicals out there that can fit on a small blotter tab, let alone be strong enough to trip off of and not give off a strong bitter taste (like all RCs you generally would find being sold as LSD).  For example, if you took a tab that secretly contained 25i-nbome instead of LSD, you'd know within a minute or two because it's irritatingly bitter and can numb your tongue to a degree.  As for my LSD experience, I've only done it a handful of times, all with single tabs. I'm not sure if you consider that as a low dose, as threshold effects are at 20mcg and typical blotter tabs range in dose from 70-150mcg per hit (perhaps you are talking of relative low dose, as you can go well into milligram doses before you die from it) but I had relatively minor effects. Slight color shifts, seeing a bunch of purple and yellow (or was it green), pulsating ground, breathing walls, and tracers that got pretty intense when peaking.  There were some pretty interesting CEVs while coming up though, using a ton of geometry. I don't even know how someone could see mathematical sequences on it though; I can hardly count to ten under the influence lol."
behindthegifs,2robqk,BasedCereal,1 point,Thu Jan 8 08:28:52 2015 UTC,See I was getting 110ug doses and taking 2 at a time.  The psychological and sensory differences are a stark shift.
behindthegifs,2robqk,thisismyworkact,1 point,Thu Jan 8 11:23:30 2015 UTC,Oh yes. I've been hesitant to take that much because the only place I have the time to trip and feel comfortable is at music festivals.  I'll take 2+ tabs once I crash at someone elses place haha.
behindthegifs,2robqk,M3nt0R,3,Thu Jan 8 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was just talking about the feet sensation thing. Don't forget MDMA is a hallicugenic drug, I've taken some very very pure MDMA and gotten what could be described as ""visuals"". But the color changing thing, yeah you're right thsts not gonna happen on MDMA alone."
behindthegifs,2robqk,thisismyworkact,-1,Wed Jan 7 23:32:27 2015 UTC,"You're contradicting yourself.  Mdma is a hallucinogenic.  You've gotten visuals.  But you won't get them on MDMA alone? So what'd you take with it?  Understand most street mdma or molly is really methylene or other research chemicals that have somewhat similar effects but are dirt cheap.  But mdma is mdma. It has to be pretty pure or it's not mdma.    I know mda is often sold as mdma and while theyre cousin molecules and very similar, I've read that mda has more trippy aspects.  Also if you smoke herb on either you're more likely to get visuals though I feel the herb detracts from the emotional sensory rush as a whole and smoking should be reserved for the comedown phase.  At least the first few times you try it so you can get a true feel for the magic that is mdma."
behindthegifs,2robqk,M3nt0R,2,Thu Jan 8 01:22:52 2015 UTC,"Naw not really. The animation depicts rapid, vibrant, color changing. Visuals more refer to breathing, texture (apparent not tactile). Also : I was taking mdma, it had been tested infront of me and came from a trusted source.  Thanks for educating those whom do not know though :)"
behindthegifs,2robqk,thisismyworkact,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"I sort of used you as a jumpoff to make that announcement to the readers in a sense.  When I was 16 I remember taking ecstasy pills every weekend, and there was a website pillreports I think it was where you can look up your region/state, pill color, and logo, and it'd give you a breakdown of what the composition of the pills were based on users testing them in your particular region.  That site was pretty baller, especially because this was about 10 years ago and the internet as we know it was not the internet as we knew it 10 years ago.  For a resource like that to exist and have most of the pills I'd look up, it took a tremendous effort from the community to pull through and share their results."

The drugs hallucinogenic effects are pretty mild and often not even present at all. The effects are much greater in terms of emotion (euphoria, empathy, excitement) and energy.   Here's another fun comparison chart, take it with a grain of salt though, it's meant to be funny.  If you're interested there are some very good /r/Drugs AMAs about MDMA"
