GymMemes,3aejri,klikka89,6,Fri Jun 19 16:44:33 2015 UTC,He's probably not lifting heavy enough to need one.
GymMemes,3aejri,VinylGuy420,4,Fri Jun 19 23:45:54 2015 UTC,The purpose of the belt is to build abdominal tension to increase the amount of weight you lift. It can be utilized by novices just as those who are squatting 500lbs.
GymMemes,3aejri,Wolfman87,0,Sat Jun 20 00:02:59 2015 UTC,Just because it can be used doesn't mean it's needed.
GymMemes,3aejri,LifeBeginsAt10kRPM,3,Sat Jun 20 11:16:19 2015 UTC,I never said it was. But the comment I replied to implied that there was a weight where it was necessary. Technically you could squat your whole life and never need a belt. A belt is useful regardless of experience level and unnecessary regardless of experience level.
GymMemes,3aejri,Wolfman87,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"If your belt weighs more than what you're lifting, you don't need it."

GymMemes,3a76jn,BearPf,3,Thu Jun 18 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, every human being is not capable of doing a straddle split to full depth.  This is due to the way your femurs connect to your hip bone.  Some people's femur joints socket a specific way that means the bone just smashes against the hip before they ever get the chance to make full depth.  You can get VERY close though (I speak from experience).    Everyone IS capable of doing front/back splits to full depth with enough training."

I once saw a woman who decided that normal dumbell side bends were too mainstream and decided to make her own variation. She would take 2 35lbs plates, put them down, stand with one foot on each plate (in the middle of the plate) and then do her side bends. I would be like WTF difference does that make. I have seen so many crazy variations of crunches in my life that its crazy."

These were people who are just starting their fitness journey, they see some retarded shit like this on a website, and give it a try. There isn't anything this movement does that can't be done in a safer, less humiliating way.  The only method of locking the weight involves rotating the bar by moving your ankles such that your feet are no longer directly under the bar. If you rotate and the machine doesn't catch, you're fucked"
