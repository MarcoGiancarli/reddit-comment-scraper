He seems to me quite canny, for all I profoundly disagree with him, so I suspect there are reasons behind this shit, although we may never be privity to them."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,chrisrazor,5,Tue Jul 21 11:16:14 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same.  They say you shouldn't mistake idiocy for malice but in his case I think it is actually because he wants to make his mark and doesn't give a damn who suffers.  Its not like he's even trying to 'do the right thing.'  The way he gets angry when he speaks as well seems to imply that he actually detests the average citizen and regards them as punks to be had.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,lifehurtz,74,Tue Jul 21 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"He gives a good speech, appears to have a solid grasp on a subject, then chooses to do the absolute worst option possible. It's like Conservatives of the 80s all over again. They were doing all the wrong things for all the right reasons (Dismantling unions which crippled the country - good, closing mines for dogmatic reasons and denying healthcare to the children of protesters on political grounds - bad). If we're in for a rerun of Thatcher's first term then I honestly don't think Britain has the resilience to withstand such an onslaught any more."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Miserygut,52,Tue Jul 21 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about him giving a good speech, he isn't that charismatic"
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Nightstark,11,Tue Jul 21 12:55:43 2015 UTC,"Conservatives are taking their opportunity.. they have a strong mandate and it's early into their term; and on the back of having recently been frustrated by the Liberal Democrats.  There's little surprise in what we see now but he's not wrong that Cameron is dangerous. The liability follows from the populations not providing enough resistance to bad politics but perhaps that will change in time. Sometimes change only happens from strong leadership but there is a danger of going too far, undermining what is good and progressive. Conservatives are naturally drawn to what frustrates progress.  Hopefully, we'll see a stronger appetite and appreciation of liberal values, as a natural reaction to the nasty party indulging itself.  Edit: for those contesting that they have a strong mandate, bare in mind they have half the Labour party to play with ;p </ducks>"
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,davidpbrown,12,Tue Jul 21 10:23:54 2015 UTC,"While ""strong"" is a relative term, its hard to call a wafer thin majority on a evaporating percentage of the electorate a ""strong"" mandate.  But we have a sufficiently broken system that's not required."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,m1ndwipe,6,Tue Jul 21 10:40:24 2015 UTC,"They got a 12 seat majority, a 6 point lead on Labour and saw the LibDems fairly decimated. The contrast with the previous election was stark. I don't like it, anymore than any other liberal voter but it's there and understating it doesn't help recognise the risks related to that; the Conservatives are taking their opportunity while they have it.."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,davidpbrown,5,Tue Jul 21 10:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty thin,  he will struggle as the Parliament term wears on.  There will be rebels over Europe for sure.    And there will be by-elections, which normally the incumbent party does worse in."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,DrellVanguard,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:09 2015 UTC,Let's hope the worst is over then and that resistance to their nonsense does build sooner rather than later. The worst outcome would be undoing fundamentals like the HRA and having them put in place elements of some neo-Conservative constitution.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,davidpbrown,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:14 2015 UTC,"12 seats is nothing but a constant compromise in practical terms. Thatcher got a strong mandate. Blair got a strong mandate. Cameron has a constant potentially disasterous backbench rebellion, and has to watch his step closely. He is just 12 votes away from being embarrassed, and his party has a broad spectrum of views. He has to do a very delicate balancing act."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,vicar-me-baby,2,Tue Jul 21 12:04:40 2015 UTC,Yes but.  He has a majority of 12 within his own party.  Add the Ulster Unionists.  Remember that politics is now in a pretty central space; anything controversial is likely to appeal to a rump of Lib Dems and Blue Labour types.    I suspect he'll lose fewer crucial votes than we think he will.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,u38cg,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. Because the votes will be on watered-down, compromise policies which he knows he has the votes to pass, and which don't annoy more than 6 of his MPs so much that they will vote against it.  His power is much reduced. Because he did not get a strong mandate."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,vicar-me-baby,5,Tue Jul 21 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"Well, that's politics.  You can only do what you can muster votes for.  Blair lost votes.  The coalition lost votes.    And he has to annoy 12 of his MPs plus ten DUP/UUP plus whoever else in the Lib Dems or Labour will vote for him, and if it's something controversial then probably a few will cross.  It really isn't that slender."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,u38cg,2,Tue Jul 21 12:45:22 2015 UTC,"There are only two UU MPs, not exactly amazing :p"
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,lets_chill_dude,4,Tue Jul 21 13:32:50 2015 UTC,Don't forget that the Tory majority could disappear if just 6 of their MP's refuse to vote with the government on any issue. John Major had a majority of 21 after the 1992 election but he had to deal with rebellions that made that majority look very precarious at best. With subsequent by-election defeats that majority was gone by 1996. Cameron will indeed have to watch his step in the next five years.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,gereth,0,Tue Jul 21 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"Relative to the preditions that the UK was in for European-like hung-parliaments, it was a decisive win. That it's not 100%, doesn't suggest that it's far removed from the balance we all would prefer - subject to understanding the problems with the Conservatives."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,davidpbrown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. relative to a colation it is a strong position. Like I said: Thatcher had a strong mandate in 1983 with a majority of 144.  Likewise Blair in 1997, with a majority of 179.  John Major squeaked home in 1992 with a majority of 21, and a party in chaos, and his government was very weak indeed.  Cameron has 12.  Carmeron does not have a strong mandate. Cameron has a government which is almost twice as weak to rebellion and by-elections as John Major's was. And that was one weak government."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,vicar-me-baby,6,Tue Jul 21 12:22:53 2015 UTC,36% of the vote is a pretty crappy mandate. The Lib Dems in the Lords (with 8% of the Parliamentarians to match their 8% vote share) are causing them problems as they are significantly outnumbered
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Roob86,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"I think this will be their undoing. They'll overindulge themselves under the guise of having a ""strong mandate"", but actually the majority of the public don't support them and they'll only piss more people off over time. I've already seen quite a few people I know mention how they regret voting for the Tories."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,DorsalAxe,-6,Tue Jul 21 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, we'll see a stronger appetite and appreciation of liberal values, as a natural reaction to the nasty party indulging itself.   We probably will, and then one day we'll get a more liberal government which looks like making strides towards a more just and equal society, but will end up being crucified for something circumstantial, like an economic downturn, or for getting stuck between a rock and a hard place on foreign policy, and conservatives will re-emerge once more."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,joethesaint,4,Tue Jul 21 12:00:59 2015 UTC,"Because liberals can do no wrong, and conservatives can do no right? I think it's important to have a good balance of both."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Tranzlater,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"That cycle is natural enough. No progress is without flaws, it takes a lot to embed progress system-wide. What is important is that given the opportunity, liberal politics puts in place milestones that do set out rights and liberties, which make the rational case and encourage constructive debate rather than all the normal fallacies that politics is prone to."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,davidpbrown,2,Tue Jul 21 12:05:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really call 36% of the vote a strong mandate. Only a quarter of eligible voters wanted them in and the rest wanted much less corporate friendly policies based on the manifestos of the other parties. With a majority of 12 I think this government is on fairly unstable footing.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,PantuTheDog,41,Tue Jul 21 12:06:45 2015 UTC,This would be a good argument if anyone else had got more votes.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,u38cg,21,Tue Jul 21 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"It's still a good argument. It shouldn't be the fact that a party that didn't get a majority of the votes gets a majority of the seats, sure they should have gotten the most seats, but not a majority."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,TheNinjaFish,2,Tue Jul 21 13:00:30 2015 UTC,"Why should there be any link between vote share and seats?  We have a system of representative democracy.  The constituency elects the member.  Personally I'd like to see Approval Voting, but no-one listens to me."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,u38cg,18,Tue Jul 21 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"Our system is barely representative. In our current system, up to 70% of a constituency could vote against a candidate and that candidate may still win, meaning 70% of the people in that constituency would have their votes wasted.  Approval Voting is slightly better than FPTP, but it could be more representative. I believe the best way to go is STV, with multi-seat constituencies, allowing for a better link between vote-share and seats won."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,TheNinjaFish,3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you don't vote against a candidate, you vote for a candidate.  If not enough people vote for your candidate, tough.  Democracy isn't about how much you hate the other guy.  And it's easy to construct pathological examples; if you had 100 candidates, 98% could vote against you and you could still win.    This fetish that a direct link between vote share and number of seats is a good thing is stupid."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,u38cg,6,Tue Jul 21 13:27:48 2015 UTC,"it's easy to construct pathological examples   This is literally the case though, nationally around 65% of people who voted did not vote for the Conservatives, the majority of the electorate did not want the Tories to form a government, yet they were still able to get a majority.   This fetish that a direct link between vote share and number of seats is a good thing is stupid.   That's what democracy is! I really don't understand where you're coming from, the seats won should reflect, as accurately as possible, the wishes of the electorate, because that's democracy!"

unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Alwaysfair,7,Tue Jul 21 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"Give over.  Scratch the surface of the Conservatives and we see the nasty party.  The Conservatives attract the selfish and short-sighted for a reason. You only need to look at the way they gift more power and wealth to the existing power and wealth, to have the problem sat right in front of you. Trouble is, that conservative minds do not see a problem with ever more centralised power and wealth, principally because those same supporters tend to be from the already privileged who from lack of real world experience then consider themselves better than others.  People dislike Tories for the same reason they dislike Libertarians - selfish people we not want in power.. looking after your own and putting down those you don't relate to, does not make for Good Government. The Conservatives would call themselves ""Alwaysfair"" too but saying shit doesn't make it true. They are in it for themselves not for progressing the greater good."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,davidpbrown,3,Tue Jul 21 13:40:17 2015 UTC,Less than a quarter of the electorate is not a strong mandate.   One of the many reasons we need PR is so that the largest parry stops acting like it has a right to ignore everyone else's opinion.

unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Morsrael,7,Tue Jul 21 13:26:18 2015 UTC,And you think they wouldn't cast a protest vote for UKIP under PR?  I have bad news for you: there's no evidence that's the case.  There are a lot of UKIP votes being cast in close races where a tactical UKIP voter should in theory care about who wins.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,u38cg,4,Tue Jul 21 13:29:36 2015 UTC,Yea let's not make strawmen based on things I didn't say shall we?  My point was that an election under PR would look different to an election under FPTP. Am I wrong?

I'd say the coalition was certainly a place holder. Unfortunately (for liberal voters) it seems the general populace made up their mind during those 5 years which direction they wanted to push in. And its definitely been to the right. The whole political spectrum seems to have shifted to the right. The new center left is the old center right."

I'm just pointing out that the election result isn't the full story, seeing as only two thirds of the electorate turned out.   Almost half of those voted for a leftwing option, and for the remaining third of the electorate we don't know where they stand. We can't just assume they feel more-or-less the same, on average, as everyone else. Some surely don't care, but what if there's a huge constituency of radical jihadists or radical marxists or radical Jedis or whatever, who simply weren't offered a suitable candidate?   My own personal theory, which is somewhat backed up by numbers, is that a sizeable quantity of former Labour and Lib Dem voters simply couldn't bring themselves to continue their support of that party, but didn't like anything else on offer either. A fresh alternative could potentially scoop up those disillusioned folk, who represent a sizeable chunk of the electorate."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,cathartis,5,Tue Jul 21 13:39:52 2015 UTC,Indeed. But we have a system that discourages minority viewpoints from voting. There is no reason to think there wouldn't be a different vote distribution under PR.  Our system is so broken even vote share is a poor argument for specific situations.

Iraq and Afghanistan: Still unstable, and getting more unstable with every drone strike.  Guantanamo: Still not closed  Getting Osama: A success.

Banks: He has completely failed to implement any serious banking reform to prevent another 2008 style crash, and his officials have gone out of their way to avoid jailing many of those involved in blatantly fraudulent practices.  Environment: He says nice things about stopping global warming, and then poses for photo-ops in front of oil pipe lines. Fail.

unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Frankeh,7,Tue Jul 21 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"The damage that can be done in one term by a majority party is potentially massive.   I've always been of the view that economic recovery has occurred 'despite' Tory policy, not because of it. This will obviously become apparent one way or another within this term.  That aside I think while Cameron may not become a war criminal, the damage done by mass privatisation can quickly get out of hand. It takes bloody ages and a lot of money to build large public organisations, but not long at all to sell them off.  My deepest fear is that in one term bought by cleverly misdirected ire the Tories will manage to accomplish near-as-true total destruction of public organisations like the BBC, Post Office (already a done deal), schools and yeah, the NHS.   Last time it was the houses, public transport and industry, this time I fear it will be media, communications, health and education. Oh and throw in the tearing down pillars of welfare while people starve too.  What I do see happening though is devolution of powers, which normally I'd support entirely if I weren't AGAIN afraid, afraid that Cameron is so eager to devolve powers to Scotland and thus divide the electorate sufficiently to cement his party as the top cat in a one party 'democracy' that is England, which is all they care about really.  As a North Westerner, please take us with you :("
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,meetchu,7,Tue Jul 21 12:02:21 2015 UTC,"Just to take one of your paragraphs...  The near-as-true total destruction you talk of was a done deal under governments before it. I get that are regional variances of opinion on this one... Mainly because of post code lotteries and all those kinds of things...  But the Post Office was a money sink already. It had to be sold off. We were pouring tax pound after tax pound into something that was no longer competitive. Now, admittedly, the entire situation with deliveries and the UK as a whole is terrible... but you know what, I'd rather my taxes were invested in businesses that made money. Especially when we all don't like paying tax!  As for the BBC. Sure, okay... we all use BBC News every day. But is it right that the TV License is used for that website? That's the question. The whole thing is up for renewal (a charter from a long long time ago dictates when that was). It's right we discuss it.  As for the NHS... one day someone will figure out how to manage that beast. But when people getting ill aren't getting in front of doctors (which has nearly killed me personally... not exaggerating) then something is wrong. Not saying destruction is the right thing... but again... it needs looking at as a whole.   The media will grasp onto privatisation as it gets readers/viewers. All that's happening here is things being looked at and reviewed.  I personally think... as PMs go... at least he has a plan; he's not afraid to execute it."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Marshyq,3,Tue Jul 21 12:24:36 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with the decision to float the PO, what I'm disagreeing with is the decision to sell the majority stake - and for not even a particularly good price. It just seems to me that the Tory government policy seems to be ""if a problem is difficult to solve, privatize it and let it be someone else's"". Which is fine, except when it's a public utility. Solve the problem and make the entity work for the electorate, don't pass it on to a private enterprise, that's not in public interest. Yeah it saves tax, but then whoever gets the PO will be charged tax, which they will then pass on to the consumer, with a load of overhead and for-profit shenanigans on top.  As for the BBC, I should have been more specific. I'm worried about the proposal that changed the funding model and subsequent agreement with the BBC, specifically the proposal to change to a tariff based model (which to my understanding basically turns the BBC into Sky). Again with the ""privatize the complex and scary things"" mentality.   I think currently the BBC is a unique entity in that it's state media that is independent from the state, and that should remain intact. From my understanding, and conversations I've had within the BBC, the corporation is not state owned - it's association with the government comes in where the government agreed to compel people to pay TV Licenses. In exchange the BBC has to provide balanced, unbiased news coverage, programming for everyone, and programming with merit (generally educational), and will not include adverts. For me, this arrangement absolutely has to remain. I completely accept that the state of broadcasting has changed more than anyone could have known when that charter was written, but rather than talk about changing the funding model, talk about the ""broadcast for everyone"" clause, and also what it means to broadcast. Allow the BBC more freedom in what it can and cannot show, and allow it to exclusively broadcast niche content online. Again this is just some ideas, a proper discussion needs to be had by people more qualified than I.  The NHS is a cumbersome beast, in many ways it is hampered by both its age and size. I think it's become clear that whatever is needed to make it truly efficient will involve fundamental changes from the very foundation of the NHS. Of course the issue here is that if said changes don't work... People die, or rather, more people. Look at models used in Switzerland and the Netherlands, both more efficient than the NHS, both newer and less cumbersome. Yeah, the suggestion of ""make is better and more efficient"" is as obvious as it is useless, the real question is ""how?"". I don't know the answer, but I'd rather the government try and figure it out how to make it cost-effective than the private sector try and figure out how to make it profitable.  The ""at least he has a plan"" thing is for me only a positive so long as the plan is a sound one. I disagree with it on most points, so for me it translates as ""dangerous""."

unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,Alwaysfair,3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:17 2015 UTC,The issues of Scottish independence and the EU would have arisen no matter who was in Prime Minister and I don't think ignoring them would have helped.
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,jambox888,4,Tue Jul 21 09:28:36 2015 UTC,"They would have arisen no  matter what but the response from Cameron has been incredibly short-term and rushed. A few hours after the Scottish referendum results he comes out and declares the half-arsed EVEL policy to help consolidate the English Tory base and pushes the issue into the next parliament. In a fit of panic over UKIPs triumph at the European elections Cameron comes out and announces a EU referendum (obviously years away in the next parliament so he doesn't have to deal with the issue now) so he can one up UKIP and consolidate the Tory base again.   His response to both matters shows a distinctly short term mannerism and the desire to play politics to keep his party together. Paddy isn't saying that ignoring them would have been better, quite the opposite, a well thought out and more cross-party approach would have put the UK in a much better position."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,chrisrazor,8,Tue Jul 21 10:18:37 2015 UTC,"he comes out and declares the half-arsed EVEL policy to help consolidate the English Tory base   Well yes, he would have been stupid not to, the Scottish referendum has sparked English nationalism to reemerge and quite rightly so.     obviously years away in the next parliament so he doesn't have to deal with the issue now   Well during a negotiations it's wise to give yourself enough time to get a good deal, plus  I'm not sure the public would be ready for or even want a snap vote.   so he can one up UKIP and consolidate the Tory base again.    More likely head off his own backbenchers. I don't see the problem here though, this is how politics works, protests parties are designed to make these issues heard, which they have.     a well thought out and more cross-party approach would have put the UK in a much better position.   The Scottish question has been approached across party lines and now so is the EU referendum. I really don't see the issues with any of this."

It was only well into the referendum run up when it became apparant how close it would be that they suddenly realised they had to actually do something. Addressing the concerns seriously well in advance would have defused the whole issue.    It certainly does seem to agree with the opionion stated, that it was short term and unthinking. As if they hadn't really bothered to do anything about Scotland, and put in the minimum effort only when they had to. Now the referendum is over, they're back to not giving a shit."

But then Paddy is coming at this from a political angle so obviously wants to emphasis his points.   Its also looking into the future i think and if you take a worse case scenario (from my perspective obviously for many this would be a best case scenario i understand) in 5 years time the UK could be out of Europe, have a completely un-rescueable union with complete animosity on both sides, be out of the European human rights act, and endured 5 more years of crippling cuts and austerity. granted that probably wont all happen, but that's still a pretty bleak outlook."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,oliethefolie,8,Tue Jul 21 10:37:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. Most of these Tory policies are simply things that broadly represent the center (or new centre, if you will) of British politics. I see nothing crazy or outlandish at all. I think Paddy just doesn't like the shift in popular sentiment he's seen and the pace of change feels surprising -- but it's broadly what the majority of  people want."
unitedkingdom,3e1s0v,ArtistEngineer,7,Tue Jul 21 10:49:57 2015 UTC,"I think this is going to be a real issue for decades to come: parties want to continue swinging strongly left or right, when the more popular parties are consistently closer to the middle.  Both Ukip and Green fans think that their regularly increasing support (which are often insignificant anyway) is in anticipation of a full revolution in Britain. The current Labour leadership election has people simultaneously exaggerating Corbyn's popularity and understating Kendall's popularity.  But the more passionate of voters are the ones with stronger opinions, and are subsequently unable to see the wood for the trees."

They are always trying to persuade us the alternative to them is the devil in carnate or any plan not of their devising will bring about the fall of man kind.

The reason, Madam Home Secretary, that we distinguish between the two is that we send people who plot violence to prison while people spouting nonsense covers half the population (including yourself). It's pretty important to be able to tell which ones should be behind bars and which ones are someone's dotty old grandad.

Edit:  Because I really try to be fair in my comments:  Looking at the Guardian I did find this in a comment piece by Mohammed Shafiq   If freedom of speech is a great British value, as the prime minister claimed, then we must all fight any attempts to restrict it.  I abhor what Tommy Robinson and Anjem Choudary stand for and what they say, but removing Choudary’s right to free speech will restrict our ability to confront him. The government has plans to do away with the civil liberties of our citizens through the snooper’s charter; this legislation will affect all communities and must be resisted.   Hmm.

unitedkingdom,3e1tpq,stronimo,5,Tue Jul 21 12:28:04 2015 UTC,"Good article thanks.    I especially like this bit:   A YouGov survey last year revealed that a full 86% of Guardian readers wanted Page 3 stopped (by whom?), against two thirds of Sun readers who wanted it retained. Sun readers were not invited to suggest offending content for censorship in the Guardian."
unitedkingdom,3e1tpq,backtowriting,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"It's a bit awkward quoting the Guardian's ""Comment Is Free"" section as a way to talk about the paper's attitudes. That's their public column that anyone can write an article for. It quite often carries pieces that are polar opposites of each other, or ones by right-wing columnists."
unitedkingdom,3e1tpq,aslate,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:18 2015 UTC,"I don't agree.

But, this is a problem which is affecting the quality of this subreddit and I'm not going to shut up about it when I see politely worded thoughtful comments downvoted simply because of disagreement.  Do you want this subreddit to be a place where we have actual debates about genuinely controversial topics, or do you want it to be a place where only the most popular view gets heard?"

I think it's worth pointing out that this is still an example of free speech. I can use my speech to protest someone else's and call for some kind of action to be taken. Their boss can use their own freedom of speech to tell me to mind my own business... and so forth. Now, calling for him to be arrested for saying it - that's the line.  Freedom of speech doesn't mean we all have to sit here and idly accept whatever someone says every time they say something."
unitedkingdom,3e1tpq,tizz66,3,Tue Jul 21 11:47:26 2015 UTC,"This is a prime example of the problem with the current progressive understanding of (and sneering contempt for) free speech. If all the concept means is not getting arrested by the state for what you say, and harassment, boycotts, denial of access to private media and public platforms (hello NUS), arbitrary loss of employment and means of income are all totally cool responses to unpopular speech, then the concept is worthless for anyone not a millionaire hermit.  And that's not even touching the growth of hate speech and 'public distress' laws to the point where sometimes the state actually will come and arrest you."
unitedkingdom,3e1tpq,Nithing,4,Tue Jul 21 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"So what's your solution? Is it to say someone can't call for any kind of action against anyone else? Have you thought through how that might work and what it might mean for society, let alone how it impacts someone else's freedom to speak?  Freedom of speech isn't, never has been and never will be carte blanche to say what you want with no consequences. If your speech is controversial there may very well be strong consequences for you by saying it, but that doesn't deny you the right all the same. Note that when I talk of 'consequences' here, I refer to one citizen's response to another. Freedom of speech protects (well, should protect) you from the government interfering with what you say.  I can't help but feel you and the OP in this thread have a fundamental misunderstanding of what freedom of speech is and means. If your point is that people should be a little more tolerant before automatically jumping to the 'sack him!' stance, then I think there's probably room for us to agree. But it doesn't sound like, from what you've said, that that's your view."
unitedkingdom,3e1tpq,tizz66,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"In practical terms, how about we start with adding ""a Twitter lynch mob called for their sacking because they said something *ist"" to the list of things that fall under Unfair Dismissal?

Trying to shut people up or have them fired because they  have said something you don't like may be perfectly legal, but it is against free-speech principles and it does make me question Shafiq's commitment to freedom of speech."

No - the principle of free speech is that everyone can say what they like, and everyone else can tell them to piss off. No-one gets an automatic right to a platform."

He has the absolute right to protest Jesus and Mo cartoons.  But, for me, it does ruin his credibility as an authority on free-speech.    Edit:  Badly worded.  It's not simply that he protested the cartoons.  It's the fact that he tried to have a Lib Dem candidate deselected because that candidate tweeted a cartoon he objected to."

Conservatives tend to be, as the name suggests, more conservative & wanting to keep the status quo. They are generally more isolationist & protectionist in their policies."

And as for education, maybe I'm biased as I'm starting university in september (I'm 24, and luckily did an access course last year which enabled me to study, as they are getting de-funded.)

Police choose not to charge people regularly, for domestic disturbances, violence, speeding, etc - Application of the law is not always black and white.  In this case, I'd imagine the Police have looked at the crime in the context of effective policing - i.e. they've weighed up the pros and cons and decided they can better serve the public by looking at other, more serious crimes."

The met have decided that they will no longer deal with lost property, for example, something the police have always dealt with in the past. The next conversation there will be around missing persons, and that will be pushing a lot of work back in the lap of the social services who are just as strapped as the police, with a risk that people could fall through the gaps.  Durham is a tiny force. The decision not to undertake proactive searching for cannabis growing is going to be in the context of whether those officers are better placed doing other things. Like dealing with mispers.  There should be some sort of reasoned debate about all this, but if all government is saying is ""do more with less"", then someone will have to make a decision at some point and, inevitably, it'll have to be the people doing the work if no other bugger can suggest what to do."

However, they have limited resources, they do have to prioritize which crimes they focus their efforts on.  In this case, it seems like they are going to stop actively searching for small-scale cannabis farms, and in cases where they do discover these, or discover people possession of weed, they're going to offer some sort of rehabilitation course rather than a criminal prosecution. It seems similar to sending speeding drivers onto a speed awareness course rather than giving them points on their license. For low level crimes like cannabis possession, that makes sense. They are still policing it, but rather than charging people with a criminal offense, they are trying to prevent repeat offending."

I also have to point out though that I don't see anything official using the word ""offend"", they use ""uncomfortable""  I found some more info from Pink News   It continued: “It was felt by the group within the Trans/Non Binary Caucus that some drag performance, particularly cis drag, hinges on the social view of gender and making it into a joke, however transgender individuals do not feel as though their gender identity is a joke.  “This can particularly difficult for those who are not out and still present as the gender they were assigned at birth. While it was discussed whether we could have trans drag acts perform, it was agreed that as it would not be appropriate to ask any prospective drag acts whether or not they identified as trans.   Still nowhere does it use ""offend"". That word is a fucking dogwhistle.  Personally I still agree with the main Pride organisers:   “As an organisation Pride Glasgow had a similar discussion back in 2010 over how Drag could cause discomfort to people however we took the decision that Drag Queens and Kings play an important part in the history of the Pride movement and should be included within the event, so we used our Pride Guide to address these concerns by having a statement from Crosslynx (a Trans support organisation at the time) explaining that not everyone people would see in Drag at Pride would be Trans or represent the trans community.  “Pride Glasgow believes that any community group should be given their place to flourish but that success should not be built on the negativity and ignorance towards other events, groups and like minded people and we are saddened to see that this is the direction that Free Pride has chosen to take.""   I could understand if it was drag done ""for a laugh"" and not respecting trans people or the longstanding tradition and culture of drag, but that's not even slightly the case here."

People who do drag don't necessarily identify as the gender they perform as, whereas trans people do. That's where a lot of trans people have an issue - they see drag queens as putting on their identity as a costume and a performance, but for them it's their day to day lives.

Because the organisers didn't know what Drag Kings (or Faux Queens) were. And I wish I were making that up. In the discussions on their facebook page (mostly removed) they didn't know such things existed. They put their reasoning down to watching an episode of Ru Paul where one drag queen said something transphobic, read a couple of articles on it, and came to this decision.   Then, some trans drag acts (which I'll presume is as you say) complained they were trans and being excluded, so they ""relaxed"" the rules.   So now drag is allowed.

So what Sylvia & Marsha did, is they went ahead of the opening banner as two transvestites with some friends, they marched in front of the parade so it made them end up leading the whole parade! So the committee decided 'well, we've gotta start including transvestites in our parade'"" - Randolfe Wicker, Human Rights Activist   ""She would talk about how there was nobody to represent her and her rights as a transvestite, 'cause they had all these gay men and all these gay women working at the gay center, but they had no transvestites.

Should I be discussing ways of tackling graffiti with such folk before establishing and working on the latest gay agenda™?"
unitedkingdom,3e1zot,istillfeelyou,4,Tue Jul 21 12:13:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really say that humanist ideals are an agenda as such. It's just hard to argue in favour of a humanist society with equal rights whilst robbing others of theirs due to your own over-sensitivity as these folks do.  Beyond that there's obviously no wider organisation of belief.

unitedkingdom,3e1zot,grogipher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:16 2015 UTC,"It's not beyond parody, whatsoever.   Yes it is.   Let's take a step back and think about what they are doing.   They are discriminating against people, based on their gender identity. Do we want to think about that for a bit? Some transgender people have taken it upon themselves to discriminate based on the same thing that they themselves face discrimination for. That's quite literally the daily-mash level stuff, and so it does, to me, read as parody.    It's a sensitive subject   No one has said otherwise that I can see, I certainly haven't.    being tackled by people who're much more empathetic towards those struggling with sexual identity than you are.    Um, do you want to give any evidence for such a baseless claim?    You don't approve...    No, I do not.    ... or understand ...    That's another baseless assertion. You have no idea of my level of knowledge.    ... and why would I or they expect you to.   Because if they want to move society on at all, they have to take society with them. Not exclude people, build up their own barriers, and bitch about the rest of us not playing ball. This is exactly how to create resentment both within the LGBT community and between the LGBT community and the rest of the world.   They have absolutely no need to explain themselves to anyone, but neither do they or you have any grounds to whinge that we're not in approval.   This whole thing is an absolute nonsense, they're bringing lots of negative press onto a community I'm heavily involved with, they're furthering discrimination on the basis of gender identity, they're further building on entrenched binary gender identities, they're creating resentment between drag performers and trans people, and they're going to result in more trans people getting bad treatment - I've already seen some examples of this. They're a fucking embarrassment, and the quicker they grow up, the better."

She's losing £1500 a year in tax credits, i.e. over 10% of her income. I'm glad that the people who caused the financial trouble are being justly punished, I mean it was her manipulating markets and giving dodgy loans out so it's only fair she takes the brunt of it."

Losing £1500 of your income literally because you are a single parent who works is deplorable, but I'm glad you've got yours and everyone else can fuck off.

That is a not-insignificant section of our population, and it's especially accentuated in areas which are less economically developed such as the north-east of England.   Also, so it's alright to divorce for money, but it's not OK to have kids for the money? That is stupid logic, and irrelevant as neither of those things have happened.

Netflix being a library of movies and TV series whereas iPlayer is a catch up service with limited archival of shows. You can't watch entire seasons of Doctor Who (just to pick something out of the air) on iPlayer, yet you won't be able to watch the latest episode on Netflix.    Reintroducing iPlayer to the US and other markets on a subscription basis won't cannibalize online revenues, and the impact it will have on traditional broadcasters over there will be minimal in the grand scheme of things. The broadcasters need to adapt to how we consume media. The BBC did a great job with iPlayer. Obviously the drop in revenues from less people with tv licences is something that needs to be addressed, but the beeb is leading the way. The BBC might lose money from broadcasters in the US, but it will make it back again and then some because people over there will flock to iPlayer in droves."

It’s simply untrue for ministers to say that that this year’s budget is progressive.” Lucas also slammed the Government for favouring the ‘profits of polluters’ over ‘people’s right to live in a safe and habitable climate’:  “The detail of the Finance Bill also flies in the face of the Government’s own rhetoric about the threat of climate change to our economy, society, security and wellbeing. It proposes, for example, to tax renewable energy as if it were a fossil fuel – by removing the climate change levy exemption for renewables.  “This comes alongside the announcement in the Budget to scrap the long-established zero carbon homes policy-meaning that future homes, offices, schools and factories will be more costly to run, locking residents and building users into higher energy bills.  “It’s fossil fuel subsides that should be cut – not support for clean, green, home-grown renewable energy or targets for warmer homes. It’s deeply disappointing to see this Government continue to prioritise the profits of polluters over people’s right to live in a safe and habitable climate.”"

It doesn't really matter what Labour do at this stage of the bill - the Tories will always outvote them.

unitedkingdom,3dzw0s,Sir_Bantersaurus,5,Tue Jul 21 07:47:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. I've tried to have conversations with people myself. Have laid down facts about the misconceptions but people just don't want to even want to consider it.
unitedkingdom,3dzw0s,Partadam,10,Tue Jul 21 10:07:19 2015 UTC,"It's also the perception which has been there long before the Tories won in 2010.   If someone who works a near-minimum wage job is seeing someone who is on benefits living a lifestyle equal, sometimes better, than them at least in terms of material possessions then trying to explain to them that this isn't so much a problem with benefits but the 'low-wage economy' won't get you far. I don't really think this happens anymore but I did live in a town with a big mix of demographic groups and you did see people working minimum-wage jobs finding they have no more spending power than their friends who left school and had a kid.   The problem with the left is a failure to argue in real tangible terms to people and instead having academic 'big picture' arguments. It's the same with immigration. There is little point telling someone whose community has changed drastically, whose school has teachers spending longer on children whose first language isn't English and whose wages are being held down by cheaper workers that immigration is actually a net economic benefit to the wider country. It's true but it doesn't help them.   The Tories can craft a message to the electorate that tells them how they will benefit. They directly addresses their concerns.   I have no doubt the facts you give them are both correct and show how we can all benefit overall. However I suspect it often doesn't directly resonate with their day to day life. That's what Labour needs to think about."
unitedkingdom,3dzw0s,Sir_Bantersaurus,4,Tue Jul 21 10:34:46 2015 UTC,"Do you know what mate? I can't argue with any of that. I suppose the point I try to make to people is that a welfare system isn't an inherently bad thing.

NHS free at the point of use still rallies almost all progressives behind it, but somewhere along the way the left has lost sight of defending welfare as a universal right for those in need so that no one ends up destitute.

unitedkingdom,3dzw0s,DeadeyeDuncan,3,Tue Jul 21 09:37:03 2015 UTC,"The truth is Britain is no longer a country where left wing politics (especially economics) is considered acceptable by the voting public. Labour probably won't exist in a couple of decades, and I don't expect to have a pension or the NHS, or the BBC etc.. by the time I reach retirement age.  They might as well just cut taxes for everyone because I'm not fucking paying for something that's not going to exist in one or two decades.   Except they don't, because conservatives only cut taxes for the rich, reduce subsidies for the poor and increase corporate subsidies for old money industries such as conservative media, defence and fossil fuels.   So they're not even fiscal conservatives, just elitist fascists. You can see in America how they get taxed out of their arse despite the fact that their government provides fuck all except spending massive amounts of money on corporate bullshit and warfare.   I don't even know why anyone pays any fucking tax in the U.S, they can't even maintain their infrastructure anymore. It's going to be like that in the UK soon."
unitedkingdom,3dzw0s,this_sort_of_thing,25,Tue Jul 21 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"You can't cut taxes because your taxes are going into the pocket of the companies who have been signed up to run the government contracts. It's essentially an easy profit if they can drive down their running costs, and if they can do that and still run the service, could we not actually have done that ourselves without contracting it out?   I remember reading somewhere that if one of these companies actually fails to deliver and we want to terminate their contracts, we could have to pay them a settlement to end it early - how the hell is this beneficial? A state-run system, run properly, could react better in some cases - not all clearly - to systemic failures.   I feel this method of introducing the market into welfare programmes and contracting out government services is a massive enabler of cronyism - even if it isn't intentional. How can you have a free market system when only one company is permitted to supply the service based on whomever gets the nod from the government? If you have friends running companies that can provide these services, you can essentially give them favours and have a board position when you retire from politics.  We really need to start stripping out the conflicts of interest from political careers."

Labour, who have always been a left-wing party, are supporting a thoroughly right-wing, fiscally conservative point of view. And it's not like there isn't an alternative view, look at the United States, they have taken a very different approach to economic recovery (growth/stimulus focused) and it has worked out better for them.  It's fine to support something, but when it goes against the grain of your supposed core values then something is seriously amiss. Personally I believe it is because Labour is riddled with self-doubt and cowardice right now, they have been painted into a corner by the conservative narrative that austerity is the only way forward when it clearly isn't.   The SNP are the only big party advocating an alternative solution, as far as I can see. Labour should be doing that. Which coincidentally is exactly why they totally lost Scotland."

unitedkingdom,3dzw0s,tyke-of-yorkshire,7,Tue Jul 21 10:51:51 2015 UTC,"Because austerity is a fiscally conservative strategy that disproportionately impacts public services and the poor.   The reason why 70% of the public support it is because the conservatives won the PR war in 2010. They promoted austerity very effectively and Labour didn't publicly propose an alternative, although they had been trying to stimulate the economy in the 2008-10 period and it had shown signs of early success. When Brown went that all stopped and we had the 'double-dip' in 2011-12.  Labour did try to counter with 'our plan was working until you messed it all up with austerity' but by then the barn door was already wide open and the horse had bolted. The public believed austerity was the only way forward and Labour had no economic credibility because of 2008.  We then find ourselves in the current situation, where Labour have no option (in their view) but to support a policy that they disagreed with in the past (as discussed, goes against their core values, hurts the poor/working class, etc). Which is why people view them as being hypocritical and weak."

Don't mistake a broke voting system for majority support. UKIP are basically a single issue party, leaving the EU is a complex idea that has support from both right and left leaning people (although the rest of their policies are firmly right wing, most people are voting because of the EU thing).

A lower benefit cap is supported by 67% of the public and 47% of labour voters and opposed by 20% of the public and 34% of labour voters.   Labour voters don't like all of it though, but 54% of the public like the inheritance tax cut while 32% don't and 32% of labour like it and 52% don't.   Its pretty much the same for under 21's claiming housing benefit, most people like it, but labour people don't.  The only policies which labour and the public don't like together are the student grants and the freeze in public sector workers wages. All other budget policies are individually more popular with the public or with the public and labour voting people.

To many people £29,500 is a great salary and is more than either of my parents have earned. Of course graduates will earn more than most people so they can afford it, as you said the median income is only ~£24,000 so at £29,500 you are better off than at least 50% of people, more likely 60%.   Also lets put your figures in context, if you paid back £37,000 of debt after working 30 years with an average salary of £29,500 then you have paid back £37,000 out of £885,000, or just 4% of your earnings. Hardly a huge amount considering you wouldn't be getting that much money to begin with if you hadn't gone to university.  Then there is the fact the threshold was raised from £17k for me to £21k for you, that means that if we both got £29,500 a year I would be paying about 50% more in loan repayments a year than you (£1125 compared to £765). So even if you have more debt, I am hit harder at the beginning of my professional career than you.   TL;DR You don't pay a penny unless you are better off than 40% of people (£21k). The percent of your total earnings going to the graduate tax will be tiny and increases if you have a higher income. The new threshold means that post-2012 students are better off when they come out of university and their repayments are lower and more spread out.   As an aside, the best system would be to get rid of this system of loans and instead give all students a grant which covers fees and living costs, then all graduates pay a graduate tax on income above £21k. Even better would be if the each graduate's tax went directly to their university so that universities have an incentive to teach marketable skills along side the degrees to improve their graduate's salaries."

My friend on the other hand, is from a middle class family. His family make a decent living, but refuse to support him. As a result of his family's income, he is only eligible for around half of the maximum. He can't reasonably be expected to live on the money available to him this year. Next year, however, he can claim the same amount as me if he so chooses.   Even very wealthy students can claim the same if they choose, but that's fair too, because they will still have to pay it back in proportion to their earnings, as will everyone else."

Yes; then I've paid enough.  Whether you think you've paid enough is irrelevant. Most taxes other than income taxes are fixed amounts rather than open-ended fixed rates.

unitedkingdom,3e1tbl,34Mbit,3,Tue Jul 21 11:50:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not getting the point.  I have £18k student debt. When I've paid off that ""tax"", it's done, I've paid enough.  That's not the case with any actual tax. The tax I paid as a 14 year old, buying a packet of fags on the sly (I didn't, it's an example, calm down), I'll pay as a 99 year old.   I find the ""it's not a loan, it's a tax"" argument nothing but a convenient way of inuring people to accepting this huge mountain of debt - and making it easier to pile on even more over time. It's a loan you have to pay back. Whether or not you notice it being paid back is irrelevant. Calling it a tax is sophistry and a dangerous falsehood.  If you had an overdraft of £50k+, if you were never in credit, if you were being forced to live your life in debt to the bank, would it not keep you awake at night, even with a perfectly reasonable repayment scheme?  Edit: Also, you pay tax to the Government. Who gets the repayments on your student loans? It's not the Government. Would anyone like to chip in on whether private lending firms can actually impose taxes on the populace? I have a feeling, with no research or evidence to back me up, that they can't.  It's. Not. A.

It even comes straight out of your paycheck, so you don't even see the money.

That's what is unique about higher education support and why it should be loans: because you become higher income AFTER you have them rather than when they have them.

The grants are not tuition fees, which is a whole other issue, they are about attempting to level the playing field between very low income students and those who can easily afford to live as a student. It's rightly government policy to try and make university education as accessible as possible to all potential students making it a low income benefit like any other, your argument is more suited to tuition fees which pay for the actual education.  The reason this already means tested benefit was turned into a loan is pure politics, the government already decided to ring fence every penny pensioners get which may or may not (definitely) have something to do with chasing their votes. The promised cuts still have to come from elsewhere and it's very easy to take from students or potential students because just a whiff of the word ""student"" and people will be chomping at the bit to talk about how we shouldn't be paying to make other people rich. As if levelling the playing field of higher education isn't a soundly principled policy and as if universities are just factories churning out suburban middle class citizens."

unitedkingdom,3e2enb,lorduxbridge,4,Tue Jul 21 14:18:49 2015 UTC,I feel that's probably because the French is more westernized and are more likely to learn English due to the number of countries to use it. Inside the EU German and English is slowly dominating French and most of the old French empire in Africa is turning towards China and the middle east.

You have an increased chance of being able to speak their native language or share a common language as a go between. You also benefit the police service as a whole by being able to assist other colleagues when they encounter someone they don't share a language with but you do. I'm an A+E doctor but I also speak good German and passable Spanish.

The problem with this country is it still wants the foreign blood money but it doesn't want to pay the bribes. Which doesn't make any sense.   Most of the right wing who despise seeing money going to certain type of people don't realise that the money goes towards making the undesirable foreigners far worse in order for Britain to get more money, if they were the real socio-paths they'd see that foreign aid is good for the country.   I'm pretty sure they are, they're just misinformed about the reality of the situation. They've also bought into all the propaganda about Britain actually being one of the good guys.

unitedkingdom,3e26ze,hampa9,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"You can cut the deficit without cutting the budget. Tax revenues in the UK are low, both historically & when compared to many OECD countries. In 2009 for instance tax revenue as a proportion of GDP was 40%, it's current 36%. If you get those revenues up our deficit disappears on its own without cutting anything.   If you look at where we stand in Europe on this issue we're below the OECD avg, and well below our Northern European counterparts. In Denmark revenue was 49% of GDP in 2013, in France 45%, in Belgium 45%, Finland 44%, Sweden 43%, Italy 43%, Austria 43%, the list goes on. If we have revenues like any of these countries we could support vastly larger levels of public spending than we currently afford. This chancellor wants to reduce public spending because of his ideology of having a low tax low spending state that doesn't look after the least fortunate. Over the next 5 years public spending will go below even American spending. Do we really want to be compared to America? A country with booming inequality brought about by right wing religious fanatics only out for themselves. Nordic countries do best by almost any metric, surely they are the countries we should be emulating?   So no, cuts aren't needed. But of course if you insist on cutting taxes for the wealthy while committing yourself to reducing the deficit then of course you have no choice but to cut spending.

If you asked me if spending on say welfare is too much I'd say of course. But let's look at what's actually causing it rather than ideological views about lazy poor people. You want a difficult decision or two to cut the deficit? Means test the pension. Introduce rent controls until housing stock can be brought up to required amounts. Remove the triple lock.

unitedkingdom,3e26ze,justthisplease,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"Print more money or borrow more money?  If it's ""print more money"", then that is a tax on everyone who has GBP, and inflation harms the poorest the most.  Rich people have assets and can divest -- not so easy for the poor.  Printing more money simply isn't an option.  Not to mention how horribly unfair it is to the responsible people who save for a rainy day, only for their savings to be effectively raided by the state once said rainy day occurs.  If it's ""borrow more money"".  Well firstly, the reason rates are so low is perhaps that we are seen to be doing something positive (cutting) in the eyes of the market.  That means we are seen to be likely to pay it back, so I'm not so sure that borrowing would remain cheap if we decided to start spending massively.  Secondly, all this money must be paid back one day, so the question is ""will these investments create more growth in the long run than they cost?""  Well, I'd be very wary of immediately jumping to ""yes, absolutely"".  The state isn't controlled or guided by market forces, it is guided by politics.  Politics has no place in business.  Our computer industry died for this exact reason due to Tony Benn's politicking, for example.  Once we return to growth, there will be huge interest groups, lobbies and vested interests demanding that the state keeps spending this money.  What I'm saying is that if we are not careful, we will struggle to cut spending when the times are good, and all these ""rainy day investments"" will stay, and suddenly we have an even bigger state.  A state even more inbed with big business.  No thank you.   Now I don't know how anyone can argue against all cuts at any cost.  Of course we need to cut, surely the question is how quickly?  You see lots of people say ""make cuts and watch gdp and/or gdp growth fall"", as if that in itself is an argument against cuts.  Well, of course if the government suddenly stops spending £X, then GDP will fall, but that is because it takes time for the capital to be reallocated.  It doesn't actually mean we have lost that wealth, and we are now poorer because of it, if we are it is only for a short while.  So long as the cuts are slow enough to allow people, and the economy, to adjust appropriately.  And lastly, when are we meant to cut?  When the times are good, it's ""spend, spend spend"", and now the times are bad it is also ""spend, spend, spend"".  Why can't we cut now?  We have to make cuts because the world economy is still not out of the woods yet.  We could still yet see a return to economic stagnation, and so we should be prepared.  For what it's worth, I'm not necessarily defending the conservatives, but I am defending the idea of cuts and austerity.  There is no such thing as a free lunch; the state cannot just magically provide us with all we need, and in fact will often make things much worse."

unitedkingdom,3e26ze,bigmantingz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"There wasn't a spree of overspending. There was a global crash that sucked all growth out of the economy.   Think of it this way. If you get sacked tomorrow, should you put your energies into finding a new job or sell all your possessions and cancel your phone and insurance?  We got sacked. We will get back to work, without investment it might not be as good a job straight away but we can make the choice to lay the groundwork for income rises later or stay where we are and adapt to our new level of income.   Now imagine you've got a nice rich family who will lend you cash for say, going back to uni or keeping your car on the road while you await your first pay check and they will lend you money for below market rates.   Oh,  and imagine you also had a magic money tree in the back garden, but if you use it too much everyone notices you're minted and ups their prices when they see you coming."
unitedkingdom,3e26ze,Iainfletcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"There wasn't a spree of overspending. There was a global crash that sucked all growth out of the economy.    Yeah I know.  I don't blame Labour for the crash, I blame the US government.  The fact is that tax receipts fell massively in the economic downturn, and I blame the labour government for expanding spending such a great deal.  They left us in a bad position when the crash arrived.     Think of it this way. If you get sacked tomorrow, should you put your energies into finding a new job or sell all your possessions and cancel your phone and insurance?   Hold on, so is the budget akin to a household budget or not?  Apparently it is when you're pro-spending, but is nothing at all like a household budget as soon as you're pro-austerity.  And anyway, no, if I lost my job I wouldn't sell all my possessions, but I would put off booking my holiday and definitely not eat out as much.  In which case, by your analogy, austerity is justified.     Now imagine you've got a nice rich family who will lend you cash for say, going back to uni or keeping your car on the road while you await your first pay check and they will lend you money for below market rates.   What is your point?  There are plenty of reasons not to go on a spending spree, even if we can borrow cheaply.  Assuming of course borrowing stays cheap as soon as the market, I mean ""rich family"" looks at you and sees your deficit balloon even further.   Oh, and imagine you also had a magic money tree in the back garden, but if you use it too much everyone notices you're minted and ups their prices when they see you coming.    Why would you even mention this?  As if printing money will ever be an option!  A complete nonstarter."

What that does is gives a financial incentive to people on disability benefits to try out work, and gives them a guarantee that their benefit won't be touched. If they get up to working 15 hours a week, they will consider going full time when the 2 years ends.  Quite obviously that will encourage more people back into work than the new system will."

Seems like a waste of money to pay someone full ESA for up to two whole years whilst they top up over and beyond that with work. If you're well enough to work hours that some single parents have to work you should be well enough to subsidise your ESA with your wage.  I guess they expect you to want to work and not look for an easy out. They don't call it work for nothing.

They then assumed they would get this 15%, and it was automatically added to the council tax bill from the end of the 14-15 tax year, without telling anyone.  Then they failed to properly publicise this change, or the PCC was an idiot, I'm not totally sure, and most people voted that they should only get their 2% increase (a lot of people seemed to think the 15.8% was on their entire council tax bill! It wasn't, it was just on the police's portion - it worked out to £30 a year average)  This meant they had to spend £600k to correct everyone's council tax bills, refund money, etc.  So now they have even less money than their worst-case projection (getting 2% more) could have forecast..."

It was a bitterly cold winter, fuel prices were going up and working conditions and wages weren't being kept up with inflation at 26%. MP's decided to give wage increases a capped 5% increase which the unions agreed. When inflation dropped the cap wasn't lifted and that kicked off the unions who were incredibly powerful. First Ford workers about 50k - then others and they got a 17% wage increase. That was the tipping point for lots of others who wanted the same including lorry drivers demanding 40%. They ground the country to a halt. No one could get fuel, food was scarce and it was bitterly cold. 1.5 million people walked out of work. Dead bodies stacked up, rubbish filled town centres, hospitals were turning people away. The unions had lost control of their workers and people were striking left right and centre. It was more of a national mental epidemic than decisions by individuals, but it was also a post war economy struggling to find cash to keep the country going. We were bankrupt and the IMF stepped in and bailed us out."

China grew faster than the UK in 2014 but it remains classified as a 'developing' economy despite being four times larger than the UK economy. 7.4% growth. India also grew faster than the UK but, despite being a top 10 global economy, is not classified by the IMF as a 'major' economy. 5.4% growth. Productivity remains lower than 2007, unprecedented since the war. The growth we're seeing is mainly down to cheap labour driven by migration and stalled wage growth.  Unemployment is falling overall but the new jobs are at the very bottom end of the pay-scale.  US growth is forecast at 3.1% this year, and will certainly overtake the UK, just as it has in the past. Our Real GDP growth rate is 3.20 or 97th in the world. India and China are at 7.4, and we're being outpaced by Ecuador and Malaysia.  We are not even in the top 20 fastest growing economies worldwide. We're being beaten by Poland! And we're not even the fastest growing G20 nation, but we are the fastest growing G7 nation for 2014 alone. Our global competitiveness ranking is woeful, we don't even make the innovation list.

This meant it had to borrow £9.4 billion to balance the books, which was broadly in line with market expectation2.  Of this £9.4 billion, £7.6 billion related to the cost of the ""day-to-day"" activities of the public sector (the current budget deficit), while £1.8 billion related to the spending on infrastructure (net investment).  Annual borrowing has generally been falling since the peak in the financial year ending March 2010. So far this financial year, the public sector has borrowed £25.1 billion. This is £6.1 billion lower than at the same point in the previous financial year.  The Office for Budget Responsibility, who produces economic and fiscal forecasts for government, expects that the public sector will borrow £69.5 billion during the financial year ending March 2016.  Income and Spending by Central Government    Central government’s income and spending make the largest contribution to the amount borrowed by the public sector. Central government received £46.9 billion in income in June 2015. This is around 4% higher than in the same month last year, largely due to receiving higher amounts of VAT, national insurance contributions and income tax this year, compared to last.  Central government spent £58.1 billion, in June 2015, again around a 4% increase compared to the previous year. Of this amount, roughly half was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence) and around a quarter on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, child benefit and maternity pay).  Debt    The amount of money owed by the government to the private sector stood at £1.5 trillion at the end of June 2015, which equates to 81.5% of value of all the goods and services currently produced by the UK economy in a year (or gross domestic product).  Debt has been built up by successive government administrations over many years. When the government borrows, this adds to the debt total.  Public sector debt increased rapidly following the banking crisis in the financial year ending March 2008  UK public sector debt, March 1998 to June 2015"

unitedkingdom,3dymdx,NoTimeToBeSerious,7,Tue Jul 21 11:25:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with the main gist and think we should have some form of proportional representation.   However the statement ""A majority of the country believes that 37% of the vote should not give a party control of parliament. "" is flawed.  Unless you have a source.   Many people would probably agree that the party with the most votes should have the most control, and there are a lot of people in the UK that do not like coalitions. They just want the spread of MPs in the opposition to better reflect the outcome of the popular vote.  Basically, I agree with the idea for a referendum, but would prefer to sign a petition that does not pre-suppose the result of that referendum.  EDIT - also I agree, a straightforward vote on PR is better. Having two referendums, one with multiple options would just result in confusion, and (ironically) FPTP would probably win as all the alternative options split the votes for 'change' between themselves."
unitedkingdom,3dymdx,dobr_person,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Your edit seems backwards. Having two referendums is what allows you to have a straightforward vote on PR vs FPTP. If you just had one referendum, you'd have to include FPTP with the different forms of PR and that's when you get the different options splitting the votes.  The whole point of having two referendums is so you avoid having FPTP vs split votes."
unitedkingdom,3dymdx,Vancha,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:34 2015 UTC,"The issue is the there isn't really such a thing as the ""proportional representation"" system.  PR is more a classification of voting system.  The two systems most associated with the name, closed- and open-list PR are actually fairly different in terms of operation, and both have a lot of negative qualities.   Closed-list basically means that there is not control over the order that candidates will be elected.  This is what happens when electing MEPs.  People vote for a party, that party decides which MPs are elected.  This is, in my opinion, a terrible way to run an election, because it means we have no control over who is elected, and MPs can stay in power for as long as they like, without being answerable to the general public.  There are ways around this (votes of no confidence etc) but working out how to make sure it's not too easy or too hard to remove an MP is a hard problem.  Open-list PR allows the electorate to simultaneously vote for individual MPs as well, where different forms of open-list PR assign different weights to the public vote.  The issue here is, with a parliament of a few hundred seats, most people don't know who each candidate is, what they have done, and why they should or shouldn't vote for them.  Voting is done positively, so it's impossible to ""unvote"" bad or notorious candidates, while simultaneously being difficult for new, public-favoured candidates to be elected without a huge groundswell of support.  Neither of these systems seems at all good to me.  The fact that they produce perfectly proportional parliaments seems of little use when the elected MPs aren't held accountable to anyone."
unitedkingdom,3dymdx,MrJohz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:02:23 2015 UTC,"Most associated in what way? When people talk about PR, it tends to be assumed that they're talking about either STV or MMP, since they're both infinitely more popular than a straight-up party list PR."

unitedkingdom,3dymdx,NoTimeToBeSerious,13,Tue Jul 21 08:29:07 2015 UTC,"Because the New Zealand format is a variant of proportional representation. It is fundamentally different to FPTP, which AV wasn't. Many parties and groups opposed AV because they felt it was in no way a step forward from FPTP."
unitedkingdom,3dymdx,nmcconville,5,Mon Jul 20 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"The country voted to keep FPTP over AV+ (as per the question).  With regard to AV+, Nick Clegg himself described it as a ""miserable little compromise"". I don't think anyone seriously wanted AV+ aside from a platform for transitioning to a different, more proportional system. All I truly know is that it lost, I don't know 'why' it lost.  With the outcome of the recent election, attitudes may have shifted (of course, they may have not).  Using a NZ style approach then the electorate would be able to definitively reject or accept FPTP.   I see one of the silver bullets to the shifting away from this voting system is the inability to agree upon the final system - STV being too complicated was recently provided as a reason to omit Amendment 47 from the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill, for example. That settled that, apparently. I like STV, but I accept that it has drawbacks when considering something like - say, the constituent-representative link. However, I don't think it makes sense that we have a PR six-shooter loaded with referenda for every system. I would prefer a systematic approach towards PR, where different systems could actually be debated.    Time, effort, and money will be spent on a multitude of issues, we could have referenda on other issues, and we could fund other things as well. Prioritization is a complex task considering the plate of issues that exist. David Mitchell put this point across quite bluntly when he was criticizing the over-the-top No2AV campaign posters.  I don't think it would be anti-democratic, the NZ approach would be asking a different question, not necessarily disrespecting a previously asked one. If there is a significant (if you can define it) demand for something like this then why shouldn't it happen again? Attitudes aren't set in stone and while it may be premature for another referendum on this issue, this is no reason to keep campaigning for another referendum on the matter later.  What I do know is that FPTP is an unfair, unrepresentative system. It is inadequate to represent nationally held views. It continues to satisfy Duverger's Law - as Lord Ashdown said on Question Time, the coalitions are within the parties. The current Labour leadership election seems to me to highlight how weird this can make the political parties."
unitedkingdom,3dymdx,NoTimeToBeSerious,4,Mon Jul 20 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"My problem is that the people who bothered to vote against AV, who campaigned against it, who argues against it, who dedicated hours of their life, often unpaid, deserve a reward for doing so.   They deserve a reward for winning in a referendum which provided basically no positive outcome for the reformists?   You entirely undermine the democratic process when a referendum is between 'wonderful change' and 'a small period of the status quo until the other side find a different voting system they like to trigger another referendum'.   Yet you don't question the democratic nature of offering a choice between a plurality system and another plurality system and then wondering why the reformists didn't show up to vote?   The electoral reform side lost, and so they deserve to be punished. No referendums for them for the foreseeable future.   Wow. Yes, let's punish the reformists for the Tories giving them a choice between the same shit and the same shit but with a few sprinkles here and there. ""Hey guys, yeah, we won that fair and square, now fuck off because you OBVIOUSLY LOST IN WHAT YOU TOTALLY WANTED TO DO"".   If they want to have another referendum, they should have to pay for the No side to do it, in full.   Ha ha ha. I don't know if you're being serious, but in case you are, the No side (primarily the Tories) was the reason the reformists got shafted in the first place. If anyone should be compensating anyone, it's the No side compensating the reformists for the utter waste of time that the AV referendum was."

AV+ is not a proportional system. It is not the system people are campaigning for now.  Why should people have to pay the No2AV side whenever they're not advocating for AV? That seems to be silly.   'a small period of the status quo until the other side find a different voting system they like to trigger another referendum'   In my comment I advocate against this, the NZ approach does not directly advocate for this. It is about rejection of a broken system.  Punished is probably a bit harsh. And what is 'the foreseeable future'? Is it the next government after this? Do we have a 'metarendum' to decide if it's worth tabling? Will it be a decade, in 2021? Or should we wait another 80 years?  I think the period of time we are in is one for improving public understanding of what the alternatives are. Renegotiation and consultation are key, and can effect change in the outcome.  It is clear that the democratic process is undermined when we make absolute of all votes cast down, to make irrelevant of results of discussion and improvement. I imagine the next future vote on this issue will not be for something like AV+, which is what the public rejected."
unitedkingdom,3dymdx,nmcconville,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Their reward for voting against AV+ was the non-introduction of AV+.  The majority of electoral reformists never wanted this** (see the next paragraph).

It is not one unified camp***, some support MMS, some support STV, yes, some reformists support AV(+). Support in 2011 came only begrudgingly, it was what was put on the table.  I'm for having weight to results in the form of longevity. Although to advocate otherwise, why should popular support in parliament (and noting that the elected government is the body which instates these referenda) for something materially (of which, PR is) different to AV+ be quenched on such an arbitrary number?  ** Electoral system. *** Although, unified in their rejection of FPTP."

By ""literally nothing"" you mean ""5 years of their preferred system"", right?   Yes side lose literally nothing other than having to find a different system they like.   The reformists and the Yes side don't overlap as much as you think.   Off the top of my head? 20 years should do it. And that should be codified for the next one, so that people know when they are voting and campaigning for no they get at least 20 years as a result.   5 years, methinks.

A tiny number of people voting for a stupid reason doesn't invalidate the result.   No, it shows that the electorate would rather keep FPTP than reform to AV. It doesn't show that the electorate prefers FPTP.   I spent a lot of time following the AV referendum. It took up a lot of time, effort and money for a lot of people, and the people said no. Decisively.   No, 68% of 42% of the electorate said no. That's an abysmal voter turnout which was probably caused by being given a choice between two practically identical voting systems.   The electoral reform side don't get to just write that off just because they lost and would have prefered the referendum to have been on a different subject.

Oh, the New Zealand system was always crap, we always wanted this other very slightly different system. Ignore all of the people who said different before...   Oh yes, that's a great argument. ""What, you don't think being given a choice between two plurality systems was acceptable? Next you'll tell me that the thing you actually wanted in the first place wasn't acceptable too!

At the moment, a small party gets some seats and exactly zero percent of the power in the UK. With the NZ system, because more coalitions are made, small parties get to make some headway on their main wishes (due to agreements for support), while not actually being in power.

With that in mind, we would be better off having immigrants from the ""good"" areas (EU15, India) than the ""bad"" ones (Pakistan & Bangladesh, EU A10).   Visa regulations are normally set on a country-by-country basis so (ignoring the EU question) it would be possible for the government to tweak immigration policy to only allow in certain countries. Seems a bit of a backward and reactive way to set policy to me though (""We've had some great Australians in recently, see if there are any more available"")."

US elections are probably open to much more criticism, if not for being rigged, for being bought.  The fact that you say he was a dictator shows that you have already completely bought in to the Western anti-progressive propaganda which always kicks into high gear when a country goes off the accepted global capitalist rails.  Every left wing leader in the global south has had to face it, no matter how democratic and how open and free they tried to keep heir society.  (Too free of course, and the US secret services would just turn it over).  Third.  More objective outside observers didn't think it was a conspiracy theory.  Forth. In actual fact the coup was plotted by a few isolated right wing military types with the support of a small class of wealthy Venezuelans, based on a staged shooting incident at a public demonstration against the government.

And although the majority of left wing protestors protest within the law, a minority of them do have extreme left wing views, and do commit crimes, such as trespassing on airport runways, trespassing on nuclear power stations, interfering with fracking, defending evictions etc, all of which are crimes that the police must at least attempt to prevent, without taking politics into consideration."
unitedkingdom,3dy1p7,jonpv,12,Mon Jul 20 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"This depends on your view of whether law or common morality is more important. I would say that crimes like theft and murder definitely must be met with punishment, for example, but 'crimes' such as fucking defending evictions are simply exercises of freedom. The law in this case is wrong."
unitedkingdom,3dy1p7,MOAR_cake,19,Mon Jul 20 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"This depends on your view of whether law or common morality is more important.   But that's exactly what every extremist would say... It's not like terrorists aren't aware of the law, they simply think that their view their ""morality"" is higher and gives them the right to violate laws. Sure, Occupy is far from being Al-Qaida but Europe does have a history of left wing terrorism. E.g. the whole RAF movement actually started out pretty similarly to the Occupy movement with students protesting against bankers and big firms and relatively minor violations of laws. Then someone started with ""it's okay, as long as nobody gets hurt"", then people got hurt, then it ended in full scale terrorism.  So the police putting Occupy in a terror presentation is a problem but Occupy breaking laws isn't? Also this article is from The Guardian, so it's probably taken out of context or at least they are intentionally making the police look bad just because that's the political agenda of the newspaper. E.g. on the slide it says ""terrorism and domestic issues"". Not equals. The police even explains that:   A section of the presentation mentions protest groups. This is not an attempt to label them as terrorists, but an opportunity to discuss other policing issues that could affect educational establishments in the Square Mile."
unitedkingdom,3dy1p7,whitepalms85,4,Mon Jul 20 18:33:23 2015 UTC,"So the police putting Occupy in a terror presentation is a problem but Occupy breaking laws isn't?   Out of curiosity, which laws did Occupy break?  Although from what I remember of Occupy, part of what they were taking issue with was how little influence 'normal' people (however you define that) have in what is and isn't illegal. Obviously trying to take on banks, arranging a demonstration on what turns out to be private property, in the only place in the UK where those banks etc. get allocated votes in the local government elections, and where that local government has direct control over the police force was a fairly silly idea in hindsight..."

The City of Westminster, later becoming London, was built next to it and surrounded it. Both of them have separate local governments and the CoL gets many privileges nowhere else in the UK gets. The CoL gets to send an advocate into Parliament called the Remembrancer who ensures that any laws passed that would affect the CoL in a way it doesn't like contains an exception for them. Their local government is voted for primarily by the leftovers of medieval guilds and modern corporations that do business there, residents actually have a minority of the votes.  I thought it worth clarifying that I am not some conspiracy nut who thinks corporations secretly rule London and the rest of the UK but am actually serious when I say that corporations rule a small but influential part of the UK, even to the point of being able to challenge parliament."

This was never likely to pass the courts, but nonetheless the state has run up a hefty legal bill on the taxpayers' behalf trying unsuccessfully to get it through - probably in the order of some hundreds of thousands of pounds.   Isn't parliament, you know, sovereign? If Parliament passes a law which says   It's now legal to copy or rip CDs for private use. No compensation needs to be paid to rights owners. Where there is any conflict, this law supersedes all other laws or precedents that might otherwise be relevant in this case.   then that would seem to be the end of the matter. As soon as Her Majesty signs it, that's it. Sorted.  The point is that courts impose the law passed by parliament. It's not up to the courts to decide whether they like a law or not."

Me and my mates went H.A.M on Pen-y-Ghent and we were still feeling it by the last peak.  Pack as light as you can. I carried a whole load of kit that I didn't use, in a rucksack that wasn't made for walking. It really made a lot of the climbing harder than it should have been.

Seriously it's ridiculous, petitions work well when they don't have a strong counter-argument, i.e. the Hillsborough disaster inquiry. Petitions work badly when you can't gauge the opposition, i.e. a petition for a politician to be removed from a ministerial role.   Honestly, it would be like having an anti-austerity petition. 100,000 signatures might sound great but seeing as you don't know how the other 60 odd million people in this country feel about it from that then it wouldn't be a suitable topic for debate."

Why should the commons debate a matter that concerns the whole country after 0.15% of the people sign a petition for it?    How can you call that a democracy? They're not going to answer (nor should they) because a democracy shouldn't operate in this way. 0.15% public disapproval (currently 0.1%) shouldn't be allowed to initiate a vote of no confidence.    Petitions are not supposed to be used in this way.

Then we can start addressing the root cause of the fatalities."

unitedkingdom,3e1y6p,sionnach,3,Tue Jul 21 12:44:47 2015 UTC,"Japan has an interesting method - it's a very big fine (over a million Sterling equivalent, I think) if you kill yourself by jumping under a train.  It's large enough that if you're going to kill yourself, you won't do it by train and cause all that disruption and leave your family with a huge debt.  It also saves the poor driver of the train an awful lot of trauma.  It sounds very cold and calculated, but it's not a bad policy really."
unitedkingdom,3e1y6p,sionnach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:23 2015 UTC,you won't do it by train and cause all that disruption and leave your family with a huge debt.   See that is the problem right there. It doesn't reduce suicide. It just moves it away from one method to another. Is bankrupting a traumatised family worth it?  As a person who thinks this is a good and decent country. I hope nothing like that ever happens here.
unitedkingdom,3e1y6p,sharklazers99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"Is bankrupting a traumatised family worth it?   No, but it's unclear how much the families have to actually pay. The threat of it is enough to deter the action.  Killing yourself on a train line is incredibly selfish. It costs serious money to deal with, and inconveniences huge groups of people who now miss their flight / business meeting / wedding / funeral because of the actions of an individual.   Similarly, putting barriers up on a train platform won't stop someone killing themselves by your reasoning - it will just make them do it another way. It's a lot cheaper, and pretty much as effective to put in place the fine policy. Can you imagine how much it would cost to put up platform doors on every platform in the country!?"
unitedkingdom,3e1y6p,sionnach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:23 2015 UTC,It is an inhumane policy and I would not wish that on anybody. Besides the immorality of it there are also practical issues -  Why should the family be responsible for the death of someone they may not have seen for decades? What is family anyway?   If a boyfriend drives a person to commit suicide through abuse and then the parents get a massive fine and lose their child what the hell is good about that? And not everybody will be thinking fully rationally when they commit suicide so it might not deter them anyway. It is madness.
unitedkingdom,3e1y6p,justthisplease,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:06 2015 UTC,"It does seem to have deterred it in Japan. It's highly unusual for someone to kill themselves in this way. Hanging is, by far, their preferred method."

On what arguments do you base your prediction that next economic crisis is coming in less than a year?  Everything that appears to be going well is doing so on the basis of such a massive injection of liquidity without providing any real growth. This is the biggest stimulus package which has ever existed. It was not used as a Keynesian stimulus package, but for buying up toxic debt, and it has even not been able to get 0.5% growth.  Now there is an even bigger debt bubble than in 2007–8, and the banks are even more concentrated than before the crash. If you look at the US stock market, you will see that firms are borrowing money in order to buy their own shares to maintain the prices, and not investing in the real economy. Unemployment is increasing, at least in terms of real jobs rather than pseudo-jobs. The European economy is not really recovering, and there are also difficulties in China.  These three areas amount to 60 percent or more of the world economy — and if each of them is fragile, it is plausible to conclude that we will have a new crisis.   Good overall analysis of the Cameron government and the problems facing Labour."

Just work 2 days a week for your £40K and sit around watching TV for the other 5, this just creates massive inefficiency in the economy. It is far better to make these menial workers to go on a training course and become plumbers, or office workers, or whatever relatively skilled trade that they are perfectly capable of doing given the inclination to do it, one of those inclinations being market forces paying these roles a living wage. Of course this means that training courses, paid training courses, should be available to make this possible and economically favourable for the person.     Extra cash on top of what?

I really isn't hard to get training to get a job that pays £7-9 an hour right now, if you actually have the inclination to do so, over paying people to do menial jobs just removes one of the incentives to do so.

I don't know if you've ever tried to live on the bare minimum, but it's pretty fucking motivating to get out of it.   No it is over paying, a monkey could do these jobs, they shouldn't pay well so people aspire to their potential getting paid training to do something economically efficient. The irony being is as soon as you start over paying people for monkey work the sooner large companies invest in automated systems to replace and remove those jobs from the market as it will be economically viable to do so. Advanced automated systems cost a lot of money, if you make humans cost more, it makes the automated systems costs oh so marginally different, all while being more efficient than humans in the first place.

No, it's the bare minimum need to survive without becoming a massive drain on society through benefits and other government assistance (which are now also being slashed so your double fucked).   Well proof that isn't true is people living off the minimum wage in the south of England, all with 30% cost of living increases over people in the north of England, so either the minimum wage is 30% more than you need to pay in the cheaper areas of the north, or everyone on the minimum wage in the south is starving of the streets, which they aren't, it is no great life style and I would suggest that £7.85 really is the minimum living wage for a decent standard of living in the south. But facts of it are the minimum wage is barely sustainable in the south, it is sustainable with a poor standard of living, but £6.50 is easily a living wage in the north already, as it is the equivalent of someone living off £5 a hour or less in the south, which people manage, not well, but they do it. So why are we artificially inflating the minimum wage in areas of the country where the currently minimum wage is already a living wage? Treating a country with vastly different costs of living, rent can literally go up by 100% between places in the north and the south, in the same manner is just ridiculous, if you want a living wage work it out by actual cost of living of an area, because that is exactly what happens when you get to a true market equilibrium, costs change depending on the cost of living, you won't get the same pay rate in Leeds as you do in Brighton."

unitedkingdom,3dx2wj,gazzthompson,-5,Tue Jul 21 09:00:56 2015 UTC,"The government should not be partially subsiding an inefficient firms profits by topping up via benefits the wages for a low productivity job.   Why does the government have to subsidies anything? They don't.   Not to mention that the government taking money off rich people and giving it to poor people is one way of level the playing field in society, primarily that is always going to be subsiding poor people.   The other problem with your argument is that is just wrong, plenty of college students do part time jobs for extra cash, they aren't living off them, plenty of stay at home parents do a job a couple of days a week for some extra cash, they aren't living off it, they are living off their partners wage.   These jobs have no need to pay a living wage. The other rather entertaining thing about your premise is the solution isn't to pay people more, it is to automate the the jobs and completely remove the job from the pool, which is all well and good until there literally aren't enough jobs to go around, not everyone is smart enough to code the systems or work as techs for them.    Think of the living wage as a way for the goverment to force companies to invest in productivity boosting measures, benefting the economy in the long run.   That is a perfectly reasonable perspective, until you take into account boosting productivity means removing the job from the pool completely, and these people inherently aren't trained to do anything else, or they would be and be getting paid more, and unskilled jobs will get less and less available as automation increases, especially if you are creating market inefficiencies by over paying them.   Wait until driverless vehicles turn up, then they'll all br screwed and be wishing they could go back to the low minimum wage just to be hired in a job which is now taken by the more efficient automated vehicles. The economy isn't suddenly going to sprout 20% more essentially unskilled jobs when driving no longer becomes a necessary skill, but the less you pay them the less incentive there is to do that, especially if what you are paying them is way above the true market equilibrium point."

Now lets take the other premise, companies pay more, now rich people don't give money to poor people, companies give money to poor people, yay! Companies which then raise their prices to maintain profit margins, leading to goods costing more, which mean poor people give more of their money back to those companies every time they buy anything, so inflation increases, and the living wage increase get munched up by these inflation increases, all while paying them more means it isn't really worth having them in the first place so they automate the jobs, so less jobs for the unskilled exist, so no jobs for poor people.   Yay! All the problems solved, oh wait no, that isn't what happened at all, all the low skilled jobs just got priced out of the market and no longer exist, at least the economy is more efficient now and the rich no longer have to pay those pesky poor people housing benefit!

Just work 2 days a week for your £40K and sit around watching TV for the other 5, this just creates massive inefficiency in the economy.   Literally no one is arguing that. Or even close. The living wage is approximately £16-17k a year on a full time contract. Are you even bothering to listen or are these strawmans deliberate?"
unitedkingdom,3dx2wj,NanoNarse,-4,Mon Jul 20 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"There is no difference it is just extrapolation, the living wage is most certainly not £16-17K in Sheffield, or many other northern towns and cities, you can rent a room in Sheffield for £50 a week, that means the living wage in somewhere like Brighton where you aren't getting much below £90 is £19.5K, plaining untrue, it is more like exactly the number you are saying, £16-17K in one of the most expensive cities in the UK (London you aren't getting much below £110, another £1000 a year on top).   Facts are you could easily live off £14K in Sheffield, you can live off the current minimum wage, as it is the equivalent £15.5K down south, that is just accounting for rent price differences, add in other costs an it is going to be more like £16K in the south, suddenly your apparent living wage is already in place in the north, or as is actually the case the south is just getting massively low balled and isn't on a living wage at all.   So either your £16-17K figure is absolute BS, as in the south that is the equivalent of minimum wage in Sheffield, or you are proposing massively over inflating the minimum wage in Northern England, you can't have it both ways. So either you don't know what your talking about, or half the country is already on a living wage and the new ""living wage"" is just totally over inflating pay for that half, while not even being a living wage for a good third of the country, i.e. the London commuter belt, also known as the South East."

unitedkingdom,3dx2wj,LE4d,-6,Mon Jul 20 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. Also retail is hardly enraged-customer facing, you can just refer them to customer services, where they inevitable won't go because it is so obvious you don't give a damn about their opinion.   Facts are if you start paying so highly for menial jobs what is the point in spending £50K getting a degree, to work and commute 60 hours a week for a rather negligible difference in pay, far easier to just put your 40 hours in and go home not even having to think about the job again. If you work/commute for 60 hours a week, with £2K a year commute costs (which isn't much), someone on £15K a year doing 37.5 hours a week with no commute cost and a 15 minute commute ends up on the same money per hour as someone on £28972 after tax and for every extra thousand in commute costs they have to be making £1470 extra to make it back, for £3K a year commute costs that is over £30K a year. This is all assuming they didn't get a degree to get this professional job, at which point they are paying another 9% of their money above £21K meaning the amount to break even per hour is even higher and there are plenty of people who put in 60 hour weeks including their commute.   There will still be shit jobs out there by definition that people don't want to do, but people shouldn't be sticking around in shit jobs because it pays too well to be bothered to leave, unless it is a high skilled shit job that has been priced that way due to market forces.   Then again what this will most likely mean is large retailers just start 0 hour temping more 16-22 year olds never putting them on a decent contract so if they do stick around for 2-7 years they have either moved up the ladder to be worth that pay or they just cut their hours in favour of a cheaper labour monkey. It really has no effect on businesses at all and actually serves my very point, plenty of competent 20-24 year olds out there.   I know Tesco just got rid of the 1.5x pay rate of Sunday for new members of staff, and members who have been there a long time get 2x pay, though in the end that just means the management won't let them come in on those days as it costs too much. Which was my point in the first place."

In the 14 months I've been in this office I have seen no less than 30 people come and go (the office only employs 40 or so). The GlassDoor reviews all mention the low base salary and rubbish commission, and I overheard a senior HR lady the other week on the phone say how each new starter costs the company roughly £5,000. So I seriously question why a lot of organisation don't understand that higher salaries actually would lead to happier staff, harder workers and overall more productivity... I am leaving in 2 weeks because guess what, the salary is shit for the work I do. But if I was paid another £3k or so I would definitely reconsider. Now they will spend £5k hiring my replacement who probably won't do the job as well as me (at least for the first few months). Large companies should all consider paying the lower employees more."

Now, Ikea might yet pay more than that, but the problem is that the article's wording is wildly unclear, as the terms 'living wage' and 'national living wage' are used interchangeably.

The costs involved with hiring and training new staff must be huge and could offset any savings they make with a lower hourly rate. So this could be as much a business decision as an ethical one.   All anecdotal, but I used to work in a call centre (which was fucking horrific), they paid minimum wage and had very strict working conditions. Everything was monitored, from toilet breaks to lunchtimes - you had to be exactly 30 minutes from logging out to logging back in and taking a call. Call times, call notes, everything was overbearingly monitored. With the best will in the world, they just didn't pay people enough who were either good enough (it was tech desk) or willing to put up with that, as soon as people could leave they did immediately. So they would have a new influx every few weeks who were trained for two weeks (paid) then who were pretty terrible for at least the first month until they learnt the ropes. They may have had less than 10 minutes in the toilet each day but they couldn't sort out a customer's broadband connection! The cycle then repeated, many dropped out after a week, or even just after training.   Then compare to another job where they had a round of redundancies including a twat of a manager also obsessed with stats and targets. The core of the staff left had a pay increase and were given more responsibilites and a yearly bonus. No one left, they were all very loyal from then on."

I did feel a bit bad for him.. until I found out he gets benefits. £144 every two weeks, so a tenner per day. Once he told me that it just pissed me off. People get help, and then just piss it all down the drain.  And one of his friends lets him stay over sometimes, as long as he brings her a drink. I've taken him there a few times and been in twice. She's on various benefits, hundreds of pounds worth, a paid for flat. It's in a complete state. All her money goes on alcohol, crack, and heroin.

It will make you look less callous.    a lot of these people fritter away their money on alcohol etc.    'A lot' is a pretty vague target.

Just go to any of the shitty estates and you'll see plenty of people sitting around drinking lager and smoking roll ups   I'll see 'plenty' of people drinking lager and smoking roll ups, will I?  Again, there's nothing here that's factual. How many people 'smoke roll ups' or drink 'lager' in these 'shitty estates' and what percentage of their income is being spent?   Or maybe those statistics don't matter to you. Maybe you'd rather go with your gut.   Those habits can be fairly expensive,    Pretty ambiguous words here. How expensive is 'fairly' expensive. Again - how many people are spending what you feel is a disproportionate sum of money on these items. How much money would they save if they stopped? Would that be enough to solve their financial problems?  Or do you not know? Are you just guessing?   so I have little sympathy.   Well, that's fairly clear.

How much are cigs these days? 7 quid? Little sympathy for their self imposed escapable situation.   You have little sympathy for kids who do not have enough food to eat?   Because you have decided that 'plenty' of their parents are not managing their money effectively.  Ok, well, that's one point of view I guess.  Let's pretend you DID care about these kids - consider it a thought experiment, I don't actually expect you to generate the human empathy required to ACTUALLY care about them...

unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,TumblingBumbleBee,5,Mon Jul 20 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading through the Citizen's Advice advice pages before you ring - it'll help your assessor no end if you can say ""I already read your page on PIP/ESA"" because they shouldn't have to repeat the information there.   Some Bureau's have the ability to put you in touch with specialist organisations that can help, but I don't know how helpful the Bureau themselves can be. Did you want to appeal the ESA decision? I think they have advisors to help with the appeals if necessary EDIT: Benefits appeals advice CAB link"
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,toomanyairmiles,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:35 2015 UTC,It may be worth giving your Uni's disability unit a call too. They often know how to flex the system and get you the support you need.
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,teafaceisming,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:51:48 2015 UTC,The CAB can take up to 6 weeks to get you an appointment.
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,toomanyairmiles,11,Mon Jul 20 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"To give you insight on how the process in my local CAB works, client comes to the reception, they see the gateway assessor that day, usually within 1-3 hours. It is first come first serve. The assessor takes all of your information and speaks to the Advice Session Supervisor.   Depending on the situation and what ticket you have will decide how long the appointment will be. You might be given the information you need to do it yourself or signposted to an organisation specialised with what you require there and then.  If someone is Homeless or has no income or is about to be evicted you will be seen that day or at least given a food voucher and told where to go if it is simply physically impossible to fit you in.   If you have a deadline we will try to fit you in good time before the hand in date. If it is a welfare sanction or appeal or anything like that there will also be quite a priority given and at least in Derby an advocacy project that deals only with clients with health conditions that need more basic help.  With utility arguments, consumer disputes things like that it will often be assessed how capable you are of sorting out the issues yourself. Health conditions, language barriers, literacy issues often are the decidors. Or if the case is quite complex and you genuinely require help.  Similarly most CABs have internal services like a Debt Management team, some form of Employment support and maybe local legal bodies giving limited free advice on specialised subjects like eviction or immigration which may very well be able to get you an appointment very quickly.  It is also worth noting that benefits changes have really upped the footfall in CABs. They are inundated with sanctions, EEA citizens hit by habitual residency laws and tax problems, because getting rid of the tax offices without having a decent call centre structure in place was a bad idea. Whereas CAB funding has fell and students and older volunteers are more often than not working or in work placements or struggling themselves with the job centre etc. The shift for all benefits moving online has had a big impact because soooo many people are computer illiterate and Councils and Job Centres give 0 help on site with computers. Seriously it is mad. It is expected that Universal Credit will draw everyone out as then everyones benefits will shift over and they will have to deal with online claims. Legal Aid also was a massive hit and most people simply can't afford legal advice/representation and they see the CAB as the next best thing.  TL;DR the CAB is under so much stress at the moment and things are just getting worst. However if you have an emergency you will most likely be seen on the day, helped or squeezed in ASAP. If you have a minor consumer issue or no mental health etc. that might impede you then it may take longer.  Source: work at the CAB.  note: all CABs are seperate charities but share basic organisational structures"

I live in London, and although my issue was an emergency, I was offered an appointment six weeks hence (which would have rendered any advice useless) and told this is typical in major cities due to lack of trained staff.   I have heard similar stories from other people and had a very similar experience 20 odd years back.  I was eventually able to obtain advice through the Martin Lewis site which led me to a fourth sector charity which was able to advise me over the phone."
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,Skilbride,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:12 2015 UTC,"Ah that sucks, I suppose I can only really speak for the local CAB. Although I have been to training with other bureau across the midlands which seem to all operate in the same way, but a lot have been struggling lately as each one is independently funded and needs to bid on its own for funding. 6 weeks is ridiculous though, our target is to see every client within 2 weeks at the very latest as the DNA (did not attend) rate is too high past that. I honestly feel guilty not giving a lot of clients appointments on the day. The volunteers have gotten wise to my 'easy client' requests :P"

They literally don't have enough trained advisors to cope with demand and, no matter the urgency of the situation, that means getting from contact to information takes up to six weeks even for high priority cases.  Its equally true that the advice they are offering is no different than that offered by other, more accessible, fourth sector organisations. Hence my advice to this chap that he explores other organisations that are better resourced while waiting for the CAB."

unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,teafaceisming,11,Mon Jul 20 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"First thing would be to contact your local CAB or similar such oprganisation, the whole benefits system is a minefield designed not to help youi but to try and limit the number of claimants.   You have 28 days to lodge an appeal on any decision made by the DWP so you need to get in touch with people who understand the system and will knoiw if you actually have grounds for appeal before that time runs out."
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,reflectionofabutt,4,Mon Jul 20 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"I've made an appeal but it seems likely to be unsuccessful from what my assessor said (she read out the regulations she used to make the decision, and I think she complied with them pretty well). I'm going to call CAB first thing tomorrow :)"
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,LeMoofinateur,4,Mon Jul 20 14:29:27 2015 UTC,"It is very hard to 'tick the boxes' exactly with most conditions, the privatised medical assesments are almost a theatre before the real assesment when you go to your tribunal. In the tribunal you will have a medical assessor and a judge and there they tend to do a much more thorough job!  I work in the local CAB and I would highly recommend going down ASAP. You have to remember that they are all volunteers but the Advice Session Supervisor will always be looking through what is going on and will be on the ball. They will help you formalise your appeal in the context of the expanded criteria (what is written on the assessment sheets doesn't completely match their marked criteria - see the disability rights handbook 2015 edition if you can find it).   Likely they will know who could go with you for representation if you need it and would probably be able to send an advocate to give you a pep talk before you go in, make sure everything is done by the book and a bit of moral support. At the very least a second opinion is always nice.  On that note, I hate the system that is in place, guilty until proven innocent pretty much. The amount of people who would want to 'scrounge' on ESA all of their lives is very small. Most disabled people don't want to be on ESA!   They must be losing much, much more money on the private medical assessments and then tribunals which take place, judges aren't cheap and all the centres are staffed with G4S security. Which to me is quite frankly illogical."

unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,orwellsocietyguy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"You've mentioned that under current conditions you would not be able to return to study because you're too ill, it could therefore be argued that currently you are not planning to return to university (You simply have the option should your circumstances change), would that make a difference as to whether you qualify for ESA?"
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,orwellsocietyguy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so right now I'm too sick to study. The hope is that the chemo will work eventually, and if not then maybe surgery will improve things, and I'll be able to return to studying next January. However, the person who assessed my ESA claim told me that in order to qualify, I would have to cut all ties with the university. In other words, I would have to quit my degree in order to get anything in terms of ESA. I don't see this as a viable option, given I've invested a lot of time and effort into my degree already, and there's a good chance I'll be able to return come January."

I was in a fairly similar situation a year or so ago when I was diagnosed with leukaemia and had to defer my final year of university for treatment. I applied for ESA and received it a couple of months later and it was back dated from the date I applied. You have to treat the whole thing like you are no longer a student. I have no idea why it was declined in the first place but you should ring them up and make it very clear you are unemployed and are not a student.  Good luck!
unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,PrincessGary,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:30 2015 UTC,Yep I had a similar situation and receiving ESA at the higher rate (mistakenly) when I suspended my studies. You should 100% be entitled to full ESA while you are not studying.

unitedkingdom,3dy2uc,Nultaar,4,Mon Jul 20 18:03:17 2015 UTC,Are you going to go through the appeals process? It takes the absolute piss but if you are able I would advise starting it and sending in a letter from yourself explaining the situation and how it is ridiculous as well as getting a letter from your university explaining how you will not be attending the university in any capacity until January contingent on your good health. This might get turned down at the first appeals stage but when it gets sent to the independent tribunal they seem to be a lot more common sensed as opposed to mindless bureaucracy.   Also look into the exceptional circumstances rule which says that if being found fit for work would be a risk to your health or well being then you should not be found fit for work.   You've essentially been kicked out on a technicality that has little to do with the real situation you are in and it should not stand. I know you're getting bombarded with advice so I hope it comes across as helpful and informative and not just nagging of what you should do.

You will not be helping yourself by describing yourself to any functionary as a student, when the Student finance people do not think you are able to get money from them.

It would have been very fragile.  The Liberal Democrats were also worried about the perception that it was a 'coalition of the losers' although they knew that isn't how our system works.
unitedkingdom,3e2dtb,Sir_Bantersaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:39 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons, quite a few of which seem to boil down to personality conflicts involving some of the key players on both sides, but I think the key reason is this:   the electoral arithmetic meant that there would be no Lib Dem-Labour majority in the House of Commons. So any Lib-Lab coalition would have had to rely on the other parties - the DUP and the other Irish parties, a Green, and possibly the Nationalists - in order to stay in power. That would be challenging at the best of times, but having to hold together such a government while taking tough decisions on deficit reduction (necessary under any gov­ernment) would have been extraordinarily difficult.

unitedkingdom,3dzqdq,myatomsareyouratoms,8,Mon Jul 20 21:06:41 2015 UTC,"There's still such a massive stigma around mental health. I honestly believe that dealing with it is one of the biggest challenges the world faces.   It's an odd scenario. In the developed countries our 'real' problems are relatively minor - we have every essential humans need to survive and even those of us living in what we currently define as 'poverty' live far better lives than even just the last couple of generations did.  And yet mental health issues are seemingly increasing. So many of the people I know closely suffer from anxiety and depression and, for those of us who do suffer, life can become a horrible experience. Mental illness is almost like a scar we carry under our clothes that has to remain hidden and which is usually only to be revealed to those of us who carry the same marks.  I often wonder why mental health issues are on the rise and I've come to the conclusion that it's mainly due to the 21st century, materialistic, always on world we live in today. There is now so much pressure on individuals to conform that it's almost crippling us. We can never switch off and our lives are permanently catalogued online on sites like Facebook. We're permanently up for judgement.  At work, the introduction of email has meant that jobs now arrive instantly and it's easy to become over-faced. We also spend large swathes of our time sat at computers and trapped in air conditioned offices.  Finally, many of us do not see the actual fruits of our labour. We see no material reward for our efforts other than our pay packet and, consequently, we view our success on how large that pay packet is, sometimes chucking away our more human elements in its pursuit.   In light of those facts, it's understandable that many of us struggle. We just can't fit the mould that society expects us to. I sometimes wonder if we're actually mentally ill, or we're perhaps quite rational in seeing the world through the lens we do.  This has been a bit of a rant, so I'll close it with two quotes, one is one of the more powerful lyrics I've heard, and which I think of whenever I see those around me living their life to climb the greasy pole, and the other is from Con Air of all things (and spoken by a serial killer!).  'It's like we weren't made for this world, though I wouldn't really want to meet someone who was.'  'What if I told you insane was working a 50-hour week for 50 years, at the end of which they tell you to piss off. Ending up in some retirement village, hoping to die rather than suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time. Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?'  A-thank you very much."

unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Possiblyreef,-9,Mon Jul 20 16:27:17 2015 UTC,I can't imagine getting your fanny flaps posted on the internet is quite as bad as getting a knife stuck in you. Must have been pretty horrific for the the poor girl to google her name and see it all though.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Rastaa,8,Mon Jul 20 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"If you are stabbed and killed, you don't really have to deal with that, that's a problem for people who are still alive. But if pornography of you is posted online, that can come back to haunt you for the rest of your life, which could be 80 years or so.   So technically, being stabbed and killed is less of a problem for the victim than having naked pictures/videos leaked online."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Ivashkin,0,Mon Jul 20 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"So if someone said to you either post naked photos of yourself or I'll stab you, you'd take the stabbing?"

unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Every_Geth,4,Tue Jul 21 09:16:35 2015 UTC,I've lived here for about 6 years now and I feel the same way.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Hikari-x,8,Mon Jul 20 17:47:05 2015 UTC,What sort of sentence do you think he should get? I can't help but think a prison sentence is wrong for this kind of crime. It's expensive for the state to imprison such people & it may lead to reoffending. I also think it should primarily be violent offenders in prison. Then again I don't think a fine is enough either. Perhaps some court mandated community service too?
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Ewannnn,18,Tue Jul 21 01:16:14 2015 UTC,Community service is the way to go. We should give community service to most non-violent crimes.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,RyJammer,4,Tue Jul 21 02:14:26 2015 UTC,I think this is arguably a violent crime. You can definitely cause serious mental and physical harm to someone without touching them. Posting sexual pictures of someone to their parents is a form of violence as is screaming abuse at a young child or threatening violence to someone.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,TinyZoro,15,Mon Jul 20 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"It isn't. It's an abhorrent crime, but let's not go redefining language. Violent has a specific meaning, and this type of crime is not violent. To use your argument, almost any crime that causes a negative effect to someone could be defined as violent. The word then becomes meaningless."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,start_with_a_song,-9,Mon Jul 20 18:10:23 2015 UTC,Is regularly banging on someone's windows in the middle of the night threatening to kill their children a violent crime? Causing so much distress that the wife is on anti depressants and the kids are withdrawn. Is that less violent than giving someone you know a slap on the back due to the lack of physical contact. Any action that is used to deliberately or recklessly cause someone fear and intimidation I think is an act of violence. Which includes mugging someone with a knife without actually using it.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,TinyZoro,7,Mon Jul 20 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with your argument is that yes, those two cases; threatening to kill someone's children and mugging someone with a knife, are both violent crimes because there is perceived intent of violent activity. This isn't the case when you're posting sexual pictures to someone's parents, unless you're also doing something like threatening to rape them.  Whether or not you agree that community service should be the punishment for most violent crimes, you can't just change the definition of violence."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,elevenbars,-8,Tue Jul 21 07:40:13 2015 UTC,I don't really see a distinction. The intent in both cases is to dominate another person through the use of intense fear. There are many things far more powerful than slapping someone's face to do that. Sending compromising pictures to parents is a form of sexual abuse using shame to attack your victim. That is an act of violence.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,TinyZoro,4,Tue Jul 21 08:00:45 2015 UTC,"Violence, or the threat of violence, involves the concept of physical force against a person. Putting pictures online is a non-physical act. It doesn't even contain a threat of violence.  Revenge porn is a nasty crime, but it is not violent. You cannot redefine words to suit yourself - otherwise effective communication between individuals becomes impossible."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,start_with_a_song,-3,Tue Jul 21 08:17:53 2015 UTC,"No you're wrong. Violence can be emotional, psychological, sexual, forms of neglect, verbal and physical. You're the one attempting to refocus is meaning to just physical.  http://www.gov.nl.ca/VPI/types/"
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,TinyZoro,4,Tue Jul 21 08:27:47 2015 UTC,"I prefer a dictionary for my lexicographical definitions, rather than obscure Canadian websites. But YMMV. You are still wrong, it's just now you're wrong with a Canadian accent.  Anyway, apparently now everything is a violent crime by your definition - that's useful.  Fraud - violent crime. Shoplifting - violent crime.  Am I getting it now?"
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,start_with_a_song,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:49:15 2015 UTC,No but I think of you'd been subject to domestic abuse without physical violence or bullied viciously you would get it.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,TinyZoro,3,Tue Jul 21 09:26:09 2015 UTC,"Again, neither of these are revenge porn. Unless you can point me to a source that says revenge porn is a violent crime and is recorded as such by the police, you are just wrong.  It is really unhelpful to define violent crime in the way you are attempting to, because it turns all crimes in to violent crimes, and the violent aspect loses it's meaning."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,start_with_a_song,2,Tue Jul 21 09:33:54 2015 UTC,"I think one can make the case for serious punishment here without appropriating the word ""violent"" in an somewhat manipulative attempt to increase the perceived severity. You do a disservice to all victims of crime—let alone truly physical violent crime—by this kind of short-term tactic, which will ultimately lead to the evacuation of all real meaning from the word."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,lamby,-8,Tue Jul 21 09:41:09 2015 UTC,Why? How is community service punishment?   In fact how is prison punishment? With the abolition of hard labour in the 1950s I fail to see how it can be considered punishment.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Leetenghui,13,Tue Jul 21 09:44:13 2015 UTC,"Having your freedom taken away and being forced to stick to a strict schedule? Oh and no ability to interact with the opposite sex? Sounds like a walk in the park to me! And community service is a punishment because you have to give up your free time to help the local community. Anyway, justice shouldn't be about punishment, it should about rehabilitation."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,RyJammer,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:25:37 2015 UTC,"Having your freedom taken away and being forced to stick to a strict schedule? Oh and no ability to interact with the opposite sex? Sounds like a walk in the park to me!    Compared to prison systems of other nations. I don't mean the 3rd world either. Japan, Taiwan, S Korea, USA, Singapore tends to treat their prisoners rather poorly.  Read Nick Leeson's accounts of Singaporean prisons. No bed a completely bare cell. Forced labour.   Ollie who I mentioned yesterday spent sometime inside in Japan. He did not cooperate and was put in solitary in the dark for about 5 months.  We do none of this to our prisoners.    Anyway, justice shouldn't be about punishment, it should about rehabilitation.   Except this fails too due to the extreme re offending rate. We should bring back hard labour at the very least digging and filling holes."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Leetenghui,6,Mon Jul 20 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"You want our prisons to run like the USA? Are you crazy? The prisoners run those prisons, mainly gangs segregated by race."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,ktechmidas,0,Mon Jul 20 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"Consider this, we know our current prison system does not work.   So we need to make changes. Since the softly softly approach we've been using doesn't work it's time to start perhaps punishing them more."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Leetenghui,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Our softly approach works far better than the American system, and the nordics seem to do fantastic with their ""holiday camp"" style prison system.  I'd rather not torture our prisoners with cruel and unusual punishments."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,aslate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:25 2015 UTC,I've had a look into this though. The Norway holiday camp system is only for the last 5 years of a sentence not for the whole sentence.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Leetenghui,8,Tue Jul 21 08:55:45 2015 UTC,"We have a high re-offending rate because our prisons focus on punishment rather than rehabilitation. Okay so we're not as bad as America or Japan, but then compare us to Norway, who's prison system is entirely focused on rehabilitation. It may seem cushty, but when there re-offending rate is the lowest in Europe, while ours is over 50 percent you begin to see the issue."
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,RyJammer,-5,Tue Jul 21 09:38:01 2015 UTC,"Remember all those ridiculous Twitter convictions..? This sort of thing is obvious morally abhorrent and the victim is clearly deserving of eye-watering civil damages, but we should be extremely uneasy about any legislation that criminalises ""intent to cause distress"" or suchlike. Whilst we might be convinced in this case, these things have a really nasty habit of, err, expanding their original remit. I hope I won't be linking to this comment in the near future."

unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Barry_Scotts_Cat,3,Mon Jul 20 22:21:37 2015 UTC,There is an obvious victim in this case who has been caused damage. It is not comparable to being mean on Twitter.

unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,start_with_a_song,0,Tue Jul 21 07:42:35 2015 UTC,I'll be charitable and assume you just haven't had your coffee yet. I was comparing legislation that criminalises types of expression—however repugnant—and explaining how they always creep beyond their original and (possibly) virtuous remit. To say I was equating posting nude photos to being mean on Twitter seems almost wilfully dishonest.
unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,lamby,2,Tue Jul 21 09:03:05 2015 UTC,"If you weren't comparing it with being mean on Twitter, then why bring Twitter up at all? To say you weren't intending any comparison is wilfully dishonest. But carry on, and wriggle some more if you like."

unitedkingdom,3dy7ng,Mordisquitos,5,Mon Jul 20 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe because the flavour in many commercial orange juice products isn't from the oranges natural flavour, rather it is added afterwards.  http://civileats.com/2009/05/06/freshly-squeezed-the-truth-about-orange-juice-in-boxes/   The technology of choice at the moment is aseptic storage, which involves stripping the juice of oxygen, a process known as “deaeration,” so it doesn’t oxidize in the million gallon tanks in which it can be kept for upwards of a year.  When the juice is stripped of oxygen it is also stripped of flavor providing chemicals. Juice companies therefore hire flavor and fragrance companies, the same ones that formulate perfumes for Dior and Calvin Klein, to engineer flavor packs to add back to the juice to make it taste fresh."

Children can't consent to sex so this was rape. If I could be bothered I would look for the case where the woman got pregnant by a child then he had to pay child support when he became an adult, as this child may have to do one day.  This issue is primarily about consent, people having children from perhaps casual encounters, not an intention to start a family. Two people really should not have a child unless both parents think it is a good idea. It is a fundamentally selfish act towards the reluctant parent, and the child who will feel unwanted."

Fundamentally, squeezed middle voters do not think that Labour is on their side. Ask who the Party chiefly seems to represent and C1/C2 voters - along with much of the rest of the population - are clear: those on low pay and benefits, and trade unionists.  You cannot accuse the public of missing the point. Under Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, the Labour Party has increasingly defined itself increasingly as being a voice for those on benefits.  Furthermore, in describing a country that is mired in poverty as a result of callous Government cuts, many Labour voices describe a world that does not ring true to C1/C2 voters – people that are not poor but not rich and that carefully watch everything they spend. Clearly poverty exists in this country and the parties have a moral duty to tackle it; that is not the point. The point is that too many people within the wider Labour movement talk as if there was nothing in the country but wealth or extreme poverty.

I don't blame them for seeking reassurance from a real person at a local branch. We' about to lose our Barclays, the only bank left in a town with 8000+ people and growing. Not sure how they think the Post Office is going to cope with taking on the services, local businesses will not be able to put in their daily takings or get change for tills if they have to queue for 45 minutes+... sometimes outside.. far too vulnerable if carrying cash.  Allegedly there was a consultation, seems someone needs to look up what that word means because the news of the closure was just 'BLAM! we're closing this branch, and no one complained or objected to our branch consultation'. Now in a town where the majority are retiree's who can't get to grips with technology.. Hell even I rage at ATMs.. I really don't think the Post Office will cope."

Doing that they cut themselves from future growth and from a pretty good cash printing machine.  I was doing work w/iShares and Barclays at the time. We all scratched our collective heads. Why would you sacrifice the dematerialized portion that makes tons of money and keep the brick-and-mortar business that has serious growth limitations?  This was a hubris play. Payback is a bitch.

unitedkingdom,3e0x64,Maswimelleu,8,Tue Jul 21 10:04:46 2015 UTC,We can. The European Arrest Warrant merged arrest systems so that a person wanted in Luxembourg (for example) can be arrested legally in Britain. That came into force following Liberal Democrat (and wider British) campaigning in the European Parliament. The other country just needs to notify us of the crime and we can initiate a speedy repatriation process. There's certainly no scope for a criminal to evade justice elsewhere in the EU if their residency in the UK is known to the authorities.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23239493

unitedkingdom,3e0x64,Maswimelleu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:21 2015 UTC,"I'd have to check that for you, but my instinct is that their equipment would flag this alongside any other warrant, control order, or watchlist status. The arrest warrant is taken pretty seriously even if the majority of such warrants served do not result in an extradition (possibly because some of the offences are pretty trivial anyway).   Found this here: http://ec.europa.eu/immigration/what-should-i-avoid/how-to-enter-the-eu/crossing-the-eu-borders_en   What happens if an alert shows up for me on the SIS?  Depending on what the alert looks like, you may be refused entry to the country, arrested, moved to a safe place or checked.  For example, if you do not have permission to enter or stay in the EU, you will not be able to cross an EU external border into an EU country. If you are sought for extradition or are the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, you could be arrested. If you are a missing person, you may be brought to a safe place while the authorities in your home country are contacted.  All SIS alerts are processed through a network of national offices in each EU country. These so called SIRENE offices are contact points between officials in the EU country which has created a SIS alert and those in the EU country where the people or objects in question are found"

Why do you think that having a clean criminal record should be required to cross into the UK, but shouldn't be required to cross from (for example) Northern Ireland to England? It's not very clear cut at all, and we've done fine for having criminal records available across the entire UK. Seems odd the suggest that you can't expand that across the entire EU given that they're a collection of countries with broadly as effective criminal justice systems and similar moral values."
unitedkingdom,3e0x64,Maswimelleu,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:38:58 2015 UTC,They are British citizens.
unitedkingdom,3e0x64,Maswimelleu,2,Tue Jul 21 11:40:38 2015 UTC,"But a Frenchman is a European citizen. What makes a British citizen less of a security risk than a person coming in from France to work in London, but with a conviction for vandalism 5 years ago? The British citizen could be someone with a history of arrest for creating sectarian graffiti in the past. Currently the free travel area isn't actually extended over the whole of Europe - our decisions are made based on our assessment of whether the country in question is safe to allow for visa free travel. So if we judge the security situation in the whole of a given EU member state to be equal to or better than our own then it seems very sensible to allow them to come and go without being subjected to a background check.   The real checks should come if an EU resident wants to take up work in a sensitive profession (eg. teaching) or wants to access services that are dependent on some kind of good behaviour. We can save immense cost and potentially lost productivity by centralising our databases and putting faith in our counterparts in the other EU policing services to do their jobs properly. If we can't then we can easily envision that they wouldn't be in the visa free zone anyway. British citizens do have plenty more rights in the UK, but I don't envision the right to enter and reside without a police check as being one such right that is exclusive to our own people. That kind of right should be given to any person we can access some kind of records for, or else they should not be allowed to assume jobs or use services that might wish to exclude people with records that disbar them."
unitedkingdom,3e0x64,brycey06,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:52:31 2015 UTC,"British citizen are our own we can't do anything about them being here. We bare no responsibility for a frenchmam nor should we have to.   The way you sound we should just remove all borders, get rid of parliament, stop calling the country England and just do whatever the EU says."
unitedkingdom,3e0x64,Smileycorpse,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:55 2015 UTC,"No, we don't have responsibility for the Frenchman now. France deals with their consular affairs and takes a lot of costs if they misbehave overseas. Making misbehaving citizens even more costly to their country of origin is the solution you and I seem to agree on - France should pay for their prison cell and legal costs if they commit a crime in the UK. Most French citizens are as law abiding as ours, so I don't see the point in doing a background check if a Frenchman comes here to work in some London firm (London is one of the 'largest French cities', after all).  I think that second statement is a strawman argument. I appreciate the need for borders, but I think some borders should be less stringent that others. We have a 'border' in some sense between Wales and England based on differing laws and administrations, but this border isn't significant enough to bar free movement. Within the EU we have free movement within reason, with people free to enter without giving notice to us about their plans to arrive, but still subject to passport and records checks on arrival.   I'm certainly not anti-Parliamentary, but I do believe in the spread of power to authorities best qualified to deal with it. Mostly that means power to local people in counties and cities, but sometimes it means deciding among European countries about product standards or massive infrastructure projects that we best decide together. All of these levels should be held to account democratically. Our 'country' is called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that's what it says on my passport. I owe alliegance to no other entity, but I have a great deal of fondness for England nevertheless. If we in the UK were in a situation where the EU's needs were incompatible with ours then it would make perfect sense to weaken ties, but for now the EU serves our needs pretty well. Increasing democratic oversight by strengthening the European Parliament and weakening the European Commission (their civil service) as well as the European Council (in effect their Presidency, which is made up of European Prime Ministers working together) we can make a real difference and make the EU more accessible to people."

We never imploded before the EU and we won't implode if we wasn't apart of it.
unitedkingdom,3e0x64,Smileycorpse,2,Tue Jul 21 11:05:51 2015 UTC,"Pointless patriotism and flag waving isn't an argument against the EU. Right now, the UK is better off within a free trade bloc where standards of trade and living are agreed consensually with other members. We don't live in the 17th century, so why should we expect that the successes England achieved up until it ceased to be an independent country in 1707 should be available to us now? The United Kingdom can have a spectacular place in the world, but it quite simply wont be on the terms you desire for it.   I'm very happy with my British identity and the long and spectacular history of our islands, but that doesn't preclude being pragmatic and adopting new customs and strategies to reflect the politics of the era. If we're richer for focussing on trade with Europe rather than with land we previously colonised then the decision has been made for us. Safety and prosperity makes for a better country, rather than our flag planted in as many locations as possible."

We always used to skate with at least 3 people, 1 person kept a look out for passers by and asked them to wait if we were likely to be doing a tick ""into a path"" or similar.  We also got a LOT of hassle from the local council, who eventually conceded, built a skate-ramp which was used occasionally; but then allowed the council to use the line ""We built you a skate park (Single ramp?)

A lovely story around this; a few of my friends went skating in Spain somewhere a long time ago; they got told off for skating on some sheet-iron-welded sculptures which were along the beech front by a police man; when apparently the artist walked up - asked what they were being told off for, found out it was for using his art and his response was along the liens of:  ""If that is how they derive enjoyment from their art then fantastic"" and basically told the policeman to leave them alone."

unitedkingdom,3dxbit,LeonG17,11,Mon Jul 20 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"Its about who the customer is, not the end user or worker. For example Train Operating Companies offer poor customer service to the end user because the main customer of the TOCs is the Government, not the traveller. They agree what service improvements will be made 10 years ahead and won't change that plan no matter how the traveller's needs alter over that decade because it's fixed in the franchise agreement, as are the costs.  Similarly with companies the 'customer' of most companies is their shareholders. In capitalist thinking this is fine because the shareholders should be the public which should provide them with the proper ethical and social motivations, but in the modern globalised economy most voting shareholders are institutional investors and other organisations whose single motive is return on investment and nothing else. There is no motivation to invest in the social fabric of the business or the social fabric of the country in which that business is based.  So we have a widening disconnect between shareholder value and social value. Companies will not pay people more because staff are basically disposable and the shareholders will not countenance any policy which reduces their ROI even if it results in better productivity and innovation in the long term.  Equally the customer of political parties is, again, businesses and wealthy people, and that again skews policy."

Osborne's policy, and the wider global Conservative movement's thinking, is to say that economic productivity is low because welfare-to-work programs and benefits are too generous.   Essentially that workers are not properly motivated to work harder and get better paying jobs because they can get, in Conservative thinker's view, 'easy' money via welfare. To their minds this is why the recovery hasn't taken hold, treasury receipts are down and almost all new jobs being created are at the bottom end of the pay-scale - ergo this is why they were unable to meet their deficit reduction targets under the coalition.  The solution, in their view, is the removal of welfare-to-work policies and capping of benefits. This, they believe, will result in a more productive and motivated workforce. The result on the business end will be workers demanding and thereby receiving better paying jobs - which won't happen. Obviously they intend to remove the safety net without ensuring that business meets their pay objectives.  This same view is being expressed by Republicans in the US, Conservatives in Germany, and the UK - Osborne is blazing the trail.

When the minimum wage came in some retailers who were already paying pretty much dead on the minimum wage increased it slightly to maintain the slight difference.  While I welcome Ikea doing this, I wouldn't view it as them doing anything other than making sure they don't get absolute monkeys by paying just peanuts.   However while you may not welcome that, I do. Salaries at the lowest level need to edge up and up so that people can be economically active. It's not good for the economy to have people who have no disposable income. It's also not the kind of country I want to live in.   The 'living wage' will cause salaries not just at the bottom to move up and that's going to benefit everybody apart from the people at the very top.  Even self employed people and small business owners may fear the increase, but as long as it's not a massive juddering increase all at once then they'll benefit too, as people have more money in their pockets to spend.   You could consider it to be trickle up."
unitedkingdom,3dxbit,Rabobi,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:23 2015 UTC,Good job. The reduction in corporation tax should help make that possible too
unitedkingdom,3dxbit,davmaggs,2,Mon Jul 20 11:40:59 2015 UTC,"TBH the reduction in corporation tax is meaningful only to small businesses and even then experience suggests it won't do that much, but it sounds good when announced at the budget.   HMRC often alter the soft rules around what CT applies to as a means of compensating for the headline rate reduction. For example they altered the rules for Directors Loans so they attract a higher rate of CT to compensate for the 8% reduction during the last parliament which resulted in my business paying £1,500 in retroactive taxation.    Large businesses really only pay some corporation tax to look good, not because they have to. IKEA also has form on this  My little business with its £10k corporation tax bill often pays more than companies with massive turnovers.  Edit: CT is a tax on profitability and therefore there is a direct relationship to turnover, its also true that the higher your turnover the better accountancy advice you can afford. Whichever way you look at it structuring your global business to take costs in the UK that were incurred outside the UK in order to pay no, or very little tax here, is just wrong and an affront to business owners who do have to pay the full ride.  A 1% reduction in 2017 and a further 1% in 2020 is basically nothing but PR."

How do you think small business owners feel when we struggle to pay the Corporation Tax bill whilst discovering that Starbucks paid nothing in CT because it structured its worldwide cost base to take a loss in the UK?  Merrill Lynch, for example, structured its cost base to take its entire global loss during the recession through its London office and will pay no tax here for decades as a result.  Essentially what you're engaging in here is pedantry. My complaint is perfectly understandable and valid."

unitedkingdom,3e27yl,a-liquid-sky,4,Tue Jul 21 11:47:30 2015 UTC,"A whipped vote is when someone in the party (Usually called the Chief Whip) ""Whips"" everyone in the party into voting for what the party line on an issue is to make sure you get as many votes as possible. This is usually only done on important issues that are going to be a very close run thing, because doing it all the time leads to party members feeling like they're not allowed to have an opinion of their own on issues and they get rather upset.  To ""Defy the Whip"" is when you decide that despite being told by the Chief Whip to vote one way, you're still going to vote the other or (To save a little face) not vote at all. This generally doesn't make you friends with the people in charge of the party, so to do it you have to be feeling pretty strongly about the issue and feel the official party line is wrong."
unitedkingdom,3e27yl,StillMostlyClueless,3,Tue Jul 21 11:53:13 2015 UTC,"Just to add a bit more to the other posts, the Whip in American politics works in a similar manner to the British Whip. The differences between the two aren't actually that great, although the American House of Cards obviously raises the stakes somewhat. You may be interested to know that House of Cards was actually originally written about the House of Commons by a British author, and there's a very good TV series of the British version that was made in the early 90's (think it's all on Netflix).  Anyway, the Whips Office (for they are plural - they have a Chief Whip) are there to ensure that members of which ever political party they belong to vote in that direction. Each week, the Whips office will send out a circular to the members of its respective party telling them which way to vote. Each issue will be underlined either once, twice or three times depending on how important it is to vote that way. Defying any whip gets you in bother, and you'll get a smack on the wrist for doing so.   If you defy a three line whip, you can end up in serious trouble and may be expelled from the party. Note, however, that you are still an MP, as parties and MPs are technically separate. The action that will be taken against you probably depends on how many of your colleagues took your view, and on your past behaviour.   As a general point, however, one wonders why you would want to be a member of a party whose whip you would constantly defy as, in such a case, your views would appear not to match the party's remotely.   Note: If you harbour ambition, you do not defy your Whip, as the Whip is dictated by your party's leader/cabinet. You're unlikely to be promoted if you're unwilling to follow the party line. Some backbenchers are comfortable with that though."

unitedkingdom,3e27yl,Lordzoot,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"Think of being an MP as like having a McDonald's franchise - if you've got a choice between Maccy D's and Independent Burgers (who you've never heard of), many people will choose McDonald's because (love 'em or hate 'em) you know what you're getting with a Maccy D's.  Likewise, being an MP for a political party is a franchise, and the party gets to kick you out if you don't put the right toppings in the burgers and break hygiene rules (i.e. if you're not Tory™ or Labour™ enough).  Thus the whip is the party telling MP's ""this is how you have to vote, otherwise you'll lose the franchise"" in which case someone else will stand for MP in your area next time.  There are nuances to this - independent MPs stand little chance of success because most people want to change the government, not the local guy. And, in first past the post and the two party system, there's no backsies if your vote is wasted on the wrong guy. So your candidacy pretty much has to be backed by a major party if you're to stand a chance of being an MP.   Meanwhile, safe seats are only given to party faithful, anyway, and backbenchers know their seat is at risk at the next election. Thus backbenchers are more likely to rebel against the party whip and vote out of conscience - because they have less to lose."

Unfortunately for the MPs who do this, it could lead to them getting a black mark against them, and not being chosen for key positions/invited to all the cool parties/having some skeleton in the closet leaked to the press etc. Possibly even to the extent that the party backs an alternative candidate in the MP's constituency at the next election.  If a party declares a vote as a 'free vote' eg. the fox hunting repeal attempt and marriage equality, they're saying publically that MPs can vote however they want without the whip telling them to follow the party line (allegedly at least)."

unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,middlemanmark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Clearly not, sky and BT are the main providers now, not to mention the BBC and ITV which share the major events. You'd have to put the cap on how much the networks are bidding. It was about 5 billion for next seasons I think"
unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,genericenemy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:15 2015 UTC,Call me optimistic but I think Sky and BT Sports bubble will burst a few years down the line anyway. I'm not sure they can continue to plow money into sports rights with the growing popularity of online streaming and I don't think the UK has ever really had much of an appetite for Pay Television. There is always a massive uproar when a sport switches to Pay TV.
unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,hollowcrown51,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"The best events are always free - World Cup, Olympics, Wimbledon. Gets everyone way more involved."
unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,anagoge,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:59 2015 UTC,Genuine question: Name any petition that has resulted in affirmative action directly because of it.

unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,Leetenghui,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:39 2015 UTC,Which is being introduced. Look around Manchester and you can see infrastructure being quietly installed for it.
unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,MotorheadMad,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"So I didn't trust to signing a petition where you can't see the details of it as your link just takes you to the sign page. So removing part of the URL should take me to the actual petition information page. In doing so it says:   We’re checking this petition  5 people have already supported Oscar van Leusen’s petition.  We need to check it meets the petition standards before we publish it.  Please try again in a few days.   Just er, for those that get confused clicking that link like I did at first."
unitedkingdom,3dy7sr,oscarandjo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The link I provided is the original sharing link before its published, I'll have to repost it when it's approved."
unitedkingdom,3dy49k,Animus47,9,Mon Jul 20 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"How is this newsworthy? It looks like a pretty broad-based presentation to teachers on any potential source of disruption:   Another page lists: Shac/Animal Alliance (a reference to the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty group), climate issues, Occupy, student protests and urban explorers."

unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,rightbollocking,16,Mon Jul 20 16:59:11 2015 UTC,So many questions including but not limited to:     Money in her vagina?   How was he going to do it?   How did she store it?   Why is this a thing?
unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,Zoneghost,25,Mon Jul 20 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that she is an addict & so is he. Junkies & crackheads are often at risk of being robbed due to the company they tend to mix in, nothing is more important to them than having enough cash for their next dose so cash is always stashed.  From past experience I've seen cash hidden in all sorts of places, normally in bra or knickers for women or in socks, under insoles or in the arse crack for men.   I googled the guy & he has numerous convictions for shop lifting, a restraining order & banning orders from High St shops which is typical junkie behaviour. Plus Torquay is full of them too. I would surmise that he knew she had some cash, she tried to hide it somewhere she though he wouldn't look but was wrong...Purely hypothetical on my part of course...."

unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,Atrocitusrex,6,Mon Jul 20 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree. So pub?"
unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,Herak,4,Mon Jul 20 15:27:20 2015 UTC,Now THAT is an idea. I'll get the first round in.
unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,Atrocitusrex,9,Mon Jul 20 15:28:25 2015 UTC,I assume that's for the entire sub?
unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,nunnible,10,Mon Jul 20 16:23:59 2015 UTC,That depends - are you going to duck out when it's your turn to get the round in? cause I've already got a mate that does that.
unitedkingdom,3dyb5w,Atrocitusrex,6,Mon Jul 20 16:24:47 2015 UTC,I'll be honest. Probably for that large a round.
