ukipparty,3e2pr1,Babadoc,7,Tue Jul 21 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"I personally think STEM based skills which we are fundamentally lacking here in the UK, should be free to study or at least a low fee per term. (Including all medical training, nursing etc.)  Anything else, the current fees should apply.  But as an Englishman, I have to say it makes me sick to my stomach that (as I understand it,) it is free (or heavily subsidised) for anyone inside the EU to attend a Uni in Scotland, except if you are English. It's divisive regulation like this, which as you can hopefully understand, is why a lot of English are now getting fed up with the growing nationalism/anti English rhetoric in Scotland.  Edit: In terms of who should pay, I know that a lot of big businesses are now offering on the job training, where foundation degrees are offered, or you can work towards earning a full BSc. You receive an apprentice style wage while learning, that seems to be better than being lumped with a huge student debt, I guess.   This to me only seems fair as the business stands to gain, training potential employees up to the level that is required, while genuinely investing in the future with their profits.   Edit 2: On a side note, although I wasn't enamoured with Louise Bours appearance the other week on QT, one point she did raise, which I fully support, is recognising trades as equal in value to University degrees, like Germany does. I myself received a trade as I felt disenfranchised with the education system and I do believe there does seem to be a current snobbery towards skilled tradesmen/trades in the UK, which is ultimately destroying the industries that Britain used to excel at."
ukipparty,3e2pr1,BarryBarryson,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Where there is high demand for graduates in a certain sector which isn't being met (for example STEM) then tuition fees should be lowered depending on the demand, if there's a real problem then there should be no tuition fees or possibly even a grant. Where there's no real demand I don't mind paying more up to the £9,000 a year limit with the current system in place for payment."
ukipparty,3e2pr1,banter_lad_m8,3,Tue Jul 21 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"This is something I'd agree with. I found through painful experience x3 important variables for choosing what to do:-   Authentic Passion for a vocation/subject etc Genuine Talent for a vocation/subject etc Actual Demand in the job market for the choice above.   Fees should follow Demand. For example many people want to do art and become game artists (Big draw amongst kids and teenagers) but the stats for getting such jobs are so important to realize, if the stats are the equivalent for someone who wants to become an athlete and be sufficiently talented enough to make a living wage from it - very very few people are going to make that grade or  the stats of 1:1000 applicants to jobs and so on... that information is very important to know.  Secondly Remuneration Potential vs Investment Upfront required per vocation/course.  This information again is stuff Recruitment Consultants mug up on and it's really important for candidates to assess this information.  Because at uni there's ""return on investment"" both in future job salary and current skills and facilities available eg comparing some social science subjects x7 lectures per week ie 7hrs vs some science involving x23 structured hours + 10 individual study and access to labs, tech, tuitor groups and department networks etc etc. It's almost as if some courses are subsidizing other courses.  Information is very important in making such critical decisions in early life. But as important, YOUNG PEOPLE + DEBT CYCLES. This I think is something that should be avoided as much as possible the encouragement of taking on debt unless it's a very astute investment decision on future earning potential via the above analysis and coaching and advising.  Usury is a curse on a person and a country."

Thankfully I never had any of this feminist guilt-tripping agenda laced in with my curriculum at school but I do remember that obedient and well-behaved middle-class girls were basically treated like the perfect master race by staff, even if they were fundamentally lacking in character, morals and ethics. Boys were guilted in terms of being not as well-behaved or as highly achieving as girls, as opposed to being guilted for being potential predators. Shit, times are changing and the male suicide rates are only going to go up unless we put more support in place for our men.  I went to school in a fairly affluent market town on the Welsh border where the pupils were 95% white. Sounds great, and to an extent it was, but the only problem was that there was a focus on drama and performing arts instead of STEM. So the ones who got the most support were the ones whom the teachers favoured the most, who'd go on to do Literature or Drama or Languages instead of those who genuinely needed it and could have gone on to do great things.  I sound bitter and I still am, I didn't have a fantastic time at school and left with few GCSE's but I worked my way up through college and I'm now going to one of the top universities in the UK to do a STEM subject which I have a lot of passion for :)"

Migrants from North Africa a simple boat ride from Italy, France, etc. actually even prefer to fly to Turkey, then cross across the Turkish border over the Aegean, since the Turkish state in an unofficial manner has organized such a great smuggling infrastructure for Mahometans to over-run Europe.    http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmhaff/789/78908.htm  In terms of people smugglers, out of 93 facilitators identified in 2009, the highest proportion were Bulgarian (30), Greek (19) or Turkish (15). In 2010, there were 28 Turkish facilitators out of a total of 73. The overall reduction in the number of people smugglers arrested in 2010 was partly because the modus operandi of the traffickers has changed. In 2010, the Evros authorities observed the development of a new route of irregular migration, whereby migrants make use of cheap flights from North Africa to Istanbul, then travel on to Greece. ...   ...   Since November 2010, there has been a marked improvement in interventions from the Turkish authorities before migrants cross the border. The Frontex operation is not doing anything significantly different from the role performed by the Greek authorities, apart from providing increased personnel and provision of technical assistance in the form of cameras, helicopters and so forth. However, its presence has put pressure on Turkey to act. The Greek authorities have noticed a military presence on the Turkish border which was not there prior to the Frontex operation, Turkish border stations are now manned continuously, and new informal cooperation has started between the Greek and Turkish military. They have also noticed a reduction in corrupt dealings between Turkish officers and people smugglers.    And:     http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/world/europe/illegal-immigrants-slip-into-europe-by-way-of-greek-border.html Turkey has come under criticism because of its liberal visa requirements, which make it easy for immigrants to legally enter the country and then move on. Citizens of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Syria and Iran, among many other nations, do not need a visa to enter the country.   Those are older sources because I don't monitor the issue so closely now.

ukipparty,3dtr9x,ProfessorZ00M,2,Sun Jul 19 11:18:11 2015 UTC,"For context:   One plan is to make it easier for ministers to veto publication of certain documents, as they tried unsuccessfully to do with the recent release of letters written by Prince Charles to Labour ministers during the past decade.  Another is to change the way the cost of finding information is calculated so that officials can more readily turn down requests.  source: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3e10b852-15d2-11e5-a58d-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz3gL8FBoAs   It is always a danger that ministers will desire to hide their activities and FoIs need protection as Carswell argues.  As for the second change if applied universally, with local government that are more likely to have less developed information management, local FoIs might be disproportionately under threat due to higher costs.  We need FoI to remain an effective tool."

Why throw an easy ball about illegal immigration when the legal immigration is the real problem with the EU.   Also agree that the referendum should be more about other matters than making it solely on immigration. UKIP never seemed to focus so much on immigration until the last couple years. I suspect it might be because of the many other ukip voters who joined in the last couple of years and perhaps immigration is the only core UKIP policy left where they can all come together?

Migration is a DERIVATIVE policy aka a sub-set* of the greater PURPOSE of Brexit:-   ""Withdrawal From Political Union""   What I object to is that it turns Brexit = Migration which is Exactly what Cameron can FUDGE via Article 48 Lisbon Treaty.  It's almost as if UKIP are PLAYING ALONG with Cameron...  UKIP + Conservatives + Better Off Out / TFA  If think this is idle speculation, specious aspersions, it's quite if you understand HOW all these fit together: Better Off Out's IEA Brexit is Pipe-Dream in practicality because it's contrived and wrapped in plausibility and WHAT? = Grand Global Britannia which is appealing which is what Hannan is so consummate at selling ""The Dream"".  The Dream is a fantasy - just as much as the EU is and is now entering it's phase where it meets with reality on multiple fronts (excused away by pro-EU supporters):-   Eurocrisis Greek Bail-Out and Master-Slave relationship Migration Ukraine and Russia   The problem with Migration is not that it's not powerful nor appropriate to argue as above, but that it's easily turned into a divisive contest of ""Splendid Isolation"". To win the argument the argument needs to be:   There is a problem By Political Withdrawal we can help solve that problem for ourselves and others better. This is How.   Instead of:-   There's a nightmarish problem of migrants. Don't Let Them In!!! We Must Get Out Before it's too late!   Which is what these leaflets effectively do.  I think UKIP is becoming a mockery of itself via increasing the emotional pitch. That trick DOES WORK x1, but not for second re-run just as The Boy Who Cried Wolf tells us.   The tale concerns a shepherd boy who repeatedly tricks nearby villagers into thinking a wolf is attacking his flock. When one actually does appear and the boy again calls for help, the villagers believe that it is another false alarm and the sheep (or, in some versions of the story, the boy) are eaten by the wolf.  The moral stated at the end of the Greek version is, ""this shows how liars are rewarded: even if they tell the truth, no one believes them"". It echoes a statement attributed to Aristotle by Diogenes Laërtius in his The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, where the sage was asked what those who tell lies gain by it and he answered ""that when they speak truth they are not believed"".[3] William Caxton similarly closes his version with the remark that ""men bileve not lyghtly hym whiche is knowen for a lyer"""

(Oh, and if anyone gets shadowbanned for accidentally voting on their sub baving followed an NP link then they are very sorry and certainly didn't in any way intend for that to happen.)  Once again, your assessment is depressingly accurate (though I would say that your descriptions apply more to the modern Left, aka ""progressivism""). While the attitude described is rather naive and childish, it is not necessarily arrived at through malice: I can see why there are those who feel that natural differences in ability and productivity should be compensated for through legal force, otherwise it's ""not fair"".  But the trouble is that punishing and envying success to the extent that we see ultimately leads to everyone getting less, since it disincentivises wealth creation. Many on the modern Left seem to enjoy the ""penalising success"" part of wealth redistribution more than the ""giving to the poor"" part. This theme, of claiming to care about the downtrodden but actually caring more about punishing the more fortunate, is something that seems to run through the modern Left to a frightening extent. There doesn't seem to be much motivation among such people to find a solution which helps the less fortunate while minimising the problems caused to those who are more successful and who, whether certain people like it or not, carry society to a great extent."

The political left have built up this talking point of institutionalised oppression for a long while now, and its nebulous nature means that just about any group that doesn't have tangible 'power' in society is being oppressed and any group that succeeds and gets ahead is therefore the one doing the oppressing. There can be no business that does well without stepping on people in this world view - unless the profits from everyones work are shared equally, the owner is getting rich off the back of his workers. Never mind that he is the one taking on all the risk and it was his idea & concept to begin with.

Because their income is generated through pointing out so called inequality. For all the others they are not fighting for others. They are always fighting for themselves. Always. It's like the doctors who go onto politics shows and always say I would be willing to pay more taxes to help fund the NHS. No, taxes pay you people. How about instead of trying to get everyone else to pay more taxes, we just pay you less.   Instead of going out and trying to earn a little extra or be more responsible, the leftists love the status quo in one form. This is all that is expected/required of me, so now I will ask for more just because. Even though I knew going into this, putting in this effort I did, that this is how things are.   The difference with people on the right is that they either accept things the way they are and get on with their comfortable life or they don't stop when that hurdle is blocking their path.

ukipparty,3dse3w,YoungIcarus4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I don't think we can lump the champagne socialists in because by definition they are fighting forthemselves. Someone like Russel Brand or even Owen Jones capitalise on the ill feeling and the mistrust / identity / oppression politic to get themselves out there, sell a few books and generally be regarded as a peoples champion. I don't necessarily think this is driven by selfishness or malice, I just think they are taking the most obvious solution and don't really understand the gravity of their position in society. It's the political equivalent of ""I'm bleeding? Put a plaster on it."" rather than ""I'm bleeding? Better take the knife out first"".   But you talk about the status quo constantly creeping forward, and we have to ask ourselves what the motivation behind this is. I think it is all too easy to blame it on laziness or malice, but in reality I think it is the result of a kind of impulsive grasp at being ethical, with no real regard to the cause & effect of peoples decisions and a general disregard for the freedom of the individual. The obvious course of action to tackle poverty is to give the poor more money, or take more money from the rich, but governments and economies are a lot more complicated than that. For me, it is misleading to say that the left loves failure when it is insistent on removing peoples ability to fail entirely. I think they hate failure so much that they want to try and spend it out of existence."

They take by force from the status quo. They don't seek to beat them through competition. Which is why the ''leftist'' movement will always fail. The right leap frogs itself. The left just pulls/holds everyone back. I am not saying the left loves failure. No one does.

I could expand my points so more people could understand while reading it but then I would have to put in more detail about something that can be hard to understand and it would more likely end up just seeming like a rant. For example imagine if the ''Leftists'' were in control. They do their business and then get complacent. They don't strive.

So you'll forgive me if I think you've either been mistaken with this ""cast-iron proof"", or for some reason you're in on the lie.    unforgivable lie that you Leftists regularly tell   What a ridiculous statement. Should we talk about those racist, homophobic, bigoted statements that ""you Kippers"" regularly make? Or would be a massive generalisation?

I think I can just about bring myself to magnanimously forgive you, this time at least. But it's so frustrating not being able to show the proof to you because then you would see how wrong you are.  I am currently in double contact with both members of the pair of the two different people, and hope to reach a brace of agreements with them so that I can at least show the irrefutable evidence to you on a private basis. Watch this space!   Should we talk about those racist, homophobic, bigoted statements that ""you Kippers"" regularly make?   I know. You can hardly move for the bigotry. I in particular am ludicrously, horribly homophobic.   Or would be a massive generalisation?   Fair enough, it probably was a bit of a generalisation, although many Leftists do indeed lie through their teeth about the severe threat that Islam poses in some bizarre and failed attempt to make themselves seem ""nice"".  In any case, I just wanted to provide an example of a despicable lie about something important, and to illustrate the yawning chasm between that and someone supposedly lying about their identity on a forum which, like most Internet forums, is of precisely zero consequence in the real world.   That's exactly the kind of language that makes people like Shitlord so easy to dismiss, it's pure idiocy.   So by your logic that must mean that I'm ShitLordXurious as well. I'm ShitLordXurious! If you say it quickly then it even sounds a bit like ""I'm Spartacus""!  As for ""ShitLordXenophobe"", well, when Scotland's independent then you can have all the Muslim immigration you want, and we'll see how much you like the ""enrichment"" then once you actually have to live among it."

Farage hits the nail on the head when he describes the change in relationship between our two nations that will result if European integration continues unabated.    He's also correct that most Americans view the EU as a kind of European ""NAFTA""; however, there is a caveat here -- sadly, most Americans have no clue in hell what the European Union is.  I tend to believe that if a majority of Americans truly understood the European Union then they would oppose due to its disastrous effect on national unity, cultures, and identity.    It's also true, I think, that our relationship has been damaged due to too much American-centric bullying of our British cousins.  If the UK were to exit the EU, I sincerely hope the United States would start treating our most important trans-Atlantic partner with more respect and equal stature.

It's implied in the article that libertarian UKIP supporters don't want immigration to be controlled. But I consider myself pretty libertarian (e.g. I support legalisation of drugs, guns, euthanasia), yet I think controlling immigration is entirely consistent with that. Yes, controlling borders involves coercion, but libertarians don't want no coercion, they want to minimise it.  Coercion seems necessary to me in this instance: for a start, there are many parts of the world where people are extremely collectivist, often religiously so, and we have to have some mechanism which stops them from coming here in large numbers and using our (remaining) democracy to take us over. I mean, two words: Tower Hamlets.  I could go on for ages, but that would probably just annoy people :-)"

We define Brexit acronym for ""British Exit""  ""British Exit"" aka Brexit = ""Withdrawal From Political Union (EU)""  This is using parsimony to define our terms more distinctly and hence rigorously.  From this it is unquestionably obvious that the successful condition for withdrawal is removal of membership to the EU Institutions.  From this it is INFERRED that any ""Brexit"" be Economically Neutral OR Positive.  Given that the Political Transition is a huge event akin to the ""Collapse Of The Berlin Wall"" to quote Dr. North's Flexcit; hence Political Uncertainty will impact markets. Given this the conditions to minimize this are:-   Speed of Withdrawal and Agreement Ready Made and Clearly Defined Status and Outcome For the UK IMMEDIATELY upon Withdrawal. Enacting ""the will of the people"" on such a Referendum outcome Following THE RULES = Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty   You'll find that all these things suggest there's no great economic advantage on immediate exit, but there could be worthwhile advantages set up as seeds to grow into large growth in the future based off rejoining the real global top tables above the EU Institutions which are necessarily unmeasurable or open to high error and erroneous assumptions in any economic modelling scenarios.

North had been a researcher for UKIP's EU bloc and had been named as a MEP candidate but was deselected or pushed back in favour of one Godfrey Bloom. North then went on to write a poisoned pen letter about Nigel Farage which one Alan Sked, original founder of not only UKIP but also the Bruges Group and who spectacularly managed to get himself removed from both, then included in an article he wrote for the Telegraph (all the old names are coming out, aren't they?!!) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3606602/As-founder-of-the-UKIP-I-will-vote-Tory.html[2] So here we are. Richard North's website http://eureferendum.com/[3] , the same one that for wonderous reasons unknown is in the sidebar of the UKIP subreddit, who acrimoniously broke from UKIP, promotes FLEXIT as its Brexit plan for the UK leaving the EU. Flexit not only breaks away from other exit papers in how it would leave, but it also includes direct attacks on certain political parties...yeah, you've guessed. Other papers tend to stick to the economics and legal arguments of how and what should be done and stay out of the party politics. When the institute of Economic Affairs ran their 2014 Brexit prize they also only shortlisted papers that supported either a Free Trade solution or an EFTA solution. All EEA proposals (like Norway's deal) didn't make the grade in the eyes of the judges and were eliminated in the earlier rounds - including Richard North's FLEXIT. The problem with the EEA deal is now that where over 70% of the UK now want immigration controlls, the only immigration controls the EEA solution provides are piecemeal, temporary, and only in certain circumstances. That if a no small proportion of the people will be swayed to leave the EU so we can have immigration controls then backing an EEA solution for them would be a betrayal. If you're a committed advocate or Richard North's Flexit someone pointing out why the UK adopting an EEA solution is not likely and not one backed by Better Off Out, UKIP, or most commentators of other parties, and why, must really be a source of chagrin.  Cheers, by the way."
ukipparty,3dovtc,Carlswaen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"Here, by his own pen: More Propaganda.  Anyone serious about making their own minds up for themselves and not relying on propagandists need only use this link to Brexit papers I made earlier:-  List Of Brexit Plans by Categorical Organization  Someone was posting which books to read recently here on r-ukip... if you were to go to a big bookshop which stored all the top EU/Brexit books on it's shelves in one neat section on eg ""European Union"" and had the luxury of reading the entire catalogue... guess what?  You could easily come out of it with much more information but still very little clear idea of Brexit.  I done this exercise myself mentally at FOYLES on CHARING CROSS ROAD (one of the UK's largest bookshops - diminished in it's new location adjacent to it's previous building from the old art school). The only book that really shines any light on this is Robert Oulds: ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About The EU But Were To Afraid To Ask?"" There's so much dross there and it's very dense and boring too!  Incidentally underneath the ""European Union"" section is the ""Slavery"" section. :-D  That's all a set-up for what's coming next, which is... this:-   The Organizational Information around Brexit and understanding it in context is almost crucial to aiding understanding of the hardest part of the 3 major areas:-    Why? - Leave The EU How? - Do We Leave The EU What? - Does It Look Like After The EU   I think the great mistake Carl is making is trying to win public support for 3. without COHERENCE and CONSISTENCY with 2. first to then inform what? 3. looks like.  So you see the organizational understanding as well as ""the what"" is all important. Why is it important? If we look at what we are really fighting against, it's not people it's such as what is known as The Great Deception for x1 example, and therefore we're beholden not to deceive ourselves and hence deceive others too in our efforts to argue a case.  What's so childish about Carl's support of the EFTA + Bi-Laterals / Association Agreement is that it's all about POWER in the hands of the FEW.

First, I've had a bug from an update which prevented me logging in as well as being otherwise disposed: The Summer with Cricket, Golf and Cycling all in sunny abundance. :-)  I posted something of a rambling and somewhat cryptic post on Richard Dean you can still see in the subreddit.  This was to give an example of a Pro-EU ""talking more sense and arguing more strongly"" on EU Regulations than EU-Sceptics at Conservative Home.  If that is possible (and it certainly is) then the other way is true too: An EU-Sceptic ""talking less sense and arguing less strongly"" which is what I've accused Carl of doing due to his priority not in strong argument but in strong propaganda of his chosen Brexit plan of attack via BetterOffOut + Conservatives + UKIP.  What is so deceptive about Carl however is that he uses what he's doing to accuse Dr. North of doing and never misses an opportunity to sing those lies!  We alls should know by now that NOTHING is as it seems with the EU. Well, ""get ready for a surprise!"" because just as with the whole rationale for entering the EU the very same deception is being played on the arguments given for ""leaving the EU"" according to the erroneous logic of the so-called illustrious IEA Prize Finalist Paper that's a set-up for:-   Staying IN the EU at Referendum Gaining Political I.O.U.'s from Cameron for future Assocation corralling   Namely power and control is what counts and that's what the powers that be are all about - not truth, not reformation and necessary renewal.  If you don't argue with intellectual honesty but you rely on ""prestige and authority"" guess what you DESERVE THE EU which will simply take up shape in another form and another guise... again.  The problem with Singhalese, is that you conceptualize things ""tribally"" in a contest: Us vs Them. But if you're not entirely accurate about ""us"" or even ""them"" you're going to find things don't quite work out the way you anticipated they would.  That's all food for thought to think about... (hence food). Put it simply after reading the above: EU-Sceptics only have REAL arguments left amongst themselves! Now I know you all CAN buy that line with ease - apart from it's veracity value checking out green for go! It's simple when you look at it that way. Sure there are derivative arguments Pro-EU's can still win eg the stale Regulations argument and indeed, here's a great saying which perhaps needs to be the very very first thing all EU-Sceptics or as they really start calling themselves more and more now: Anti-EU's/Pro-Brexit'ers:-   ""Frustra fit per plura, quod potest fieri per pauciora."" ~ Summa Totius Logicae, i. 12, Occam's Razor; William Of Occam   It is pointless to do with more what can be done with fewer.

This was all at the same time when it was discussed whether /r/european link should be taken out of the sidebar (and I can't believe it sat there for as long as it did - quite bad really) and full credit to the user that raised it and the community that voted to remove it.  Also I was quite taken back to see a mod here helping people access the sub coontown.  I mean, WTF?

Like I said at the start, I feel I made the right choice  and I'm sure the other people are perfectly okay with a Carlswaen shaped hole too ;)  I've never had a problem discussing UKIP or an EU Exit, British or European politics in general on either r/ukpolitics, r//unitedkingdom, or r/europe.  If anything recently because of it I've found people more receptive to euroscepticism and a British exit - not less.  Bizarrely standing up to /r/European has made people more receptive to other argument, or at least be more civil.  There are exceptions to the rule of course, but still."
ukipparty,3dovtc,YoungIcarus4,2,Sun Jul 19 09:11:07 2015 UTC,Stop playing the I am not aware BS. The fact that you would compile such an attack on /u/erowidtrance shows you know exactly the problems with /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics Subs which have almost all the same mods. Then to further that the people of /r/badukpolitics It's about time there was some consistency with these ridiculous positions you keep taking.
ukipparty,3dovtc,Carlswaen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:58:11 2015 UTC,"I've not said I'm not aware, in fact I even acknowledged there was an issue but as I said elsewhere with a little tact one can navigate the likes of /r/unitedkingdom and /r/europe quite easily.  /r/ukpolitics for the most part being an absolute doddle compared to what it used to be and is quite open to varying political opinion.  I realise they've classed you as a persona non grata, for whatever reason I'm sure you won't want to self-reflect on here, but for those of us that can raise their game we can question the respective echo chambers - as /r/ukpolitics once was.  Now they're more likely to complain that it's become a UKIP circle jerk, whereas it's in reality more of a plurality where tempered language can work well - like in the link in the OPs title!  What that has to do with r/european's racism and censorship of other lines of thinking, but censorship never the less, I'm not sure.  Talk about conflating matters...  Nevermind, no point unsubscribing from here if only to allow myself to keep getting called back.  These sort of issues will of course keep rearing their heads until addressed - but it'll continue to be me not raising them first, but talking candidly when they are.  TTFN."
ukipparty,3dovtc,YoungIcarus4,2,Sun Jul 19 13:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'll labour the point again because it needed labouring last time; in not wanting to be a member of a community which shared mods with /r/european   Can you please explain the problem of being a moderator of conflicting areas of reddit?  In my naive mind a moderator is/should be impartial and apply rules even handedly.  In that role they are not endorsing content by applying rules that allow the content to be there.  In favour of free speech > censorship (political correctness?) .. being a moderate somewhere means essentially nothing other than you are trusted to apply rules.  Best thing about free speech is that deranged lunatics can stand on their soap boxes all they want but they will run out of people of substance to listen to them.  I know this is the internet and anyone can signup for a subreddit and mod it in their own interests but it is the person actions not their associations that counts.

ukipparty,3dovtc,Carlswaen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's a conflict of interest when one is what I now see is a widely known white-supremacist racist community, and one which they preside over.  At the time they actually nailed it on their head appealing for the matter to die down because it gives critics of the party ammunition.  The thing is, whether one agrees with it or not, just by sharing a mod, just as assuredly as just having a link to it was used as ammunition,  is used to smear the whole.  I'm not saying whether it's right or wrong, but it's just one more unnecessary obstacle for this community as a whole to overcome.  It's no longer an obstacle for me because a month ago (yesterday - that month's gold just ran out) this whole /r/european and /r/ukipparty connection reared its ugly head again on /r/ukpolitics where I stated why it was that I'd felt I had to unsubscribe.  People who were not UKIP supporters (and in some cases really quite opposed) immediately commended me.  And what I have now seen is where they had previously nothing good to say about UKIP and its supporters I'm seeing more caveats.  They're acknowledging some are more principled and acknowledge that the wider community actually voted to have nothing to do with /r/european and to cut ALL ties.  Non-UKIP people have become more open and I'm now getting endorsements from other sources.    I've seen the argument of free speech being used for that sub before, but it falls up short when you see just how many people they do ban (and they provide it in the sidebar - or they did last time I checked).  It's not that they're pro-free speech, it's just that they don't ban hate speech.  They're okay with banning other stuff.  The sub was set up by some particularly racist people as an outlet for a certain line of thought.  That much is clear.  Some people claim that the community it has attracted is an unfortunate side effect of not banning hate speech - to they I say if that ever were the case, which I don't believe it is, then the hate speech advocates have long since driven other people away.  It is a person's actions that count.  I agree.   But agreeing to be a moderator of what is clearly a racist subreddit, or has since become a racist subreddit if one prefers to argue that, isn't an inaction by any means.     If they asked me to be a moderator of that place I don't think I'd be able to say ""Go fuck yourself"" fast enough.  ANYWAYS...  Here is the original thread where it first went public off subreddit and in the wider community over at /r/ukpolitics and where it was discussed at length.  As I originally predicted this will keep cropping up and genuine UKIP supporters will time and time again find themselves having to state how that isn't indicative of them - however tenuous the links and spin.  It has cropped up since.  I've never been the first to re-raise it, but I've also said that if asked or when the topic is raised I won't lie."

You align yourself with the worst of the worst on reddit.
ukipparty,3dovtc,Paludosa2,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"If you go to UK politics you don't align with 'politics'.  Everybody has their own.  If as a UKIP member and supporter you align with a specific UKIP sub then yes, you are a representative and to an extent it is representative of you.  I just chose to make the personal choice to make the distinction clearer between me as a UKIP supporter and a minority of UKIP supporters and actions of the UKIP subreddit.   You align yourself with the worst of the worst on reddit.   ???  Pretty sure I don't.    Anyway, I'll take your advice into consideration."
ukipparty,3dovtc,dougal83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:51 2015 UTC,The thread you linked to. You are getting whinny about someone for other people's actions. Yet you will never say boo to people who are not 'UKIP' who say and do far worse. It's clear to me that you simply wanted to assert some dominance. You wanted people to make a choice between you and them. All just a power play. It's so obvious. Drop the passive aggressive BS too.
ukipparty,3dovtc,Paludosa2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I don't.    I think he's talking about /r/unitedkingdom who are notoriously against any form of un-PC content and will swiftly downvote you because it makes them feel righteous. If anything which is not politically correct gets posted for the sake of discussion it will be silenced, and very quickly indeed.  It is undeniably an echo chamber, but I'll keep posting there because it's my right to and if they silence us for mere free speech then they are the worst of the worst on Reddit.  I also agree with your points about moderation (of subreddits), but perhaps that should be better left to private messages and not public arguments like this thread.  We all saw how much damage the public infighting did after the election within UKIP, and we'd be much better off if we didn't have threads like these popping up every few days. We need to be stronger than this."
ukipparty,3dovtc,dougal83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"It is undeniably an echo chamber, but I'll keep posting there because it's my right to and if they silence us for mere free speech then they are the worst of the worst on Reddit.   I've found that whilst it is an echo chamber if you tighten your language, watch your blindspots, and preemptively back things up more, you can actually offset the downvotes you can't avoid and do quite well.  Often it's not so much what one says, but the way one says it.  It's definitely rarified upvoting but one can certainly find them whilst staying on point if you can adapt your 'delivery'.  I don't avoid dissenting opinion because that's what tests and develops arguments.  If you can't back something up then it isn't a strong argument which you should either change or drop it, or find another way to express it which makes contact with more people.  It's the only real way to cut one's teeth.  It's not all theory.  It's a shame they took away displaying the number of upvotes and downvotes to a comment because that definitely helped illustrate that there were people voting not just by what they agreed with.   I also agree with your points about moderation (of subreddits), but perhaps that should be better left to private messages and not public arguments like this thread.   The very last time the /r/european matter did raise its head again, a couple of weeks ago, it was done in private.  But on that occasion the comment was well on its way to being buried and it had failed to spark any follow up comments so replying to it would have fanned the flames.  Alas that tends to be the exception and not the rule.  The problem is it's not just infighting but also a lot of people  looking in and they're identifying these issues themselves before any infighting crops up, and if you only address these issues in private it looks like we're either indifferent or silently condoning.  And that's not the case.  I've actually found that by willing to speak up and call things out that undecideds and people wavering are more inclined to listen.  With regards to the issue in the submission I have actually been intentionally limiting contact recently but it is unrelated to politics.  I'll address the issue about the EEA when other users bring it up, but for reasons of a different design I'd rather not go into I'm keeping my distance where possible."
ukipparty,3dovtc,Paludosa2,2,Sat Jul 18 17:03:20 2015 UTC,I used to care but no longer do. I would rather people could voice their true opinions and share platforms with others than be censored. Because that is what is happening. A few people are trying to control the entire UK political debate on Reddit. That's bullshit and that is the BIG problem.
ukipparty,3dovtc,dougal83,3,Sat Jul 18 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, Carl was good at debunking that thread in the main. But that's the same with UKIP: Very good at attacking the Pro-EU's, very poor at actually defending coming up with a Brexit plan: Which needs all the criticism it can get, to like a whetstone sharpen it and leave the best to last! If I argue with Carl or persuade the poster I replied to how to argue more constructively with Carl's position, it does not mean I rate Carl less than whoever it was I replied to! Reddit should be thanking me and showering me in gold for such a line!!  On my selection of sources. I did some time ago use UKIP and UKIPDAILY and some other UKIP MEP's but on the whole the rate of good articles as well the the volume of good/useful articles I found to be too low and hence to sustain my efficiency in posting and hence save myself time, dropped checking those sources altogether."

ukipparty,3dovtc,YoungIcarus4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.  I think ""variety is the spice of life"" is a good ""modus operandi"": It's trying to convey an appreciation that answers are rarely black and white or if they are they're either trivial or immensely well-worked out!  But also different approach by different people needs to be entertained, too. I hope variety helps here, though the problem is consistency and often a distinct loss of coherency!!! ;-) Guilty as charged.  As said the major arguments remaining are between EU-Sceptics and their transition to Pro-Brexiters. THAT is the real battle with ourselves.  The good thing about Carl is that he's knowledgeable and actually knows how to argue most of the derivative points about Brexit or the EU. Not many can, yet on the essential points he's tendentious, leaning on ""argument from authority"". I mean I followed the IEA Brexit Prize process, read all the papers, lots of commentary and analysis and what Carl's decided is that he needs an advert, gilded edgings, oil painting colours and a large and lavish canvas called IEA to promote his favourite Brexit plan all the while accusing FLEXCIT of the very same thing as well as character assasinating Dr. North as ""Sour Grapes""/""Grim Up North"" (!) for being booted from UKIP.  Just look at UKIP's output. It's not nearly good enough for the potential that exists in the British people."
ukipparty,3dovtc,dougal83,2,Sun Jul 19 09:37:13 2015 UTC,"I appreciate Carl's postings too.  My browsing habit means that I tend not to see him as I've got this sub bookmarked(as it more often has something interesting to read).  I did not know that about Dr. North.  I was just having a google about him as I was trying to figure out why EUReferendum.com is so biased against UKIP. I was musing that he might be a flexit merchant from the right wing tories, or a paid shil of some kind as I find his arguments overly opinionated. It's like the site bases it's opinion on UKIP on loony with a twitter account.  Bizarre, how it just keeps coming but never has references to back up the opinion.  Do you know of anything I can read about Richard North and UKIP relations? I tried asking about UKIP bias on their comments section on an article a while back but the question seemed an ephemeral one at that as it no longer appeared on the site shortly after.  I have to say though that people who are crying about you are a detriment to their cause.  An argument that stands up to scrutiny is a strong one.  I'd take a strong argument over ""being on message"" any day of the week.  It may indicative that the complaining is due to lack of being able to engage but I hope they take up the challenge.  There is a time and a place for being ""on message"" but I don't think it is reddit discussion forums! :p"
ukipparty,3dovtc,YoungIcarus4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:14:46 2015 UTC,"Isn't that part of the essential appeal of UKIP: ""Not The Establishment"":-   Do As They Say/Believe Independence of Thought Not Career but Patriotic   etc sadly all eroded and day-by-day just come across as more and more similar to the Establishment. The problem possibly arises from ""lack of self-belief"" which leads to ""reaching for solutions"" and that's the seed of the error of their ways I'd make a guess at.  UKIP: impersonal prejudice  I don't know the details, but I do know that small-mindedness is the defeat for the No Camp already sealed in 2017. IE as a total group there never was such a thing. The irony is that this may be the true nature of how things really work at the highest levels - out of reach of unworthy people."
ukipparty,3dovtc,dougal83,2,Sun Jul 19 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"From reading that, an article someone just happened to publish despite protestations of no hard feelings... he is one bitter mtha fcker. lol.  A guy wanted him out of the party, he's now out of the party, he's says he's not resentful.  He then goes on to talk about Dan Hodges.. one of the worst journalists as integrity goes, as not having a personal reason to attack UKIP.... he works for the Torygraph!  Hodges don't need a personal reason! lol  If he really didn't care though then IMO he would not take the time to write the article.  With regards to not being the establishment though, if they were to gain any real power then that argument for them becomes nullified so voting for them on that reason is just stupid.  To get elected, you've got to engage in playing the game.  Carswell notably elected not to accept every penny of the short money acting on his principals so that is a good sign.  I'm not sure I'd agree with the third bullet point as you put it, people with experience of real life yes, localism focus on their electorate's needs.  Patriotism get's muddied by politics and I find it too close to nationalism.  Back to Dr North though, I didn't know the back story yet I could tell something was not right about him RE: UKIP.  Either Nigel is a total bastard or Dr North has a pathological condition of the mind that was best snipped in the bud.  I just hope for the best and that the ""No"" vote campaign turns out the best solution and promotes it effectively.  Hard for some people to focus on that fact."

Once you saw how it worked you could understand a phenomenon which otherwise made no sense at all: the difficulty Greek people have saying a kind word about one another. Individual Greeks are delightful: funny, warm, smart, and good company. I left two dozen interviews saying to myself, “What great people!” They do not share the sentiment about one another: the hardest thing to do in Greece is to get one Greek to compliment another behind his back. No success of any kind is regarded without suspicion. Everyone is pretty sure everyone is cheating on his taxes, or bribing politicians, or taking bribes, or lying about the value of his real estate. And this total absence of faith in one another is self-reinforcing. The epidemic of lying and cheating and stealing makes any sort of civic life impossible; the collapse of civic life only encourages more lying, cheating, and stealing. Lacking faith in one another, they fall back on themselves and their families."

ukipparty,3di15d,mynameisfreddit,7,Fri Jul 17 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"As a working class, non union, financially responsible, private sector worker there is still nothing that would make me even considering voting Labour with Jeremy Corbyn in charge. Only solution is to drastically reduce low skilled immigration, that would help the wage squeeze.  The only way a growing economy helps the Working Class is very simple   The economy improves Demand for work goes up Limited supply of labour force results in higher wages for the working class GDP doesn't grow as fast as it could, but GDP per capita and average living standards in improve   Result - economy grows initially slower, but as the economy grows, working class benefits from growth. As the working class have more disposable income, they spend more, good for living standards and total GDP in the end.  Current situation   The economy improves Demand for work goes up More immigration No increase in wages as a result of unlimited supply of cheap labour Higher immigration = Increase in demand for housing, schools, health care with no wage increase GDP initially grows faster than situation 1, but for the working class, living standards fall, affordability of housing decreases, public sector services under strain, -    Result - the working class are made far worse off. GDP rises, GDP per capita falls.  Only solution is to reduce immigration, only way to do that is to leave the EU, only way to do that is by voting UKIP.  One thing that really struck me on the leaders debate was Nigel saying ""Can no one else here really accept the fundamental number one rule of economics of supply and demand!"""
ukipparty,3di15d,tusksrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"Result - the working class are made far worse off. GDP rises, GDP per capita falls.   Here's a graph of UK GDP per capita adjusted for inflation:  http://www.economicvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ercchart0415.gif  You'll notice that falls do not correlate to periods of mass immigration. Instead, they correlate to falls in the strength of the economy. The dip happened in 2007, during the global financial crisis, not 2004, when the EU (and its freedom of movement) was massively expanded. GDP per capita is not falling, it is rising and the rate at which it is rising is rising too.  Your post is well put, but it seems to be based on things which aren't true."

He is just going to alienate typical Labour voters further. You think Gordon Brown calling that woman a bigot in his car was bad. I won't be surprised if he loses his shit at a voter in front of the cameras. There is a reason why people in UKIP and the Conservative setup are rubbing their hands with glee. They know first hand what this man is like and have been on the back end of his rants.   In regards to the EU I don't know his position. One would hope a so called man of principle would see the project for what it is and back democracy over such a project.

ukipparty,3di15d,muscleriot,2,Thu Jul 16 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"Where UKIP ran in Labour Seats it got about 6000 votes per seat, and in Conservative Seats it got about 7000. (Taking the 1.4m UKIP votes where it ran in 235 Labour Seats, and the 2.4m in 330 Tory Seats and dividing uniformly). I cannot see the appeal lasting of UKIP in Labour Seats as its policy set other than the highly popular Stop Mass Immigration and get out the EU, is to cut further and farther than the Tories and remove taxes on the rich, which is directly against the interests of the voters in these seats. A typical Labour seat is made up of approx. 50% welfare claimants, 25% public sector workers - most of whom vote Labour unwaveringly even though 1/5th or so are fed up of mass immigration. ( I guess the fact that UKIP got about 6k votes per Labour seat shows how desperate ordinary working people are about the 2 main issues. The votes are largely 'lent' though.)   So Corbyn could go down well with a bulk of voters in many of these seats, despite his love of mass immigration. I would say he is closer to the average Labour grassroots member's views nowadays than the media portrays as a outsider. (As the membership has collapsed in Labour the more narrow the type of person that remains as a member) In fact I suspect if welfare cutting candidates win the Labour leadership contest, then Labour would lose more of its heartland vote like with the SNP. Corbyn is the best candidate to hold these types of constituencies. (The SNP have recently been saying they want to extend their status as a challenger party to these Labour stronghold seats).   It's clear to me UKIP has to change to a more democratic party under new leadership to have any chance of making inroads into either vote."

UKIP has been much closer to the American right than any other UK party for years (small state, low taxes, individual freedom, loosening gun laws) and this is unsurprisingly reflected in closer ties.  However there seems to be a strong undercurrent of Anti-Americanism in modern British society (mainly of the sneering contempt motivated by an inferiority complex variety) that UKIP is now suddenly meant to reflect in order to appeal to ex-Labour voters."

You should have seen the disbelief on their faces when I took them to a small village near Kaposvar.  Another world... poverty. Abandoned houses due to inheritance taxes and no money to pay for them etc.  Romany gypsies' rubbish tip was a highlight along with the local palinka shed/factory. :)  If you go to the cites, it's just so modern....

As you can see from this submission, people seem to like the EU here. Although I have to admit, I had university classes where people did not know what federalism actually is, so this poll might be irrelevant.  I think the main reason for that is that our past governments fucked up big time. All of them, regardless of their political spectrum. I have this (absurd) theory, that our complete political elite needs to be eradicated (might be a strong word), and empty slots should be filled with EU-appointed professionals. Corruption and belief in the system is that bad here; voter turnout last year was 50x %. That almost means every second Hungarian ignoring the elections. I'm not sure how it goes in other countries, but this smells unhealthy.  I'm not gonna lie, I also wanted to move to the UK (although I'm not exactly a run of the mill burger flipper, I'll have a CPA soon). I never really delved into the benefit system, last time I heard some of them are granted even if you don't do anything. I find that ridiculous, especially that we are talking about lots of money here, and the price levels are not Norway or Singapore-level different, except for London I presume. Changing benefits' conditions is something I agree with, even as a potential ""immigrant"", someone who would profit out of it. (Well I hope it is not a Tory idea but a UKIP one, else I've fucked up here.)  My long story short opinion would be: I think it is good for Hungary, pretty sure there are bad points to it but I cannot name one. Still, I find it crazy that ~300k Hungarians live in London. That makes it the second largest city in terms of Hungarian population. I mean, tell something like that about Austria or Germany and I'd say yeah, I expected that one, but Great Britain? I never saw that one coming.  Sorry for effing up the grammatical tenses, we only have three."

When competing against English nationals they only stand a fair chance at a job in a corporate faceless entity (read low paid, low skill, or head hunted from overseas). If you come over without a job offer then it's likely you'll be effectively forced into economic slavery.  I'm a fan of work permits, if we lack skills we let in people to fill the roles.  I might emigrate to Australia, my skill set is highly rated on their points system and on top of that I could trust the government to look out for it's electorates interests."

If the people in a lawful process on a civil matter don't like you then you're getting a fine regardless.  This guy got investigated for giving out free sausage rolls... just pointing it out.  When I was younger I was in a run down old Nissan sunny with a couple of well spoken friends from school.  We were doing nothing suspicious driving from A to B in countryside on a sunny day.  Stopped by cops to search our vehicle on the premise that there had been burglaries in the area.  The first cop appeared taken aback when we spoke.  Maybe he's acting on prejudice, I was thinking so I sarcastically asked if daytime burglary was an issue we should be concerned about.  All said and done we went on our way. Out of curiosity I enquired in the number of burglaries in that area, none within 15 mile radius within the last 3 years.  I'd call that lying in pursuit of trying to reach arbitrary targets.  Chances might be good to maybe find some weed on a few young people on a sunny afternoon?  Not exactly fighting crime...  Sorry for digressing... damn pigs! :p"

As a result of this fear, they would rather oppose leaving the EU than be perceived as aligning themselves with UKIP and the various right wing eurosceptic groups across the EU.

People like Jones are consumed with caring about who else holds certain positions and how that might reflect on them, they can't just work alongside a party like UKIP for a common cause. The left must take over the eurosceptic position and wrench it from the tainted hands of those dirty racists. Progressives won't just vote to leave based on it's merits, it has to be packaged for them so they don't feel dirtied by who they might be aligned with and an out vote can't possibly be allowed to benefit UKIP.

This is a monstrous case of debt-fueled dependency politics.  The Greeks (and more astoundingly, the Germans) have known for years where this was heading, and despite all that Tsipras getting elected marked the point where the Takers tell the Makers to ""stick 'em up!"".  He essentially weaponized Greece's debt, banking on (no pun intended) the idea that the EU would say Greece was too big to fail and keep cutting them a welfare check. Greece knows that the Germans and all their big bank buddies will have to make the tough choice of cutting their losses, or bailing Greece out AGAIN in order to ever see a penny back from their investments.

I'm usually pro-UKIP/anti-EU on both and I usually get upvoted. Why? Because I choose my words carefully, try to be reasonable, and don't get upset and lash out when people challenge my views.  I accept that they may be right and that I might be wrong. Try to think and act like a politician. Pretend you're giving an interview on the BBC, even.  I met a friend of mine on the weekend, who was once very high up in UKIP, and she gave me a ton of political advice. I could have been offended and reacted that way but instead I took the advice on board and it made me question my political ability. As a result it confirmed to myself that I am not ready to stand until at least 2020 because I'm not as experienced as I should be. I need to refine my debate style, get better at economics and critical thinking. Nobody is perfect, not even ""are Nige"".  That's what the process of political interaction is all about on Reddit. You should want leftists to debate with you because it makes you a better and more knowledgeable person, and better at politics. Comments like this are not helpful.  Now, I'm not saying that you or anyone else has been banned for lashing out, and it's probably true that some inexperienced mods may have banned you maliciously, but as long as you stay within the rules of Reddit, the subreddit, and don't call anyone an utter twat you should probably be fine.  Read comments by /u/carlswaen if it helps. He's a very good poster."
ukipparty,3da6d8,RichieSM,3,Tue Jul 14 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"I agree.   I think the most useful and constructive political subs are those that have a number of different opinions.

That's fine if you want a circlejerk where everybody discusses how right they all are about everything, but somewhat counterproductive if you actual want political discussion."

That African nations are having larger GDP growth than the UK doesn't mean that economic migrants stop coming to the EU for work, because they can still earn more by coming.  Fair enough point - I'd have thought - and one backed up [by] recent events.  In response: ""Africa isn't some baron useless cesspit"", and I did not appreciate somebody suggesting that I had said it were.  There was no 'losing it'.

ukipparty,3da6d8,tusksrus,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:02:41 2015 UTC,No it isn't. Some people genuinely do think that. I don't. I never said they do or implied they do. A huge part of the problem is the EU's policies and approach in relation to trade tariffs and the common agricultural policy. More to the point /u/RichieSM said people should use reddit in the manor /u/Carlswaen does. A user that can be just as immature and pathetic as the rest of us. As evidenced by our encounter.

ukipparty,3da6d8,YoungIcarus4,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"My logic is/was sound in relation to GDP and how we all use it.   I'm not an economist, but I think your point was about GDP growth whereas Carlswaen's point was that the actual difference in GDP in absolute terms was so large that migration to the UK does still make a lot of sense.  He said as much,   You don't have to buy a house or try to aim for a higher standard of living here. You can come, live on the cheap, cash up, and what fraction you can send back still be worth much more than an entire wage had you not left.   You did respond,   Sometimes being with your family, by their side helping to provide for them there is better than sending back cash. One problem is the trade barriers between the EU and Africa. China got it right. Building infrastructure in exchange for resources, etc. There is only so much work in the UK for someone who does not speak the language and has no education.   But I'm not sure if I would have replied either - because frankly the Africa comment is more interesting. Just briefly, though:  While it's true that ""sometimes"" it's better to stay in your own country, presumably the people that doing that is better for, are the ones that stay. People can make their own minds up whether it is better for them to move to the UK to send money back, or to stay at home.   I doubt Carlswaen disagreed with you that the European countries and the African ones could trade more - that's a standard UKIP view, and one that I share too.   There is, also, a surprising amount of work for them, as they're willing to work hard for lower pay and that's desirable. Obviously, this means fewer jobs for everyone else (a clear problem), but the contention was that    I find it funny that people say these economic migrants are coming to the UK because of our expanding job market. Because nowhere in Africa is seeing exactly that...GDP growth is up to 4 times higher in some African nations than it is in the UK.   The thing that really grates with the Africa comment is not the content (you are certainly correct that Africa is not a ""baron useless cesspit""), it's the fact that it hadn't been suggested that it was at any point."

I am not trying to appeal to the Left, using logic, reason, and facts, but to drive them mad, by pointing out their lack of it.  My intention is to help the Left become completely insane, by remaining pointedly and apologetically right wing myself. They can not tolerate different views to their own, and hate to hear them, so they downvote on sight, ban, ridicule and ostracise anyone that espouses such opinions. The result of this is that they retreat ever further into their safe spaces, circle jerks, and echo chambers, where their views become ever more extreme and peculiar, such that they do not resonate with ordinary people in any way whatsoever. This makes the left bizarre, unappealing and unelectable, so in the absence of a credible Left wing position, the country naturally moves to the Right by default.   The Left are never Right.

They are driven by utopian visions, and unachievable  dreams of equality, not real world pragmatism.  Do you also invite scientologists, Jehovah's witnesses, and Mormons into your home with the notion that they might be right, and you might be wrong? Such behaviour is a recipe for indoctrination.

ukipparty,3d97wh,Kingy_who,10,Tue Jul 14 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"Frequently (in fact pretty much always for high-profile issues), there are two different sets of studies which ""show"" things that are the exact opposite of each other. Usually, studies will show whatever those funding them want them to, so the BBC Trust thing is significant here, whether or not you want it to be.  Assuming you watched the Evan Davis interview, and other BBC interviews and coverage of UKIP in the months before the election, it amazes me that you could genuinely not see the bias. Just one example is the different types of questions that UKIP people get compared to other parties: Farage frequently gets grillings over what UKIP and even ex-UKIP councillors have said, while other party leaders are never asked about their councillors, even when they've gone to jail or been involved in kiddie-fiddling.  And they had a news item in Grimsby where they asked each of the General Election candidates questions in turn. It was particularly obvious then that the questions for UKIP were completely different in kind to the questions the other candidates were getting. Victoria Ayling responded brilliantly, pointing out sneeringly that the BBC were biased against UKIP because they received EU funding (I have certainly never seen them described as ""Eurospectic"" before...that's a gem, that one!)  Another Labour supporter, by the name of /u/tusksrus, posts here. I would guess that even he wouldn't deny that the BBC is biased against UKIP."

ukipparty,3d97wh,Zanza_N,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"I wish I did, then I would have linked to it. But I remember thinking that the BBC were very biased towards the lib-dems in the 2010 election and looking to see if I was right. I found a survey that proved it, but it might have changed since and I can't find it now, it was from a newspaper's website.   Also, there is a large over-representation of Scottish, Welsh and immigrants in the BBC - making English people a minority, at least amongst news and current affairs presenters and correspondents. People from Scotland and Wales are less likely to be tory voters, as are most immigrants. Furthermore, publicly funded organisations are usually more Labour orientated than private-sector employees. And as a last point, media professions are taken, on average, more by leftists than rightists in general. You can see this in the type of people who generally take media degrees and pursue a career in media - they are mostly not Tory types.  So I'd expect the BBC to be less Tory than average, based on the combined effect over these 4 things. But you are probably right about the split between management and other staff, because that is usually (but not always!) the case."
ukipparty,3d97wh,the-tominator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:39 2015 UTC,"I would say my evidence is only from what I've experienced as I work in the organisation myself. It's possible things would be spread differently across other parts if I went there.  That being said, while I'm Welsh myself the vast majority of people I've come across, especially in Salford are a mixture between Londoners and other English people. I don't tend to see an awful lot of Welsh around in Salford.  In London, most of the people I've seen are people who have lived in the London area. In Cardiff on the other hand, practically everybody is Welsh(unsurprisingly)  Your points are taken though, the BBC is a fan of diversity and will be very happy to employ people from other countries, but they do seem to be willing to turn them down if others are better. As you said with media, there are a lot of left-wing people but sometimes I don't know how somebody is oriented, it's quite possible there are a lot more right-wing people who stay quiet about it inside the BBC.  If you want to know any more info, let me know.  Happy cake day btw."

Elliott could also have sent me a pre-publication review copy, and invited comments - which I would have given him, if asked. But he chose not to ask. Now he has published the work and it is in the public domain, where debate is invited. So debate there shall be.  That said, there is a lot of information in this book, some of it good. And, for those who understand enough to separate the wheat from the chaff, there is some useful information. Unfortunately, there are many errors, some highly flawed and dubious assumptions, and a tinge of unwholesome hubris which drastically reduces the value of this first edition.  Unlike Flexcit, from which this work clearly borrows, the authors could not resist the temptation of dismissing everyone else's work on how to leave the EU, coming up with their own unique ""plan"" and grandly declaring it, and it alone, to be ""optimal""."

It should be conceded at once that leaving the EU would not automatically guarantee lower migration.  As a group of Business for Britain authors pointed out recently, EEA members, such as Norway and Iceland, have also signed up to free movement: “should the UK seek to retain the EEA’s access to the European Single Market, in all likelihood this means little substantial reform of the EU’s free movement rights for the UK,” they wrote.  However, they went on to say that coming to a new arrangement with the EU that would qualify or exclude the principle of free movement would be “politically tricky, but not impossible”.   Framing The False Choice Referendum as:-  Reform Fudge (immigration + Political I.O.U's) vs Brexit FUD  The immigration is merely x1 policy where BREXIT = ""Withdrawal From Political Union (EU)""  Nothing more! Don't take your eye off the ball.  As for the BS little picture that the Conservatives spew out:- This one is so much better:-  EU-Pacman eats British Sovereignty"

Anyway, having been angrily obsessing over it all day, I've decided to alert these delightful people to the sickening Numeric Discrimination which it appears is going on at their once proud university. (Part of me thinks they really would take it seriously in some way if I did...)  My research indicates that of the several departments which deal with numbers, all (all!) are clinging to the Stone Age myth that some numbers are greater than others, when of course the Truth By Emotion is that all numbers are absolutely equal, and are just different to each other. If some numbers appear greater than others than that is solely the fault of white men being shits, which of course they are 24/7.  I have emailed the feminazis (and copied the NUS) suggesting that they demand the elimination of the fascist symbols "">"" and ""<"" from all course materials by October, replacing them with ""="". Any academic who questions this or tries to bring hateful ""objective fact"" into it will of course be sacked for a harmless joke they told decades ago. I'm getting pretty sick of these arrogant ""some answers are right and others are wrong, regardless of how you feel"" types.  And if scientific experiments suddenly start failing or resulting in large bangs etc then that will not be the fault of the change, it'll be because of continued prejudice from fascist white males who won't accept progress, and because wounds have not yet fully healed from the long, painful, devastating history of Numeric Discrimination. I am convinced that if we persevere and believe in equality then everything will eventually be all fine and empowering.  Yay! Email sent! Derail the Hate Train! Numeric Relativism FTW!"

People over here feel completely disconnected with politicians, they can't trust any of them because they also seem to break all their good promises but keep all the bad ones.  I (as someone who has moved into the upper middle class from the working class) don't think any of those politicians can be trusted in Westminster.  They certainly do not represent anyone.  I've never met anyone who isn't a student who is in favour of mass immigration which Labour seems to fantasise about and a lot of people don't actually buy into a lot of the PC bullshit.    The only way Labour can win again is if they stop appealing to 'muh poor immigrants' and 'muh poor minorities' and go back to their working class roots and be the party of the working man again, have the values of the working man and the opinions of the working man.  UKIP on social issues represents the majority of people I've met in the area where I grew up in.  Of course, working class people are generally suspicious of capitalism so I wouldn't say they agree so much with UKIP economically.  But unfortunately, I don't think Labour will ever be the party of the working class in reality ever again.  There are certainly no one in the Labour leadership contest who could connect with the everyday person, they all seem like drones.  tl;dr be the party of the working man  edit: I noticed I did not answer the ""Do you think UKIP represent your views or is it a single issue protest?"" question so I will address it now.  I don't agree with UKIP on a lot of issues (ie drugs) and some things I don't think they go far enough (I'm in favour of less regulation on guns and a lot less economic regulation).  I am a libertarian which is a rare breed in the UK.  I see (or hope) UKIP as some sort of gateway into a more diverse political landscape in which perhaps there are many more parties and that everyone's views are taken into consideration rather than just having two dead parties like we do now.  UKIP today, Libertarian Party tomorrow? Who knows."

ukipparty,3d58tz,Zanza_N,6,Mon Jul 13 17:01:28 2015 UTC,I think it should always remain free at the point of use and they should use whatever mix of private and public services is best for the quality of the NHS whilst not making it too expensive. Obviously I'd rather UKIP took my stance on this than they didn't but it isn't a hugely important issue to me.
ukipparty,3d58tz,banter_lad_m8,3,Mon Jul 13 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"My view on the NHS is unfortunately an unpopular one, I believe that while a government can and should spend some money on health, it shouldn't force a monopoly on healthcare with the way the NHS does.   If the NHS was private, we would have more money from the reduced taxes and an easier way to choose where to get your healthcare from.  I think a model similar to the Netherlands where health insurance is compulsory but the price is regulated to make it affordable.  Another option would be to introduce health credits to allow competition or even just keeping the NHS nationalised but charging patients for some things which could easily be operated by competitors.  However, I don't think UKIP should endeavour to privatise the NHS or take up my stance for multiple reasons, first off because it would be complete and utter electoral suicide and secondly because our system is currently too reliant on the NHS."
ukipparty,3d58tz,tusksrus,4,Mon Jul 13 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"If the NHS was private, we would have more money from the reduced taxes and an easier way to choose where to get your healthcare from.   It should be noted that this applies to richer people more than poorer people, as the richer people pay more tax. Indeed, many people pay no income tax at all and broadly contribute through VAT on the luxuries they can afford. Very unlikely that they'd be any better off. Raising the threshold to £10k only saved a few hundred pounds. Given that that money would not all be spent on private healthcare (it tends to go to things like debt and feeding children), it could amount to simply reducing the quality of care for the poorest. To what end? Reducing taxes? Increasing the choice for richer people? If nothing else it would probably damage the economy because of how much poorer our health becomes as a country.  If it's about choice, consider that it could change the choice of the poor from seeing their doctor or not, to only having the option of not."
ukipparty,3d58tz,arranft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:13 2015 UTC,"Well 25% of all taxes goes towards the NHS so VAT could be dropped from 20% to 15% easily or it could be eliminated altogether, which would benefit everyone even the homeless and kids that still have to buy things in shops.  The concept of the NHS is awesome but for the NHS to work you need a responsible population. One that we clearly don't have. A lot of injuries are avoidable and a lot of health problems caused by bad habits are avoidable. I'm 22 and I don't believe I've ever been in a hospital, I've only been to my doctors about 10 times in my life, so I've cost the NHS very little, yet what Farage got so heavily booed for, there are people coming here with HIV and getting £25,000/year drugs.  The NHS needs to stop spending so much money on drugs. Drugs are so damn expensive it'd be cheaper for the NHS to employ thousands of scientists and invent all these drugs themselves. The NHS is too inefficient and the amount that some people (and the amount of useless bureaucrats) are being paid is just disgusting.  Also, a quick way we can solve the doctor shortage which I realised from watching ""GP's behind closed doors"" was how you have to see your doctor for simple stuff that a nurse could easily deal with for a fraction of the price and pass anything they're not 100% on to a doctor. For example when a family came in about their son never needing to go to the toilet: EAT SOME FIBRE. Doesn't take a doctor or even a nurse to solve that one, yet a doctor that gets paid £££??? is having to deal with that, that is inefficient."
ukipparty,3d58tz,ahnjoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:38:36 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives in the US, I just wanted to ask a quick question.  As someone who lives in a country where the cost of healthcare is a joke, the NHS does sound really appealing to me, but I was just curious about the quality of the healthcare. I'm not really sure how things work over there, but if healthcare is free, how do they keep the quality of the healthcare up? What drives the ""free"" healthcare clinics to maintain there quality? What motivates them?"
ukipparty,3d58tz,RichieSM,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"The healthcare is a bit better in the US (no long waiting lists for surgery etc). However, our private care is basically the same as yours and usually covered by insurance provided by our employers. The costs aren't insane as over there though.  As for the quality staying relatively good while still being free - it's not actually free at all. Everyone in the UK pays taxes which fund the NHS. It's a socialist idea: one day someone in your family or the average Joe down the road might get very ill so you pay taxes to help them out. And vice versa.  I can understand why a lot of the US population would hate the idea of that, being a relatively pseudo-libertarian country, and wouldn't want the government forcing them to pay taxes for a stranger's benefit."

ukipparty,3d192t,YoungIcarus4,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:08:47 2015 UTC,Probably because most polls on that sub (in particular the the run up to the election) tend to be a world away from the results in the country as a whole. That and the fact that most like there get brigaded.

ukipparty,3cyp4a,RichieSM,4,Sat Jul 11 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"I have a few points to make, but they appear to me to be tangential to the main thrust of your post and should perhaps be considered as such.   Could Eastern Europe suffer such a ""brain drain"" that it descends into civil war, driven by poverty and famine?   Brain drain can (and will) be a problem (link provided as one example) for these countries, and whilst I can certainly see it having detrimental economic effects (although it is worth pointing out, just as a sidenote, that Poland seems to have done rather well during and since the global financial crisis), and exacerbating the existing poverty that persists in these countries, I personally can't see it leading to such instability as conflict or a civil war - or I would say it is the least likely case. One has to consider that many of these countries suffered as part of the eastern bloc, the 'revolutions of 1989' and other events associated with the fall of communism, and the unstable transitionary period from communism to capitalism. These all brought radical economic and societal changes but throughout these events, after WW2, there was markedly little conflict - so I see no overwhelming reason to believe that conflict would result from detrimental economic effects caused by mass migration from these countries in recent years. The main exception to this, of course, is the Yugoslav wars, but my view on this is it was largely caused by political factors concerning Yugoslavia, and not economic factors. However this part of europe is certainly not something I am an expert on, so any criticisms of my interpretation of events is more than welcome.   Surely Putin, if he's still around by then, would use that opportunity to expand his empire as we've seen in Ukraine?   Putin taking such an action would be complicated (the verb, not the adjective) for various reasons. The most pressing of these is that nearly all of the countries he could exploit in such a manner would be members of NATO, which Ukraine was not. The two exceptions to this are Belarus and Moldova, who are also not members of the EU anyways. My feeling on this is that Putin (taking into consideration Farage's respect for him as a savvy national leader) is a realist, and whilst he excels at the type of political brinkmanship displayed so well in the Ukraine, he would consider equivalent actions against a member of the EU and/or NATO to be an entirely different ballgame.    What about Turkey? It shares a large border with Syria. They've applied to join the EU, but they're not exactly a model of tolerance and peace. Recently they've become the primary gateway for extremists to join ISIS.   Personally I don't see it as likely that Turkey will join the EU. It has been 28 years since their 'application to accede' to the EEC, 10 years since their application to join the EU, support for joining the EU in Turkey has dropped massively, there are many questionable aspects of Turkey's body politic (which make it less likely they will fit the criteria for joining the EU), and this body politic itself seems to be shifting towards the view that joining the EU is, if not contrary to their goals, at least a low priority for them.   edit: a few minor edits on grammar and small points"

We all agree that Norway is doing spectacularly well but there are probably quite a lot of people over on /r/unitedkingdom (and even ukpolitics, which is more suitable) who are not aware of this at all.  I know posting there invites downvotes, but karma is just useless internet points anyway."

I do not have ""permission"" to post over at r united kingdom nor ukpolitics as there's censorship at reddit.  I try to post previously and they disappear without a trace.  I post here for a number of reasons, one of which that even details such as EFTA, EEA, Article 50, Brexit, UNECE seem little appreciated or well known even amongst Anti-EU supporters..."

ukipparty,3cw4zs,Paludosa2,2,Sat Jul 11 07:21:19 2015 UTC,"Rarely am I in a place where I don't quite know my own mind on something. One thing I dislike about our media is the propensity to dip in and out of subjects without any continuity and expect to be able to report something in substantive detail when it crops up again. Hence why when something becomes a thing, I keep an eye on it. One thing that won't go away any time soon is the vexed question of Ukraine.  It's fashionable in the SW1 claque to blame everything on Putin and even mainstream Tories praise the EU for ""consolidating democracy"" and making Eastern Europe wealthier. The problem is that I don't trust them. These are the same ilk who wilfully took Greece into the Euro knowing what shape it was in.   Truly said."
