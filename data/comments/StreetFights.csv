StreetFights,3e2zcd,Danny_Zoe,11,Tue Jul 21 16:38:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I always like seeing kicks thrown in street fights. You never see that.
StreetFights,3e2zcd,Chrisbrown762,8,Tue Jul 21 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they were both getting some good shots in. It seems like the Hawaiian fighting culture is pretty fair.

StreetFights,3e2zcd,andee510,4,Tue Jul 21 18:06:47 2015 UTC,It's because fighting is a part of their culture as an honest way to settle any disrespect.   Surfers fight all the time about stolen waves
StreetFights,3e2zcd,I_dont_like_you_much,8,Tue Jul 21 18:41:50 2015 UTC,Hawaii has surfers. They fight over stolen waves.   Cali has surfers. They fight over stolen waves.  Whats your point brah.
StreetFights,3e2zcd,I_dont_like_you_much,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:32 2015 UTC,Agreed.  fight was pretty clean; i liked how they waited for eachother to get back to their feet before resuming.  the crowd was pretty well-behaved as well.

StreetFights,3e2zcd,DerpHarry,-19,Tue Jul 21 22:43:14 2015 UTC,This fight was way too long.  I dont understand what was going on here.  I know they arent trained.  Or at least it didnt look like it.  It was like watching a girl fight with no knock out power and no one yelling SSSSTTTTAAAAHHHHHHHPPPP!!!    But hey at least it wasnt on cement.  I am ready for the down votes
StreetFights,3e2zcd,bryanrobh,15,Tue Jul 21 17:30:11 2015 UTC,The fight lasted a while because you're too used to watching thugs sucker punching/tackling an unsuspecting opponent and bashing their head against cement. The video OP posted is an actual fight.
StreetFights,3e2zcd,Archangellelilstumpz,-10,Tue Jul 21 18:03:21 2015 UTC,All of what you just said was true.  The problem in this fight is both of those guys were weak punchers.  The one good shot at the end didnt even hurt the guy.
StreetFights,3e2zcd,bryanrobh,6,Tue Jul 21 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"That's because it was a fight to settle a disagreement rather than a fight for survival. I wouldn't call this a street fight, but for I know, this is the only sub suitable for it."
StreetFights,3e2zcd,Baked_Otter,0,Tue Jul 21 18:17:51 2015 UTC,So you are saying they were pulling punches because it was a disagreement?
StreetFights,3e2zcd,bryanrobh,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"Essentially, yes. I don't believe either one wanted to knock the other guy out, just rough 'em up a bit. They shook hands after everything was settled."

StreetFights,3dzcke,Goldsound,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:28:03 2015 UTC,Oh yeah the nose would be a good target too. I've seen this exact same thing happen though with two friends where the smaller one tried headbutting the taller one and because of the angle he pretty much drove his forehead straight into his teeth. It look like he had literally taken a bite out of his forehead. I would take nose>forehead>teeth.
StreetFights,3dzcke,ZangTumbTumb,4,Tue Jul 21 07:35:16 2015 UTC,Forehead to forehead is a great way to go if you want to make sure you knock yourself out in the process.
StreetFights,3dzcke,Goldsound,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:01:39 2015 UTC,Ehhh maybe if the other guy braces for it and headbutts you back. But if he is not anticipating it and you just drive it straight through all the damage is going to him not you.
StreetFights,3dzcke,decemberwolf,0,Tue Jul 21 10:08:46 2015 UTC,...equal and opposite reaction...
StreetFights,3dzcke,Goldsound,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:54:26 2015 UTC,Have a friend hold his hand out in the high five position and throw a punch at it. Then try it again but this time have him brace and push back at the same time you throw the punch. You will see the difference.

StreetFights,3dwanf,Socialdem,12,Mon Jul 20 02:45:06 2015 UTC,yeah i felt sorry for that second guy. the slam his buddy copped (on concrete no less) was brutal enough and could easily fuck up any person. follow up shots were completely unnecessary.  he did the right thing going in to try and stop it. too bad he got fucked up himself though.  great post.
StreetFights,3dwanf,thawrestla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:48:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you. He didn't try to hurt anyone or sucker punch. He tied to save his friend and others should have too. Dude who attacked him is weak AF, he knows it too. Trying to ear respect from his buddy. But doesn't get it"
StreetFights,3dwanf,LexisNexiss,5,Tue Jul 21 01:33:01 2015 UTC,"Seriously, probably got a concussion for saving his probably dead friend.  I never read descriptions. Shit was brutal."
StreetFights,3dwanf,Wok_Slayer,3,Mon Jul 20 07:23:33 2015 UTC,"Probably not dead from that. Knocked out, absolutely, but people can usually take even more punishment than that and still not croak.

StreetFights,3dwanf,jombojuice22,4,Mon Jul 20 20:30:36 2015 UTC,I think it was the way he tried to stop it. It looked aggressive as if he was going to jump the other guy.

StreetFights,3dwanf,HistoryHellion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:51 2015 UTC,It honestly looked like he was stopping over the guy on the ground to me. Different perspectives I guess but its also fucked up that he obviously wasn't trying to fight while putting his shirt back on and the other guy pushed him down again. I can understand how the actions can be seen as aggressive but that one guy is still a douche.

If I'm fighting its because someone attacked me. Not because someone was talking shit, not because someone was posturing up, or whatever other machismo reasoning there is. If you attack me, I'm under the assumption that you're trying to do grievous bodily harm or kill me. I will do whatever I have to do to go home. I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6."

If you're gonna hurt someone because of those things, you're just as ignorant and also have issues.   He'll walk away from this having more hate for them.    And unfortunately you know people will see this and think even worse things about black people.    More often than not, it's possible to work out misunderstandings without violence.  I think it was possible in this situation.  And if people can achieve that, we gain more respect for each other, and we grow into better people and communities as a whole."

Sticking your head out with the hands down is a tactic to have the other guy throw a punch then you slip and counter.

Once someones goes on the ground( top or bottom) they are in the ocean, you are the shark and they have no idea how to swim.  And like you already kind of hinted at BJJ isn't a security blanket to go out thinking you can fightpeople, you can still get knocked the fuck out quickkkkkk.

Do so without taking your eye off of them, period. Not many things are really worth fighting over. Your ""honor"" is never one of those things, ever. Never kick a person while they're down. If they want to end the fight, end it and leave. Never lower your guard until you're far enough away to lower it, no matter what. Even if the fight is supposedly over, don't drop your guard. If you EVER get in a fight with a smaller man, take it serious. Little guys are more dangerous than big guys. I'm 6'4"" and 200 lbs. I fought much more than I should have for a lot of stupid reasons. A little guy is so much more dangerous. If you don't take a little guy serious, he will fuck you up in short order. Fighting a little guy? Throw punches like you're trying to break them. Number 1. is the most important of all of them. Walk away whenever you can. Winning a fight isn't as rewarding as keeping your cool and avoiding it. I know a lot of you are young and won't understand this. I'm older and have too many fights on me and too many years on me.

I agree that battle of the sexes talk is usually nonsense.  Britney Griner, as amazing as she is, would get destroyed in the NBA.  But I really think Ronda stands a chance against Floyd, mostly because of Floyd's size.  Could Floyd one punch her on the way in?  Absolutely.  I'd put even money on it, and not be worried.  But Ronda could just as easily beat Floyd.  If he doesn't connect before she gets a hold of him, that fight is over, and Floyd is gunna be in some serious pain."

StreetFights,3dpeng,drughi1312,7,Mon Jul 20 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"There's a reason that serena williams trains with the #104 ranked man in the world despite being #1 in the women's division- men are much faster and stronger. Yeah, I know we've seen MMA fighters drop boxers- but we've never seen a top boxer in any of those fights. Mayweather is a man who can move much faster than virtually any fighter in either sport right now and hit much harder than anyone rousey has/will ever encounter fighting in a women's mma division.  I'd love to see her kill him, but you can't expect a woman that's slower and smaller to be the one to take him out. She'd prob survive a few punches, maybe reach to grapple- but she'd get caught really fast once she stopped protecting her face. Compare some videos, mayweather moves at practically twice the speed."
StreetFights,3dpeng,rentasupercarforaday,3,Sat Jul 18 07:01:41 2015 UTC,Not to mention Rondas knees are almost gone from decades of Judo. Mayweather would just overwhelm her with speed and precision striking.
StreetFights,3dpeng,Kilfeed_Me,0,Sat Jul 18 13:18:19 2015 UTC,This is true but ronda is the exception to this. Tough as nails but at the same time she hasnt been hit by a woman that hits like a man but i think that she would surprise lots of people. Also street fights are a whole other ball game. Judo on concrete is deadly.

StreetFights,3dpeng,Lj101,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"I guess you haven't met many streetfighters. Fighting on the ground is unrealistic, you NEVER want to be on the ground if you're streetfighting. It can turn very fast from 1v1 to 2v1 if some bystander sees you laying on the floor choking his friend, and then you're fucked. Streetfighting is about position, speed and power. If you drop 2 guys in a row with a hook if they try to come closer, the other guys will probably already give up. I have streetfighting, casual fighting, hooligan fights, muay thai and boxing experience and you guys are just naive if you think Floyd would ever let Ronda come within takedown distance. He's much faster and hits twice as hard as any ufc woman will ever hit. Stop dreaming."
StreetFights,3dpeng,drughi1312,2,Sat Jul 18 18:26:33 2015 UTC,If we're going to allow 2v1s then the hypothetical fight is just silly. I could say that Ronda hired a gang of armed thugs to help her. We're talking about a 1v1 clearly.

StreetFights,3dpeng,Human_Evolution,4,Sat Jul 18 05:11:47 2015 UTC,She could not properly absorb the shock of a punch from the best boxer in the world. One solid jab straight combo and it would be lights out.

StreetFights,3dpeng,TyroneBiggums93,7,Sat Jul 18 14:59:35 2015 UTC,People in this sub are delusional. Mayweather would KO Ronda inside 30 seconds.
StreetFights,3dpeng,Kilfeed_Me,-3,Sat Jul 18 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. Whoever made that assumption is stupid for doing so. I'm glad I did not assume that. We will never know who would win because they will likely never fight. All we can do is look at the past to help predict the future but that is highly flawed. I'd put money on Ronda after seeing guys who were strictly boxers get dominated on the ground. I don't think the male female comparison is a huge deal. Usually when someone has no experience with takedown defense they get taken down, when they are down they often tap. I've watched UFC since UFC 1, that is what I am basing my words on."
StreetFights,3dpeng,Human_Evolution,2,Sat Jul 18 19:09:58 2015 UTC,It's happened like twice with washed up turd boxers. Prime Tyson would fuck any current heavyweight ufc fighter up if he trained a little bit for ufc.

StreetFights,3dpeng,Human_Evolution,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:22:19 2015 UTC,True but Ronda doesn't know anything about that hand speed or footwork fighting UFC girls. Goddamn I hate that fucking Mayweather though.

StreetFights,3dpeng,Arkansan13,3,Tue Jul 21 01:29:48 2015 UTC,Rousey won't even move up in weight to fight another woman (Cyborg) yet she is going to easily take out the #1 P4P male boxer in the world?  You guys are fucking delusional.
StreetFights,3dpeng,thegrayman,5,Sat Jul 18 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"Mayweather has super quick footwork and could easily dodge her maneuver, plus he has no gloves on, one solid hit to the jaw and she is done. It would be over in less than 10 seconds."
StreetFights,3dpeng,FNX45,0,Sat Jul 18 12:42:39 2015 UTC,More like he would clinch up with her if they get real close (because thats what boxers do) and she would slam his ass on the pavement.
StreetFights,3dpeng,bosnianbeatdown,-8,Sat Jul 18 04:29:33 2015 UTC,She can take a hit if she survives the first hit his hand is broken. He breaks his hands with gloves so without them he will break his hands. After that first hit if she is still up then the judo comes out and he is done.
StreetFights,3dpeng,priest19843,4,Sat Jul 18 19:53:58 2015 UTC,lol what
StreetFights,3dpeng,parablooper,-3,Sat Jul 18 05:08:16 2015 UTC,People without fight experience talking about what they dont know. Mayweather is a glorified dancer at this age. His hands break every fight and when you are bare knuckle your hands break even faster. Fact. She stays awake after one punch he is on his head knocked out. Judo will really hurt you in a street fight and she is way better than most people give her credit. He is also close to ten years older then her.
StreetFights,3dpeng,priest19843,4,Sat Jul 18 08:04:44 2015 UTC,Mayweather would take her head off.
StreetFights,3dpeng,thegrayman,2,Sat Jul 18 08:20:09 2015 UTC,If we look at how boxers entering the UFC have panned out in the past Ronda has a huge advantage. Boxing is very limited.

StreetFights,3dpeng,thegrayman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:01:49 2015 UTC,Good question. I'd be interested to see that in the UFC but it goes against our cultural norms. Maybe when we are old it will happen and they'll say we were sexist for not letting girls fight boys.
StreetFights,3dpeng,Human_Evolution,2,Sat Jul 18 11:26:54 2015 UTC,"Yes grapplers do have an advantage, but it's not like the UFC has ever brought in a top tier boxer who wasn't over the hill and overweight.  Floyd Mayweather may be aging a bit but he's not washed up, he's also a defensive genius with some of the best footwork of this generation. If you don't think footwork can be used to avoid a shot your mistaken, besides that Floyd isn't stupid he's not going to clinch with her given her background.   Would she win? She has a better shot than many, but let's not act like she wouldn't have to be careful about it or like it would be some cakewalk."

StreetFights,3dpeng,TaftintheTub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:14:37 2015 UTC,Hehe yeah. Boxers can get the KO. There's a huge advantage there but I say the ground game has the advantage on the ground and most ground fighters can take an inexperienced ground fighter down.

StreetFights,3dpeng,SpyDad24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:33 2015 UTC,"The only people saying mayweather would win don't even give him credit for his boxing, they just think he'll win because he's a male."
StreetFights,3dpeng,Sychar,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:48:06 2015 UTC,"Okay. First of all, your question is regarding a street fight scenario.   There's three things that everyone in here, that probably aren't big into MMA or boxing don't realize.    When Ronda is not cutting weight, she is EASILY 150 pounds or more. She is absolutely beast mode for a woman and anyone that thinks otherwise is INSANE. This is not your wife, this is not your mom, this is not the girl at the gym that you think about when you whack it, this is a KILLER of a woman, seriously, she could kill you more easily with her bare hands than a lot of men could with a weapon. Floyd would more than likely have on a shirt that is very conducive to judo throws, trips, and overall body manipulation. He wears fancy clothes, typically a jacket or a shirt with a collar. These would both aid Rousey greatly.  Floyd has NO grappling experience, absolutely ZERO grappling experience. ZERO. Ronda is an OLYMPIC MEDALIST in JUDO and is one of, if not the best, woman grappler in the world right now.    You all really have no idea what it's like being in there with someone that is such a high level of a grappler. I have 10+ years of wrestling experience, a lot of that is Greco Roman competition and Rousey would TOY me and I am a 200 lb guy. I am no Floyd Mayweather on my feet but he doesn't have the power, nor the strength to stop Rousey in one punch or stop the takedown.  His style is incredibly easy to use against him in this scenario. As others have said, if he even thinks about clinching he is going for a ride and will immediately be tapped out incapacitated (forgot this was a street fight scenario). If he plans on just dancing and never being touched, hopefully he can and hopefully it's just a big wide open field for hundreds of yards."
StreetFights,3dpeng,kizzzzurt,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:39:02 2015 UTC,""" seriously, she could kill you more easily with her bare hands than a lot of men could with a weapon""  Just pay her a bit of cash, have her suck you off, and rethink what you just wrote."
StreetFights,3dpeng,kizzzzurt,3,Sat Jul 18 11:27:32 2015 UTC,"Right on, but considering the average male actually doesn't know anything about fighting and she knows who knows how many ways to choke you out in your stupid hoodie, keep thinking that because she's a woman she isn't shit."
StreetFights,3dpeng,CristianoRealnaldo,-5,Sat Jul 18 12:04:02 2015 UTC,"I think I saw a video of Rousey in a fight against some no name mma fighter, and she got destroyed. I think the male/female professional fighter gap might be too much for her to overcome"

StreetFights,3dgacr,SpixIO,3,Thu Jul 16 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know all too well how hard a good TKD guy can kick, I used to have to spar against them in Muay Thai class. Even still, just one discipline of fighting like that doesn't necessarily translate to an insta-win. Even Joe Rogan said that when he first started taking kick boxing classes he was getting wrecked by average kickboxers because his hands were bad - and he was a world class TKD guy.  I'm not saying TKD or Karate are completely useless, I'm just saying a black belt in TKD or Karate is significantly less likely to win you a street fight than a black belt in BJJ or even a few months of multi-disciplinary MMA classes."

Now if I am sucker punched, I don't know you, and I can legally defend myself these pitfalls are avoided. I am only responding to what has been unjustly done to me. An acquaintance of mine awhile back was sucker punched and his response was to stab that guy to death in a crowded mall. He won that case as he claimed he feared for his life. In that case he did know the person it was a known gang member. You should not sucker punch people. There are people armed just waiting for some dumb ass to try that knockout game on one of them.

StreetFights,3dcw7j,Fishwhistling,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"It's not difficult. I dunno exactly what your physique is but practically anyone can throw a head kick if they stretch out their legs every day (try to do a full split everyday untill you feel like crying) as well as developing power in your legs, Squats leg presses whatever it takes. Next you have to get the footwork down. You'll find the easiest kicks are front kicks and roundhouses. You'll need to learned how to pivot of the balls of your feet but if you watch a few videos and with practice it will come to you. Combine it all and kick a heavy bag a few thousand times and you'll have yourself a kick or two you feel comfortable with throwing."

One day we ran out of booze and decided it'd be bloody good idea to go for a bike ride to the nearest pub. There were 4 of us: American, Brit, and two Russians. One our way back with hands full of vodka, red bull, whiskey, and other random stuff a kid from New York accidentally pulled front brake, instead of back. He did the most beautiful and graceful flip I had ever seen and slammed forehead first into the concrete. The noise wasn't just a thud, but a thunderous crunch. We seriously thought that was it for him.   Somehow he only had a small gash on his forehead, the only major damage was done to the jeans and scrapped knees. What's even more miraculous both bottles of vodka survived too. He tucked them underneath himself as he swan dived into the concrete. Later in the evening he was given an un-official Russian citizenship. :)"

If beating up a drunk kid standing there with his hands down is your idea of self defense then well done.

StreetFights,3dawy4,Dirtydirtdirtt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:05:01 2015 UTC,said no one ever...  its all about fresh bread and sweet bay and dixie have the worst bread/bakeries
StreetFights,3dawy4,Dirtydirtdirtt,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"Thats why this its an opinion, and somebody downvoted me for mine, which isn't what downvoting is for.   A sandwich  mostly about the meat and vegetables. All of these stores offer Boars head (well sweet bay did),So you really can't say one has better meat when they offer the same kind. Winn dixie offer's more vegetables and condiments than publix from my experience.  You can argue that publix vegetables are higher quality but your point would be moot because unless you are purchasing organic , they are pretty much going to be the same. I am going to hedge my bet that publix doesn't use expensive organic vegetables in their subs.   Publix does offer hot sandwiches though, so I will give them that. But If i am going to eat a Philly, I am going to go to Delco's or another good Philly place.  Its kind of like buying a steak from Applebees.   While I agree with you that the bread is important part, its definitely not the single most important part. From my experience, winn dixie and sweetbay (when it was around) had pretty decent bread. Flakey on the outside, soft in the middle, pretty much the two things I expect of sandwich bread . Spicing up bread w/ different herbs and cheese is just to hide the fact that its shitty bread.   Winn Dixie offers the lower price, the larger portion and more ingredients than the competitor in my opinion.  The quality is going to vary from store to store, just like at any store, including publix.  Then again, I am one of those people that boycott anything to do w/ Publix and think it has become a giant monopoly on the grocery industry here in Florida. I also think there deals are phoney, everything is overpriced."

I'd wager that the skater kids were being punks and maybe bumped a smaller kid or said something inappropriate to a smaller kid, the dude decided to say something and he said something he shouldn't have said and then he was dealt a blow to the head he didn't deserve by a kid that has no concept of the damage he could do with a hit like that. i hung out with punk kids on our bikes and skateboards and we had altercations with dudes like this guy but even the dumbest of the dudes in my crew wasn't stupid enough to hit a guy with his skateboard. one guy came close but realized what a bad idea it is to blindside someone with basically what would be legally considered a weapon."

Man ""Don't hit my son... stop hitting my son right?""  Boy ""Oh it doesn't matter you stop calling a f**ing 12 year old a piece of sht.""   Man ""So who the f*ck is this to you huh?   Boy ""Get a life. Go away.""  Man ""Shuddup you f*cking little maggot...  Boy ""UURRMAAHGERD""  Man ""do..."" SMACK  So it sounds to me like the group may have been picking on the man's son, or skating wrecklessly and bumping into him and he was trying to sort them out."
StreetFights,3d8ldu,InspiredRichard,3,Wed Jul 15 07:42:57 2015 UTC,"nope, it sounds like this kid called out the older guy on calling a kid a ""piece of shit"", and thought it was the older guy's son. the older guy says ""that kid aint my son"" and thats when the kid says ""oh it doesnt matter"""

People will walk from house to house attending parties.  So, people aren't necessarily there to hang out on the beach but cruise Newport and might just end up on the beach to hangout with friends.  Hence, the clothing can be mixed between casual street clothes and beachwear.    4th of July in Newport Beach draws people from all over Southern California.  Newport Beach typically has attractive, healthy, and wealthy citizens being one of the most desired area codes in California.  These troglodytes most likely ventured forth from a far flung cave.  I avoid this place like the plague on 4th of July weekend.  Otherwise, it's a fun town any other time.  Has a pretty serious spot called the Wedge for the adventurous.  Definitely not for the feint of heart."

Washington State law ( this was in Seattle ) allows for mutual combat between two consenting adults as long as fair play rules are established, e.g. agreeing on a point when to call the fight, agreeing to no biting, eye gouging. The law allowed this, not the police, they just were there and knew the law and allowed it to proceed."
StreetFights,3d81e3,OneEyedGambler_WOT,13,Tue Jul 14 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"and allowed it to proceed.   So, they allowed it.  Mutual combat is legal but the cops are in no way obligated to let it go down, especially on public property, or if there is risk to a bystander or another person's property (which there obviously was).  The cops could have stopped this fight from happening and it would have been totally above board. They allowed it.  Edit: It is also not a state law that allows this, it's a Seattle municipal code."

StreetFights,3d0rbe,Empyrealist,3,Sun Jul 12 20:46:07 2015 UTC,That walk off.
StreetFights,3d0rbe,onyxsamurai,7,Mon Jul 13 00:40:03 2015 UTC,Is this assault by the black guy? Or can you legally hit someone who is verbally harassing you?
StreetFights,3d0rbe,checkyos3lf,11,Sun Jul 12 19:30:47 2015 UTC,The guy showed all the body language he was about to hit him and the victim tried to back out physically and verbally.  I guess the laws vary but I assume he would get off more than not.  You shouldn't have to wait until someone hits you to end a confrontation.
StreetFights,3d0rbe,vagina_fang,3,Sun Jul 12 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, just wondering if that does hold up in court."
StreetFights,3d0rbe,checkyos3lf,6,Sun Jul 12 21:25:33 2015 UTC,Would a reasonable person fear for their safety/think they could be attacked over that behavior to where self defense is needed?    I think so.
StreetFights,3d0rbe,Bradddtheimpaler,3,Mon Jul 13 01:20:47 2015 UTC,"The fact that he was trying to leave and the guy was following him probably helps.  Also, a verbal threat counts as assault most places.  Couldn't tell what he said, but if he threatened him, then technically the kid who through the punches had been ""assaulted."""
StreetFights,3d0rbe,maccabeus,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"it was actually assault by the white guy.  assault is the explicit threat of violence, so it can be verbal or physical, or in this case both.  If the black guy had shot him, there would be a case, but using your bare hands to defend yourself wouldn't get him in trouble in anything but the most crooked courts."

StreetFights,3d0rbe,R_EYE_P,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:08:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.   Everyone thinks the other guy is in the wrong.   The best thing you can do when stealing shit is act casual as hell about it like you're doing nothing wrong.   I used to steal beer all the time from grocery stores when I was a kid.   Just fill my cart up and casually walk away.   I even did it right in front of a security guard once
StreetFights,3d0rbe,mwrex,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:49:00 2015 UTC,True

StreetFights,3d0rbe,ChubbieRooster,13,Sun Jul 12 18:38:31 2015 UTC,I willing to bet it was based on him being black.
StreetFights,3d0rbe,TrepanationBy45,-7,Sun Jul 12 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"That's either projecting, or you've just arbitrarily decided that somebody is racist. That's a dangerously irrational way to reason."

StreetFights,3d1byh,TheTexasWarrior,10,Mon Jul 13 00:33:03 2015 UTC,Did anyone actually throw a punch? All I saw were flailing arms. The best was when he started spinning with his arms out and managed to hit someone in the face.
StreetFights,3d1byh,toboggan_mantis_md,4,Mon Jul 13 02:54:15 2015 UTC,Did you see the spinning punch tho?

StreetFights,3d1byh,TexasVendee,2,Tue Jul 14 03:12:47 2015 UTC,A fabulous beating...
StreetFights,3d1byh,SupremeNeckProtector,2,Tue Jul 14 03:20:59 2015 UTC,Dude in the white stripped polo did everything besides fight the guy they were fighting. In the beginning after he gets up off the floor he throws one punch and it just bounces off the guy. He just postures and backs up after that to give the illusion that he was fighting people.
StreetFights,3d1byh,smashbro713,3,Mon Jul 13 21:16:21 2015 UTC,Which one is the bouncer?

StreetFights,3d1byh,tonydiamondmia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"He punched someone who wasn't looking, he never took anyone on head up. On top of that he had to pull out a tire iron, because if sucker punching someone wasn't enough let me pull a weapon when everyone is throwing hands. The Ko was the real cheap shot."
StreetFights,3d1byh,EternalEight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:58:35 2015 UTC,He also sucker punched and was responsible for the only knockout in the vid.

StreetFights,3cy5gu,Wuzz,4,Sun Jul 12 00:44:54 2015 UTC,I liked the whole video and was pleased with the music. In the future feel free to mute the video or just shut up.
StreetFights,3cy5gu,ThickPrick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:30:13 2015 UTC,"I was going to say it's one of the best comps I've seen posted. Most are unedited, full videos back to back of random people getting their ass kicked, with a title of ""Bullies get what they deserve!"" I've seen some with obviously fake videos in the mix.   This video stayed on topic, and edited to the actual fights. Not bad as far as comps go. Though I could do without the music."

That equality also reaches to a victim trying to defend himself from an attacker. Gender has nothing to do with self defense. Stopping bodily harm from ones self sees no gender. We need to stop this double standard that women are weaker than men, so they should never be hit. In fact, no one should be hitting other people, unless they are defending self or property. A woman can do just as much physical damage to a person as a man, and sometimes force is the only way to immediately prevent harm."

StreetFights,3cuugv,RussWestbrook,15,Sat Jul 11 12:45:49 2015 UTC,"That's funny, because there's no need for a woman to get violent with a man. Had she said her peace and walked away, she wouldn't be a limp, half-conscious, bloodied, sobbing mess.   It may be a strange concept to you, but no human has the right to physically assault any person for any reason, and if they do the assaulted has a right to defend themselves regardless of sex.   He also doesn't owe her a bear hug or any soft ways of calming her down while she slaps and claws at him. I say fuck her. Any woman or man who wants to pick a physical fight can catch a full force right hook to the mouth. If that's an intolerable outcome, assaulting others isn't advised."

StreetFights,3csc22,zxcv73,16,Fri Jul 10 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"At my jujitsu school, we do drill multiple foes every other week or so. Usually in groups of two or three. I've been hit lots of times, but if you manage distance well enough and keep yourself out of the center, it's similar to one on one.  Lateral movements are important, and keep yourself in motion. Its great training and I've never had to use it, but that's another skill entirely.   There's a sense of false confidence instilled in those who attack in groups. But preventing the group from surrounding you prevents  that danger. And that confidence becomes a disadvantage"
StreetFights,3csc22,DarkAvenger2012,3,Fri Jul 10 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"We did that in my old JJ school also.  One thing that people don't consider is that it's exhausting!  You constantly have to move and there are a LOT of decisions to make.  It's important to keep your head and to keep breathing.  A funny thing about X-on-1 scenarios is that a lot of the time there's no communication in the attacking group.  It seems weird to actually shout out instructions to your team (and it would be even weirder on the street) but it's effective.  If attackers don't coordinate, well, it looks like those kids in the video.  If you want to get the single guy good, just have everybody grab him and drag him to the floor."
StreetFights,3csc22,Plutoid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:43:35 2015 UTC,"Well when you are doing the drill and allowed to throw punches or kicks, grabbing someone becomes more of a challenge."
StreetFights,3csc22,zxcv73,2,Sun Jul 12 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  You can set up your takedown with strikes just as surely as they can defend your takedowns with strikes.  The thing is, positions that are neutral in 1 vs 1 fights are not neutral in X-on-1.  If you get in an over/under clinch, yes, you're controlling the other guy but at the same time you're giving up all of your mobility - which is the most critical aspect of this scenario.  This is NOT hard to achieve when striking is an option.  So I don't have to actually put a guy on the floor myself to ensure that he ultimately gets taken down.  My buddy or buddies wrap his legs and we hit the floor.    2-on-1 grappling on the floor is extremely difficult.  3 or more would be a nightmare; pretty much a lost cause unless you're fighting people that you completely outclass in both strength and skill."

It's almost becoming common knowledge as well. Reason why it cost so much is because they have to go through a very intensive court process (meaning more of your tax money) to be sure that that person deserves to be executed.

The system isn't broken, its like that in case someone is innocent. There have been cases where people have been put in jail or executed only to find out that they were innocent later. With jail, they can live their life again, with the death penalty, its over. It is more moral to have a few criminals avoid the death penalty (they still suffer jail time) while having innocents live, compared to just killing everybody who we deem is suitable."

The legal system is fucked up for a lot of reasons and the nightmare of being falsely accused and getting the death penalty is, in my mind, the number one argument against capital punishment.  It just annoys the shit out of me thinking that tax money is going to keeping these guys alive or funding more liberal hogwash psychotherapy that has miserable success rates.

People who are charged with sex crimes (mainly child related) are usually put in segregated population, to keep the other inmates from beating/killing them.  While in jail they get 3 hots and a cot, and more than likely cable tv.  Though he would be a registered sex offender for life, thats pretty much the only thing turning him into the cops will accomplish.  Fear that you may actually lose your life, will on the other hand straighten the worst piece of shit out.  What they need to do is give him follow up visit to keep his memory fresh, or send a greeting card in the mail just to keep him on his toes."

We like to think prison is some nightmare for sex offenders, or that they'll be in there for ages, or what have. The truth is it's not that much harder on them and often the sentencing is a slap on the wrist unless they did something truly unspeakable.  Shit in the town I graduated high school from a child molester got a paltry three years and only served two.   I've seen a guy damn near kill one of my brothers over nothing. Multiple brain surgeries, leg surgeries, medically induced coma the whole nine yards. Zero time served, none, dude got probation.  The ""justice"" system in this country doesn't fix a fucking thing, at best they get a time out at worst they come out a bit smarter and with some connections.

Seriously it's one thing to be told but learning to do it is a whole different ball of wax.  But as to the correct way to deal with it, it just depends on what your skill set is. If you have a strong grappling base you'd want to shoot or crash to clinch so you could put them down.  If you're striking your best bet is to jab your way into range and go for whatever opens itself. If you have a decent amount of training just jabbing your way in will throw most guys with no training off. It keeps them busy and puts an obstacle in the way they have to work around, typically gets them backing up as well. If you have enough training to accomplish this you likely have enough not to work up much of a sweat fighting some random off the street."

Also he should have made his ankles touch each other, I did see a grapevine for a bit, but I think that's a better position.  So if the guy on the bottom tries to ""buck him off"", he is just bucking air, not his opponents hips (thus knocking him off balance).  OMG..... I hate the women immediately going ""stand it back up"". Look if the guy can't get out of mount or any other ground position, then he shouldn't get into any fight period. Even if the rules agreed to prior where ""standing up only with/without kicks"". Some fights go to the ground with those rules, and people shouldn't jump in.  TLDR: know ground or don't fight."

Guy on top definitely knew how to do ground work, it may not be the best display of BJJ because any wrestler can hold mount and rain down punches, but he had good ground control regardless and was much stronger than the other guy.  I personally would attest to his BJJ because of his breathing and expressions when punching on the ground. No overly crazy swings, stays tight, strong, and methodical when punching the other guys face in."

StreetFights,3ce7vu,Windex1211,2,Tue Jul 7 10:38:00 2015 UTC,Well he is now kicked off the team..
StreetFights,3ce7vu,Nelmsdog,3,Wed Jul 8 22:23:12 2015 UTC,Nope. It's wrong .... no one should ever hit another person ... and he CLEARLY tried to hold her arms when she got aggressive ... if you throw a punch .. male or female ... you deserve to get punched back as a means of defense.  He could have destroyed that bitch but instead he hit her and walked away from the problem.  I give him props for not hitting her multiple times.
StreetFights,3ce7vu,Windex1211,4,Tue Jul 7 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"So much for equality right? Because women are equal to men in every single way, except when it comes to physical violence.

StreetFights,3ce7vu,Sha11owBay,3,Tue Jul 7 14:50:37 2015 UTC,"Did you watch? It does not look like he wanted to have anything to do with her. He's trying to get a spot at the bar to get a drink(At the beginning you see a few women drinking at the spot they tried to claim. That's prime real estate if you're in a crowded bar.) You can see her obviously trying to block his path as he attempts to get to the open spot next to her. Then she goes off when he shoves his way in. (I'm assuming he was desperately trying to get a drink at a crowded bar. I assume he didn't have anything to do with her because when she talks the first time in his direction, he keeps his head down and continues to try to get the spot.)  I do not condone his actions. He let the situation get the best of him, but I also do not condone the attitude of the woman he hit. She was obviously the aggressor which started the confrontation. It is a fact that if she had just let it go and allowed a spot at the bar, she would not have gotten punched in the face.  With that being said it may put me into a bad light. My opinion is that no man should hit a woman, no matter what the case*. But I also believe that women should be held responsible for their actions if they start an aggressive situation with a man, such as being kicked out of the club. His retaliation to her aggression was not the correct thing to do, but she did instigate the situation in the first place."

Also you're saying that someone like that girl wouldn't actually punch someone, she's just trying to ""look tough""... well she did punch him, so she wasn't just ""all talk"". If someone balls a fists and cocks back at me, they're telling me they're ready to punch me.

If a huge guy threw a punch and missed, a big punch is warranted because it could have caused some serious damage and you don't want to risk him throwing another one. You can't punch weak people and expect not to get backlash unless you've tried every alternate route to defuse the situation because everyone knows you were not in danger or pain, so you are equally an aggressor when you disproportionately respond like this video."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,21,Tue Jul 7 19:50:54 2015 UTC,So you're supposed to just let people hit you if you're bigger and stronger?
StreetFights,3cc7pa,kempff,-18,Tue Jul 7 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"This is such an oversimplification. This is the kind of logic that justifies Israel slaughtering Palestinians because Palestine attack them too. If you're big and tough, a little girl slapping you slightly isn't going to have the same impact on you as if you hit them back. It is your responsibility as the bigger stronger person to make a logical decision about what an appropriate response is. By your logic if a child comes up and hits you you're allowed to lay them out?  People love thinking in black and whites on this site."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,bigmantingop,19,Tue Jul 7 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"a little girl slapping you slightly   Try being ""slapped slightly"" on the corner of your eyelid by a ""little girl"" wearing a fistful of rings and half-inch-long fingernails.  (I love how you equate women with children, btw.)"
StreetFights,3cc7pa,kempff,-18,Mon Jul 6 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"I'm equating because you said ""if you're bigger and stronger"" - Are you not bigger and stronger than a child? You at no point mentioned women in your comment, don't try and turn the argument away from the point."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,bigmantingop,13,Mon Jul 6 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"Bigger and stronger. So if a smaller man swings at him and catches the corner of his face, he should let that go too?  I'm not advocating anything, but she's an adult as well. He just had better aim. She could've very well ruined his career with a ring that made its way into his eye. There's always two sides."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Schizophrenics,6,Tue Jul 7 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"Comparing this to the Palestinian conflict is a clumsy platitude at best, and insulting to the torture they endure at the worst."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,clutchest_nugget,-8,Mon Jul 6 20:04:06 2015 UTC,The logic that any aggression from one party deserves the full force from another is completely applicable. The fact that the argument is being used in a much more trivial context is immaterial.
StreetFights,3cc7pa,bigmantingop,3,Mon Jul 6 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is any response in self defense is warranted until the attacker is subdued. How is he to know that woman won't continue her assault or that she won't escalate to hitting him with a bottle? From the looks of it she made it into a physical confrontation, therefore in my opinion he has the right to take whatever actions he sees fit to end the confrontation. The same way a light slap in a cops face can get you laid out  or tazed or even shot."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,hoberglobin,-8,Mon Jul 6 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"Again though this is like decent theory to go upon but look at the footage, if you were judging this case by case would you really deem that this man was danger of being harmed? Because I don't know about American law but in England a pre-emptive strike is only warranted if you genuinely fear for your safety. From the article saying that he tried to push past her and she told him not, if this is true then he was aggravating her and yes she is still wrong for initiating physical contact but as a big dude like he is, if you're starting arguments with girls in bars to the point where they feel the need to hit you then you are a piece of shit."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,bigmantingop,5,Mon Jul 6 23:54:48 2015 UTC,The thing is he doesn't know how far she will escalate this. It was his decision to take a measure that would ensure she would not. Perfectly reasonable self defense strategy. Sure he might have been able to stop her attack in another way but it was in his right to do it that way. My point being that once any person starts a physical confrontation they should be ready for the full force of the person they attacked.
StreetFights,3cc7pa,hoberglobin,-14,Tue Jul 7 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you're in no danger and you brutally hit someone for a little tap than you're a dick. Her punch wasn't going to bruise him, he could have killed her."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,12,Tue Jul 7 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"On second thought you may be right. Maybe provocation shouldn't carry real consequences.  I'll have to try that at the club tonight. It'll be fun going up to huge guys, trying to punch them in the face with my one fist gently while giving them a little tap on the cheek with my other, and having them arrested for misdemeanor battery if they give me a bloody nose in response."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,kempff,-7,Tue Jul 7 02:21:15 2015 UTC,"I responded to someone else, but yes that's what I'm saying. What kind of stupid do you have to be to seriously hurt someone when you can restrain them or just move. I said it earlier but you guys like selectively quoting me. I think if you're stuck with no option but to fight go for it. Fight a whole bingo parlor, but getting gently provoked and potentially killing someone is stupid. My friend was weeks away from becoming a firefighter and he's blind in one eye now from a street fight. This stuff has real consequences."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,6,Tue Jul 7 00:31:55 2015 UTC,"Why is her punch a ""gentle provoke"" yet his is a ""potential death hit""  The white knight is in town...  It doesn't matter dude.  She first threatened to hit and then actually punched him after he grabbed her raised fist.  If she thinks she can get away with it because she's ""weak"" or a girl than that is fucked.   Im sure she will think differently next time before pulling some dangerous stupid shit and then pulling the pussy pass."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Chickenthings4,0,Tue Jul 7 01:47:43 2015 UTC,Why didn't he just walk away from the fight?
StreetFights,3cc7pa,TalkBigShit,0,Tue Jul 7 00:00:18 2015 UTC,He asks himself that all the time. His whole career fucked by on horrible decision
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,9,Tue Jul 7 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"So I'm a pretty skinny guy. Let's say I go up to some guy twice my size and throw a punch. He's a dick if he hits me back with full force? What if he punches me twice when I only punched him once, he becomes the villain? No. You say to ""look beyond the gender bullshit"" but literally the only way your argument could possibly make sense is to invoke ""the gender bullshit.""   These types of asinine rules don't exist in a fist fight. This chick probably relies heavily on her pussy pass and it got denied this time.  I'm just of the mindset that you shouldn't hit anyone in general, unless you have good reason to and are prepared to be in a fight if you do."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Xander707,-3,Tue Jul 7 00:12:59 2015 UTC,If you go up to a huge guy and start a fight because you're belligerent and he decides rather than avoid fighting you it's better to beat you silly I think he would be the bad guy. Everyone on here acts like walking away isn't an option. It's irresponsible to beat people because we can. We should have restraint to know when we have to fight and when we shouldn't. If you dont have the restraint not to beat someone when your physical advantage gives you every option of doing so you're a bully and the bad guy.
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,6,Tue Jul 7 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"See, walking away is an option. It is not the only option. I see nothing irresponsible about defending yourself against an aggressor, even if that agressor is perceived to be weaker than you are."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Xander707,-4,Tue Jul 7 01:19:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like bat man's grandpa said something about power and responsibility, probably just telling him to punch to kill when dumb bitchs use the pussy pass. I can't remember the exact quote."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,7,Tue Jul 7 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"Thats the shit women hide behind.  What am I gonna give her a 10% strength hit?  Still wouldnt be ok.  If you touch anyone regardless of sex, tough shit, you get hit back.  I wish I would have hit women back when they've hit me all drunk at bars.  Its really stupid that a man has to just take it."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Hootietang,2,Tue Jul 7 08:47:31 2015 UTC,If you've been hit by multiple women at bars you might be a dick. It's not a super common thing.
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,4,Tue Jul 7 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"lol Sorry, I should say its happened once.  Nonetheless I wanted to hit back.  Its not super common, but I sure see it once every two weeks at bars."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Hootietang,-4,Tue Jul 7 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"And if you get whooped on and you can't move than you should. I'm not saying don't defend yourself, I just don't get the obsession with laying girls out over tiny slaps. There's a big difference"
StreetFights,3cc7pa,GunnerandDixie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:08:28 2015 UTC,"lol I get what you are saying, but its not about sex.  You should walk away from anyone trying to punch you, however it bothers me that this girl clearly instigated, and buddy is being charged.  All she had to do was scream (without him hitting her) and guess what; charged.  Its ridiculous.  Also, if buddy hadnt had his hands in defensive position and deflected the slap, it may have been worse.  Im not advocated laying a girl out, what I am saying is that she deserved what happened."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Hootietang,-2,Tue Jul 7 02:34:07 2015 UTC,"Jesus fucking Christ this isn't a DnD game. If ""drunk girls at bars"" have hit you, in your past, and you walked away... you did the right thing."

StreetFights,3cc7pa,Fishwhistling,-18,Tue Jul 7 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"So what?  If you're a rational human being your goal should be to solve the situation in the best fit way.  It's toddler level logic to punch someone back simply because they punched you when there are a thousand better responses that don't involve unnecessary uses of violence.  The guy in question was an athletic monster, QB for one of the largest collegiate football programs in America.  And now you're telling me when a much smaller person punches him he's incapable of reasoning that a simple move to restrain the person isn't an option?  He has to punch the punch them in the face...for the sole reason the other person did it and now it's an acceptable response?"
StreetFights,3cc7pa,Taj_Ramos,15,Tue Jul 7 13:41:14 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how calm, collect, and capable of an instant, complete, analysis of the situation most of you think you'd do after you unexpectedly get popped in the chops at a bar."
StreetFights,3cc7pa,edgeloard,-4,Mon Jul 6 23:39:44 2015 UTC,"It's not like he threw punches wildly into the area without any capability of seeing who his attacker is.  I find it pretty absurd his defense is essentially ""it was physically impossible for me to figure out the person hitting me was a small woman even though I got a clean punch off.""  Especially when he was already looking at her beforehand and they were tangled up.  You're telling me he just doesn't have the capability to figure out when to throw a punch and not you know, push the person away?  They were obviously holding on to each other before either of them punched.    Watch the video, it's clear he could have just pushed her away.  I don't understand how all brain function stops when a half assed punch comes your way.  Just push, it's not that impossible to do.    Edit: He was looking directly at the woman and they were holding on to each other before hand.  I don't see how your first reaction to a woman sending a half assed punch your way is to knock her in the head when it clearly isn't a sucker punch and you can see it coming.  Your ability to reason doesn't just vanish when lightly punched in the face by someone you're tangled up with.  And your responsibility doesn't either."

It seems like people view this as two completely different scenarios taking place depending on their bias. I see two douches being douches. The girl acted like a stupid entitled brat for hitting him and he completely overreacted to it and threw a power punch at a skinny white girl. No doubt he's already got the shit end of the stick and the girls jaw and face didn't have to be completely reconstructed so people should calm down.

StreetFights,3c2oj9,virginpresident,6,Sat Jul 4 17:00:16 2015 UTC,He was at least comfortable enough to play guard (and get passed) but he recovered pretty well in taking his back right out of side control; granted the other kid doesn't know what side control is most likely.
StreetFights,3c2oj9,BAmaximus,2,Sat Jul 4 21:22:40 2015 UTC,He waited for the kid to mess up. Then got him in a hold and finished the fight. He knew what he was doing.

Both of those kids are basically full grown and they both know how to fight. Plus if you accidentally hurt one of the kids you're gonna get sued to shit. Not surprising they dont get involved.
StreetFights,3c2oj9,an_wha,-5,Sun Jul 5 01:39:03 2015 UTC,How sexist.

You said:   You think a woman should have to get involved in this shit? Both of those kids are basically full grown and they both know how to fight.   Those are different statements. If you'd like to reword your original statement to make your point clear, then that would be advisable."
StreetFights,3c2oj9,Urnotgonnalikeme,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:27:36 2015 UTC,I fail to see how what I said isnt pretty much what I meant so I think itll be fine. Thanks though!
StreetFights,3c2oj9,an_wha,-5,Sun Jul 5 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"Well, what you said implies (this is me giving you the benefit of the doubt, you flat out said that they shouldn't) that women in general should not be engaged in breaking up students. When, in fact, you meant that smaller and weaker women should not be breaking up fights between larger, stronger students.  Women who are larger than students or have are trained to handle such situations would be absolutely able, and probably recommended, to handle these situation over men who are smaller or weaker than the students.  It's a subtlety, I suppose. But your original statement, is indeed sexist.  EDIT: Feel free to downvote me all you want. You're just downvoting your own education. I suppose that's nothing new to you though."
