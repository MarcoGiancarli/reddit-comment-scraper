Highly recommended for when you're extra hungry."

grilledcheese,3e30ze,HockeyCannon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of ""melts"". Almost every ""grilled cheese"" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called ""grilledcheese"" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled ""melts"" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples ""grilled cheeses"" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now. You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt."

grilledcheese,3czeou,ilmrynorlion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, for some reason I'd think the mayo would stick to the pan...  I'm definitely trying this soon!"
grilledcheese,3czeou,CoopersSparkling,3,Sun Jul 12 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"You'll want a thin, even covering. It is easy to use too much. If the top side doesn't fry quite as much as you would like (I think it sometimes happens if the mayo soaks in to the bread too much) you can throw a little extra on right before you flip. I wouldn't try it the first time though."
grilledcheese,3czeou,ilmrynorlion,3,Sun Jul 12 13:49:19 2015 UTC,Nice one!
grilledcheese,3czeou,CoopersSparkling,3,Sun Jul 12 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Mayo is mostly just olive oil and if you heat it it basicly turns back into liquid oil, which is great for grilling ofcourse."

grilledcheese,3cw0kw,mrnagrom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"a jaffle is a special kind of toasted sandwich made in one of these special machines called a jaffle iron.   you can put anything you like in the jaffle, but most jaffles contain cheese.  the advantage of using a jaffle iron, is that it creates a pocket of bread around your chosen filling, and seals the edges in so a large quantity of filling may be used.    the jaffle iron heats from both sides, so the contents will be cooked/melted.   the jaffle in the linked post contains ham, egg, and cheese.  imagine a jaffle just filled with cheese.  imagine one filled with several different kinds of cheese..  i think you would love them mrnagrom."

grilledcheese,3ci36w,ridgy_didge,12,Wed Jul 8 09:34:25 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah, halloumi is the best grilled cheese and it doesn't melt away."

grilledcheese,3ci36w,tankjr,24,Wed Jul 8 04:09:35 2015 UTC,"It did, but I tried to keep it on long enough to give it the nice grilled look. If it was any thinner it likely would have melted through the grate before browning like that."
grilledcheese,3ci36w,saumanahaii,62,Wed Jul 8 04:12:47 2015 UTC,So it melted! So you admit this is a melt!
grilledcheese,3ci36w,sorafan9393,18,Wed Jul 8 05:16:45 2015 UTC,"It melted in char, though.  Which makes it a quesadilla."
grilledcheese,3ci36w,RayHell666,6,Wed Jul 8 08:02:37 2015 UTC,Yum! What kind of cheese?
grilledcheese,3ci36w,tikkstr,16,Wed Jul 8 03:18:17 2015 UTC,Probably Halloumi cheese. It's really good grilled.
grilledcheese,3ci36w,teslaguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:24:09 2015 UTC,It's like candy. I could just eat it in grilled pieces from a bowl.
grilledcheese,3ci36w,travelinghobbit,6,Wed Jul 8 12:46:29 2015 UTC,Could also be Leipäjuusto aka Finnish squeaky cheese.
grilledcheese,3ci36w,ohthegym,5,Wed Jul 8 04:01:27 2015 UTC,Op says it is mozzarella.

grilledcheese,3ci36w,Selafyne,5,Wed Jul 8 05:23:53 2015 UTC,"Grilled cheese, literally. I like your way of thinking."
grilledcheese,3ci36w,elh93,4,Wed Jul 8 06:56:23 2015 UTC,Surprised mozzarella lasted like that it tends to be quite soft and wet but as other posts have mentioned halloumi is amazing grilled.

grilledcheese,3cbr0o,cammclain,2,Wed Jul 8 02:12:53 2015 UTC,"""A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of ""melts"". Almost every ""grilled cheese"" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called ""grilledcheese"" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled ""melts"" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples ""grilled cheeses"" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now. You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt."""

grilledcheese,3c5zp8,abw,0,Sun Jul 5 10:21:19 2015 UTC,"Cheddar cheese:       Cheddar cheese is a relatively hard, pale-yellow-to-off-white (or yellow-orange if spices such as annatto are added), sometimes ""sharp"" (i.e., acidic)-tasting, natural cheese. Originating in the English village of Cheddar in Somerset,  cheeses of this style are produced beyond this region and in several countries around the world.  Cheddar is the most popular type of cheese in the UK, accounting for 51 percent of the country's £1.9 billion annual cheese market.  It is also the second-most-popular cheese in the U.S.A. (behind mozzarella), with an average annual consumption of 10 lb (4.5 kg) per capita.   The United States produced 3,233,380,000 lb (1,443,470 long tons; 1,466,640 tonnes) in 2010,  and the UK 258,000 long tons (262,000 tonnes) in 2008.  The term ""Cheddar cheese"" is widely used, but has no Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) within the European Union. However, only Cheddar produced from local milk within four counties of South West England may use the name ""West Country Farmhouse Cheddar"".   Cheddar produced in Orkney is registered as protected geographical indication (PGI) under the name ""Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar"".

grilledcheese,3bbkos,yshuduno,3,Sun Jun 28 03:27:31 2015 UTC,"The Munsters:       The Munsters is an American television sitcom depicting the home life of a family of benign monsters. It stars Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster and Yvonne De Carlo as his wife, Lily Munster. The series was a satire of both traditional monster movies and the wholesome family fare of the era, and was produced by the creators of Leave It to Beaver.   It ran concurrently with the similarly macabre themed The Addams Family, though had higher figures in the Nielsen ratings.  The series originally aired on Thursday at 7:30pm on CBS from September 24, 1964, to May 12, 1966; 70 episodes were produced. It was cancelled after ratings dropped to a low due to the premiere of ABC's Batman, which was in color.  Though ratings were low during its initial two-year run, The Munsters found a large audience in syndication. This popularity warranted a spin-off series, as well as several films, including one with a theatrical release.   On October 26, 2012, NBC aired a modern reimagining of The Munsters called Mockingbird Lane as a pilot. The series failed to be picked up by NBC despite success with Munster fans and good ratings.

First take the cheese out of the fridge until it comes close to room temp.   Heat pan on 3 (I think my stove top runs a bit hot) for 5 or so minutes.   Construct sandwich, drop 1/2 tablespoon of butter in pan (I used to spread on bread and construct in pan but this is so much simpler). Place in sandwich and COVER for about 3 minutes (guessing).  Remove with spatula, leaving sandwich on spatula to the side. Throw in another half tablespoon butter, and repeat process.   Perfectly crispy, gooey grilled cheese. If you have some tips on improving my process send them my way!"

How I do it is I cook the grilled cheese so that both sides are separate  with melted cheese on both sides, (inner and outer but the outer is your call.) so you'll have a grilled cheese that's pull apart, then you'll put some jelly or jam, I'd go with jam since it has less seeds (or w/e has less seeds where you live) and just put a glob in the center then softly put the sandwich together.  You want enough that it's in ever bite but a small enough amount that it never gets squeezed out of the sandwich because the cheese will be a slick surface for the jam/jelly to squirt out.    tl;dr: it's an art"

The cheese I used was Colby-Jack inside and a shredded cheese mix for the crust. If you wanna do this, I'd suggest cooking it on medium-low in a pan with a cover on, so that the egg cooks all the way through. Mine was cooked pretty well, and the yolk was only mildly runny.

grilledcheese,3ae6mj,Sobertese,3,Fri Jun 19 12:33:04 2015 UTC,"The ""trick"" (I say that... it's pretty basic) is to start with a decent quality bread and fry the sandwich in lots of butter on medium heat so that it goes nice and golden (but not too fast, so the cheese has time to melt). You can add more butter when you flip it.  A griddle pan helps so that you get those nice lines on it.  Finally, adding extra grated cheese to the outside provides a satisfying cheesy crust - because we all like it when a bit of cheese escapes and ends up going crisp, right? Might as well make that happen on purpose every time..."
grilledcheese,3ae6mj,DrDecontaminato,3,Fri Jun 19 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, I use more butter than Paula Dean   But I've never done the cheesy crust. Do you do it when you first plop the sandwich in the pan, or some time near the end of grilling so it doesn't burn?"
grilledcheese,3ae6mj,DirtyGingy,2,Fri Jun 19 14:25:04 2015 UTC,I add it at the end. It only needs 30 secs to 1 minute on each side to give it a nice crust.

grilledcheese,3ae6mj,wedlp,3,Fri Jun 19 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"yeah, you need to balance the tart of the tomatoes with something, thus the onions."

I started with two large slices of seeded wholemeal bread, which is way tastier than that white nonsense. I smeared wholegrain mustard on one side and Colman's mustard (the good stuff) on the other. I then added strong cheddar (I'm British; cheddar all the way) and some diced onions, melted a decent amount of butter in a griddle pan, and set it a-cookin', weighed down with a heavy plate.  Crucially, once it was done I melted some grated cheddar on each side to give it a satisfying crust. Served with mayo for dippin'.  Then I took a picture so that I could share it with strangers on the internet because it's 2015 and apparently this is what we do now."

Just put the cheese over the surface of the tortilla and throw it in the microwave til the cheese is melted and then roll it up :D. You could also cut tortillas into triangles and fry them up for some amazing fresh nachos! ;)

grilledcheese,39u9eq,yaboyjoe,5,Sun Jun 14 20:49:02 2015 UTC,I always use both. I oil the pan and butter the bread. makes for the best of grilled cheeses
grilledcheese,39u9eq,PRkarate04,3,Sun Jun 14 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"I put the butter in the pan along with about half as much olive oil as butter. I really like the results I get with that, although I probably overuse butter, whereas your method uses exactly as much butter as you need."
grilledcheese,39u9eq,dinosaursandsluts,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:29:29 2015 UTC,"your way sounds absolutely delicious though! I put just shy of a healthy (well, unhealthy really) amount of butter down on each side and enough oil to cover about 3/4 of the pan, which is ~8"" diameter"
grilledcheese,39u9eq,PRkarate04,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Also, if it's available, I like to just use straight up bacon fat. 😊"
grilledcheese,39u9eq,dinosaursandsluts,2,Mon Jun 15 03:00:17 2015 UTC,Olive oil isn't usually good for frying as it burns at a low temperature and in the process also turns to trans-fat. Corn oil would be a better choice especially when mixing with butter as it's sweeter. BTW the best olive oil is Greek. The Italians have to cut Greek oil into theres to make it better.

grilledcheese,39kcyh,Sobertese,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:15:29 2015 UTC,I don't know how you could get those results. Maybe you put too much on?
grilledcheese,39kcyh,slomotion,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:08:43 2015 UTC,If you are using mayo you might want to turn the heat up on your pan before you place to mayo-ed bread on. Hopefully you are spreading the mayo on the bread and not in the pan like some sort of oil. (I've seen some people put the butter in the pan then the bread on top like some sort of game of horseshoes.) i've had crispy grilled cheese with mayo that changes the whole playing field with different kinds of cheeses.
grilledcheese,39kcyh,kemal007,2,Fri Jun 12 17:02:16 2015 UTC,I did put it on the bread. I'm willing to try again! Maybe in a cast iron with real high heat.
grilledcheese,39kcyh,Shaolin_TootsiFrutsi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:37:13 2015 UTC,Ohhhh man cast iron blasting is the way to cook. If you have that luxury you could even melt cheese directly onto the bread and just scrape it if later and eat it. I want to do this now.
grilledcheese,39kcyh,Zabii,2,Fri Jun 12 23:13:03 2015 UTC,Really?  I've heard of it before. I guess I'll give that a try. It just sounds too tangy for some cheeses.

grilledcheese,39guba,magnesiummike,14,Thu Jun 11 17:00:56 2015 UTC,"To do this right, you'd start by cooking the bacon until it is juuust about to lose its flexibility. Then, in the bacon grease, make your usual grilled cheese. Drain the bacon fat (keep it for later, obviously), and wrap the grilled cheese in the almost crispy bacon, using the technique shown in the link, or any other, I'd be partial to a bacon basket-weave here. Finally, put the bacon-wrapped grilled cheese in the pan and cook to your preferred crispiness."
grilledcheese,39guba,Xylord,44,Thu Jun 11 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"The issue with this is all the grease from that amount of bacon will probably ruin the inner sandwich, the bread is going to be a greasy soaked mess.

Although where I will probably make it, that is so back-o-beyond and wat-de-boer-niet-kent-vreet-ie-niet (what the farmer doesn't know, he won't have) that Gruyère is a little hard to get by.

grilledcheese,38cv9t,fizzyspells,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:14:46 2015 UTC,"The idiom means... well... quite literally what it says. Some simple-minded people will refuse to eat something they've never heard of. If all they've ever eaten and known to eat is boiled potatoes, cabbage and bacon chops, then giving them pasta will make them uncomfortable, or they might refuse to eat it outright.   i'm surprised you don't have better cheese in the netherlands   It's just a discomfort of that corner of the countryside. Go to the city, find a good cheese shop there and the options are nearly endless. Heck, pretty much every town has it's own tiny twist on Gouda cheese. Being one of the oldest semi-hard to hard cheese still in production today (first records are from 1184 AD, source) has given a lot of cheesemakers room for slight variations.  Sidenote: TIL ageing Gouda cheese (or any cheese that is aged for the matter, I guess) for more than 18 months makes it dank."

grilledcheese,3800uu,VanessaClarkLove,5,Sun May 31 21:03:38 2015 UTC,You can't say that and not give more details! How is the bread made?
grilledcheese,3800uu,Buttock,2,Mon Jun 1 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"Well, sourdoughs are made with natural airborne yeast, rather than commercial yeast (sold in jars and packets). To capture the yeast, you mix flour and water and leave it out uncovered. You continue to do this for several days and it becomes frothy and sour smelling. Now you have a sourdough starter! Sourdough starters are often maintained for years- all you need to do is mix in new flour and water once a week, while the rest of the time you keep it in the fridge. When it's time to make bread, you need to give your starter new flour and water and wait for it to become active (about three hours). Then you add flour and a little more water to the starter along with salt, oil, and any mix ins you like. This is where it gets tricky. The yeast will rise the bread on it's own terms- sometimes a few hours, but usually much longer. I often wait 30 hours before it's ready. Then you shape it and prepare for the second rise which, again, takes as long as it takes. Finally you bake. The whole process is long, yes, but the bread is amazing and studies show that sourdough is much healthier for you. It is lower on the glycemic index and has less gluten (apparently some celiacs can even eat sourdough?)."
grilledcheese,3800uu,mir_enmasse,2,Mon Jun 1 03:04:27 2015 UTC,That looks incredible! Would you mind sharing your sourdough recipe? I've never been able to get a crumb like that. Your post reminded me that I have some hungry starter in the fridge as well...
grilledcheese,3800uu,mir_enmasse,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"Sure!  I always start with a well fed starter, sometimes feeding it twice. I take out around 75g of starter from my batch and then feed that (rather than feeding the whole batch). Then I mix all the ingredients except the salt and let the dough autolyse (rest) for at least 30 minutes. Then I mix a little water with the salt (which I always triple what the recipe asks for) and add that into the dough. I take this time to do the first knead (about ten folds). Every thirty minutes or so, I do another few kneads, about four times. For the bulk rise, I do it in the fridge, overnight and sometimes much longer, say until 6pm. I usually see a massive increase in volume, a little less than half. After shaping the dough, it goes into the Dutch oven for a second short rise on the counter. I wait until it's puffy, but not well risen, the preheat the oven to 450. The top is slashed and goes into the oven for three minutes at 450 before turning down to 400. Bake for twenty with the lid on, then pull the lid off. I bake for another 30, and then pull the bread out of the Dutch oven all together and place it directly on the rack for a final ten minutes.  Phew! And then it's done.   Edit: an insane amount of typos"

grilledcheese,37uhko,loweb1,10,Sat May 30 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"It's melted alright, but the rind holds the gooey center in until you smash the top and bottom together.   Also, I know it's a sacrilege ""grilled"" cheese but it tastes great, so I figured someone here would want to try it."
grilledcheese,37uhko,StagKen,20,Sat May 30 22:38:52 2015 UTC,You didn't cut the rind off D:
grilledcheese,37uhko,Miguelv93,13,Sat May 30 18:08:32 2015 UTC,That's the best part of the brie IMHO !
grilledcheese,37uhko,ConorPMc,11,Sat May 30 18:26:25 2015 UTC,As part of a sandwich though?
grilledcheese,37uhko,AbsoluteZro,10,Sat May 30 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah! As part of anything.   It also holds the melty cheese in nice gooey slices. so when you drizzle the honey on the hot cheese, it sinks into the brie and disappears until you bite in.   I usually do these with regular butter and raspberry jam, but all I had was garlic and herb Kerry gold, so I switched it up."
grilledcheese,37uhko,playing_the_angel,4,Sat May 30 22:35:47 2015 UTC,Jam+brie is so damn good.

grilledcheese,379rfu,kitchbitch,2,Tue May 26 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"This.  Cook it on heat low enough that the cheese is melting before you flip it the first time but the bread hasn't burned yet.  You may have to experiment, on my range that is a ""4"".  When you flip it, you can turn the heat up a little, since the cheese is mostly melted already, the other side can cook a bit faster.  Remember, as long as the bread isn't burned, you can't really overcook a grilled cheese."

It's 1kg bakers flour, 14g dried yeast, 480ml body temp water, 10g salt, and as much rosemary, olives and Parmesan as you please.  Bring together the first four ingredients until you have a smooth dough, and knead until you can stretch it to see a 'clear window' without it breaking. Add olives etc & gently knead through until evenly distributed. Rest dough for 10-15 minutes, knock back and shape your loaf. Cover that baby in sea salt & rosemary. Bake @ 210c. Eat straight from the oven with lashings on butter."

grilledcheese,3748sr,Jack_Flanders,2,Mon May 25 09:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yes! First time hearing someone else grilling leftover spaghetti =)  I've also grilled turkey sandwiches, balogna and cheese sandwiches, mac and cheese sandwich(I suggest shells, rather than original macoroni, it's less likely to shift around), lasagna, campbells bean & bacon soup & american cheese sandwiches.  There's something magical about frying butter on bread that makes anything taste like the food of the gods."

I started by coating the bread with butter, and placing the slices on a buttered pan. I added a layer of boars head white American, 2nd layer Monterey Jack, 3rd layer shredded mozzarella. Let those puppies get an even gold crisp, and slapped the fried mac and cheese on top of one side, while placing the other side on top of the Mac and cheese. Then I gently pressed for an even melt.

grilledcheese,36q8i4,oneonetwooneonetwo,8,Thu May 21 11:24:29 2015 UTC,"It makes me think he's that kind of vegan, in particular.  Oh, yeah? Your grilled cheese sandwich didn't involve hurting animals, did it?"
grilledcheese,36q8i4,SkaJamas,6,Thu May 21 12:32:39 2015 UTC,vegetarian. vegans dont eat cheese.  if they're vegan they're eating some fake ass cheddar.
grilledcheese,36q8i4,DreamPhreak2,5,Thu May 21 12:49:59 2015 UTC,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
grilledcheese,36q8i4,wlkngcntrdctn,2,Thu May 21 13:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the lack of meat on his sandwich and those two words make me believe he's a fellow vegetarian. [I'm vegetarian/almost vegan who eats egg and cheese occasionally--hence my subscription to this sub] And honestly, I think ""no savagery"" was unnecessarily used.   When I see you guys [assuming you eat meat, I could be wrong] posts grilled cheese sandwiches with ham, bacon and/or other kinds of meat, those sandwiches still looks visually pleasing to me; but I wouldn't think of eating them because I have absolutely no taste for meat.  tl/dr: If OP is a vegetarian, I don't think he should have used ""no savagery"" in his title. It seems like a jab at people who eat meat. :/"
grilledcheese,36q8i4,Meliorus,6,Thu May 21 18:34:54 2015 UTC,Did you cook avocado?
grilledcheese,36q8i4,MoonGas,3,Thu May 21 09:15:15 2015 UTC,Is that surprising?   I always use avocado in grilled cheeses and melts. Never thought twice about it.
grilledcheese,36q8i4,sunshinetraffic,3,Thu May 21 12:39:22 2015 UTC,This is my favorite grilled cheese combo.  Nice!
grilledcheese,36q8i4,CaptainUnusual,2,Thu May 21 13:14:18 2015 UTC,No savagery? Then what is that melt doing on a grilled cheese sub?
grilledcheese,36q8i4,professor_d00m,2,Thu May 21 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"She's a beaut. Good job, chef."
grilledcheese,36q7um,uardito,3,Thu May 21 06:47:24 2015 UTC,I want it inside me
grilledcheese,36q7um,up_syndrome,3,Thu May 21 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"No such thing as ""overdoing it on the cheese"". This looks awesome and I love me some challah bread!"
grilledcheese,36q7um,professor_d00m,3,Thu May 21 18:00:11 2015 UTC,Like a slow rolling ocean of cheese - dive in!
grilledcheese,36q6zm,Attila_thehoney,2,Thu May 21 06:36:35 2015 UTC,what sorcery is this. Melted cheese but the bread stays white..!!!??
grilledcheese,36q6zm,darconiandevil,1 point,Thu May 21 17:31:49 2015 UTC,Is that even grilled?
grilledcheese,36o40t,juanesgr,6,Wed May 20 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"The all important question here is: Was it good for you, did you enjoy it?"
grilledcheese,36o40t,officehelpermonkey,6,Wed May 20 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"tbh, it was amazing!"
grilledcheese,36o40t,darconiandevil,9,Thu May 21 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"It is actually my first time making grilled cheese. I used whole wheat bread, a couple slices of a double cream Colombian cheese with a bit of parmesan. And of course I came."
grilledcheese,36o40t,raivynwolf,1 point,Wed May 20 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Whole bread does not grill as good as white bread in my experience. I love whole wheat, but it just does not agree with the browning of the bread on slow heat.   How did the crispness turn out for you?"
grilledcheese,36o40t,nero4983,3,Thu May 21 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty perfect to me, nice job!"
grilledcheese,36o40t,cocksmanjohn,2,Wed May 20 21:17:08 2015 UTC,Thank you!

grilledcheese,36kp68,hassium,2,Wed May 20 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"Oooooh now that's a tasty looking sandwich.  Out of curiosity, any particular reason you went with Turkey bacon as opposed to pig bacon? Is it just personal preference?"
grilledcheese,36g1ht,_brodre,11,Tue May 19 02:37:56 2015 UTC,Tell me what restaurant it is and no one gets hurt
grilledcheese,36g1ht,Donnie69,11,Tue May 19 07:33:50 2015 UTC,That looks amazing! What restaurant is it?
grilledcheese,36g1ht,domtom657,2,Tue May 19 03:00:45 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but it looks like it's from Social Kitchen & Bar in Birmingham, MI."

grilledcheese,36g1ht,iceardor,-2,Tue May 19 17:39:57 2015 UTC,That looks better than a focaccia grilled cheese. Does this one have Indian lime pickle relish/chutney?
