But keep in mind how difficult that would have been at the time. They relied on using stock shots of the ship in space to save costs and making standing sets look battle damaged was a pain in the ass, which is why in the episode we only really see the mess hall, bridge, and some corridors and not places like sick bay."

With DS9 ending the season earlier, they should have been able to make sets that looked thrown together with makeshift alien parts.  They should gave had a candy store worth of set pieces to use (and I think there was a movie from that time also that that could have salvaged from).

What Manny Cato was able to do in just the last season of Ent. showed Star Trek still has potential if the stories start with a solid plot.    I just hope when they reboot for TV the next time someone with true love of the show and the ability to write great stories is given the helm.

""They have a plan."" What plan? To chase humans across the galaxy and then eventually just hang out with them for a bit? What was this grand plan? To wipe out all mankind? To interbreed human and Cylon? Like Lost, BSG starts out great and raises a ton of questions, but doesn't actually answer them in the end. And not the philosophical, unanswerable questions like ""what IS sentience?"" or something, but straight up ""Why are they doing that?"" and then writers come in, shrug their shoulders, and start making characters gain weight or become investigators or whatever for no reason. The five ""sleeper"" Cylons - great plot point, and even the first four (President's Aid, Tigh, Chief, and Anders) make some sense - but Ellen Tigh was kind of lazy and I really didn't feel like they fleshed that out at all. In fact, most of the twelve models had their reasoning and even some of the boring ones like Simon were more plausible/realistic than Ellen Tigh. Lee Adama - they completely ruin this character. And not through lack of trying. But the Lee we see in Season 1 has COMPLETELY disappeared by Season 3, and not because of any real reason. You could point out the Kara thing, and say that was a catalyst, but this is a guy who has WAY more family stuff going on than that, and yet he still seems to just kind of turn into a pretentious dipshit for no reason at all.  Helo/Anders - boring characters with no real character development and they never go anywhere. Cally - possibly one of the most interesting characters with the most potential and they toss her.    Overall the BSG good WELL outweighs the bad - fantastic performances and characters from tons of great cast members - and the great episodes (33, Lay Down Your Burdens, Exodus pt 2, etc) are so good they make the bad episodes harder to remember.  But the problem was that watching the last season and a half or so felt more like a chore than a pleasure. It just dragged on and seemingly went nowhere - and it comes across as burnt-out, unimaginative storytelling.   I have no doubt that RDM was just burned out on the series at that point."

Neelix doesn't mourn her loss. Janeway gets a replacement project with Seven of Nine (as does the Doctor, etc). Seska is always a dislikable character even before you learn she is a Cardassian spy.  This is a much greater issue than any of the issues people have wtih ""ongoing damage"", ""holodeck stories"", or whatever else. Interesting stories are about interesting characters that change.

TNG had Yarr only to bring her back as a pseudoromulan, no one on TOS. I have just recently started watching it because of the vitriol of trekkies (ers) against the series. I am really enjoying it. They are some really powerful well written episodes. Ultimately I've had enough of gritty. It's a thoroughly enjoyable series.

That's actually an indictment of the entire Star Trek ""universe"" across essentially all of the series, from TOS onwards.  Some ""technobabble"" was always available (and generally overused) as a deus ex machina or ""magic wand"" -- and then of course with TNG and onward, they literally tossed in ""magic"" via the all-powerful ""Q"" -- and just like that, we're basically ""back to the way it was before"".  Granted over time, and over the various series they did finally (at first in baby steps, then slightly larger steps) begin to switch away from the isolated-episodic format to ""some things change permanently"" and even eventually to a longer storyline/multi-episode-arc; but nevertheless there was still a ""technology can [basically] fix anything"", and any pain or discomfort or problems are essentially ""temporary""."

Still quite a few standalone episodes, but damage and stuff carried on between episodes. It also seemed like the characters slowly evolved (as much as I love the characters in Voyager, it seemed like they were reset pretty much every episode).  One thing I really love is how Archer still had a rash the episode after that awful one where they turned into frogs. It's something absolutely tiny, but it's them naturally talking about the events of the previous episode.   Mix that with lots of great supporting characters like DS9 and Voyager could have been bloody brilliant."

I get it, it would have been cool to have X/Y. But you know what? They made the right choice by not writing around it. If they broke the replicators in Season 1, it would have meant many many more of the crew dying. Take your pick.

startrek,3e21yd,Drayzen,4,Tue Jul 21 14:04:44 2015 UTC,"Replicating parts presumably takes massive amounts of energy, which would be in short supply when stranded. Remember, they had to ration replicator use for food; why would ship parts be any different?   But the point is not really about the specific issue of showing the ship in disrepair. The point is that there should have been some kind of consistent story elements about the hardships of being stranded so far away from home. Why even make that the premise of the show, if it barely plays a role in the large majority of episodes?  BTW, I was also referring to what you said about a ""selfish need.""

You could also give a justification for why it would be in disrepair, as I did. It's a fictional universe; we don't know how much energy these things take or how easy it is to acquire the necessary energy; the writers could decide either way.   The point is: it would have been a lot more interesting and entertaining if they had actually played to their premise and the fact that they were stranded had had a substantial impact on them.   Imagine this: we're watching a show that was advertised as Shaolin monks doing all kinds of crazy kung fu. But actually it's just a bunch of monks sitting serenely meditating for an hour. I say, ""Wow, this is not good, shouldn't they be doing some kung fu or something interesting; I mean, isn't that what the ad said would be happening?""

Instead of reintroducing TOS aliens to the TNG crowd, they decided to be lazy and go with familiar and more than well established aliens. I'm glad they touched on the Tellerites and Andorians, but they should have been more prominent in the first couple seasons. They went a bit in depth with the Andorians, especially their relationship with the Vulcans, but they seemed to have lost interest in the Tellerites after one or two season one episodes. There should have been rules about using too many species established in TNG and The Borg should have been the one they never ever ever ever used.

The network didn't want a prequel at all, they wanted to jump another 100 years into the future. The only way they allowed the prequel to happen was if an element of the post-Voyager future was introduced into the show, which led to the temporal cold war arc being forced.

From Wikipedia   The Prime Directive is explicitly defined in the March 1968 episode ""Bread and Circuses"":  ""No identification of self or mission. No interference with the social development of said planet. No references to space or the fact that there are other worlds or civilizations.""   So it's not about interfering with life in general, it's about existing cultures. Supposedly, the idea came about as a parallel to the US actions in Vietnam, as many believed (and still believe) that the US was wrongfully interfering in other cultures.   I really didn't like the episode of TNG 'Pen Pals' in which Picard was willing to let an entire planet be eradicated rather than interfere (even if he did change his mind on a technicality later). If they're all going to die, the Prime Directive is pointless and should be rightfully ignored."

I however really like the theme tune and it always seems a shame that so many Trek fans dismiss an entire series because of a song! Seems pretty stupid to me as the series is great IMO.  I just bought the Enterprise box set on Blu-ray and there is a great hour long candid chat between Berman and Bragga on there.  They are very honest about the shows flaws.  At one point, Berman describes how everyone hates the theme song, and they laugh at their own lame attempts top improve it with the reworked season 3 and 4 version.  Berman goes on to say (humbly I felt) that basically, despite the fact almost everyone seems to hate it, he can't help but think that it was still the right choice for the show and what it was trying to do.  It evokes a much rawer sense of exploration, and establishes the time period as being much nearer to our own as it is a contemporary sound.  I tend to agree with him.  I hope that in time, more people will come round to Bermans view point and realise that it was a good and bold choice.  Also, it's not like you don't have the brilliant ""Archers Theme"" on the end credits, so it's not exactly like the show is completely devoid of more traditional Trek music entirely."

I think the first shot of Pathfinder is what sets it off.  It was such a small leap, but it was such a leap. But it was just the beginning.

startrek,3e1uuo,ohliamylia,9,Tue Jul 21 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"IMO, the fact that UPN went belly-up a year after cancelling ST:E makes me think that it's popularity wasn't the issue.  I've heard through the grapevine that ST:E was more popular than the increasingly less accurate viewership numbers gave it credit for, due in no small part to the rise of TIVO-like devices (which Star Trek fans where savvy to use).  Also, the people who tuned into ST:E generally didn't watch the other programs on UPN, and vise versa.  All those things created a perfect storm that causes ST:E to be cancelled.  I suppose it could have limped along just enough to be moved to the CW after UPN died..."
startrek,3e1uuo,njfreddie,4,Tue Jul 21 10:25:40 2015 UTC,"the fact that UPN went belly-up a year after cancelling ST:E makes me think that it's popularity wasn't the issue.   Actually... it's arguable that the failure of UPN is largely because of the enduring popularity of Trek.  As a smaller network, UPN had less money to work with to develop new shows.  And having two equal owners in Paramount and Chris-Craft Television, how to best spend that money was constantly in dispute.  However, Star Trek is this big monolith that's expensive to make.  Despite being partially owned by the same parent company, Paramount Television was not about to sell Trek to UPN at anything less than market value, and because so much money was going to Trek and was the only show on the network that could even remotely be considered a hit, which mean a lot of UPN's budget went to Trek and less was available to develop other shows. (a chicken and the egg situation) In contrast, look at the way Fox and The WB were highly experimental early on which helped them discover early hits like Married with Children, The Simpsons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Dawson's Creek.  It was pretty clear to the people running UPN that they needed to ditch Star Trek in order to have a chance to succeed even before Enterprise, but as Paramount's cash cow, the parent company forced UPN to take Enterprise anyway.  By the end of ENT's run, it wasn't even the most popular show on UPN, America's Next Top Model was, which I'm sure accelerated the push to cancel ENT because now UPN had a homegrown, inexpensive show with a target audience that they could more easily build the network around.  That UPN was able to merge with The WB as equal partners (which is a huge deal for anyone who understands the history of both networks) shows just how dramatic ANTM was in changing the fortunes of UPN post-Trek."

I never had much of a problem with ""Faith of the Heart"" per se, but I agree it never was Star Trek-ish. This song is awesomely fitting and better than ""Faith."" It has a striking synchronicity with the historical images of exploration leading through to the first warp flight of the Phoenix and the launch of the NX-01. It is also well-bookended by the Ending Credit Theme. It screams the premise of the show: ""This is it, Terrans.  At last we're living mankind's most unobtainable dream.  We're out in space at long last.  Let's see what's out there."" Maybe the streaming services can't, but you'd think the Blu-rays and DVDs could give the viewers the option of switching the song."

Picard on the other hand was given this brand spankin new flagship of the Federation to boldly go exploring.. Sisko was told to babysit the kids.

startrek,3dyc7h,jmk4422,167,Mon Jul 20 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"Transcribed version below in case you, like me, had a hard time with that website.    27th October  Dear Gene,  Thank you for a delightful lunch on Friday and the chance to gossip a lot, reflect a little and complain moderately. I thought it might be useful to recapitulate part of our conversation and expand it somewhat.  I requested the meeting that we might review the state of play with regard to Capt.P. My main argument was that Picard, a quarter of the way into our second season, found himself having to perform an essentially repetative action: the Enterprise is threatened and Picard 'deals' with it:   Unstable Virus. Nagilum. Moriarty Debin/Kushell. Graves/Data.   Picard is leader, negotiator, peace-maker, ombudsman. He thinks, he talks, he assesses, he bluffs (for all which qualities I love him, as I am the one who has said again and again that this Captain is a diplomat and an ambassador) but essentially, in each of these five stories, he is a reactor, hardly ever, what I think we used to call in days long gone, a protagonist. From the actors viewpoint the challenge is of a narrow spectrum and the stimulation moderate. In otherwords, as I sadly said on Friday, the work and the prospect of work is somewhat less interesting than our first season.  To view this positively; what do I want for Picard?  Firstly - and a familiar refrain - more character in the writing of the role; language, action, attitude, idiosyncracy. In the writers guide you say that Picard '...enjoys the privileges that go with his rank and vessel - also the eccentricities permitted.' Our stories have furnished little in the way of permitted eccenticities or the enjoyment of privileges.  A greater physical involvement, where possible. Of course the Captain must not be put at risk, nor should he be treated like a Sevre tea service. I still blush at the memory of my encounter with the knife wielding gentleman last week. Not to disparage my all American buddies but I suspect that, physically, there is little that they can do that I cannot.  We have established that Picard is a competition standard fencer. If there are Twentyfourth Century Olympics (On the experience of Seoul, I hope they will be a folk memory by then) his event would be a rather aristocratic version of modern pentathalon; fencing, shooting, riding, bobsled, etc.  By the way, we carry phasers from time to time. Did Starfleet Academy instruct us in their use and do we have to keep in training? Is there a shooting range on the ship? Might we see our good Captain taking half an hour of practice?  Picard has a sense of humour. Let's use it where ever possible; irony, understatement, e.g. ""It's called The Blue Parrot and your buying."", ""How comforting."", to the reassurance that the crew will not hang him. I am awfully solemn a lot of the time and that is one step from being boring.  Relationships. I feel they have been generalised and unspecific. That special relationship with Number One has not moved forward, nor been utilised. Picard is fascinated by Data, amused and intrigued. He should use him more imaginatively. Guinan was Picard's personal appointment. There was a reason and I assume that suggests a history. Please, let us not use up Whoopi's quota without examining that. I have yet to play a scene with Wil that was not a delight. (Have I ever told you what a fan I am of that young man?) I hope that I am not going to entirely lose him to Geordie, Riker and Guinan.  Might we sometime bring together Worf and Picard. For conversation that goes beyond giving and receiving orders.  Personal relationships. Private, intimate, call them what you will. They are at zero level so far this season. I know there is a school of thought that a Picard/Crusher relationship never existed but I am a little puzzled by this as I spent hours in front of the camera last season assuming - and acting - that it did. Certainly my mail bag confrims this.The Jean Luc/Beverly topic being only surpassed in interest by the Jean Luc/Jim. It is only now, back into the work, that I realize B.Crusher's departure left a huge hole in the on-screen life of Picard. I think it needs filling with something.  That's it. I'd be very happy for this to circulate amongst those you think would be interested. Indeed very happy for it to be the basis of a meeting of us all sometime.  However, it is at least a warning of what happens if you give an actor a day off.   Ever,  Patrick  edit: A couple of typos."

startrek,3dyc7h,xmoses2003,8,Mon Jul 20 23:12:22 2015 UTC,I read this in Patrick Stewart's voice.
startrek,3dyc7h,mephij,90,Tue Jul 21 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"I posted this in the /r/television thread, but found it interesting enough to post here, as well.  The ""Phaser Range"" first appears in episode 2x08, ""A Matter Of Honor"" where Picard and Riker are practicing. It seems this letter was written shortly after 2x06 ""The Schizoid Man"" was filmed (Which was 5th in production order, referenced in the letter as ""Graves/Data"").  So not only were Stewart's comments incorporated into the show, they were incorporated almost immediately. I'm sure the shooting script for ""A Matter Of Honor"" had to be retooled at the last minute to add the scene in the shooting range, the set built, etc. Unless, of course, it was always planned to have the scene and it's just coincidence that Stewart suggests it jut weeks before it appears in an episode."
startrek,3dyc7h,Antithesys,81,Mon Jul 20 16:14:56 2015 UTC,The scene's only purpose is to have Picard ask Riker to transfer to the Klingon ship. That could have been done in the ready room. It was almost certainly rewritten to appease Stewart's wishes.
startrek,3dyc7h,phrodo913,58,Mon Jul 20 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"And it made it awesome!  The Captain and First Officer sharpening their skills together, discussing a mission that would clearly be a challenge, and ultimately required use of similarly sharp tactical skill by both officers to get through it alive.  Delivering that scene in the ready room with a cup of tea would have been entirely deflating by comparison."

startrek,3dyc7h,mmarkklar,5,Tue Jul 21 13:42:01 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't agree with that. I think Worf's story in DS9 is just a realization of what he has always wanted: acceptance by his Klingon peers as an honorable warrior. Sure, he saves his family's honor in TNG. But other Klingons still see him as an outsider. Because Worf grew up with humans, he sort of has this idealized version of what it means to be Klingon. This is why I love when they start pairing him with Martok in DS9, a grizzled veteran who had to fight his way to power through Klingon society. He is more or less jaded toward the ""honorable Klingon way"", and many times where Worf sees some honorable struggle, Martok would just see it as petty politics and posturing. Toward the end, when Worf joins Martok's house, he is getting what he has always wanted: a proper place in Klingon society.  Through the dominion war arc, he gets to solidify that place with victories in a true battle.  Yes, DS9 had a lot of the heavy overbearing warrior stuff that people hate.  But the only time we really see the Klingons in that series is during an actual war.  I would imagine that the warrior culture just goes into overdrive in that situation."
startrek,3dyc7h,sfitsea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I feel like they used Worf to sell DS9. They threw away absolutely every bit of charactert hey built in TNG, and then went in at the end and tried to duct tape it all together.    ""Alexander, I am your father; I've only abandoned you at every turn!""  ""I didn't turn into an emo puddle of mush over Jadzia in a terrible, if edgy, love story."" ""I am Klingon. RAWR!"""

So, in season 2 it was Maurice Hurley who basically ran the show. Gene was already taking more of a backseat at that time. And it was Maurice who was adamant that they stay true to Gene's ""no conflict"" directive with regards to the main characters. So much so that Maurice would get in arguments with Gene about Gene's own vision!  Maurice might have been the father of the Borg, but it sounds like he had even less sense for drama and characterization than Gene did.

This letter was a polite way of him saying ""listen guys, you've got some great actors here, but I'm fucking Patrick Stewart.""  I'd say most if not all of Picard's great episodes occur after this letter; ""Measure of a Man"" was probably already written by then but it must have driven home Stewart's point. By season three you have him meddling in Klingon affairs and mentoring Data, and most of Wesley's development now came under Picard's tutelage.

Voyager took very few risks over its run and the main thing that kept it watchable for me was the Delta Quadrant angle. It wasn't daring material but at least it was new material. Six seasons of Voyager in the Alpha Quadrant would've been a TNG/DS9 hybrid but not as good as either of those shows given the IMO, weaker writing of Voyager.  IMO, it would've been better if they made it back to the Alpha Quadrant with only 1, maybe 2 max, seasons remaining. That would've opened up the potential for some better character stories with the crew returning to their ""normal"" lives. But then what happens with the former Maquis? The Doctor? Seven? I think that would've been great."

I think that was good enough given they wrapped up the series in two episodes.  With that said, if they had all of season 7, heck, just the last 6-9 episodes dealing with their return home, then I would like to see a more detailed story of the crew back home. But there is no way they could've done a good job doing so with just two episodes."
startrek,3e2d3d,readwrite_blue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:50 2015 UTC,I've thought about this. I think it would have been great. A season in the Alpha quadrant would have allowed us to explore the future of the federation post-war. The idea that being stranded in a hostile quadrant preserved federation ideals better than a war did could have been really compelling - having Voyager and the crew's notoriety allow Janeway to shape reconstruction for the better and return Starfleet to its pre-war values.

The Excelsior class was long lived at 80/90 years of service.  If the Constitution had lasted until the 2360s or the Dominion War of the 2370s the ships would have been over 120-130+ years old.  Compare how the Miranda class, a ship 30 years newer than the Constitution, were like canon fodder.  The constitution class were just to old to keep around. By the time you try upgrading them again its easier to make a new ship with all the latest bells and whistles built in.   As illustrated in that DS9 episode when a Galaxy-class starship got lit up by one little fighter with the loss of thousands of crew members   Actually we only see one destroyed in DS9. The USS Odyssey was taking on 3 ships, without shields, and still survived a 10+ minute firefight in a shape that it could retreat.  The Dominion had to suicide ram the thing to take it out.  Real World:  From what I have read, production didn't like using Hero ships on other shows.  The Constitution and Sovereign never cross.  The Intrepid class is seen only once or twice in DS9.  The Defiant Class is seen in Voyager once.  The Galaxy class isn't really used in DS9 until after TNG ended (and more after the 1701-D is destroyed).  Edit:  Also, one reason the Excelsior got so much screen time in TNG was because the model was made for the Movies and was very high quality.  Making new models was expensive, and not always to the same detail.  For example we don't see a lot of Ambassador classes around because the model was rushed and not as detailed.  They also never made a CGI model for it, so it doesn't show up in fleet battles in DS9 either."

I share many of your favourite episodes, but I always hold up two as examples of just how damn good Voyager can be - Counterpoint and Someone to Watch Over Me. Two episodes built purely around clever writing and great acting, executed perfectly.   Kate Mulgrew describes the former as her favourite Voyager episode, and I can certainly see why. She did such a good job with the character, even with inconsistent writing. Janeway was approachable, as you say, but also incredibly kick-arse at times - The Chute and Equinox part 2 are two classic examples."

It's not bad, but light years away from tos or tng. Some decent episodes and writing but the characters just don't have the chemistry of the other series. I thought ds9 had great characters but poor writing and poor premise. What made tos great were the characters and the sense of family along with amazing writing in my opinion. One last thing, I think Janeway was weak and dumb. Seven is right. Too many risk and too much aversion to firing weapons.

Some of the answers in this thread are great scenes for people who have seen a lot of Trek, and are interesting because they're outliers in some way. They're peak moments of intensity that are effective to us because they're cathartic releases of things that have been building up over an episode or multiple episodes. They're not necessarily typical, and don't give a good sense of what the general appeal of the shows are.   The scene from ""Who Watches the Watchers"" is good on its own because it functions as a mission statement for Starfleet, and also gets right at the core of Picard as a character. If you see this and it speaks to you, I'd feel pretty confident that you would at least enjoy watching TNG."

There are some that you can easily look at them and say ""yeah, sure, this happened,"" but I don't know if anyone official has ever said if they are ""canon."" The generally accepted principle is that anything that is on screen is canon (with the possible exception of Threshold which even the producers would rather forget). Deleted scenes didn't make it on screen, and could therefor be considered non-canon.  The debate gets muddier when you consider that there are multiple versions of some of the films and episodes. There is a directors cut DVD of Wrath of Khan that has several scenes that were not in the theatrical cut (which appears on the blu ray). Are those scenes canon or not? Same thing with the extended cut of ""Measure of a Man"" on the TNG Season 2 blu ray. I'm not the arbitrator of such things, so I'm not making a pronouncement either way.  Personally, however, I like this scene and Stephen Culp is awesome. I like to think that the Enterprise soared off to new adventures with new first officer Marvin Madden, Daniels (from First Contact and Insurrection) as security chief and the cute Trill from Insurrection at Ops."

startrek,3e08k1,Rimulus,5,Mon Jul 20 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"Gambit was a two-parter, but it could have been more. Imagine a whole season with Riker (and later Data) in command while Picard is held captive.  Instead of the Enterprise being able to focus on getting Picard back, they have no clues where he is and Starfleet needs the Enterprise to complete other missions. Of course the crew won't give up on their captain, so the search for Picard is always there in the background.  Maybe half-way into the season, they find a clue and manage to catch up with the ship holding Picard, but Riker ends up captured too.  Meanwhile, we have a real chance to get to know the pirate crew. Some episodes won't even feature the Enterprise. We'll actually care about those people even though they're criminals at odds with Starfleet.  Back on the Enterprise, the crew will have to adapt to having Data in command, not just for half an episode but half a season. He won't behave like Picard or Riker. There will be prejudice against taking orders from a machine. This may grow over time as tension rises after the loss of Picard and Riker.  Eventually though, ceaseless research by Data and the rest of the crew reveals what the pirates are after and they are finally able to set a trap. In a climactic season finale, the pirates are defeated and Picard and Riker rescued.  But the dynamics of the bridge crew are changed. Part of Picard actually enjoyed the life of a pirate. Data has to adapt to no longer being in command. Of course he adapts more quickly than a human would under similar circumstances, but he had to alter his programming to be a better commander and he doesn't choose to reverse all those changes. The crew also have to get used to Picard all over again."

It is a bit odd why the Stafleet Flagship wasn't immediately taken over, though you have to factor in that the Enterprise was out of reach on the frontier, and there is some suggestion that the Neural Parasites were limited in number."

startrek,3e1vlq,TheDudeNeverBowls,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:58 2015 UTC,"It was the Trek I grew up on.  It started when I was 12.  I knew enough about Trek to be a bit disdainful at the idea of a bald captain and a Klingon on the bridge.  Obviously I was wrong :)  The show ended when I was 19.  I watched the last episode over two nights while living on a USN guided missile cruiser.  Everyone in the berthing was there, with me front and center.  The memory makes me want to tear up. I was new to the ship, and one of the youngest guys around.  There were guys standing for the whole hour watching, but they let me sit front and center because I was so excited to watch ""All Good Things..."" To be fair, we were all going to watch it anyway, but those dudes made sure I could see it because by that time they all knew how important the show was to that young man that was me.  It really was a coming of age moment that I haven't really thought about until a few moments ago when I started typing.  It's no surprise then, that show helped make me become the man I am today.  I was a Navy man during the series finale of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I am very much another man now, yet this show has remained an integral part of my life.  Wow, you now know me better than most of the people in my life.  Thank you for reading this, it was a good thing for me to write."

I would really like you're insight into how the show as a whole made you feel, and especially where you were emotionally when you saw it end.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Heck, if you have any questions, or you just want to share in a spoiler-free environment about how any scene made you feel, I'll be here.  I have and still watch a shitload of television in all the genres. Fiction, especially television fiction is my thing.  In saying that, Star Trek: The Next Generation is my all time favorite show.  Sure, Breaking Bad may be better overall, but TNG wins in so many ways to me on a personal level. I was Data, Geordi, and a little bit /u/wil. This show was my childhood and the beginning of my adulthood.  Wow, I was really lucky to have such an amazing show as an integral part of my formative years :)"

Sadly, much of the time on TOS and TNG, they sure didn't. They opened as soon as you approached the door... unless you had to pause and say something dramatically -then they waited to open until you were done. OR they sensed you entering so they opened, but then you fell backwards to lean against the door and it just instinctively knew and so stayed closed lest you fall into the hallway. No, this was great. This was an attempt to make them real and I loved it. Now if only they could have taught Frakes how to make an omelet so I believed he handled the cooking all the time.

I hear Gates McFadden once say that for the entire first season she thought the show was a comedy. I can't say I blame her. It wasn't at all handled the way it should have been.

startrek,3dtwoz,DnMarshall,3,Sun Jul 19 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"she apparently played a lt. cmdr. dr ann muhall in TOS as well.  I don't remember her at all, even after seeing her as Dr Pulaski in TNG"
startrek,3dtwoz,andhelostthem,32,Sun Jul 19 14:43:59 2015 UTC,I thought she was awesome.  Got back to that Bones chemistry that I liked so much from TOS.  I actually preferred her to Crusher.  I know I'm waaaaay in the minority on that one.
startrek,3dtwoz,skonen_blades,14,Sun Jul 19 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Pulaski, I liked her. She would have been great if she had another 5 seasons to the end. A lot of mileage in that character, and an excellent actress who would have delivered."
startrek,3dtwoz,DnMarshall,20,Sun Jul 19 16:29:42 2015 UTC,I thought Bones came across like a lovable curmudgeon and Pulaski came off as a bigot. I don't know why there is a difference to me but there is...
startrek,3dtwoz,rumborak,5,Sun Jul 19 17:57:43 2015 UTC,And that Grandma haircut was pretty awful.
startrek,3dtwoz,debianite,4,Sun Jul 19 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Yeah, I can dig that.  I never picked up on the bigot angle but here interactions with Data definitely had that edge."
startrek,3dtwoz,charlieglide,8,Sun Jul 19 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"The difference could be because Spock's personhood/rights were never really in question while Data's definitely were. There were higher stakes with Polaski.  Or, it could be that McCoy's relationship with Kirk showed his humanity and connected him to the audience in a way that Polaski never did.  Either way I view their similar views very differently..."
startrek,3dtwoz,SemSevFor,5,Sun Jul 19 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"This, absolutely. Partially it was his older age I think, but I think the key difference between Bones and Pulaski was that Bones was so obviously flawed, which made his cantankerous mood so amusing. Pulaski on the other hand was pitched as a perfect person (top of her field etc) so when she would lash out at Data, it came across as mean."
startrek,3dtwoz,MrBookX,14,Sun Jul 19 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. Pulaski was great - she never came across as a fedbot, she thought on her feet and had her own opinions. Crusher was bland in comparison."
startrek,3dtwoz,squints_at_stars,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Pulaski had an edge, but some people apparently misinterpreted that as being annoying. Crusher was nice to look at, but hardly an interesting character."
startrek,3dtwoz,MrBookX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know about some people, but I began to tolerate her by the end of her tenure.  She definitely pissed me off less when she was getting to her last few episodes."
startrek,3dtwoz,Inspiderface,9,Mon Jul 20 08:26:23 2015 UTC,They were trying to create a Bones like character and just really missed the mark.
startrek,3dtwoz,_IBM_,17,Sun Jul 19 17:30:57 2015 UTC,I would argue that they didn't miss it by as much as people say. It seems to me that there's a significant amount of sexism in how her character is perceived.
startrek,3dtwoz,MrBookX,11,Sun Jul 19 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point, but the reason Bones worked so well was because he had Spock to work with. Polanski didn't have a proper Spock (though they tried with Data) and so she just comes off as being a negative asshat most of the time."
startrek,3dtwoz,Gregrox,11,Sun Jul 19 16:08:35 2015 UTC,That really was the problem. She came across as picking on the childlike data and the fans weren't having it.
startrek,3dtwoz,AmbassadorAtoz,3,Sun Jul 19 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"I think they wrote her a little too preachy - she rarely has actions as a good character does, but she comments and speaks a bunch of nothing about polarizing ethical opinions. One notable exception is 2x07 - ""Unnatural Selection"" when she takes the genetically modified man-boy into a shuttle to examine him (against Picard's orders) and quickly starts dying - although it was a stupid and irritating choice at least it was a choice and an action."
startrek,3dtwoz,nesagwa,4,Sun Jul 19 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"I've never thought about that before. She really doesn't do much besides talk. At least Crusher occasionally DID something, and she was likable on top of that. Also, Crusher had that BITCHIN jacket no other Starfleet member seemed to wear."

startrek,3dtwoz,Steffi_van_Essen,11,Sun Jul 19 15:38:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm still mad at her for how she treated Data.
startrek,3dtwoz,BadgerMk1,10,Sun Jul 19 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"And yet by the end of the season her and Data were relatively good friends. Pulaski's pretty much the only character we got to see any real character development out of. We got to see back stories filled out on a few others, but she's the only one that really changed as her tenure progressed, and if McFadden hadn't buried the hatchet with Roddenberry and returned to the show, likely would have continued to develop and (IMHO) likely become a fan favorite."
startrek,3dtwoz,anonymous_subroutine,3,Sun Jul 19 16:05:05 2015 UTC,Kind of like how the doctor in voyager was one of the few character to get some growth and is one of the best of the show
startrek,3dtwoz,DefiniteMethAddict,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"Totally. In the episode Pen Pals I recall, she is the only one on Data's side."

startrek,3dtwoz,Zarnywoop,4,Sun Jul 19 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"It does know how to do these things, doesn't it?"
startrek,3dtwoz,DefiniteMethAddict,3,Sun Jul 19 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think her character highlights some fo the human difficulties we see in everyday society. I find it difficult sometimes to adjust to someone who is, for example, transgender, who might suddenly wish to referred to in the opposing gender. That's coming from someone who finds that change difficult in general, but it's an interesting concept to explore.   Of course, that might not be the underlying idea behind Polaski's character in ST:NG, but I think it can very well be applied. Hell, we're exploring AI as it is, we might well have an equivalent to Data in a reasonably short space of time."
startrek,3dtwoz,alnarra,4,Sun Jul 19 18:30:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm still mad at her for how she treated Data.   You mean Data. One is his name. The other is not.
startrek,3dtwoz,demonkobra,5,Sun Jul 19 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"Hard to define, but many reasons.  Her voice.  The way she delivers her lines, mostly.  She doesn't say something, makes pronouncements.  She announces it, like everything she has to say is a divine revelation.  There's no subtlety, no nuance to her delivery.  her cold glassy stare gives me the creeps.  I can't stand her."
startrek,3dtwoz,regeya,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"I sometimes wonder if this is the intention behind casting her. There are occasional flashes of directional brilliance in many star trek episodes/films, perhaps this is one we should take on merit."

Every episode, every scene was used as an opportunity to make a self righteous commentary on how different 24th century humans were compared to the ""past"" (contemporary times) and/or the rest of the ST universe.   Every body thinks of Roddenberry as this idealistic optimist but if you really think about it, he hated everything that makes humans human. He actually was incredibly pessimistic."

Season 2 had a couple of the best episodes of Star Trek and a few of the worst.   It looks so unbelievably dated.
startrek,3dtwoz,jump_the_snark,4,Sun Jul 19 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"Well, consider this: Season 2 was filmed in 1989 - 26 years ago - with a late 80's TV show budget (before TNG really got into gear, too). So. . .yeah, it makes sense that it looks dated. The original Star Wars films look dated, too, and so does most everything from the 80's. It's only when you start getting into the 90's with the 'good' CGI that some stuff stops looking quite so dated. . .take Star Trek: First Contact, for example. They released that in 1996, yet it doesn't really look that old (it'll be 20 years old next year). You could almost swear it was made in the mid 2000's, instead."
startrek,3dtwoz,switch182,2,Sun Jul 19 17:22:06 2015 UTC,The thing that always gets me with the VFX in First Contact is the Earth model. It looks so unrealistic when all the other VFX model work is done so well.

It's true what he says that an actor ultimately has a kind of veto: you might be in breach of contract by refusing to say a line, but you can deliver it however weakly or insincerely you want and they can't do a thing.   Now, whether an actor should do that is debatable..."

I can't recall the specific episode, but they really were just Data 2.0 or C-3PO lines.      I'm sure you know this, but actors vetoing a production decision happened before on Star Trek.

Voyager-Threshold.  I get it. UPN couldn't afford the technical consultants that TNG had, but this is offensive.

Lots of attitudes that may seem normal or even outdated 50 years later were cutting edge at the time. In 2015, it may seem weird to think that having Uhura on the bridge was revolutionary when she mostly was a glorified phone operator, but in 1966, it was pretty risky and impressive, at a time when a lot of people still thought women belonged at home and segregation was acceptable."

It looks into the unfairness of gender inequality and how unequal opportunity destroys a life.  The gender swap is pretty edgy for 1969 too. While it seems insane women would be unable to command in the 23rd century, it forces us to acknowledge how dumb inequality is in this century.  Not the greatest ep by any means but pretty provocative."

startrek,3dv4jr,DefiniteMethAddict,2,Sun Jul 19 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, there's a kind of separate book canon that has developed in recent years from authors all kind of deciding to attempt to stay in the same continuity, helped by the fact that they're all published by Pocketbooks due to its monopoly on Star Trek book licensing.  There's this Lit-Trek reading order chart that kind of shows the continuity occurring and the different books that share a common universe. New Frontier in particular seems to make a lot of cameo appearances in the Lit-Trek canon simply because of its unique position of being an entirely original story, versus the other books that borrow characters and plots from the TV series and movies.  TV Tropes also has an entire page on the so-called ""Star Trek Novel Verse."""
startrek,3dv4jr,Trekky0623,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"The only books which are even close to TV canon are the couple of Voyager books by Jeri Taylor, which had some aspects integrated into the show. Books stood alone for quite a while, although some authors would use the same original characters and races in a few of their books, but more recently they have had a level of continuity with each other.  Writers were told to avoid things which could contradict future TV plots - for instance, Peter David wanted to have Troi and Riker get engaged at the end of Imzadi II, but the studio refused to let him do that (then, of course, it happened in Insurrection very soon after).  I also liked Peter David's habit of, as he put it, weaving together the tapestry of Star Trek and connecting various elements. Q-Squared is a fine example, delving into the background of Trelane and some of the anomalies featured in TOS.  A few other books do that - the Q trilogy by Greg Cox, for instance, which also provides backstory for a lot of TOS events, and Q & A which gives backstory for Q's TNG appearances.  Incidentally, in case you didn't see it, there's some new New Frontier novellas coming out."
startrek,3dw7je,wyntereign,3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:56 2015 UTC,This happened in voyager a couple times. All major species are familiar with universal translators so they don't need to question it.

startrek,3dw7je,Herdnerfer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"There is a science to language that i assume the Human Race has mastered by the 24th century.  Translators can pick up on word structure and inflection and know what the other people are saying.    Obviously the science of how is going to be a bit fuzzy, as it is really just a story telling mechanism to leap over an obvious Hurdle. Enterprise handled it pretty well also."
startrek,3dw7je,juandh,0,Mon Jul 20 01:42:52 2015 UTC,"This makes no sense. There are several species the Enterprise encounters that they cannot communicate with. This is a moot point.

startrek,3dw7je,Multivers,3,Mon Jul 20 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Any alien trying to blend in would spy/wiretap/whatever and learn the language that way.

startrek,3dw7je,juandh,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"Again... sigh I'm talking about first contact with a new alien species. Several times the crew has to find some other way of communicating with them, like the Darmok episode, but others they just show up on an alien world and start talking to the aliens they've never met before. Then in turn the aliens never question why the alien is speaking their language fluently. Even though they themselves as the alien don't have translators. Is everyone in this thread missing my point?"
startrek,3dw7je,Herdnerfer,2,Mon Jul 20 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"It would just be an empty scene that has no purpose in driving the story forward:   ""Hi guys from space, how is it you can speak our language?""

I asked for a refund on the first day after it was clear within a couple hours on the floor and two very bad quality talks that I had wasted my time and money. They refused. I traveled to London just for the event. There were a LOT of unhappy people on site in my experience, and lots of requests for refunds if the internet is to be believed.

I certainly would stay away from buying expensive bonus tickets and the like as it is a rip off, but standard entry was fine as there was not much to go wrong with that and there were plenty of free talks.  The opening ceremony was a joke cost-wise though, I didn't go to that - it was something like £100 for a 90 min ceremony - over a pound a minute! Funk that! And they had Jonathan Ross MC'ing!?

The expensive talks I paid for were horrible, overcrowded, and had bad sound. The tiered system rewarded rich people with money to burn while making it a miserable slog for everyone else, and really only the very expensive top level ticket package got any sort of normal experience that you would get at any other convention. They had clearly hand picked some from that front row group for questions unlike every other convention I have ever been to where anyone can queue up. The rest of us were in steerage asking each other ""what did he/she say?"" They were cramming chairs in to every space as they had sold more tickets than they had room for people. I don't know if everyone got in but it was full up against the back wall with portable chairs slightly overlapping each other.  If they would have refunded me I could get over it. But I paid a LOT of money for what I thought would be a once in a lifetime experience with certain people together and me having the time to go...and it was incredibly disappointing.

startrek,3dr5wk,drogyn1701,90,Sun Jul 19 03:00:49 2015 UTC,"Characters and their development is what makes a great TV show, and I think we forget that when we view TNG through rose-colored VISORs.  It was a good show, but half the crew - Troi, LaForge, Crusher, and Riker - had no characterization past what you'd find with anyone in their generic role.  Hey, the doctor cares about people!  Hey, the second in command is a brash go-getter!  Hey, the engineer is smart at engineering!  Their equivalents - Kira, O'Brien, and Bashir - on DS9 were actual in-depth characters that changed over the series.  DS9's secondary characters were deeper than half of TNG's main cast.  Look at Rom, or Nog, Dukat, Kai Winn, or Garak!"
startrek,3dr5wk,emdeemcd,42,Sat Jul 18 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. Picard, Data, and Worf became the main attractions but consider who they were-the Captain who speaks with the voice of the Federation, the stoic robot struggling to understand humans and become more like them in spite of his inherent physical and brain function superiority, and the alien orphan raised by the former enemies of his people who must find his place, his balance, between the two.   Compare them to the mostly well adjusted humans on the crew and you realize where the writing potential was.   The appeal in DS9's secondary characters was that they went against expectations-I thoroughly expected Garak to betray and murder multiple people during the series and he never did (except that one time and I found it pretty inexcusable, but that was just another Trek ethics conundrum) Instead of the Captain's son enlisting, it was the nephew of the profit obsessed little jerkwad. The shapeshifter did not forsake duty for love in the one instance it would have been forgiveable, instead doing his duty no matter what. Hell, even Worf forsook the traditional Klingon path to power for the good of a people he was frankly better than, a people that had by and large treated him with disdain, a people he owed NOTHING to.   Now THAT was good TV."
startrek,3dr5wk,remmick,22,Sat Jul 18 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"The strength of TNG was not the characters but the actors who played them. Picard as a character was AWFUL until Patrick stewart just grabbed the reins aND took him over.  Data is insipid, but Brent Spiner plays him so beautifully you still loved him.."
startrek,3dr5wk,amazondrone,2,Sun Jul 19 03:42:04 2015 UTC,Data is insipid   Yeah? Why do you think that?
startrek,3dr5wk,remmick,5,Sun Jul 19 12:09:23 2015 UTC,"Not having the ability to use contractions or understand idioms. I mean c'mon. Of course he got better with time, but when Q accuses Picard of ""indulging Data in his witless exploration of humanity"" I kind of go ""Yeah, he's right!"""
startrek,3dr5wk,Mozared,2,Sun Jul 19 14:15:39 2015 UTC,"I think that, at least in part, the strength of TNG (as well as VOY and ENT, really) is the situations the characters are placed in. It's true that there wasn't a lot of development with individual characters, but with the sheer amount of moral dilemma's they were placed in this didn't matter as much as it would with any other show. If one character is always rough and stoic, it's still interesting to see how that character deals with serious ethical issues - will they remain stoic? Is a stoic position untenable? Does a compromise have to be made? In a way, you can view most of Star Trek (minus DS9) as a 'what if' scenario with the characters embodying certain ethical stances. This is, imo, also why the episodes that do not have moral dilemma's are often the ones disliked by most of the fanbase: they are mostly just predictable 'soap' style stories where one character is placed in a situation where we know exactly how he'll react. In this sense, DS9 is just a different beast from the other Star Trek series.   I would say both approaches have their charm. Could regular Star Trek be improved with more character development? Yeah, probably. But the thing to take into account is also that these moral dilemma's were often at the forefront of the series, and that having characters truly 'develop' without just making them flip-flop in every scenario (""this guy was introduced as the stoic one, but he'll fight any decision he dislikes at the blink of an eye - so really, what drives him?"") may detract from the issues these dilemma's posit. You'd get a lot of scenario's where, for example, the Doctor just agrees with the captain that helping a sick race on a planet is too dangerous, and the star-ship just pisses off. That wouldn't be very interesting."
startrek,3dr5wk,readwrite_blue,24,Sun Jul 19 12:49:31 2015 UTC,"While I agree these are strengths of DS9, I don't mind that there was less in-depth character development on TNG. It was a more imaginative, inventive and adventurous show. The fact that it was more shallow in character progression wasn't a weakness, it's just a different kind of show. How lucky are we to have both in the same franchise!?"
startrek,3dr5wk,MV2049,17,Sat Jul 18 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. DS9 is my favorite, but TNG captures the spirit of wonder in a way that no other Trek did."
startrek,3dr5wk,LukeFL,6,Sat Jul 18 23:59:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that's true. TOS is much more focussed on exploration and has a much stronger wild unknown aesthetic.
startrek,3dr5wk,rezanow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:17:03 2015 UTC,"I think a fair amount of that was the result of the writing - DS9 had longer story arcs, whereas TNG was episodic. Unfortunately, the style that worked for DS9 didn't for Enterprise, yet worked for Battlestar Galactica (although, BSG's relative success could be the writers/quality as opposed to the style).   I think the inventiveness and adventurous feel of TNG was related to its episodic style. DS9 took the time to develop the characters because they did the same with the story (longer arcs, direct involvement in what would typically be Star Trek background story). I don't know that these two styles are mutually exclusive, but it has played out that way."
startrek,3dr5wk,johnnyfog,4,Sun Jul 19 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"The fact that it was more shallow in character progression wasn't a weakness, it's just a different kind of show.  That is debatable.  The elements that made TNG a ratings monster are the same foibles that made much of it forgettable.  As with VOY."
startrek,3dr5wk,readwrite_blue,11,Sun Jul 19 04:45:45 2015 UTC,Strong writing and acting is what powered TNG. Lack of strong writing and acting is what made Voyager more forgettable.
startrek,3dr5wk,metakepone,3,Sun Jul 19 06:36:22 2015 UTC,There are stories in Voyager that are worth their weight in sci fi gold. I think the acting would have been there if the concepts were fleshed out better by the writers. Than and Voyager was way too episodic.
startrek,3dr5wk,readwrite_blue,3,Sun Jul 19 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"I say this all the time, but episodic wouldn't be a problem if the episodes themselves were better. Voyager had moments of brilliance - where a good idea was written well and the stronger actors in the cast were able to shine.  You're right, the best episodes of Voyager rank among the best Trek. The problem was too many episodes felt phoned in from conception to execution."

Yes, and if you consider they also started with Tasha Yar, it's really stunning how many of the characters were almost interchangeable Generic Starfleet Officers. Meanwhile, on DS9, were there any Generic Starfleet Officers?"

startrek,3dr5wk,CelestialFury,5,Sun Jul 19 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"I imagine DS9 was that remote outpost where you get sent to watch your Starfleet career fade and die. Like, you know you did something wrong to get assigned here. So, yeah, I can imagine an entire crew of what the rest of Starfleet would consider riff-raff to some degree or another. Made for a damn good show."
startrek,3dr5wk,Jrlhath,3,Sun Jul 19 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I always thought deep space assignments were for either specialists studying that area or people who wanted a certain period of stability.  Sisko went to DS9 so he could raise Jake in relative peace.   Most of Sisko's staff had pretty sterling records and they had the arguably best doctor in Star Fleet.  Worf had a few negative comments on his record, but he's still one of the best officers in Star Fleet.  But DS9 is a hub for outcasts as well.  Garak, Odo, Quark, Rom, and plenty of shady individuals."
startrek,3dr5wk,forward4,4,Sun Jul 19 23:29:59 2015 UTC,"Sisko went to DS9 against his wishes originally and even thought about resigning.  Bashir went because he was enamored with the frontier and possibly to hide his genetic engineering.  Worf went once the station had become prominent due to the wormhole and the Klingon situation (and because Troi crashed the enterprise).  O'Brien went for the opportunity to be chief of operations, a position he would never achieve as an enlisted man on a starship.  They were all pretty unique situations, and none of them at the beginning would have been considered top officers in starfleet.  I really don't think deep space postings are considered top assignments at all."
startrek,3dr5wk,MattTheRicker,19,Mon Jul 20 07:53:06 2015 UTC,"I enjoy TNG so much because I don't care really about internal struggle or character development - they're the highest officers on the Federation's flagship, they're not going to have a lot of interpersonal problems or somehow need to overcome something within themselves to be better officers. They are the best of the Federation, and I think that is appropriate. I enjoy the conflict between the best of the Federation and whatever space can throw at them, because I enjoy seeing experts in their fields operate with efficiency and success. In the real world, I don't think such an expert crew would have enough character flaws to merit focus on them in a television show, simply because those character flaws would disqualify them from being a part of the mission. That is how we choose astronauts here on Earth, they are truly a cut above the rest because of their ability to come to terms with and put aside their own internal problems and work together as a part of the crew."

startrek,3dr5wk,rezanow,7,Sun Jul 19 13:23:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was that the Next Gen characters were especially cliche or bland.  Its more that Next Gen was an episodic show and DS9 was a serialized show.  In Next Gen, there is clearly character development.  Yes, the characters have set expectations (Riker likes the women, Worf rushes to fight, Picard loves to hide in his ready room, etc).  But all the characters clearly go beyond their set cliches, though sometimes not in a good way coughCrusher and Crushercough.  But as someone who prefers serialized series more than episodic, I still have to say that both have their place.  If anything, Star Trek is one of the few shows which has been able to jump between both mediums.  And while I think DS9 has the best ongoing plot and flow, I don't know if I can say it has the absolute best character dynamic.  Its kind of hard to beat the traditional trio of Kirk/Spock/McCoy, since they can work in almost any setting or story.  And in Next Gen, they had such a large cast, you weren't always stuck with just watching the same 3-5 people as the focus of every story.  A lot of the things DS9 is loved for actually started in Next Gen.  Especially ongoing story arcs and secondary characters having entire episodes devoted to them.  As Miles proved to do both, then got a major role in DS9."

A lot of the things DS9 is loved for actually started in Next Gen. Especially ongoing story arcs and secondary characters having entire episodes devoted to them.   I loved it when TNG did that, and I loved when DS9 did that. When BSG came out, and I realized that many of my favorite episodes in TNG and DS9 had the same names attached to the production."

startrek,3dr5wk,Organia,15,Sat Jul 18 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"There's really no character development in TOS (not counting the movies), because there's no continuity. You can watch the entirety of TOS in any episode order and it will still make sense."

startrek,3dr5wk,Luomulanren,3,Sat Jul 18 20:10:57 2015 UTC,"There are great episodes for Spock ""Amok Time"" and Kirk ""Obsession"" just among the few where you really explore what makes them tick. Nimoy especially gave nuanced multilayered performances."
startrek,3dr5wk,OhManTFE,26,Sat Jul 18 20:58:51 2015 UTC,DS9 is the most misunderstood Star Trek series. Almost everyone who watched it later realized just how good it is but unfortunately it didn't receive the attention it deserved when it first aired.
startrek,3dr5wk,metakepone,6,Sat Jul 18 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"I am of the same camp. I saw DS9 and was like 'eww no' when I was a kid. I'm up to season 4 right now as an adult and I'm really loving the storyline-over-multiple-episodes technique that was never employed in TNG or VOY.  I think what turned me off most as a kid was when you saw it it didn't look anything like a Star Trek show. It was set on a Cardassian Station, not Federation - so the aesthetic looked completely different. And it had none of the typical Star Trek races in the main cast (Vulcan, Klingon, or even Romulan). Instead we had these ""Cardassians"" and ""Bajorans"" and ""Ferengi"", all of which were pretty minor in the Star Trek universe until DS9."
startrek,3dr5wk,CX316,4,Sun Jul 19 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"I had the same experiences as a kid. I would watch TNG and then DS9 would come on after, and I would just turn off the tv. What kind of ship is that? And why is everything so dark?"
startrek,3dr5wk,dominion47,13,Sun Jul 19 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"That's mostly because the show really started to shine post-9/11 and once America went to war. Seriously go back and watch the start of season 4, and listen to the Klingons. A lot of the stuff they spout makes you think ""These guys are being really heavy handed with their post 9/11 rhetoric"" with their reasons for attempting to invade Cardassia and the claims about Cassidy's freighter ""If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to worry about"", etc. And episodes like Paradise Lost.  Then you realise the show ended about 2 years before 9/11 so the heavy handed 9/11 references pre-dated the world actually looking like that by about 5 years."
startrek,3dr5wk,BagOfLazers,9,Sun Jul 19 04:07:49 2015 UTC,"AND when enterprise tried to incorporate 9/11 into it, it didn't work(for me) at all."
startrek,3dr5wk,Terris1979,4,Sun Jul 19 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah watching Enterprise veer hard to the political right was painful, and against the Trek spirit/vision whatever. I get that it's pre-federation but it's so cringeworthy to watch now."
startrek,3dr5wk,Terris1979,7,Sun Jul 19 06:58:20 2015 UTC,"OP, I agree that DS9 is hands-down my Trek favorite series as well.  I am not quite on board with your idea that Enterprise could've outshone it, given by the episodes we were left with. I was more a fan of the serialized stories from Season 3 and the mini-arc stories from Season 4.  In terms of characterization, my favorite character on DS9 was Garak. I loved his overall progression."
startrek,3dr5wk,joerdie,8,Sat Jul 18 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"I would argue that if ENT had continued with the 3-4 episode arcs and covered the Earth-Romulan war in Seasons 5 and 6 with the founding of the Federation in the 7th it would have been as good or better than DS9-by fleshing out the Romulans and founding members of the Federation as much as TNG and DS9 did for Klingons, Ferengi, Bajorans, and Cardassians, by showing the birth pangs of what would become the near-utopian oasis in a sea of exploitive interstellar empires."
startrek,3dr5wk,Legionary,3,Sat Jul 18 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...  When you put it that way, it sounds like a solid way to bridge the gap between that point and the original series.  And who knows? Maybe we would've seen the appearance of key diplomatic figures like Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek.  That may have well been the intent. But however, it was not meant to be.  And besides, I would've much preferred the series be titled anything else except ""Enterprise"". Maybe ""Star Trek: Odyssey"" instead..."
startrek,3dr5wk,garibaldi3489,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"To me that's the great shame of ENT. Had they done in season 2 what was do e I  season 3, the show would have probably run seven seasons. But those first two seasons are hard to watch."
startrek,3dr5wk,TheMathelm,4,Sun Jul 19 13:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly that. I always preferred TNG and VOY to DS9 when I was younger, but having rewatched all series as a mature(ish) adult DS9 is miles ahead. The characters all develop and the longer story arcs maintain a sense of progression and avoid villain-of-the-week syndrome."
startrek,3dr5wk,joerdie,6,Sat Jul 18 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Jeffrey Combs was fantastic.   You should try Babylon 5 next - it is also heavily character-driven and similar in a number of ways to DS9"
startrek,3dr5wk,garibaldi3489,2,Sun Jul 19 02:41:03 2015 UTC,"The pilot episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9) aired just weeks before Babylon 5 debuted. Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski indicated that Paramount Television was aware of his concept as early as 1989, when he attempted to sell the show to the studio, and provided them with the series bible, pilot script, artwork, lengthy character background histories, and plot synopses for 22 ""or so planned episodes taken from the overall course of the planned series"".  Paramount passed on Babylon 5, but later announced Deep Space Nine was in development, two months after Warner Bros. announced its plans for Babylon 5. Straczynski has stated on numerous occasions that, even though he is confident that Deep Space Nine producer/creators Rick Berman and Michael Piller did not see this material, he thinks Paramount may have used his bible and scripts to steer development of Deep Space Nine.

Space exploration/station was just the backdrop for the show.  I say this as a TNG fan first that got really interested into space due to the show.    The main purpose was studying the human condition, how we respond to adversity, and how we treat others.  Many times Star Trek used Spock, Data, Garak, Quark, Odo, and the Doctor as an outsider looking in, revealing parts of the human condition we never thought of before."

DS9 was not my preferred Trek while it aired - TNG was my Trek growing up, and I really just wanted more of that. Then I came back to DS9 when I was older and realized that it was pretty incredible. So many great standalone episodes, so many great arcs - and the character growth was awesome. I do feel as if it wouldn't have had nearly as much impact if not for TOS and TNG setting up the peaceful, optimistic, utopian Federation. The previous shows and movies gave DS9 a great backstory to contrast with its morally grey areas and war."
startrek,3dr5wk,CX316,9,Sat Jul 18 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"I was exposed to Star Trek as a kid through Enterprise on UPN and later TNG reruns on Spike TV, so perhaps I am attached to it more nostalgically than older fans. I recently rewatched it and though sometimes it wasn't great I found it to be by and large good Star Trek. TNG and DS9 weren't great until their fifth seasons and Enterprise wasn't allowed to go that long. Damn shame too because Jeffrey Combs on the bridge would have been Christmas every Friday night. I think it gets a bad rap for killing the franchise but I tell you the truth when I say so far, of the dozen Voyager episodes I've seen none of them have been good (but I'll try to get through that series later) and it has been said that Voyager shit the bed but Enterprise shouldered the blame.  That song was terrible though no matter what your thoughts are."
startrek,3dr5wk,jitasquatter,6,Sat Jul 18 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yikes, season five for TNG and DS9? I think they both figured it out by the finales of their third seasons - The Best of Both Worlds and The Adversary. And while TNG doesn't always hold up well to time I think DS9 aged pretty well too. But we can agree to disagree about just how wrong you are /s.  I agree about Voyager - it killed Trek on TV, but Enterprise got the blame. My understanding was that much of the end of Enterprise was heavily influenced by studio pressure (for what, I don't know) - which is part of why they had the ending they had, with the holodeck on the Enterprise D, for whatever that's worth. Definitely the worst song - WTF were they thinking."
startrek,3dr5wk,britishwookie,2,Sat Jul 18 22:16:03 2015 UTC,That ending didn't... just didn't happen. The studio didn't know what it was doing with Star Trek anymore and I think it was probably just a part of whatever led to the UPN/WB merger a couple of years later anyways.

Also there is the missed potential with the Maquis.  After the 2nd episode the Maquis and Starfleet crews have almost no conflict until they all get hypnotized by Tuvok."
startrek,3dr5wk,johnnyfog,3,Sat Jul 18 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"Not to mention a series that really should have been serialised and have the waning levels of supplies and increasing levels of damage to the ship be a major issue going through the show, instead becomes episodic so that very few things that occur in the show actually last beyond the end of their own episode (only real exceptions I can remember are the mobile holo-emitter, the removal of Kes, the addition of Seven and then Naomi Wildman.)"
startrek,3dr5wk,Orangemenace13,3,Sun Jul 19 04:13:28 2015 UTC,"They didn't even have a show bible with the very basic information of the crew compliment.

startrek,3dr5wk,BigTaker,3,Sun Jul 19 04:09:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, if ENT could have gone on for on more season with Combs as part of the crew we would have really started to get some interesting stories. Also, more of the 2 and 3 part shows so they can take their time to tell the story.  Another bonus of keeping it going would defiantly be seeing more of the stuff that leads to the founding of the Federation.  I would posit that we could have had most of this cool stuff if we didn't have the silly Xindi season 3 BS. Ditch all of that and let the characters that matter actually matter.ಠ_ಠಠ_ಠ"
startrek,3dr5wk,BigTaker,4,Sun Jul 19 12:13:58 2015 UTC,ENT may not have hit DS9 but it easily would have been better than TNG. It's 4th season is already better than any single TNG season and you could only expect it to get better in the next 3

In ""Paradise Lost"", Sisko took a stand and said, 'We're not going to win this war by sacrificing who we are' as a Norwegian flag practically unfurled behind him.    Now compare that to ENT, a show which aired post 911 and was couched in imagery from the war on terror.   Everyone who isn't an earthling on that show is automatically suspect. Fuck, even Reed isn't trustworthy, as if the frou frou accent should have tipped us off.  As time marches on, ENT will find new ways of embarrassing all of us.

startrek,3dr5wk,BigTaker,4,Sat Jul 18 18:14:48 2015 UTC,"I feel there were a lot of mistakes made in ENT. The Klingon thing I think was kind of an excuse to get the NX-01 out of there in a big way without the Vulcans crying about 'no experience keep them grounded for another decade or half century' (of course a lot of this holding back was Romulan influence)  It was an cheap and dirty way to kick off the plot. What was weak was the end of the TCW without the reveal of Future Guy. Also wasn't crazy about the Xindi arc, though going into the expanse was mostly fun. The show had a lot of potential that didn't get used, but it wasn't the worst and it was still Star Trek on TV, and god only know when we'll get that again."
startrek,3dr5wk,metakepone,8,Sat Jul 18 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"The Temporal Cold War seemed like an excuse to avoid some proper world building in the early days of humanity's expansion into space. I want to see Mars and alpha centauri, not a bunch of time-travelling to the past and future.    My major problem with the Xindi plot, mostly, was: Starfleet wasn't aware there was this massive region of thermobaric clouds and cosmic weirdness just 50 light-years away?"
startrek,3dr5wk,exatron,7,Sat Jul 18 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. We should have seen more of the spacers, more of the earth colonies, more first contacts with warp travelling neighbors.   I think the expanse came about as a result of timey wimey bullshit and wasn't always there. I think they wanted to kind of keep the franchise moving forward while also showing off the past... if they wanted to do that, why not show off more of the Enterprise J? Have the captain meet Archer, make a point of him being shown around but simultaneously being limited in his given information, make certain crewmen and from the future and maybe transfer up someone from the past. What I'm getting at is there was plenty of opportunity to go forward and backward and they were pretty much making Voyager 2."
startrek,3dr5wk,BigTaker,5,Sat Jul 18 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it originally the plan to have the first season set before the launch of the Enterprise, on Earth? That would've been interesting, since our own homeworld is incredibly undeveloped in all the series.   I would've wanted to see more of the spacers/Earth Cargo Service too. Though I will say that it's... an odd agency: cargo ships taking years to travel to other systems carrying ambiguous cargo to justify such a duration. Plus, they seemed happy to go beyond the sphere of human exploration when they really shouldn't have been going more than 20 light-years at most (unless there are more stars within that radius than I believe)."
startrek,3dr5wk,sindeloke,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely curious, but what kind of Star Trek type plots can happen in a earth centric setting?"
startrek,3dr5wk,dphizler,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:18 2015 UTC,"You could've had plots dealing with Terra Prime/xenophobia, augments from the Eugenics wars/World War 3 (Colonel Green was originally going to be in the show, I think), a story dealing with the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies, and perhaps a story about Romulan spies on Earth (not that our heroes would discover their true identities/allegiances).  I imagine, all in all, the imminent launch of a vessel capable of going a thousand times beyond Mankind's current reach would set off a whole chain of events and shifts ripe for storytelling."
startrek,3dr5wk,Kolaris8472,3,Sun Jul 19 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"Excellent ideas. I couldn't think of those because I have a tunnel vision towards ""planet of the week"" trek."

startrek,3dr5wk,phtll,2,Sat Jul 18 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"I just can't handle how stupid they all are.  Trip and Archer are under bombardment. Do they stay in their super resilient shuttle and polarize the hull plating, or try to fly away? No. They run off into the desert with no plan or direction, no hats, and two small water bottles.  Reed is stapled to the hull by the leg of a mine that's about to go off. Archer has a choice: cut off Reed's leg and get everyone to safety in plenty of time, jettison the hull and let Reed die by save everyone else, or stand around ranting about how no option he can see is acceptable. He opts to wait on the writers to bail him out with some weird unearned nonsense that doesn't tell us anything meaningful about either of them instead of remembering that even in the 21st century leg prosthetics are pretty good.  Voyager relies on a lot of technobabble and it's a weakness, but at least I never spent a single episode shouting at the screen about what morons they all were and wondering why I should care about their struggles to solve issues which they either brought on themselves with rank idiocy or that aren't even real problems and they're just ignoring the obvious solution (or T'Pol's advice, often the same thing)."
startrek,3dr5wk,johnnyfog,3,Sun Jul 19 10:15:56 2015 UTC,"When I started watching ds9, I didn't skip anything and the show gets better and better each season and I think I wouldn't have appreciated it as much if I had skipped stuff.  I do considering the first 2 seasons much less fun to watch but the atmosphere of the show gets started there and it's hard to tell when exactly the show becomes awesome and that's what I like about the show."
startrek,3dr5wk,NedVole,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:58 2015 UTC,"I really like what they tried to do, but for me they didn't quite pull it off. It fell apart in Sacrifice of Angels.   Reading Behr's thoughts on criticism of that episode, I can understand why they did it. If you watch DS9 as a character driven show (which, to be fair, it is) then that episode is an excellent climax for the character of Sisko.   But perhaps because I grew up with TNG first, I never felt like it was a show about Picard. I felt it was a show about humanity, which was often explored through Picard (and Data).   Humanity is at war with a very alien threat, and DS9 and its characters explore the lengths we'll go to protect our countries and loved ones in times of war. Do the ends really justify the means? There's a lot of fantastic grey areas and line crossing, with character growth in every episode. Then we find out in Sacrifice of Angels it wasn't enough. Wow! Was all that compromising of beliefs for nothing?   But then spoiler, and it all really was for nothing. It didn't matter.   Still a good show, and a healthy departure from the episodic format. But I can't give it top marks because when you build plotlines over multiple seasons, you really need to deliver on the finale."
startrek,3dr5wk,CX316,8,Sun Jul 19 04:42:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no way DS9 is ""widely considered"" to be the best ST series - or TNG for that matter.  The show certainly has an extremely vocal and enthusiastic fan base, but in the scheme of things, it's actually quite small. It's easy to read internet forums and dedicated Star Trek boards and come away with an erroneous understanding of DS9's wider popularity.  In terms of cultural impact, TOS is without doubt the Trek iteration that has, and continues to, penetrate the zeitgeist. TNG, while definitely shining very brightly in the early 90's and undeniably making a big impact is losing quite a lot of ground in the overall ""big picture"" IMHO.  I own the complete DS9 series, but it's easily my least favoured version of the franchise. The war was almost unbearably tedious, dragging on season after season. I hated all the pseudo-religious nonsense and spirit walking with ""the prophets"".  The show often came off as a second rate fantasy series, with the Pah'Wraiths - complete with glowing red eyes, just so you know they really are ""da evals""."
startrek,3dr5wk,LOKAI_of_CHERON,4,Sat Jul 18 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"Do you hate all spiritual stuff when it comes to science fiction or was it just DS9's interpretation that was off to you? For example did you watch Battlestar Galactica? It's pretty much just that, from start to finish. Plus movies. Plus spinoff.   I absolutely loved BSG myself. I'd say BSG is more spiritual than religious. Caprica, however, is all about religion. You understand very quickly that it all begun by terrorism and fanaticism rapidly followed by a full blown religious war fought with Centurions, nothing less!  I liked DS9, one of my favorite trek (not my favorite). It had some issues towards the later seasons, religious extremism and illumination being one, but I can't blame the authors for trying to address the real life subject of Islam-influenced attacks and general hatred towards the USA booming in the 90s. Other things you mention made sense to me. For example the Prophets. Well, shit. Turns out they are real and they have been influencing (directly or not) Bajor for a while!"
startrek,3dr5wk,citizenofgaia,5,Sat Jul 18 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, obviously I understand the prophets are real within the context of the story (I have actually watched the series), but the overriding presentation of the Bajoran's and/or Sisko's interaction with them as we see it on the actual show is always done in a kind of reverential ""spiritual"" manner. Hence my use of the term ""psuedo-religious"".  IMHO, those viewers of a religious inclination would probably find that in some way edifying as they relate it to their own supernatural beliefs. Personally, I find the religious overtones and the portrayal of the ""deeply spiritual"" Bajorans to be tedious and unnecessary, and don't enjoy watching them pray and grovel to their gods and emissary. Again, I understand it within the context of the internal story. Each to their own.  I definitely won't be winning any points from you with this, but I have come to loathe Nu-BSG! Overall, a thoroughly depressing, bleak and negative experience to sit through - just horrible. Full of psychotic, dislikable characters, and ""for the sake of it"", sensationalist, ""dark and gritty"" plot twists. Sorry!!!"
startrek,3dr5wk,eDgEIN708,3,Sat Jul 18 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The way the showrunners presented the Bajoran religion was a joke, they tried to make it too important, too ceremonial, especially in the context of an arc spanning several seasons of a sci-fi show. I can see why they did it, but the result wasn't good. It wasn't spiritual, it was caricatural. For some reason I was able to ignore that and still enjoy most of the show. I've seen all other treks at least twice but DS9 gave me so much mixed feelings over 7 seasons that I don't know if I'd rewatch it again.  Interestingly enough I also kind of agree with your view of BSG. I saw the characters as a backstabbing, violent, unlikable, and unreliable bunch of people who're going on a witch hunt in space. All the soldiers stayed true to the American stereotype: womanizing (even the females), gambling, cheating, some with alcohol abuse and most with severe hero syndrome. As much as it saddens me to say this, and call me cynical, but they all fit in my view of the average human society. I was able to become attached to some of the crew, I loved the BSG mythology as a whole, and the acting was convincing enough to me. But at many times during the show, individual episodes slowed down and they had no plot and progressed very little the main arc, I almost dropped a few times. Don't get me started on the sub-par movies, it was painful."

I just don't think most of the public can remember a single thing Sisko ever said.  I do think J.J.'s movies may have temporarily taken the shine off TOS, though. As much as I enjoyed the first one, I can understand why Trekkers would turn to DS9 for more thoughtful or cohesive storytelling, when the last two Kirk/Spock stories treated the Trek universe in a manner that was so scattershot and crude."

startrek,3dr5wk,desertcoyote77,2,Sat Jul 18 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"Starting from the third season, Ron Moore played a big part in the series and it was great. He also had a hand in the last season of TNG and a little bit of Voyager afterward.  A lot of the projects he works on tend to focus on character development, and it makes for great television that's down-to-earth and very engaging.  If you haven't already, I very highly recommend another project of his, the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. You would be doing yourself a disservice as a sci-fi fan to not at least give it a chance. Watch the miniseries that kicked it off and the first real episode '33' and if you're not hooked then just leave it be, but if you liked the last seasons of DS9 this show is really worth you giving it a shot."
startrek,3dr5wk,brocalmotion,5,Sat Jul 18 23:39:36 2015 UTC,a very little bit of Voyager... didn't he only do like one episode before Braga and Berman screwed him?
startrek,3dr5wk,DoomDash,3,Sun Jul 19 04:35:21 2015 UTC,"Moore and Ira Behr were the bratty children of star trek.  DS9 was developed in large part as an adolescent reaction to Gene's cranky views.  If you look back at Moore's episodes, you can almost smell the disdain:  he has complained in the past that TNG characters weren't allowed to grow or embrace other cultures besides Starfleet.  Ira wanted to take the characters in a darker direction, and quite a few of his scripts were rejected so as not to offend Gene.   Even after Gene died, his in-house directorial style endured; meaning that every planet would look the same, the point n' shoot camerawork would look the same, the music would sound the same, and the characters would act the same.  So Moore was already in the doghouse, i suspect, when he jumped ship to Voyager.  And I doubt it was very hard for Braga to marginalize him.  I don't really know why Berman brought him onboard in the first place; he certainly didn't consult Braga, who wanted no part of Ron.  They got rid of him right away... I don't think Moore even completed his two-parter before they froze him out."

startrek,3dr5wk,bookant,2,Sun Jul 19 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"I liked DS9, but it was probably my least favorite Star Trek series. I haven't watched all of Enterprise yet though."
startrek,3dr5wk,johnnyfog,2,Sun Jul 19 08:09:51 2015 UTC,"I've always believed that Star Trek was about what humanity could be at its best.  TOS and TNG were usually great at showing us the best we had to offer.  DS9 turned that idea around and showed us what we are.  While it offered great stories and characters, it lost that hope for the future that I felt in earlier series."
startrek,3dr5wk,sasquatch007,2,Sun Jul 19 08:44:03 2015 UTC,I often feel that TNG gets a lot of the love it gets from people that haven't really watched much star trek. So much of TNG has been turned into memes and I feel like popular opinion is skewed because of it. Most people who watch DS9 love it. I would recommend Battlestar Galactica if you haven't seen that yet.
startrek,3dr5wk,spilk,2,Sun Jul 19 08:52:55 2015 UTC,"Can't compare a space station environment with one of a flagship of the federation. They had to focus more on characters and character development in DS9, and did a great job with it, sure. PS, Garak, Bashir > Worf, by quite a large margin :)  TNG remains my favorite series, but as I get older, I appreciate DS9 more and more and it's a close second."
startrek,3dr5wk,DammitDan,2,Sun Jul 19 09:43:08 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree.  What makes DS9 interesting is the writing, with longer story arcs and the definitely more serious, darker stories.  That's true.  The writers took off where they left when TNG started becoming good.  However, the characters of DS9 are weaker than the other series (except maybe ENT).  They are less likeable, harder to identify with, in my opinion.  That's probably why the series was not followed as much as were TNG and VOY.   There is no Data, no Seven of Nine, no Doctor in DS9.  As much as I like DS9 as a series, for me a Ferengi is the equivalent of Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars, or Wesley Crusher in TNG.  An annoyance that I can hardly tolerate.  I was able to get used to Odo, the shape-shifter who never shifts his shape, but he's not exactly an appealing character.  Jadzia feels a little blank, too.  Bashir and O'Brien are not strong main characters, yet they are forced to become so.     I still like the show, don't get me wrong.  In fact, it's impressive that they've made episodes of such great quality with characters who are not very appealing a priori."
startrek,3dr5wk,iosonic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"To clarify my thought, the more serious, darker, well-written stories is really what I loved about the show.  I'm not sure that the longer story arcs are necessary per se.  But yeah, apart from the Captain and Garak, the characters are a bit sub-optimal.  I thought Ezri was a good addition to the later seasons, too."
startrek,3dr5wk,picodroid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:14 2015 UTC,Jadzia was the only character that really bored me. I liked Ezri better. Some people don't like the Ferengi and I could see why but personally I love them.   The one thing I really hated were those mirror universe episodes. I just don't care about opposite-land in any of the series.
startrek,3dr5wk,johnnyfog,4,Sun Jul 19 23:19:29 2015 UTC,I don't think DS9 is widely considered the best Trek series. Do you have some data to back that up. Otherwise I'll continue to think that TNG is generally the top ST series if one would measure a wide audience of Trek fans. For older fans I bet TOS beats out TNG.
startrek,3dr5wk,sindeloke,11,Sat Jul 18 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"It's just something I seem to have seen a lot of, perhaps it is only the opinion of a vocal minority.   There is so much Star Trek that I think any series can be anyone's favorite. I guess I'd just have to rewatch seasons 5-7 of TNG to remember why they were so much better than the last 3 seasons of DS9."
startrek,3dr5wk,orgazmo1009,2,Sat Jul 18 19:05:07 2015 UTC,The DS9 group seems to have a louder voice I think than other series fans.  Not that I don't like DS9 - I do but it's a notch below TNG IMHO. I didn't really start liking DS9 until I ran through the series a couple of times in later years.

Fact is, VOY and ENT have equally vocal fans.    What you're overlooking is that the fanbase was split after TNG.  DS9 and VOY were direct competitors in the schedules.  Both sides got funneled into watching ENT, along with the more casual viewers who had never watched Star Trek.  For the most part, ENT was most popular among the casual viewership;  the rest of us were pretty hostile.  Which should have been expected considering how it was marketed as ten different things.  But the point I'm trying to make is the fanbase didn't consciously fracture. It was wedged apart by Paramount who were looking to hedge their bets."

The episodes that I generally like are ones where the story is occuring on the station. I'm not a huge fan of the war scenes and conflict with outside species. Being that is a huge arc during the 7 seasons, there's a large portion of the show I don't actively re-watch."
startrek,3dr5wk,Aliantha,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"I'm reading the criticisms here of DS9 and I cannot really dispute them.  It took far too long for the actors to grow into their roles despite (or perhaps because of) the grueling 25-episode season.  On the other hand, I am inclined to go easy on DS9, because it felt like the shows were constantly trying something --  Even if a lot of it was cribbed from Babylon 5 and Stargate. (VOY is more similar to SG-1 than The Original Series, despite what fans would have us think.)  Above all else the show felt like it was trying something.  I lost track of how many times the show painted itself into a corner and frantically tried to back out of it.  Kira's failed romances, the Jem'Hadar civil war which went nowhere, the Changeling infiltrator plot which went nowhere, the barmy plot with the Pah-Wraith Cult, the goofy homerotic subtext with Garak, fanboys who lionized the show's Space Nazi... the show kept making mistake after mistake, but Paramount was asleep at the wheel and could not (or would not) apply the brakes, and eventually it all coalesced into a beautiful story with the best cast a show could ask for.  As an epitaph for DS9, I'd like to borrow Hitch's epitaph for Gore Vidal: ""Even his blind spots are illuminating."""
startrek,3dr5wk,axilmar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"The homoerotic subtext with Garak and Julian was most certainly not something they tried and failed with. It was something that happened accidentally which they quashed as soon as they noticed. I guess two women who don't end up together after a single episode is more palatable than two men over the course of many who actually might.  That said, I think you're right about the virtue of trying new things. A good half of the complaints I hear about Voyager involve a sense that it took the franchise ""backward"", and retreading old ideas and plots. And I suppose my absolute chief complaint about Enterprise is basically another version of the same."

BBC America airs at least one episode every day so accessibility makes it take the second spot. DS9 should have my number two spot but it's harder for me to get my hands on episodes so character development is worth less. VOY. Good episodes but the holodeck was overused.    TOS doesn't make the list as I would go out of my way to watch it. To me it's just old, way to old to watch.

I can wax about how much I loved DS9 and how it has become my favorite, but if I sit through all of Voyager and it becomes my favorite, will that not cloud my judgement as to what is best? Is the series that popularized Star Trek again for a time and spun off another 7 year series (that itself spun off another 7 year series) the best? Is it the progenitor series and the six movies that followed? Is it the series that unashamedly played around with Star Trek with a mostly free slate?

I found the characters boring and generally unlikable and the setting and story fairly boring as well (Cardassians, Bajorans, and Dominion must be the most bland alien races in Star Trek besides the stuff in Voyager).  I guess it had some more moral ambiguity and ""dark"" storylines than some other Star Trek shows, and it HAD a continuous story (not that it was that interesting), but compared to most other scifi shows that had similar characteristics like Babylon 5, BSG, Farscape, I found DS9 to be quite poor.  Only thing it had going for it was showing fleet-scale Star Trek battles, even if they were kind of poorly executed (ships dying in one-hit all the time).  Anyway.  It's TNG all the way for me, with TOS second followed by Voyager (Which had far more likeabale characters than DS9!)"
startrek,3dtqnm,StealthRabbi,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:10 2015 UTC,DS9 definitely had it's off episodes but it really is a matter of tastes.  I found DS9 explored more issues of humanity than many seem to recognize.  It was more alien.  It wasn't afraid to recognize how we are drawn to the supernatural despite doubting it or not confident we truly understand it at every turn.  It continued the platform for civil rights that TOS did.  It developed minor characters more than any other Trek.  It would have never been produced under Rodenberry because it wasn't afraid to show the Federation wasn't flawless.  It was more honest.  I am not sure I have the desire to reward it as much as TNG but it was a journey I loved taking after rediscovering it on Netflix.

Actually, speaking anecdotally, I've seen many but-hurt TNG fans use this lofty, retconned idea of ""core values"" in Trek to berate anything that doesn't measure up to their personal understanding/opinion of the franchise.  If there's no ready room debate about ethics and morality with a fluffy counselor it's a terrible betrayal of Trek's towering ""values"". Gimmie a break.

Just stating it's written in a way anyone could play it doesn't make it so.

Or Kirk and two catgirls undressed in bed together? Or the Benedict Cumberbatch shower scene that was cut from the movie?  Of course Alice Eve's scene fan is gratuitous fanservice, but these movies are loaded with that, so why is the shortest and least offensive scene the only one people complain about?"

All of these scenes will get an automatic pass from most of the hardcore TNG/DS9 fans as being ""integral"" to the story or some such.

Spock's death in Star Trek 2 was probably a much shorter scene than the Seti Alpha IV stuff but it's still the most impactful scene in the film.  I say that without checking but you get the point. You can't measure a scene's importance or weight by its length. That'd be completely misunderstanding film.  In this case, it says a lot that, even if it is just 5 seconds, it's the one scene people remember when you mention the character. Not because it's a big deal or anything - just because her character was so flat and her other scenes (no matter the length) had no major effect on us."

He got sick of this, so in this case he decided trying to flex his jaw to open the air passageways that might preclude this (like people do in airplanes) - it didn't work, which is why he never did it again.

Certainly possible but you'd think the whole ship would have the same pressure. I wonder how that works with different gravity plating for every deck. If the plating goes out on a deck does all the air settle to the next deck down? Then again you would think each deck would hold it's own pressure in case of hull breaches.

startrek,3doikw,centralcontrol,5,Sat Jul 18 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"If it were a starship worth its salt, there would be all sorts of separate pressurized areas on the ship, and the pressure would certainly vary from time to time."

""All Good Things"" for really the same reason (lighter on action though). Even Ron Moore and Brannon Braga said that in hindsight they thought they should have made Generations the series finale and All Good Things the movie. For a third I would say ""The Wounded"". The heroes go after a half-crazed captain hell bent on starting a war for all the wrong reasons. Expand the action bits and that would be a good movie. Will think a bit on the other series and make another post :)"

And First Contact (assuming the first TNG film would still be a passing-the-torch story) came out during DS9 third season.

It's the one where they investigate a planet with a small colony where there is some radiation that should have killed everyone but they are alive and fine. Turns out there are no animals anywhere because of the radiation and the people are alive because they've all been infected with these plant spores that makes them kinda like hippy zombies but also protects them from radiation. There is a great scene where Kirk is the last person left on the Enterprise and is about to abandon ship to join the rest of the mutiny crew on the surface and you think it's the end of the line.

Didn't you say that you'd have liked it if their uniforms would be tattered the longer the show goes? My answer was that Starfleet likes it's bling and thus keeping uniforms in order is a high priority. Simple concept. It's important to them so they expend the energy (which can't be that much anyways, as stated).   ""They have this thing called replicators.""

Yes, costumes and props are a real world issue, Voyager had real world issues with the show runners literally running it into the ground.

startrek,3dqjbf,exitpursuedbybear,2,Sat Jul 18 21:58:17 2015 UTC,Yet they had assigned holodeck times. The well-being of the crew is highest priority.  Do you not acknowledge that Starfleet as a quasi-military organization is big on order and a well-kept appearance?  The energy to keep uniforms nice is minimal. If it wasn't there I bet you Janeway would give up her holodeck time to have them kept in order. She loves that shit. Proper Starfleet conduct.   Your comment came off pretty rude.

Kirk ad Spock and Nazis, oh my!                The Paradise Syndrome. A chance to see Kirk embrace his humanity, relish the simple life, essentially be a dude rather than a captain. Plus they could show just how useless the Enterprise is without Kirk and why Vulcans really shouldn't be in command.  TNG: Time's Arrow. As others have said, it's brilliant.         Parallels. Worf's adventures through the multiverse. Expand it both by having more at the beginning, and take him further away, maybe to one where the Khitomer massacre never occurred, and he is on a Klingon ship about to destroy the Enterprise. I'm just a sucker for travels through the multiverse.           Journey's End. Both the inclusion of First Nations people still dealing with displacement some 350 years in the future, combined with some Maquis influence, plus Wesley wandering off to become some extra-dimensional being all add up to a good movie premise.  DS9: Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang. Ocean's 11 in space.        The Siege of AR-558. Military tactics meet moral quandaries. Plus Nog loses a leg.        Take Me Out to the Holosuite: I like baseball and I like Star Trek. 'Nuff said.  VOY: Year of Hell. Most mentioned one on here, and worth it.         In the Flesh. A taste of home for the Voyager crew and alien intrigue. Plus Boothby.         Pilot. The pilot was an interesting premise and offered a lot of hope.

startrek,3dqjbf,neg8ivezero,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"I think the Andorian-related stories from Enterprise could make a fun movie.  Begin with mistrust (The Andorian Incident 1x07) and work through some issues (maybe not Xindi, though) to become more friendly.  Don't let them get too friendly, maybe throw a complication into the relationship near the end, and you've got yourself a sequel there, buddy!  Maybe this is a touchy subject because of the rumors of a Worf project, but... I think the TNG story arc revolving around Worf's discommendation and the search for the next Klingon emperor would do well as a movie (Sins of the Father, 3x17; Redemption I and II, 4x26 and 5x01).  Again, write the emperor character to give him ambiguous or antagonistic feelings towards the Federation and you've got another sequel!  To pick one from DS9 I'd go with the Maquis (2x20, 2x21).  I think, with a lot of partisan rhetoric in politics today, the idea of the United Federation of Planets having to deal with a group that wants to break way could be either really interesting or (if poorly written, or if I wrote it) end up really ham-fisted and preachy.

From Deep Space nine, I would have to say trials and tribble-lations because it's a great episode. And I like to see Sisko be in that era.  And from the next generation, I forgot the name of the episode but it was the one where there were Romulans on board the enterprise and it looked like they were being boarded, Geordie and someone else were trying to figure out what was going on as it look like time has stopped. In reality the Romulans needed help and working together with the crew of the enterprise to take care of the problem with their ship before it was too late.

Unlike the other Trek series, in DS9 the story constantly built on what came before. Part of the reason to set the show on a remote outpost was to constrast with a show where the starship could just leave at the end of an episode and go on to the next thing without continuing consequences, and having the cast stuck in one place with its own rich history and ongoing political issues helped with that. That contrast with TNG was the original goal, and having the remote outpost become central to Alpha Quadrant politics helped, not hindered, its success."

VOY and ENT were developed on the principle that what worked before will work again.  Keep the bland music.  Hire more 'economical' actors. Don't even bother with convincing sets or makeup. Dial up the fanservice.  Recycle scripts shamelessly.  Never, ever reference past episodes."
startrek,3ds2ao,johnnyfog,2,Sun Jul 19 06:03:45 2015 UTC,I dont think so...I loved the dominion war story arc. I really enjoyed seeing more of the federations political side. The whole section 31 stuff was great as well. Easily my favorite trek series.
startrek,3ds2ao,88reaper,2,Sat Jul 18 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the few, I think, who really liked the small-scale political and insular stories in the first couple seasons. I liked focusing on things that were vitally important to Cardassia/Bajor, and not so important beyond this sector. I also liked the random stories coming from people stopping by the station. It was a good set up.  I also loved how they handled the buildup of hostilities with the Dominion - still being a largely standalone episode show, with a few larger story eps sprinkled throughout. Even season 6, which started with a little arc of the station being occupied really worked for me. Even at this point, I think the show was still being true to its original goals. Lots of character-focused episodes.  I thought season 7 kind of dropped the ball a bit. The prophets became of constant importance, Dukat went from compelling villain to mustache-twiddling supervillain. It felt like the show lost the appeal that made it so wonderful in favor of the heavy galaxy-in-the-balance story stuff. There were still some strong episodes, but I think they went epic rather than deep. I think you're right that it may have lost itself a little."
startrek,3ds2ao,readwrite_blue,3,Sun Jul 19 21:41:45 2015 UTC,"You've asked three entirely different questions here.   Did DS9 succeed in its original goals?   Yes and no. It succeeded at some goals but not at others.  The original set-up was intended to focus on Bajor and its religion and Ben Sisko's role as the Emissary and the aftermath of the Cardassian occupation and relations with Cardassia. It started out in that direction, but then got sidetracked by what they found on the other side of the wormhole. The writers invented a ""Dominion"" during the second season, then started fleshing it out during the third season, and eventually allowed this storyline to dominate the series at the expense of the original goals. Look at the closing arc: most of the attention was given to resolving the Dominion War, with the Emissary and the Kai and the Prophets taking second place to the war.   It did have another goal: to show conflict in Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry was adamant that 24th century humans would not be petty and bicker with each other. DS9 was set up with conflict built in to the premise: Bajor versus the Federation, Bajor versus Cardassia, the Federation versus Cardassia, Kira versus Sisko, everyone versus Bashir, Garak versus anyone, and so on. It definitely succeeded in delivering on this conflict. Amazingly and spectacularly. These political and personal conflicts drove the series and the characters and led to some excellent story-telling.    Were such grand events necessary for DS9?   I think some form of grand events were inevitable for DS9. They were kind of built in to the premise: there had to be some pay-off to Sisko's assignment to bring Bajor into the Federation, to the post-occupation relationship between Bajor and Cardassia, to the plot point that Ben Sisko was the Prophets' Emissary. And, the people on Deep Space Nine weren't going anywhere. They couldn't fix a problem on a random planet and then fly off to the next adventure. Because they were stuck in the one place, their actions would have consequences, and those consequences would trigger more actions, and more consequences. Yes, it was necessary to have these elements build up and pay off in some grand way. The Dominion War wasn't necessary, but some form of grand events was necessary.    Would the series have been better if it had embraced continuity earlier and kept its close and personal focus?   No. I think it would have just become a soap opera in space if its only focus had been on the interpersonal relationships. It needed some larger issues to deal with - whether that was Bajor and the Prophets and Cardassia, or the Dominion War. Something big had to be going on in this series."

startrek,3dsihv,Diactylmorphinefiend,2,Sun Jul 19 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"I grew up with TNG, and I want to get into DS9 eventually. I had serious reservations about Voyager, so I started watching it before finishing all of TNG, in case I had a really bad taste in my mouth after completing VOY. I had reservations because of all the Voyager hate I heard through the years, and I was really cynical through the first 3 episodes; I was very close to giving up at the coffee in this nebula thing, but I kept watching it. There is a lot of gold moments in the show. Tom Paris? At first I wondered why they had this douche on the bridge, but you know what? I came to admire him because he realize the break he was given by Janeway. B'Ellana? Oh, cool, they had to get that 90s edginess into Star Trek somehow right? Except she grows up from being impulsive and brash to living more towards her full potential as a brilliant engineer (I'm a guy and I can only imagine how the potential of her character inspiring girls wanting to go into STEM careers). There are a lot of inspiring characters in the show and I am hooked. Lots of colorful, TOS like moments, some instances where I can tell the actors must be having fun (evil Janeway and Tuvok in a twisted museum hologram anyone?). After giving this show a chance, I say its entertaining, and I am not convinced that the actors mailed it in or were all that bad as much as I think Paramount wanted to do post TNG Star Trek at the lowest price possible. What is played out and cliche are the people who complain about how the show should be about Starfleet v. Maquis, but that's my opinion. Not popular around here, just as much as op's thoughts, as indicated by the upvote ratio to this post, but whatevs. Let the echo-chamber continue."

It means the world to me. It makes me feel hopeful, or at the very least okay. Enjoy all thay the franchise has to offer, it makes me very happy to hear that someone is diving in to ST for the first time."
startrek,3dpg2l,nonlocalflow,2,Sat Jul 18 12:48:52 2015 UTC,"Well, keep watching Spock in the original series, and ignore what you perceive to be the sexism in it because the simple fact of the matter is that it was a different time. The original series was very radical and almost subversive in how it approached things though because it was about breaking down barriers and changing things --changing the world, and trying to make it a better place wherein we were all accepting of each other regardless of sex or color or nationality. It was about our working together as a human family, and moving beyond our personal biases and prejudices. Spock is very much a loner in the original series, yet in some ways he was also the most human character of all. He was by definition introverted, feeling he had to bury deep things that his Vulcan heritage would frown upon or consider shameful. He was a stranger in a strange land sort of, apart from his own race and living amongst a crew made up mostly of humans who tended not to hide their feelings and emotions, and these were the people he chose to make his friends, colleagues, and family ultimately. Wait until you reach ""Journey to Babel"" --what I'm talking about is very much on display there in various respects.  I think one of the reasons the original series managed to strike a cord with so many people though is that it also spoke to loners on some level even if that wasn't truly one of the intents of the series. There's so much there about friendship and love and what it means to be human, and we see it early on in the show. Pike struggles with the responsibilities of being Captain and how it weighs on him; Kirk struggles with the idea of having to strand, or worse yet, kill his best friend. Then we meet young Charlie, who as an adolescent not raised in the company of human beings, doesn't know how to act around people, or how to properly express interest in a girl --a true loner in that episode if ever there was one.  And don't take this the wrong way, but you should consider seeing a Social Worker to help you work through some of the PTSD stuff if you aren't already.   At any rate, a line from the ship's doctor in ""The Cage"" stands out in my mind here, which I feel I should include in closing, for whatever it's worth to you:     ""A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away"".    I'm glad you're enjoying the original series, regardless of how or what brought you into it."

You'll find a lot in Star Trek to be inspiring in that regard, and Spock's journey is very powerfu. From TOS season 1 through the movies (and ""Unification"" in TNG), he at first tried to make it as a Vulcan and then, after failing, found his own path and stuck to his guns no matter what anyone else told him."
startrek,3dpg2l,post-baroque,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you found something meaningful in Trek, I did too.   I relate to Spock as well, but I think for very different reasons. I am autistic and Spock represents, to me, what I hope to be one day. A man who can eloquently explain why he acts the way he does, and do so in such a way that it garners respect.   I have trouble communicating vocally, not that most people notice, but my thoughts are very difficult to express with spoken word, or at least they are to me. I end up abbreviating and summarizing my thoughts into simple, concise, phrases that often times don't get taken as literally as they should and don't fully convey what I really think. I want to be able to express my thoughts with the apparent ease of Mr. Spock.   To add to this, people don't find it strange when Spock speaks on emotional topics with a level head, they respect it because he is 1/2 Vulcan. I hope to one day get that kind of respect.  On a lighter note, I would love to hear your opinion on the JJ Spock vs the TOS Spock. As someone who saw the new movies before watching TOS, you have the opposite perspective from me and the same fascination with Spock. It would be... fascinating, to hear your perspective."
startrek,3dpg2l,neg8ivezero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm still getting to know TOS Spock; but one major thing that comes to mind is that JJ Spock's voice is perfect to play Spock. Zachary Quinto has the ability to make his voice sound like almost exactly like a highly sophisticated text-to-speak robot, yet he also finds the perfect balance between that and expression. I think good examples (or at least memorable) of this perfect dash of emotion are the lines ""I am expressing multiple attitudes simultaneously. To which are you referring?"" and when he tells the Vulcan Council President ""The only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper."" These were among the most emotional lines for Spock in the films. In my own opinion in both of these instances Quinto hits the sweet spot for emotional tone. Any more would have been over the top for Spock's character.  I think sometimes TOS Spock, while still holding a neutral tone, sometimes has moments where I think ""Oh, I guess the original Spock showed more emotion in his tone than I expected him to.""  Listening to JJ Spock's nearly robotic voice amazes me."

Dialogue, in and of itself, can be exciting if you value plot and drama alongside sfx and action.  Watching two characters debate the future of Vulcans involvement in the Federation is absolutely both plot and drama, it reveals elements of the story as well as the positions of these two characters, the Vulcan Council, the motivations of the Klingons, and sets us up for their attempt to alter the position of the Council, which, considering they're Vulcans, will be no small task.

That is not how this project started out and how it was supposed to be produced, and I think the CGI in this scene is overdone and all too obvious. The prosthetic ears on the actress were also very apparent as she walked in that scene thanks to the lighting, which is not something the filming process should be drawing any attention to obviously, so I found it very distracting and annoying.

startrek,3dlcug,ierc,4,Fri Jul 17 15:07:05 2015 UTC,Kind of reminds me of the cutscenes in a lot of the early video games that used cinematics with live actors like Wing Commander 3 and 4.   Right now it looks like it lacks detail and proper blending with the lighting.  If that's the final rendition they'd be better filming out in the desert with wooden huts instead of trying to cg the backgrounds.
startrek,3dlcug,SailorDeath,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the later Wing Commander games was what I thought of more than Star Wars. Although in my case it's because those are pretty much universally beloved games and I'm being optimistic here, CGI backgrounds doesn't have to mean bad writing.  Edit: And actually, I was thinking more of modern made for TV Sci-Fi and Fantasy, like The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, or Defiance, while actually watching, the video games thing was in response to the discussion. It's pretty much TV grade CGI, which is impressive, considering it's a fan film on a tight budget."
startrek,3dlcug,Owyn_Merrilin,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:17 2015 UTC,I think part of the issue is just the lighting.  it doesn't look right and natural and the actors are not blended with the scene well as the lighting on them clashes with the lighting on the scenery.

It looks like it's going to experiment with new styles while at the same time exploring the political and philosophical dimension that the Hollywood films haven't. Isn't that exactly what we want? Something that grows the universe without sacrificing the meat of it?   The people who complain about the JJ movies but can't then get behind a movie that doesn't have the bells and whistles that a multi-million dollar budget brings are blind. One reason they ended up as popcorny action flicks was to justify and recoup the huge budget with the promise of larger crowds. Working with a smaller, crowd-funded budget means more freedom for this team to follow the slower and more methodical approach of the television shows, and judging by this scene, it seems it's exactly what they're doing.

That is not what Star Trek is about and nor has it ever been. This is a disgraceful display. Axanar is probably the most ambitious fan project besides Star Trek Continues out there today and it is a powerful tool to show the networks that we not only want more Star Trek but they need to put more Star Trek back on TV. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.
startrek,3dlcug,SteamDelta,10,Fri Jul 17 17:12:00 2015 UTC,Sorry mom.
startrek,3dlcug,Citizen001,4,Fri Jul 17 17:25:44 2015 UTC,Shit I do sound like my mom sometimes. Ugh.
startrek,3dlcug,SteamDelta,4,Fri Jul 17 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"But to the original point, the CGI is being criticized because it's clearly the point of the scene. The 3 minute clip seems like a CGI high light reel. They tried an awesome space scene, alien planet, landscape and architecture, and didn't quite pull it off. It's like the uncanny valley. It detracts more than it adds. It's like watching a high school football team try trick plays rather practicing fundamentals."
startrek,3dlcug,MeloniousThonk,6,Fri Jul 17 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"I thought the point of the scene was to establish that we are on Vulcan, that the Vulcans are preparing to leave the Federation, and that at least one major political figure on Vulcan is pushing against the current with the help of Humans, setting the stage for a conflict that will drive the story. The rest is window dressing. Why is the fact that the window dressing isn't up to Hollywood standards so important? Is that what you're watching for? Would you prefer it to be filmed in a Vulcan office building?"
startrek,3dlcug,SteamDelta,6,Fri Jul 17 18:06:25 2015 UTC,The original doesn't have CGI but it had styrofoam rocks and I have definitely heard it bashed because of that.
startrek,3dlcug,Citizen001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:51 2015 UTC,That's kinda a weak argument isn't it. Look at Star Trek Continues. While they have spectacular sets they still depend on 1960s era special effects does this detract from how great it is because it's not modern and safisticated like Axanar or ST09. No because the story has been and always will be more important.
startrek,3dlcug,SteamDelta,4,Fri Jul 17 18:26:34 2015 UTC,Ok once they have a story that is impressive let me know.
startrek,3dlcug,MeloniousThonk,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:55 2015 UTC,Haha fair enough. We'll see when it's released. I just hate to see people dismiss it just because of the special effects.
startrek,3dlcug,Citizen001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:09 2015 UTC,Well for me I am already sold on the story but I am a gigantic fanboy so I might have my biases. I was a huge fan of the Vulcan story line in Enterprise and in my opinion saved that show for me and to see the Vulcans once again in that same position only now with the rest of the Federation is fascinating to me. Be that as it may I am willing to concede that fact that one good scene does not a good movie make and only time will tell.
startrek,3dlcug,SteamDelta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:01 2015 UTC,It distracted me from the scene. Could be a personal issue of mine. I'll say that the part in space was awesome. But then I'm easily distracted. For example in the second viewing I was left with the question of why do the atmospheric small crafts look like the big space ring ships but just scaled down? But there is almost a precedent in that because trek shuttles always have nacelles that match their mother ships and they fly with out wings
startrek,3dlcug,UNSCInfinity,2,Fri Jul 17 18:14:30 2015 UTC,Aren't the rings just what the Vulcans use instead of nacelles? I was under the impression that the small craft was a warp capable shuttle.
startrek,3dlcug,DiaperParty,4,Fri Jul 17 18:59:52 2015 UTC,People aren't critical of this because it lacks bells and whistles. Seems to be the opposite.
startrek,3dlcug,pg104,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:21:17 2015 UTC,I have noticed more negativity in this sub and amongst ST fans than any other sci-fi fan group. Every new concept or production (professional or fan) is bitched about and torn apart. Nothing is ever good enough. I'd rather have SOMETHING to watch even if it's not perfect...but these assholes seem to think it either has to be exactly as THEY want it or it shouldn't exist at all. It's terribly annoying. Axanar has gotten a stupid amount of hate and the behavior of some people bashing it has been really mental.
startrek,3dlcug,rejectionist,0,Sat Jul 18 14:40:48 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I thought it was great.
startrek,3dlcug,rebo2,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would have helped to put that it's a fan production in the tittle because most including me come here, have no idea what Axion is and assume it's the new movie trailer."
startrek,3dlcug,ParrotofDoom,13,Fri Jul 17 22:40:25 2015 UTC,"Too many angles, so much going on.  Too much to take in.  Compare that conversation to this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Yy6x2Jky8  Simple, short, concise - everything Vulcans are supposed to be.  And it carries over to the choice of camera angle.  No fancy tracking shots, just simple static imagery that allows the actors to take centre stage, not the effects."
startrek,3dlcug,NEM3S1S,3,Fri Jul 17 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"I love that. It's almost theatrical, in the traditional live performance sense. You know precisely what to focus on, and it just works."
startrek,3dlcug,Phreakhead,3,Fri Jul 17 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Really, the reason why those edits are awkward, is because they break the eyeline of the 180° rule. If they just removed the frontal shots it would sit a lot better with the audience."
startrek,3dlcug,Burge97,2,Fri Jul 17 21:44:42 2015 UTC,"It seems like everyone ""defending"" Axanar are mostly just trying to say that it's OK that there's not great special effects.     I agree, it would be if they didn't do 30 seconds of horrible planetary approach shots.  Do 5 seconds of a far off flyby tilting down towards the planet, then get with the conversation.  And what's that ol'e saying about brevity??!"
startrek,3dlcug,Corgana,4,Fri Jul 17 20:49:09 2015 UTC,That movie had a budget of around $50 Million in today's dollars. Axanar has less than $1 Million. I doubt they could afford a professional cinematographer like you and have much money for anything else.
startrek,3dlcug,ParrotofDoom,6,Fri Jul 17 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"You don't need a professional cinematographer to achieve the same effect - you just need to understand that edit-edit-edit-edit-edit distracts the viewer from what's going on.  Whoever edited it obviously wants to show the viewer how great their special effects are, not realising of course that good episodes of Star Trek are about human stories, not special effects."

startrek,3dlcug,Nachteule,14,Fri Jul 17 14:59:43 2015 UTC,What is the circlejerk about humans - that we are so great - doesn't sound realistic to me. Even in the fiction the human race joined the party of Warp capable races very late and still has terrorist (Marquis) in the 24th century. So we as a race are not so evolved and mature at all. Why the high praise? Do the writers really need to make us feel good about future self?
startrek,3dlcug,Tuskin38,29,Fri Jul 17 11:58:07 2015 UTC,Humanity has always been a founding member of the federation.  Hell the capital is on earth.  They're taking this from the fiction.  Star Trek has always been about making our future selves seem great. Until DS9 came along.
startrek,3dlcug,Nachteule,-9,Fri Jul 17 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"They founded the federation because they where weak and not able to survive against the Romulans and Klingons all by themself. Without the help of other species, mankind would have been destroyed/conquered several times. How is that a sign of greatness if you depend on others? The federation became a force on its own, but it started pretty weak and was the results of the scary things mankind encountered after using their first warp drive.   And there had been the Terra Prime movement and the humans also have the Section 31 that do not follow the goals of the federation but are very selfish and egoistic and give a damn about other races and  their future."

Humanity negotiated the peace/prevented war between the Andorians and Vulcan.  Archer exposed the High Command's lies. He found the Ki'shara  They stopped the Romulans mostly by them selves."

That humans were not as technologically great as others, yet their actions and ability to build coalitions is what made such a strong union."
startrek,3dlcug,Nachteule,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"Roddenberrys vision is one thing, what the TV and movies showed another. The tv series showed several times that the oh so great next generation humans where not so selfless and nice once they felt fear. Starting with the Terra Prime movement that was based on the fear of alien attacks up to the massive critics Picard had to face because they found the Borg and lead them to earth. It continued when Janeway decided to force the Federation moral on other species. Humans are only friendly and cooperative if you do things the way humans want them to be done.  This little speech Quark gives summs up what humans really are"

startrek,3dlcug,StarTrekMike,7,Fri Jul 17 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"My feelings about fan productions are usually pretty negative. There are some that have one or two outstanding aspects like Star trek Phase II with it's uniforms, set design, and general lighting and camera work but at the same time, Phase II also has issues with awful acting, poor writing and extremely poor directing.  Others have no redeeming qualities, the Hidden Frontier series is completely unwatchable with it's awful acting, writing, poorly done CG ""sets"", and pretty much everything else. I know it sounds harsh but I can't help but judge them alongside canon Star trek films and TV series.  By far the most saddening is projects like Of gods and men and Renegades. The idea of Trek alumni actively producing new Trek content seems really great on paper but the execution of them left so much to be desired. I could not really understand how things like costumes, general writing, and (most importantly) directing were done so poorly.  Renegades is by far the worst offender. It feels like a bad fan-fiction story that one might see linked on a tumblr account. It just completely misses the point of Star trek.  This project however seems like it is taking a more ""purist"" approach. It looks like they are trying to capture the feel of the shows on some level and for that, I have to give them so praise. It looks like the actors in this scene are actually being directed by someone who can actually direct actors, this is more than I can say for any other fan production and it will probably end up making the biggest difference.  So I think it will be perfect or amazing? No, not really. I do think it has a shot at actually being watchable however and it seems that the production staff has set tight rules in order to keep it more in line with the existing franchise (as opposed to turning into a terrible fan-fiction style playground)."

If the Death Star sent out Tie Fighters first, The Borg would destroy them giving them time to beam over the Death Star and infiltrate the computer system. Technologically The Borg are more advanced and I doubt it would take much time to figure out the frequency of the energy weapons the Death Star uses.

startrek,3dmj9a,gowronatemybaby7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"the borgs main advantage is that they can adapt to their enemies weapons after only a couple of shots.  Of course, with the death star, you only need one shot.  That's provided it hits of course, the borg would be able to quickly adapt to everything other than the superlaser, so all other defenses are more or less negligible. IIRC Death star I needed 24 hours between shots but Death star II only needed 60 seconds.  In a likely first encounter scenario, the borg would slowly approach the death star, scan it and offer the crew the chance to be assimilated. The imperial crew would say ""fuck that"" send out a few warning shots, maybe dispatch fighters and order a star destroyer to intercept if there's one about (which is more than likely)  The borg will continue their approach, the death star will cease with the warning shots and fire directly at them with turbolasers. Fighters will definitely be dispatched by now and any available capital ships will be on their way.  Having taken only minor damage from the initial volleys, the borg are now in close proximity to the death star and are cutting chunks out of it for analysis. Any imperial fighters that approach are rapidly destroyed or possibly taken on board the cube for assimilation.  The star destroyer has at the cube with all turbolasers and ion cannons. The ion cannons will be disruptive enough that the cube pauses in its analysis of the death star.  Now here's where it gets a bit variable.   The borg usually like to beam onto their opponents ships as soon as possible and the empire certainly don't seem to have the kind of shields that can stop a transporter beam. In their early encounters with the federation, they seemed a bit more stand-offish, possibly because they didn't perceive them as a threat. If the borg beam on to the death star, it's unlikely the empire will ever be able to get them out, they managed to hide themselves on the enterprise which was thousands of times smaller. If the borg get aboard, either someone sets off the self destruct or it's now called the Borg Star. But as this is their first encounter, I think it's reasonable to assume the borg don't beam on board immediately.  Now, ordinarily the borg will be right up in your face, too close for the imperials to bring the superlaser to bear unless they happen to fly right over it.   So once the Star destroyer lays into the borg with their ion cannons , it will pause, what happens next depends on wether or not the empire are smart enough. If they lure the cube a bit further away from the death stars surface and if they manouvere the death star so they can bring the superlaser to bear, then BAM! the borg are toast (assuming of course, that they haven't already beamed on board).  If this is a true first encounter, then I'd favour the empire, but if the borg had any prior knowledge of the Death star, then they'd just approach the side that doesn't have a massive laser weapon and asssimilate the hell out of it."

startrek,3dmj9a,r3v,12,Fri Jul 17 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"Wrong, and provably so.  The (soft canon) Eclipse, the Emperors personal Super-Star Destroyer, had a mega-laser capable of cracking a planets surface. It was several kilometers long and required several hours to recharge it's main weapon.  The (hard canon) Enterprise-D once had to drill through a planets crust to relieve tectonic pressures to avoid a catastrophe, and they had reduce Phaser power to avoid doing it too quickly and shattering the tectonic plate. The Enterprise can maintain sustained Phaser fire for hours.  The (soft canon) Sun Crusher, developed at the Maw Installation has a number of specialized torpedoes capable of making a star go supernova, it is unique and took dozens of the Empire's top scientists decades to build. It cannot be repeated.  The (hard canon) Dr. Tolian Soran in Star Trek, on his own, over just a decade or so, created a Trilithium Torpedo that could end all fusion within a star and trigger a massive shockwave, destroying the entire solar system. This isn't unique, and the technology can be repeated so long as one has a source of Trilithium (which isn't said to be particularly rare).  The advantages Star Wars has are in travel times, Hyperspace shortcuts relativity and the fact that the entire galaxy is smaller (due to the universes expansion having not gone on for as long ""a long long time ago"") means that .5 past lightspeed is sufficient for Interstellar travel.  In Trek distances are incredibly more vast, and Warp travel, even going tens of thousands of times the speed of light, travel times are longer."

The Enterprise is explicitly stated to have the firepower to destroy the entire surface of a planet in just under an hour. In DS9, we see a a fleet of 25 ships fire a single volley at a planet and reduce an entire hemisphere down through the crust and into the mantle. The Base Delta Zero that star wars fans are so enamored with is NOT CANON.  There is no canon ability for star wars ships to do so, and the only thing we ever see in a canon source that comes anywhere close to answering the question for that kind of firepower is Han's offhand remark that destroying an entire planet would take at least half the entire Imperial Navy.  In actual terms of on screen fire firepower, we have seen both Trek and Wars capital ships vaporize asteroids up to about 200 meters, but nothing beyond that. When the Falcon hides inside a giant kilometers-wide asteroid, the Imperial fleet doesn't just disintegrate it, they send in bombers to coat the surface with charges. If an ISD had the kind of firepower that the Stardestroyer.net people postulate, they wouldn't have needed to, they could have just blasted the asteroid to smithereens.

Also, I think we can strike Han's comment from being anywhere near useful- it's an off hand exaggeration. He might as well have said ""a lot!""  Finally, in ESB they didn't know which asteroid the falcon was hiding in, they were bombing random large asteroids to try and force the Falcon out of it's hiding place (on whichever asteroid that happened to be).

Not even delving into behind the scenes tech manuals though, the technology of star wars is definitely far more advanced than that of star trek.  At the time of TNG, the federation has had faster than light travel for less than 300 years. Humans in star wars have had it for at least thousands. It would take the enterprise 150+ years to get from one end of the milky way to the other. It would take the millennium falcon a day or two.  Most importantly, the empire has the ability to not only kill everything on a planet, but crack the crust and completely vaporize all matter on the planet in a matter of seconds. It takes even the most powerful alpha quadrant fleets hours to just kill everything on a planet.  Just from all of those hints alone, the falcon and probably all star wars ships are far more advanced than anything the federation have, despite looking like hunks of junk."
startrek,3dmj9a,Rentun,3,Fri Jul 17 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"Other comments above have already defended the STU for most of these points, but just to recap quick  Speed: SW probably takes this, there's talk of star wars ships traveling across the galaxy in a day or two, but u see other comments about their galaxy being smaller. I'll admit, while loving ST far more than SW, the smaller universe theory is dumb. SW takes speed  Tech: I think ST takes this. There's comments above about building a weapon to destroy a star, while SW had their best scientists working for decades to accomplish this task, Dr Soren in ST accomplished the same in a decade. There's also this cool thing called a transporter, so I think that's pretty advanced. Shields and ablative armor are also big deals in ST, whereas SW, as far as I can remember, had no shields and only basic ship armor.(could be wrong)  Weapons: I far and away think ST takes this, not even close. The argument about lasers in SW being the same as Phasers in Trek I do not agree with. We see Phased weapons doing crazy things while the lasers in SW are basically a beam of light that may hurt if it hits you. There's comments above regarding 25 federation ships being on par with the Death Star, and then we can add in photon torpedos.  Overall: I see the enterprise winning. It's a much more fair fight if we said ""United Federation of Planets VS Imperial Galactic Empire"" however, the fight of the Enterprise vs the Falcon, I'll put anything on the enterprise"
startrek,3dmj9a,Dragonslayer180,3,Fri Jul 17 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"Good post overall, but a couple of technical details are off.   Nearly all Star Wars ships all have shields of two types (ray shields which protect against energy weapons, and particle shields which protect against physical projectiles). There are some small fighters that only have weak particle shields which work like navigational deflectors in Trek, but they are not particularly relevant here.   The big difference in SW vs ST shields is that SW capital ships don't seem to have the big protective bubble that Trek ships all have. instead, it seems that the shields are projected much closer to the hull. Remember the infamous unshielded thermal exhaust port? If they were using Trek style ""bubble"" shields then those X-Wings would have had to blast through them before they could do anything to the Death Star. As for armor, It gets brought up pretty often for starfighters and I don't see any reason to assume they wouldn't use a lot more of it on the bigger ships. I don't think there is any reasonable way to compare how ""basic"" either one is relative to the other.   As for weapons, Trek Phasers are (to quote memory alpha) ""particle weapons and fire nadion particle beams."" Star Wars lasers, meanwhile, fire bolts of superheated tibanna gas (the stuff they mine at Cloud City). These are very different from the actual lasers that Riker says they were invulnerable to. Probably the closest Star Trek analogue would be plasma weapons (not a point in their favor) but it's entirely possible that using Tibanna gas allows a far higher energy output than any Star Trek plasma weapon. They are clearly less versatile and powerful in handheld form, but that doesn't tell us much about the shipboard models that don't have to worry about conserving the charge of a power pack and gas canister.   None the less, I don't see any reasonable justification for a souped up 35x26 meter freighter with a couple military grade quad laser turrets taking on a starship between six and twenty times it's size. This is an incredibly easy win for any of the Federation Enterprise's, although the NX-01 might have had a real fight on it's hands."

A big bulky ship has to make maneuvers by coordinates and requires a lot of power to quickly move such a large mass. The Falcon is small and piloted via stick by a wiley smuggler. Possible force use, depending on the occupants. If Luke is aboard, he could hurl nearby objects at the Enterprise or possibly even keep the entire ship from moving. Risky, unexpected, and often times, amazing strategy from Han that would be hard to counter for anyone outside of, maybe, Kirk.   The Enterprise Beats the Falcon in these Areas:   Defensive power. Keep in mind that the weapons and shields in both ships are energy based. You can't really slice it any other way here. A ship that size, capable of sustaining Warp 9+, is going to have a ton more power in it than the Falcon. It is likely that the Falcon wouldn't even be able to touch the actual hull of the enterprise as the shields are so powerful. Offensive Power. Using the same logic, the Enterprise has a lot more power to put into it's weapons too.  The Enterprise doesn't have to win, just disable the Falcon's shields. If the Enterprise loses shields, it can still fight and keep the battle going for a good while, but the Falcon loses the whole battle as soon as the shields drop because transporters. Beam the crew directly on board, bring them to the cell block and blow up the ship. Star Wars tech does not have transporters Picard. Yeah, I gave points to Han for maneuverability and cunning but you cannot underestimate the strategic abilities of Jean Luc. This guy is a mastermind and he can draw on the support of a very large, well trained, and highly intelligent crew with varying levels of experience in numerous relevant fields. Having a Klingon advise you in war strategy is an advantage that is hard to beat in this scenario, for example. Emergency Saucer Separation. The all-too popular last resort is a pretty good fall-back plan if you need to detonate a warp-core or even give the enemy a false target. This fall-back maneuver may not be the steak through the heart but it one more option that the Enterprise has and the Falcon doesn't. Surely it could be used to their advantage, if necessary.

I really don't think it would be a fight. So what would happen is the Enterprise is chasing the Falcon. Kirk will be all like ""open.... a hailing frequency"", and of course Uhura will say ""They are not responding Captain""  Kirk will pause and look off into the distance. ""My orders... are to PEACEFULLY stop the smuggler, and.... to acquire the smuggled goods for the peaceful ferengi. HOWEVER, with no communication, then there can be"" pause again while he puts out his hands ""negotiation for a peaceful acquisition""  and for no real reason, Bones is on the bridge and will comment about how he doesn't trust the Ferengi cause they aren't human or because they are greedy, but really he's just a bit raciest towards everyone who isn't human.  Meanwhile on the Millennium Falcon Chewie will roar and the cockpit will shake and alarms and lights will go off. Han Solo will be sweating and say ""like I'm going to talk to those Federal pigs, let's put it in overdrive and see if we can lose em""  C-3PO will bitch and tell them about the odds and Han Solo will bitch slap C-3PO either verbally or physically and pull off some evasive maneuvers.   Back on the Enterprise Sulu (or the extra) tells the Captain that the ship is pulling off evasive maneuvers, with great success. Kirk will order disabling shots, but Chekov (or the extra) will comment about how they have months of advanced target acquisition training and reprogrammed the Enterprise targeting systems themselves just earlier but they can't lock on such a skilled and maneuverable ship. This is when Spock speaks while looking into his blue box thing saying ""the enemy ship appears to be able to perform a Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs"" then Spock looks up ""it is my estimate that the ship is equipped with a sort of jamming device. We also maybe dealing with some sort of ace pilot""  Kirk will give orders to manually fire at the ship (of course Spock advises against this because of the smuggled goods are on the ship but Kirk doesn't listen). The shot misses but is just close enough to shock Han Solo  So then the Millennium Falcon prepares for hyper space, and the Enterprise picks up on this. So Kirk asks Scotty what he can do, and Scotty will have to take the shields down and the weapons down in order to do it for some reason. So Kirk okay's that, and right before the Falcon takes off, Luke or Lando gets a lucky shot onto the bridge of the Enterprise or something that messes up their navigation. Then they both jump into hyper drive and they stop on a Class M planet, cause they need to recharge repair or something. Kirk takes the most important people on the ship (Spock, Bones, Uhura and 2 extras) down on the planet to look for the Millennium Falcon.  The two parties meet, and Luke uses his Lightsaber to reflect the phasers and this of course stops them from fighting cause the nameless extras died. Lando makes sweet love with Uhura and Kirk tries to get with Leia, but she's too sophisticated and smart for him. The enterprise crew finds out that the smuggled items are actually slaves with force powers or something like that and he convinces Luke to use his mind powers on the Ferengi for them to accept the Federation trade agreements and forget about the slaves.  Then at the end after they part ways, Bones asks ""So Spock you were the only one not effected by the Jedi's mind trick?""  Spock replies ""We Vulcan have dedicated our entire lives to fortify our minds. It is only natural that I was able to resist such a power, though I do admit I did feel something. Regardless it is fascinating to study the source of power of the Jedi ""  Bones looks surprised ""oh and does your superior Vulcan mind tell you where those powers come from?""  Spock says with a straight face ""I never said that the Vulcan mind is superior, doctor. I just stated facts. And no, I ran a bio-molecular scan on the Jedi with the tricorder""  Bones asked ""and what did it say?""  Spock ""apparently there are micro-organisms that live with in the host called Midi-chlorian. These allow the Jedi to use their power they call the 'Force'""  Bones laughs ""and all that religious and emotional stuff they talked about had nothing to do with it? I don't believe that, and besides I didn't get any 'Midi-whatever-you-call-it' readings when I was examining their injuries""  Spock replies calmly ""I don't expect you to believe it, and am not surprised you didn't get any readings doctor. You needed to a bio scan on a molecular level. Believing scientific fact and performing the right operations are of course logical actions"".  The End"

It's on the larger size to do so, but it fits with room for a blaster fight with a squad or two of storm troopers.  So basically, it's a big shuttle (compared to a tyderian shuttle, for example).  Probably the closest equivalent to a the millennium falcon from Star Trek in terms of size/capacity would be a Runabout. If we were talking about a runabout in a battle with the Enterprise, I don't think we'd have much of a debate."

I'd be surprised if the Millennium Falcon had 1,000-10,000x the power density of the Enterprise, while seeming to be generally similar or inferior in every other way.  The only real question is what are the relative strengths of the weapons and shields.  Then again, I guess a kid can make a sentient droid on a poor planet, in a tent, using scrap parts, and their best and brightest can make a moon-sized ship (or at least the majority of one) in only a few years, while they can't build even the simplest transporter (a technology that Jeff Goldblum produced 30 years ago with 1980s earth technology)."

About the telepathy, I think by the time TOS rolls around, the two civilizations had been separated for only 2000 years or so.  The only difference between Romulans and Vulcan were philosophical.  ENT sort of explained that Vulcan mind melds and other telepathic things were ancient practices that had fallen out of favor with the rise of science and logic.  Those telepathic practices eventually became taboo, shunned, and only practiced in secret for a long time.  Also, they thought that Vulcans who did not suppressed their emotions would probably become barbarians and monsters.  Of course, in ENT, the Vulcans managed to reconcile their ancient telepathic practices with their science and logic, so Spock can have his mind melds for TOS, and the crew of the Enterprise came across a ship of Vulcans to didn't suppress their emotions, and they seemed to be kinda ok."

The cost is low and the platform has proven that A-list actors are not required to be successful- this makes the risk factor much lower than a cable TV show.  All that being said, I don't see them doing it before finishing the current movie franchise to avoid continuity errors and/or universe confusion.

Resistance Greater than the Sum The Destiny trilogy Any Typhon Pact books that feature TNG characters The Fall (five books) The Cold Equations trilogy   I'm likely missing one or two in there.  It is a lot to keep up with, I know.  And there are greater ties with the other series than in the past (though they generally still stand apart), especially in the lead-up to Destiny (which greatly impacts events afterward).  Needless to say, it is a lot to go through.  It fortunately does not impact the book you read too much (other than helping to introduce you to many of these characters), but if you plan on reading any books that may come out later, I expect you'll want more background at some point.  As for this book, many of the characters will still be very familiar.  Captain Picard, of course, along with Cmdr. Worf, Doctor Crusher, and Cmdr. LaForge.  At this point, Riker and Troi are involved with the USS Titan, and of course, Data is not with them either.

startrek,3djxnk,StarFuryG7,19,Thu Jul 16 21:41:11 2015 UTC,Can anyone link to some images of the uniforms (TOS and TNG) under normal lighting? I'm really curious to see how they looked when not under the TV lights.
startrek,3djxnk,gowronatemybaby7,14,Fri Jul 17 00:30:46 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical about the gold tunics actually being green and appearing that way because of the lighting supposedly. The lighting would have had to be constant and consistent in all likelihood for the shirts to always appear gold. I have to imagine that certain variations in the lighting would have showed the shirt's true color, and that they wouldn't have wanted to shoot that way. More than likely, IMHO anyway, the green wraparound tunic may have been the shirt affected by the lighting, making it look green rather than its actual color, and the author of this piece got it wrong.  Of course, it's possible I've forgotten something in relation to this and am incorrect, but I don't think what I read in this article was accurate about it."
startrek,3djxnk,gowronatemybaby7,8,Fri Jul 17 00:40:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that the TNG uniforms were not really the color they appeared on screen though...
startrek,3djxnk,masasuka,3,Fri Jul 17 02:21:00 2015 UTC,"The TNG uniforms were a little more green in early episodes, and a little more red in later episodes. The TOS uniforms were a little more green throughout. This was due to the type of light used in the stages of filming. Earlier lights (60's till mid 90's) were very warm, meaning they added red into the shot, so something greenish-red appeared more gold. Where as modern lights were a little cooler (blue) so they added a little bit of blue to the uniforms.  test this out here  take the blue slider to about 50, put the green at 255, and the red at 200. That's about the colour of the uniform in sunlight. Then slide the red all the way to 255, you'll notice it turns a nice 'Captain Kirk' gold, this is the colour of the uniform with the stage lights warm light being added to the mix. The camera will pick up this colour.   This effect is why you'll still see giant lights outside on a sunny day, being aimed at actors when filming, it's so that the costumes look the same outside as they do inside on a soundstage."
startrek,3djxnk,gowronatemybaby7,9,Fri Jul 17 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they be though, when they're sold as they appeared in the show?"

startrek,3djxnk,BoomierBoom,11,Fri Jul 17 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"outer wear fabrics use commercial dies that are designed to look a certain way under the sun. Since most TV show's aren't shot under the sun, they're shot under stage lighting, the props guys have to find a fabric/colour combination that would produce the desired effect under the temperature of the stage lights.  Here's Data for example, under a camera flash, in early episodes, and in later episodes when lighting became more 'neutral' vs the cooler colours used in spot lights here, and in that image, you can even see the gold makeup coming off with the 'tears'.  also, normal vs stage lighting of Kirks uniform"
startrek,3djxnk,dannyboylee,4,Fri Jul 17 05:18:30 2015 UTC,"It's funny, in your first example you show an extremely rare version of the uniform, it's a transitional version from series 3 assembled from several pieces of fabric, you'll notice the seams visible on the chest. That version of the uniform was off colour-wise anyway."
startrek,3djxnk,ademnus,2,Fri Jul 17 09:52:29 2015 UTC,This is true. The command uniforms were actually purple.

These materials are known for how they film, and that's why they're chosen."

It's not a striking green, but a very light 'limon'. It's actually not that different.  EDIT: I might have bothered to look at the rest of the rather short thread before replying. /u/masasuka has provided image links.  The effect is caused, by the way, between the interaction between subtractive colour (the shirt) and additive colour (stage lights. Additive colour is the colour of emitted light. Subtractive colour is the colour of reflected light. In stagework, you have to figure out how different coloured lights affect different coloured objects being lit. Some great tricks are available for very skilled and knowledgeable people. When I worked in stage, we had very expensive books with true-colour plates of page after page after page of X/Y matrices of additive and subtractive colours, to aid in set and costume design and lighting."
startrek,3djxnk,sylban,2,Fri Jul 17 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"Photographer here, it's also the 'temperature' of the light. Again, warm lights will cause colours to appear different than soft lights. think of this cool lights in the kitchen, warm lights in the bathroom.  Example images over here  I used to do stage photography, and the difference between a cool spot light, and a warm fresnel flood light made stark changes in certain types of fabric, and certain dyes used in fabrics. It was quite strange as, I'd frequently get red shirts appearing purple, or blue shirts appearing green. It made some very interesting shots."
startrek,3djxnk,masasuka,2,Fri Jul 17 05:06:09 2015 UTC,"Good point, thanks. I didn't even stop to think about it, as colour temperature is something you take for granted in lighting. It wasn't common when I worked in stage, but probably is now, to spend time thinking about how it will look to certain imaging technologies, not just to audiences. But in videography, as far back as the '80s when I got involved in it, colour temperature was important to think about because of how imagining tubes pick up colour (which is different from how human eyes do). Temperature-corrected gels were available for stage use when I was doing that, but rarely used. But we used them a lot in videography, because 3600K doesn't look good on everything and everyone, and gets tiresome to look at for too long."

startrek,3djxnk,balanceofpower,21,Thu Jul 16 21:50:17 2015 UTC,"It's true, but Marc Cushman also details this in his books.   The shirts Shatner wore in the show consistently shrunk every time they were sent out to be dry cleaned, so as the season went on, the shirts got tighter and tighter, and shorter and shorter, and back in those days they simply didn't produce multiple shirts of the same garment to be worn on the show, so Shatner, along with the weight he would usually put on, especially around mid-season, were constantly problems the producers had to be wary of. Now that wouldn't be an issue really because the star would have as many shirts as he needs and they would all be tailored to fit perfectly, but back then, budgets weren't what they are today, even adjusting for inflation.

Data was a little more gold under normal light, but appeared silver under the stage lighting, although less so in later seasons/movies. think the black/blue or white/gold dress thing from a while ago, specifically this dailymail gif. It has to do with the 'colour' of the light (soft vs warm), and the intensity of the light on the subject... (more intensity, more bounce, more bounce, whiter colours)"

I think it's partially a matter of practicality, and another of privacy (similar to the issue with such technology today).  Even in the future, people value their privacy, which is the same reason why you don't really see video being taken or displayed except through a dedicated terminal (on the wall, on a PADD, computer, etc). When people are in their quarters and summoned, they do it through a terminal or the communicator (one exception I can think of is the EMH's peeping-Tom moment during VOY: ""Drone"").  Practicality isn't centered around cost (especially in an economy/society like the Federation) or the technological ability to cram such components within the communicator (we can do that even today, look at cell phones and spy cams). The issue lies in the power cost of data transmission and the longevity of the power source for the communicator. Communicators are supposed to last a LONG time in potentially hostile environments, transmit through planetary atmospheres, etc. Using a video feed from the communicator would take a LOT more transmission power and therefore diminish its ""battery life"". The last thing you want to do is lose the ability to contact your ship/help just because you wanted to get a look at whoever it was that was talking to you. Even today, there is a cell phone you can buy that has a standby time of a few months/a year that purposely doesn't have anything but voice capability. Sure, my smartphone can do way more, but when you're out in the middle of nowhere, I don't care to see who it is- I just want to get a hold of somebody. The same principle applies to military radios- video feeds can be great tools, but you can communicate enough information through voice without needing it."
startrek,3dk8xr,duodsg,9,Fri Jul 17 01:57:38 2015 UTC,I'd imagine the real reason would be budget constraints. Easier and cheaper to have the actors just  talking to each other than having to setup a sound stage of the planet/other location.
startrek,3dk8xr,peteybob,4,Thu Jul 16 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"I thought of that to, but I can recall some next generation scenes where the are cutting between the bridge and the landing party. So, the sets were already made and the actors were on camera on both sets. I guess it wasn't all the time though."
startrek,3dk8xr,peteybob,14,Thu Jul 16 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe communicators developed in the same way mobile phones have.  ""Dammit we make a communicator with fully integrated video projection but everyone just uses the push to talk feature!""  Similar to people  texting more than calling on modern mobiles.  Just a thought anyway :)"
startrek,3dk8xr,jonhydude,0,Thu Jul 16 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"You realize that they have a lot of scenes where you see the boarding party on the planet, right?"
startrek,3dk8xr,peteybob,-1,Fri Jul 17 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but once it is used as video communication then it would be expected every time the communicator was used.  That's when it becomes expensive.   I suppose it could also be said about transporters. The writers  created that to save  using shuttle craft every time the crew went to a planet. But then when shuttle craft are used fans say ""Well why didn't they just transport down?:"
startrek,3dk8xr,zerow6789,5,Fri Jul 17 07:28:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it seems largely unnecessary to me. maybe a body camera like we put on cops these days would be good for protocal violations, but you get reports and observances all the time, I think it's impractical."

If face-to-face is required, there are PADDs and computer consoles just everywhere on a starship.  There is competition for this social norm today! Some people strongly prefer video chats, while some conference call participants want to be able to roll their eyes, eat food, or cradle their head in their hands in privacy."
startrek,3dk8xr,the_one_true_b,2,Fri Jul 17 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"Of course they briefly introduced holo-communications on bridges in DS9 but that lasted about 2 episodes.    Maybe they just viewed it as inefficient.  The power cells of the communication badges can only hold a finite amount of energy and they'd need them to last as long as possible.  Your phone battery lasts maybe a day if you don't use it, several hours if you're only talking on the phone, but maybe 2 hours at best if you're video skyping or using facetime."
startrek,3dk8xr,IkLms,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:06 2015 UTC,"Probably a combination of keeping the badges small and with low power requirements, video is going to require more power to record and transmit and will require a higher bandwidth antenna.  There's also the privacy argument already made.  And just in terms of practicality, it's not really necessary.

I can't immediately think of any instance in which he used other Roman characters (such as the r, u, a, and s we see there) as subscripts.  He always used Greek letters, as we can see in the correct statement below that of the Einstein field equation (with the cosmological constant term omitted).

startrek,3diwxz,Smittee,14,Thu Jul 16 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"There are two real world explanations for why you don't see much eating and drinking in scripted scenes.   First, a lot of the time the food is a prop and not real.  Secondly, a scene isn't shot in the order it's shown. Consider a typical scene of characters sitting at a table talking. The camera angle usually changes throughout the scene from character to character or a wider shot showing everybody. The lines are not shot in the same order as they will appear in the final scene because that you mean constantly moving the camera around and having to set it back up again. Instead all the lines from one angle are shot, then another angle, and so on. If the actors were actually eating and drinking then either you would have to re-plate their food or refill their drink constantly to keep it consistent with how the scene will be edited back together, or forget about that and then fans will nitpick how the level of Earl Gray in Picard's cup goes up and down and up and down."
startrek,3diwxz,swalsh411,3,Thu Jul 16 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's why if you watch a show like big bang theory and pay attention, they mostly just sit there stirring their takeout."
startrek,3diwxz,that_baddest_dude,11,Thu Jul 16 23:01:41 2015 UTC,"This isn't just Voyager, it isn't even just Star Trek.  This is pretty much all film.  You notice it in Voyager only because that show almost always has at least one mess hall scene.  Enterprise also made good use of the mess hall, but not as often.  In TNG they used 10 Forward, which was mostly a bar, and both TNG and TOS made relatively little use of those sets.  DS9 had Quark's, but that's a bar and the characters mostly just drank drank there.  From opaque glasses, so there was no need to refill the cup for each take.  So yes, the pattern shows up and you only notice it in Voyager because of how much time they spend with food in the scene.  The reason this shows up is simply the nature of film and filming.  Actually showing someone eat is a waste of time.  The audience doesn't care if they clear their plate, we're here for the conversation.  Talking over a meal is just a natural thing we all do, when they want a relaxed conversation scene the bar or dining hall is an obvious place to have it.  It also has to do with how something is filmed.  Each scene is shot multiple times from multiple angles, the best aspects of each take are then edited together in the final cut.  Which means that you couldn't actually show the actors eating, you'd have to restock their plate and keep each cut or bite size the same throughout each point in the scene during each take.  Or they take one bite when they sit down and talk the rest of the time, occasionally taking a sip of coffee.  You also wouldn't want the ""food"" that they film with.  Usually it's a prop and not actually edible, even if it was really food it would have gone cold since it's been sitting out the whole time they're filming."

The going theory is that the replicator can gain energy back from the uneaten food, that's why it goes back in the replicators when they are done.

On TNG the same scene would have been in Ten Forward, where people occasionally eat but which is much more a bar/lounge and, in most appearances there, people just have drinks. On DS9, there are occasional scenes in restaurants (more than TNG, surely), but again, the most typical hangout set is Quarks, and again, while food is available there, mostly people just have drinks.   Basically, people on TNG and DS9 eat when the script needs them to eat. But on VOY they are shown eating practically every episode because that's the set they used for scenes where people socialize or have informal conversations."

And that was also one of the reasons why Nelix was brought on board, because he knew the region, and he knew the types of food that were edible (or barely edible for humans) that he could cook since they aware power to keep the replicators running would be scarce/unavailable. I want to say they even had replicator rationing at some point, with people trading rations for things so they must have had other food options...? They definitely did have real food though, and not just replicated stuff."

When they get infected with nano probes they develop small borg parts mostly under the skin. But once they get to a Borg ship they have to get all the other Borg parts installed manually. It's probable that a drone being able to fully shield itself requires the extra Borg hardware.

The time between ENT and TOS. I want to know about the Romulan war and the creation of The Federation. There is enough lore the build a 7 season run and enough leeway to build on.   Or.   There is a pod cast called StarTrek Outpost that I think would make a great TV series. Think DS9 mixed with VOY. It takes place on a pretty much forgotten space station in an volatile uncharted area of Federation space. I highly recommend it.

Replicated matter is constructed using a pattern held in memory from stored deuterium. Transported matter is scanned, then the matter is transferred via a matter stream to the target location where it is reassembled using the scanned pattern. Humans don't even lose consciousness during the transportation process.  Do you really think the galaxy's finest minds haven't considered the notion that the transporter kills you and recreates you? Of course they have. It doesn't.   That's why you can't replicate people."
startrek,3dg2d6,Splice1138,2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"You're saying it's the same matter being reassembled at the other end? Then how was Riker duplicated? How was Scotty stored in a modified pattern buffer for decades? Sure I think in-universe they've considered the notion, it's even mentioned in Enterprise, but I don't think an even nearly full explanation has been presented to us, the audience.  I will freely admit I'm not well versed on much Trek media other than the shows and movies themselves, but most if not all of that is non-canon speculation/extrapolation, making it little more ""true"" than a well thought out fan theory."
startrek,3dg2d6,Spocktease,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"Then how was Riker duplicated?   When a transporter beam is sent through a planet's atmosphere, there can be particulate matter or radiation present that will deflect, absorb, or disperse a small part of the matter stream. To mitigate this effect, an anular confinement beam is used to carefully maintain the integrity of the pattern as it is transferred. If the ACB fails, the matter stream can be supplemented with matter stored elsewhere.   Riker was duplicated when the Potemkin attempted to beam him through Nervala IV's distortion field. The transporter chief aboard the Potemkin initiated a second containment beam (utilizing aforementioned supplemental matter), with the intention of reintegrating the two beams at the destination before rematerialization. Thomas Riker was created when the first containment beam made it back to the ship while the other was reflected by the distortion field back to the surface.    How was Scotty stored in a modified pattern buffer for decades?   Scotty was stored by locking the transporter into diagnostic mode, preventing degradation of the stored pattern. The pattern buffer, which stores the matter stream prior to transfer to the target location, is only used to compensate for the Doppler effect. The matter stream is then sent through subspace to the destination, during which the subject remains awake and aware. There is a brief moment, while the subject is in the pattern buffer, during which he is not aware. However, except in unusual cases (such as Scotty's), this situation is fleeting.  Duh. /s  EDIT: http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Transporter"
startrek,3dg2d6,Splice1138,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"I know the basic explanations as given in the show.   If the ACB fails, the matter stream can be supplemented with matter stored elsewhere.    So you're saying the transporter will ATTEMPT to reconstruct the person/object from the same matter, but it might not. Which comes back to my original point that it isn't significantly different in philosophical terms from a replicator."
startrek,3dg2d6,Spocktease,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"But it is, because except in special cases, the subject is being moved, not generated from scratch."
startrek,3dg2d6,Splice1138,2,Fri Jul 17 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"Do that imply that, in those special cases, it would NOT be different from replication, because the subject IS being generated from scratch? As I recall in the Riker episode the characters seemed to feel that neither one was more real than the other, even if, as you imply, one was ""original"" matter and the other was ""other"" matter.  Also, this was obviously an extreme example, but how often does the ACB fail, at least in part? Is it uncommon for someone/thing to be transported as 99.999% original matter, with the remainder made up from random matter? Is this a Ship of Theseus situation?  In the context of this discussion, it doesn't really matter what you or I think anyway, it's how the characters, specifically Chakotay, view it. Do they consider a replicated item, more so a spiritually significant one, less real than a natural item? Do they have different views on a natural item that has been transported?"
startrek,3dg2d6,Spocktease,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"it would NOT be different from replication, because the subject IS being generated from scratch?   I guess continuity of perspective matters here. I concede that it does seem a little murky, the distinction between the two technologies of subspace transport and replication. But a replicated item being considered more or less real than the original specimen... I would say Picard's prized Kurlan naiskos (crash) would have been a lot less special if they could simply have replicated countless copies of it.  EDIT: Incidentally, I believe Picard did replicate his Kurlan naiskos. That would enable him to store the original safely off-ship while allowing him to keep another on display in his ready room. Further, it would explain his cavalier treatment of the artifact at the end of Generations."

Probably fairly early on. The Earth-Romulan War was a 4 year long event though, so I'm not sure if I'd want to time skip in S5 or have it extend through S6 as well. I feel like I'd want the give the the 4 year long war some gravitas by making it last 2 full seasons.  For season 7, I'd focus on the formation of the Federation in the aftermatch of the war. Spending 2 seasons on the war would give more impact to the founding of the Federation and why the Klingon Empire saw the Federation as a threat to be dealt with."

I would love to see the story of an alliance being worked towards but tragically derailed by circumstance, misunderstanding and a few lunatics on both sides leading to generations of hostility.  I think it would be great to see, after the success of making peace between Vulcans, Tellarites and Andorians, the same effort fall apart (despite our best efforts) to establish the Klingons as we knew them in TOS."
startrek,3dgpo2,IkLms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:19 2015 UTC,I think a big problem of the series was introducing the Klingons too early. They should've been held back until the second season at least: have some build-up to their first appearance.
startrek,3dgpo2,scottishdrunkard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I liked the Klingons mostly in Enterprise. I like that the species meet when Archer both saves an important Klingon and unwittingly strips away his honor. It fit in perfectly with Picard's explanation of the ""disastrous first contact"" between the two species where a lack of understanding of Klingon culture led to generations of conflict.  I also like how they were used sparingly. I liked how Archer's trial established that Klingon society was starting to devolve into a pure warrior culture. I even liked Durass as a cartoony evil guy. I like too how the Klingons would be likely to blame humanity for imposing their features on the Klingon species and disregard that we also saved their species from plague.  Unlike the Borg in Voyager, I felt like there wasn't really any Klingon episode that weakened their story potential. (I wouldn't miss the Magnificent 7 Klingon marauder ep but oh well.)"

I can already think of a way to get Trip back too following the cloning method the in season three.

Be advised, most Trek is less polished, less fast paced than the 2009 movie. But it is also more complex, interesting, character driven and emotionally satisfying. I'm a big fan of the new movies, partially because they're great fun and partially because they get people like you interested.  Spock is one of 5 or 6 characters that define Star Trek--uniquely compelling, full of potential and with the power to elevate storytelling into something unlike any other TV."

I will say most of them really rely on a reader's existing emotional connection to the characters. The books may be kind of unsatisfying for a Trek newcomer. I'd really recommend diving into the shows.  You could start by going through the Original Series by looking at IMDB to see which episodes are top rated.

I am a fan now thanks to that same movie, and I'm grateful for that.  To be honest, if I was zapping channels in 2009 and stumbled upon TNG, my reaction would have been (and was, actually): ""oh, is this space soap opera where they talk a lot and they use those silly rubber costumes and call them aliens"", and I would immediately change the channel without giving it a second tought, because that is what my judgement of trek was thanks to the memories I had when I was a kid (TOS and their rubber suits), but trek'09 makes trek shines in a different light for a different era, and ta-daaa, new trek fans everywhere (and sad long time trek fans too lol)."

Bach, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Bernini, Leonardo - all produced works that are still amazing centuries later.  How come the movies suck so bad?  The writer conclude that it's because the modern Christian movies are made to preach: they are not an expression of the artist's idea, they're just an attempt to get others to convert.  They aren't telling stories, they're just dressing up sermons and calling them stories.  By comparison, Bach wasn't trying to get anyone to convert: pretty much anyone who came to church to hear his music was already a Christian.  Who goes to the Sistine Chapel?  At the time - and probably still - mostly Christians.  The same is true of the others: they didn't need to neglect their art in order to try making a sermon about conversion.  They could just make art.  This movie, based on the description, looks like it would be a sermon about the evils and insanity of religion, instead of being a story told just because it's fun to tell a good story.  So it would almost certainly have sucked completely: as the article notes, the ideas ended up in the first and fifth movies, both usually regarded as far and away the worst of the films with the original characters."

Unarmed space liners? Seems like the Nausicaans et al would feast on those.   I imagine space piracy is extremely rare deep within Federation territory, so there should be little to no problems found along normal spacefaring lanes.

startrek,3dh7eb,StargateGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"Unless you can back that up with actual producer statements, that's correlation, not causation.  Nemesis, as I recall, was always billed as the final TNG movie. The cast was getting old, and Insurrection was nowhere near as successful as First Contact. They had the cast signed for a final movie.  For the reboot, Paramount gave the normal justification for a reboot; ""we want to attract new viewers,"" ""the old continuity is too complex,"" and so on."
startrek,3dh7eb,Kant_Lavar,0,Thu Jul 16 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"You're trying to justify the weakest performing Trek movie. Had Nemesis been better, more TNG movies would have undoubtedly been made, or some DS9/Voy movies. Nemesis was the final straw after a succession of continuously weakening Trek movie sales.   Sadly, that left us with a pair of action movies with a Trek paint job on them. And a slew of lens flares in every shot."
startrek,3dh7eb,StargateGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Nemesis was a great movie. Yes, it didn't do well, but I suspect that was as much to do with following Insurrection as anything else. People were getting burned out on Star Trek and that meant they were going to wait to see out on DVD.  Again, unless you can produce a definitive statement that says ""we would have made more TNG movies if Nemesis had done better"" your contention that it led to the reboots is logically flawed, especially in the face of it having been billed before being released as the final TNG movie.  Regardless, I'd say Nemesis was okay. Not good, but okay. It had some interesting story ideas around family and nature versus nurture. The execution was a little flat, but it still had some interesting points, in my opinion."
startrek,3dh7eb,Kant_Lavar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"Insurrection was bad, but it didn't trigger a reboot.   Neither did Nemesis.   It got a reboot because someone wanted to make action movies under the garb of star trek."

Every time somebody wanted to exceed warp 6, they either had to ignore the previous episode altogether or come up with some kind of gimmick to avoid further damage.  I'm glad they abandoned the idea. The Federation didn't retaliate against the Romulans for the same reason the US didn't retaliate against the Saudis after 9/11.  The Romulans in 2009 were bad actors, not acting with support of Romulus.  It would have been stupid to retaliate against an Empire that had nothing to do with the attack.  Especially after losing half the damn fleet, and one of the most important planets in the Federation.     Like I said earlier, we need to get out into space.  An invasion would only mean we are once again stuck with ""Star Trek at war"" and it would probably all occur in Sector 001.    I would like to see the Enterprise discovering some thing new and interesting and dealing with some real moral dilemmas."

startrek,3d7txx,io_la,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"You said he has a ""marked propensity"". Then you give a single shaky example...from the past. Come on.   First off, it wasn't shaky. People didn't like it at the time, and he got the brush at a number of Trek conventions after it happened. One crowd refused to applaud for him when he came out on stage at at least one of those appearances --I think it was at one of the NYC Conventions, but I'm not sure because it was such a long time ago. But a lot of people found it offensive and insulting at the time, and who could really blame them? They were the ones helping to keep him employed and successful at the time after all. Secondly, it wasn't the only time he made a remark like that. I recall him having done on it on at least one or two other occasions afterward as well, I just don't remember the specifics as to what it was that he said. That's not to say he isn't a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but he's also made it clear that he wasn't exactly a fan of the genre either. He came right out and said so in the roundtable discussion that he did hosted by Whoopi Goldberg quite a few years back.   Everything about his reputation and behavior counters your assertion.    Oh, please --I wasn't making this stuff up. I remember it because it happened.   People are always trying to make trouble where there isn't any.   I think you need to lighten the hell up yourself actually. I have nothing against Frakes and wouldn't hold those things against him if I ever happened to meet him out there in the public. I'd shake his hand if he was willing to shake mine, and I might even ask him for an autograph, even though he's not one of my favorite performers from the various Trek shows and films. I just remember that on at least a few different occasions he came across as insensitive to the fans, which is something I don't ever recall Patrick Stewart having done in contrast, for instance. Stewart by comparison has always been very classy and adoring of the fan base, and it's easy to remember that about him because I don't think there was ever even one time where he said something dismissive towards any of us.  edit: typo correction"

startrek,3d8wsa,elijahsnow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:34:23 2015 UTC,As far as I remember we've known since the 80's that it was probably a reddish tinge.  It changes with seasonality of course but when Voyager 2 imaged Triton and found it to be a reddish hue it was strongly suspected Pluto would be similar (based on them both being assumed to be KBOs).  It wasn't confirmed until later though and I guess I made it sound like we've known since the TOS days that it was red which I didn't mean to imply.  If they did it back in the day it was probably a lucky guess more than anything.  If this is from the remastered version then it's probably done on purpose as we had strong indications it was red(ish) by the time they did those effects.
startrek,3d8wsa,pcweber111,2,Tue Jul 14 19:03:47 2015 UTC,It's definitely a remastered shot. This shot my not even have existed in the final edit of the original broadcast as TOS had many many many scenes cut due to budget and technology constraints.

startrek,3d8wsa,pcweber111,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"Triton wasn't thought to be a KBO in the 1980's during Voyager's flyby. Far from it, they actually theorized that Pluto must be an escaped moon of Neptune. I'm not sure back in the Voyager days the idea of the Kuiper Belt was already fully fleshed out (or realized). The other KBO's were only discovered in the mid-90's, I think.   The reddish hue was mostly known from Hubble images, afaik."
startrek,3d8wsa,tadayou,0,Wed Jul 15 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"TNOs were known to exist far before Voyager 2, just the proper KB was not in use until the 90s.  Of course not all TNOs are KBOs but for discussion the two are fairly interchangeable.  Pluto was never seriously considered an escaped moon of Neptune because of it's orbital eccentricity.  Same with Triton.  Triton was a retrograde orbiting body too so it was pretty obvious it wasn't a natural satellite of Neptune.  True the wording of KBO wasn't widely used until around 92 or so but that's just semantics really.  Both Triton and Pluto have been assumed for quite awhile to either be from the Kuiper Belt (later on) or at least were TNOs (early on)."

startrek,3d45ow,Mozared,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself a question based on the scenario as it is: would the sub be better without these threads? They're easy enough to ignore for those who don't like them, and r/startrek is not so active that we're being cluttered by stuff like this or such. So the question becomes 'why not'? By disallowing posts like these we'd only be only cutting down content that some may find interesting, and we wouldn't really be helping anyone. Live and let live."
startrek,3d45ow,slappymcnutface,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:34 2015 UTC,"Did I call for banning these threads? No, I didn't.   You misread my post. I'm saying these are shit posts and that I'm annoyed by them. That's all.   But while we're on it, I do personally think we should restrain ourselves from only submitting things of at least moderate quality. I prefer a less active subreddit full of content than a shitty but active one. This isn't my subreddit so I don't make the rules, but that is my opinion."
startrek,3d45ow,Mozared,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"Did I call for banning these threads? No, I didn't. You misread my post. I'm saying these are shit posts and that I'm annoyed by them. That's all.     I'm not misreading anything, I'm trying to extrapolate some meaning from what you're now telling me was really nothing but a rant. It sucks for you that you're annoyed by these posts, but I'm telling you there is little that can feasibly be done about it. That's all.   But 'while we're on it': my point was that the choice wasn't between 'a less active subreddit full of content' and 'a shitty but active one'. The choice is between 'a less active subreddit with little content' and 'a regular but active one with some ""shitposts"" '. With Star Trek being a somewhat dead franchise (only the movies are still being made at the moment), there simply isn't enough to talk about to keep the sub constantly fresh. Simple posts like these shake things up a little bit, however much they may 'annoy' you. I'm not saying they're amazing content, but if you'd remove, ban or prohibit threads such as these you'd barely see a post a day or so in here. It's a lowering of standards to keep the ball rolling, really. And honestly, I don't think a ""happy birthday -big star trek icon-"" thread is of such a low standard that it bears complaining about."
startrek,3d45ow,slappymcnutface,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:48:01 2015 UTC,"Again I don't know why you keep talking about banning. ""I'm trying to extrapolate some meaning from what you're now telling me was really nothing but a rant"" is exactly misreading my post. It was just a rant and you keep bringing up banning.   I just don't see how keeping a level of shitposts keeps a subreddit alive. You keep sick people alive with Saline not mashed up chicken nuggets and gatorade.   My point is these kind of posts aren't any better than nothing at all. /r/DaystromInstitue is a great example of how a Star Trek community can still thrive even though it is only good content. Shitposting is shitposting and it shouldn't be defended anywhere. No subreddit ever maintained its quality by subsistence on shitposting."
startrek,3d45ow,Mozared,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except you're defining ""congratulating someone with a tie to the subreddit's subject with his birthday"" as 'shitposting'. At its worst a post like that is a bit of a filler, and my argument has consistently been that these things do not harm subs. Not unless there is so much of it that genuinely good posts simply get filtered out (Askreddit comments come to mind). Which isn't the case on r/startrek, nor has it ever been. And if you really don't understand why I 'keep talking' about banning (or removing or prohibiting, whatever word you want to use), then explain to me how you want to create a community 'without shitposting' without enforcing a 'no shitposting' rule. I'm listening."
startrek,3d45ow,slappymcnutface,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:39:30 2015 UTC,We can shame people into not doing it?   I don't actually expect my one rant of a comment to change the subreddit. I was essentially gauging how poorly my comment would be received and if anyone would agree with me. The first step to dealing with a mess is acknowledging it in the first place.    This wouldn't be the first sub where a number of complaints eventually led to the community changing its rules or downvoting posts they agreed they didn't like.

startrek,3d84oe,Arcaness,2,Tue Jul 14 06:41:23 2015 UTC,"The Federation: The Federation will have allies in The Klingon Empire, possibly The Hirogen, and possibly The Romulan Empire. This leaves up to half of your proposed groups united to face The Borg together, while the Dominion, Cardassians and Breen likely take a wait-and-see attitude. The Klingon Empire: The Klingons will likely side with The Federation from the outset, particularly against the Borg, Dominion, Cardassians, and, if need be, Romulans. They'll see the Hirogen as a sort of kindred spirits, and be natural allies. The Hirogen: They respect the Federation and owe them a debt of grattitude for the holo-technology and other aid given to them. They have an honor code and a society similar enough to the Klingons in structure to find common ground for an alliance. 3/8 of the powers in this scenario working together from the outset is a good start for the top three. The Dominion: The Dominion is likely to attempt to entice, coerce, or threaten everyone but the Borg into joining their side. This will backfire with all but the Cardassians, Breen, and possibly the Romulans. They'll sit out the conflict with The Borg, letting the Borg inflict as much damage as they can to The Federation and any of The Federation's allies, before taking their turn. Whether the Dominion can actually overcome the Federation's alliance depends on what the Romulans do, and that is why they're ranked so low. The Romulan Star Empire: The Romulans' very nature is to not interfere directly in others' affairs unless they must, and the Borg is the one threat where they will likely feel that they must. They'll likely side with the Federation in the short-term, but whether they'll attack the weakened Federation after the battle with the Borg, remain loyal, or withdraw to their own space is a far from certain conclusion. With the uncertainty of the Romulans' motives given the vagueness of the exercise, I can't rank them any higher. The Cardassian Union: The Cardassians are, on the whole, very short-sighted. They'll side with The Dominion early, and unless they're joined by both the Breen and the Romulans, won't easily have enough in sheer force to overcome even a post-Borg-conflict Federation-led alliance. The Breen Confederacy: The Breen are like the Romulans in many ways, except that they're even more unpredictable, don't have cloaking devices, and won't pick sides until they're sure the side they pick will win with their help. Being sandwiched between the Federation and The Borg on the map doesn't help, they may well get caught in the crossfire without any allies. The Borg: The Borg are the obvious losers in this exercise, as they've never been interested in maintaining relationships with other races, only assimilating them. Their superior technology to all, and superior communications will not matter in the face of at least three other factions attacking them together. The only way the Borg win this is if the factions not fighting them attack the Federation and it's allies while they're fighting the Borg. The Borg would then be free to assimilate much of the Alliance attack fleet, strengthening their forces while the other deplete their own.   If you had included the Ferengi, I'd have ranked them above The Dominion, as they would've sided with either the Dominion or the Federation, depending on which they saw as more profitable and why, and would have likely had no qualms about switching sides if need be, and that's IF they didn't decide to just sit back and sell weapons and supplies to one or both sides from the beginning."
startrek,3d84oe,mattwrotethis,2,Wed Jul 15 04:01:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I don't have much to add, except that I'm very surprised the Borg ranked as the absolute lowest faction (also I would have put the Breen higher; we saw just how unpredictable they could be and how useful that was when they struck Earth and got away with few losses). Even with 3 powers fighting them, they could cause major damage with their advanced technology, and to some extent get stronger after every victory. I wouldn't rank the Borg number 1 like many have, but I think last place is an overstatement.   Also, unless the Ferengi found help in one of the two blocs, they would just serve as assimilation fodder, further strengthening the Borg. It would have to be seen whether the Ferengi were short-sighted enough to choose profit over alliances. They might think the Borg will pass them over...  The Hirogen are interesting. I'm not sure they would immediately ally with anybody. I see them totally ignoring the set start boundaries (they are nomadic, after all) and striking stragglers in hunting parties, not organized fleets. They would see trophies where others would see allies; Starfleet captains' pips, a Breen helmet, Cardassian neck bones. The war would be a big game to them. And while it might be successful for some time, it might also get them killed."

The Borg are last simply because they are the universal threat. All sides will see them as a threat from the beginning in your scenario. They aren't surviving this. They lack subtlety needed to induce conflict elsewhere like the Romulans and Cardassians could, they don't make alliances, and they offer nothing to the other factions except as a possible distraction.

If he had reason to disagree, he would do so, often in public or at least in front of other significant players, but in a way that never seemed to challenge Picard's authority.

startrek,3d2ueo,tidux,3,Mon Jul 13 10:48:00 2015 UTC,It's true. The first time I saw the Missile Crisis footage I was blown away that it was used in ST6.
startrek,3d2ueo,HesSoZazzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:28:25 2015 UTC,"The Cuban Missile Crisis was less than thirty years ago at the time STVI released, so I'm sure that was intentional.  It was a subtle reminder of just how close to the brink things were between the Federation and the Klingons."
startrek,3d2ueo,lunarhugs,9,Mon Jul 13 23:14:19 2015 UTC,"Loved it too and it's still a must-watch several times a year. When I first saw it in the theatre, I got teary-eyed when the credits rolled.  It drove home that ST6 was the last TOS movie and that was the end of an era for me. Being an overweight teen with poor self esteem, I anchored myself in the TOS universe. It helped me get through some pretty hard years and the ending hit me pretty hard."
startrek,3d2ueo,N121PB,10,Mon Jul 13 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite aspects of that movie is that everyone gets a thing. The whole cast gets a thing to do.  spoilers   Chekov finds the blood.  Uhura has to translate when they're flying through Klingon space  Bones gets a ""holiday"" and has a great scene trying to save Gorkon   Sulu rides in as cavalry   Scotty gets the sniper  Kirk and Spock do their many things(including mind rape:-/)  It's one of my favourite films,not just Trek films,but films."
startrek,3d2ueo,danatblair,5,Mon Jul 13 10:42:42 2015 UTC,I actually thought that the way Uhura was portrayed in that scene was rather insulting to the character. You don't think that a seasoned communications officer like her would know some Klingon and not butcher the language while needing to rifle through some dictionaries? It was good for some cheap laughs but in the end did a disservice to Uhura.

Part of the reason the Berlin Wall came down was because the USSR was already beginning to fall into decline. To put it in a more modern context, this is like arguing whether the Xindi arc in Enterprise was a parallel to 9/11, or to the War on Terror. It's essentially different chapters of the same event.  The nearest historical parallel to TUC is probably the peace talks that resulted in the Berlin Wall being dismantled."

startrek,3d2ueo,lewisniven,3,Mon Jul 13 12:54:40 2015 UTC,"This. It doesn't take too much away from the movie, but there are parts where it can be a bit distracting. I'll never understand why the set designers decided that using translucent curtains to (barely) hide the Ten-Forward windows was a good idea.  Still, I understand the budgetary reasons for needing to use existing sets as much as possible. We'd probably have lost out on some of the off-ship scenes if they'd decided to spend the money on Enteprise sets. Imagine the movie without Rura Penthe or the Klingon courtroom."
startrek,3d2ueo,FoldedDice,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:01 2015 UTC,"The one that irks me is the engineering one tbh where we get the shot down the warpcore of Scotty and co looking up through the glass window, it's such an 'iconic' TNG set that is kills the immersion a bit.

startrek,3d2ueo,Viper_H,4,Mon Jul 13 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"I remember being at my local cinema the night this movie was released. I was about 13 and my cousin had free tickets to see Freddy's Dead: The (ahem) ""final"" nightmare and I was just blown away by all the trek fans there that had dressed up in some kind of Star Trek related theme. It was really impressive to see the various outfits and....well, aliens. I'd always liked the other trek movies but didn't even know about this one so it was really cool having it brought to my attention like this.  Unfortunately I never got to see it at the cinema, but it did make me reconsider watching TNG on tv, which at the time was something I'd never really got into but I'm glad I did. Finally I got to see it on VHS the day it was released. Such an awesome movie and an excellent way to close the chapter for the original crew. So many great quotes....  ""That was not his knee.....Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.""  And ""I'd give real money if he'd shut up.""  ST:VI was the movie that made me appreciate and enjoy all the trek that followed."

startrek,3d2ueo,Bionic_Bromando,2,Mon Jul 13 11:59:46 2015 UTC,"I have always loved this movie.  Perhaps it is because I only saw any of the TOS movies after they had all been released on VHS or TV, but I liked it more that The Wrath of Khan.  Don't get me wrong, that is an amazing movie in its own right, but I think much of the love for it comes in the gigantic leap forward in quality that it represented for Star Trek as a franchise.  It was the first time that anything with the name Star Trek on it was presented with a sense of realism and grittiness to it; ST:II took itself seriously in a way the franchise had never seen before.  ST:VI did the same thing, but improved on just about everything that ST:II had to offer aside from perhaps the emotional gut-punch of losing Spock.  It also was one of the first depictions of the Federation as being less than anything but utterly pristine and perfect, even going so far as to color the core characters with touches of prejudice we had never seen before.  Honestly, that is probably the only real problem that I have with the movie; the lack of consistency with the rest of the established canon in that there had never been an inkling of racial hostility towards the Klingons on the part of the Enterprise crew before.  Still, on its own merits when viewed by itself, I think it works quite well."
startrek,3d2ueo,tulwinn,2,Mon Jul 13 12:22:27 2015 UTC,It's the best one! Honestly the only bad scene was the one where they shoot the Klingons in zero gravity and the early CG blood looked really bad.

startrek,3d2ueo,Blue_Dog_Democracy,2,Mon Jul 13 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"St VI was the first movie I was allowed to see in theaters without my parents.  Even without that bit of personal nostalgia, I would put this one as 1st or 2nd in the original movies. The story didn't feel forced (ala IV and V). The villain felt dangerous. One of the contrivances was part of the plot (the escape from prison), though the other one is pretty bad (the tracking device).  Still, when someone asks me what original Trek movie to watch, this will be my first recommendation. STII is great, but isn't as accessible to new fans, IMO."

I think Wrath of Khan is more accessible than the relatively inside baseball-ish ""peace with the Klingon empire"" plot of VI. You're not really required to know any information beforehand to enjoy the movie.  That doesn't mean I don't like Undiscovered Country, though. I'd say that II and VI are the best of the original series movies."

In the Khitomer scene, he's dazed after Kirk knocks him to the ground, and then when he's standing up he's looking at the dead Klingon on the ground instead of whoever Kirk is talking to.

startrek,3d5kfg,daemose123,4,Mon Jul 13 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm just gonna copy from the last time I answered this question, six days ago. It's a re-posted quote from a previous time I answered it, four weeks ago. Check those threads, there are some other great answers there as well. Point is, this gets asked a lot. ;-)  I love this question because it's an opportunity for someone new to discover one of my favorite sci-fi universes. The sidebar actually has a stupendous guide for this exact question. It's a big franchise with a lot of great entry points depending on your background and what you're looking for.  One critical thing to recognize, no matter where you start, is that the first season or so of any of the later shows (The Next Generation aka TNG, Deep Space Nine aka DS9, Voyager aka VOY and Enterprise aka ENT) are all a bit rocky. There are some bad episodes, there are even some real stinkers. Like, episodes that even die-hard Trekkies consider some of the worst fiction ever written. There are also absolutely monumentally good episodes. All of the series' get better as they go along, so if you're kinda-digging a particular one you can begin to skip around a bit and check out some of the more universally-loved episodes. For TNG there isn't much continuity to worry about, VOY and ENT there's a bit more but it's not killer; DS9 is one giant arc, The Dominion War, for pretty much most of the third-through-seventh season. Not every episode is about the war but that story is in the background of everything. For DS9, once you get to know the characters I suggest skipping forward to the second season finale, ""The Jem'Hadar"".  The original series (aka TOS) is great right from the start, but it's a half-century old and very much a product of its time in terms of acting, visual effects/sets and attitudes about certain things. It's a truly great show worthy of its legendary and iconic place in television history, but watching it for the first time as an adult now you have to take some of it with a grain of salt."
startrek,3d5kfg,TheCheshireCody,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"Chronological order: http://thestartrekchronologyproject.blogspot.com/2009/09/and-now-we-present-complete-star-trek_19.html  I'm doing it at the moment. Which started me off with Enterprise, a show I almost completely skipped when it was airing."
startrek,3d5kfg,SJR_TheMagician,4,Mon Jul 13 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. There are too many things in Enterprise that are intended to be seen only after watching the other series'. The Gorn, the Tholians, the Orions, the Borg, the Romulans, the Klingons, the Ferengi, the Organians. Plot points, technology and even characters will make far less sense without an understanding of what they were originally. A huge part of Enterprise is the difference between the Vulcans of that time and the Vulcans we are familiar with. I mean, an absolutely central part of the show.  There are a handful of episodes of the 'trilogy of shows' - TNG/DS9/VOY - which should be watched before other episodes in other series' (you'll have a better understanding of Q in Voyager if you've seen him in TNG; you'll know who Tom Riker is if you've seen the TNG episode where he first appears, etc.), but for the mostpart it makes no difference, except that Enterprise should be watched later because of the points made above.  Beyond that, the lesser quality of Enterprise might turn people off to Trek."
startrek,3d5kfg,TheCheshireCody,3,Mon Jul 13 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"Yah, I've noticed that with Enterprise. But I've seen all of TNG, a bit of TOS, and a a fair bit (though not enough) of DS9. I wouldn't recommend this order to somebody new to Star Trek, but perhaps to somebody that has seen it, likes it, and now wants to be a 'completest'.  Some of the episodes between TNG and DS9 are best if you've seen them in order, mostly with the Borg stuff."
startrek,3d5kfg,SJR_TheMagician,2,Mon Jul 13 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend this order to somebody new to Star Trek   But ya basically did. ;-) It's like recommending the Machete order to someone who's never seen Star Wars! It totally blows Yoda's cover in ESB, and a bunch of other things. Or Chronologically Lost - you want to totally ruin somebody's potential appreciation of Lost, have them watch it for the first time in chronological order."

startrek,3d5kfg,Organia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"Watching DS9 overlapping with TNG and VOY is not really necessary though   There are a couple of crossovers between TNG and DS9, which makes it worthwhile, but there's only a couple seasons of overlap between TNG and DS9. I agree that you don't need to watch Voyager overlapping with DS9, because you don't need to watch Voyager at all."
startrek,3d5kfg,philwelch,2,Tue Jul 14 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest watching at least a few episodes of the original series first.  It's very dated, but I think it helps at least build some context for the later shows.  Watch at least Space Seed, Balance of Terror, and some other classics, which I'm sure you can find on google.  Next, watch the movies.  The Motion Picture is decent, Wrath of Khan is a must-watch, and Search for Spock and Voyage Home are also great.  You may also watch Undiscovered Country.  Next, watch TNG all the way through.  It's phenomenal!  Then, watch Star Trek Generations and First Contact.  The other TNG movies kind of sucked.  After that, you can watch DS9, or Voyager, or both, or neither.  People have mixed opinions about them.  I personally like Voyager and hated DS9.  Consider them both as spinoffs, which they pretty much are.  I would not really suggest watching Enterprise, but I guess you could try it."
startrek,3d5kfg,kengou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"I personally started with The Next Generation, it's not as entry level as Voyager. But it's pretty solid and generally sets the tone for what is to come. DS9 is what I watched 2nd and it can be hit or miss for some people, it's my personal favorite but there's very little exploration so if you aren't into the lore and relationships (and badass conversations) you may want to save it for later. The only issue with that though is I would recommend watching Voyager next and I personally don't think it can compete with tng. But I actually did like it quite a bit even though there are a few parts where they contradict things that were introduced in THE SAME SEASON. It can get aggravating. Watch enterprise 4th because let's face it you have to really be craving some star trek to punish yourself with this one. It's easily the worst trek but it has its parts and has some interesting arcs. I would watch TOS last because I think it's only after you've seen all trek has to offer that you can fully appreciate it. And it is good even though it takes itself way too seriously from this future point of view its pretty campy but considering when it was made its pretty damn good. And it also sets you up perfectly to go ahead and start watching tng again. And then ds9. And so on and so forth until they day i die."
startrek,3d5kfg,Crapgeezer,0,Thu Jul 16 00:10:47 2015 UTC,All you need to know is save the best TV show for last with Deep Space Nine.  If you watch DSN first then you'd think the other shows sucks stinky ass.

startrek,3d13q4,JamesTiberiusChirp,13,Sun Jul 12 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Originally, it was to change things up after the quiz show scandals of the 1950s.  Here's Merv Griffin's explanation:   My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York from Duluth. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful ""question and answer"" game on the air since the quiz show scandals. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: ""5,280"" – and the question of course was ""How many feet in a mile?"". Another was ""79 Wistful Vista""; that was Fibber and Mollie McGee's address. I loved the idea, went straight to NBC with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.   And, if anyone's ever wondered why the show is called ""Jeopardy!"", here's why:   Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, What's the Question?, when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, ""It doesn't have enough jeopardies""."
startrek,3d13q4,raaaargh_stompy,11,Sun Jul 12 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"In Jeopardy, you are given the answer that you have to find a question to. Thus, your answers are framed as questions."
startrek,3d13q4,phtll,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"... but what? Questions are (in e.g. trivia) are determinant, but answers are not?  Put another way, the question ""How many toes do I have"" has only one answer: 10. But the answer ""10"" is the answer to loads of questions (what is 5 plus 5).  So if you are only given the answer... even if there are catagories... this is a crazy way to run a quiz show, you could come up with loads of responses that are valid.  And... furthermore... the question""  ""What is three men and a baby""  is not sensibly answered by  ""Leonard directed this 1987 comedy about bachelors looking after an abandoned infant""  That just makes no sense, it's answered by   ""A 1987 comedy directed by Leonard Nemoy about  bachelors looking after an abandoned infant""  This game show is crazy."
startrek,3d13q4,JamesTiberiusChirp,4,Mon Jul 13 01:12:13 2015 UTC,"That's the central conceit of Jeopardy!. I don't know what else to say. The ""answers"" heavily imply only one or a few possible ""questions"" in response, which have usually been anticipated by the writers. But fairly often (at least once a week or so) they'll come back from commercial with an announcement that they've reconsidered someone's answer in the previous segment and found it valid."
startrek,3d13q4,phtll,2,Mon Jul 13 02:10:42 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that the answers given are vague yet specific enough to have to have a very specific question that prompts for it. Certainly no other question would be the prompt of ""A 1987 comedy directed by LN...."" Something a a vague as ""10"" would never be an answer prompt on this show. And I don't think it's meant to be directly answered (Or as you put it, ""sensibly."").  This show has been on the air for at least a decade and is very popular in the states. So whatever they're doing, it works."

Wheel of Fortune is the other. Since the primetime game show fad (Millionaire, Deal or No Deal, etc) died down they're probably the highest rated game shows period, but I'm not sure."

I always thought he was the best choice to succeed Williams if new Star Wars soundtracks were required. With all respect to John, he is 83 years old now.

startrek,3d2prf,Khamelyon,16,Mon Jul 13 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this too lately, and I had a few theories:  At first I thought maybe it's because Voyager is an agent noun. The -er ending indicates agency which might make it much easier for us to interpret the word Voyager as a proper name rather than a description, and proper names generally don't take articles in English. But ""The Stargazer"" sounds fine to me so I'm not so sure that works.  It might instead be because of the setting. When characters talk about Voyager they're not just talking about a ship, they're talking about a self-sufficient community, a group of people bound by a common goal. Dropping the article makes it sound more intimate, like Voyager itself is a character in the show.  Another theory is that it's simply from the name of the show. We don't call the TV show ""The Voyager"", we just call it ""Voyager"". So it's only natural we transfer that usage over to the ship itself. This also explains the usage on Enterprise. On that show they also dropped the article early on in season one, despite earlier Enterprises always having ""The""."

startrek,3d0yup,neg8ivezero,4,Sun Jul 12 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"From the sound of your experience, TOS will be a very enjoyable series for you! I love TOS, it is my favorite iteration of the Star Trek universe, not because it was the first, but simply because it was the best balanced and had the best ideas, in my humble opinion.   TOS uses the characters as archetypes of human behavior and then puts those archetypes into fantastic situations that often underscore social issues relevant in our own culture. Spock, Kirk, and Bones are 3 aspects of humanity and we learn through the series how each of these aspects affect our choices and direction as a species. What the series seems to say about humanity is very profound if you have the desire to listen to it. I think TOS does the best job at exploring humanity and our motivations than any other iteration of ST. I also think that the characters from TOS are never successfully recreated in other forms of media (exempting, of course, the TOS films)  Spock is never successfully recreated on any other medium that I have seen- Leonard Nimoy's Spock is a one of a kind character and he is INCREDIBLE. The audience needs to see what pure, calculated, logic brings to humanity and how logic should play into our important decisions. He is a rock of rationalism amongst some very emotional characters. His contrast with Bones often highlights the constant internal struggle humanity faces between doing what we KNOW is right vs doing what FEELS right.   Kirk is a great captain in TOS and that is lost a bit in the new movies- I think you'll enjoy seeing his character develop throughout the series.(City on the Edge of Forever is an episode where you can really see how Kirk has developed as a person) He is somewhere between Spock and Bones and depends on both of them a great deal to temper his own views. Kirk often times marries the advice of his crewmates and acts in a compromise of their ideologies but sometimes clearly dictates that one of them is in the right/wrong. He is the most relatable of the three main characters, to most people for this reason.  Bones is the last part of the holy trinity here and his character in TOS is a bit one dimensional but necessary to bring a very real ""human"" aspect to the team. Kirk brings bravery and intuition but bones brings human tradition, stereotypes, and judgement. Things that are hard for us to grapple with as a society but none-the-less part of our human condition. You can see this role filled in later iterations of Star Trek by various cast members but no one does it quite so purely as DeForest Kelley.  All in all, it is one of, if not ""THE,"" greatest sci-fi television series ever created and I think you will have a fantastic time exploring it! A word of caution, it is not easy when the series is over and you realize that this show was made in the 60s and there is zero chance for you to reconnect with your favorite characters again.   EDIT I a word"

startrek,3d0yup,StarFuryG7,3,Sun Jul 12 18:02:53 2015 UTC,"I can overlook the outdated special effects in turn of good plot and universe   Which version did you watch? The Blu-ray releases had all the special effects redone using CGI.   It could actually be its own movie   It was in a way. It was the original Pilot and is a standalone story, which was the most expensive production of its day.   The critique of overindulgence in fiction rather than reality leading to a civilisation's downfall was interesting as well, albeit somewhat ironic, I found. A lesson to take into consideration for sure.   It's an allegory, which the original series episodes were known for, and were usually handled quite well.   What do you guys think of the first episode?    It's a solid science fiction story and holds up well when compared to the series pilots for the other Trek series' that came later. I also like the second pilot that features Shatner though, and I think you'll enjoy that one as well.   Any interesting piece of info you can give to a newbie like me? :-)   It looks as though other people have already given you a lot of information. Jeffrey Hunter, who played Captain Pike, decided he wanted to focus on doing movies, which was why they then hired Shatner as their new series lead. He was very much in demand back in those days, and the producers were very glad and felt lucky to get him.  The younger people here tend to bash the original series, but every so often an uninitiated viewer such as you drops in after having to decided to finally sit down and give the show a look and end up really enjoying what they saw. As one of the older people here who grew up watching the original series in syndication as a kid, it's quite refreshing is all I can say. I wish there more people here that feel the way you do about the show.  Bear in mind if you continue watching that there are some episodes you won't be thrilled with and won't like after seeing them, but I encourage you to stick with the series for those episode you will enjoy.

And of course there were always TNG reruns on and Voyager was airing. So I guess I never felt that separation between TOS and the other shows.   Well, I think that's an important distinction, because a lot of people in your age group, and younger especially, were apparently either not really exposed to TOS, or didn't care to bother with it while growing up. I know that in the mid-to-late 80s, especially after TNG hit the airwaves, it wasn't aired much at all. It really didn't surface again for quite a while until the Sci Fi Channel decided to start showing it along with interviews from the actors who had guest roles in the show during extended commercial breaks, and running the episodes at ninety minutes instead of an hour. And when they did that people complained that the episodes were too long, which they were in a way because they were also loaded up with commercials too, but it was great to see some of those interviews as well. A great special could actually made using all those interviews as a matter of fact, with some of those actors, such as William Campbell, no longer being around anymore, having passed on. Sad, but they were a great contribution for posterity, and nothing will probably ever be done with all those interviews, sadly. Who knows if the Sci Fi Channel still even has them buried away in good condition in a vault somewhere.  Anyway, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday, and stick up for TOS when you see the younglings here taking stabs at it.

I do remember the SciFi channel run of it with all the interviews though. That was really cool.    stick up for TOS when you see the younglings here taking stabs at it.   I will definitely do so. While it may have been a bit difficult for people to get into TOS if they were kids in the height of the TNG era, I think now is a perfect time for a big resurgence in popularity for it. In fact I think it has already started happening, even if that isn't always reflected on this sub. I mean now we have it available on DVD and BluRay, almost every streaming service has it, there are the remasters for people who may not enjoy the lower budget effects, and of course the new films are bringing awareness to it by using the same characters so people who want to see more Trek with Kirk and company will look to TOS and the TOS films.

On one hand, this effort has rebooted the franchise and gotten a whole new generation interested in Trek, that has to be good, right?!  On the other hand, I don't find the new movies to be consistent with the universe/characters that were established in TOS. I can get over all the action, the weird casting choices, the lens flare, and all the action movie tropes but something I can't forgive is how they destroyed the characters. Especially Spock.   Spock is half human, yes, but he CHOSE to live the life of a vulcan! The new spock has apparently not chosen this life, he has instead chosen to be a human who sometimes acts like a vulcan.    He has a girlfriend (Uhura), despite the fact that he is seen to have the genetic predispositions of a Vulcan in TOS (He goes through Pon-farr).  He actually CRIES in Into the Darkness... I don't understand why more people don't talk about this but that is RIDICULOUS! Not only is it entirely out of character for the Spock from TOS, it is even out of character for the Spock from the 2009 movie, it's own predecessor! The Spock from the 2009 movie watched everyone he ever knew die as his entire home planet got blown up. Not. A. TEAR! Second movie, he sees a friend die and he bawls like a human.   This is crucial because it throws off the best part of TOS, the interaction between the 3 main characters. Spock doesn't represent pure logic anymore, he really just represents a fairly logical human. He is a very watered down version of his original character and that, in turn, waters down the resulting philosophy of his interaction with characters who are SUPPOSED to be completely different from him.   If these two things were changed in Spock's character, I would like the new movies a LOT more than I do. I think there is a magic in the chemistry between Spock, Kirk, and Bones. If you want to try and build a movie off of the original series, you need to at least TRY to recreate that dynamic. You need 1 cold, rational, practically emotionless person, 1 brash, head-strong, and honest character, and 1 judgemental, old-school, traditional type character. The new movies threw this formula out the window and just made their own characters while stealing the names from TOS."

EDIT: Also, I think the warp jump effect from the first movie (BOOM, gone) was pretty sweet too. The glowy white tunnel while they are at warp is pretty stupid, though, and like much of the special effects in the movies, was painful to look at for too long."
startrek,3d0jif,gravitydefyingturtle,3,Sun Jul 12 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"I thought Pegg was awful, and the lines they wrote for Quinto were entirely un-Spock like. Quinto himself was a good spock. He was great in the first movie, retarded in the second."

startrek,3d0jif,izModar,3,Sun Jul 12 20:36:02 2015 UTC,Well he'd certainly make a good older version of Chris Pine.
startrek,3d0jif,gravitydefyingturtle,3,Sun Jul 12 21:03:30 2015 UTC,Pine nailed it. There's a scene early in the first movie where he gives a smirk that's just so kirk that he won me over. Originally I was so excited about Quinto because physically he's a match but nimoy has this gravitas that Quinto just can't match. There's this kind of nervous energy to Quinto that doesn't match a Vulcan makeup. Tim Russ as Tuvok had that same kind of powerful calm that nimoy projected and quinto's missing that.

He rebooted the series in a way that created buzz about Star Trek amongst people who are not Trek fans. Great casting for pretty much every role The Technology point, like OP mentioned The stories mixed in a great bit of old nostalgic Trek with new stuff. It was an excellent mix to where it still felt like Star Trek, WHILE feeling new and refreshed at the same time The movies were very well made. Yes, there were some writing issues, but overall these were excellent movies. The pacing was great. The action was well done and meaningful (unlike Star Wars). Everything tended to have its purpose   I can boil the flaws in the first 2 movies down to 2 things.   There are countless times where the writing just made things too ""unbelievable"" or took people out of the movie. Many times this could have been fixed with a simple additional line of dialogue or consulting with a high-level-knowledge Star Trek fan. For example, the whole ""Transwarp beaming"" thing has really been a stupid addition. There had to have been better ways to show Scotty as a talented engineer. All they should have said was that the Enterprise was in orbit still, but they still needed to find a way on.... yadda yadda yadda. Instead we get this transwarp beaming thing that allows you to transport people Light years away!!!! Hooray!!! Warp drive is no longer necessary guys! Star Trek Into Darkness did not further the story/franchise in any meaningful way. There was not a huge need to bring back Kahn, but they did it and it unfortunately did not have much of an impact. The first 2 movies end in almost the exact same way, on Earth with Kirk realizing that he can be a true leader and blah blah blah. There was too much reliance on old Trek references in STID. It really started to blur the lines between useful action and meaningless action as well (i'm looking at you, chase scene on foot through San Fancisco)   Overall, these movies did an excellent job and were exactly what they needed to be. They could have been cleaned up by making relatively minor changes to close up plot holes and stupid dialogue. Ultimately I blame Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann for most of the issues. They have made nothing but really shitty movies for the most part, and they were the head writers for these 2 first movies. I am so glad to see them gone (from the writing staff, I know he is still a producer) and off ruining other franchises (Transformers, Spiderman)"
startrek,3d0jif,2011StlCards,21,Sun Jul 12 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"I'm still baffled that Khan was brought back to begin with. The first film didn't have that kind of fanservice, and it tried to tell its own original story that caters not only to normal moviegoers, but also to the veteran Trekkies. That was thrown out the window with Into Darkness, and we got an illogical story that's trying to be too much like Wrath of Khan, and it suffered for it.  I'm pretty happy that Star Trek Beyond won't be reusing the plot of the other Trek films, judging from what I've heard about it."
startrek,3d0jif,TheQuantanamo,13,Sun Jul 12 16:05:01 2015 UTC,That is the biggest thing. I could have accepted Kahn coming back IF IT WAS DONE RIGHT. They had a very thin bullseye and they missed it. It could have been a brand new awesomely-written villain that might have been refreshing and great.   Buuuuut no. They decided to go for the nostalgia factor and it honestly did not work.
startrek,3d0jif,2011StlCards,8,Sun Jul 12 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"In another thread I posted the idea that Cumberbatch could have played a new augment.

startrek,3d0jif,izModar,6,Sun Jul 12 20:31:57 2015 UTC,Exactly they could have done much better things with the character along the same lines without making him kahn.   Your idea would have been perfect. It would connect the movie to the old franchise without having to bludgeon us over the head
startrek,3d0jif,2011StlCards,8,Sun Jul 12 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"Khan could've been an awesome villain if they'd played it right.  Set it up so that he was found much earlier in the timeline and inserted himself (and his augments) into key roles in Federation politics and Starfleet, pulling the strings from behind the curtain, ultimately being responsible for the greater technology and miliartistic bent of Starfleet in the new timeline.    Instead we got punchy-McSuperman the wonder mutant.  Or someshit."
startrek,3d0jif,jarhead-in-germany,6,Sun Jul 12 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"That would've been interesting: Khan and his crew active for years. ""Yes, it appears we will do well in your century, Captain...""   I would be hesitant to chalk up the improved technology being the result of their influence, though (the USS Kelvin scanning the Narada is pretty satisfactory for me) since I found the ""Khan designed our ship and weapons"" element of Star Trek Into Darkness a bit hard to accept. It makes more sense that it would be Jochaim who'd be the technical genius(he piloted the ship and repaired the Warp Drive in WoK after all). Cumberbatch should've been Jochaim pretending to be Khan. (Sorry, I look for every excuse to link to that image, hah)"
startrek,3d0jif,BigTaker,3,Mon Jul 13 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to say I agree with #1. I've always been a tech geek, but never was part of the media culture such as Star Wars and Star Trek. This year in college, I finally watched all 6 movies of Star Wars, however it never quite appealed to me. Then, having watched the first two Trek reboots, I remembered I told myself I was going to start watching Star Trek. Started with TOS 2nd semester, and now I'm a few episodes through TNG Season 5. And I've loved every minute of it. Sure, some episodes have their lowpoints (I mean, what can you expect, with 20+ episodes per season, surely they won't all shine), but for the most part, I love the future that it has painted out for humanity. Sure, it's not utopia, but they're always striving for it, to improve theirselves. And I think that is one of the greatest messages Star Trek speaks of: To improve one's self."
startrek,3d0jif,UDK450,4,Sun Jul 12 22:05:45 2015 UTC,I agree with most of your points. I would enjoy the movies quite a bit if they just didn't call them Star Trek. JJ stripped out the intellectualism. That ruined it for me.
startrek,3d0jif,fourpac,10,Sun Jul 12 17:15:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and I would not say that the new movies needed to be that much more ""intelligent"". They just lacked the basic ideals of ""Science Fiction"". Other than time travel, there really was no thought provoking matter in the newest films.   Things like ""Red Matter"" pissed me off to no end. I do not understand why it would have been so difficult to give it a more realistic, science-based plot device. It would not have been that difficult!!! Just literally 1 or 2 lines of dialogue would have turned it into something acceptable"

Generations was a joke, First Contact was a space-zombie action movie, Nemesis was just... terrible, with dune buggy demolition derby racing. Insurrection was insulting, the actions of the Enterprise crew and horndog Picard completely flew in the face of ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one"" theme from 15 years earlier.

startrek,3d0jif,XtimmyX,4,Sun Jul 12 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"I think the Nick Meyer films are the only ones that are, even if they're still primarily action vehicles. The Wrath of Khan had some themes about aging and dealing with death, and TUC had some great parallels to the fall of the Soviet Union and making peace with your enemies.   STID at least tried to make analogies to post-9/11 America and the dangers of sacrificing freedom for alleged security, the rise of the surveillance state... Kirk's speech at the end of the film is actually a pretty good one. ID had too many other problems for me to consider it a good film though..."

The point is that Star Trek was designed in large part with the intention of masking social commentary behind aliens, and Gene used it that way repeatedly through his entire tenure on two different shows. But as our society has evolved, Star Trek has fallen behind the social curve instead of staying ahead of it. The nuTrek films particularly egregiously so. It's a large part of why said films don't truly merit the Trek label. The specifics of what particular aspects of social justice Gene might have been better or worse at don't really matter."

Now this is not to say that you should cheapen the franchise (which I would NOT say the movies did), but you do need to make it accessible to a larger audience nowadays. Diehard Trek fans alone are not numerous enough to bring in the kind of money that is needed to keep the franchise alive. They could not keep making Star Trek IV over and over again and expect wild success.

Those movies were trying to be action films disguised as old people doing scientific things.  Yes, these new movies did not focus on the science as much but that is not a crime in my opinion. Nor does it cheapen the series.  Just remember most of the reason that much of the tv series avoided big action was budget restraints. This adversity led to better writing because they had to be better.   Yes, the new movies are not as intelligent as Star Treks 1-6, but they are very well made films. They could have been as bad as the Star wars prequels but they werent done in such a way. I would not consider it a crime at all. Hollywood is a different thing than it was in the 80s. You have to cater to your audience and they did it well.   If you let this cheapen the rest of the franchise then I am afraid you missed the point.  There was no future for the franchise by going to same direction as they had been. Interested needed to be re built and this did it very well."

I really like the new beaming effect and the way transporters were  used (for the most part) in Abrams' first film.  I liked the idea that you had to stay still in order to get a good lock on a person. Transporters have always been problematic, implausible, created plotholes and killed dramatic tension, so anything that puts limits on their capabilities is a-okay.  I liked the swirling energy effect and how creepy it is in this scene from Into Darkness.   I'm ignoring Khan's portable transporter that sends him all the way to the Klingon homeworld in the sequel.  I liked the jumping to warp effect in Into Darkness the most, as the 'warp trail' is a nice callback to the original films."

Not to mention that with the TMP era warp core in particular, it appeared to run through the entire ship - up the neck of the ship to that blue dome thing behind the bridge (""impulse deflection crystal"" - apparently has something to do with the warp drive given that the Reliant lost warp drive after the Enterprise hit it) and one of the scenes in TWOK shows another horizontal pipe running all the way back from the engine room.

startrek,3d0jif,GeneralRose,7,Mon Jul 13 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"True regarding the aesthetics of the films and some great casting decisions (Quinto, Urban).    But there are so many annoyances in those two films.  Just to name a few:   The uninteresting and out-of-character romance between Uhura and Spock. The script turning Spock into an emotional being, constantly overreacting to events, exactly the opposite of what makes the character interesting in the first place.   Kudos to the actor (Quinto) for being able to give the character some credibility given the whimsical writing. Young Kirk seems constantly overwhelmed by events (especially in STID, where he is always losing strategically).  Again, this is out of character, and a dubious rewriting decision.  The original Kirk was arrogant, but he appeared in control and on the top of things, one step ahead of his adversaries.  This is what made him appealing as a captain.  The films do not really instill in viewers a taste for science, knowledge and discovery, elements that gave the franchise its very identity.  Rather, the films relied on explosions, over-the-top action sequences, buildings and planets destroyed, not to mention an uninspired foot chase between a hysterical Spock and Khan.  The laziness behind the conception of elements such as ""red matter"", as was pointed out by another commenter, and the quasi-absence of references to actual scientific theories. The superficiality of the moral dilemmas integrated in the plots.  Most episodes of the Trek series (TNG, DS9, for instance) offer a much more interesting take on difficult political questions, more so than the underdeveloped theme of the response to terrorism in STID.   The unnecessary destruction of Vulcan, home to one of the most interesting species in the Star Trek canon.  This is not Star Wars, and there is no need to destroy planets to make a Trek story interesting. The overall fuss associated with a bizarre alternate universe narrative, building upon no convincing scientific speculation or concept (e.g. the concept of multiverse and its implications could have been explored and exploited to make viewers think and appreciate those aspects of the plot).  The fact that the ""death"" of Kirk occurs too early in the rebooted franchise: at that point, the relationship between young Spock and young Kirk had not been developed sufficiently to make this event meaningful and emotional for viewers.  In contrast, the event in Wrath of Khan came after three seasons and one film developing the characters, making the death of Spock much more shocking. The cartoon-style writing of action sequences.  This happens very often in action films today, where writers use cartoon-style formulas to stimulate viewers.  For instance, McCoy running behind Kirk and injecting him with substances as his limbs swell, while they are facing an emergency.  This may trigger automatic reflexes of hilarity among a younger audience (the target audience) who have been conditioned by those writing formulas used all over the place in animation and cartoon TV series.  But it's not brilliant writing."

Yeah sure the JJ reboot changed things and added elements that were never there before but the original series was incredibly campy and cheesy albeit still great.   The original series had a serious lack of depth when it comes to the characters and the true emotional relationships between the crew didn't come until the films. Something JJ did that had never been done before was establish these characters with an origin. It showed you why they work so well together. Kirk might be overwhelmed but wouldnt you? He just started straight out of the academy as a captain. The show started during the 5 year mission when Kirk had already experienced his origin.  The lack of depth in science and diplomacy you can 100% attribute that to the studio. Big studios think science and talking scares people away from theaters which it kind of does.  The alternate universe had to happen, the destruction of Vulcan had to happen, things change in reboots. Would it really be interesting at all if it was the exact same thing as the original series?

Moore, René Echevarria, Jeri Taylor and others took over and managed to create the best science-fiction series ever.   And this influence extended to DS9 and Voyager, which are generally very well written too, and recognized as such.  What worked is that episodes of this era kept the essence of the original series (the science, the ethics, the diplomacy, etc.), while removing the campy stuff.    I can understand that they wanted new blood for the movie reboots, but it's difficult to accept a generic action movie after witnessing the quality of those TV series.     Big studios think science and talking scares people away from theaters...   That's the part where I tend to agree with you.  But I am not sure this is a warranted assumption from the part of those producers.  It sounds instead like they lack imagination.

startrek,3d0jif,cuteman,2,Mon Jul 13 02:02:25 2015 UTC,I thought the first 10 mi utes of the 2009 movie was excellent and showed what modern trek should look like.
startrek,3d0jif,Diactylmorphinefiend,3,Mon Jul 13 07:12:48 2015 UTC,"Almost (but not quite) everything.  The first of his films (yeah, Into Darkness was pretty horrible), was closer to ToS in tone, spirit, story than any other Trek that's ever been made, including TNG.  Which is why we old-school Trek fans who grew up on the original all love it, and younger fans of the post-TNG or DS9 era hate it."
startrek,3d0jif,bookant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:39:19 2015 UTC,I think you're forgetting TMP and V which captured the feel of TOS perfectly. They're also the films least liked by fans
startrek,3d0jif,GeneralRose,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"I wasn't forgetting them, I was just including them when I referred to the ""original"" Trek.  My ""original"" meant original series and the films.  But . . . . We didn't like TMP when it came out because of badly it missed the tone of ToS.  It got the ""thought provoking sci fi"" part right but it completely fucked up the characters and their interaction/relationships with each other and completely lost the lighthearted tone and sense of fun of ToS.  It tried way too hard to be ""2001"" and forgot to be Star Trek.  You don't see it mentioned very often, but V was really just a remake of the episode ""The Way to Eden.""  Space Hippies take over the Enterprise and hijack it for their spiritual quest for paradise/god.  Not one of the stronger eps of ToS, though."
startrek,3d0jif,bookant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:38 2015 UTC,"I think TMP nails the relationships of the crew. You have Kirk facing his life after being captain. Admiral Kirk, like the audience, wants to be back on the Enterprise of his youth with his old friends.      Spock is still at war with himself and who he is. But he comes around and realizes that be must embrace some of his more human emotions and desires.      Bones is just as crotchety as ever.     Decker and Illia are newcomers and there's a new focus on them. I found them interesting, but they do take time away from the rest of the cast.      Unlike the series, there is very little comedy in TMP. It is a serious film and has no room for lightheartedness. In it's immediate sequel the theme of Kirk dealing with his age is once again explored"

Kelvin is one of the high points of the entire franchise in my mind. They're out there doing science. The dialog is so fast and conversational. Robao flies right into the teeth of the mining ship and doesn't effing blink. You can viscerally feel George's determination to save everybody at the cost of his own life...  Then they jump cut cut to the cliffs of Iowa and it's all downhill from there. Not because Star Trek is bad for an action movie. But because the intro shows that they have the chops to make a new-BSG kind of story. But they're not gonna. Because explosions."

Especially Quinto, who looks exactly like 1960s-era Nimoy in some promotional pictures.  The caveat is that I don't think Simon Pegg looks or acts too much like James Doohan. Chris Doohan does a much better job in Star Trek Continues (which I also think is a much better effort than ""JJ Trek"").

Then I watched ST 2009 and STID and it was really cool, with all those eye-candy fight scenes and stuff. Beside awesome visuals it made me appreciate the foundation it was built upon, lit the interest to the franchise and here I am, with TOS, TNG and ENT watched and enjoyed, trying hard to make it through 1st season of DS9.

startrek,3d2krl,Multivers,3,Mon Jul 13 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"To me it implies the Bolian guy was taking Picard's feigned interest in the topic as genuine and Picard was trying to be polite and get out of there without admitting he hadn't read it. Then again I haven't seen the movie in years so maybe I remember it all wrong.  Although if Picard is interested in the topic that wouldn't be too strange. Being a captain it makes sense that he'd keep up to date on the latest research, even if he only has a basic understanding of it."
startrek,3d2krl,ubernerd666,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"One way or another, plot-wise it was a lost opportunity to give Trekkies a nod by having the guy ask about an archaeology paper.

I don't have a list of everything referenced in TNG, but I do have some personal favorites....  Hamlet is my favorite Shakespearean play, and I also really enjoyed Macbeth. There's a really great film version of Hamlet with Patrick Stewart and David Tenant.  From China:  Journey to the West -- it's part adventure and part satire, and deals with competing philosophies. The ever-popular Monkey King character features prominently. The translation I read was 4 volumes (and worth it), but there are probably abridged versions too.  From Celtic folklore:  The Mabinogion   Táin Bó Cúailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley)  These are interesting because they come from people who were not the dominant culture in their homelands. I think these old legends have a lot to teach us about ancient cultures, and how people adapt to conquest. There's some really thoughtful commentary of the Mabinogion stories at http://mabinogion.info/  From Mesoamerica:  Popol Vuh -- mythic accounts of Maya creation, migration, and hero journeys. It's pretty neat."

Edit: also the fact that they introduced the queen borg always bothered me. It took away the scariest idea about the borg and turned them into James Cameron Aliens. In my opinion, the scariest part about the boards is that they are anti Federation. The Federation embraces individuality and freedom, and the Borg were always opposite of that"
startrek,3cyr4s,rabidwampa,10,Sun Jul 12 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't get the hate for the reboot. IMO, when an old franchise gets revitalized it's always a good thing and I think the new movies are pretty good. It got people who thought ""Star Trek is for nerds"" to actually like Star Trek and explore more. A friend of mine didn't like Star Trek, even after I explained different aspects of it that I enjoyed. However, after seeing the two new movies, he actually told me he was watching the older Star Trek movies and TNG episodes and enjoying it.  I get that it's not ""Star Trekkie"" enough, but honestly, if they made that movie we'd probably hope for a sequel instead of expecting a third and possibly fourth new movie AND an interest for a new Star Trek TV series.   Small side note: I really loved the old movies/TV shows as a kid, and even though the special effects weren't something to write home about, I always imagined them to be bigger than what was happening on the screen/TV. Seeing the Enterprise take a beating or Nero's ship firing rockets into the starships, or even the hand to hand combat brings me back to those moments."

The whole Kelvin sequence, holy shit. Incredible. My only gripes are about stuff like transwarp beaming and ""how did Kirk become captain so fast"" and so on. Still a great movie. Saw it 6 times in the theater.  Into Darkness, on the other hand, is just a lousy crappy movie. What a horrible and nonsense plot, and a missed opportunity to grow the characters.

It's sealed what I've kind of felt for awhile - The Undiscovered Country is the best Trek movie.

The problem is, I never should have to ""turn my brain off"" to enjoy Star Trek.

I just don't think the recent trek films benefited from being trek films or set in the universe of star trek, maybe they should have used a different IP or a new Space IP ?  Didn't all the previous star trek films use the TV casts ? and with that all the characters had been very well developed allowing the film to then just be a big outing so it didn't really matter if the films were action based a bit lacking in depth or simply cheesy."

I was harshly put upon by my friends, family, school mates etc. for not acting like the tough, sporto, macho assholes of the time. And unfortunately Trek (Original Recipe) got lumped in with all the poorly produced, poorly written, campy shlock sci-fi of the times, ex.-Lost in Space, My Favorite Martian, etc... But Trek had some great things going for it early on. Unfortunately for Trek (TOS) it was guilt by genre association.   Then after Star Wars was released, entertainment in the genre was kicked up- it was cool to like the genre. Then along came computers, video games and new tech gadgets almost weekly. All of a sudden the pin-head, jockos needed us techno geeks to plug in their answering machines for them and so on. At the same time the jockos began to ""experiment with video gaming. They themselves could come out of the closet and openly like nerdy stuff as long as in was sporto video games they played.  Now, 50 years later, its as common and acceptable to geek-out on Trek Talk or Comic or Gaming talk as it is to ""pin-head"" out on footballer stats. They have Super Bowls and they paint up and cosplay football teams. We have Comic Con and cosplay our own favorite genre characters. Yes there has been the continued poorly written work in genre. But now we have so many other choices if something is poorly written.  We vote with our money and the work hopefully gets better. The openness encourages discussion.  Fortunately no one has to be a closet geek any longer. That all ended with the main stream of the genre, popularity of video gaming, the advancement of tech, and general acceptance of fans of the genre."

startrek,3cz4o7,BoJackSin,60,Sun Jul 12 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"This is dead wrong. All the TNG movies are horrible action movies with stupid, transformers-level scripts.  Even if they werent, you're still way off as in the 80s and 90s, Star Trek WAS huge, it was the original mega franchise with 10 movies and 4 shows in a 20 year stretch. Meanwhile Marvel and DC were fighting bankruptcy and George Lucas did nothing but vandalize his own movies like that crazy kid at the end of your street who breaks his toys because he's bored.  Lastly, I hate this ""Star Trek is for smart people"" garbage, just as many idiots watch Star Trek as any other franchise. It's not some Palme d'or winning masterpiece, it's just a fun adventure franchise with bad acting, cheesy effects, but great mythology and world building, and most importantly, good stories. The technobabble that required a doctorate in bad Sci Fi writing had nothing to do with Trek's greatness, and anyone who thinks it is was part of the problem. There are no stories in GOOD Star Trek that are overly complex or difficult to digest by general audiences, in fact some of the biggest movies ever, such as Jurassic Park or Avatar, follow the same morality play/allegorical story telling techniques that we love in Star Trek, Age of Ultron and Winter Soldier did this as well.  The Berman era Trek died not because people were too stupid, but rather the franchise became stale, formulaic, and lazy. Manny Coto did his best to bring it back to its original glory but it was too little too late and obviously needed a complete overhaul to be successful again, which JJ accomplished, fortunately.   As regards the OP, the Enterprise, Kirk and Spock, beaming, warp speed, etc, are all as large parts of pop culture as Batman/Spiderman, etc, and they will always be."

The fact that they had to do this shows that they knew the show was for a different audience.  But I never meant to imply that the show was too difficult to understand, or at all complex, just that these kinds of stories aren't terribly interesting to the typical moviegoer.  Anyone can understand the stories of star trek, but they don't all get what there is to love in it.  Also, lets not fool ourselves into thinking that people are going to the marvel movies or the latest jurassic park for the depth of story.  They want to see Iron Man flying through the sky, Hulk smashing, and T-Rex fights.  They are there for the action, and that is not what star trek is about.  It is a different kind of show for a different audience.  The action sequences in the show were only ever a minor device to move the plot forward."

Nah buddy, your post explicitly states, ""Excluding the latest movies,"" However we can go there if you want, there's tons of CRAP in the Trek TV library as well, and there has never been a point where a Star Trek show was clearly HEAD AND SHOULDERS above everything else on TV at the time in terms of quality, with the REST of TV being a pool of sludge for idiots. The closest it came to that happening was probably the last couple years of DS9, meanwhile the terribly stupid Voyager ran at the same time.   They wanted to attract the same audiences that are now enjoying marvel/star wars/DC movies. The fact that they had to do this shows that they knew the show was for a different audience.   You mean the audience they lost in the 90s? Yeah casuals aren't going to be loyal to something like Voyager and Insurrection. That's true. I don't see how it has anything to do with them being dumb. I feel like it's smart to not waste your time and money on junk that isn't even trying to earn your attention. Seriously, why would you accept an inferior product? It's no shock that ratings and box office receipts nosedived as the overall quality of the franchise lowered.    Also, lets not fool ourselves into thinking that people are going to the marvel movies or the latest jurassic park for the depth of story. They want to see Iron Man flying through the sky, Hulk smashing, and T-Rex fights.   You're implying that people only want one or the other, people can want action AND a good story, and AGAIN this applies to Star Trek as well. People want a good story AND the Enterprise going to warp, McCoy muttering, and Kirk fighting alien monsters.   Your idea that these audiences are somehow mutually exclusive due to intelligence is silly. It's standard fanboy cognitive dissonance, ""insert movie wasn't well received because people are DUMBER than me and it was too smart.""  I could see if this thread was about Transformers 4 or some terrible crap for the masses, but Marvel/Lucasfilm/Disney seems to be working very hard to make a great product that is worth everyone's money and it's all consistently enjoyable. Stop insulting the makers and the people who watch the movies because of crab mentality. The last 5 or so years of Berman-era Trek was horribly stupid crap, whether on TV or in film. Manny Coto salvaged Enterprise but it was too little too late. Even though I hate your argument, I'll use it to state this, anyone who likes Insurrection or Nemesis is probably 5x as likely to be a moron than a random person who liked The Avengers.  I already know that your next reply will have something to do with JJTrek dumbing it down for audiences by being a generic action movie or some other boring excuse even though the movies are great and stand with the best of Trek, whether you consider them pure or not."

The SHOW is what is ""not just explosions and fights.""  Anyway, as I mentioned, there is a clear difference between the star trek movies and the show.  When they made the movies they knew they wanted to reach a larger audience, so what did they do?  They took out the thoughtful plots, and put in action.  They knew what they were doing, and they do it in the newest movies to an even greater extent. They understand the differences between the audiences they're trying to reach.  We can draw conclusions from that alone, but to clarify, I don't believe it takes greater intelligence to understand the stories of star trek, but that people who don't get star trek are those who don't see what is beautiful about it.  Furthermore, I don't mean to insult all these popular movies.  Avengers is awesome, and even though I disapprove of them, the new star trek films are fine as well.  Everyone likes them.  However, we have to acknowledge that the star trek shows and movies such as these are not intended for the same audience, and thus the version of Star Trek from the shows will not ever be as popular as Avengers and the like.

Roddenberry tried to be a bit more thoughtful than the average show at the time, but make no mistake: he grew up on westerns, and Trek was an action show, first and foremost. Hundreds of thousands of kids didn't crowd around the TV every week to watch Kirk debate ethics. A good deal of the episodes are downright silly."

I think the argument could even be made that until the recent boom in comic book movies, Star Trek was a bigger part of pop culture than comics stuff. Maybe in recent years it hasn't gotten as much attention as the comic book movies, but Star Trek has had two movies verses Marvel and DC which have had A LOT. But even at that the Star Trek movies have been hugely successful and have brought attention to Trek that it probably hasn't had since TNG was popular. Though it is true that Star Trek does not tend to merchandise as much as other big nerd things like Star Wars, which can affect how much it infiltrates the public psyche.   Though I may be overestimating how popular Star Trek is because I'm also a huge fan of Stargate and very often have the awkward moment where I reference an episode and just get a blank stare. ""Have you ever watched Stargate?"" ""No, but I've heard of it. I think.."" That hardly ever happens with Trek. People at least know enough about it to recognize most obvious references."

People were fascinated by the cast making the jump to the big screen a decade after the show went out of production --back then things like that just didn't happen, and in the wake of the success of ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek"" had what was then a rare opportunity to really excel in popular culture. However, the first movie turned out to be a long and boring dud, and people other than truly hardcore fans lost interest and never really looked back, and that has a lot to do with why Trek on the big screen never fully recovered or took off in that format the way it might have otherwise IMO.  I think ""Wrath of Khan"" should have been the first Trek movie. It would have performed better than TMP at the box office in my opinion because the reviews would have been more positive, and it would have been something that casual and uninitiated viewers would have been able to relate to more easily and enjoy. I also think there would have been less of a 'Trek fans are nerds' stigma attached to the property had that otherwise been the case instead."

Sure it's not as popular as star wars. But star wars is so entry level it takes very little dedication and effort to be a fan. You watch a few movies (half of which legitimately suck hardcore) and you're good to go. Plus it relies waaay too heavily on extended universe in my opinion its honestly embarrasing. I mean as a star trek fan we've got close to 530 hours of pure canon, granted out of all that there's a few episodes I don't care for but on the whole it's quality and I enjoy it. So sure there are more star wars fans and its a more socially accepted subculture.

Analysis of the battle from ""Sacrifice of Angels"" showed no less than ten Galaxy-class vessels in the combined Federation fleet during Operation Return. This would indicate that there were more than the initial six Galaxy-class starships referenced in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual. The total of six ships stemmed from Roddenberry's assumption that Starfleet would not have constructed vessels of that large a size in substantial numbers. The Manual however also stated that an additional six space frames were constructed and laid up to be completed at a moment when circumstances so dictated. It can be conjectured that those circumstances arose after the first Borg incursion and that by the time the Dominion War began, all the remaining original Galaxies were operational. It could be theorized that a ""Galaxy-wing"" would be much like modern battle groups with lighter frigates/ships screening the main capital ship(s) (which would make sense due to the size and firepower of a Galaxy-class starship)."
startrek,3cz6w1,tidux,5,Sun Jul 12 17:28:29 2015 UTC,"iirc Starfleet only had ordered 6   That was the initial order.  There were more than six Galaxy class ships in one camera shot on DS9 IIRC.

startrek,3cz6w1,gowronatemybaby7,3,Sun Jul 12 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but as the Galaxy class did its job much better and more completely than the Ambassador, it has stuck around.

Hmm, I am inclined to imagine that the Galaxy class was a jack of all trades designed when the Federation thought it reached a height of authority in its space. It's big and can carry a lot of people (and has tons of weaponry), but its also a big target that can hold a lot of potential casualties or borg assimilation fodder. It would just be better for the Federation acknowledge a need to change direction when new enemies emerged (the Borg and the Dominion. haven't started watching DS9 yet, so I could be totally wrong.)  You can make lighter, faster ships dedicated to battle, which might answer why Voyager is faster than Ent-D.

Outside of large CGI fleets in DS9, we don't see a preponderance of Galaxy Class ships either. Perhaps the Ambassador Class is still out and about in deep space exploration?  In reality, I don't think the Ambassador Class was fully designed until the Yesterday's Enterprise episode in TNG Season 3. Even so, I don't know why it wasn't shown more frequently after that. It is a great design- probably my favorite."
startrek,3cz6w1,the_one_true_b,3,Sun Jul 12 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"I always thought that the prevalence of Miranda class ship in the Dominion War was because they simply recommissioned a lot of mothballed ships and got them as up-to-spec as possible, flying them with skeleton crews just to pad their numbers and bulk of the fleet size."

Certainly you still saw them around as late as ""endgame"", so they were still around, but maybe it's harder to upgrade Ambassador-class ships for some reason - that Miranda and overthrow classes are small, but robust and easily conformed to newer Starfleet standards.   Put another way, like upgrading a tower pc vs trying to take apart and upgrade an iPad. For the older models, you can just (I know it's a little more complicated than that, but stick with me) throw in a new component, but for something as designed-out as an iPad, you'd spend so much time and energy trying to take it apart, conform new parts, and reinstall it that it wouldn't be worth it, especially when there's a new generation available."

The Excelsior must have been a fairly cheap ship to construct and, with the constant upgrades it saw to its design it was never truly obsolete, being a perfectly serviceable warship during the Dominion War. Maybe the Excelsior is like the Volkswagen beetle... somewhere there's a random shipyard churning them out like that factory in mexico that kept making Beetles till the late 90's."
startrek,3cz6w1,metakepone,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe, like the Beetle and the Toyota Corolla (the car that succeeded the Beetle as the world's best selling car), the Excelsior class was built in large numbers because it was practical and reliable, and possibly, fast and cheap to fix and possibly to upgrade. It might have also hit the sweet spot of sizing of a starship, the Enterprise D/Galaxy class is too big to make one for every crew, but the excelsior is a big enough to carry a few people around and be a good, agile warship."
startrek,3cz6w1,CX316,2,Sun Jul 12 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"Well the Excelsior was quite a step up from the Constellation, wasn't it? Size-wise I mean. And clearly from what we see of them, they can take a pounding, although their shields clearly needed some work during the war. Ambassador Class seemed to be more of an attempt to make a flagship like the Galaxy class, but it was too small and underpowered for that role compared to the next generation of starships that superceded it.  The Excelsior started its life as the starfleet equivalent of a Ship Of The Line. The biggest, meanest starship on the block. However as other ships were made that were better than it at that role, rather than being retired, they were repurposed into cruisers, then to frigates, then to corvettes as the rest of starfleet got bigger and not just more powerful but more space-reliant. You couldn't have families on an Excelsior ship like you could on a Galaxy. There just wouldn't be room.  On a slightly more practical reason, it could be because they would have made a bunch of models of the Excelsior for Star Trek 6 around the same time Next Generation was being filmed, so there would have been plenty sitting around to be used for TNG, which meant that they just had to come up with a reason why the Excelsior had survived as a class for some 80-90+ years while so many other classes only get a good 10-15 before retirement."

With the somewhat unspectacular service of the Ambassador class, Excelsior was the capital ship of the fleet and until the launch of the Nebula and Galaxy classes, was probably reserved for the best captains in the fleet."
startrek,3cz6w1,the_one_true_b,2,Mon Jul 13 13:28:46 2015 UTC,"Someone made a good post a while back about this, so i'll try to paraphrase and add my own thoughts.  The Excelsior had been the backbone of Starfleet since the decommissioning of the Enterprise-A, and since they signed the Khitomer Accords with the Klingons their biggest threat had just become neutralized.  They weren't in need of many advanced ships at the time and just stuck to slowly refitting existing models.  This would explain why the bulk of the ships seen early on in TNG are either older models (Excelsiors, Oberth) or clearly based on older tech (Constellation).  This would account for the abundance of Excelsior and Mirandas in the Dominion War.  The Federation clearly became complacent.  They were still creating some new designs but there wasn't much urgency until the Romulans came out of seclusion and, more specifically, the Borg threat.  The Federation was hit, hard, with a heavy dose of reality at Wolf 359.  This led to them quickly abandoning some of the newer classes (Ambassador, New Orleans, Freedom classes) which were possibly seen as slower, bulky and not well armed and started designing newer sleeker, low profile classes which could hang in a fight longer; Akira, Saber, Steamrunner, & Sovereign.  I left out Defiant because that ship was purpose-built for the Borg, while the other classes were completely shifting the Starfleet standards in ship design."
startrek,3cz6w1,ActionFlank,2,Sun Jul 12 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"TMP ships were constantly refitted to extend their operation life, Excelsior in particular.  She was just the right size to stay multimission capable for decades.  I'd say Ambassador was a stepping stone of technology, like beam arrays, but wasn't the clear jump in capability that the Galaxy provided."

That, coupled with being relatively easy to manufacture, would explain its long life.   The Ambassador could be compared more the the Constitution Class, they existed for a couple decades, but were replaced by ships that had longer lives, and could be upgraded easier. Like the Excelsior and Galaxy Classes.   It is a shame, since the Ambassador is one of my favorite ships, and the C is my favorite Enterprise."

Plus CBS has done roughly 50% of the franchise (7 TNG, 3 TOS, 4 ENT and the Movies 7 DS9 and 7 VOY remain - maybe TAS too), it makes sense for them to do the other half at some point for future proofing"

startrek,3cytwa,SciencePhysicist,2,Sun Jul 12 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"The Trek franchise has always been overpriced. Maybe they do that for a calculated business reason that we can't fathom. Perhaps by keeping the cost higher the shows don't get taken for granted as a result and there's a longstanding sustained demand that we're not aware of because we don't handle their books. However, they seemed really bitter that the TNG Sets on Blu-ray didn't sell to their satisfaction, which is why they told Rob Burnett they wouldn't be Remastering and redoing the effects for DS9 (which means forget ""Voyager"" automatically as well therefore ...not that I personally give a shit about that, because quite frankly, I don't). However, I didn't hear any complaints whatsoever about how the TOS Remastered Sets sold, which they also did a complete overhaul on ...and undertaking a project like that is also for the sake of posterity obviously. It would be nice if they would at least Remaster the DS9 film elements, and give the effects sequences a spit and polish at least even if they don't want to completely redo them, but I think the fact that they don't feel they can do that and then put them on Blu-ray is also a significant obstacle to at least seeing the live action scenes remastered from top to bottom.  Bottom line, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for DS9 to hit Blu-ray and HD, as shitty as that no doubt sounds to you."
startrek,3cytwa,StarFuryG7,2,Sun Jul 12 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"DS9 certainly has an extremely hardcore fan base, but (and please don't take this as a slight) it's probably quite small in the scheme of things. No HD/Blu-ray is purely a business decision.  Personally, I wasn't all that surprised TNG failed to sell as well as TOS. Although it's clearly made its mark  - and with lasting impact, the show just hasn't become the icon TOS has.  If anything, TOS is becoming even more culturally ingrained while TNG is perhaps slipping backwards in that respect. Overall, DS9 and VOY are nowhere in this picture I'm sad to say."
startrek,3cytwa,LOKAI_of_CHERON,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, there's nothing for me to be offended by in what you said, as I'm not a huge hardcore DS9 fan, although I do believe it had its standout episodes and moments that made it worthwhile, or at least somewhat so. I'm a fan of the original series first and foremost though, including of the later movies that featured that cast. My next favorite show if I had to pick one would be TNG, although I don't own it on either Blu-ray or DVD yet. I'll get it one day when I'm in a better position financially and the price is right, however. DS9 then falls next in line as far as my personal rankings goes, but there's frankly not enough strong episodes in that series to make buying it on home video a priority for me. Even TNG is a fifty-fifty or sixty-forty deal in terms of really worthwhile or decent episodes versus filler or those that are simply subpar or just not worth the bother.  But hey, TOS I have the original DVD releases of all three seasons: the Remastered versions also on Standard DVD, as well as Blu-ray, so it's obvious what I really love first and foremost out of the whole bunch. And I realize it may seem that those last two releases --Remastered on both DVD as well as Blu-ray-- may seem like overkill and perhaps even a waste of money, but the truth is, I never expected to buy the Remastered sets on Blu-ray once I had them on Standard DVD, which they were put out in first. However, Amazon had an offer on the Blu-ray Sets that I simply couldn't say no too. The deal was really that good. That's how I ended up with this series in both formats."
startrek,3cytwa,StarFuryG7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"Although it's less money for CBS, if their issue is finding the money to spend on putting any other Star Trek shows on blu-ray, just use the licensing fee they charge for any streaming services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc) and put the money into each show's remastering ""pot"".  That way they can get the remasters done, not pay for it completely out of their company stash, still provide Star Trek for fans, and when the remasters drop, renegotiate a deal with all these services to stream them in HD. Crazy money for CBS and Paramount and they basically recoup their money/make more money AND they don't take it ""off the air"" (from streaming) so they can still be getting a fan base ready for the remasters."

startrek,3cyae3,thisismyfist,2,Mon Jul 13 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"No, I think we're going to see a lot of battles with bridge crew perspectives. They were able to do that pretty dynamically in ""Prelude,"" but I get your concern, and you may be on to something. There may be more of what you're worried about in the film than either of us will care to deal with. I'm willing to keep an open mind about it for the time being though because this is just one short scene.   What bothers me is that they could have done another few takes of that scene for it to come across more convincingly.   I also think that's one of the major differences between a professional production and an amateur production though, because the professionals really know how to spot that kind of stuff and weed it out. This looks like the cut they're going to go with however, and so I see warning signs in various areas that I really wish weren't there."

startrek,3cyae3,AlphaFourOne,18,Sun Jul 12 03:57:46 2015 UTC,"That is a significant theme in Star Trek canon. And it bridges where Enterprise left off to this period in time. From Enterprise:   Vulcan Ambassador Soval: We don't know what to do about Humans. Of all the species we've made contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have the arrogance of Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One moment, you're as driven by your emotions as Klingons, and the next, you confound us by suddenly embracing logic.  Admiral Maxwell Forrest: I'm sure those qualities are found in every species.  Vulcan Ambassador Soval: Not in such confusing abundance.    It would seem they are trying to ensure that the story is consistent with canon as much as possible.  As far as technical oversights and errors - it is not a mega million dollar production. It is fan funded, and they need to work with what they can afford to get the entire project done, actors included. They are unlikely to do 30-40 takes to get it ""just right"", as that means paying actors and union more than they can budget.  I think so far they are doing pretty well when all factors are considered. I do have my ""nit-pics"" (the female vulcan is not quite convincing) but overall I have not been disappointed so far and look forward to the end result."

startrek,3cyae3,stylus2000,2,Sat Jul 11 23:37:47 2015 UTC,"This just highlights how poorly developed the other races are. Klingons are warrior people stereotypes, the Vulcans are all arrogant, intelligent and boring. The races are defined by a few stereotypes, usually with only one language, culture and one racial makeup, the quote points this out. Humans are not special, they are just the ones with actual development because we already know about humans. This is one area Star Trek could have done better.  It also borders on the real world issues Star Trek fought against. Like suggesting a race is better than another race then defining them by a few negative characteristics, while claiming yours is superior or special. I would be totally fine with less focus on humanity, and more alien development."

startrek,3cz8fb,theamericunt,2,Sun Jul 12 05:20:37 2015 UTC,"There are a few examples of Human/Federation counter culture throughout TNG/DS9/VOY. It's definitely not at the forefront of what those series are about, but it does exist, albeit in a somewhat superficial way. That was one of the main issues with those series that Ron Moore has talked about before. There was a little too much required structure to the world that disallowed the exploration of more complex and human issues. He's said that one of the most satisfying parts of moving from Trek to Battlestar Galactica was that he had that freedom to go dark in the search for more real issues of discontent. If he hadn't been ousted from VOY by Braga, I think it would have been a lot more like his re-imagined BSG and I think that would have made that series a lot better.  Anyway /rant over, here are the examples that I can think of off the top of my head:  You see several episodes that deal with pretty crummy federation colonies. There are those like where Tasha is from that are totally lawless, and there are some like the one in DS9 where they reject technology.  DS9 (as Ron Moore had the biggest hand in that series) does it the best with its episodes about the Maquis. Also, the episodes Homefront and Paradise Lost definitely demonstrate some of the issues with Earth's ""paradise"". There's also the episode with the terrorists on Risa and Worf sort of joining them.  I think there's a Voyager episode where the Doctor programs himself a little holo-family and when he tries to make it more realistic, the kids turn out to be assholes that embrace more counter-cultural elements.  Lastly, there's a couple of DS9 episodes that deal with ""The Orion Syndicate"" which is a vast and incredibly dangerous criminal organization that exists beneath the Federation radar.  I'd say the Orion Syndicate episodes, as well as the great Maquis episodes (all from DS9) are the best examples of what you're looking for."
