My guess is that Republicans told Democrats that if they voted for TPA, they would return the favor by voting for TAA, which would have been unlikely to pass without this kind of deal.  Source"
DiscussTheTPP,3bd4hm,soqqerbabe27,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't read that article because I don't want to subscribe or register..  The TAA sounds great but the effectiveness of it is low and very well documented over the years.    The effectiveness of the program in terms of mitigating earning losses in the new job is very low too as several studies report. Reynolds and Palatucci (2008) estimate that “participating in the TAA program causes a wage loss approximately 10 percentage points greater than if the displaced worker had chosen not to participate in the program.”  TAA participants worked about the same number of weeks but had lower earnings.  States receive funds at the beginning of the fiscal year but it does not properly reflect the state´s demand for training services. In addition, states do not receive funds for case management and lack flexibility to use the funds for training. Thus, states face challenges in providing services to workers properly. TAA   Why do they want the TAA if it is ineffective and there are other alternatives? It does appear to be protecting American workers on the surface of it and the talking points for it are beneficial to the party but in reality it doesn't seem to help workers at all."
DiscussTheTPP,3bd4hm,soqqerbabe27,3,Sun Jun 28 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, sorry about that. That article was really vague anyway. Basically, all it said was that Republicans were having a hard time passing the TAA/TPA combo, so they split it into two bills. And that this was a gamble because it would mean that Democrats would have to trust Republicans and had quotes from the Majority leaders saying that they intended to pursue both TPA and TAA.  That's another really good question. I mean why do politicians do anything that's inefficient? Corruption? Pandering to voters? Maybe House Democrats were worried that TPA might pass without any kind of assistance for workers who lose their jobs.   For what it's worth though, I think that the job loss that the TPP would cause wouldn't be the most important impact of the agreement. With NAFTA, U.S. job loss was really blown out of proportion source"

But this treaty gives the private entity that is disputing the government more abilities to abuse ISDS.    “If a Vietnamese company with U.S. operations wanted to challenge an increase in the U.S. minimum wage, it could use ISDS,” Warren wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in February. “But if an American labor union believed Vietnam was allowing Vietnamese companies to pay slave wages in violation of trade commitments, the union would have to make its case in the Vietnamese courts.”"

Take this paragraph for example   These investment rules mirror rights and protections in the United States and are designed to provide no greater substantive rights to foreign investors than are afforded under the Constitution and U.S. law.  For example, the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that no person shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”  The Fourteenth Amendment states that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  Several of these rights – such as those relating to expropriation and denial of justice – are also longstanding elements of customary international law protections for investors abroad.   If a domestic firm couldn't stop a minimum wage increase in domestic courts why would a foreign firm be able to?"

This part showed me that they are concerned with what I was talking about and are working on updating isds:   Much of the concern about ISDS is the risk of companies using the mechanism to challenge legitimate regulations.  Philip Morris International, for example, has challenged Australia’s plain packaging regulation under a 1993 Hong Kong-Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty.  Though that case has not yet been fully adjudicated and Australia has made no changes to their regulation, we nonetheless are working to ensure that TPP includes important safeguards that protect against ISDS being used to challenge legitimate regulation.  That is why the United States has put in place several layers of defenses to minimize the risk that U.S. agreements could be exploited in the manner to which other agreements among other countries are susceptible."

If the TPP is 12,000 pages long, it will take 13 days straight of average reading just to get through it. Add a day for each 1000 pages added.
