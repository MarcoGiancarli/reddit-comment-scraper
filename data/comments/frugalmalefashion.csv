frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,Leavemymarc,54,Tue Jul 21 16:44:17 2015 UTC,"As a watch enthusiast I want to share a few thoughts:   Orient is a brand with a long history in Japan. They are part owned by Seiko.  They have a reputation for being good value for money and are often recommended as solid ""first real watch"" purchases.  This is an automatic movement. It has no battery. It is powered by the movement of your wrist. This means that if you don't wear the watch for a few days, it will stop. Since this movement does not allow hand winding, you'll have to shake it and get it going again and then adjust the time.  Per my previous bullet, if pinpoint accuracy and ""set it and forget it"" convenience are important to you, this may not be the right choice for you. Automatic watches have some ""personality"" and are ""alive"" in a manner of speaking. They take care and maintenance and some attention to enjoy them fully. Think of them like calfskin shoes versus cheap leather throwaway shoes. You have to clean/polish those calfskin shoes, but they look/feel better and are of higher quality.  The styling of this model is slightly on the casual side. You could wear it with slacks and a dress shirt and it's a work appropriate watch, but I wouldn't recommend this with a suit or for formal occasions. It's not a true dress watch.  Size wise, this will look fine on wrists from about 6.75""-8.5"" in circumference. If you have wrists that fall outside of the fat part of the wrist size bell curve, this may not be for you. For the majority of us, this watch is a pretty acceptable size. It's not huge like many trendy watches and it's not tiny like a lot of vintage models. Just right.  There is a huge aftermarket for bracelets and bands that can go on this piece, so you can customize the strap/bracelet to your hearts content. Just get the width right."
frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,Rhett_Rick,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"I recently got a starter automatic watch as well.. I am finding that the self-winding mechanism doesn't last 24 hours, and I most likely have to reset the time if I don't wear the watch every day. Is this normal? Your post seem to indicate they may last more than 24 hours without needing to be wound.."
frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,ieatfrosties,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:35 2015 UTC,probably because you didn't fully wound your watch. Buy a watch winder so you don't have to reset/wear your watch all the time.
frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,long218,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:13 2015 UTC,So is it often that automatic watch wearers find that their watch dies in less than 24 hours if they don't wind it fully/stay overly active?
frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,ieatfrosties,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"Depend on your jobs. If you sitting at your cubicle most of the day, you probably won't wind it to its maximum."
frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,long218,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"What do you do during the day? Commute to school and sit in class? Sit at a desk all day at work? It's possible you're just not moving enough to wind up the watch. It could also be the movement. What watch is it?  Watch winders are certainly a solution but they're not necessary. If it can be handwound, you can handwind it to build up the power reserve. If if does not, you can 'swirl' it around to wind it via the rotor."
frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,Citizen_V,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:43 2015 UTC,"I fully swirl it and wear it.

One thing you can test is your power reserve. Fully handwind it (around 40 winds), leave it in a table and record how long it lasts.   EDIT: Just to double check, which way do you swirl it? It has unidirectional winding (counterclockwise), so if it's going in the other direction, it's actually not winding it. Sorry, if you already knew this."

frugalmalefashion,3e37nv,Playstyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"I realize your question was directed to someone else, but if you have the money, spring for the SARB033/035. More scratch-resistant crystal, higher-tier movement. Fit and finish of the SARB series is among the best at the ~$300 price point.  The Defender is a great watch in it's own right, but I would front the additional cost for something a little higher quality. Style is a consideration here too. Tactical/casual versus dressy."

I've been looking at these as a less expensive alternative to AE Daltons, but from my research, it seems these are made in India with leather of lower-quality. On eBay, it looks like used pairs don't crease too well, but that's not the greatest indicator. Still looks like a great deal though."

frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,CeJeH,2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:25 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen it in person, but keep in mind this is a very casual jacket.

frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,r_slash,4,Tue Jul 21 18:35:49 2015 UTC,CM quality is on par with J Crew and BR. Pre good starting blazer
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,FiletMcShay,9,Tue Jul 21 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"CM quality is on par with J Crew and BR   Highly disagree with that sentiment. J Crew blazers have at least a passable half-canvass and much more robust fabrics (100% super 120's wool) than either BR or CM. These are a cotton-poly blend and fused. Sure, J Crew may not be worth $500 like MSRP but it is easily a leg above your average department store or fast-fashion merchandiser.  EDIT: Honestly I'm not a huge fan of how J Crew cuts their blazers, far to slim and short for me, I'm just making a point having owned in both areas here. This is a completely different blazer, not bad for a beginner or beater garment, but unfortunately not built to last and priced as such."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:17 2015 UTC,"J Crew fans are pretty overzealous at times, but in many cases, such as this one, they are not wrong. :) still, I think this is very good for the price don't you? A decent entry level blazer for a frugal guy?"
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really not a huge J Crew fan anymore, but I definitely had a phase! I'm just a canvass-evangelist (say that 3 times fast). Yes, definitely a good deal for an entry-level blazer, or just a beater. I always have a few knock-arounds for when I know I'm going to be around booze and need to look presentable. I just don't find it fair comparing a fused, wool blended blazer with a canvassed one made of super 120's wool."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,nancy_ballosky,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:50 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining the benefit of canvas if its not too much trouble? I dont have any experience with blazers.
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"Sure! It's actually spelled ""canvass"", and this article can explain it much better than me.  For the sparknotes, essentially a canvassed blazer is constructed by sewing a layer of special material (normally woven horse or camel hair) between the outer fabric and inner lining. This secures all the layers together thoroughly and protects the shape of the blazer over time. Have you ever had a garment lose shape as it ages? A fused suit mostly lose quality over its lifespan. A canvassed jacket will form to your body shape over time, like the way a good leather shoe breaks in. Additionally, it will have a much more robust drape and sit cleaner on the shoulders."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Davin900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:25 2015 UTC,Where do you typically look for canvassed blazers?
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"Depends. Many retailers carry them. What are you looking for specifically? A common suggestion around here is SuitSupply, it isn't quite the cheapest but is definitely one of the best values and has a pretty safe styling between the really modern slim cuts and baggier traditional cuts."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Davin900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:46 2015 UTC,I like the look of the CM herringbone blazer I mentioned elsewhere. I don't know. I have a corduroy blazer from Freeman's that I like a lot. Interesting patterns and materials are something I like a lot.
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,SuperXISM,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"CM Made In USA are similar to J. Crew. Crew often sources above average fabrics from Italy and the UK but the prices they MSRP don't make it worth what's always a Made in China suit. I find Crew to also fit too long for me, I'm 5' 8"" and have found 38S to still be too long. Contrarily, CM MIUSA are on brink of too short, might have to size up for it being very trim fitting."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"CM Made In USA are similar to J. Crew   In what ways? The cut is different (as you noted), the assembly is on completely different ends of the spectrum (fused vs. canvass), and like you mentioned again J Crew has exceptional fabric sourcing. I find their cuts to be far too Thom Browne-esque so I don't wear them and yes, it is overpriced at MSRP, but we're talking two completely different types of blazer here. Buying J Crew at MSRP is totally silly, although at ~30% they are a good buy and at a much higher level than your average blazer.  I understand why people want MIUSA, but for manufactured garments like J Crew, CM, BR, etc, it mainly boils down to an ethical decision. Factories in America don't automatically stitch straighter or cut uniform."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,SuperXISM,0,Tue Jul 21 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"I should've been more specific. Yes, cuts are way different. Construction is similar though I can't say if CM uses canvass (none of my MIUSA ones have it). Quality is similar though Crew often uses italian mills to hike their desirability as much as CM uses MIUSA to lure that demo. Bothers me that everything is constructed in China for Crew and how much they expect people to pay for it. I also am just sick of overbody oozing over the Ludlow cut because it's not a great cut at all -- it's perfect if you're 6' 4"" but the button stance and deep V don't look right on many average/shorter men."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:19 2015 UTC,"I said in my OP that I too don't love the Ludlow cut. I like BB Milano the best for my body shape.   Crew often uses italian mills to hike their desirability as much as CM uses MIUSA to lure that demo   These are completely different. Huge, huge, huge difference. What would a bespoke Saville Row suit be if they used cotton-poly? Likewise one of the biggest reasons J Crew's suits hold water in the professional world and these don't is because of the material."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,SuperXISM,0,Tue Jul 21 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"Only difference is CM doesn't boast their material sources. I have three and the quality is seemingly very good. Sometimes, it's just a name. People spooge over MIUSA as much as 'it came from an Italian mill'. Italians produce cheaper end fabrics too because Italy holds an imperial status in the fashion world -- I've seen such Italian milled label suits at H&M before, proudly labeled.  Crew has poly blends just like any other clothier. A canvassed suit doesn't guarantee a great looking suit if it doesn't fit/tailored right for the end wearer."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Starving_Kids,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"Only difference is CM doesn't boast their material sources.   What are you even talking about? They use a poly blend. HUGE difference to a super 120's wool, no matter where you source it. It's not a matter of splooging over it. Hell I don't personally wear either of them but have handled both and the difference in build quality is enormous. Are you trying to justify your purchase here? These CM blazers are fine for the price. You get what you pay for.   Italians produce cheaper end fabrics too because Italy holds an imperial status in the fashion world   Yes that happens. And Loro Piana (J Crew's source) also happens to supply fabrics to a huge variety of retailers. However the phrase I've said about 30 times now, Super 120's, is a physical measurement of quality based on the microns of thickness in the fabric. It's like the load bearing of a chain or density of a metal, a physical property that measure thickness of fabric and quality. You don't seem to have any idea what you're talking about here.   I've seen such Italian milled label suits at H&M before, proudly labeled   Find me a suit at H&m with 100% italian sourced wool, super 120's+, and I will eat my shoe on video for you.   Crew has poly blends just like any other clothier   Find me a suit from J Crew (not factory) that is made with a poly blend, excluding the weather-proof lines they made for women a while ago, and I will eat my other shoe on camera for you.   A canvassed suit doesn't guarantee a great looking suit if it doesn't fit/tailored right for the end wearer   Of course it doesn't. I never made that assertion. But a fused suit that is tailored will lose shape over time while the canvassed does not; therefore quality over time goes to the canvassed suit.  Serious question, are you trolling? There is zero competition between fused and canvassed suits, money aside. A fused suit will last just fine for most people, and is very cheap. When you need to buy a suit to wear multiple times/week and have money to spend, the canvassed suit is the higher quality choice. A Ferrarri goes faster than a Civic, but most people don't need Ferrarris."

frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,SuperXISM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:05 2015 UTC,Caliente Fuego
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,thelastbaron,2,Tue Jul 21 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's nuts. Incredible find. They had a light check Lardini for $1,200, last I saw it was marked down to $699 without the additional discounts."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,glyoung,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"This looks like a really good sale, but how's the brand? Are these actually normally worth $400? I'll have to double check my size and hope it's one of the ones available."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,glyoung,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy it at $400.  It's fused and cotton blend.
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,vna_prodigy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"I would not buy at $400 either, but at close to $60 you can tailor the hell out of it and still have a great value. It may not be the nicest but it is great for the price. An affordable wardrobe builder. Frugal male fashion. Just note that the sleeve buttons appear functional so if you have short arms like me tailoring could get pricey."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,smegmasphere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"Yea you can't really go wrong at the discounted price, but also don't expect the quality to be great even with the MSRP of $400."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,vna_prodigy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:13 2015 UTC,I don't know much about blazers. Can anyone share some tips about what to look for?
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Davin900,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"Ideally a low button stance will narrow your waist and broaden your shoulders by creating a V. I prefer unlined or partially lined because I live in a warm climate and need breathability, cotton lining is better than synthetic for that but if it is for cold weather it doesn't matter as much. Fused lining does not move as well with your body as a stitched lining.  Make sure it fits in the shoulders, but expect a trip to the tailor to fix the waist and sleeves. Nonfunctional buttons on the sleeves are easier to tailor (cheaper) so if you have short arms, know that. A close fitting blazer is most fashionable. Match tie width to lapel width.  If you have no blazers, start with navy because it matches everything. I hope those tips help a bit!"
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Davin900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!  The Wright Dobby Blazer sizes without S/R/L. What size is it without S/R/L?
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,pantherhare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"They do, thanks! I've always liked blazers, and could use some being a graduate student, but could never afford any, so I have literally zero experience with them. I would prefer more casual blazers than formal ones - any tips on that kind of style?"
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,tripletruble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:18 2015 UTC,What do people think of this herringbone blazer?  http://www.clubmonaco.com/product/index.jsp?productId=35090156&prodFindSrc=search
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,ohsemantics,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"I like it. The polyester lining and heavy tweed make it more of a cold weather jacket but it looks sharp. It has two buttons so it is going to look best on a taller fella. If you are 5'8"" or shorter you may be best to look for one button."
frugalmalefashion,3e1umu,Macho561,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:36 2015 UTC,I'm 6' so it should work. Hopefully their sizing is similar to other brands...
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,propagated,16,Tue Jul 21 13:15:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love that Strandmok @ $196.90.  Having bought 6 pairs of Allen Edmonds already this year, though, I'm trying to resist the urge to buy another."
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,sandy_lyles_bagpipes,6,Tue Jul 21 13:30:29 2015 UTC,I'm laughing at how people are down voting you for buying too many pairs of shoes. How dare you have that much money!
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,DE0XYRIBONUCLEICACID,7,Tue Jul 21 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"It's not always about price or a good deal. When I first started to buy expensive dress shoes for work (3 years ago), I bought a ton of AE shoes (10-15) in a very short span of time. Now I have a pair of black strands, walnut park avenues, brown quintons, black delrays, brown RL penny loafers, and neumoks sitting around collecting dust. I definitely have less than 100 wears between the 6.  Just because it's a good value on sale, doesn't mean that you're going to wear it enough to warrant the cost. And to be honest, these strandmoks look terrible. They're quasi-distressed, balmoral, vibram soled, and are made of what looks like calf leather. It's a terrible casual shoe and an even worse formal shoe. The only thing that this pair has over the regular walnut strands is the vibram sole for casual wear. The suede strandmoks though, those were nice.   Take the time to work shoes into your rotation before you go crazy buying stuff just because it's on sale. Try some other brands, other lasts, and other styles. Brands like Carmina, Viberg, and Alden put AE to shame. Just because something from AE is on sale, doesn't make it a good buy.  I wish that I just bought a nice pair of shell aldens/carminas/trickers. But I'm stuck with several pairs of AE that I won't ever wear because I wasn't great at working formal dress shoes into an outfit."

frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,CWSwapigans,3,Tue Jul 21 17:28:32 2015 UTC,Seems pretty hasty to buy 6 pairs in half a year :o
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,marfin20,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"Allen Edmonds are good, if not great shoes at a reasonable price, but c'mon man...6 in 7 months? Diversify, time stagger, and wait to see how they break in for you. Nobody needs that many new shoes over such a short period."
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,tim262729,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"I bought 3 pair this week...  Granted, job change and I needed dress shoes"
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,Nashgoth,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"In the true sense of the word ""need"", none of us ever need any shoes that cost more than $30.  I respect your right to buy things for yourself as you see fit; perhaps you should adopt a similar attitude towards others."
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,sandy_lyles_bagpipes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"That is great! I have around 12 pairs of Allen Edmonds that I bought in the last 6 months. I would wait to see how they break in because I have 3 pairs that are ""D"" width but found out my true width is ""E"" and now I cannot use them more than a couple of hours :(  To the people down voting you: Everyone has a different budget and priorities. Some people would spend 200USD+ during a weekend partying/eating/drinking, other people would prefer to save the money and buy premium shoes :)"
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,Latin_MIT,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"I spend a lot of money on drinking, too.  Anyway, I just re-counted, and I've bought five (5) pairs of AEs this year, not 6 as originally-written.  I've purchased:  Patriot (second quality) Cambridge (shell cordovan, used on eBay) Hancock (second quality) Jefferson (second quality) Franciscan (second quality)  So, out of the lot, I have a penny loafer, two wingtips, one cap toe, and one monkstrap.  They range from walnut to dark brown.  This, for me, has been enough diversification to warrant each purchase, given that my prior non-sneaker collection consisted of renewing a pair of brown and a pair of black square-toe POS shoes from Marshall's, typically in the $20 range per pair.  I've been on a shoe-buying binge, because I'm refreshing my wardrobe this year and hope to not buy any new clothes or shoes for another 5 years.  Also, this."

frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,ooprab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:55 2015 UTC,Wish they had the Park Aves in Walnut. The Strands are too formal for me
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,Chippo,14,Tue Jul 21 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"You mean that the Strands are too informal, right? Because Park Aves are much more formal than the Strands."
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,Great_Platypus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, i read somewhere the busier it is, the more formal it is? I might be mistaken. Would you say that the strands are more flexible with outfits?"
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,Chippo,9,Tue Jul 21 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite. Stands will be more casual. Think about what shoes are paired with tuxedos or formal military events. Highly polished black Oxford. I really like the strands. Owning both park avenues and strands I'd say I wear my stands more by a factor of 2:1.  But my dress code is very casual.   Also owning a pair of McTavish, I feel the stand is the perfect middle ground b/w the other two pairs."
frugalmalefashion,3e2gp3,arm5y7,4,Tue Jul 21 14:41:52 2015 UTC,By far. Broguing makes a shoe more casual. Suede brogues are the most versatile shoe during the summer/spring.

frugalmalefashion,3dyk3f,guilka,13,Mon Jul 20 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"Groupon started out much like Massdrop. Basically, 100 or so people would all get together and agree to buy something in bulk, so they can get the rebaited bulk price.  Then, people started to use the platform just to sell their stuff. So they'd make a ""goal"" of like 15 people, which would ALWAYS hit. It sort of defeated the purpose.  That's what MassDrop is doing now. The ""goals"" are tiny, so it is almost guaranteed to hit."

frugalmalefashion,3dyk3f,ashkpa,12,Mon Jul 20 20:45:23 2015 UTC,"Because they are pointless, and missing the entire reason why these programs exist to begin with. They aren't selling it at the bulk discounted rate. Rather, they are selling it at the normal rate claiming you're getting the bulk discount rate.  It's what ruined Groupon. Groupon is now just a place people sell their stuff on like any other platform, under the false guise that you're getting some huge deal, when you really aren't.  Kickstarter has a similar problem with people using the platform, not to raise money by bootstrapping, but instead to just set up a bunch of presales of a product they already have funded. They are using the platforms to market their product, rather than use the platform as intended."

I got Rivieras for $25, and they were normally for $105.  You had people buying literally 10 Vitamix blenders cause they were coming out at like $300 (but I'm pretty sure all those orders got cancelled; it was a shitshow of cancelled orders days after).  They also had 1000 miles on clearance for pretty good prices around then too."

So as far as I'm concerned, they are easily the best value boat shoe or boat loafer on the market. Leather quality is excellent, the aesthetics are beautiful, and all for price point roughly half of what you would pay for other brands like Rancourt, Quoddy, or OSB.   I own a couple pairs, and would definitely recommend them over Sperry, Sperry Gold Cup, etc.   Edit:  they are discontinuing the other colors, including dark brown, green, and red. Those colors are $117, but limited to whatever sizes are left."

frugalmalefashion,3dunk6,bunsandbunnies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:33:38 2015 UTC,Golden brown. I think lighter leather looks better with summer outfits.

frugalmalefashion,3dunk6,bunsandbunnies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:50:02 2015 UTC,Does the leather look significantly better on the AE? The reason why I want to pay the extra money for the AE is because sperries look almost plastic to me (and I was hoping that it was because of the leather quality).

frugalmalefashion,3dunk6,JohnnyVNCR,3,Sun Jul 19 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"They seem to fit pretty close to true to size.  I wear a 9E in most AE shoes.  I went with an 8.5E in these since I wear them without socks.  I tried the 9E and it felt good, but maybe a hair loose, and these are CXL so the leather will probably stretch a bit with time.  The 8.5E feels nearly perfect, but maybe a hair snug.  The pair of brown Maritimes I have that I wear the most are already feeling pretty much perfect.  For reference, I own a pair of Sperry A/Os but they're 9.5E.  I put a terry cloth insole in them but they're still loose.  A 9E in the Sperrys with the insole would probably be perfect.  I also own a pair of Sperry Gold Cup beefroll penny loafers in 9D (they don't come in E).  Length is good but a bit narrow, 9E would probably be perfect.  Over on Styleforum, the consensus seems to be ~true to size or maybe size down a half size.  Probably wouldn't size down if you're going to wear insoles/liners.  To summarize: for me, I'd say I border between the same as my Sperry size/width, and maybe a 1/2 size smaller.  YMMV."

frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,tsxboy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:25 2015 UTC,are any of the polos really worth it?
frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,abcolly,4,Sun Jul 19 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"Depends. As always, you dress for a situation, and the pony is more about a status symbol than a fashion statement. It tells people about you in a way that few other brands do, and it provides a specific message about who you are. If the lifestyle associated with PRL doesn't fit you, then there's no reason to buy one."
frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,klethra,6,Sun Jul 19 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"I think that PRL polos are solid buys in the 30-40 range if we're concerned with solely their quality. In comparison to J Crew/BR polo shirts, PRL polos have a much more appealing collar roll (i.e. its collar holds up better, it's not as flat -- keep in mind that collar roll doesn't mean popping the collar).  Of course, Kent Wang does polo collars best. But, his shirts cost at least $70 new ($65 base + $5 shipping -- no sales).   A lot of people are turned-off by their logos, but I personally don't care too much if it's just a small pony (big ponies should typically be avoided though). The shirts come in a variety of colors (some less offensive/audacious than the others). Buying a navy polo w/ a small pony is pretty inoffensive."
frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,mdzjdz,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"At under $50 they are a good buy.   They are definitely higher quality than BB, j crew, BR, and lacoste"
frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,Wiggerkid,4,Sun Jul 19 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"You are smoking something if you think they are better than BB golden fleece.  I have had plenty of both, the BB dyes never fade and the material/weave stays so crisp and fresh.  Polo is great quality but not that tier."
frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,phialphagangster,3,Sun Jul 19 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"I own ones from BB golden fleece, PRL, lands end, and uniqlo.   The bb material is nice but the quality of stitching and construction is no better than lands end or uniqlo, PRL wins by a significant amount in this category.  You can't really compare the material of BB and PRL very easily, they are pretty different but both nice."
frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,Wiggerkid,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"I have all four of those as well as Fred Perry and Lacoste.  There is a reason I continue to buy BB.  The knit of material is better and I lived in the carribean for two years where I air/sun dried all my clothing.  My polos all took a beating, the only ones whose dyes did not fade were the BB. Edit--BB ones were also the only ones that did not get fuzzy."

frugalmalefashion,3du2o4,nydjason,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:44 2015 UTC,Slim fit fits very very slim. Custom is like a regular slim fit in most brands. Classic is a looser fit.

frugalmalefashion,3durlb,congratsonthesex,3,Sun Jul 19 17:55:40 2015 UTC,I'm surprised at how small the market for ties has become. It seems now only people who have to wear them do so. Gently worn second hand ties have become so cheap as result of the decrease in demand. High end ties can be had for a small fraction of the original price.
frugalmalefashion,3durlb,Whiteberry,3,Mon Jul 20 00:51:17 2015 UTC,Best place to find slimmer (2.5-3 inch) ties that are high quality? What brands do u recommend?
frugalmalefashion,3durlb,HungryHippo44,3,Mon Jul 20 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"I recommend looking at eBay first of all or styleforum where sellers typically sell large lots of ties which not many people will usually bid on. Another great place to go is either a goodwill in a nice area or a consignment store. You can find some amazing deals and many of the ties are like new.   If you must buy new you can find deals at Marshalls, TJ Maxx for brands like Brooks Brothers or look at other stores online that are having clearances like Barney's Warehouse or Yoox.   Here is a hierarchy of ties I found on Askandy and refer to: http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?65773-Best-Quality-Tie-Brands  Once you get a feel for quality ties you will be able to distinguish the silver from the dross."

frugalmalefashion,3durlb,akaghi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"I have to wear a tie to work every day.  I'm a sort of technician who has to wear a suit.  $39 for a tie is too much considering I'm often around Velcro and other tie hazards that make me go through ties faster than the average bro.  A tie for me is mostly about design, and not feel or durability.  I have 1 or two nice ties and the only difference between those and the cheap ones is a bit heavier of a feel.  Most people do not go through ties like I do... But that still doesn't change much.  You either like the design or not and unfortunately it doesn't seem to correspond with how much you pay for it."
frugalmalefashion,3durlb,Spaced_Inv8r,2,Mon Jul 20 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"A good tie is more about materials, drape, and structure. They will tie better, relax and spring back better, and make a better knot.  Doesn't mean you need a Sam Hober tie.

frugalmalefashion,3dv24m,eagleshark,3,Sun Jul 19 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"One of the great things about f21 is they have very exact measurements of each item online (although only numbers for size medium, but you can use that for comparison).  They carry clothes designed for skinny, normal, and baggy-fit fashion trends, so you really have to look at the numbers on each thing to see what your getting.  For example they have 2 similar grey bombers right now and one is much smaller than the other."

frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,hemifieldsofgreen,17,Sat Jul 18 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"These are nice jeans, especially at that price. I own two pairs, and they are my current favorite denim. The denim is very soft, much softer than my two pairs of Cone denim. They are ""raw"" in the sense that they are indigo dyed, and haven't been heavily washed, pre-distressed, or treated to prevent fading, but not 'pulled from the loom, touched once by a Japanese man wearing white gloves, and then slipped into a shipping box' raw. But more like traditional raw denim than like mass-market jeans, for sure.  They are gently washed once and are sanforized. Mine are indeed fading nicely, though the lines aren't as crisp as stiffer denim. Feels really great though - incredibly comfortable. Not selvedge, but clearly a nice denim with good hand. The jeans themselves have nice finishing touches, like the flat-head rivets. Mauro at WvG is a real fabric nerd, it is one of the nice things about all WvG stuff - interesting and quality fabric choices.  One very important thing about these is that they run true to size - NOT vanity! Look at the measurements, compare to an existing pair of pants that fit the way you like. I wear a 30 in nearly all major brands, and a 32 in these."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,phidauex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:44:46 2015 UTC,Can you post up your fades?
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,RedSeed,6,Mon Jul 20 16:25:56 2015 UTC,They were running some sort of competition in May with these jeans.  Loads of pictures and discussion in the styleforum thread: http://www.styleforum.net/t/478492/the-2015-2016-wolf-vs-goat-denim-contest-join-by-5-31
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,robomace,5,Sun Jul 19 00:32:07 2015 UTC,Are these raws? What's the quality like in these
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,wilsonhhuang,8,Sat Jul 18 22:21:56 2015 UTC,I can only vouch for their shirts but they're excellent quality. And Mauro (the guy behind wolf vs goat) is a great guy. Customer service is exceptional.
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,BramaLlama,6,Sat Jul 18 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"They are not raws. I'm too lazy to find the SF post, but when making them he said that he doesn't really care about the raw denim thing and was just looking for really nice soft denim."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,NotClever,2,Sun Jul 19 02:23:55 2015 UTC,More info here: http://www.wolfvsgoat.com/blogs/blog/17530937-denim-project-italy  Edit: They don't explicitly say it but I think they may be.
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,CharlesThe1337,2,Sat Jul 18 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"I think they were washed once to soften it up or something. They definitely will fade though, he even started a fade contest. I bought two pair because I was iffy on sizing, and both have tags warning about indigo transfer. The tag itself picked up quite a bit of indigo after wearing my pair for a week or so. The construction is really good too. I think they were made in Italy or something. The suede patch is a nice detail, I'm hoping it ages well."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,ZoidbergTheThird,2,Sun Jul 19 03:34:29 2015 UTC,"Raw doesn't have a true definition, so it's hard to say.  They are sanforized, so they aren't going to shrink significantly in water. They aren't selvedge. However, they could still be prone to crocking; I've never handled them so I can't say for sure."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,refinery,2,Sat Jul 18 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"I own a pair of these in 33/31. I am typically a 30 in Levi's 522. These definitely shrink about an inch in the waist after a wash AND dry. I needed the shrink anyways, so now it fits like a Levi's 30 now. These are NOT selvedge but are very nice quality and in my opinion, worth the $55."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,Ketchupboi,3,Sun Jul 19 00:42:14 2015 UTC,"I bought these last time around, and definitely recommend copping a pair for this price. I love mine."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,figwitfan,3,Sun Jul 19 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"These are great. For reference, I usually wear a 29 or 30 in vanity sized pants (J. Crew, Gap, other mall tier brands) and I wear a 31 in these. These are definitely true to waist size, so make sure to look at the measurements.  The construction on these is pretty great, better than my Naked and Famous denim. Tucked belt loops, reinforced buttons, good bar tacking."
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,tripletruble,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:14 2015 UTC,Is it just me or do the pictures show two distinct shades of denim in the picture? Any sense of sense of which picture is most accurate?
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,RedSeed,4,Sat Jul 18 23:37:31 2015 UTC,They are probably the same shade; it's the lighting that makes  it look like different shades.   I would recommend you to take a picture of one of your indigo denim with flash to see how lighting can affect pictures of denim.  tldr: probably looks like the dark one irl
frugalmalefashion,3ds17o,d4nimal,2,Sun Jul 19 01:39:11 2015 UTC,These are final sale.  Get your size right (not vanity) - a lot of people mess this up.

frugalmalefashion,3drepk,cobaltorange,0,Sun Jul 19 05:54:46 2015 UTC,"Nah some are do work and look good but I think high tops chunky looking sneakers seem to look best on dark skinned/asian heritage people.   I'm not trying to be racist or anything it just doesn't gel with me sort of like when you see the outfits white rappers like Eminem wear, it's a good effort but he doesn't pull it off well IMO as his heritage isn't the same. Picutre a white guy wearing an African dashiki shirt, worn for effect in certain situations looks good but if it becomes a white surburban american man's daily dress it looks a bit weird.  edit: maybe try telling me how I'm wrong instead of doing the internet equivalent of crying and saying ""you're wrong because I like this and it hurts my feelings that you don't"" guys."

frugalmalefashion,3drepk,onefeelplease,2,Sun Jul 19 08:10:18 2015 UTC,"(Sorry about the length here, have to love night shifts)  Gotta be honest, I was ready to downvote you the second you made a statement that races had assigned, compartmentalized clothing rules.  Then I read your follow-up comment. I'm not sure I 100% understand your side of this viewpoint (specifically concerning sneakers as relating to black, or non-white culture), but as you said it's your own opinion and I do think I see where you're coming from.  I realized that I may be guilty of hypocrisy for instantly thinking you're a dumb-dumb in comparison to my own thoughts on the issue of race/culture-appropriate apparel. I certainly think it's ridiculous when whites wear headdresses in the face of Native American protests, for example.  Maybe that's where I feel there's a difference between our thoughts? I believe I can see a cultural, spiritual connection with an article of clothing and it's appropriation and misuse. I don't have that same thought when it comes to sneakers on any race, but I can honestly say I've never given it thought to begin with. Even the example you brought up, the Dashiki shirt- I know next to nothing about it, yet I would instantly say it carries more cultural weight than the ""chunkiness"" of a shoe in relation to the skin tone of the owner. Again though, I haven't thought about this before, I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong.  Now's about the time that I'd like to address an obvious point: Christ, you just wanted to (I'm assuming) discuss outfit silhouettes and how they look on people, when this fukken keyboard activist wrote a comment inspired by Hawthorne. No one is more sorry about that than me, but I actually think you brought up a great discussion. It'd be a shame to not be recognized.  Maybe it is more visually pleasing when certain people wear particular items. Maybe there's nothing wrong with that; it definitely sounds malice-free when typed out like that.   I am curious though, would you mind elaborating on when you mentioned that Eminem doesn't always pull of an outfit because his heritage isn't the same as those who typically wear those clothes? What prevents him from belonging to that culture and heritage, even though his public image and success arguably prove that he is accepted as such? Would it be fair to say that he has owned that look for so long that he genuinely is part of that culture? Is heritage mutually exclusive to the place people grow up in or the experiences that affect a person/peoples?   These aren't questions designed to trap or antagonize you, again I think you just brought up a good discussion and wanted to expand it :)"
frugalmalefashion,3drepk,Ishtuk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:40:55 2015 UTC,"(Sorry about the length here, have to love night shifts)   No problems, I respect you for being the only one to get back to me on why you don't agree.   Gotta be honest, I was ready to downvote you the second you made a statement that races had assigned, compartmentalized clothing rules.   I don't want to generalise like that at all, I was admittedly a bit heavy handed.   Maybe that's where I feel there's a difference between our thoughts? I believe I can see a cultural, spiritual connection with an article of clothing and it's appropriation and misuse. I don't have that same thought when it comes to sneakers on any race, but I can honestly say I've never given it thought to begin with.    I was kind of stupid to bring in races as from what I've seen a big percentage of men were wearing chunky sneakers in the 80s (I was a baby toward the end so I never saw it in person) anyway.    Even the example you brought up, the Dashiki shirt- I know next to nothing about it, yet I would instantly say it carries more cultural weight than the ""chunkiness"" of a shoe in relation to the skin tone of the owner. Again though, I haven't thought about this before, I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong.   Yeah you're right, I was just heavy handed. It might just be my mind that completely dislikes the sneaker look. Maybe I have prejudices I need to sort out with social groups.   The thing is I've always felt like I have to be really masculine, like it's my duty or something and looked down on people in more street wear which is where most sneakers fall. I'm just so afraid of being perceived as a non-useful person I guess I want to be dressed and ready to help someone out with hard labour without being afraid of damaging my shoes (which is why I go boots) at all times. And because I'm white (with a Sicilian look because of my heritage) I guess I'm more likely to judge the guys in my racial group because I assume they're like me subconsciously... who knows.   Now's about the time that I'd like to address an obvious point: Christ, you just wanted to (I'm assuming) discuss outfit silhouettes and how they look on people, when this fukken keyboard activist wrote a comment inspired by Hawthorne.

Maybe there's nothing wrong with that; it definitely sounds malice-free when typed out like that.   I certainly think this is the case, dark skinned males seem to pull off the outrageous colours so much better than light skinned people. It's just the contrast it makes it pop so much, I love seeing dark skinned guys in purple button up shirts and similar, they rock it.   I am curious though, would you mind elaborating on when you mentioned that Eminem doesn't always pull of an outfit because his heritage isn't the same as those who typically wear those clothes? What prevents him from belonging to that culture and heritage, even though his public image and success arguably prove that he is accepted as such? Would it be fair to say that he has owned that look for so long that he genuinely is part of that culture? Is heritage mutually exclusive to the place people grow up in or the experiences that affect a person/peoples?   I can't really explain but when I see him looking like this:  http://i.imgur.com/sTu9lJz.jpg  I kind of think well it would work on the wu-tang clan but you look a bit silly Eminem. I guess one way to think of it (albiet an over the top example) is by thinking of a clown, why do we think clowns look funny? like why are those specific items linked to clowns? (ie long red shoes, baggy spotty overalls and bright red/green/blue hair), I've seen other people wear clothing that's similar in design and not look silly. I guess sometimes an outfit just makes you look like a clown and I think eminem looks like a clown in the above picture. It might not even be anything to do with his racial heritage after all."

frugalmalefashion,3drhv7,bzdelta,2,Sat Jul 18 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"Front of the sole ripped, I superglued it back, it's been okay. Threw some maroon polish and three insoles in and it's a serviceable beater."

frugalmalefashion,3drhv7,YuNaNiMus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:10:31 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up to anyone interested in these - they run quite large. I'm a Brannock 8-8.5 and was swimming in a size 8. 7 would've been best.  That being said, they'd probably be a decent beater boot."
frugalmalefashion,3drhv7,HeyJustWantedToSay,3,Sat Jul 18 19:41:28 2015 UTC,Cement constructed... Was hoping for a Goodyear welt like the golden fox from a few months ago. Still a decent buy.

frugalmalefashion,3drhv7,Only_Sona,2,Sat Jul 18 19:43:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this! I've been looking for a beater pair of boots for a while ever since the sole of this extremely cheap pair of beater boots I bought from H&M came clean off. Can't wait for them to come in!

frugalmalefashion,3drhv7,Sweetredpot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:00 2015 UTC,The side of the boots have horrible stripe mark on the leather...at least on the one I got a year ago.
frugalmalefashion,3drhv7,kingnook,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:28:50 2015 UTC,"I was also one of the people who got the $0 + $19.99 S&H deal last year.  After adding some shoe polish to change the color, the boots improved in look dramatically. They were never going to look like a $300 pair of boots--though some stranger once complimented my ""sweet Iron Rangers""--but they're decent enough in shape and design.   They've also held up pretty well with moderate usage (~40 wears in forests for photoshoots), and because they're beaters, I never have to worry about them in rain/water situations.  At ~$40, I'd say this is still a pretty good pair of boots to own, so I went ahead and placed an order for a second pair that I'll polish black."

frugalmalefashion,3dpgfa,SimmSalaBim,3,Sun Jul 19 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd agree with you.  I've had several pair of Gap selvedge over the past few years, and they'll take forever to fade (although they will eventually).  HOWEVER, I have a more recent pair of these Kaiharas, and they're showing pretty clear signs of fading at the creases after ~10 wears.

Additionally, they are quite small around the calves -- I sometimes have to pull mine down around my ankles after standing up from a seat.

frugalmalefashion,3dnhak,CookieDough,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:31:21 2015 UTC,This are shorter than any other brand of chino I've tried. I have 33x32 in about 5 different brands (all slim/tapered).

frugalmalefashion,3dnhak,jberry21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:31 2015 UTC,I totally agree with this statement. The Aiden Chinos I picked up were 32x32. They felt too casual 32x30 and asked a sales associate what she thought - she said it looked much better 32x32. At my BR location each pair is $35.70 = $59.50 x 40% off.   The Aiden Chino has always been a recommend pick up on /r/malefashionadvice. I took this opportunity to see it for myself.

Eating 9$ to ship it PLUS the fact they don't do free return shipping is absurd to me.    edit:  opening ceremony has it in an XL for 50 DOLLARS https://www.openingceremony.us/products.asp?menuid=1&menuid2=209&designerid=253&productid=137017&sproductid=137020  Holy crap that's a great deal."
frugalmalefashion,3dn7wd,sloppy_jaloppy,6,Fri Jul 17 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"You can't find most of these shirts for more than 50% off. Plus, the stores that have it that cheap generally don't have much in terms of sizing. Example:East Dane has the 3-D Print but only in XS- Where as this sale has much better sizing. Bottom line you generally can't find most of this stuff for cheaper, and this sale has more sizes than other sites...   EDIT: The fact that OC only has it in XL is a perfect example..."
frugalmalefashion,3dn7wd,thequietobserver,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"Perhaps for this exact range of shirts, but I've seen blackwatch shirts for example dip lower.    If you aren't picky about specific print, GBV can regularly be had at $80, or even closer to 60$ if you wait for things like the unionmade sale or east dane additional % off deals.  $100-120 is what you should consider GBV's 'full price', if you are a frugal-minded buyer.  Source:  I own 5 or 6 GBV shirts, all acquired over the past 2 years, all acquired for 80$ or under."

Obviously its possible to find GV for that range, I'm simply saying that most of these shirts can't be had for less than 90-100 bucks. The fact that you own GV shirts in that range doesn't mean that this sale is ""shitty,"" and the fact that you said 100-120 is ""full price"" for a ""frugal buyer"" means that this sale warrants attention from frugal buyers..."
frugalmalefashion,3dn7wd,thequietobserver,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it's shitty that they set the price point at $97.50 and won't honor the 100$ minimum for free shipping.   I'm also saying it's not THAT impressive of a sale given that you can find them elsewhere for less.  GBV sales from their site are always like that.  Like you said, you can find a better selection of sizes from the site, but better prices elsewhere.  Finally, I did not say it's not worth looking at.

But GV's sales are generally hugely popular and sell out quickly due to the fact that they have, like we've agreed, ""a better selection of sizes"" and prints than anywhere else. If you're willing to pay 10-20 bucks more you can get exactly what you want in the size you want without having to wait around and gamble that you'll get lucky on East Dane or Revolve or something. For instance, I'm getting the 3-D print because its been hugely popular this year and I seriously doubt I'll be able to find my size elsewhere..."

To be Honest, with Herschel, you do get what you pay for. 50% of that price goes to the item itself and 50% goes to the Herschel name.  Depending on what your tastes are, you could get this (http://www.amazon.com/Samsonite-Tote--Duffle-Luggage-Turquiose/dp/B003KR1K4A/ref=lp_15743211_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1437289668&sr=1-1) duffel from Samsonite for half the price of the Herschel.

You could get this (https://www.everlane.com/collections/mens-bags/products/mens-weekender-reverse-denim-navy-stripe) classy one for $95.  I just urge you to consider other weekender style duffles. You can get a Fjallraven for under $100 if you're smart about it, and they last forever. I've owned a Herschel backpack before, and the quality is abysmal. The second you get it in your hands, you realize that it's made of the same materials your Power Rangers backpack from the 2nd grade was. And it's the same marketing principle. It looked great, but it lasted about 3 weeks before it started to disintegrate."

Some people want their bag to be noticed by the brand name, and buy things more the sake of brand name, not really caring about quality.

It's been with me on at least a dozen flights to a handful of countries (usually checked in the bottom of the plane, though it does fit as a standard carry on for most airlines), and countless train and road trips.   It's a little too big for me as a weekender, but it's the perfect size for anything longer than a weekend and shorter than a couple of weeks. I can easily fit about a week's worth of clothes in there plus a change of shoes. I've had it for about two years, and it's hasn't shown any signs of wear. One thing is that the handles are synthetic and not real leather, and I've heard they're pretty prone to wearing out.

frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,Softcorps_dn,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:34 2015 UTC,I bought these on a rec from a friend but they didn't form a good seal with my ear so I gave them to my sister and they fit her fine. They were too oval on the bud for me but the jvc gummy+ are also really good for the same price and I have a couple of those now.

frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,Bazofwaz,-3,Fri Jul 17 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Going in, the only things I wanted were the SDXC memory cards and gift cards. The memory cards sold out amazingly fast and I barely got in on the gift cards.  People seem to be spending a significant amount of time bashing a sale. Having low inventory is a reasonable criticism, but to me their selection was fine - there were good deals on needs and wants for me, and I ended up spending more than I expected going in. Too many people were expecting amazing prices on latest generation items like PS4s and 4K TVs, and don't understand the difference in having a sale in July vs. November."

frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,pmatt21,2,Sun Jul 19 05:25:30 2015 UTC,I thought the 30% off men's fashion/apparel was pretty decent.  Napped a Victorinox Chrono for $115 no tax and Polarized Ray Ban Aviators for $81.    Electronics were meh.  Lot's of mediocre quality/reviewed items in the mix and many things had no preview/ lead-in (like the $115 40inch LED.)
frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,jhnkango,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"Posting again but removing the product page links.  Memes and jokes notwithstanding, Amazon Prime day had absolutely stellar deals.  You know how retailers trick consumers into thinking they actually give out good deals on Black Friday ""because it's Black Friday,"" on TVs/laptops, when in reality, they just sell items that have shitty components, battery life, quality, are difficult to move otherwise, and people end up buying it anyway because they won't bother checking the 3 star reviews on it?  Amazon actually put in an honest effort to give great deals on quality products. The TCL LE40FHDE3010 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED TV was on sale for $115. The 4.5 star reviews suggest it's a good deal even at the $289.99 listed price.  I got this sweet VIZIO M49-C1 49-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED HDTV for $599, the only item I wanted. Good reviews.  Amazon didn't just put up any 3-star TV, knowing it would probably sell anyway, because they just wanted to move aging inventory. They actually put quality products on sale that people would appreciate owning. Kudos to Amazon.  Yes these high-ticket items sold out in 3 seconds or so, but that's no one else's fault, you snooze you lose. Not being able to get in on a deal doesn't mean a good deal wasn't to be had.  I got the Allen Edmonds Mainstee Belt for $45.93 before tax after all promotions. That's pretty damn sweet to me. I got a 24-pack of redbull for $22. I can list more.  Imagine Common Projects Achilles going on sale for $200 on Prime Day and selling out fast. People would probably still shit on Prime Day/that deal because it's not good enough or something, which is ridiculous.  EVERYTHING listed sold out, and several items sold tens of thousands in qty.  Talk is cheap. Actions speak louder than words and people acted by buying. They bought because the deals were at historic lows for too many items to list, which means they were great deals. The internet is not stupid, if they weren't good deals, they wouldn't have sold out as many as they did. Amazon sold something like 64 million products that day with 350-400 items per second. An example, a Bose headset that sold 9 qty the previous Wed sold 51,000 qty that day.   One of the shitty things that happened during sale day was some people made a thread on slickdeals/fatwallet and listed when the high-ticket electronics would be going on sale, which were almost all in the morning around 6am-9am PST. So people stayed up all night.  I was one of the people that stayed up all night because I didn't want to miss the good deals.   There were almost no sales during the night, which was obviously a good decision from Amazon because they didn't want to encourage people to stay up over the night.  But everyone was pretty much tricked because of the unverifiable forum post setting expectations. A lot of criticism came up to noon PST already that Prime Day was a disaster because they expected good deals when there were none, when the good deals hadn't even started yet. But that wasn't Amazon's fault at all. That was just some random guys making up rumors and gullible people (like myself) believe them, when we should have no reason to believe.  There were some sweet i7 desktops/laptops. 35% off a single food item. 30% off most clothes. 512GB Crucial SSD for $160. Amazon Kindles & Firesticks on sale.  Too many items to name. It was a great day."
frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,IThinkImAContra,2,Fri Jul 17 07:01:53 2015 UTC,"People weren't looking in the right places. I got 225 dollar Rogue Moto jeans for 55, I got black Clarks CDBs for 30, got a 1tb hard drive for 40, all of these prices being way cheaper than I had seen before on all these items. I think most people were focused on the lighting deals, when in reality the warehouse deals was the place to look with the extra 15% off everything. I mean come on, when has anybody seen CDBs for 30 shipped? The only issue with them being ""will arrive in damaged box."""

Got the Nexus right off the bat and the TV on the wait list. I'm not sure what people were doing wrong, but if you waiting on the page with the countdown timer, as soon as it went live, that item just refreshed and there was a button to add to cart.   BUT....there were still a lot of bullshit deals. I had to wade through 1000's of phone cases and bullshit items. The layout was atrocious. They were selling a refurb laptop for $20 less than it was brand new as a deal... that's definitely not a deal. A lot of the stuff on there wasn't really a deal. The 128 GB flash drive for $29.99? I got one a month ago off a gold box deal for less than that."
frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,jhnkango,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:05:39 2015 UTC,"Without any links, it's hard to comment on what you are saying. Which refurb laptop are you talking about? Which flash drives are you talking about? Not all flash drives are created equal, some are fast and others are slow. A Patriot Supersonic Rage 2 for $29.99 is an absolute robbery, whereas if you got a Lexar 128GB Flash drive for $15, your deal is still a lot shittier. In fact, I'd skip out on your deal.  Although I will say that it's probably true, I got the 128GB PNY Flash Drive for free after Tigerdirect rebate. Sure not every single deal may have been the absolute best in history, and that's O.K. It doesn't need to be. The overwhelmingly vast majority were."

No, because it only distracts from the point and doesn't contribute meaningfully to the sub.  All too often, we ignore this bullshit online. We acquiesce and let it slide. But that only suggests that it's okay.   It's not.  Stop being part of the problem here.

frugalmalefashion,3dix4h,Citizen_V,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:32 2015 UTC,Agreed - i didn't see the original comment (it was deleted). Just questioning that rule because disagreement can be good sometimes.

The color of the leather is just one piece of what makes a shoe formal or not.

Under no circumstances should you size down to reduce toe room. The most important fit concerns are the flex point and heel. If the additional toe room bothers you, it may be beneficial to look for a last that offers less toe space. At minimum, there should be half an inch of toe room. Many find an inch of toe room to be preferable."

I initially bought the ray ban clubmasters in polarized lenses but found the 49mm too small so returned them. The clubmasters also come in 51mm, but no store carries them, especially in polarized lenses. The escapades are equivalent if not better in build quality to the clubmasters. They feel solid; the brown lens is crystal clear and the polarizing is great. One downside is the lens is not very dark but I prefer lighter lenses so it works for me. In fact, Shuron is the company who first designed the ""clubmaster"" style. Overall I am very happy with them. Bonus fact: the escapads are actually the shuron ronsir frames with tinted lenses.

That's a great all around shoe, it's lighter and more flexible than these guys, and has a slightly compressible sole.  They can be worn comfortably for virtually any exercise.  Conversely (sneaker pun, yay), the AdiPowers are heavier, more stable (your feet feel glued to the floor), with a slightly higher, uncompressible heel, and are generally uncomfortable for anything other than Oly lifts and squats, maybe OHP.  They're for people who are moving big weight and want a stable surface to do it on, as well as for people with ankle mobility issues that are alleviated by this shoe's advantages.  If you don't have any issues with your ankle mobility limiting your squats, and your feet feel stable at all positions in whatever shoe you're currently using for your squats, the Powerlifts will probably be totally fine for you.  On the other hand, if you're planning on progressing to the point where you might eventually be an ""advanced enough lifter to warrant these,"" this is a great price and these shoes will last you forever."
frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,so-cal_kid,3,Thu Jul 16 17:01:09 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the detailed response. I don't do any Oly lifts but am looking to improve my squat. My ankles do have issues due to old basketball injuries so I may strongly consider these.
frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,suxer,2,Thu Jul 16 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"You should also take into account that these shoes arent meant to be general gym wear, as in, if you are doing deadlifts you shouldnt use them for that lift.   That means that you might have to take two pairs of shoes to the gym or schedule your workout around your gym gear."
frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,saintlawrence,2,Thu Jul 16 22:05:56 2015 UTC,Are these any good for deadlifts?
frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,RP340,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"No.  Well, the non-compressible sole is but the heel is not.  Stick to barefoot/chucks/beater chuck-a-likes."
frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,RP340,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree for myself, but there are people on both sides of the fence on this one, a lot of people do like DL'ing in weightlifting shoes.  I think this one is a matter of individual physiology."
frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,Citizen_V,2,Thu Jul 16 21:41:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean I guess that should come with the usual caveat that everyone's leverages are different. But I don't see how being elevated would help anyone pull from the ground. Is it an ankle mobility thing or a hip level thing or what?

frugalmalefashion,3dilrc,PriceZombie,2,Thu Jul 16 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"Remember guys.  Weight goes up, weight goes down.  Lift until you can't lift anymore.  Lift as many days as you can for as long as you can, doing as many lifts as you can, splitting upper and lower body.  People overthink weightlifting and think they need all this gear.    And channeling my inner strength coach:  YOU CANT GET STRONGER BY OSMOSIS, so get down and lift those weights, STOP TALKING TO THE VOLLEYBALL TEAM,  WHAT ARE YOU DOING JUST SITTING THERE?

frugalmalefashion,3df0f1,Soezin,12,Thu Jul 16 11:50:10 2015 UTC,The current trend in fashion is anti logo.  It's a reaction to the heavily branded 2000 and 2010s.

The main issues are the zipper and other hardware is not good, and the leather that connects the shoulder strap to the bag is thin and cheap, so these components wear out really fast with normal use.  They did discontinue another bag that I had (the gunner) for similar issues, and they replaced it with a nicer bag with YKK zippers for me for free so I'm happy with that, but if you are looking for something BIFL or near I would go with a different brand."

frugalmalefashion,3dkdzf,sweetpadre,10,Fri Jul 17 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, you'll get mixed opinions here on MFA on them depending on who you're talking to. If it's the ""the worst leather shoe I own is Allen Edmonds and I'm part of a Viberg MTO group buy"" /r/goodyearwelt crowd (nothing wrong with you guys, I'm subbed), yeah it's pretty uninspiring, and you should look elsewhere for your chukka needs. Not the worst thing ever made, but pretty low on the bar. If it's the ""the -best- leather shoe I own is Allen Edmonds and I think my CDBs are pretty well made"", then you'll think they're surprisingly decent for the money. I think this dichotomy is something you'll notice over the scarce amount of discussion on them here (lots of ""it's shit get the MacAlisters"" ""no it's not shit it's pretty decent the MacAlisters are too expensive""..MFA has this weird swing between being sometimes being overly pretentious and other times defending something that's legitimately really bad because it's sort of cheap. When you see an disagreement between the two camps, it's probably a good sign). Compared to the MacAlister, the leather is a little bit thinner, but not by much (think Bushacre vs CDB), and it's synthetic instead of crepe soled, which is good for inclement weather but bad for comfort. Coming from my personal perspective, which is somewhere between the two groups above, I think they're pretty decent bang for the buck. Better than the Golden Fox chukka which was popular here a couple years ago, a little worse than the MacAlister, but at its price I think it's killer. I'm planning on waxing the pair I sort of bought on a whim a while back just for shits and giggles, and I think that'll add a lot of appeal to them. The shape is dressier than CDBs, but they look good with a more upscale outfit. They have the same look and profile as MacAlisters so any outfit you see with those, for all intents and purposes it'll look the same.  Tl;dr: Leather is a little thin, style looks good, quality is really good bang for the buck, good budget buy over the MacAlister at ""normal"" ($100+ for the MacAlister, $50 for the Calvert). Bad compared to most expensive chukkas, very good compared to most cheap ones."

I would buy the beeswax chukka CDBs but I already have the high top version (Desert Mali) and the overall styling and shape is pretty much the same, so I was looking for a casual shoe with a different color/texture/last. Looks like I'll be giving the Calverts a try!  Btw, sorry to OP for going completely off topic of the shoe that was actually posted"

It has held up nicely, it is well made. I think the complaint of the top main zipper probably comes from the fact that it curves in two spots, but this new design has a straight zipper run, so would not have the same problem. Mine has never given me problems, but because the zipper is curved I do take extra care when using it as to not screw it up. The zipper is pretty hefty, though. I really like how the interior of all the pockets is a nice burgandy color, it's a nice detail that adds to the quality of the bag. I also like the small side zip pocket, as well as the two water bottle type pockets that were included on my version, but not this new one. I get a lot of use out of those extra pockets and I'm wondering why they took those off this design. I'd recommend this bag if you want a nice looking weekend duffel with decent capacity. I can fit several outfits as well as a pair of shoes/boots."

frugalmalefashion,3dct1e,stanleythemanley44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd just wait and get one from the store. You don't wanna cheap out on a guitar and it's something you really want to try out before you buy. Like a pair of boots."
frugalmalefashion,3dct1e,ihaverocketlegs,4,Thu Jul 16 04:25:40 2015 UTC,"What kind of guitar are you looking for (acoustic/electric, left handed, etc), and what's your price range?"
frugalmalefashion,3dct1e,yakandyeti,2,Thu Jul 16 01:47:29 2015 UTC,acoustic.. buddy (awesome guitarist) highly recommends Fender Tim Armstrong Hellcat... http://www.guitarfella.com/best-acoustic-guitar/beginners/  100-350 probably.
frugalmalefashion,3dct1e,badger0511,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:56 2015 UTC,This is a great deal IMO
frugalmalefashion,3dct1e,yakandyeti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"seems like it's a great deal, tbh but buddy asked me not to buy a packaged guitar as the guitar doesn't really tend to be that good. I've only held guitar a couple times in my entire life. Not sure whether to go for it or go for the one he recommended (hellcat) http://www.guitarfella.com/best-acoustic-guitar/beginners/"
frugalmalefashion,3dct1e,badger0511,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with his statement, but a cheap Fender package will run circles around a cheap First Act package.  But if your budget is up to $350, I'd probably recommend something else than what I linked originally. I just went with something that's passable for a beginner that doesn't break the bank in case you decide strumming is not for you."

I travel a fair amount (long trip once every 2 months) and have a carryon and checked size bag.  Both have done really really well for me.

For that price, I'm not expecting them to last much more than a year (maybe two) and if they do, I'll be pleasantly surprised.  Bass Buckinghams are hard to find for <90 (they're different than the Pasadena) so if they're in your size, it would be a good deal."
frugalmalefashion,3ddq34,Drummer223,3,Wed Jul 15 14:39:08 2015 UTC,I got a pair of Buckinghams for ~$40 a few years back and I love them.

frugalmalefashion,3ddq34,SolublePolarBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:32:44 2015 UTC,Quality is hard to tell at this point for me... I've had mine for a bit. Worn 4-5 times. They definitely are very comfortable and the leather seems decent at least. Fitting is true to size.
frugalmalefashion,3ddq34,duttarightthing2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"I can't exactly answer your comparison question, but I've worn mine 10+ times at least since I've bought them, including one 14 hour session walking around in Toronto. I've never owned a pair of Sperry's nor Sebagos.  The right shoe insole's top layer (I'm assuming it's multiple layers) is coming off a bit by the toes. My feet aren't too sweaty, so I'm not sure what caused it. It doesn't affect me in any way, just thought I'd point it out. The sole and the rest of the shoe's leather have kept up well. The laces haven't broken and don't look frail -- though GH Bass sells replacement laces so I wonder if boat shoes are prone to having their laces falling apart.  Overall, they're really comfortable. I remember putting them on the other day and thinking ""why didn't I get boat shoes earlier in my life?"" As I mentioned before, I've never owned another pair of boat shoes before so I don't know if Sperry's or Sebagos are more comfortable or not.  You should also know that I bought them on sale, and would NEVER consider buying any shoes from GH Bass unless they're on sale. They run this 50% off deal almost every other week now, with intermittent 40% and 30% sales too. If you have shoprunner, shipping is free. I think I paid $44 for the shoes, shipped. Well worth it."
frugalmalefashion,3ddq34,whilst7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"I worked at Bass, you get what you pay for with the boat shoes. Sperry's are a little more extra, but they last. I wear Hampton II's to work every day and they get trashed."
frugalmalefashion,3ddq34,mama_luver_666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:49:09 2015 UTC,Do you feel a difference between Sperry's and Bass'?
frugalmalefashion,3ddq34,SolublePolarBear,2,Wed Jul 15 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"Initially, no. After a bit of time, definitely. Bass shoes get destroyed not long after purchase."

I am offering steep discounts on all my ready to ship items and am offering even steeper discounts on a few samples. I've posted this a few times already, but have added a few new items.  Check out my Etsy store for more options. If you see something there  that you like that isn't listed below, shoot me a PM. I might just send you a discount code :)  All prices add $7 for USPS priority shipping to the US. $15 to Canada and $25 everywhere else.   As far as purchasing - if you are interested in anything below PM me and I will send you a custom one time use discount code so you can purchase the item through Etsy. My store is relatively new, so I would certainly appreciate reviews if you do buy something.   NEW ITEMS  Russet Harness Bifold SECOND - $63  Pics  This is second quality because of a minor blemish on the leather. I use a metal clamp to hold my stitching pony closed and, while I was adjusting the wallet during stitching, I accidentally closed the metal clamp on the wallet. There are marks, but they are not that noticeable and they will become even less noticeable as the wallet ages and develops a patina. These marks are visible in the pictures. I made my personal wallet out of this leather and after a few weeks it has already started to darken down in places - the patina on this leather is awesome.    The wallet features 4 card slots and a bills pocket.   Mid-Wallet SAMPLE in Russett Harness and Natural Veg Tan - $126  Pics  This is a design I have been working on for some time. The sample came out nearly flawless. The only issue is that I did not install the zipper 100% correctly. That being said the zipper still look and works just fine. Most people wouldn't even notice the issue. This wallet is larger than the rest. It measures approx. 3.5in x 6.25in closed. It features a zip pouch, 3 front facing card slots, 1 hidden card slot, 1 hidden pocket and a full size bills pocket.   I am working on a belt loop tether that will attach to the wallet's grommet. Once it is complete it will be available to whoever buys this for 30% off.   BI-FOLDS and TRI-FOLDS  Natural Chromexcel/Natural Veg Tan Bi-Fold - $63 SOLD  Pics  This bi-fold features 4 card slots, two hidden pockets and a bills pocket. 4.5oz natural chromexcel exterior, 2-3oz Hermann Oak natural veg interior.   Hand Dyed Walnut/Natural Veg Tan Bi-Fold - $63  Pics  This bi-fold features 4 card slots, two hidden pockets and a bills pocket. 2-3 oz Hermann Oak veg tan all the way through. I hand dyed the exterior.  Natural Chromexcel Bi-Fold - $56 SOLD  Pics  This bi-fold features 4 card slots and a bills pocket. Made entirely out of 4-4.5oz horween natural chromexcel cowhide.   Slim Snap Tri-Fold - Russett Harness/Natural Veg Tan - $52.50  Pics  This slim tri-fold features two interior card slots and a cash pocket. Wickett and Craig Russet Harness Exterior, Natural Veg interior. Solid brass hardware.  SAMPLE - Natural Veg Tan Bi-Fold - $45  Pics  Sorry for the phone pics on this one. This is an early design that I decided not to go with. There are a few cosmetic flaws - a small wet spot on the front, and a scratch within one of the hidden pockets.   This wallet has 4 card slots, 2 hidden pockets and a bills pocket. 100% Hermann Oak natural veg tan.   SAMPLE - Raw Selvedge Denim/ Natural Veg Tan Bi-Fold - $40 SOLD  Pics  I made this after accidentally destroying a pair of jeans and it became my best selling wallet to date. 16.5oz slubby Japanese denim exterior, Hermann oak veg tan interior. 4 card slots and a bills pocket.   CARD WALLETS AND CARD HOLDERS  Clifton Card Wallet - Natural Veg Tan - $35 SOLD  Pics  100% natural Hermann Oak veg tan leather. Easily fits 2-3 cards per slot and some folded cash.  Clifton Card Wallet - Burgundy Chromexcel - $35 SOLD  Pics  100% Horween burgundy chromexcel horsehide leather. Easily fits 2-3 cards per slot and some folded cash.  Warren Card Holder - Burgundy Chromexcel - $28 SOLD  Pics  This card holder can easily fit 2-3 cards per slot and some folded cash.   Madison Card Holder - Natural CXL - $21  Pic  This card holder easily fits 3-4 cards and some folded cash and, with time, will stretch to hold more.   Madison Card Holder - Russet Harness - $21  Pic  This card holder easily fits 3-4 cards and some folded cash and, with time, will stretch to hold more.   Norton No-Stitch Card Holder - Natural Veg Tan - $24.50  Pics  Natural Hermann Oak Veg tan. Solid brass hardware. This no stitch design allows 6-7 cards to easily fit in the inside pocket. This wallet also features an exterior strap for fast access items like folded cash or your ID."

(I'm attempting to see what finish they are and condition of the leather just to cover my bases). Also, as far as fit goes, I currently have some Red Wing winter boots (405s I believe) in 9.5 and they're somewhat loose when not wearing thick winter socks. Do you think these would fit alright? I remember the heritage boots being larger than the others I tried on, and cannot remember for the life of me if I was a 9 or 8.5 so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks!"

frugalmalefashion,3d9gtg,JacketThief,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm in the same boat. There's also always the option to finance a better quality TV through bestbuy. They offer no-interest financing for 6-12 months depending on the amount. It should last longer as well and you get the brick and mortar warranty."

frugalmalefashion,3d9gtg,sweetpadre,3,Tue Jul 14 23:06:35 2015 UTC,I believe that Amazon has a policy that if an item goes on sale within a certain time frame they will refund you the difference. IF you contact them.

frugalmalefashion,3d9gtg,omegax84,4,Tue Jul 14 15:50:43 2015 UTC,Why not just order it again and return the higher priced one you bought first if it is still within the return period. Excluding items that are electronics as the have specific serials/other things.

Also, if you go into a specific Department (ex. Electronics & Computers > TV & Video) the opening page will have deals on there.   I don't see why they would change the way they've advertised deals. You can also add an item you think might go on sale, and if it does, it'll price adjust accordingly if it goes on sale."

frugalmalefashion,3d9fpg,agarci7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:24:34 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity - what makes these sneakers ideal to lifting vs regular sneakers?
frugalmalefashion,3d9fpg,michaelhe,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"These are intended for Olympic weightlifting (snatch and clean and jerk). The elevated heel allows one to get deeper into a squat with less ankle flexibility, which in turns gives you a more upright torso position in the bottom position. This is helpful because catching a weight lower means you're not lifting it as high. You'll also notice that the heel is extremely rigid. The sole basically does not flex beyond the toe box, and in fact Adidas used solid wood heels on older models (ironwork, adistar). The solid heel helps eliminate micro movements which may interfere with stability which is crucial when dealing with heavy weights. Just imagine holding 200lbs overhead in a pair of running shoes. The fat soft heels are not a stable platform, and if I exaggerated the example, it is like standing on a boss ball while trying to lift. Finally foot strap locks the top of the shoe down onto the foot. It is commonly taught to torque your heels in (and tracking your knees out) when squatting out of the bottom position).  By strapping the foot in, more torque energy is applied through your legs in to the ground, because less of it is lost due to any ""play"" in the shoes.   The shoes are also useful for front squat/ back squat, pistols and rowing. You'll definitely see an improvement in doing pistols, but besides that, I'm cautious to say that they'll make you squat more.   I do not wear them for deadlifts, as the additional heel height means that you are actually lifting the weight a bit higher and your starting angle is a bit more forward.   I would say these shoes are absolutely necessary if you are doing snatches and clean and jerks. (Even the poorest oly lifters in the corners of the world wear some form of oly shoe with these basic features). If you aren't doing oly lifts, I would say your money is better spent on powerlifts. Also, if you want to start doing oly lifts, get a certified usaw coach."

frugalmalefashion,3d9tp2,Unhelpful_Scientist,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"So this is not going to keep any heat in it correct? I really want something to just keep wind and rain off me, and I have been considering this Penfield rain jacket but this Marmot seems like a better deal if it is completely unlined."
frugalmalefashion,3d9tp2,NiggaLetsTryItOut,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"The difference between the two is that the Marmot has a water impermeable membrane + a DWR coating, so it's an ultralight dedicated rain jacket.  The Penfield you linked is more of a nylon windbreaker/shell (porous, will let water in), with a DWR coating that will repel water.  But once the DWR coating is soaked (a couple minutes in heavy rain), it'll leak through and you'll be wet.  If you want a rain jacket, the Marmot is definitely better.  If you just want a windbreaker with some water repellency, both are good."

They did it with almost all of the girls stuff, including basics, casual shirts, button ups, sweaters, and some other stuff. For boys they are starting to hide it a bit more by not making it a contrasting color.  In store right now they brought logos back but it was mainly just for back to school. In the fall we'll be getting a lot more without logos. I personally can't wait because as of now the only Hollister stuff I'm even willing to wear are some unbranded hoodies or the boxers."
frugalmalefashion,3d97p2,rizdog23,3,Tue Jul 14 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah not a fan of logos, even subtle ones, myself. Its a shame because some of the stuff is actually decent quality for a pretty easy to swallow price. The basic tees are 9.95 so if they came without a logo I'd buy em in a heartbeat especially my discount would essentially make em 5 dollar tees haha"
frugalmalefashion,3d97p2,rizdog23,2,Tue Jul 14 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yah, they can't even be subtle.  If one person notices you know they are judging you.  Kind of funny though that they have pretty much admitted their brand reputation is so shitty that they have to hide the brand name.  Of course if they weren't logo whores to begin with they might not be in this boat."

The person who talks to you will then go to the store, and proceed to try to buy the item from them.  If they can get to the point where they're one click away from purchasing, they'll honor the price.  Then you get nordstrom's free shipping + free returns + no return sunset policy."

I made an order during the last sale except some of my items weren't actually ordered, but I still had the tax for it. Called up customer service and they let me place another order and waived the shipping. Waited a week or so with no updates, and then got an email saying my original order was cancelled. Called up again to ask what was going on and to check on my other order. They couldn't really tell me anything, but a few days later, my second order was cancelled as well.  That and the constant errors/maintenance on their webpage makes me pretty weary of placing more orders with them."

frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,Yeaga,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:37:30 2015 UTC,You seem to know a bit about nudie. How are the jeans overall? I'm usually a levi guy but recently bought some j crew 770 that fit well. Any comparison or thoughts you can give me before buying a pair?
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,ambyance,3,Mon Jul 13 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"Nudie's quality for retail price is a little steep, but at this price point, which is about half off, I would recommend them. The thing that makes Nudie special is the sheer amount of different fits they offer. Where some places only have a straight and a slim, they have tapered, super skinny, regular, and a whole slew of other ones. If you're in the market for a specific type of fit, they can probably suit your needs. I would say they're a step up in quality from mall brands, but not a huge step."
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,pb7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:57:42 2015 UTC,Thank you. Are they a heavier jean or lighter?
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,anbujar,3,Mon Jul 13 19:14:36 2015 UTC,Different products have different weights. I believe they list the oz. on their product pages. Heavier than a typical pair of levis usually.
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,nydjason,4,Mon Jul 13 19:16:42 2015 UTC,nudies are pretty legit. got a cult following and get good fades...
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,SorryBobo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:57:23 2015 UTC,I have two pairs and I have never been more satisfied with a clothing purchase in my life. They're incredibly comfortable and fit great.
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,neerajm14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:02 2015 UTC,Any recommendations on fit considering I were levis 513 and J Crew 770?
frugalmalefashion,3d52qi,sandfourman1,2,Tue Jul 14 01:10:21 2015 UTC,Steady Eddy i would say. But then again you have to understand that all N&F bottoms are cut 34 to 36 length so if you fall into the 30 to 32 length category then the fit doesn't really apply much to you. The great thing about Nudie is that they have 3 length sizes which is ideal and how it should be if youre looking for a perfect fit.

frugalmalefashion,3d5bf1,yourfriendkyle,4,Mon Jul 13 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"I personally feel it looks childish. Derbys are for the office or semi formal settings. The open-lacedness looks awkward with dress pants imo. Oxfords have a tighter more formal look.   To add on, it also depends on the derby. For example, a plain toe black derby is much more formal than a brogued brown one. Wearing this derby in a formal setting is too casual though imo"

frugalmalefashion,3d5bf1,blades4,3,Mon Jul 13 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think the other user is exaggerating, but i can sorta see where he's coming from. It depends on how long you've had those shoes.

By far the most comfortable dress shoe I've ever worn.   I had to resole the Park Ave after about two years of daily wearing. The leather soles wore out and a hole down to the cork came through. They're good as new now except the insole is already molded to my foot. The uppers are in near mint condition. A few light scuffs but otherwise it looks great.  Definitely worth the money.

frugalmalefashion,3d0ig5,Hawaianhamster,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:59 2015 UTC,"Just saw the AE shoes posted on this thread. I'm going into dental school, and want to be frugal (try taking $300k's worth of extra loans in one go) yet want to be respected, but not looked upon as some rich kid who buys expensive shoes (mostly because I'm broke as hell with said loans).   With that said, are these AE shoes worth it? I see people saying that these shoes has been going up in price and I feel like these can also last me a very very long time, but at the same time, I don't know if I would use them very often or be looked down upon. I also don't know the quality first hand to say that these shoes would end up costing me less because other shoes might wear down over a period of time and I'd have to repurchase shoes when I can get these resoled.  If I buy these shoes, at what price point should I buy them at to make them a frugal purchase?   I see there are several models of AE shoes. If anybody is fluent in the AE line, can someone give me the details on what makes each shoe unique and their foreseeable use? Since I'm an absolute beginner in dress shoe buying and have been turned away from purchasing many shoes from people on this and MFA subreddit because I keep choosing ugly/low-quality shoes, I'm rather unconfident in my shoe buying. I'm mostly saying this because I'd really appreciate a more detailed answer than ""this shoe is good for formal nights, this shoe isn't""."
frugalmalefashion,3d0ig5,eddrix,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yes there are worth it.  No you will not be looked down on. The people who might look down on you for such a thing aren't going to notice. Besides as you already noticed this is a better investment long term.  You should look at:  McAllister  Strand  5th Avenue  Park Avenue  listed roughly from most casual to least casual (See bottom of this chart)  The nordstrom price starding Wednesday is good, but you can purchase factory seconds from http://www.shoebank.com for cheaper and those will go on sale a few times a year if you are not in a hurry.  The Brooks Brothers models if you can find in your size are just as good (different type of sole I think) and $100 cheaper.  Colorwise, As in the chart above, brown is much more versatile than black and walnut is probably the most popular brown.  All in all, I would Walnut Strands or 5th Aves and someday get Black Park Aves."

frugalmalefashion,3d0ig5,robotic_lemur,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"The way your questions are posed makes it hard to give advice.  Yes, these are worth the price. If you want dress shoes for infrequent use, use this guide and get some off of eBay.  The Park Avenue is the favorite ""formal"" dress shoe. I picked up a used pair for $30. It took a long time to get that deal, but it was literally a steal.  McAllisters or Strands are a good medium between formal and casual. Both styles can be dressed up or down.  Are you buying shoes to wear to class? How are you going to be dressed? The reason you probably aren't getting good feedback is because you're asking for shoes with no context. Tell me the setting you'll be wearing the shoes in, and the outfit you will pair them with. Otherwise my recommendations will be off.  If you need shoes for casual wear, you may not need Allen Edmonds... You could get a pair of Bass Buckinghams for casual use. Clark's Desert Boots get circlejerked a lot too. What use do you need out of your shoes?"
frugalmalefashion,3d0ig5,Hawaianhamster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"Sweet, I have a few saved searches on and hopefully something comes about. Thanks for the tip!  Class uniform is business casual or scrubs. There will be ceremonies where it's suit and tie-like and conferences I'll have to go to. I probably say that I can probably get by wearing dress shoes less than 10 times a year, but having a more casual dress shoe means I might be able to use them when I'm taking someone out now that I'm -recently- single. Sigh, gone are the days where I can wear sneakers to everything."

New to this sub, and throwaway because I’m about to include some body details in this post that I’d rather not link to my real account.   So, the good news is, I just got a new job! I start in about three weeks, so I have a little bit of time. The thing is, this new job is business casual (button downs/polos and nice pants/shoes) but my previous jobs have been very casual “jeans and a t-shirt” kinds of places, so my wardrobe is a bit lacking.   I currently have a pair of light colored khaki pants and medium gray khaki pants from Old Navy, a light grey suit, a white button down shirt, about three gingham shirts (green, blue, and black), an array of ties, and black Johnston & Murphy shoes. I also have a navy blue polo, and a turquoise-y polo, plus a burgundy lamb’s wool pullover from JCrew Factory for the wintertime.  I want to get a few new outfits, and since this new job comes with a significant raise, I’m budgeting up to $500 for new clothes.   At this point, I’m not even really sure where to start. I guess I need (at minimum) new slacks, a few button down shirts, maybe a polo or two, and brown shoes. What should I add to my wardrobe to make it more “business casual,” and where should I buy these things? For reference, I’m about 5’5”, 190lbs. Broad shoulders and a little larger around the middle.

frugalmalefashion,3cyrfn,tmx84,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:23 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why it must be a size and a half, any idea why they would make this a rule just out of curiosity?  Is it documented somewhere?"
frugalmalefashion,3cyrfn,HungryHippo44,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:58:43 2015 UTC,It's because a half size difference is extremely common and in most shoes creates a negligible difference in fit. When it's as drastic as a 1.5 size difference there's no real getting around that and Nordstrom accommodates those with that issue.  Source: Nordstrom shoe salesman

After a bit back and forth - they price matched the shoes!!!  Combined w/ Amex's $50 rebate from a few months ago, this means a pair of strands are <$200 before tax. :D"

frugalmalefashion,3cxkqh,court_in_the_street,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"I did the exact same thing as you.   10.5 in sneakers, 10.5 on brannock device, Wolverine 1k was either too tight on the instep at 9.5 or too long at 10 and I'm probably going to have to sell the size 10 that I recently bought.  I debated over whether I was going to take a shot on these or not, then I saw size 10 and size 9 sell out and figured what the heck, at this price you can't lose, and grabbed one of the last available at 9.5.  As far as the length and width, a 1000 Mile in size 9 would have worked for me, those things are so much longer than the Brannock sizing... but there's no oversizing in the instep at all, it's such a weird fit for me.

frugalmalefashion,3cxkqh,TheBordone,4,Sun Jul 12 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Depends, honestly. I have wide feet (stupid bunions) and my experience varies depending on the shoe. I wear a 10 in Vans, no wides available as far as I know. They fit for the most part, but wear out at the widest part of my foot usually before a year. I wear a 10.5 in Clarks Bushacre II, again no wides available. Had to size up by half to accommodate my foot. My AE Fifth Avenues are a 10 3E. I believe when I tried on some Iron Rangers last, the 10 wide fit best, but I can't recall exactly. I'm going to buy a few pairs from Amazon and just return the ones that don't fit."

frugalmalefashion,3cws7l,crownboat,9,Sat Jul 11 22:08:40 2015 UTC,This. Leave it out in the sun for a few days and it will go from a creepy skin-tone color to a more rich brown. After that you just wear it and will develop it's own color.   My only complaint with this belt is the nickel plated buckle. It just doesn't match-up with the quality of the belt itself but isn't a deal-breaker at this price-point. I plain on buying a new buckle in the future.

frugalmalefashion,3cws7l,CRCasper,5,Sat Jul 11 19:25:22 2015 UTC,Just throwing in my opinion for anyone considering buying an Orion belt: do it. They're extremely beefy and high quality all around. I can't imagine a belt from any other manufacturer could be more durable. I have one of their bridle belts with brass buckle. Owned it for a couple years now and it's still good as new (albeit with some lovely patina) with almost daily use.

frugalmalefashion,3cws7l,aman_lie,2,Thu Jul 16 16:12:27 2015 UTC,I dunno. I wear a size 34 in Levis and I got a size 36 belt. It fits well.  If you order true to size you will be on the last hole of the belt. That just looks weird because belts look better with a little extra length to tuck into the next hole. Plus you should leave a little room for growth.  The way these are made the last hole is set very close to the end of the belt.
frugalmalefashion,3cws7l,Boner_Forest,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"This is because like most jeans Levi's has vanity sizing. My Actual waste size is 34"" and I wear 32"" in Levi's.

Honestly, my favorite belt I have ever bought is the genuine leather two loop belts from banana republic on clearance for $10 each down from maybe $40 msrp.

The Orion belt is bade from full grain leather. This means one solid piece of leather. There is nothing to delaminate or deteriorate."

All Mr. Porter did was ship you a pair of shoes that have possibly been tried on and returned previously. That isn't great, but is pretty standard and often actually a blessing (it's the reason things sometimes appear back in stock late in the sale and give people like us an opportunity to scoop them up).   No company is going to refund you for the taxes and customs you were charged. Expecting that is simply unreasonable. This whole situation is just a combination of poor luck, the perils that come with all international orders, and Quoddy having a downgraded line.

Under American law, if you've got a unilateral sale contract (I.e.: you provide money, I'll provide the good as advertised), then however the company selling the good wants to limit their liability, they can choose to do so. That's why most companies cover return shipping, but some don't. I imagine that the CBSA covers duties and taxes as a backstop for any consumers ripped off my companies that don't cover those costs in their sales contracts.  Then again, I don't know for sure because I've never ordered from Mr. Porter, so I'm spitballing."

But the page doesn't say MiUSA either, so I think my point still stands that porter didn't try to misinform"
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,d4nimal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"OP very clearly said the listing said Dominican Republic at the time of his purchase, then he went ahead and ordered and got mad that he had to pay import fees from DR and not the US. This post is not worth anyone's time."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,fumfarjr,11,Sun Jul 12 06:31:48 2015 UTC,Any pictures so we can see what kind of condition/quality they came in?
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,xkenn,10,Sat Jul 11 05:57:43 2015 UTC,"I live in a country with insane import tax, and no company has ever refunded me the tax.   On the other hand, Mr. Porter is the only company to pay DHL to come physically pick up the return at my apartment and send it back to them without me having to spend a penny"
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Lonewolfmoonmoon,5,Sat Jul 11 06:42:33 2015 UTC,"That sucks, sorry about that experience.  I've also had nothing but a great experience when I bought a leather jacket from them, but none of that involved the shitty specter of import duties."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,figuren9ne,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:14:32 2015 UTC,"Well, if the product was fine, I would have had a good experience too. I didn't even know Quoddy makes inferior shoes in the Dominican for a premium menswear company like Mr Porter."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,chickenfark,3,Sat Jul 11 02:20:26 2015 UTC,Yeah.  That's some good info to tuck away for me as well.
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,chickenfark,7,Sat Jul 11 02:25:23 2015 UTC,Do you think you could maybe show pictures of the shoes?

Shipping costs will not be refunded for items returned using our free collection service.  If your order has been sent to a destination within the EU, all sales taxes will be refunded. Outside the EU, customs duties and sales taxes are non-refundable through MR PORTER. However, you may be able to recover these by contacting your local customs bureau directly. As this may not be available for all countries, we recommend that you hire a customs broker if you wish to claim back duties on returned merchandise.  Please note that refunds can take up to 10 working days to show on your account due to varying processing times between payment providers."

There are excess strips of leather on the inside of a boat shoe. Just bad. Plus they were worn before I got them.   They were completely unwilling to reimburse the amount I paid.  I would say that leather scraps scratching my feet is a faulty item, wouldn't you? Anyways, I'm just extremely disappointed by their service. I'd expect this from a discount site like 6pm but not a place that sells higher end goods."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Xianricca,14,Sat Jul 11 02:18:26 2015 UTC,pics?
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,xspect,7,Sat Jul 11 02:23:35 2015 UTC,They are completely willing to reimburse what you paid Mr. Porter for the shoes. You need to handle the import duties refund with Canadian Customs. You didn't pay that money to Mr. Porter and it's part of the cost of trying to score good deals internationally.
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,STMWut,4,Sat Jul 11 13:08:20 2015 UTC,can you link to the shoes? I can't find anything about DR made quoddy's.

frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,slyck80,7,Sat Jul 11 13:21:37 2015 UTC,Based on the original post. Mr porter has agreed to refund the purchase price and clearly states on their forum how to recoup taxes or custom.   please direct me to which business would refund customs / duties ?   I think the OP has made an irresponsible post. because they are too lazy to follow thru with his part of recouping his fees.
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,mandeepy,2,Sat Jul 11 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"Still sounds scummy to me. But I guess you have to be a Canadian to understand. It's not that easy to recoup those customs charges and since he had to pay $30, that's 20% of the total cost lost right there. Now if the shoes they sent weren't dirty then this wouldn't be as big of a problem."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Camacho1,3,Sun Jul 12 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"Leather defects according to OP, but without pics there's no conclusive evidence. If there is indeed excess leather on the inside, how is Mr Porter suppose to check that? Do you want them to have people personally try on each shoe?   Dirty soles isn't something to complain that much about, shoes get tried on and sold. As long as there's no wear on the sole what does a bit of dust and dirt matter? The shoe definitely doesn't count as used."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Kortspelet,3,Sat Jul 11 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'll keep it in mind, as I'm Canadian, but I've ordered from Mr. Porter several times and had no trouble."

frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Kortspelet,4,Sun Jul 12 07:57:37 2015 UTC,I was browsing styleforum the other day and also saw people complaining of used shoes with slightly worn soles. So yeah these may very well be returns.
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,akaghi,2,Sat Jul 11 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"Despite what others say, it sounds like the shoes were not as described, which violates Canadian consumer protection law. Call your credit card and request a chargeback citing item not as described. They will refund the full amount, including customs and tax, and Mr. Porter will have to pay a small penalty (usually $25.00 in Canada).  Tell porter you are happy to ship them back at their expense as soon as they send you a prepaid shipping label. Good luck!"
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Citizen_V,4,Sat Jul 11 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"Did you purchase via credit card? If so, call your credit card company and they should take care of you. If not, why didn't you purchase with a CC?"
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,scholl43,5,Sat Jul 11 05:06:36 2015 UTC,And do a chargeback on CBSA?  Not sure how much success he'd have doing that.  He's better off filing for a refund directly from CBSA.
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,Def-not-a-throwaway,-1,Sat Jul 11 08:38:40 2015 UTC,"Not a chargeback, just talk to the CC and tell them what happened. I've had similar things credited to my account after discussions with a CC rep."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,akaghi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:20:17 2015 UTC,They were really made in the Dominican R? Is posting a pic for proof possible? As a Quoddy fan this is mildly infuriating.

If not, you can assume it's made in China. Also, the duties thing seems weird. You don't pay duties for something made in China, because they send you the shoes from wherever they stock them (US, UK for example).  The defects however are definitely a problem. It seems very weird that you couldn't return them and I definitely understand your frustration."
frugalmalefashion,3cvau8,akaghi,2,Sat Jul 11 07:19:37 2015 UTC,"You don't pay duties for something made in China, because they send you the shoes from wherever they stock them (US, UK for example).   Country of origin matters. If it's from the US (or Mexico), NAFTA applies and the customs fee is a lot less."

If go to Dakine for a better backpack than these, and for the super cheap a Jansport. But please avoid The North Face as their warranties are no longer the same either.  Other than that, the ergonomics of the bags are really good, they just aren't of superior or buy it for life quality anymore."
frugalmalefashion,3ct50g,SirTechDiff,7,Fri Jul 10 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"It's true that quality hasn't been the same since VF Corp. bought The North Face, but the warranty is still outstanding. I typically go through backpacks every 3 or so years, and each time TNF has replaced my bag free of charge. I've been through two Hot Shots, with one being replaced last year with shipping being the only expense. I now carry the Waterproof Daypack and it has held up fine. For those new to TNF, I'd recommend the Recon, or if you need greater than 30L of space get the Big Shot 2."
frugalmalefashion,3ct50g,JonasBrosSuck,7,Fri Jul 10 17:42:37 2015 UTC,"Word. VF Corp does do some profit-maximizing damage whenever they take over a brand, but VF is also responsible for Vans and Timberland - products consistently recognized for their quality (and in the case of Timberland, their warranty and industrial application).   It's by product, honestly. TNF's packs are still solid and borderline unbeatable value for the money, but their hardgoods aren't what they used to be."
frugalmalefashion,3ct50g,Daredizzle,2,Fri Jul 10 17:53:56 2015 UTC,Neither Vans nor Timberland are known for their quality. Timberland's quality especially has really declined.

The newer jackets waterproofing is heat activated and sometimes it needs to be warmed up again. The other thing I can't emphasize is washing your jackets. But you're breathable gore tex has millions of pores that get clogged up from your sweat and dirt and needs to be washed every so often.

Made in the USA with a lifetime guarantee they actually hold events where they want you to load up the pack with 50+ pounds and trudge along with them. They actually find weakspots from these events and improve the design of their packs, which are now hideously indestructible.   That said, yeah the pricetag probably scares most people away.

frugalmalefashion,3ct50g,imrannabeekhan,2,Sat Jul 11 00:07:44 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the rucksack style ones. Herschel would be a popular brand. They are actually pretty impractical.

frugalmalefashion,3ct50g,5ee5,2,Fri Jul 10 23:20:57 2015 UTC,Mind you even Herschel ones are pretty bad quality. They are just the IN brand at the moment.  I mean not saying they are useless though but more of an opportunity cost thing going on here. Modern backpacks have so many more features it feels mundane going back to one of those backpacks. Really the only good reason is if you like the look of it or if you don't care about the frills of modern backpacks. Which of course I admit plenty of people don't need a bottle holder or whatever.

The Bar III suit is the most often recommended here and is the one I have experience with. Right now it is matching the offers from Calvin Klein and others. However, it is not at the optimal price; Jacket+Pants add up to $250. The ideal time to buy is at $200 and under. If you need a suit in the immediate future this is a reasonable price for the quality you will receive. Need to know what size to buy? Make a search and discover that this question has been asked many times. Likely there is a person with a similar height/weight to you that can give you an idea of the size to buy. You can likewise find recommendations of value for the suit. First suit? Buy Navy or Charcoal if you're lost with the choices. Check out MFA for knowledge and to develop an idea of what you want. But seriously, first suit? Get Navy or Charcoal. Whichever catches your eye better. Returns are free to Macy's stores. If you live nearby one you can order multiple sizes and keep the one that fits. Got your eye on a Calvin Klein or other brand suit? The price/value range is likely at average for this sale. Feel confident to buy a suit as long as you check that you're buying a 100% wool suit. No rayon/polyester/vicose pls. That's a big no no.   Got questions? Ask me. It's Friday and I'm in a good mood. I own a Bar III in navy and happy enough with it to recommend to others."

JCPenny has claiborne or stafford 100% wool suits for ~150-180 on sale.  I like the fabric of the 100% wool stafford suits.  Next step up would be suit supply and it's a huge step up in price and quality.    I prefer the cheaper suit options as daily suits and keep my SS and BB for when I want to impress."

frugalmalefashion,3cspod,absolutebeginners,12,Fri Jul 10 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"These shoes look great, they do. But unless you're actually putting in mileage to work towards minimalist/barefoot style running, there's very little chance that these are going to be appropriate running shoes. Very little support. Again, if that's really what you're going for, these shoes are fine. I just see a lot of new runners gravitate toward these as their first ""real"" running shoe after doing little to no research on their own. The best thing to do if you don't know what ""your"" shoe is yet, is to go to your local running store and request assistance in determining what shoe is right for you and your posture/running style/goals. Odds are, this is the wrong shoe.  tl;dr  This shoe probably isn't right for you but there's a chance it could be, albeit a small one."
frugalmalefashion,3cspod,jdlyons81,5,Fri Jul 10 16:20:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! I didn't realize what style the shoe was. I was able to use similar shoes in the past to change my running form into a toe/side foot strike rather than a heel strike. Running with a heel strike has always given me ankle problems because my feet pronate. Is there any benefit to training myself to strike on my toes rather than get proper shoes for a heel strike?
frugalmalefashion,3cspod,absolutebeginners,4,Fri Jul 10 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure because running styles are such a personal thing. I could tell you there's a benefit but such a blanket statement wouldn't work for everyone.

frugalmalefashion,3cspod,jdlyons81,3,Fri Jul 10 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"I went from heel to toe striking and damaged my metatarsal heads, which went on for two years, which in turn caused some mild plantar fasciitis.  If you do anything, go from heel to midfoot striking.  And get proper shoes at a running store.  It's going to cost an arm and a leg, but that's better than having screwed up feet."

frugalmalefashion,3cspod,thewallbanger,11,Sat Jul 11 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you run.  If you use proper form they feel amazing. I was running with Asics with a ton of support and I kept getting shin splints. Asics had so much support that they'd make me lazy and I wouldn't be as careful with my form.  I switched over to these shoes and now I never have any injuries after running. I run about 5 miles a day every morning, and because they have such little support, they force you to consciously make an effort to run properly. Not only do you injure yourself less, you're working your body better as well."
frugalmalefashion,3cspod,Fuckledore,7,Sat Jul 11 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"I am also a ""serious"" runner I guess (30 mi/wk, 63 min 10 miler time) and I run in these, too."

frugalmalefashion,3cspod,Webby911,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"My normal mileage is a little under 30. A couple years back I did the Hal Higdon advanced training plan for 15k. I don't know what the exact mileage was during the program, but the intensity of the running was far more challenging to me than the mileage, given my base. I ran the Army 10 Miler in DC in 63:30ish. I've worn Nike Frees for several years now, and I recently switched from the 5.0 to 4.0."
frugalmalefashion,3cspod,psmittyky,5,Fri Jul 10 16:46:53 2015 UTC,Fix your running form. It's not the shoe

Running form is important, but it absolutely does not negate all injuries.  Find the shoes that work best for you and use those.  That might be these and it might not."
frugalmalefashion,3cspod,cnc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:50 2015 UTC,You probably heel strike; these shoes are really only meant for midfoot strikes.

At the end of the week I had to limp all the way home and had massive stabbing pains all over my calf muscles. It was like someone was sticking a knifes in random places really fast and lasted for around 40 minutes and they ached for days after.   Not fun at all. I don't blame the shoes either just my out of shape body. This is also warning people not to do the same thing I did. Give yourself time to adjust and don't push it too far too soon."

frugalmalefashion,3cspod,quickly_,8,Fri Jul 10 19:13:31 2015 UTC,If you're wanting to begin to emulate barefoot running then yes. But these are two completely different running shoes. The cumulus is far more cushioned than the Nike Free. You should absolutely try on a pair of Free's before making that decision. You're not comparing apples to apples unless you're only looking at these for casual shoes.
frugalmalefashion,3cspod,jdlyons81,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:30:34 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I'll keep the Asics. I thought the Free's were actual running shoes lol. I didnt know people actually wore running shoes for non running purposes :)

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,secret__agent__x9,10,Thu Jul 9 13:37:34 2015 UTC,"I've had both for a while. Quick comparison:   1K has thinner leather that needs more care/attention. IR has thicker leather that stands up to more abuse and looks good doing it. 1K has soft metal speed hooks that get bent easily (this is surprisingly annoying - I've brushed my foot against a door and had that bend them) IR has steel speed hooks that are pretty hard to bend  1K has a leather sole that's USELESS in the rain and will start to slip on carpet after a few months of heavy use. if you get them, get a vibram half sole put ontop. This solved all my slipping problems. IR has a cork sole which is fine in the rain. No idea about snow/ice, ask someone who lives somewhere it actually snows. 1K insole came apart from the rest of the boot one day, leaving behind what looked like a white adhesive. Took them to cobbler, had it reattached. It's fine now, but that cost me another like $10.   So yeah, I dig the 1Ks, and they're comfortable and they look good, but I've had to drop more money on the vibram half sole, reattaching the insole and I have to oil/condition them probably once a month and keep aware of the soft metal on the speed hooks.   IRs have been comfortable from day one (though I hear other people have had long break in periods) and look good with minimal effort/upkeep on my part."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,veyd,8,Thu Jul 9 19:05:41 2015 UTC,IRs are terrible on snow/ice. I think Brooks Brothers sells a lug sole version for what it's worth.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,promethiac,3,Thu Jul 9 21:59:46 2015 UTC,As someone who goes to school in Boston holy fuck were the IRs a poor choice for snow/ice. I literally had trouble going up slight inclines.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,deviantzen,3,Fri Jul 10 05:46:08 2015 UTC,don't even think about wearing IRs on ice unless you get them resoled. That being said - I still wear them in the winter as long as I'm not going to be walking through an ice field.

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,CptObviousRemark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:32:54 2015 UTC,any idea why the 1k's cost $360 vs IR $319 ?
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,secret__agent__x9,13,Thu Jul 9 16:32:15 2015 UTC,"Red Wing owns their own tannery and saves on the cost of leather since they produce their own. Other manufacturers like Wolverine need to buy their leathers from tannerys like Horween which can get costly especially if it's a more exotic leather like Chromexel. Then, when the leather arrives at a place like Wolverine, they try to use as much of the expensive leathers as possible in their clicking process and inevitably don't click out all of the poor or thin leather which ends up in the boot and results in odd creases (Google it). Red Wing's leather is pretty consistent across the board.  Anyway, I got off on a bit of a tangent. Red Wing costs less because they are their own tanner. Also, in the world of boots, cost does not always indicate quality. Over at /r/goodyearwelt you can learn a ton about the subject."

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Nashgoth,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  FWIW, my boots that I bought as seconds weren't marked as seconds (meaning, there was no hole punched in the tongue).  I read either here or in GYW the other day, that the seconds aren't actually all ""factory seconds"".  They may be items returned or stock that needs to get moved. YMMV.

Quality is, undoubtedly, better with Red Wing though."

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Nashgoth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"I just use Red Wing's boot oil which is a combination of Mink oil and pine pitch.  I clean the boots first. Wipe away any large chunks of dirt, then use a horse hair brush over the entire boot to sweep away any smaller debris. Then I wet a rag, ring it out and give the boot a good wipe down all over. The cleaning seems excessive, but it's incredibly important to get as much dirt off the boot as possible before you oil them so you don't lock the dirt in. Dirt is abrasive and over time can do damage to the stitching and leather.  After the boots dry from  being wiped down you can oil them. I use an old t-shirt to apply the oil.  Allow the boots to sit for 24 hours after an oiling before wearing them.  I do this every 3 months.  Some people say that mink oil is actually harmful for the boot's threads and that coconut oil is actually better than Red Wing's oil. I've looked into it and I can't find concrete proof that that's true, so I just still with their recommended pine pitch+mink oil product."

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,nekkidfauno,6,Thu Jul 9 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"While I am a (new) Nordstrom employee, I'm not sure. AFAIK this is the sale of the summer so if they're not on sale now don't get your hopes up."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,weirdasianfaces,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:56:44 2015 UTC,"cool, thanks. i wasn't specifically thinking about the nordstrom sale but just in general for the beckmans, but still good to know"
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,nekkidfauno,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:08:33 2015 UTC,Can I ask you a few questions through PM regarding Nordstrom?
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,devastitis,2,Fri Jul 10 02:56:38 2015 UTC,You can get them used for about $50-$60 less (around $120-$140). It's harder to get them though because everyone wants one.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,nydjason,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"Wait until the tent sale in the fall.  I'm sure someone on here will go to Red Wing, MN and act as a proxy"
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Seanay-B,-3,Thu Jul 9 16:40:47 2015 UTC,You'll have them for years and years. It's a smarter decision to pay $200 for these now than paying $50 per pair of shoes every year or two.  I have IRs in Amber Harness. They hold up really well. I oil them about every 3 months. No complaints. I even wore them through Chicago winter which people say they're terrible for.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Turquoise_HexagonSun,13,Thu Jul 9 19:56:05 2015 UTC,"They'll need resoling, remember. That initial cost doesn't cover you until the end of time."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,imkii,2,Thu Jul 9 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Mine lasted a solid five years and I wore them every day. A $65 resole job and I was golden.  I don't think I'll get another 5 years on the rest of the boots, but who knows?  At this rate the ownership cost is still just pennies a day.  EDIT:  These were US-made boots.  Dunno about the Chinese ones."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,SergeantTibbs,0,Thu Jul 9 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"Of course. That's a given. They won't need resoling in just a year though. I wear mine often, like 4 days a week, and I'll probably get 5 years before a resole."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Turquoise_HexagonSun,2,Thu Jul 9 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"I wore mine six days a week for about six months before the soles wore through (they now have a quarter sized hole in each) . Granted I walk at least four miles a day on street and sidewalk, which is a lot of abuse. Still, I was surprised at how quickly it happened."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,beldark,10,Thu Jul 9 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"Man, you must walk angry. Walkin' all hard.  Everyone has different strides I suppose. This isn't my first pair of Red Wings; my last pair got about 7 years on the sole with moderate to heavy use. I imagine with the nitrite cork sole I'll get about 5 years before I have Red Wing toss on a Beckman sole."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Turquoise_HexagonSun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:14 2015 UTC,I do a few miles or more every day on city sidewalks.  My leather soles would wear through in about 6 months of 3x per week use and never on wet days.  Had them resoled with a topy over the leather so they last longer.  Leather soles are now restricted to the office and special events.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,imaworkin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"I've had my pair for 2 years, but I don't walk 4 miles, 6 days a week. And if I did I would try not to wear combat boots."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,clnsdabst,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:01:56 2015 UTC,That's very unlikely. Closer to two years.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,imkii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm already at 18 months and nowhere near wearing through. In 6 months I'll quintuple the amount that I've done in 18?"
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Turquoise_HexagonSun,5,Thu Jul 9 21:28:09 2015 UTC,I bought these at 310 and don't really regret it. This is about as low as they get with a full size spectrum of availability.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,deviantzen,8,Thu Jul 9 21:43:24 2015 UTC,Full spectrum minus different widths. Argh.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Citizen_V,5,Thu Jul 9 14:21:49 2015 UTC,"will sizes be gone by the time the sale is open to the public? should i get the card now just so i can buy it, or can i hold off and likely get my size next week?"
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,trilll,5,Thu Jul 9 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anybody know if these will disappear before the pre-sale ends?"
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Davin900,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:04:20 2015 UTC,YEAH
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,JickSmelty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:13:43 2015 UTC,Definitely. But  I think they know when they have a huge item in hand so they might have more than a few in hand to last them awhile.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,nydjason,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:18:40 2015 UTC,Anytime a sale goes on for red wing or wolverine boots common sizes go out of stock within hours.

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,trilll,4,Thu Jul 9 23:40:41 2015 UTC,You can get these for 180 if you open up a nordstrom card for the first time. It's a 20 dollar credit that's put on the bill

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,moc_tidder,2,Thu Jul 9 16:05:24 2015 UTC,? you just asked on chat if you could buy now in the pre-sale with a regular credit card or what are you talking about?
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,trilll,3,Thu Jul 9 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"I genuinely got rejected when I applied online.  My intention to chat was only to check why I got rejected and see if we could fix that. She mentioned if I could call credit and fix that. I said, I cannot call as I am at work. She offered to do that herself, I gave a go ahead! But later she only asked for my bank card details, and asked if this was the nordstrom card. I reiterated again that I was rejected for some unknown reason. She apologized and applied my bank debit card instead.   edit: wording  update: Let me clarify that in no way did I ask to pay by my regular card upfront. The representative offered to apply my regular card. Just saying, You may/may not get lucky but doesn't hurt trying."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,moc_tidder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"They Accepted your normal debit card? As in you didn't have to open up a Nordstrom debit card?, what did you even say to the representative?"

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,moc_tidder,3,Thu Jul 9 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely get red wing over wolverine (better QC, styling, and leather). Personally the IR are more versatile than the Moc Toe, but you do you"

She also said they honor price changes within 7 days of delivery so if you order something now and the price goes down, you can get that difference reimbursed."

I really need boots with a Vibram sole or something that is better than this. Aside from the Red Wing Ice Cutter does anyone know any other quality dress boot that looks great with a sole made for not falling over?
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Cemetary,5,Sat Jul 11 07:15:03 2015 UTC,Red Wing Beckmans?

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,trilll,2,Thu Jul 9 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Nothing's wrong with the color itself, but I would have purchased them in any other color."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,lawnpuppies,2,Thu Jul 9 18:05:23 2015 UTC,I would just wait until some holiday sales go around   I got mine for 140 last November and J Crew always has their Red Wing Wabasha boots go pretty cheap after Christmas too  Which I like a little more to be honest
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,barkev,2,Thu Jul 9 18:06:29 2015 UTC,you think its very likely that these will be priced lower somewhere and easy to get around fall/winter? im struggling to decide if i should pull the trigger or wait. i wouldnt mind waiting to save $50 but if they're gonna be hard to get at that price i might as well just buy now
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,trilll,3,Thu Jul 9 17:28:11 2015 UTC,They always go cheaper during the holidays   This subreddit always goes crazy for them and posts links like these during the holidays   Think of it this way If for some reason they don't go down to 140 during holidays and they end up being the 180. You still get the same deal you would have gotten today   They always go on sale
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,barkev,2,Thu Jul 9 18:05:09 2015 UTC,good point. i suppose if sizes are plentiful during the holidays at the sale prices ill just go ahead and hold off. thanks

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,needmoregold,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:09:25 2015 UTC,"8.5 or 9 would be fine, id probably lean towards the 9 since itll be larger and more accommodating to the thick socks you should probably be wearing with these.."

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Patrick_and_Finn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Nordstrom has excellent customer service so you can buy and exchange as you need to. I'd probably try size 10.5 first. The leather will break in and stretch. The boots are comfortable for all day wear, but you'd probably want to break them in at home first, before wearing them all day at work."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,stacky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"They're extremely comfortable. But for a work boot they're too slippery with the sole that comes with it, IMHO.  I'd wear them as a casual boot, then when it comes time to re-sole you can change it out to a more work friendly sole, then you can repurpose it as a work-boot."
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,GasStationSushi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:09 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I need something to wear within the next week or so. With the sole being slippery I might have to look elsewhere. Do you have any recommendations for something around this price range or cheaper that is quality and has a semi nonslip sole? Also that I could wear outside of work. Thank you very much.
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,Hegro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:25:44 2015 UTC,so you can't buy these until July 17th?

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,MustachelessCat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:16:22 2015 UTC,So when you apply for the debit card does it give you the note immediately and then once you spend $100 it takes $20 off that $100? Or do you have to spend $100 first to get the note?

frugalmalefashion,3coa45,atooraya,2,Fri Jul 10 18:44:35 2015 UTC,why would nordstrom let you exchange a used pair of shoes? they would give you a brand new pair of the same model?  seems like a lot of ppl would abuse that policy if thats the case
frugalmalefashion,3coa45,trilll,-2,Sat Jul 11 00:09:20 2015 UTC,I appreciate the downvote but they have a gold standard for return policies:   What is your return policy?  We don't actually have a return policy for purchases made at Nordstrom stores or at Nordstrom.com. We handle returns on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of satisfying the customer. We stand behind our goods and services and want customers to be satisfied with them. We'll always do our best to take care of customers—our philosophy is to deal with them fairly and reasonably; we hope they will be fair and reasonable with us as well.    http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/return-policy?cm_ven=Linkshare&cm_cat=partner&cm_pla=10&cm_ite=1&siteId=QKfOgZNb5HA-t43fzw973jZZykjEgjtoyA

I have 4 pairs of the MiJs in my rotation and they are some of my favorites (also they have 7 to 8 years of wear on them so they're pretty broken in).  I think the new selvedge denim at Uniqlo is Japanese denim (Kaihara?) that is assembled in Bangladesh."

I understand their sizes are smaller but being that far away from other brands in the industry just makes it quite difficult to shop online."
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,AlpineSensation,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:19:22 2015 UTC,"I hear ya.  The only ways to know what will fit when buying online are to look at comparisons from people who have both, or the small chance that brands will post their measurements (like Naked and Famous does).

frugalmalefashion,3couy9,bombers_ou,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:04 2015 UTC,Great review. IMHO Uniqlo jeans on sale provides the best value in the market. When they just opened the 34th St store several years ago I picked up a pair of regular jeans for $10 that is still going strong today. I picked up the PBJ one during the last sale.
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,Statiix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:21 2015 UTC,Thanks - appreciate the feedback.  The only thing that can hold a candle to it at ~$30-40 I think is Gap when their raw selvedge goes on mega sale.
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,TheI3east,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:27:21 2015 UTC,Is the Naked and Famous skinny fit sort of like a Levi 511 slim fit? Doesn't look too tight like normal skinny jeans.
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,AllegedlyImmoral,2,Thu Jul 9 19:44:56 2015 UTC,It's not that skinny.  I just went and tried on a few 510's and 511's.  It's definitely closer to 511.
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,rogun64,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:52:55 2015 UTC,the cuff opening is a tad bigger than 511. super skinny fit has a more similar cuff opening to 511 but is also a bit slimmer in the thigh
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,rogun64,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:51:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know a whole lot about selvedge/raw denim but I picked up two pairs of the 15$ uniqlo selvedge jeans over the weekened. I'm usually a size 29 but went with a size 28 cause I wasn't sure if the would stretch out. Anyways, the fit is okay around the thighs but from the knee down and the leg opening feels way too big for my liking. I wanted to know if you think it is possible to taper these to make the leg area smaller. Would a 6'' opening make them impossible to get my foot through since the denim feels thick? Or should I go 6.5'' to get a skinny fit. Also, if I went to a tailor, how could I explain to him what I just said"
frugalmalefashion,3couy9,AllegedlyImmoral,4,Fri Jul 10 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"First, turn your jeans inside out and mark the leg opening to your desired measurement with a pen on the non-selvedge side (it's on the inside, no one's gonna notice the pen mark and it's gonna help your tailor know where to begin his stitching in case he forgets). Go to the tailor and explain to him that you want to taper your jeans to a slimmer/skinnier fit and ask him to pin it FROM THE NON-SELVEDGE SIDE up to your desired location (usually the knee or mid-thigh, or even all the way up to the crotch; again, depending on what type of fit you want). After he pins it, walk around, sit down, see how you feel in them. If you like how he pins it then it's all good from there. Just make sure you bring an extra pair of pants  when you hand off the one you're wearing or you'll walk out looking like an idiot lol."

frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,throwawayfordimc,2,Thu Jul 9 17:56:27 2015 UTC,The design on the toe. The stitching on the toe is similar to Alden Indy boots. Normal 1000 miles are plain toe
frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,grizzly_giant,2,Thu Jul 9 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"The Courtlands have rubber traction while the regulars have a leather outsole. The rubber traction will perform well in snowy, wet conditions.  The Courtlands also has a moc design at the toe box."

frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,wilsonhhuang,5,Thu Jul 9 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"They're both considered to be work boots so that's going to be tough but if I had to answer, it would be the regular 1K miles. The rubber traction of the Courtlands is going to have a more outdoor-sy look."
frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,ImHalfAwake,3,Thu Jul 9 22:56:41 2015 UTC,I don't think either are considered formal at all...
frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,BobbyAdamson,2,Thu Jul 9 23:53:22 2015 UTC,"Remember to size down a full size when ordering.   I am a 9.5 in nikes,  9 in wolverine 1k, and these were too large at a 9.   Edit: This is specifically towards the courtland model.  Size a full size down as they fit larger than 'most' other W1K models."

frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,dano8801,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Wolverine sizing is so weird compared to any other shoes or boots I've worn.  I'm a 10.5 on a brannock device, and a size 9 in the 1000 Mile is long enough and wide enough for me to wear.  Except that the instep is so tight that I can't lace them up comfortably unless I go up to size 10, and even then it's pretty snug. I don't have a high instep or anything unusual either... I'm kind of surprised the 1000 Mile is as popular as it is, considering how odd this fit is."
frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,oraanges,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"i dunno if the fit/sizing is really that odd though. i measure right at or just under an 11, and my size 10.5 1000 miles fit me pretty well. they are a bit tight in the instep, but i think that's gonna relax a bit with some time since they're also brand new.  and i don't think the fact that you can't lace anything up until you get to a size 10 means 1000 miles have an odd fit. you probably just shouldn't be sizing down that far to begin with. even if it works for some other brands, work boots are kind of designed to have some extra room, and you should be able to wiggle your toes pretty freely. i guess there aren't any rules about how a man can or can't wear his shoes that he pays for, but i think a lot of people tend to size down a lot farther than the manufacturers intend."
frugalmalefashion,3cp9cr,dano8801,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:19:53 2015 UTC,"you probably just shouldn't be sizing down that far to begin with   I agree, sizing down that much, you shouldn't expect it to be comfortable in the instep.  My point is that the 1000 Miles are a full size longer and slightly wider than any other shoe or boot I wear in the same size, but unfortunately sizing down isn't an option because the instep isn't also oversized.   but i think a lot of people tend to size down a lot farther than the manufacturers intend.   I could be guilty of this. My CDBs fit me like a glove (and are perfectly comfortable), but from what I've read about boot sizing, knowledgeable people have said you're supposed to have a roomy fit. Maybe I'm just not used to that."

frugalmalefashion,3coeax,BigDaddy47,7,Thu Jul 9 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"The name ""Unionmade"" was conceived around the notion of well-made and aesthetically classic goods. It also conveys what we are about: Collaborating, uniting and making things together. While some of what we sell does come from union shops, that's a happy coincidence. We are interested in well-made American style and aesthetically classic goods, many of which are made in the United States, but we're not affiliated with any unions, other than the unions, civil and otherwise, that tie us all together. Unionmade opened in November of 2009 in a pre-1906 earthquake Victorian storefront at 493 Sanchez Street, situated on the border of San Francisco's Mission and Castro districts. In April of 2011, we opened a second outpost at the historic Brentwood Country Mart in Santa Monica, California. Voted one of the country's 10 best independent men's stores by GQ Magazine and San Francisco's best men's store by SF Weekly, Unionmade is known for our outstanding selection of men's casual and fine clothing, shoes, print and men's grooming products.

Something in brown leather might be nice, like these (although something sleeker might be better). I've looked into the the Bass Pasadena as well, but I'm concerned it's a bit too bulky."

These are designed to be winter boots, so they are very warm, but they are also expensive and even though leather is a wonderful material, it gets a heck of a beating going through snow and salt. Also, even though they are designed to handle the cold and snow, they're ankle boots. I know that MFA as a whole doesn't like higher cut boots too often, but really, in the winter, sometimes it's nice to have some more function lol. With all that being said, I still go with a leather boot during the winter, I just bought something a little cheaper and a little more functional, specifically the the Redwing Irish Setter Wingshooter which I got on sale. Looks a lot like the 877 Classic Moc."

I would snatch a pair of Red wings but I bought a pair last year in Charcoal. This is the Amber Harness so it should be more flexible for your outfits. Overall the prices for Red Wings remain constant with past Anniversary sales but AE and Wolverine keep for some reason increasing their MSRP's. But the selection of AE this year is way bigger than previous years. Usually just Strands and Park Aves get the cut. So if you're in the market for wingtips, boots or even plain toes, this might be your sale. Me...I will pass. I am tapped out hard from the Mr. Porter sale.

frugalmalefashion,3ckl04,concurrenthashmap,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:07 2015 UTC,If you are diving to 100 feet or deeper you are limited to 20 minutes (the time gets progressively shorter the deeper you go.) It could be to help differentiate that at deeper depths. Or it could just be an aesthetic thing. The SKX007 which is identical to the SKX009 except in its color scheme (all black instead of blue and red) does not differentiate the first 20 minutes so they could do it purely for aesthetics.

Very very comfortable, I'd recommend them if you like the style. Just a warning though: these are not your typical running shoes, they are a very thin shoe. The sole is thin and soft, and there is no padded inside lining it is just a single layer of leather. Not necessarily a bad thing, but expect them to feel closer to Vans than NBs."
frugalmalefashion,3cn4m5,Zack1018,3,Thu Jul 9 12:18:49 2015 UTC,I don't even think they are meant for running. They are super uncomfortable for anything outside of walking or lifting weights imo.

frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Prince_Uncharming,22,Wed Jul 8 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"They are actually designed with lifting in mind. Chucks are just popular amongst weight lifters because of the flat soles. As for going barefoot; if you lack ankle mobility for a good clean squat, taking your shoes off won't automatically fix that issue. Weightlifting shoes remove that factor with the raised heel. Hope this helps."
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,killxswitch,9,Wed Jul 8 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"I've lifted in Chucks plenty, and barefoot.  For DL I still go barefoot.  For squat, front squat, cleans, and really most oly movements, the stability and foot position of raised heel lifting shoes really helps with balance, power transfer, and confidence."
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Tective,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:31:29 2015 UTC,Are there shoes that are good for squatting and deadlifts?
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Tony_Chu,3,Wed Jul 8 14:58:20 2015 UTC,"Your foot position is different for the two movements, or at least mine is.  Chucks are a solid option for all-around lifting IMO.  Shoes w/a raised heel are not good for DL though, you don't want to lean forward when you're trying to settle back and pull.  Personally my DL started feeling a lot better when I took my shoes off."

frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,ironnomi,2,Wed Jul 8 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"I'd just go with Chucks then (high top).  They have a flat sole and if you dont care about color you can get them pretty cheap.  I also see a lot of people lifting in the Vibram toe shoes, but am not sure how good those are personally"
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,KnowsTheLaw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:55:21 2015 UTC,LAME.  But seriously if you want an all-around shoe Chucks or are fine.  I like oly shoes more but they're more specialized.
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,haffbaked,0,Wed Jul 8 18:02:00 2015 UTC,Could bend the rules and wear thin sandals?
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Jon_Tren_Yin,2,Wed Jul 8 16:53:15 2015 UTC,For squat you want a raised heal.  For deadlifts you want your heel on the ground.    A shoe that works for both will have to be a compromise.  For many people that compromise is reebok nanos or chucks.  Some people bring more than one pair of shoe.  I just take my shoes off for deadlifts like the commenter you are replying to.
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,solbrothers,2,Wed Jul 8 17:05:45 2015 UTC,They're not ideal for deadlifting due to the raised heel (this gets pretty heavily overstated) but they are perfectly suitable for it.  They're much better than using running shoes.  I go barefoot for deadlifts but if gym requires shoes I have no problem deadlifting in my weightlifting shoes.
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,KnowsTheLaw,2,Thu Jul 9 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"When they get a shoe with a detachable heel.  Ultimately you can get perfectly good at doing both in any shoes.  These shoes should allow anyone to post a higher number, but are you actually getting stronger?  No, it's an aid.  For some people with actual ankle mobility issues that are not really solvable, it could be a good aid like my left knee wrapping.  I have good lifting shoes, but ultimately I just switched back to Chucks or my Minimus MT10s, sure I can squat 10# more in the Romeleos, but I still progress at the same rate in either."
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Dezderp,3,Wed Jul 8 15:09:38 2015 UTC,"Chucks or barefoot is good, but this shoe will give you a lift in the heel, which will allow greater depth and slightly changes the mechanics of olympic lifting.   Bad for deadlifting, good for squatting."
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Archiballz,2,Wed Jul 8 13:48:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like you know what you're talking about so...slightly relevant question.   Would lifting in any sort of flat sole shoes do the trick? Lots of my skate shoes are just flat soled so never knew if they were okay to wear while squatting or deadlifting.
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,KnowsTheLaw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"That's fine, it's a matter of power disbursement, with flat shoes there's minimal power loss when you push, while with shoes that have shocks (runners, basketball), they absorb some of the force you exert, which is wasted"
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,theedoor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:50:42 2015 UTC,You want a very stiff sole. Any deforming of the sole will be detrimental to your lifting.
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Tony_Chu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"For squatting: running shoes are the worst.  Think of it like lifting on two tiny pillows, they're going to compress, which wastes power.  Also, they don't compress evenly.  Many people use these, this is a mistake.  Next best: chucks or any flat soled shoe that doesn't compress.  *** Yes, any flat soled shoes would do the trick unless you are into olympic lifting.  Best: Olympic lifting shoes.  They are build to be super hard, like ski boots.  You can strap them on tight, which allows more pushing out.  They last a really long time, you won't wear out your running shoes because you have these.  They have a raised heel, which allows for greater depth.

frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,DumaDuma,2,Wed Jul 8 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"It'll be like you're doing a slight deficit deadlift. Essentially, you'll have to pull the bar farther."
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Tattered,2,Wed Jul 8 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"You are higher up, so you are at a worse leverage point to lift it. You want to be lower for deadlift.  I still deadlift in adipowers, but it's not optimal if you are trying to move the most weight/train for powerlifting."
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,kevjohn_forever,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"i use my romaleos to deadlift in and it's fine, if you pull better in oly shoes - then go for it"
frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,Lord_of_the_Dance,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"They are better for squatting (and by extension oly) because of the elevated heal, hard sole and your feet feel bolted to the gym floor.  Very stable compared to running shoes.    That said, I still do deads barefoot because the raised heel isn't advantageous there.  These shoes are definitely very stable though, and I see people deadlifting in lifters all the time.    Depending on your squat stance, chucks or barefoot could be pretty good for you anyway.  The heel lift in this particular model of shoe is modest compared to some other lifters.  It's like halfway between a crossfit nano and an adipower.    Bottom line:  if you are lifting comfortably with chucks or barefoot, I wouldn't spend the money on these.  If you would like a little extra help keeping your knees out at the bottom of your squat, and use a medium to wide stance then these might be really awesome for you.  You will be amazed at how stable you feel.    They aren't any better than chucks for deadlifting in my opinion.  In fact I think they are worse."

frugalmalefashion,3cj54i,DaBombDiggidy,6,Wed Jul 8 17:40:45 2015 UTC,No they're pretty bad for anything other than olympic lifts and squats. The higher elevation of the heel makes it very awkward and hard to walk around in

frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,Checkers10160,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:26:49 2015 UTC,polyester is moisture wicking though is it not? They make athletic socks and that compression stuff out of it.
frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,Chr0nicler,5,Thu Jul 9 01:23:09 2015 UTC,For a suit jacket polyester is the warmest and least breathable.
frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,lwronhubbard,2,Thu Jul 9 03:24:32 2015 UTC,Good catch. I think it's still lightweight enough to cope with the summer heat though.
frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,Fereganno,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:27:29 2015 UTC,what kind of lining would be best?
frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,lwronhubbard,3,Thu Jul 9 03:09:40 2015 UTC,I don't know what's best but I know polyester is the worst. It's the least breathable and warm which is the exact opposite of what you want for this suit. Acetate is a solid lining material (at least according to Joe on dappered).

frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,The_Manscaper,5,Wed Jul 8 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"Linen gets wrinkled very easily, and is generally considered more casual. Saying that, a dark blue linen suit could be nice enough to wear to the office or a more casual summer wedding."

frugalmalefashion,3cjilo,godspeed727,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:11:03 2015 UTC,I would go short personally. R looks better for someone 5'9 or taller. But it really depends on how long your torso is though.

frugalmalefashion,3cjv7u,Pink_Mint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"I believe you should be. Before getting into raw denim, I usually bought a size 30 waist in Levis/H&M jeans. The best thing I can suggest for you to be sure about your purchase is to measure the waist of your favorite pair of jeans using the following method, under ""jean measurement guide"":  https://www.weargustin.com/fitguide  And compare your jeans to the sizes on the gustin website (same as above). That will give you the best idea of what your sizing is. All the jeans I'm selling are true to the measurements on the above webpage and haven't stretched at all, since they were never too tight in the waist for me.  TL;DR: I'm 90% sure what I have will work for you, but measure your own jeans and compare to be sure."

They're really not as great as people claim. I bought some on Amazon and was very unimpressed. The quality wasn't great, they stretched and rode up on my thigh within a couple of hours of wear and didn't do too well in the wash. I thought this may be an anomaly, so I bought another pair from REI and encountered the same issue. For the money, I think Under Armour's boxerjock and Spanx's boxer briefs are much better. Just my two cents."
frugalmalefashion,3ck4fu,yesterdayisdead,6,Wed Jul 8 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"They can't go in the dryer. The real claim to fame for EO products is they don't have to be thoroughly washed to be worn for extended periods of time.

frugalmalefashion,3ck4fu,blottomotto,3,Thu Jul 9 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"When I first bought a pair of Ex Officio's I was pretty disappointed: $20 for one pair when you can get 4 at Target.   However, as time went on I found myself saving the pair for special days like dance practice. I didn't want to be in a room full of students and risk butt sweat, but I also didn't want my squatters thighs rubbing together all class, so the ExO's were perfect: long enough to cover my hammies and breathable enough to not sweat a lot. I ended up buying 6 pairs.  Under Armour is too thin to really stop sweat, Target retains sweat too much, David Archy is nice but way too short on the thighs, and everything else just doesn't perform for me.  So as much as I hate spending money I figured I'd get the pair that works to my needs."

The anti-odor treatment makes a big difference--they allow me to go straight from an overnight long-haul flight to meet my clients without needing to shower or change clothes when I land.  They clean much easier in a hotel sink than many other brands, and they actually feel completely clean when washed with Soak brand rinse-less detergent.  Since they clean so easily it lets me pack much lighter as I only need to bring two-three pairs--they do their part to let me pack for a one-two week international business trip in a carry-on."

Tried Terramar from STP, and while they fit, look, and feel great, they smell so nasty after a wear, as everything polyester does. Exofficio isn't much better than your standard polyester underwear fit-wise, but they don't stink after a wear. I've not tried to pull off more than a day in them. Maybe it's the nylon, maybe it's the odor resistant tech (which terramar says they have, but it doesn't do anything), but it works."
frugalmalefashion,3ck4fu,pojosamaneo,2,Thu Jul 9 01:04:39 2015 UTC,I also found the Terramar to lose elasticity in the fabric and now they are baggy as hell on me after only 4 months of use.  I have to actually fold the waist band over itself so they are snug lol.  I took a look at my orders I paid 5.50 for those...both types too the ones with a logo on the band and without.  These at 9.80 after shipping/taxes blow the Terramar out of the water cause they last for 2 years with weekly washes.  Even at $15 a pair I would get them over the Terramar cause of the durability.

frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,ajenius620,2,Tue Jul 7 20:38:09 2015 UTC,Is it based on the retail price of the item or the final discounted cost?
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,bmk_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me, but certain items under $200 will not be included for customs.  If an item is over $200, but is knocked down with a sale price, it should also not be included in customs fees.  However, if an item is over $200, but a coupon code brings it down under $200, you might get hit by customs fees.  I think it has to do with what the invoice says, and sometimes the invoice will have the sale price but then subtract the coupon/promo code.  I just bought an Inverallan sweater with MSRP $329, but sale price $169.  I'm pretty sure that this doesn't add any customs fees, but we'll see."
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,ajenius620,2,Tue Jul 7 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"Assuming these ship from the UK, we should be duty-free on anything under $200? As long as END uses the sale price and not the MSRP it should be safe to cop a pair of sneakers."

frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,6t5g,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:24:22 2015 UTC,That's absolutely stunning. You said it was custom? How did you go about that. The buttons have me salivating.
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,Greyshot26,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Inverallan used to take custom orders a few years back. You had a choice from about 30 wools in various solids and flecked yarns (the donegal flecked yarns were pricier). You specified your size and length, color, and model. There was an upcharge for one of mtos but you could get a discount if you did a GMTO. They even did robes. I found this sweater on the secondary market and I paid a good chunk of change for it, but it was absolutely worth it. It's a hand knit sweater and for the price I paid it was more than a fair exchange. Other hand knits cost at least $500+. Inverallan eventually ended up shutting down their MTO program, theyve been through rough patches regarding labour laws because they rely on the cottage industry.  If you go through this thread you'll find all of this info: http://www.styleforum.net/t/156085/inverallan"

frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,imkii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"it's a double knit. It's incredibly thick. The gauge of the yarn is the same, but the double is much more dense because they use two threads instead of one. It ends up being much more dense and fitting because it's a tighter knit.   It was one of the custom options at a pretty hefty upcharge a few years back when Inverallan took MTOs. They closed the program however."
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,6t5g,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:54:08 2015 UTC,Interesting. Must be crazy warm. My single managed to get me through winter in Russia. I imagine the double would be a bit oppressive.   I remember when the program closed. There was uproar on SF.
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,imkii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"It's actually a bit too warm to be honest. It actually got me into a bit of trouble. This past winter I was obsessed with wearing it, to the point that it bothered my SO. We went out on a road trip and I made the big mistake of wearing the sweater while driving on the highway and I was sweating so I tried to take it off. The stupid thing is knit so densely that I couldn't take it off and I needed assistance from my SO to help me take it off which was not a safe maneuver while driving. I love the sweater so much it's a problem."

frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,BadgerPrism,17,Tue Jul 7 18:31:38 2015 UTC,But he's OP. He can criticize himself right
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,auf_der_autobahn,8,Tue Jul 7 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"I said ""sigh here we go again"" because every other comment thread on FMF has at least one user saying ""how is this frugal"" or ""this is $500, it's not frugal"" or whatever. And then another user comes in and says ""If you don't think something is frugal, don't buy it; everyone's definition of frugal is different. Frugality can mean value over time, it can mean significant markdowns on pricey name brands, it can mean cheap stuff. Do not post saying something isn't frugal, it may be to other people and these posts achieve nothing"" or their own version of that."
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,upvotes4pizza,-6,Tue Jul 7 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"I despise this debate, because ""fashion"" in itself is by definition not aimed at saving money -- it's a luxury.   This sub is focused on looking good for as cheaply as possible, but frugality at its core isn't really interested in looking good at all.   It's just a misnomer for a title really -- cheaper or discounted male fashion is really what this community is about. The actual definition of frugality can't include Rick Owens -- it doesn't mean people don't want to know when they're on sale.   Bring on the down votes -- I've just been wanting to get that off my chest for a while."
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,TexWonderwood,6,Tue Jul 7 19:12:11 2015 UTC,Well it's also in the sidebar. But there are always new users who come everyday who are just starting out and anything above like 30 bucks on a shirt blows their minds. I was like that before I got a handle on some things. Also probably a large part of why I always wore 10 year old t shirts and whatever pair of jeans.  It's a process I think
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,upvotes4pizza,2,Tue Jul 7 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. There will always be new users who are surprised, and they'll always start to realize the spectrum of what goes on here, but I don't think they're surprised that high end fashion goes on sale -- I think they're just right. It isn't frugal by any true definition of the word. Style forum calls theirs a sale alert thread, and no one is shocked by what's posted.   I really like this sub, but I think it had been started out with the intention to have a few timeless pieces to look good and fit in reasonably at work/school. It wasn't about $300 shirts or gothninja.   It's evolved past its name, which is fine. Communities are supposed to change over time. But new users aren't wrong when they know the objective definition of frugal and see high-end items no one whose main goal is saving money would ever really need."
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,auf_der_autobahn,2,Tue Jul 7 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest I haven't been active on the sub long enough to see it change much, but it sounds like it originally had more of a /r/buyitforlife influence than a /r/malefashionadvice one. Now it gets mentioned in MFA left and right when people want to know if they can get a deal on something, which may have contributed to the sea change."
frugalmalefashion,3cgcrm,Lonewolfmoonmoon,2,Tue Jul 7 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"Over the last 3 yrs it's gone from mostly  ""lands end"" type of discounted items to a ""red wings"" and jcrew vibe. In the middle of all that there was coupon stacking era, which was pretty exciting. I'd say the sub is at its best now. I've had to thrown away or donate all those lands end and h&m coupon stacked items that didn't last more then a yr.  Glad I'm not wasting money on cheaply made and manufactured. After 2 washes those items felt like money down the drain."

frugalmalefashion,3cfg16,6t5g,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:27:12 2015 UTC,Good deal on the brown 12. Were they also seconds?
frugalmalefashion,3cfg16,6t5g,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I believe STP only stocks 1k seconds.  I just bought my 3rd pair of seconds last week .. Lol, now I have 1ks in Rust, Black, and Color #8 (coming in tomorrow).  Selling the Rust ones though, I've had them for over a year and realized I had them a size too big (had to wear thick boot socks all the time).  Btw, the deal you posted the other day was a robbery!  I would've gone to the Scoop in SoHo if I didn't already have 3 of the same boot (in different colors), and 2 Brown CXL boots (Indys and Vibergs).  Definitely out of the ordinary for first quality 1ks at $97 because the usual good deal for 1ks are from STP when the seconds go down to ~$150.  I haven't seen any huge restocks in STP, but I realized that they probably restock single pairs once they have them in their inventory."

frugalmalefashion,3cfg16,B3NLADI4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"Most of the 1ks and RWs they stock are listed as seconds, but sometimes you'll order a pair and the boots will not be marked as seconds."
frugalmalefashion,3cfg16,I_am_Rude,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"How can you tell?  I thought there was supposed to be a hole punch in the tongue area.  In which case, neither of my 1ks have that, I even looked in inconspicuous areas.  Out of the box, they looked just like firsts do, so I'm not sure if these were even true seconds or just a return, given to STP."
frugalmalefashion,3cfg16,kingzley00,2,Tue Jul 7 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"For Wolverine's and Red Wing you're looking for a punched hole in the tongue. If your Wolverine's don't have a hole in the tongue they were not designated by seconds from the factory. Sometimes stock will be sold as ""seconds"" through STP if the box gets damaged or stock was liquidated for whatever reason. Doesn't actually mean they are seconds though.   A lot of companies do it differently. Allen Edmonds has a variety of markings, Alden stamps an encircled ""R"" on the sole through the logo and stamps the lining as well. Viberg removed the heel pads."

Link -- I definitely wore them after one wash cycle, but I have no comment on if they shrink. The sleeves are a touch too long, but I like to push them up to my forearms anyway. I'm 5'11'' and somewhat skinny with a little bit of muscle. The M size fits me well, for what I want them to do: I'll just wear the shirt with some chino shorts and boat shoes. The fit is loose for a casual summer night out with my buds, and keeps me warm if the temp dips late into the night. The soft wash is very comfortable, but I'll wear an undershirt sometimes anyway.  It is not a slimming or tight fit, if that's what you want. Perhaps consider sizing down. Pure causal, imo.  That all being said, some of the Medium slim fit shirts are just too big for me (of course the S is too small), and others (slim fit) are okay. The slim fit pique polos are too slim, and the regular fit polo are slightly boxy, but wouldn't be a problem if I put on more muscle weight and use an undershirt."

frugalmalefashion,3cfdrv,blades4,4,Tue Jul 7 14:50:54 2015 UTC,Looks like they have a SLIGHTLY different tape at the top if you switch images back and forth. Must be something along the lines of Barney's buying them in bulk and slapping their own brand on them.

frugalmalefashion,3cfdrv,thebarrytone,3,Tue Jul 7 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"I did some research myself and decided against buying them. Many report issues with wearing/creasing in the leather in as little as 5 wears or issues relating to the stitching.  Love the look, but they don't seem to last. I don't think that is acceptable at a $140 price point given we have seen wolverine drop that low recently."

I pretty much just like the color combination, won't wear them too often, and it will serve as a cheap-ish experiment on how long Barney's shoes last.  I just wish I knew if the Grensons fit since I don't want to deal with reselling them if they don't fit."

frugalmalefashion,3caunb,brumbrum21,69,Mon Jul 6 14:51:42 2015 UTC,Not to mention that Amazon doesn't exactly have spectacular BF deals often times.
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,DrSandbags,34,Mon Jul 6 15:21:51 2015 UTC,Last BF I got a pair of Chippewa Apache's for like $80. I was pretty happy with that!
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,Astarlyne,13,Mon Jul 6 15:24:53 2015 UTC,They did some of the best TV deals I've ever seen.

frugalmalefashion,3caunb,Limewirelord,20,Tue Jul 7 00:46:04 2015 UTC,Chromecast is probably more capable than what most smart TVs can do so I'd say you won.
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,MrCrudley,3,Tue Jul 7 01:41:59 2015 UTC,Smart TV functions aren't worth the extra $. Especially if you have an xbox/ps3 hooked up.
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,Dinosaurman,3,Tue Jul 7 12:13:47 2015 UTC,Or even a 35$ amazon fire stick thing.

frugalmalefashion,3caunb,SardonicAndroid,0,Tue Jul 7 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"Wait until black friday or christmas, and if nothing is in your price range try the day after. If they can't clear enough merchandise then, they dump it for really cheap to bring the shiny new models in before superbowl season starts. I didn't bother with camelcamelcamel then, but I have used it for other things and it's nice.  I got mine  technically on Saturday so I think it was the previous year model they really wanted out.

frugalmalefashion,3caunb,nydjason,2,Mon Jul 6 15:57:29 2015 UTC,"Given that Amazon sells pretty much everything and the sale is very non-specific (e.g. an ""anything goes"" type sale) and there will be ""more deals than Black Friday"", and it's several weeks out and probably not everything has been set in stone yet, I find it very unreasonable to expect them to have that information."
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,bamgrinus,18,Tue Jul 7 12:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, similarly to how it was done on Black Friday."
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,fyrril,13,Mon Jul 6 16:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's over a week out. They might release some specifics closer to the date of the sale, but a lot of these will probably be flash sales"

frugalmalefashion,3caunb,fyrril,0,Mon Jul 6 22:02:00 2015 UTC,Anything that Amazon or east Dane couldn't sell or get rid off ends up on myhabit. So usually this sort of flash sale is just a few pieces. You really need to be there and refresh like crazy to get in on the crazy deals.

frugalmalefashion,3caunb,CytochromeC,86,Mon Jul 6 13:49:06 2015 UTC,so basically everyone!
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,zodiacs,170,Mon Jul 6 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Not basically everyone at all. Greather than 50% of my family/relatives are not members of Amazon Prime. I'd venture to say that less than 50% of the U.S. population are Prime members.   According to THIS report, there may only be 30-40 million prime members.  According to THIS census data, there are on average 2.54 members per household in the US.  According to THIS data, there are 321 million people in the US.  Based on this data, we can roughly calculate that every member of the household with a prime account is sharing it with the entire household, and even assuming 50 million prime accounts in the US (the high watermark), that would come out to 127 million Americans with access to Amazon Prime which is about 39.5% of the US population.  So I would disagree that this encompasses ""basically everyone""."
frugalmalefashion,3caunb,CytochromeC,36,Mon Jul 6 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"This is still an insane amount of users. Only 65% of Americans have a smartphone, so around 2/3 of people that can afford a smartphone are also willing to pay for Amazon prime? That is one hell of a monopoly"

The day is 2015-07-15 or 20150715 and according to http://www.datedial.com/datList_Prime_Numbers_Between_Numbers.asp there are no prime numbers in July in 2015.  I think it would have been a cool concept if they actually had a ""prime day"" that throughout history you can look back on that day and it would be a prime day where they did this launch, but it cannot be. If nothing else they just picked the middle of the month (it's exactly centered on the calendar) which, at least, was visually pleasing for me."

frugalmalefashion,3cdb2r,nydjason,2,Tue Jul 7 14:24:37 2015 UTC,The skinny would be mid to low rise. It's a little weird with gap skinny because I got the lives-in chino on skinny and they don't feel skinny at all. You may have to try them first before you buy just to make sure.
frugalmalefashion,3cdb2r,quiquedont,2,Tue Jul 7 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how so many deals on here seem to happen in stores St. Louis locations on the sub.

There seems to be an official ""Sales"" section and then just random items on sale packed right together with new arrivals. You really have to look through the different sections are you will miss some good deals."

They had a lot of them on clearance during the last clear the rack sale at Nordstrom rack for as low as $38 but they are all fit too weird. I guess that's why they're cheap?!
frugalmalefashion,3cd8vo,nydjason,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like theirs is slim fit but fits like the topman Blazers. Maybe other fit differently, but I doubt it. Also, it seems like a lot of it is sold overseas so the sizes are in euro. If you could fit on Gant blazer, I'd recommend them better than topmans because Gant actually uses less poly on theirs as supposed to topman being almost 100% poly non breathable bullshit."
frugalmalefashion,3cccxd,MrT-1000,4,Mon Jul 6 20:26:58 2015 UTC,They also have geobaskets in bone color for like $685a d double zip boots in black for $579. I'm on my phone so I don't have a link. Good deal though if you ask me.

frugalmalefashion,3c72mo,Ashkir,12,Sun Jul 5 14:02:12 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of monthly crates. Some of my friends use them, mostly females. Every month they get a new outfit in the mail complete and they always love it. The few I've seen of men's, I loved. But, here's my biggest issue: Bombfell's average sent to you is $69 a piece with five items. I can't afford to drop $345 a month on a crate if I like everything in it. A complete outfit often times is pants, shirt, sweater, and belt. That's still $276 a month.  I often buy my clothes when things are on extreme sales, like Express I bought several jeans from when they were $15 a piece. I often buy clothes from Target because I have a 15% off permanent pass to Target + a lot of men's clothing is always on clearance. So, that 24.99 shirt I only end up paying something like $9 for.   I don't mind paying a bit more for clothes. But, $70 a piece is hugely expensive for me. I live in a city where the median income, even for college-educated persons, is still minimum wage. I'm shocked to see some people here consider dropping $300 on a new messenger bag or blazer ""frugal"". That is the furthest thing from frugal to me.   Are there any affordable monthly outfit services, that don't cost me half of my entire paycheck? Please let me know, if you know of one."

frugalmalefashion,3c72mo,Pink_Mint,6,Sun Jul 5 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"I think you were probably right. Like, 40% off a Kohls brand is usually still not frugal. 40% off to make it $700 is probably the same idea. But people in this sub tiptoe around prices and ""frugal"" so hard that you can barely even ask for quality and comparisons on high price stuff without getting hounded.     IMO, anything that can't stand a comparison test to a similar or higher quality item at a lower price isn't frugal. That's just objective reasoning. If frugal is based on sale % and an item is compared to itself, then... Well, I guess then marketing tactics have been really effective."

frugalmalefashion,3c72mo,jthotta1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:28:28 2015 UTC,It's still a fairly unreasonable price point outside of rare occasions.  If you'll go up to 30$ the options will open up quite a bit.    But to answer your question try ASOS.  I'd suggest buying the unlimited 2-day shipping if you think you'll use it.  I had it for a year and it was fantastic; their QC is dogshit but with free shipping / returns you can order 3x of the same item and return the ones that don't fit.

frugalmalefashion,3c4dlr,purplefang,-25,Sun Jul 5 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"I simply can't understand why anyone would spend $700, or $400, or even $2,000 on a sneaker.  I can understand spending $300-$600 and up on some beautiful, hand-crafted, goodyear-welted, Italian calfskin or shell cordovan, American, Italian, or English-made dress shoes from a company like Alden, or Allen Edmonds, or Crockett & Jones, or John Lobb, or Gucci for their loafers.  If those go on sale (like with the AE 2nds sale), then they would be of great value, since they are very high quality shoes at excellent prices. Hence, buying them could be frugal.  There is a massive difference between mall-grade, glued-soled garbage from Aldo and Spring and Steve Madden and Kenneth Cole vs. the shoe brands I mentioned. Even Johnston & Murphy offers a significant step up in quality for not much more, and offers real goodyear welts on a lot of models.  But I fail to see how a $700 sneaker from Rick Owens would in any meaningful way be of substantially improved materials and craftsmanship over say, a pair of $100 Adidas Stan Smith's or Converse Purcells.  Yes, buying absolute cheap $15 garbage sneakers is absurd, and the same goes for dress shoes, even up to the $120 Aldo/Kenneth Cole junk level.  But there is nothing wrong with Stan Smith's or the Jack Purcell. They aren't going to fall apart on you in 6 months. Why would anyone pay $700 on sneakers, when for $100-$150 they can get a great pair that is arguably just as well-built?  This strikes me as being akin to paying $500 for a cotton t-shirt just because it says Givenchy or Raf Simons or Balenciaga on it.  How on earth is spending $700 or $400 on sneakers good value, or frugal in any real sense of the word?"
frugalmalefashion,3c4dlr,over-my-head,12,Sun Jul 5 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"As with most items, price scales exponentially against quality. $30 is the difference between Walmart sneakers and chucks, $50 between chucks and stans, $100 between stans and common project, $200 between common project and Yeezies, and the list goes on and on. The difference in quality is huge between Walmart and chucks, but the difference decreases rapidly when you go higher up the scale. It's just the way things are, and at that point, you're paying for  a minuscule difference in build quality but mainly the thought that goes behind the sneaker (and the hype)  It's the same for almost every hobby out there. For biking, Claris is way better than box store gearing, sora much better than claris, tiagra better than sora, 105 better than tiagra, ultegra slightly better than 105, and Dura ace a tad better than Ultegra. For the average rider, tiagra/105 is more than enough, but for the people with money to spend, why not go for Dura Ace or some of the electronic gearing?"

frugalmalefashion,3c4dlr,freudianSLAP,5,Sun Jul 5 02:49:45 2015 UTC,Build quality isn't the end all be all of fashion. If you look at the tech runners on sale it's not too outlandish to consider how one might buy a pair for the silhouette or the types of materials or a host of other reasons. Quality is a huge aspect of the boot world but that's not to say that these Ricks don't have excellent construction also. People pay different prices for different things for different reasons.

frugalmalefashion,3c4dlr,ampersammich,4,Sat Jul 4 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen ""stitched welt"" is purely a marketing term and does not actually pertain to the footwear's construction. A ""stitched welt"" simply means that there is stitching through the welt, whether or not the stitching or the welt is functional is not clarified by that statement. ""Goodyear welted"" is actually much more meaningful in terms of specs and ""stitched welt""=\=Goodyear welted. This could easily be a pre stitched faux welt. Caveat emptor.  If you want to know some methods of determining a faux welt you can see my recent post on the topic in goodyearwelt."

frugalmalefashion,3c2sf4,Red_Stevens,6,Sat Jul 4 09:46:29 2015 UTC,I think they give them oversized shirts. Overall I would say they look slightly below average in muscularity.  And also sticky.......

I opted to buy more made in USA clothing a few months ago and the fact that you are facilitating that process at the price point that you've decided on is nothing short of game changing. So so so cool and in ten years I hope to be shopping at your physical locations.

I have a pair of chinos and the construction isn't the best I've ever seen (loose threads, loose button, etc.) but for the price, I'd say the value is great. I like the styling, it could be a bit more slim below the knee, but I will most likely continue to buy Jomers shorts/pants, so long as my speed is fast enough to snag them."

It's common knowledge that manufacturers come out with a new edition every few years, just rearranging minor details, to force students to buy new and cripple the used book market. DRM is just a more forceful tactic that allows them to leverage new sales annually instead of every 2-3 years, but without necessarily having to change any of the material.   So what if a student gets all the homework from another student, completes it, but can't turn it in because they didn't pay the licensing fee? That's an insane outcome."

frugalmalefashion,3bwx3y,JihadTape,4,Fri Jul 3 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"In the gaming industry it has been shown that time and time again the DRM only hurts the actual buyer. Sure, it makes it less convenient for someone to pirate the game, but sooner or later the DRM gets cracked and the only person stuck with a ""broken"" game is the people who actually paid for it. (Cases where extreme DRM directly influences the game play.)  Most of the time, extreme DRM's and ""first-time"" used code is just the industry trying to tap into the ""used game/book"" market. They don't want people to buy their product used because they don't get a cut out of the used market.  Textbook is a funny business. 12th Edition for the basic chemistry book? it took them 12 tries to get the book right?!

For most of my newer books, the updated questions are available online.    I've been downvoted so heavily in this thread I have a 10+ min wait time to post new comments. So:  @ /u/cobaltorange I'm not okay with that, in fact, I'm pretty much a socialist.  However, I also don't take things that I haven't paid for.  If you don't like the prices, don't use their product.  The end result is the same:    Publishers will get desperate and try to appease the students.   in fact, if everyone stops using their product, the prices will change faster since they won't be jacking up the sales costs on the paying students to cover their losses of non-paying students.  @ /u/dasdo0kie   See my above answer.  I know books are expensive, I've been buying them for over a decade now.  I also know that it's part of the costs of education unfortunately.  The best way to wrangle the costs isn't to pirate though (that just displaces the costs onto others who do pay).     The DRM in textbook world is a lot different because it is a niche market with little to no advertising.  Each book you used probably resourced thousands of studies over decades or even centuries of research.  Not everyone wants those, in fact, few people do.  The incentive to crack the DRM is low in textbook world, and in my experience, the DRM is also much less restrictive. In addition, it is not ""single use,"" I can use my digital textbooks for as long as I have the key.  I guess if I really wanted to I could sell the digital key too.  It's just a string of alphanumerics for some, and for one in particular it's a keyfile.  The professor selling their book, who knows.  That's not really applicable if you ask me.  You did have the opportunity to ask the publisher, and presumably, the editor in person why the book was so expensive.  I imagine at least part of it was printing fees, but who knows really.  @ /u/Frenchcanadian   I'm not sure how that justifies taking something that you haven't paid the agreed price for.  Education is expensive.  Very expensive.  Unfortunately.  We need to change that.  Displacing the costs of the books by a subset of its users not paying just increases the costs for those that are paying if the publisher wants to maintain their earnings.  This is especially evident in a small/niche market such as textbooks."
frugalmalefashion,3bwx3y,French__Canadian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"I guess we are arguing about different things here, but one thing I do want to make clear. Anti-DRM =/= support piracy. I am against piracy except in many niche cases (I don't exactly support it, but in these niche cases, people did it not because they don't want to pay for it, but rather the publishers doesn't have a revenue for certain people in a certain region to pay. Still wrong, but understandable)  Never in my post have I supported piracy, I am just against overly restrictive DRM. We don't know what the particular situation is with OP, so I don't know how restrictive the DRM is. However, the stigma that textbooks are expensive (especially for students with no money) and the fact that they are well known to scramble things to make new ""editions"" to sell more ""new"" copies just sounds money-grubbing. Not only that, they are targeting students who have no choice, professor decides on which books and students buy them. THEN we have these ""one-time"" use ""digital copy"" of textbook that costs the same as regular prints with the sole purpose of stopping used book sales. Here is the problem with selling ""one-time"" used keys, how is there any security in buying these? the person who sold it to you still has the key, for all you know, he just bought it from someone for the price he sold you for! Back in the days with CD keys on video games, store didn't even allow return on opened games, people could've copied the key and return the CD. (Most stores now a day still doesn't allow return on opened games.)  As for the professor, the answer was simple, ""you don't like the price? good don't take my class, there is a wait-list of people waiting for your spot!"" Sheep to the slaughter really.  If you really don't want your books pirated, the best way is to print them, not digitize it. If people photocopy textbooks, making them digital just makes ctrl+C -> ctrl+V so much easier, no DRM's can prevent that.  TL;DR: Anti-DRM =/= support piracy"
frugalmalefashion,3bwx3y,Lindsbeard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"I would love to not have to buy the new edition, except certain professor requires the newest editions. In fact, I would love it to not have to buy ANY books at all, but it is part of the cost of education. I do not know all that much about text books, but pretty much all of the engineering books I had to purchase back in my college days were $300+ USED. I have yet to figure out the justification behind that kind of pricing where every quarter I was paying $800+ on textbooks alone. I even had a professor who put together parts of others works into a pile of stapled papers and were selling those for $120? sure licensing costs an lot of money, but how much exactly? I will never know. I would like to see things like this be more transparent in its costs, for all I know the professor is taking advantage of the students and trying to turn a profit on people who had no choice.  I would love to know how DRM in the digital textbook world is significantly different from other digital products. Sooner or later the DRM is cracked or someone finds a way to get the content out for free. (I have seen people pass around photocopied textbooks back in my days.) Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to stop that. Again, once the DRM is cracked, the only person stuck with a DRM ""protected"" product is the people who actually paid for it. Has DRM successfully stop Kindle piracy? a market not so significantly different from ""other software""? I don't think so. You know why I buy kindle books? First off I love the convenience of my kindle, secondly, kindle books are a fraction of the cost of a paperback, its a win win situation for the publishers.  Piracy is wrong, there are very few cases where piracy can be justified, and I am not trying to argue that. No one should get their work stolen and people should be paying for the content they are using. However, digitalizing and forcing each copy to be used only once just sounds more like them trying to get rid of the used market than stopping piracy. Piracy is way more prevalent in the digital world than actual hard copies of textbooks.  Edit: If I know a way to insure that the content providers always get paid for their work without actually hurting the consumer, I would not be here telling you that, I would be selling that idea to EVERY content creator in this world. However, DRM sounds a good idea, but in practice things like ""you can only install this game 3 times""/""you can only register and use this book once"" straight up hurts the consumer who paid for the product  in how they can legitimately use the product they bought. On the other hand, the content gets out anyways, so the people who pirate the game/book have no restrictions and the actual paid customers get screwed."

I knew that it wasn't shaped to take UK bills but still does the job well as I mostly only use cards. It works well as a card holder, but when I take a couple out for one reason or another it slackens and allows others to slip out easily. I think my solution will be to sew a strip of elastic around it to hold cards in place. I definitely love how thin the thing is though and people always comment on that when I take the wallet out."

frugalmalefashion,3bvpc7,fucky0urkarma,2,Thu Jul 2 17:21:23 2015 UTC,Really? I'd think to size up. A medium Mossimo fits me perfectly.. I don't think a small anything would fit me well because I lift quite a bit and I thought Uniqlo typically ran small being a Japanese company.
frugalmalefashion,3bvpc7,Citizen_V,2,Thu Jul 2 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"uniqlo runs small if you buy from japan like i did (whoops) but the US sizing is consistent with like gap, etc"

frugalmalefashion,3bvpc7,awkwardanimals,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:21:07 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I have no experience with those. Uniqlo has measurement charts on their product pages which have been fairly accurate for the things I've purchased.
frugalmalefashion,3bvpc7,SprezzaBox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:22:36 2015 UTC,I tend to wear a medium in both but they fit a bit differently.  I'd probably check the measurements they give on the website and decide based on that.

frugalmalefashion,3bvpc7,WhosAfraidOf_138,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:54:27 2015 UTC,It's easier for them to make stock in two length sizes  & have in-store tailoring than have to deal with multiple sizes at a time.  You can bring in your Uniqlo jeans to a store & they'll tailor to your length for free. Or you can just get them hemmed yourself.

frugalmalefashion,3bwt1d,killxswitch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:33:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I figured as well. Both mine were MII but were made half a year apart, with one having really torn around edges. Unfortunately, I apehandled the shoe cream, but it otherwise would have distracted from the poor quality. Otherwise, mine are suffering from absolutely horrendous creasing (some from the ungodly amount of shoe cream applied, but it's still clearly obvious that the shoes are creasing hard from barely a few miles of walking).  Further, the build seems to require absurdly ""tall"" feet to fit these shoes properly and prevent creasing (one significantly moreso than the other). If I went up half a size or so, I could probably have crammed insoles to make up for this. Otherwise, creasing is beyond inevitable, as I've seen already.  It's not that easy to tell (or maybe it is) from this picture but the shoe on the right is completely deformed already. In this picture, I have the original tissue stuffed in there to fill them back up again, but they're otherwise completely warped."

frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,LocnarPDX,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"Looks like they changed it to an 8"" inseam to 8.5"" :/"
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,TheConfuzzler,2,Thu Jul 2 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"Take them to the tailor or find someone who can hem, that's what I'm doing. Even at 8"" they're a bit too long for me. I bought shorts from the May drop and will be taking them to the tailor after this holiday weekend."
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,peanutbudder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:57:04 2015 UTC,Good thing for us tall people. I'm 6'4 and while the shorts fit they were pretty slutty.
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,peaheezy,2,Fri Jul 3 14:12:20 2015 UTC,I remember reading on previous threads but should I be ordering my true waist size or should I go w the sizing chart on the website
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,deathbycheezburger,2,Thu Jul 2 22:36:03 2015 UTC,I went with the measurements on the size chart. It looks like they're vanity sized on the tags. The 31 has a 33 inch waist.
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,LocnarPDX,2,Thu Jul 2 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just went with their size chart as well"
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,deathbycheezburger,4,Fri Jul 3 00:12:55 2015 UTC,Not feelin the wide stripe.

frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,Citizen_V,3,Thu Jul 2 21:35:37 2015 UTC,Luckily they aren't selling out in moments like with their planned sales.
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,Citizen_V,2,Thu Jul 2 22:08:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I was surprised when the seersuckers were still in stock when I woke up.
frugalmalefashion,3bwnbs,graps,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:18:17 2015 UTC,I got 2 pairs of their Oxford pants last month and I cannot wait for their wools to come back in the fall. Really quality stuff that I wish wasn't such small batch
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,abovemars,12,Thu Jul 2 14:47:13 2015 UTC,I got these measurements from a J.

frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,fishdontreddit,8,Thu Jul 2 16:31:20 2015 UTC,If they have this info why don't they just post it on their site like Uniqlo does? Mind boggling.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,rrr22777,10,Thu Jul 2 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"If you ever buy something from J.Crew, you'll probably get an email about filling out a survey. Please fill it out and say you'd like to see measurement charts on product pages. I mentioned it in the last survey I filled out and someone from corporate contacted me saying thanks and that they'd pass the suggestion on to the team. Whether she really did is a mystery, but it couldn't hurt if a lot of people started suggesting it."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,oscargamble,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea.  However, I don't ever trust sizing charts, anyway, and one of the main reasons I shop J.Crew regularly is because their sizing is quite consistent.  If I buy something from J.Crew, it almost always fits me well."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,rogun64,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"Damnit. In for one. I've been very curious about the quality of the japanese chambray.   Thanks for posting the measurements. I had a popover before from J.crew last summer in Small and can barely put it on/take it off, but it looked good once it was on lol. (i'm a 38 chest, 160 lbs.)"
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,marcxy,2,Thu Jul 2 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"According to the measurements, the size S shirt here is much bigger in the chest. I went with the XS since the length seems fairly long and these seem better untucked. I'm also size 38 chest. Hope it isn't TOO small."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,fishdontreddit,2,Thu Jul 2 20:43:03 2015 UTC,"Actual chest circumference is 38? That might be too tight. The garment chest measurement should be larger than your actual chest size (by ~2""?). I saw you said you wore S for Uniqlo and J. Crew slim OCBD. Uniqlo says their S has a width of 20 2/3 inch, so that's ~41.2 in circumference. J. Crew's chest measurement is 40.5"" according to this chart. I think you may be better off with the S, even though it's going to be a tad large."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,Citizen_V,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:30:07 2015 UTC,"The popover just came in today. I changed my order to a small and it fits perfectly. Thanks for the tip, you saved me a return!"

frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,Citizen_V,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:30:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go with XS. Putting it on and taking it off will be a pain. You'll run the risk of ripping it.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,marcxy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:46:09 2015 UTC,Well you convinced me to change to an S and I'm glad I did. The S just came in and it fits perfectly. Thanks mate!
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,fishdontreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:30:14 2015 UTC,I tried one on in the store a couple of years ago and it was really large.  It was on clearance and that stopped me from buying it.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,rogun64,7,Fri Jul 3 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"I've had my eye on this shirt for a while now, but it was always too expensive for me. Its on sale now for $40, and the code LONGWEEKEND brings it down to $23.99. $5 shipping though, my order came to $31."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,jinwoot,5,Thu Jul 2 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but if there's an actual J Crew store near you, you can go and order what you need from there and they'll waive the shipping fee if you wanted to save that $5  Oh and in my experience they'll let you use a student discount too (if you are a student), but I think that might depend on the store"
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,recycleourknowledge,12,Thu Jul 2 17:40:27 2015 UTC,The model looks like a vagrant.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,Subalpine,3,Thu Jul 2 14:59:53 2015 UTC,He definitely wouldn't be allowed in your country club!

frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,jinwoot,9,Thu Jul 2 16:09:15 2015 UTC,I like to think of it as a dressed up henley
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,Subalpine,16,Thu Jul 2 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"Give me a polo.   OK, Dad."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,uglychican0,3,Thu Jul 2 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"I like popovers. They seem to be a trendy kind of cool right now and i'll probably trash it in the coming year or two, but it's a cool look my drawstring pants and joggers."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,VacationAwayFromWork,7,Thu Jul 2 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"Wish this wasn't so heavily downvoted - I'd like a discussion on how people feel about this look.  I've got a white linen collarless popover which looks sharp around the pool or on the beach, but I'm not sure adding the formality of a full collar and breast pocket makes sense. For $30 delivered I'll give it a shot and hopefully my ""mismatched"" fears are unfounded."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,SquishSquash81,7,Thu Jul 2 17:08:08 2015 UTC,I probably was too harsh with my wording. Hence the downvotes.  I just think they offer less than a short sleeve button down in the looks and convenience department.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,VacationAwayFromWork,4,Thu Jul 2 17:14:14 2015 UTC,I just think they offer less than a short sleeve button down in the looks and convenience department.   A tempered response haha. Thanks for your reply!
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,rogun64,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:20:59 2015 UTC,I think they're a gimmick.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,Citizen_V,2,Fri Jul 3 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"I like the combination of different levels of formality. I prefer a button-down polo though because I can't get a good fit with popovers. If the torso is slim enough, I can't put it on over my shoulders."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,here_to_fuck_up,3,Thu Jul 2 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"For me, polos will forever look like big-box employee wear. I can't help but see someone in a polo and think they work wherever it is they are standing.   For better or worse, popovers fix that problem. You don't look like you work at best-buy or the sunglass hut."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,rogun64,2,Thu Jul 2 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I agree on polos.  I've always considered them an athletic shirt for tennis.  They should always be mesh and worn in place of a t-shirt.    Now when I wear one, however, I can't help from thinking that I either look like a big-box employee or someone who thinks a polo shirt is fancy.  Ralph Lauren ruined the style for me."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,alphashadow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:54:14 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of the long-sleeve polo. I find it to be a good in-between.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,Brian175,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:47:32 2015 UTC,Did you have a fit pic of that not too long ago? Uniqlo one? Seeing that pic was the only time I had considered getting a popover. Most of the time I think they look odd.
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,hellomisterjedi,2,Thu Jul 2 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can't agree with this sentiment more. The idea of a popover Oxford that is missing more than half of its buttons is slightly upsetting."

frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,bkilaa,3,Thu Jul 2 15:17:57 2015 UTC,"I wear small/medium depending on the brand and style of shirt. In this case, I went with a small, because popovers seem to fit looser and more relaxed. Based on the reviews on their site, a couple people have sized down as well."
frugalmalefashion,3bvlqx,bkilaa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah size down if you want a slim fit. I actually sized up and it looks fantastic. I'm an XS in j crew regular and a S in j crew slim, and got the small.  It has a loose drapey fit that looks great with slim jeans and my Visvim FBTs. I feel like Kanye!"

You will hear it across the room if you place it on a hard surface like a shelf. If it's on your arm, you will hear it if for example your hands are in front of you typing.  Honestly, this isn't a frugal watch, it's just cheap. Save up and buy the $50 Seiko instead."
frugalmalefashion,3bvz2c,niton,10,Thu Jul 2 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add in a dissenting opinion here. I agree that the watch is pretty loud, but that's only if you're in a totally silent room. For example, I put it in a drawer while I'm sleeping and I don't hear it anymore. During the day, though, when you're almost never in totally silent situations, the sound is not noticeable at all (at least not to me) and you get by just fine.   Just my thoughts."

frugalmalefashion,3bvgcl,Davin900,10,Thu Jul 2 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"Hi FMF! I just wanted to put an idea out there and see what people thought...  I work for a non-profit that provides services and shelter to homeless youth in NYC. Specifically, we serve people living on the streets who are under the age of 24.  We're always asking for donations of clothing but have a very hard time getting donations of mens clothing.  That's where you guys could come in...  Would people on this sub have any interest in donating their unwanted new or lightly worn clothing items to kids living on the streets of NYC?  I don't know about everyone else here but I know I end up with a ton of items that don't fit or I end up only wearing once or twice. Our kids would love to have that stuff. They care about looking good just like any other young people.  I messaged the mods about this idea and never heard back so I just thought I'd post in this Q&A thread. I'm also happy to provide any verification about the program.  We would take any types of clothing, really. Casual or dressier stuff for interviews. Basics are always needed. Any sizes are welcome.  And you can write the donation off your taxes!  Please let me know what people think or if this violates any of the subs rules... (I don't think so?)"

We do lots of different programs (domestic violence shelters, child abuse counseling, anti-trafficking intervention) in addition to homeless youth services.

Hello all,  I'm trying to find a pair of slim-fit cargo pants that have fittings such as so (under $50-$40 hopefully), on the model in the link. I like how the pockets are not too puffy looking and how pants fit very slim around the legs (close to how joggers/skinny jeans are, but a lil bit looser).

I've checked sites like old navy, uniqlo, asos, etc. However I am unsure on how slim the (frugal) cargos actually are.  http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=119792062&vid=1&locale=en_US&kwid=1&sem=false&sdkw=mens-slim-fit-military-cargos-P119792&sdReferer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldnavy.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-cargo-pants.jsp   I might consider buying a pair such as those on the old-navy site, but I'm unsure of the fitting.

frugalmalefashion,3bsiep,JackBrush,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:51:49 2015 UTC,What size foot do you have?  I'm a 13 in IRs and worry about the bulbous clown-shoe look of these boots.  Wondering if one is better than the other at large sizes.
frugalmalefashion,3bsiep,ampersammich,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"The toe profile on the wolverines isn't bulbous at all, which the IR's are notorious on MFA for making people feel that way but I never felt that way. Only reason i got rid of them was because of the cork sole, which apparently if i put on half soles and suffered the long ass break in time they would have been magical.  I bought size 12's in the IR's after trying on the 13's. The only real boots I'd worn up to me buying the IR's we're combat boots and I was fairly consistent with size 13's ranging from Danners, Mangums, general issue US, and finally whatever the hell boots I had in the legion.    I ordered my pair of mcCleans in 11.5 as I probably could have dropped to 11.5 in the IR's. Fit damn near perfectly.   I couldn't tell you what my brannock size is though. Last time i was measured i was 12 or so."

frugalmalefashion,3bsiep,ampersammich,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well it's cork vs stacked leather, so naturally the wolverines are more comfortable initially. IRs to wolverines is like night and day.  That being said, from what I understand the IRs can be insanely comfortable after break in (which is a long time. Longer than I had my pair).  Haven't had any pain issues with the wolverines."
frugalmalefashion,3bsiep,JackBrush,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:28:09 2015 UTC,"I've had two pairs of IRs, and even after breaking in they're horrible (I assume because I have high arches).

I just wish I could have the look of the IRs (bulbous toe and all) with the comfort of Timberlands."
frugalmalefashion,3bsiep,ampersammich,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:44:37 2015 UTC,"These aren't bulbous, in fact they're unstructured but they're not to far off of the IRs cap toe. But with them being made to order you could have them do whatever you want."

I have checked these wallets at a store in my neighborhood. Over $100 retail is a joke. But these days, some wallets with lower quality sell for over $200.  Just checked the site and price seems to be about in the $50 range. Good price for their quality.   Overall, Barney's product are nice and quality products.

frugalmalefashion,3br32a,yourfriendkyle,7,Wed Jul 1 16:39:18 2015 UTC,I got 2 pairs of the preppy fit last time and really like the fit and construction. Can anyone who got the jogger shorts offer any insight?
frugalmalefashion,3br32a,nsummy,5,Wed Jul 1 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'm referencing Hollister but I think its probably comparable to AF.  I bought a bunch of the 4.5 in inseam shorts in Large that fit well.  I got a couple of pairs of joggers in with them which were same size but way too tight and had to return them.  Based on this there is probably a significant different in the way the 2 fit.   By the way, any idea what the outseam is on those preppy fit shorts?"

This is that suit.  I got the right size jacket and pants in store for $105 after taxes and it fits great.  Even though it's a poly blend, I was so surprised by the cut that I wore it the next day and got tons of compliments.

I was looking for an alternative for the Tom Ford harrington or the Baracuta G9, and found this jacket. I bought both a small and a medium, and I prefer the fit of the small. The jacket has a tartan lining, and a small Abercrombie logo on the left arm (I removed the patch on my jacket with a seam ripper, and can do the same for you if you'd like).    J.Crew Lightweight Chino - 484 (MSRP: $75) - NWT  Size: 28/32 & 30/30  Color: Navy  Price: $35 + Shipping  Pictures: Navy, Tagged  Color is out of stock on the posted link. These pants fit slim with a moderate taper, but I would suggest sizing down 1 if you want to wear them aggressively slim.    J.Crew 7"" Shorts - Stanton (MSRP: $64.50) - NWT  Size: 28  Color: Cove Blue (Navy)  Price $30 + Shipping  Pictures: Cove Blue, Tagged  Fits slim, great shorts. I have a pair in 29's I haven't worn yet, but I have cut the tags. If you would rather buy that pair I can swap them for the 28's.    J.Crew Thermal Henley (MSRP $59.50) - NWT  Size: Small  Color: Mountain White, Cabernet, & Navy  Price: $40 + Shipping  Pictures:  Mountain White (Tagged) / Cabernet (Tagged) / Navy (Tagged)  Hands down the best henleys I've ever bought. Last season's smalls were a perfect fit, this season's were cut slightly larger. Luckily I found a couple in XS which were a little snug, but as long as I don't toss them in the dryer they fit well. For reference I usually wear an XS in J.Crew's oxfords.    NOTE: If you would like any measurements, additional pictures, or fit pics please feel free to ask."

Hey this is kind of random but I was just at the Burlington Coat factory near my work and found two pairs, one size 10 and the other 10.5, of Allen Edmond Gobi Suede boots for cheap. I didn't have my phone on me (recently lost)  or I would have pictures. I'm not 100% sure they're the Gobi but I'm nearly sure because of the sole. They look nearly exactly like this pair I believe the color is called snuff.   If anyone is interested in me picking them up for you and shipping them (Continental USA) just drop me a msg. If you want them I'm willing to go check to make sure they're available, purchase them, and then get back to you before you pay me. Will be around $175 ppd.   I would have bought them for myself but I wear a 9 or 9.5 in AE, but I did get a pair of the Rogue Captoe Oxford for around $100!"

frugalmalefashion,3bq2ha,Citizen_V,3,Wed Jul 1 15:03:20 2015 UTC,Give the tailored slim fit a try. It has a larger taper than most other brands like Uniqlo and J. Crew. It'll probably still end up being slightly large in the midsection if you have a large drop.

Trying both of them adipowers are superior for powerlifting and just squatting in general. Nike romaleos are even better.   If you missed out on these and are looking for oly shoes I'll tell you that you'll probably never see them go on sale and when they do they sell out immediately. 160 is worth it when you only wear them to squat and they last for years."

frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,ulrikft,6,Wed Jul 1 02:20:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person. Oly shoes lets some peoples hips get lower and their back more upright. Yeah, it is about .5 an inch off the ground, but I haven't heard of anyone saying that .5 an inch makes them miss lifts."
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,cmykevin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:23:49 2015 UTC,"Depends if you're just training for fun or an elite competitive lifter.  Half an inch is a huge distance if you're an elite lifter. If you're training for kicks and giggles and oly shoes let you get into a better position, then wear them.  Are powerlifts only a 1/2"" rise or are they the standard 3/4"" rise?"
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,cmykevin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"For the sake of discussion, do you think that a competitive lifter would value the 1/2 inch more or the better position? I mean, weightlifting shoes is not exactly the same as standing on a .5 inch wood board to deadlift"
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,surroundedbyasshats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on the lifter. Although at the elite level, I can't think of a single person who deadlifts in weightlifting shoes at competition. I know of a few people who train in them occasionally, but they all compete in slippers or chucks.  I don't like deadlifting in my oly shoes because I feel pitched too far forward and can't sit back into the pull enough. I can't sumo deadlift in them at all and feel like I'm going to fall on my face when I try."

frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,saffir,-5,Wed Jul 1 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"These are more for Crossfit than hard powerlifting. They have a much softer heel compared to a hard heel found on powerlifting shoes. That said, I use my oly shoes for deadlifts and I feel perfectly stable in them."
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,ocean_spray,8,Wed Jul 1 01:10:06 2015 UTC,"They will keep you stable, however they make deadlifts harder because of the higher heel. I used them to deadlift though, because changing shoes would allow someone to steal my squat rack. I think investing in some chucks is the way to go for deadlifting."
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,Sportsnincompoop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:26:26 2015 UTC,"Same here, but I've gotten used to compensating with the shoes. It's extra height, but once you break the ground, the stability helps."

In my shoes, I would run for approximately 0 feet before I stopped."

frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,thebla5t,8,Wed Jul 1 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"I know there's a difference. It's not a huge difference at lower weights but as you progress to higher weights, any extra stability goes a long way toward increasing your ability to handle a larger load."
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,PigDog4,3,Wed Jul 1 02:14:50 2015 UTC,You honestly think there is none?
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,thebla5t,-3,Wed Jul 1 01:41:12 2015 UTC,Definitely should. I think Kawowkski or one of them talked about his arches collapsing while pulling 500# barefooted.
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,JerkstoreMD,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"My oly shoes have 0 arch support, so they wouldn't really make a difference.  Also, 500 lbs isn't really that much for elite lifters. Plenty of people on /r/weightroom and /r/weightlifting and /r/powerlifting pull more than that in deadlift slippers or chuck taylors.  Do you mean Kirk Karwoski, the man with a 1000 lb squat, had his arches collapse when pulling 500? That seems...improbable?"
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,PigDog4,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:54:37 2015 UTC,"They absolutely do-- the metatarsal strap supports the arch.  I misremembered, it was Olympic weightlifter Tommy Kono.  He collapsed his arches permanently while squatting heavy barefooted."
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,JerkstoreMD,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:02:44 2015 UTC,I'm confused. How does something that pushes down on the top of my foot support my arch from the bottom? Do you have a link to the story or something? I'd be interested in reading more.  I have very high arches and I really don't feel much arch support from my Wei-Ruis.

frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,anonyjonny,-1,Wed Jul 1 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"You actually think that the strap is serving to push down on the top of your foot?  Your homework is to find a pair of Adipowers or Powerlifts, and fasten the strap.  Pay attention to what happens when you pull the strap laterally/horizontally prior to fastening it in place."
frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,ObsidianOne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"I have a set of wei-ruis. I get a tiny bit of lateral support but it's mostly top-down force. I also have enormously high arches, so that might have something to do with it."

frugalmalefashion,3bobnb,ObsidianOne,2,Fri Jul 3 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"I have to loosen the straps on my wei ruis otherwise the top of my foot starts to hurt.

When I tighten the strap more, the top of my foot starts to hurt and the shoes become very uncomfortable after 5 minutes.  Maybe it's just because my arches are stupidly tall and they work for regular feet. I wouldn't know, I don't have regular feet.  Also, everything I've ever read says the metatarsal strap is designed to increase lateral stability and suck the foot into the shoe. Not to provide support from underneath the arch of the foot.  Since apparently you're better than me at physics, please explain how a force that presses downwards and laterally on an arch could possibly support it."

frugalmalefashion,3bo96a,auf_der_autobahn,2,Tue Jun 30 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"I pretty much wear Cole Haan exclusively, and it's exactly because of what you say, as strange as that is to say.  I get loafers/oxfords/wingtips for around $75/pair on these sales. They last me as long as I need them and I discard them, although I have had one pair resoled, but that was just to see if they would last longer (they did).  I generally wear loafers, and nothing fashion forward, and I like them, though the soles wear quickly if they're not alternated between days.  I have 5 pairs currently, never wear the same pair in the same 5 day span and this set of 5 has been going on a year and a half.  I was previously alternating between about 2 pairs (and 1 other non CH shoe) and the soles wore quickly (though I really liked one pair of CH shoes and they wore out within 5 months)."
frugalmalefashion,3bo96a,plausible-rationale,3,Wed Jul 1 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Almost only wear Cole Haan, mostly loafers, drivers and Oxfords. They do wear in some, but the fit is great for a wide fit, and I get them on sale for $40-$80 at most, good value/quality/style ratios."
frugalmalefashion,3bo96a,pivoprosim48,2,Wed Jul 1 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"I echo /u/plausible-rationale's sentiments almost exactly. Cole Haan has the nicest loafers in the sub 100-ish price range, IMHO.  I have two pairs that I rotate basically every day unless I'm doing something active.   They last about a year and a half and that's fine since I'm hard on shoes in general. I don't use shoe horns with loafers and I slip em on and off throughout the day, which has hard on the back part of the  shoe (backstay? heel tab? idk). I just got a pair resoled to see if it's worth it. I dont know if i'll do it again. The leather lasts longer but it's not much more money to get a brand new pair of shoes. I'm torn.   Still waiting on a good price on those single monks or some tasteful loafers w/ the lunargrand / zerogrand soles.  edit: oh dang they kinda on sale again. double monks too. never see them cheaper than this unfortunately"
frugalmalefashion,3bo96a,ilovedonuts,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:24:35 2015 UTC,The suede and leather aren't great. The soles on the LunarGrands are pretty comfortable. I would only recommend buying them at a discount. Not worth 200+ but 140 is reasonable.

frugalmalefashion,3bnazc,SchoolCat,2,Tue Jun 30 21:37:05 2015 UTC,Unbranded or naked and famous denim. Thanks!
frugalmalefashion,3bnazc,Maasharu,0,Mon Jul 20 09:50:14 2015 UTC,Seconding this! even though i could easily check for myself
frugalmalefashion,3bnazc,cobaltorange,2,Tue Jun 30 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly a noob when it comes to raw denim. I'm just looking for a good brand, that's inexpensive for a college student.  Thanks!"

frugalmalefashion,3bnazc,PM_ME_A_DOLLAR_PLS,3,Wed Jul 1 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"I have a size 10.5 all black that have never been worn if anyone wants them for $40 shipped. I didn't try them on in store because they were so cheap, turns out (in my opinion) they run a little large, so my size 10 foot doesn't fill them out properly."

frugalmalefashion,3bnazc,thirsty_moore,2,Tue Jun 30 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"Some people disagree, but I want to say these run about a half size small. I do 11 in USA Nb's; 10 in CDB's; 10.5 Quoddy, but Stan's feel a bit small in 11's."
frugalmalefashion,3bnazc,repthrows,2,Tue Jun 30 19:01:47 2015 UTC,I think they're True To Size. I'm a size 8 on the Brannock device and wear a size 8 stan smith

frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,hereforemore,3,Wed Jul 1 02:18:50 2015 UTC,how's the fit on the chore coats?
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,hissingelephant,6,Tue Jun 30 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"Here's my fit pics. I'm 5'9"" and was 150 lbs at the time. I sized down and bought an X-small.  The jacket fits fine if I keep it unbuttoned, but is borderline too tight if I button it up all the way. That problem is mitigated by not buttoning the top/bottom button.  If you want your chore coat to be fitted and don't plan on layering too much, size down. If you want a looser fit and plan on layering something like a sweater underneath, go true to size."
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,bmk_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:18:35 2015 UTC,What is your chest size?
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,hissingelephant,2,Tue Jun 30 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"35-36"""
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,bmk_,2,Tue Jun 30 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, guess I'll go with my usual size."
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,antiquesofa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'11 ~140 lb, should I go with the small just for length? I usually wear an xsmall or small."
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,antiquesofa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:13:31 2015 UTC,I would. You can wash these on hot and get some shrinkage if you need it.
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,clownycashew,0,Tue Jun 30 19:22:41 2015 UTC,Ok thanks
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,Citizen_V,3,Tue Jun 30 19:52:36 2015 UTC,I wear a medium and I was told to size down but a small was way too snug so unless you are pretty scrawny I recommend your regular size.
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,clownycashew,3,Tue Jun 30 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm hesitant to wear my small because of how snug it is. At least with a medium, I could have washed with hot water to shrink it if I needed."
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,SloeGin,2,Tue Jun 30 19:24:56 2015 UTC,And I couldn't layer anything except a thin button down or a tee
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,BaggySpandex,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:46:35 2015 UTC,Really curious on this as well. I know the sizing is always discussed but I'm so unsure if I really need to size down to an x-small or not due to height/arm length.
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,Phobos1393,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:48:59 2015 UTC,Interested as well. Would prefer a closer fitting chore coat.

frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,Dontouchmyficus,3,Tue Jun 30 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say you're a medium, not a small."
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,CPR_Dummy,2,Tue Jun 30 21:05:58 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for checking for me.  I ended up getting a medium/tall!
frugalmalefashion,3bnf64,ElPinkerton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:32:14 2015 UTC,What height justifies the small/tall option? I'm 6'0 and weigh 150lbs. Size suggestions?

frugalmalefashion,3bmyej,CarlWheezer,2,Tue Jun 30 16:12:46 2015 UTC,The Wavefarers are the best board shorts I've ever owned simply because of the hip pocket.  Every other pair I have has the pocket in inconvenient locations.  I would pick these up but it doesn't look like these are the stretch version.
frugalmalefashion,3bn0t7,PopTartCrust,6,Tue Jun 30 15:11:30 2015 UTC,Good deals here. But not the best. Pricing is still pretty reasonable.
frugalmalefashion,3bn0t7,doedude,2,Tue Jun 30 16:08:48 2015 UTC,Agreed.  If these were sub-100$ I'd have bought a few popovers.  I love GBV stuff but it does pop up around the 80$ mark reasonably often.  edit:  that trippy check shirt may make my change my mind though.  I love it.  Very subversive take on the standard ginghambro shirt.  $120+ is so spicy.
frugalmalefashion,3bn0t7,bamgrinus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's about a million different stores that carry GBV, so you'll probably see better closeout deals elsewhere.  I like GBV's style, but I just can't justify anything near their full retail."
frugalmalefashion,3bn0t7,mgbesq,3,Tue Jun 30 18:22:35 2015 UTC,I wear GBV's almost exclusively and I built that wardrobe almost entirely off eBay in the $30-$50 range.

I think i sized up that case but I'll double check when I get a chance. So essentially 32x32 in gap lived in slims but went with 33x34 with uniqlo should have gone with 32x34.

frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,Ichikasuto,18,Tue Jun 30 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"This was posted a while back at $30, which is a good value.  I own the black ones, which are solid ~12-14 oz, but word of warning don't fade much at all after months.  Still, $15 is a pretty crazy price for these.  I have a review in the works, but didn't want you to miss out if your size is available.    **Edit - I'll post some fit pictures in a bit.  31x34, 155 lbs, 6' tall  ****  Here's a fit picture from a review I have upcoming"
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,Wolves01,4,Tue Jun 30 03:43:15 2015 UTC,What's the fit like in comparison to Levi's?
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,crewnex,5,Tue Jun 30 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"Wondering as well, specifically 513s."
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,fuckbrocolli,4,Tue Jun 30 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"I find that these fit very similarly to 513s - maybe a touch smaller leg opening, but definitely not as small as 511s/510s."

frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,hairlesswhiskers,15,Tue Jun 30 00:43:05 2015 UTC,I wear Levi 511s and wasn't able to fit into these without looking like I was wearing leggings
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,crewnex,10,Tue Jun 30 05:07:09 2015 UTC,"I think you must have gotten the wrong size then. I have a pair of Rigid Dragon 511s in 31x30 and Uniqlo slim straights in 31x32. My Levis are definitely tighter and more tapered compared to my Uniqlo pair. The cut on Uniqlo's pair is very strait with wide leg openings.  It's also possible the cuts are just off, as Levis is known to have poor QC."
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,tyler134,9,Tue Jun 30 00:48:54 2015 UTC,I second this. I wear 511s and the legs are much wider on the Uniqlo pair.
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,lengfdm,2,Tue Jun 30 01:53:40 2015 UTC,Thirded. Exact same experience here. I'd say my Uniqlo slim-straights are pretty similar to my 513s.
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,dynam0,2,Tue Jun 30 05:21:11 2015 UTC,I think these would be Levi's 510 or 511.  Uniqlo's slim fit chino's fit me just fine but these felt shrinkwrapped to my legs.
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,lengfdm,14,Tue Jun 30 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"I don't agree, the leg opening is too wide compared to both 510 and 511. I would say the skinny tapered fit is more like the 511 and 510. Just because it's tight in the thighs doesn't mean it's tight everywhere else."
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,SuperXISM,3,Tue Jun 30 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"So if I wear 511s, would the waist be about the same size? Since they're so cheap I might just go to my tailor and get them tapered there..."

frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,crewnex,2,Tue Jun 30 02:16:05 2015 UTC,"I will concur with this. I sized up to a 33 from a 32 after initially trying them on in store. I may have accidently dried them once and couldn't wear them anymore the leg was so tight. EDIT: I still must admit, this is a slammin' deal. I would recommend sizing up 2 waist sizes."
frugalmalefashion,3bkozm,GuardianDuo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:08:14 2015 UTC,I agree. Mine only fit after dropping 10 lbs and they're still snug AF. Love them and hopefully they'll break in over time.

For soft leather shoes, split-toe is probably better, while full-toe is better for heavier leather shoes, if it fits properly. Split-toe can better accommodate odd widths (narrow or wide) because of its design. In general split-toes seem to be more versatile. It seems some argue that there's not a significant difference between the two types since they're all just generic shoe trees; only a lasted shoe tree (i.e. one made for your shoe) will be significantly better."

For what it's worth, the FUN/HOLIDAY codes are good for Gap and Old Navy as well, and worked with some mixed and matched items in my cart.  So my Banana Republic items counted toward the $50 minimum for the free shipping, and I was able to include a few items from Old Navy to tag along for very low cost.  Specifically, the gray slim fit linen shirt (here: http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=1010012&vid=1&pid=369126032) came to $11.37 after sale, discount, and free shipping.  The other colors would be more, but all are a good bit under $20, which seems like a great price for a linen blend shirt to me.  It might be hard to get over the $50 minimum with just Old Navy alone, but there's a good selection of well-priced stuff that you can bring along for the ride with a Banana Republic order."

The jeans are amazing and well worth it from grab bags like this.  I feel they are losing their focus now making shirts, belts, aprons, wallets, water bottles and now overpriced shoes.    The only time I would shop now is for the grab bag. Anything else is far too expensive for my tastes (I used to buy pairs for 80 and now they are 150 or more) The last grab bag they sent me the perfect jean in the wrong size.  I shipped it back and then they sent me a pair similar to others I own it was a letdown.   To summarize, worth a couple of grab bags and not much else."
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,GoChaca,2,Tue Jun 30 19:26:23 2015 UTC,If I'm a 32 in uniqlo slim selvedge do you think I'm a 32 here too? Or more like a 33-34 (based off of comparing size charts)
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,abovemars,3,Tue Jun 30 19:36:45 2015 UTC,honestly it doesn't work like that with gustin. They use a ton of fabric and they all fit really different. I have 4 pairs of 38 and they all fit different. 1 is big 2 are true to size and one is really small. 2 gained an extra inch of give and one pair has none. It is all different.
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,Kingofthegnome,3,Tue Jun 30 19:54:41 2015 UTC,I have never worn uniqlo jeans before.  Iwill tell you however they are true to size. Measure a comfy pair of jeans you own like Gustin recommends.  Their sizing will be spot on to your measurements.  They might be a bit snug but after a couple of wears they will stretch out.
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,GoChaca,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:14:20 2015 UTC,I'm a huge gustin fan with 7-8 pairs of jeans and 4 shirts. I think I like their shirts more than I like their jeans. Slim Large just fits me so well.  I wish they made short sleeve shirts.  The only time I had a problem with theirs was was when I ordered the grey silk. The fabric had somehow shifted and the crease of the jean was uneven down my leg on one side. It was a shame because I really wanted that fabric. After going back and forth with customer support I was issued a store credit.
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,Wheaties466,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:19 2015 UTC,I might give the shirts a shot sometime but are they really thick?  I am always warm and I love in Los Angeles. Thick shirts are not my friend.    They do make short sleeve t shirts.  The colors are always just a bit too out there for me.  I have a store credit so when they come up again I will pick them up.
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,GoChaca,2,Wed Jul 1 16:51:02 2015 UTC,I live in FL and while I really do not wear them in the summer I have no problem any other time of the year.
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,Wheaties466,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:43:16 2015 UTC,I will give one a shot from the grab bag.  IT will make a good winter shirt.  Thanks!
frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,GoChaca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:21:50 2015 UTC,back in the day their jeans were all 81+ and some pairs in the 160$ range. So for $75 and no wait it was a really really great deal. Since the raw fad is dwindling most pairs they sell are 75-125. So for the 75$ you avoid the wait but the odds of you getting a super nice pair are slim.

It was my fault, my ego wanted me to order a size 33 but I really shouldve gotten 34.  I just asked nicely for a refund instead of credit since and they gave me.  I've contacted the on multiple occasions and theyve always been nice and super helpful.  People just get upset because they size wrong then cant exchange for a different size because no extras were made, so they get pissed even though they should know that going in"

frugalmalefashion,3bnm6e,SaltyBoner,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"I got my first pair through the most recent grab bag (end of June). Got the #154 Japan Royal Indigo, but with a different selvedge ID: https://www.weargustin.com/store/1432  Instead of the rainbow, mine came with a blue line - which I personally prefer since it is more subtle (pics: http://imgur.com/a/Wj3Wa#0). I ordered skinny 30, fits me quite well. I am 5'7"", 135lbs, normally wear pretty fitted jeans with slim silouette leather chukkas/boots or vans authentic. The denim fabric is fairly starched and feels crisp but on the light side, and is wearing in fine (3 days so far). I can tell it's pretty inked up, bleeding quite a bit...excited to see how they fade.   All in all, very happy with the purchase. Prior to this, I've also worn raw selvedge from Uniqlo (slim straight 29) and Naked & Famous (skinny guy 29), both of which felt quite too baggy everywhere. Gustin skinnys feel much more fitted, and the leg opening is still wide enough to sit over my shoes (I'm just getting into the sub-7"" tier). Can share fit pics if anyone is interested, just lmk."

frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,Mumbojmbo,8,Mon Jun 29 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"Anyone with experience with the True to Cast brand?  They're relatively new; thinking about trying out their raw denim  EDIT: Just went to the Atrium NYC store on Broadway to try them out. Decent quality Cone raws for $39. Rise is mid-to-high like Levi's 501. Thigh is slim, but not skinny. Leg opening is pretty tapered, almost like a 511 leg opening, maybe like the old 508s. It felt similar to the Unbranded Tapered fit, but more tapered on the leg opening. I got my size in Unbranded tapered. The high rise helps if you have some flab you want to cover. Awesome for me. Didn't have my size in store, so I just went online to order. Also, theyre a regular Indigo color, not black (like I thought). I actually think they're pretty decent if you want starter raws or ones you want to experiment on. And I think they're sanforized, but couldn't tell.   Also, if you are by the Broadway store, a lot of stuff is on sale for 75% off, not just denim. Check it out. Lots of Nudie and N&F (mostly Super Skinny for $59) and a lot of that TTC stuff."
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,ajenius620,4,Mon Jun 29 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"Not much showed up on Google, I'm afraid it's gonna be one of those house brands always on ""steep"" discount kind of like how Urban Outfitters or Jackthreads does it."
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,deviantzen,2,Mon Jun 29 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"The True to Cast brand is a private house brand by Atrium that started in Fall 2014, but by feeling the stuff they had in store, it's pretty good quality.  I think the indigo raws are the only thing that's a steal at $39, while the other denim is just good at the sale price.  I didn't really check anything else out from TTC though."

Not many people were in there, but more will during rush hour. A bunch of things were getting snatched up already, but maybe they'll still be there later? The things on sale all ring up as 75% off the tag MSRP, and not all the marked down prices on the tag were updated, so you may need to do the math yourself."

I have jeans that are supposed to be slim, but seem more skinny to me; they cause that clown shoe effect when I wear boots with them.  Also, should I size up? I usually wear 28/29. I know raw denim is prone to shrinkage."
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,cobaltorange,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:49:41 2015 UTC,"I would get your size, and if you're in between sizes, get the lower one.  Raw denim will shrink in hot water if unsanforized.  These felt like they were sanforized, or pre-shrunk.  They shouldn't shrink that much, but they should stretch a little with wear.  Since nobody's had experience with these, as a general rule of thumb, sanforized raws will not shrink that much in the wash, but if they do, they will stretch back out.  How much it will stretch will depend on the brand.  Even without washing, these should still stretch somewhat while breaking them in.  But don't rely on my word on this..."

frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,OneHorseMan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"I grabbed a pair too, I'm going to guess for 50 bucks the quality is really good. It looks like there is a margom sole on these, which has to be stitched on the shoe, and that alone costs more on the production end.   Wouldn't be surprising at all of these were made in Europe by a shoe maker that makes a lot of other high end European sneakers. GREATS does the same thing and uses a nice leather and margom sole and they are assembled in a factory that makes other luxury sneaker brands. The leather probably isn't amazing but I bet it is at least as good as the stuff brands like GREATS use."
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,IThinkImAContra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I was a little scared at first, but you've convinced me. I've been meaning to get a pair of shoes that look like this so if the quality is good for the price, I'm going to be very happy (provided that they fit well too). I've spent over $150 on this sale so far when I wasn't even expecting to spend a dime at first. Oh well."
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,HeroWeNeed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:11:22 2015 UTC,"I've learned the quality of stuff is often almost entirely dependent on where it is made. If these shoes are made in shops that are used to making other luxury shoes, the quality is bound to be good.   The easiest analogy I can think of is grey goose vodka and Costcos Kirkland vodka. The Kirkland vodka is made by the same producers of grey goose, so the alcohol is literally equivalent quality with a lesser markup because the lack of recognized branding. I would bet these shoes are about the same, leather is probably fairly nice and they use the high end outsole, but the shoe has zero brand recognition. Fine with me though! Quality > Branding always"
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,IThinkImAContra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:26:26 2015 UTC,"Fine with me though! Quality > Branding always   I agree 100%. Very interested in seeing how these turn out. Quick question, though: if I normally wear a 10-10.5 in sneakers and 9.5 in Clarks Bushacres, you think a 44 would do fine here? I'm worried I may have chosen the wrong size and debating whether to email their CS as there's no easy way to cancel these."
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,HeroWeNeed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:13:00 2015 UTC,"So my experience with sneakers with this particular type of sole is that they generally run large. I would definitely get a 43 if I was in your place. I have no idea how these will actually fit, but every single one of my shoes that came with a margom sole fit large. I'm normally a 9/9.5 and I have a pair of filling pieces that I got in a 41, which equals like 7.5, and they fit me perfectly. So if you have to option to size down, I would go for it.   Almost all my shoes are a 9.5, but I order this pair in a 42 = 8.5/9"
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,IThinkImAContra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll definitely give them a call later today. It's great that you have a pair of FP because I have a question for you - I have a few pairs of filling pieces Mountain boots sitting around that I mean to sell over on ebay because they fit way too narrowly (I got them without checking because they were on such a good sale). I've got both a size 42 and size 43. Length-wise, even the 42 seems like it should fit, but I just can't put my feet in them at all and I don't have extremely wide feet (Bushacres fit just fine), but I do have some trouble fitting into some flat canvas sneakers (i.e. Converse).  How do you expect these to fit in comparison?"
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,HeroWeNeed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:04:03 2015 UTC,"From what I hear about FP, and a lot of brands that use these margom soles in general, the sizing is often dependent on the upper. Like a 41/42 share the same size outsole, if you look on the sole a lot of times you'll see both numbers, but then for the 42 FP adds more space in the upper portion. Does that make sense? So in this case, it's likely the 42/43 share the same length as far as the sole goes, and then the 43 has more room in the upper. These shoes might be similar if the soles are indeed margom, and they definitely appear to be but I can't be 100% sure until I see the bottom.   Also, what mountain cuts do you have in a 42 haha"
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,IThinkImAContra,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:42 2015 UTC,Thank you! I bought the cone pants linked above as well. It just looked too good with the picture lol. I'll just have to get it hemmed.
frugalmalefashion,3bj1wb,ninjames,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly at 40 bucks, that's a good price for ANY selvedge. If these are actually sourced from Cone mills, that is a steal. I got some Volcom selvedge denim, and their whole schtick was they used the extra selvedge denim other big companies ordered from cone mills. So in effect, I had Volcom branded selvedge, but they were made in the U.S. out of premium cone mill selvedge, and the denim quality showed."

If you search, for example, for the style number for the curry colored ones (which aren't described as tapered at Macy's), it will lead you to a dockers page (though not US) that includes pairs from both groups on the Macy's website.  So the curry pair at Macy's (447150234) shows up here as ""Slim Tapered"" (unlike on the Macy's site), as does the gravel pair (447150006) which Macy's does have labeled as tapered.

First, the lived in slim waist measurements are a bit wonky (which isn't really a fit problem, but more of a buying online for the first time problem. In most pants (Alpha's, Aidens, etc.) I wear 28"" waist. The lived in slim 30"" waist can at times be too small for me to wear.  But as far as actual fit I have two (connected) problems with the lived in slim. First, the seat tends to be a bit tight. Second, I get a decent amount of pocket flare with the lived in slim (BR aidens as well). Pocket flare is annoying and doesn't look great.

You're probably getting downvoted because you're an asshole who doesn't seem to know the definition of frugal.   Seriously though, what are you, 12?  What kind of adult resorts to name calling?"
frugalmalefashion,3bemcl,HalfGingGhost,-5,Mon Jun 29 16:30:01 2015 UTC,You honestly must be blind. And do you have dementia? You asked me 3 times if I know what frugal means. And I do. Wasting $150 on a shitty android watch is not being frugal. It's flat out being stupid. Based off of your opinion everyone should just be shopping at Walmart cause fuck fashion it's all about being frugal.
frugalmalefashion,3bemcl,IGotEm,2,Mon Jun 29 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"How am I blind? Because I find the apple watch to be ugly with an ugly interface? What makes your opinion so much better than mine? Yes, because buying a $400+ watch isn't being frugal. In any sense of the word. It defeats the purpose of this thread. And I'd like to know how it is a shitty android watch? Because Apple didn't make it? Where did I say it is all about being frugal? Wait, I didn't. As far as I was aware, this thread is about finding the middle ground between frugal and fashionable. Seriously. There is a reason all of your comments are getting so many downvotes."

frugalmalefashion,3bdvqu,andyrawrs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:39:17 2015 UTC,"When it comes to pricing, I don't agree with this.  Try to do a price match that's not going for full MSRP or sold at something like Neiman Marcus, or sold on their site in one color but not the other, and see how well that goes. Price adjustments are essentially price matches, though from their own company so it varies.  When it comes to returns, yes they are outstanding."
frugalmalefashion,3bdvqu,jhnkango,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:50:37 2015 UTC,They have limits.  They sent me an incorrect Barbour jacket (Bedale instead of Beaufort - the plastic said Beafort but a Bedale was inside). When I wrote them they had went out of stock of the Beaufort. I asked for a discount on the Bedale because I did like it well enough. They said no way and in fact if it would have been more expensive than the Beaufort I would have needed to pay the difference to keep it.  It was pretty weird.
frugalmalefashion,3bdvqu,fashnewb,2,Mon Jun 29 05:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was an odd thing to say. If the jacket had cost $100 more dollars than what I ordered...I probably wouldn't have written them. o_O"

I ordered four pairs to make sure I can pick one that doesn't have significant defects. The salesman at the AE store won't be happy when I return three out of the four, but if they have a problem with that, they should change their policy. I'm not going to pay $200 for seconds without any idea of what the defect is. Anyways, I digress. I'll still be interested to see what the Nordstrom sale will include in case none of these seconds works out.  Thanks."

frugalmalefashion,3bdpai,Solarin88,11,Sun Jun 28 06:19:04 2015 UTC,"Kind of a weird selection here.  A lot of these, I think, are Nordstrom exclusives.  Most of the loafers are ones that are made in the Dominican Republic, so keep that in mind before you decide that they're a bargain."
frugalmalefashion,3bdpai,bamgrinus,3,Sun Jun 28 08:59:27 2015 UTC,Looks like a decent Strandmok alternative. Anyone know the difference between the two?   edit : Great info from both/all.
frugalmalefashion,3bdpai,BaggySpandex,3,Sun Jun 28 14:21:12 2015 UTC,The Elgin was discontinued a year or two ago I think. They're closer to the McTavish than the Strandmok (in terms of leather and lining).  Some discussions on other fora: AAAC and Dappered
frugalmalefashion,3bdpai,porphyrio,3,Sun Jun 28 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"The Elgin was one of the two original shoes that came out a few years ago with their rough collection, before it expanded further. The other shoe was the McTavish, which everyone here probably knows about. The Elgin is a beautiful shoe, and essentially a rough version of the Strand. For whatever reason, I think the Strandmok is terribly ugly, but I think the Elgin is a great looking shoe. I would take the Elgin over the Strandmok any day.   As far as differences, I believe the Elgin has a more structured upper, and it has the double leather sole (maybe the Strandmok is double too?).  I'm on my phone right now and it's difficult to look some of that stuff up. Either way, if the Elgin is available in your size, and you were considering the Strandmok, I would easily take the Elgin okay in a heartbeat."

frugalmalefashion,3bbtkr,cobaltorange,2,Sat Jun 27 20:08:35 2015 UTC,They're very close to the cdbs but have a rubber sole vs crepe so it's better in the rain. Some say the leather is better on the cdbs but I don't see too much of a difference. Hit them with mink oil then a hair dryer and you'll be good to go.
frugalmalefashion,3bbtkr,ZackMorris78,4,Sat Jun 27 20:44:24 2015 UTC,Please be aware that Mink oil will change the aesthetic of the beeswax leather pretty significantly.   I personally prefer the beeswax color unaltered. Bickmore Bick 4 has been great for me with conditioning leather without changing the color.
frugalmalefashion,3bbtkr,BaggySpandex,4,Sat Jun 27 21:13:56 2015 UTC,How about Snoseal?
frugalmalefashion,3bbtkr,BaggySpandex,2,Sat Jun 27 21:33:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does darken them, almost makes it closer to the cdb color, and I really like the luster of the oil. But yeah if you want to keep the original color your product is great."

Friends who have the Buschacre 2's and original CDB tell me their Buschacre 2's synthetic soles last longer than the real crepe soles on the CDBs.  Other tips: CDBs usually run a size larger, so order a size smaller than you usually wear. Wear thick, high socks with them when you're breaking them in (takes about a week) to prevent chafing on your heels.  Picked up my first pair of Beeswax Buschacre 2's just now. So excited."

I haven't been overly impressed by any of the above mentioned brands but I would say that I am most happy with Massimo Dutti (I bought pants) for at least being wearable after a over year's worth of use. My Mango shirt from the same time frame is no longer wearable for most practical applications.

All factory inventory is likely on Shoe Bank as well, and Shoe Bank includes store inventory, so less inventory is available via this sale.   Advantages of this sale over Shoe Bank: (1) The two times I received seconds from the factory warehouse, shoe bags were included (YMMV, in that you may or may not receive bags, but you definitely won't when purchasing seconds from store inventory).  (2) The AllenEdmonds.com site processes credit cards, so no need to call or e-mail.  Disadvantage: The items are in the warehouse, so you can't have an associate check or send a picture of the actual shoe."

Edit: Nevermind, found a few others that I liked and ordered. Let me give you guys a pro tip; order at least more than 1 quantity of the same pair so you can pick and choose which ones you want to keep and return the ones that don't suit your looks.  Example: Wanted the MCallisters (just one pair, but ordered 3 to pick which seconds has the least defects, then return the other 2 pairs) and did the same with 2 other shoes."

frugalmalefashion,3b7b1e,munkeymunkeymunkey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Last year, they only had the ""Allen Edmonds (Players)"" and no PA/Strand or MCallisters on Sale. I was really looking to purchase MCallisters and pretty much waited until now.  I would say, order the seconds (before they are sold out) and probably wait until a few more weeks for Nordstrom sales to see what variety of AE shoes will be up this year.  This way, if nothing come up on the sale, at least you have the seconds. Some people usually find something at Nords and then wait to return their purchase to keep quality 1sts.   I don't like doing returns, but to play it safe I would purchase the seconds (hold on to them and not wear them yet) until Nords has their sale to see what they have to offer this year.  It's practically a win-win for me as well as anyone that's just trying to find deals."
frugalmalefashion,3b7b1e,SchoolCat,2,Sat Jun 27 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"Excellent idea. I'm looking for Strands so planned on waiting, but now I'll get some. How long do I have to return seconds? How do they verify their wear if they will possibly already have creases etc?"

I trust AE customer service and I don't ever hesitate purchasing from them."

I bought these about a year ago in a different leather and the boot has easily become one of my favorites.   $375 is a lot for pretty much everyone outside the footwear addicts in /r/goodyearwelt but this is a very solid price for an even better boot."

Their profile is unlike many others.  If I wasn't tapped out this year, I would absolutely be in on these, but the shell Dundalk GMTO did me in."

The silhouette of the Dundalk is much slimmer and doesn't come off as a work boot.  They look great with slim/tapered pants and 511 would work great with them.  I'm just not sure if you're wearing a casual or business casual attire.  That's what I'd factor in choosing which color, but both will work with black denim  Some pictures for reference"

Uhhhh... sure.  I actually just recently emailed a rep about the JCrew Factory chinos that I got on sale for $20.  Exact same measurements and materials.  She said the only difference is that the JCrew mainline ones were washed once first softness.  I'm pretty sure I'm willing to wash a pair of pants once to save $60.

A 39.5"" garment chest (not person's chest measurement) is about 2"" or so slimmer than most slim mediums that I've seen.

My upper arms are about 13"" around (unflexed), so they fit pretty tight to my arms.  Of those listed, I've only had J. Crew. I would say the quality is very much comparable to the J. Crew. Other brands of polos I have: Fred Perry M12, Brooks Brothers slim fit, and PRL custom fit. The FP M12 is decidedly my favorite: very careful stitching and noticeably thicker than any other mesh polo I have with a nice, tightly woven collar and arm bands. All the others aren't very distinguishable from one another, IMO. The Lands' End are probably the best bang for your buck, though. None of the others get as low in price.

frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,Micrafone_AssAssin,3,Thu Jun 25 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"I had my Rodina for under a year, approx 9 months I think, and it just one day stopped ticking.  I was hanging with some friends, checked my watch, and it wasn't working.  Besides its' mysterious death, I loved the thing.  I bought it holding the position I would never buy a Nomos because I thought ""hey I can just buy a Rodina to test out if I like it, it's the same thing"" but turns out the design is amazing.  Works with t shirt and shorts all the way up to a suit and tie.  I absolutely loved it.  Definitely buying a Nomos when I have the money to."
frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,ashoelace,2,Thu Jun 25 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not the same person but I've had a Rodina for almost a year. Sometimes the second hand stops moving and I have to smack it for it to get unstuck.  I think if you REALLY like the Nomos look and don't want to drop $1.5k on a watch, then it'll probably satisfy your itch. Otherwise, I think the quality is fairly poor for the price point. You can get much better automatics (like the Bambino here!) for that amount of money."
frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,Hitari0,2,Thu Jun 25 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, didn't come across this issue when I was looking up the Rodina.  I really like the minimal bauhaus style face but I guess I'll keep looking since I'm not trying to drop $1500 on a watch right now."
frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,ashoelace,3,Thu Jun 25 22:16:35 2015 UTC,You could look into the Bambino Version 3. It just came out.
frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,riseofr1ce,3,Thu Jun 25 22:29:48 2015 UTC,I would love the bambino 3 if only the hands weren't stupid rectangles. I wish they kept the slick sword hands from version 1 & 2.
frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,spanthe_ocean,3,Fri Jun 26 06:13:04 2015 UTC,"How about the Tisell ones? Similar, just with a Korean company instead - hopefully with better QC!"
frugalmalefashion,3b2p82,bensonator,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:45:08 2015 UTC,Tisell makes a very similar Bauhaus style watch. The main difference style wise is a sweeping seconds hand instead of a sub dial for the seconds. It also has a miyota movement which should be much more reliable than the sea-gull movement in the Rodina.   I have a Rodina and have not had any problems with it in the year or so that I've had it. If I didn't already have it I would probably go for the Tisell instead tho.

I didn't end up having to pay any customs charges on it.   The package was sent from the US to a warehouse in Germany, where a new shipping label was attached. It then came to me in the UK. As far as customs were concerned, it looked like a package that originated in Germany, so they probably thought import + VAT wouldn't apply. I wonder if all Massdrop items are routed through a German distribution centre..?   Delivery overall took 6 days from first dispatch (New Jersey) to delivery (London). Overall pretty good, but I think I got lucky."

frugalmalefashion,3b37p7,Le7els,3,Fri Jun 26 04:47:23 2015 UTC,What do you like about them more than your CPs? How do the compare in fit?
frugalmalefashion,3b37p7,cobaltorange,2,Fri Jun 26 05:09:34 2015 UTC,"They have the same Margom sole so sizing is pretty much the same. I'll try to put this in context of my style and what each shoe does for me. The white CPs are very bright and make somewhat of a statement in themselves. It's hard to wear them without defining the rest of my outfit to work with them. I mean obviously you think about that with every outfit, but the sheer clean whiteness and slender silhouette make them very particularly steered toward slim-skinny denim/chinos or cropped pants (I don't even own any). What I'm trying to say I guess is that they're a tiny bit difficult to wear. Just a tiny. I'm sure the other colors/styles are more versatile, and I'll definitely consider buying another pair when my wardrobe requires some new shoes.  I got my CPs first and they felt like gold in terms of leather when I got them. Not that I'm well versed in leather quality, but compared to any other shoe I've owned, they felt amazing. When I got the Royales, I got the same feeling, maybe even more so. The interior leather is especially nice. (The outer is hard to compare since the Royales are suede). The tongue is a bit thicker and wider with the Royales which threw me off at first. It makes the silhouette slightly different-perhaps a bit more workable. But in terms of my personal style, I've found that the Farro Royale is the perfect sneaker to fit almost every raw denim outfit I can think of. Every outfit I can wear my APC Varenne boots in, I can wear with Royales. I don't feel compelled to revolve my outfit around making it work with my shoes with them. They just...work. The one thing I've done though with my 3 core shoes (APCs, CPs, and Royales) though is socks. I've got a few pairs of Anonymous Ism and Smartwool socks that work great with them. I guess a tl;dr for this would be: the Farro Royale is the perfect sneaker for my style.   I'm not a huge fan of some of the other styles or colors that Greats is offering, but the specific model I chose is an essential to my wardrobe, and I love the company's goals and am excited to see what they do next. Their collabs are cool too. I'm not a shill or anything. I've don't even have any experience with contacting customer support. But I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and this is a great sale that should be taken advantage of."

frugalmalefashion,3b37p7,BpooSoc,3,Fri Jun 26 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"I found their promo pictures to be quite accurate of what they look like in everyday wear, other than that the pants are cropped very high in all the pictures to show off the sneaker/sock dynamic.

The Nimbus (greyish-white) or the Cargo (olive-dark green)  I would like to get the olive green but I'm nervous that it would to be difficult to match dark green shoes. Only thing I can think of is dark blue jeans and a gray t shirt? I do have olive green colored eyes so that works...

The DMO belt is also a better buy than Orion or Corter belts (sorry Eric, i still love my indigo bifold though), both of which are priced evenly with DMO.

Great leather (from back when i loved the brand), but i noticed its only stitched near the buckle. It doesn't have the second stitch an inch or two down like the one featured here. Maybe because the thread is so ""waxy"" it comes apart easily, but i can't say for sure. I'd like to mention another belt i own made by ETWAS, which is handmade and his hammered together with a copper rivet. They have a lifetime guarantee no matter what happens to the belt or what you do it. They're listed for $72, but i got em for around $35 from archival.   http://www.etwasbags.com/other-products/workersbelt/  Edit: I took a closer look at the leather on the Banana belt and was suprised....

The Massdrop description (UK tannery >150 years old) leads me to suspect that DMO uses J&FJ Bakers leather. I have a belt in Bakers and, while the leather quality is amazing, I don't like the smell of it. Evidently, fish oil is used in the tanning process, and the fishy smell is pretty evident while you're wearing it."

Basically in most jackets that come anywhere near fitting me in the shoulders and body, my range of motion in my arms is very limited.  Usually, jackets fail the hug and handshake tests.  Imgur album  I think I'm just a weird build.  I have broad shoulders, so I'm normally a 42R, or just fitting into a medium in most brands.  My arms are large-ish, I guess but certainly not huge (14"" biceps).  My chest is a little over 41"".  Waist 32"", hips 36"".  Going to a 44R usually leads to the shoulder seams spilling too far past my shoulders.  I know I'm going to have to get most things tailored, possibly a lot.  My question is, is there any one thing that's causing this pinch that I can avoid?  It doesn't seem to be caused just by low or high arm holes.  It does seem worse on unstructured jackets.  Do I need to buy jackets with more room in the chest?  Oddly, some slim stuff fits me perfectly (BR modern slim in 42R).  As long as it fits in the shoulders, will it matter if the rest of the thing fits me like a garbage bag for tailoring purposes?  I'd be grateful for any advice.  I really don't want to have to spend $100 in tailoring on every jacket I buy."

I just got the Men's Comfort Jacket in blue.  The fabric is a bit out of the ordinary for a blazer, but makes it ideal for casual wear.  Also, the fit is great (fitted but not overly slim) and it's light enough to wear in the summer."

They are actually darker in person than the pictures, I had light shining directly on them (again, because the picture was taken indoors when there was no sunlight outside).

I know this is frugal male fashion but I have had these for a year know and lime other red wing products get even more comfortable over time and the leather develops character. Easily just as comfortable as my skating shoes at this point. Though they take time to break in."
frugalmalefashion,3azm9x,Big_Bare,2,Thu Jun 25 14:49:18 2015 UTC,I agree. I bought them full price because I'd wanted them for years but didn't have the cash. Once I got a real job out of college I bought these without discount and while it wasn't maximally frugal they are still worth every penny. Extremely high quality.

frugalmalefashion,3ayzne,Sh_beast,17,Wed Jun 24 18:51:20 2015 UTC,The fact that they're the same price seems to be what's wrong but they could just be discounted at different amounts.
frugalmalefashion,3ayzne,tman916x,6,Wed Jun 24 18:59:26 2015 UTC,I agree there is no reason the canvas version should cost as much as leather.

frugalmalefashion,3ayzne,vivameiguo,3,Wed Jun 24 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"Well they're shipping from the UK, hence the high cost.  Don't know why you'd ever expect free overseas shipping on an order under $200."

frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,mursematthew,9,Wed Jun 24 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"Their shirt's quality good. I'd say it's negligibly better or worse than J Crew's. Their main selling point's their designs though.   Their slim fit fits slimmer than J Crew, but not as slim as Banana Republic's tailored slim fit. They tend to have more room in the collar area (if you're looking at shirts that require buttoning of the top button).   From experience, their casual shirts aren't meant to be tucked in. Their length suggests this."

They do cut the popovers and short sleeve shirts shorter and slimmer though."
frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,Wiggerkid,2,Fri Jun 26 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"That's odd. I'm a Medium. For my sizing, it seems that there's a notable difference in sizing. For the sake of reference, Mr. Porter records the measurements of both brands:  Club Monaco Slim Fit Shirt  J Crew Slim Fit Shirt  For my size, there's a notable difference between the brands when it comes to chest size (which seems to actually be the only difference).  For XS though, it seems that Club Monaco's marginally slimmer in the chest, but actually roomier by an inch in the shoulders. So, that might be the reason why the J Crew XS was unbuttonable, while the Club Monaco XS was."
frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,mdzjdz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"j crews last button is the one I can't button.   j crew actual measurements, from j crew  Mr porter does botch measurements fairly often, do you own both shirts? I own plenty of clothes that online measurements are off for.  exact proportions do vary from size to size. So its entirely possible j crew is much smaller for an xs than CM but wider for a medium."
frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,Wiggerkid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:49:56 2015 UTC,"I own a bunch of J Crew and Club Monaco shirts (in Medium Slim).

frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,mdzjdz,2,Fri Jun 26 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"Very good, agree with mdzjdz, it's about on par with J.Crew. I find the ""Slim Fit"" however to be a tad roomier if you are not muscular. I have a small for my frame but even after washing and drying, it's still a tad roomy. I have an X-Small and it's very fitted. My brother is roughly 20lbs lighter, more slender and an X-Small is still roomy on him."

frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,fishdontreddit,3,Wed Jun 24 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"Davis are a slim straight fit. Connor are slimmer & tapered; if you squat, I doubt they'll fit."
frugalmalefashion,3ay92o,dean16,2,Wed Jun 24 19:14:48 2015 UTC,connors fit like 511s

frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,jrlpauig,9,Wed Jun 24 14:09:15 2015 UTC,"For those who don't know:  Gaziano & Girling makes very fine shoes, even offering a bespoke program. Their shoes tend towards a sleeker profile and are rather European in their styling. Their Deco line exaggerates this. The St. James is a classic and beautiful shoe.  Enzo Bonafe are hand welted and very handsome. It is hard to find that much shoe for (I believe) $500. I would buy Enzo over Alden all day every day.  Carmina are a touch cheaper, and Meermin's bug brother. They are a really fine shoe, the finishing is good, and are just a really good value.  Edward Green is the cream of the crop.  St. Crispin's are also amazing.  I'm assuming those last two aren't on sale though."
frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,akaghi,2,Wed Jun 24 14:26:21 2015 UTC,Edward Green wholecuts
frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,holography,4,Wed Jun 24 19:47:43 2015 UTC,That's a very good price for EG. Marginally more expensive than Alden.
frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,akaghi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:53:10 2015 UTC,I think EG vs. StC vs. GG is kind of personal preference on styling.  They're all top notch quality.
frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,bamgrinus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:05:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's pretty much the top tier as a whole.  I personally don't like G&G's styling. It's a bit much for me usually. But they make a damn fine pair of shoes."
frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,akaghi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot, but I say that as someone who will probably never buy a pair. If I were actually in the market for a shoe in that price range, I don't know what I'd do. I'd probably get some Galways first. Can't go wrong there."
frugalmalefashion,3ayby7,bamgrinus,3,Thu Jun 25 00:51:34 2015 UTC,"Galways are perfect.  I don't know what I'd get, but it sure as hell wouldn't be G&G.  I'd love something from Berlutti so I could pretend Anthony Dwlos touched it.  It would be Schroedinger's shoe. You can't tell me whether or not he made my shoe, so he both did and did not. But did."

Luckily I found a couple in XS which were a little too snug, but as long as I don't toss them in the dryer they fit well. For reference I usually wear an XS in J.Crew's oxfords. If no one buys these I might just pay to get them tailored.    Harrington Jacket - Abercrombie (MSRP: $140) - NWT  Size: Medium  Color: Navy  Price: $100 + Shipping  Pictures: 1,  2,  3, Tagged  Fits slim, true to size. I was looking for an alternative for the Tom Ford harrington or the Baracuta G9, and found this jacket. I bought both a small and a medium, and I prefer the fit of the small. The jacket has a tartan lining, and a small Abercrombie logo on the left arm (I removed the patch on my jacket with a seam ripper, and can do the same for you if you'd like).    NOTE: If you would like any measurements, additional pictures, or fit pics please feel free to ask."

frugalmalefashion,3awzsa,Paralleled,2,Wed Jun 24 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"For me, the quality has always been top-notch. For as long as I've worn them (years), they've never really ripped or worn out, even in high stress areas on the body. The fit is more of a personal preference (1040, 770, 484), and they are as advertised. For example the 1040 is a true slim straight fit; the 770 is a bit slimmer; and the 484 is the slimmest. You might want to size down if you're between sizes because the fabric does tend to stretch. Overall though I'd recommend, especially at these prices."

frugalmalefashion,3av15m,shug24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:55:11 2015 UTC,I'm hoping my nearby Central Florida Dillard's has some good deals!

frugalmalefashion,3awo5r,noblecustom,17,Wed Jun 24 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"So I downloaded the app and was able to navigate the custom shoes after a 5 to 7 minute installation and loading period.  First impression is that it needs work, at least for the Android version. The font is microscopic, especially for the ""shoe mirror"". Honestly, I got frustrated and uninstalled it pretty quickly. I wanted to give it a shot, especially since I invested time into getting everything set up, but man, it was frustrating. I don't think people who want to shop for stuff wants to install an app and enter a code just to see a pair of shoes. You're kind of turning off your customer base.  The website layout is okay, but that custom shoe function needs A LOT of work.  Thanks for posting though."

frugalmalefashion,3awo5r,todayismyluckyday,2,Wed Jun 24 14:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured as much. On the Google play store, the app only has 100 downloads.

frugalmalefashion,3avtks,akaghi,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"I saw someone mention a comparison to Orion and then it got deleted - Funny you should mention cuz I also have an Orion belt.  I would say the finishing is slightly finer, and seems to include more handwork (though Orion doesn't seem to publish exactly what is hand done on their site).  The DMO belt uses wax polyester stitching to secure the buckle (reportedly better than snaps) and is slightly thinner than my show harness Orion.  At about the same price I would say the DMO is slightly better.  At MSRP would be a toss up to me.  Both good, wouldn't be wrong to go either, though I haven't had the DMO belt long enough to attest to its durability firsthand."

frugalmalefashion,3avtks,9to5reddit,2,Wed Jun 24 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"""Don't Mourn, Organize! belts are measured from the center hole to the end of the buckle. Measure your own belt using the most used hole to the end of the buckle to determine your size. Do not order your usual pants size, as the belt will be too small. Most people order a belt 2-4"" larger than their pants size.""    I wear 36 in Dockers D2, 38 in some other brands but I measured my old belt and it was 41-42 inches to the most used hole and I went up 2 sizes from my actual belt measurement instead of pant size and ordered a 44.  I just misunderstood I guess because it is way too long.  I probably should have ordered a size 38 or 40.  I guess I know how I screwed up now."
frugalmalefashion,3avtks,96nevaR,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:23:22 2015 UTC,I am usually a 34 pants (vanity sizing?) but sometimes a 36. I ordered a 36 belt and it barely buckles. Do you think I should get a 38 or 40?

There are a lot of changes I really don't care about, but I got a pair of van authentics for $20 on Sunday doing this.

frugalmalefashion,3aty6a,livewire911,9,Tue Jun 23 15:22:56 2015 UTC,By that reasoning you should buy all of your shorts at walmart.  If its cheap why bother caring about the quality right?

frugalmalefashion,3au847,LifeUp,5,Tue Jun 23 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"well if your chest actually measures 37 inches, giving yourself .5"" of extra room is going to be a crazy skin tight fit pulling at the buttons.  Give yourself at least 2-3 inches to have moving room, go for the 15"

Warning:  I saw a bunch of Thompson suit jackets and Thompson shirts, which I'm pretty sure is J. Crew Factory.  I didn't know they would include JCF items here too.  Make sure you know what you're getting.  In my experience, JCF shirts don't say ""Factory"" on them."

frugalmalefashion,3atyxg,sanctusx2,3,Tue Jun 23 15:00:42 2015 UTC,They look inflated to me too.  Their 50% off prices are in the range of what Amazon charges normally.  Reminds me of the trashy Levi's sales.  Retail and online stores sell everything for the same or cheaper than the discounted prices from their own website because it's % off MSRP.

frugalmalefashion,3aqzr7,GarandThumb,3,Mon Jun 22 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. The V is very deep and the length is very long. They're perfect undershirts. Wouldn't work at all alone. In addition to those reasons above, the material is very light giving it a sheen. It would look and hang awful on any body as anything but an undershirt. I wear them under my ocbds to keep from having to wash them frequently.  The supima are what you want for a stand alone. They're really comfy with a shallow v and the material hangs great. On the other hand they're a bit thick to be worn as an undershirt. I wear these alone all the time for a casual look.  The packaged dry ex are somewhere in between. The lightness and v shape makes them not as good looking as the supima, but they look ok stand alone.  I was hoping for a best of both worlds but really it's like a master of none. These I use when I don't care about my look and it's too warm to wear the supima. Might make for a good undershirt if you get cold, though not as good as a thermal or anything.  Different shirts for different purposes."

If you want to measure a shirt made from stretchy fabric (as opposed to something that ""moves with you""), just use a frame such as this one.

frugalmalefashion,3apo3h,SlimSmokey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:21:27 2015 UTC,did u get any? I was going to get the aerial desert boot and the torbay craft white leather. how is the sizing?
frugalmalefashion,3apo3h,jsquareddddd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"I got both of the shoes I linked above, the Farlis in a 9.5 and the other in 10.5. I wear a 10.5 in Clark's boots so I thought it would be about the same, unfortunately both were on the small side and I will have to return them for a half size larger. I have wide ass balogna sandwich feet though and that's the main issue, if they had a wider option in these sizes they would be perfect.  I may get something else after the return goes through but probably not, unless they offer a wider size in something."
frugalmalefashion,3apo3h,SlimSmokey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:57:57 2015 UTC,oh sorry they didnt work out.. What size do you usually wear in like vans or polos? is the return free or how much? also so do you recommend that i get the deser aerials in 10 and the torbay craft in 10.5 since i wear 10.5 us size?
frugalmalefashion,3apo3h,jsquareddddd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"I normally wear a 10.5 or 11 in most everything so I was hoping these would work out. The Torbays were snug but would have probably worked ok after some break in, the Farlis though were just too natrow for me. They apparently do free returns so far as I can tell, just have to print out a return label and send them off."
frugalmalefashion,3apo3h,SlimSmokey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:42:29 2015 UTC,So stay with the 10.5 torbay's right and I'm thinking 10 for the desert aerials then! Thanks man!

frugalmalefashion,3aqjxk,Norville_Barnes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:25:59 2015 UTC,Potentially stupid question here... Why do my aidens and Levis 514s both in 34 length land at very different spots on the same shoes? It's baffled me for awhile now. My aidens are significantly shorter than the Levis
frugalmalefashion,3aqjxk,kishan512,2,Mon Jun 22 18:39:44 2015 UTC,Wild guess but maybe it's because of the type of fabric and the amount it shrunk after washing/drying.
frugalmalefashion,3aqjxk,holybejeebus,2,Mon Jun 22 18:49:19 2015 UTC,Can confirm that my Aidens shrunk a lot. I buy a length up.

frugalmalefashion,3aqjxk,Citizen_V,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:59:39 2015 UTC,You can just avoid drying them in the dryer and wash with cold water.

frugalmalefashion,3apxn6,essmac,4,Mon Jun 22 15:34:57 2015 UTC,I heard Navali had zipper issues a while back but the rivets are something new. Seems like they can't get the metal hardware right.  I was thinking about getting a Navali computer bag when they had the zipper issues since their customer service was quick to respond and acknowledge the problem. But I ultimately got a Filson and haven't looked back since.

frugalmalefashion,3apxn6,dkismet,2,Tue Jun 23 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"I've used a Navali messenger bag quite a bit and had no issues, for what it's worth.  Sucks that you're having issues with yours, but I do think the majority of people that have tried Navali have had generally positive experiences with the product; seems like your items are outliers.  Navali has pretty good CS though, they should correct their mistake."
frugalmalefashion,3apxn6,liurobs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:14:29 2015 UTC,Their CS has been very good. I just mailed back the messenger bag for repair/replacement today.

Sorry you're having troubles."
frugalmalefashion,3apxn6,dano8801,2,Wed Jun 24 00:11:53 2015 UTC,"I wanted a leather messenger bag really, really badly.  Fell in love with one made by Osgoode Marley, but it cost like $265.  I just couldn't justify spending that much.  I checked out TJ Maxx just for the hell of it.    I found a brown leather Kenneth Cole Reaction messenger bag for around $80 I think?  I looked it up online and it was selling for about double that.  If you had asked me in the past, I don't think I would have wished to purchase Kenneth Cole Reaction; especially not pricier leather goods.  But my FIL bought me a leather jacket a couple years ago that is still beautiful, and this messenger bag has been nothing but great from day one."
frugalmalefashion,3apxn6,Blitzwire,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:12:26 2015 UTC,"I've come close to purchasing a Kenneth Cole messenger but went with Navali this time around.  My old bag was a David King distressed leather messenger, which has a softer, unfinished rawhide kind of look. It was a decent bag but the tan leather gets dirty pretty easily. Mine picked up a blueish black tint from rubbing on denim jeans. A leather repair shop said there was not much they could do to clean it."
frugalmalefashion,3apxn6,Trasmus,2,Wed Jun 24 21:02:55 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar issue to you, actually got my bag this past winter as well so it might just be a bad batch. I'll agree with your edit: Navali is very good about repairing their products free of charge. The problem for me ultimately was I couldn't keep sending the bags back. After two duds I went with a Filson that was on sale for $160, which was double the price what I paid for the Navali bag but it's been great ever since.  For what it's worth, I still think Navali is a great company. I just imagine they would spend less on customer service and repairs if they just get the manufacturing right the first time."

frugalmalefashion,3apoyj,ColdsnapBryan,2,Mon Jun 22 14:22:18 2015 UTC,Since this is a relatively new fit.. How's the sizing on these?  I usually wear a 33x30 in 511 (34x30 only in Rigid Dragon) and I have used a 33x30 in non-rigid 501 STF (max shrinkage using super hot water and a dryer run in very high heat). Should I get a 32x30 in these? My waist is also getting a little smaller
frugalmalefashion,3apoyj,ajenius620,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"I went to try these on at the store over the weekend. The waist was about 2 sizes too big, and then the legs seemed to be the right size (for the marked size).   I wasn't able to try on my normal size because they didn't have it in stock, but I would assume the waist would be way too big. The ones I tried on fit me like skinny jeans, while the waist was the right size. Meanwhile a regular 501 with a taper from the knee down would probably fit me perfect.   On the other hand I also tried on the 541 and those fit perfectly.   Edit: I should note I'm a hockey player with big thighs. So if you need some extra room, but not that much, size down 2."

frugalmalefashion,3apoyj,ngeds,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:46:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, OP! Sounds like a fit I've been looking for, as the 511s are a little tight on my thigh. I'll post when I get fits!"
frugalmalefashion,3apoyj,Vanislh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:03:04 2015 UTC,Definitely the cheapest price I've seen 501CT for. If you want to try out the cut.
frugalmalefashion,3apoyj,DoctorBigtime,0,Tue Jun 23 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"Be careful, high rise is high."

frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,mcthiel,2,Sun Jun 21 20:19:55 2015 UTC,I'm about 95% sure Marks discontinued carrying Clarks boots a while ago. When did you get yours? It was probably on a clearance sale because they were trying to get rid of all the inventory. Bushacres rarely drop below $90 CAD in any store unless there's a really specific deal.
frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,moldycondom,5,Sun Jun 21 19:20:31 2015 UTC,I was able to get mine for around $35 ($70ish for two pairs) when they had the Marks buy 1 get 1 free sale!
frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,LittleSpareChang,3,Sun Jun 21 19:45:32 2015 UTC,Purchased mine online in Jan 2015. I think they did a BOGO 50% or something like that couple months after too

frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,kingsin4,3,Sun Jun 21 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"I guess you are right, the bushacres appear to be lined and the desert boots are completely unlined. Also, the eyelets are different colors and the leathers are a slightly different shade (in Beeswax at least)"

frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,JakeChip,12,Mon Jun 22 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"My experience with these (the slightly different original desert boots): I wore them to work (desk job) for about a year and the front stitching just gave out so now the leather separates from the sole every step.  Pretty light use for this to have already happened in my opinion.  I found them comfortable enough after the initial week break in unlike other commenters.  For what it's worth, I don't plan on repairing or repurchasing.  Better boots for your money are widely available as I've learned.  Also, in case you're like me and the ""desert boot"" nomenclature went over your head. These shoes are terrible in any sort of wet weather.  It's as if they actively pull water into the shoe."

frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,elchismoso,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:43:45 2015 UTC,"How are they uncomfortable? What words can you use to describe the discomfort?  You could perhaps try half a size up/down and see if they feel any better. Otherwise, you could try different insoles if possible and see how that works out. I experience a lot of discomfort with shoes that look nice but are either too narrow or have arch support that doesn't quite fit with my foot arches."
frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,JDnTexas,2,Sun Jun 21 21:59:42 2015 UTC,They seem very hard with not much padding. I have a high arch and they do feel flat. I think you're right with trying a different insole.
frugalmalefashion,3amlpx,SelvedgeLeopard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"You aren't alone. I tried on the Beeswax CDB at a Nordstroms, and that thing was STIFF. I am sure it would ahve broken in nicely over time, but it is rather uncomfortable at first.   Besides that, the shoe doesn't have much support, so if you have pronation issues, this is probably not the shoe for you. The crepe soles look pretty inconsistently made from shoe-to-shoe, so one may cause you to overpronate and one underpronate.   Other than that, they look amazing and develop a nice broken-in patina/wear over time. I would get them as a nice casual shoe you can wear to lounges."

frugalmalefashion,3aonux,Chi149,4,Mon Jun 22 06:22:49 2015 UTC,How does this site differ from grailed?
frugalmalefashion,3aonux,lurkingonmfa,11,Mon Jun 22 09:01:50 2015 UTC,"Most obvious difference is the slew of garbage brands sold on here.  Not that the brands are that bad, but American Eagle is so cheap, I really don't need to buy a used AE t-shirt that I can probably get new for cheaper with one of their many sales. Or used Gap Outlet clothing for that matter."
frugalmalefashion,3aonux,nsummy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:42:53 2015 UTC,It's more akin to grailed basic. I saw a Brooks Brothers wool great coat (not sure of terminology) for $108 with 40-50% off so around $60 shipped so you can find some good in the not so good.  Edit: the descriptions are nonexistent and sizing is off if you look at the actual measurements but at least they provide measurements.
frugalmalefashion,3aonux,nsummy,2,Mon Jun 22 18:31:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm not even sure if I can trust their measurements.  This becomes very apparent when it comes to Levis, which prints their size on the label.  They have a pair of 34x32 511s on there that they say has a 35 inch inseam and an 11 inch rise.  I'll still buy a few things but I'm not putting much faith into them.  And to be honest I'm not sure most of this stuff is a deal without the 40% off code.    I guess one benefit is if you are willing to spend the time searching, you might find stuff others might pass."
frugalmalefashion,3aonux,jackellekcaj,5,Mon Jun 22 19:48:14 2015 UTC,Seems to be set pricing through a company and not haggling so a tad different. Still second hand though

frugalmalefashion,3aleep,michaelhe,11,Sun Jun 21 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I agree that these are not proper hiking boots, that is clear as day! What I disagree with is the idea that true hiking boots no longer have a place in the industry.  I would have to politely disagree, as a trail runner will not provide ankle stability when hiking with a heavy load ( hiking/mountaineering industry standard is to recommend boots when carrying over 50 lbs of pack) or on very technical -read""ankle breaking""- terrain.  Hiking boots are also easier to use with waterproof gaiters,to extend your waterproofing to just below the knees!  With that being said, not everyone carries that much weight or goes off-trail, and the trail running market has exploded with brands trying to cash in on the casual everyday hiker, who just needs a Wee bit more than his Nikes can handle:)"
frugalmalefashion,3aleep,pipe_creek_man,8,Sun Jun 21 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"from reading /r/appalachiantrail, the trend definitely seems to be going towards abandoning boots due to their weight and waterproofness (because waterproof means no breathability for your feet). You can get high-top trail runners with ankle support (like the old Saucony Progrid Outlaws) if you're worried about twisting an ankle, but from what I understand, even regular trail runners are nice for the mobility over tricky terrain"
frugalmalefashion,3aleep,michaelhe,6,Sun Jun 21 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, the AT is a beast all its own! That is definitely true, i guess it all comes down to where one is adventuring! On the mostly dry, sometimes humid,always hot AT, waterproof is forsure a killer. I concede that you're  spot on about high top trail runners, for instance the La Sportiva GTX surround mid is sold out almost everywhere right now. Although its waterproof with GTX, they use a new architecture for the waterproof sleeve inside the shoe,making it more breathable by draining  heat and moisture through the midsole!  Im more of an alpinist,however, so I'm biased towards my high tops and my waterproofs ! Different strokes, for different folks i guess.  Thanks for the stimulating discussion /u/michaelhe :)"
frugalmalefashion,3aleep,pipe_creek_man,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't know about that. Not to say that these are any good, but boots still have their uses -- I'd probably choose them on very rocky and muddy terrain, in ice and snow, carrying 50+ lbs, and for thorny bushbashing. I've hiked in heavy winter boots, slippers, flip-flops, minimalist shoes, trailrunners, lightweight boots, trail shoes, etc. For an all-around shoe I'd probably prefer and recommend the last one above the others."

For suits, Tailored Slim is the biggest (over both Monogram and Modern Slim).   Trust me, I'd fire the guy or gal who names the sizes if I could, haha. It's caused untold problems."

Just had one for memorial day, and they don't (usually) happen more than quarterly. Who knows about 4th of July though.   If you want to get the Travelers at less than $68, you're better off just waiting until they go on sale (like the black and light rinse ones did a few months back) so they're part of the 20-40% off sale events.   Also, depending on how the deal is coded, a 40% off exclusion and 25% off e-mail signup might not stack. Usually they have a caveat that says ""Does not combine with other offers.""

Actually on second thought, it's not a diameter, it's just half of a circumference (they take this measurement by laying it flat and measuring across). Not sure if there's a term for it. The 8"" measurement is just half of the circumference, which is bigger than the diameter."

frugalmalefashion,3afkow,trilll,3,Fri Jun 19 19:14:13 2015 UTC,YMMV the king of prussia jcrew had a bunch. This pair is def once washed
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,riem630,2,Fri Jun 19 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Not that it makes a difference, but where is it made?"
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,BTrigg,2,Fri Jun 19 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"Being a J Crew employee, I know for a fact that you cannot use your student discount with sale items that are discounted 50%. With 40% you can use the student discount, but not with 50%  And if they gave you the student discount on top of the 50%, they're not supposed to.  I suggest saying you have the student discount when buying any j crew item 50% off and if they give it to you, congrats, but don't be surprised if they say you can't."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,Citizen_V,2,Fri Jun 19 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Why the limitation on 50%? Technically, shouldn't they not allow you to combine it with any promotion?   Offer cannot be redeemed for cash or combined with any other promotion.   Luckily, my store allows me to combine it, even with 50% off (final) sale items."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,BTrigg,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:46:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure. Maybe we just can't allow customers to go over 60% off but when sale is marked 40%, you can add the student discount for 55% off, which is reasonable?  And that's cool. Try not to spread the word too far that they do that cause they're not supposed to and you could potentially not get it if the store does it too often lol"
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,shrimp_wongton,4,Sat Jun 20 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but your math is terribly wrong. 50% with an extra 15% is 57.5% off, while 40% with an extra 15% is 49% off.  From my experiences though, they always seem to apply student discount on top of the 50%, and I've tried it at 3 different stores, and online when I called from the store."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,BTrigg,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:51:23 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, you're right. My bad. That makes more sense tho because it wouldn't allow customers more than 50% total.   And honestly, it's sounding like most J. Crew stores don't follow all policies. It depends on the manager and how they handle their stores. Corporate rarely checks up on us unless we're doing really bad."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,ObsidianOrder,2,Sat Jun 20 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"From recent reports, it would seem that corporate wouldn't complain at all as long as you are moving merchandise.  I hope if there's major turnover at j crew, the women's division doesn't take the men's division down with it."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,BTrigg,2,Sun Jun 21 03:03:41 2015 UTC,I agree

Many are distressed.  They are def nice jeans, just know that you're buying fades, not making them."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,prisonstrength,7,Fri Jun 19 19:19:49 2015 UTC,Being not raw and being distressed are not the same thing. They could be washed and still be dark indigo. And jeans that are washed can still fade just fine.
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,here_to_fuck_up,2,Fri Jun 19 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"I was trying to communicate that many have been distressed (lines in the crotch, knees and thighs) even if the picture looks like they aren't. My understanding of the word ""Raw"" generally refers to jeans being untreated or not have special washes applied.   Some of the jcrew selvedge look not-distressed from the pictures on their website, but in person have distressing.  I think I used raw correctly here. I have no idea how a pair of jeans with distressing could be called raw, but I'm open to learning."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,legaceez,5,Fri Jun 19 20:03:22 2015 UTC,I think he was more saying just because it's washed doesn't mean it's distressed.  But yes I agree I don't think any of their offerings are raw. I bought one that was most def distressed with lines and holes/scrapes that was very hard to tell on the online image.
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,here_to_fuck_up,-3,Fri Jun 19 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"Why is my post getting down voted then? I don't think what I said was factually wrong, and I sure as hell would what to know it if I was buying their jeans."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,legaceez,4,Fri Jun 19 20:11:39 2015 UTC,No idea why but it wasn't me.  Some people are just generous with dislikes lol...
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,von_sip,2,Fri Jun 19 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"not raw and being distressed are not the same thing   Yes they are. Raw Denim is any denim that is untreated or unwashed and is therefore left in an unadulterated form. The opposite of this is pre-washed, pre-distressed, or treated denim.  http://www.dyerandjenkins.com/blogs/journal/12877033-raw-and-selvedge-denim-dont-be-misinformed"
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,prisonstrength,2,Fri Jun 19 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"No, they're not. Just because a pair has been washed does not mean that pre-distressing has been done. You say this in your own post.    pre-washed, pre-distressed, or treated denim.    It can be one of those three. It does not have to be all three."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,von_sip,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:21:04 2015 UTC,My point is that if you're buying pre-distressed or pre-washed denim it's not raw denim.
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,prisonstrength,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"Which does not at all disagree with what I said.   In your first response to me, you quoted me saying this:    not raw and being distressed are not the same thing   and said this:    Yes they are.    and I'm saying, no they're not. It's like a square and a rectangle. All jeans that are pre-distressed are not raw, but all non-raw jeans are not pre-distressed."

That's all that happened.   None of this is a big deal. I don't know why this is such a big deal to you."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,here_to_fuck_up,-5,Fri Jun 19 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"Because if people are considering spending money on jeans, I'd like them to know what they are buying. Most of the online jcrew stuff is final sale.   This is FMF, not rawdenim or MFA."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,prisonstrength,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"There are more than 600 items in J. Crew's men's sale section and less than 40 of them are final sale. Even then, J.

I know what sub this is, and I felt that my comment was appropriate for it. I'm sorry. Don't really know what else to say."

frugalmalefashion,3afkow,prisonstrength,2,Fri Jun 19 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you? I just wanted to clarify that just because they weren't raw doesn't mean they are distressed, and also say that jeans that aren't raw can still fade just fine."
frugalmalefashion,3afkow,here_to_fuck_up,-3,Fri Jun 19 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"You didn't clarify anything, instead you muddied my post.   J.Crew selvedge is mostly distressed. Even if the pants don't look like it on the website. You trying to make your point implied that I got mine wrong.   I was ready to pull the trigger on one of those pants but on an off whim decided to look for reviews and learned that the Wallace line was distressed.

The link /u/von_sip posted certainly doesn't refer to the jeans in question. The point is that his statement that the opposite of raw denim is pre-distressed is generally false.

frugalmalefashion,3af0ru,emann2,3,Fri Jun 19 16:24:20 2015 UTC,I would never buy another pair of sunglasses from this company.   My own personal experience with this company has been terrible. They never responded to any of my emails regarding the Cyber Monday deal. They also completely ignored all my email asking for a refund.  I just gave up because it is not worth my time dealing with such bad customer service.

frugalmalefashion,3ac0uj,lIlIlIlIlIlII,0,Fri Jun 19 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Its not just a matter of being well know, Vibergs tend to sell out within days of being list and are rarely discounted. So people were willing to wait 2+ hours in line for the opportunity to buy something. I'm sure that's not the case with J.crew, which are way more ubiquitous, easy to access, and are discounted to a reasonable price very frequently.

This is far less similar to a Luminor Panerai than, say, a Steinhart diver is to a Rolex Submariner."

I snagged - Khaki linen scout shorts - $35, olive nylon scout shorts - $35, indigo dyed short sleeve button up - $45 and three t-shirts for $35 total  They had pretty much everything they had when they did the sample sale back in March so I opted to get summer gear since its been quite hot in LA the last few weeks and it will probably get worse.  Chore coats were $80, most button ups were $50, outwear ranged from $50 to$100, belts were $25"

Would that be the best way to do this? I'm not really two sharp on these sorts of things.  I would be able to follow a few items myself but I don't think I could do a whole lot more than that on my own so if anyone has any ideas or a good idea of how to go about it please comment!

Compared to BR Aidens, I believe the thighs may be a tad slimmer but below the knee is wider. I personally love the fit of the few I just received but if you're skinny, it may not be as slim as you want below the knee.

frugalmalefashion,3a7gum,fleetandpassive,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:17:39 2015 UTC,"I got one from the Unionmade sale, and really like it.  I like it about as much as a Momotaro chambray that I bought at full price, and they're my 2 favorite shirts.    It's made in China which turns me off quite a bit, but the construction is excellent and the material is heavy and comfy.  I would definitely pay $100 for another.  I think that's a fair price."

frugalmalefashion,3a7gum,pojosamaneo,2,Thu Jun 18 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"I get frugality, but what makes their shirts worth retail in the first place? Honest question for someone that owns products from here."
frugalmalefashion,3a7gum,yourfriendkyle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"Essentially there are a few things when considering the ""worth"" of clothing: Construction, Material, Design, and Brand.   Is the stitching well done? Are the clothes made in a country that treats it's textile workers decently?   Is the cotton of high quality? Is that jacket actually wool or is it a composite of some synthetics? Is the wool sourced from a place that treats it's agricultural works decently?   Does it look nice? Are the cuts fitting to a modern taste?   And then you have some things that can get away with charging more just for having a popular Brand that is considered ""quality"" (Steve Madden & Levis, I'm looking directly at you two)  It's really up to you to decide where on the scale of affordability you reside.  Some people are willing to spend $100 on a shirt that is discounted because they feel it is worth it."
frugalmalefashion,3a7gum,jrlpauig,2,Thu Jun 18 14:15:21 2015 UTC,Please read the About Frugality section on the sidebar. Pointing out whether something is or is not frugal is not helpful.

frugalmalefashion,3a69ro,tricky_p,9,Wed Jun 17 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"Customs is always after. Whether you get taxed depends on the cost, the item, shipping method and your luck.

If it goes through local posts, there's a good chance you'll never see a bill."

frugalmalefashion,3a8dox,yourfriendkyle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:18:45 2015 UTC,"Sharp quality casual shirts if you can get them for no more than $40 -- I usually snag them when I see them at the $25-30 range. I am typically a small, I go Medium on their slim fits and small on their ""Mod"" or regular fits. The sleeves always end up being ungodly long (for someone who needs 32 sleeve).  Shoes are alright, the higher-priced ones denote better quality in their case. They have a lot of chukkas but they're the type of shoe from Sherman that are ""always"" discounted. I would put them at the same level as Penguin's casual shoe.  Browse the clearance racks at Lord & Taylor or Nordstrom Rack at end of season sales and you'll have better deals than their site (looking at these markdowns -- as usual, they suck). Furthermore, try 6PM for deals too."

Crew 29/30 Bowery Slim Pants $30 shipped   To small for me in the waist. Originally 29/32, had them hemmed to 29/30. Great color, especially for fall pants. Worn probably 15 times. The Bowery Slim fit isn't as aggressive as the 484 fit, but most people like it better than the Urban Slim fit.  Dark Gray Dockers 30/30 Alpha Slim Pants $15 shipped   I think they were labeled as ""Hurricane"" for the color, but I'm not sure. Worn a decent amount, I liked these pants. A little too slim for my taste though, so I've decided to sell them. One defect is a missing closure button -- I'm not sure how exactly to describe it. It's not the one at the top of the fly, it's the one off to the side that holds down the extra flap of material. Doesn't affect the pants at all that it's missing, the extra material just remains at your waist.  Orange Dockers 30/32 Alpha Slim Pants $12 shipped   I just don't wear these enough. I ordered ""Brick Red"" and got these orange ones instead, didn't realize they were the wrong ones until it was too late to return them. Worn about five times. Fun pants.    Jackets   Navy J. Crew XS Quilted Shirt Jacket $50 shipped   I like this jacket a lot, but it doesn't fit me quite the way I wanted it to. Didn't wear it much, maybe five times or so. It's a good fall/spring jacket. Not super warm, but thick enough to keep away some cold. Retailed for $168.  Blue/Gray J. Crew XS Ludlow Sportcoat in Mini-Houndstooth Cotton $60 shipped  - Really good sportcoat for summer since it's 97% cotton. I like it a lot, but just don't wear it enough. Worn about ten times. Retailed for $188. SOLD   Button Downs   Rose Tile Plaid J. Crew Slim XS Buttondown $25 shipped   Material is called Indian cotton, which is lighter than an OCBD. Good shirt for summer. Worn a few times, but it's too small for me. Retailed for $75.  Light Blue Uniqlo Slim S OCBD $18 shipped each   Pretty much everyone knows this shirt. Good quality, slim fit. I have the same shirt in white that I'm selling for the same price, just let me know.    Sweatpants   Light Grey J. Crew XS Sweatpants $25 shipped   Great sweatpants, just too small for me. Worn a decent amount, but still in great shape. There's a loose thread on the pocket, but it doesn't affect anything.     Shoes   Clark's Desert Boots in Grey Suede size 7.5 $35 shipped   Too small for me. Good shoes, not too much wear on them.   Grey New Balance 574 size 9 $60 shipped   Awesome shoes, barely any wear. Just a tiny bit too small for me. Love these things though.  Black Allen Edmonds Park Avenues size 9.5 $125 shipped   High-quality shoes, they're just half a size too big for me. Wish I could keep these.   Chippewa Apaches size 8 $70 shipped   I really like these boots, but they're a little small on me. Worn about 15 times, so tons of life left.     Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer when I can. Again, all offers will be considered, and I will entertain trade offers as well. Thanks for looking!"

The jacket is in top condition and, as in the movie, will help you to win the admiration of Turkish people. PLEASE DO NOT WEAR THIS AROUND JUDY DENCH!!!   42/L J. Crew Brown Tweed Mayfair Topcoat $300 This coat is the model that was the trademark long winter coat of the short-lived Canadian and Panamanian television detective serial ""Buddy Tremblay"", a forgetful detective with a penchant for solving crimes while eating crabs in his jacuzzi (which he called his ""j'accus-i""). The coat was heavily featured in the episode ""The Syrup Broker"" in which Buddy manages to break up a ring of international syrup smugglers with the help of a new and mysterious love interest. The series only lasted two episodes after that. I'm pretty sure she left some stuff in the coat. After all, I do not use Burt's Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm. Or I should say, I didn't before owning this coat. As such, the lip balm is not included. Please do not ask for it.    Bottoms     Size Brand/Item Price Description    31 NWT Apolis Utility Chino, Green $90 Wow, these are some great pants! What can I say about them? Well they've never been worn, tried on once! I bought a pair in 32 and 31 and the 32 fit better so now I'm passing on the savings to you!!!!! The fabric's very light and has a canvas-like weave. They breathe well, look great. Suggested usage: put them on your legs, secure fastenings, avoid indecent exposure arrests.   31 NWOT LVC Selvage 501 $90 Never worn, tried on once. These are some classic heavy hitters. Denim is thick, but soft, kind of like that linebacker you tutored in algebra in high school who had a heart of gold.   33 J. Crew Slate 484 Corduroy $35 Handsome pair of lightly used cords. Condition 9.5/10, barely worn. If you put these on your legs, they can protect you from the elements, keep you warm and earn you the occasional compliment from the observant passer-by. YOU WILL NOT GET POWERS FROM WEARING THESE! PLEASE STOP ASKING ME!!   33 J. Crew Acorn 484 Corduroy $35 See above desc.    Footwear    Size Brand/Item Price Description    11 Wolverine Color 8 1k Mile Boots $200 These size 11 Claude-hoppers are in great condition. I've only worn them a few times and as such there's some minor wear on the soles. Nothing a night in the strip-club wouldn't do to anyone's soul. These unfortunately are just a bit too large for me. They're stored with a pair of shoe trees which I will include with them if you're willing to press the buy it now button. When I bought these I could've sworn they fit. My feet have been shrinking for years now, though, the result of a curse my grandmother put on me when I left the old country. Because I as-of-yet have been unable to find a cure, I'm passing the bounty of this blight on to you. Act fast, and if you're feeling unsure, remember that it's me that's cursed, and not the boots."

frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,unarmed_black_man,0,Wed Jun 17 09:02:23 2015 UTC,In the first video I couldn't hear the ticking. Maybe I would if the reviewer didn't have a fan that is super loud going.
frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,grimreeper,3,Wed Jun 17 09:14:03 2015 UTC,I disagree. I keep it in the bottom of my sock drawer. In a sock. And I can still hear it. Sometimes I just pull out the winder to stop the movement altogether to get it to stfu
frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,jamesgott,6,Wed Jun 17 08:03:53 2015 UTC,I kind of like the ticking of it. It is soothing...but I could see how it also may sound like the telltale heart

frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,l_Am_Providence,-2,Wed Jun 17 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a $15 watch. It sells typically for around 30, though I've seen it marked from as low as $22 to $50 at Macy's ( plus the cost of a new band). More importantly though, it's on par with a $8 analog Casio in terms of quality. It's essentially a knock off seiko. I bought my seiko on sale for $35, though strangely enough they're now $50 on Amazon. I think that's the highest price I've ever seen for them.  To be fair, I'm not a fan of the seiko 5 either, as they get progressively more and more inaccurate over time. Automatic watches are silly antiquated technology IMO.  To each his own, but that ticking is obnoxious."
frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,JosephSmithsGhost,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"It is a $15 watch.  Worth is established by one's willingness to pay said amount for a product.  If a Weekender sells for $15, it's a $15 watch.  If a Planet Ocean sells for $15, that's a $15 watch.  If you want to argue semantics, my last weekender I got was off woot for $12 so it's an even lower price point.  ""Automatic watches are silly antiquated technology IMO.""  Steer clear of /r/watches if you think that automatics are silly and antiquated.  I personally enjoy the ticking but that's besides the point.  If you're expecting to pay bottom of the barrel prices for a product, it isn't going to be a luxury product."

frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,bamgrinus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:44:41 2015 UTC,Not all people. It's a great watch for its price. Should a lot be spent on a watch just for the sake of spending a lot?
frugalmalefashion,3a4kmi,cobaltorange,0,Wed Jun 17 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. I just think it's an important detail. When you start dressing a bit more formally, a watch becomes a point of differentiation as dress codes allow fewer ways to distinguish one's self. It's a traditional way to show a bit of personality. Wearing the same shitty watch that everybody else on the Internet wears... Well, I just don't see the appeal. It's like when you see somebody with a totally on point outfit, but they just paid no attention to their shoes."

I have the indigo ones and have worn them really often. They're especially great for travel. The Banana Republic traveler pant is more than $100 and rarely goes on sale, but I like the feel of the Uniqlos better because they're slightly thinner. I just wish they'd have some inseams shorter than 34 inches, as a short guy I don't like rolling up the cuffs."

I returned them all and got j crew mainline broken-in chinos instead. They're more expensive, but the material is way nicer and the fit is consistent.  Ill update my post in a minute with some pics.   Edit: Pictures still uploading... When they're up, you'll note the ""official"" pair reads 28x32; I'm not sure if that's a mismatched label or not, but the sizing matches a mainline brand 29x32 in every measurement.

I went in expecting to be blown away by the quality and there was no difference really between them and J.Crew..so I just went to J.Crew because you can actually buy things in their store
frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,graps,17,Tue Jun 16 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"It used to be so much better a few years ago. Made in America, unlimited returns for any reason at any length of time. Just a legit company that cared about customers.   I still own and regularly wear a pair of their original chinos (which put the company on the map) and a fall river chambray shirt that I bought in 2012. Both MIUSA and incredible quality, it's a shame what happened.   Now it's just another corporate-run machine that puts profit above all."
frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,BigDaddy47,4,Tue Jun 16 18:05:14 2015 UTC,Probably people abused the generosity though with the unlimited returns.  Select few ruining it for honest customers.  I'm amazed LL Bean still has their unlimited return policy.  You know some nuggets probably take their bean boots back from wearing them for 10 years and get a new pair for no defect reason other than they can.

frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,frENTlee,8,Wed Jun 17 04:59:21 2015 UTC,They've got more fit options on a lot of things and some nice touches on their chinos. Outside of that you're pretty much right.
frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,Brian175,6,Tue Jun 16 15:09:40 2015 UTC,Their chinos were nice but for the price there's a lot of great chino options out there

Fit is a bit superior though.  For example, their casual shirts fit me better.  J.Crew's button downs are a bit longer and don't look as good untucked. I don't pay full price for anything anyway.  I have a closet full of bonobos, mostly from when they used to run big discounts on the sale items and from the sample sale. Never paid full price for one item."

I've found their summer weight shirts to be superior to J Crew.  The big thing, though, is all their different fit options.  They're a great option for wool dress pants, their cords are super comfy, and they carry shirts in tall sizes.  But...I pretty much only buy their stuff on sale, because I think they're a bit overpriced normally.  Still, I think they're a nice step up from the various beginner brands."

Their shirts are no better than j crew -- outerwear and blazers are significantly worse imo.   But the chinos are honestly a cut above the other big brands. And the return policy, if you use it, makes up for the price differences."
frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,upvotes4pizza,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:43:31 2015 UTC,Their blazers fit me better than jcrew because the shoulders are slightly more narrow.  I am concerned though with the suits cause I'm not sure if they are fused or half canvased....
frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,HungryHippo44,4,Tue Jun 16 18:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of them. As a tall, slim dude that wears a 34x36, their Tailored Fit Chinos are the best fitting chinos I've come across...and I've tried every slim fit from J.Crew, BR, Dockers, Levi's. Their closest comparison is J.Crew and I find their Urban Slim is too loose and their 484s are both a little too snug and unavailable in my preferred 36 length.   I definitely recommend Bonobos to the tall and slim."

It's not really ""free"" like it's advertised, but it's a smart business model because people will perceive it that way."
frugalmalefashion,3a1gdu,rogrogrickroll,-3,Tue Jun 16 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"The business model should apply to all their items right? Their other items like shirts/pants are at least priced competitively (regular price and sale price) relative to similar brands, and that includes all the special CS/shipping. If that's the case, you would think their tees should be priced similarly when on sale. Instead they are much more expensive. One explanation would be their tees are of much better quality than the tees from similar brands (which I highly doubt) or they charge a ridiculous premium for their tees relative to their other products like their pants and shirts."

frugalmalefashion,3a2784,sabotourAssociate,10,Tue Jun 16 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"just FYI  Endclothing seems to have a customs fee threshold of 200 USD, so if you order something <200 you are most likely safe. some people have reported they havent gotten taxed on orders >200 so its not an absolute. either way, theres a 90% you will be taxed on orders >200  also, I think if the article of clothing is made in the US and you live in the US, it is not subject to customs fees.  if you want more info, dig around the last few pages of sf"
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,ambyance,6,Tue Jun 16 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"This is correct, I clear End Clothing shipments through Customs and anything under $200 is considered a 'non-entry' and should not incur any duties (with a few exceptions)"
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,zbaile1074,3,Tue Jun 16 23:26:28 2015 UTC,you can avoid customs if you order multiple shipments of <200 items but shipping will cost you $12/per. may be worth it to some
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,ambyance,2,Tue Jun 16 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"Could be, duty rates on clothing and shoes can be crazy. They can go up to 48% for some kinds of items."

frugalmalefashion,3a2784,LG18,2,Wed Jun 17 19:02:10 2015 UTC,only time will tell. youre most likely getting customs fees  use this https://www.dutycalculator.com/  and read http://www.styleforum.net/t/328145/official-customs-duties-and-international-shipping-questions-and-stories-thread/510

frugalmalefashion,3a2784,itsthumper,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:19:48 2015 UTC,I thought there is a $200 requirement to be charged custom fees.
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,zbaile1074,8,Tue Jun 16 22:50:59 2015 UTC,there is. The only way duties and taxes are assessed (in most cases) is if the declared value for the item is over $200.00. Any clothing under that amount should not have duties assessed.   source - work in customs brokerage
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,wigletbill,2,Tue Jun 16 23:16:35 2015 UTC,You'll probably be required to pay it to receive your package.
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,ambyance,3,Tue Jun 16 20:04:52 2015 UTC,no... customs letter comes after the package has arrived. they dont take away the package   edit: it depends on the delivery service

frugalmalefashion,3a2784,ambyance,3,Tue Jun 16 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"oh, i might be wrong actually. AFAIK, UPS has pretty draconian customs fee policies whereas fedex is quite lax (no payment required upon delivery)."
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,shakemyhandPLEASE,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:58:36 2015 UTC,How much is the customs tax typically?
frugalmalefashion,3a2784,ambyance,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - pay it off asap  if you dont, you will keep getting letters telling you to pay... eventually theyll get debt collectors to make you pay. it can actually hurt your credit score if you dont pay it off in time"

Lambskin lining, better quality and softer leather uppers, wheeled edging, special Independence sole...might be missing some stuff but that's the gist of it.

The Poron padded insoles make the shoe more comfortable out of the box, but some aficionados question if the Poron has the same longevity as a purely leather insole. The sole's rubber layer makes it last longer than a plain leather one, but some people prefer the aesthetic of leather soles over combination or full rubber.  The shoes are just cheaper because AE wants to keep the stock low. Brooks Brothers charges $43 more for them than AE charges for their AE-branded counterparts (Fifth Avenue, Strand, etc.)."

frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,fkviz,3,Tue Jun 16 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Just to follow up, everyone living in these states will have taxes applied to their order, so ordering just a pair will be sufficient to activate the offer."
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,fkviz,2,Tue Jun 16 19:34:12 2015 UTC,I live in Colorado and was charged tax on strands at $199. It pushed the total over $200 and I received the Amex deal.
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,civnoobie,0,Tue Jun 16 23:00:21 2015 UTC,The person I spoke to said that the subtotal before shipping and tax has to be below 200 bucks. She said that was the situation for the last Amex deal.
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,S_Truett_Catty,3,Wed Jun 17 11:54:21 2015 UTC,Don't worry about what the Allen Edmond employee said about the terms of the Amex deal. The AE charge that hits your Amex card has to total $200+ by the time the deal expires in September.  That can be any of the following: $199 shoes + tax $179 shoes today and an order in August for $21+ Or in my case... $199 + (no tax) + $2.50 shoelaces  The total that hits your Amex by September is what needs to trigger the offer.
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,DoctorBigtime,2,Tue Jun 16 20:41:28 2015 UTC,Things of note to me:   AE is discontinuing the Clark Street and Patriot.  Brown and burgundy shell Park Avenues are at the lowest prices I have ever seen them at in the last two years. Those will be cleaned out quickly.
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,Boobs_Are_Pleasant,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:37:54 2015 UTC,Are the shell PAs much better than the calfskins in terms of shoe quality and style?
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,spiesvsmercs,11,Tue Jun 16 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you like. The style is the exact same.  Shell cordovan is naturally shiny. You will rarely use polish on it. If you try to use polish on it the way you would with calfskin, it will end up duller rather than shinier. You'll never get shell to have a mirror finish, but it will always have a glazed look to it.  People also prefer shell's rolls as opposed to calfskin's creases. Shell doesn't show any fine lines in its flex points like calf does.  Shell is more resilient to weather and normal wear and tear. Shell doesn't absorb water like calf does. It is more prone to having it bead on the surface. Minor scuffs and scrapes can be buffed out of shell like nothing happened... all with just a buffing cloth or wet thumb. If that doesn't do the trick, a bit of shell cream or polish will make it disappear.  Basically, shell is a low maintenance leather that has a longer lifespan than calfskin.  Shoes out of the box - burgundy shell on left, calfskin on right  Black calf creases on left, black shell rolls on the right"
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,Citizen_V,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:54:11 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the excellent comparison. I actually prefer the less shiny nature of the calfskin but love the way the shell creases in that photo!

frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,duckslovequack,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"Bespoke shoes require a custom last for your individual feet. It would be akin to bespoke suits requiring the tailor to make a custom mannequin to build the suit on. Then they have the fittings to tweak it. Add on that only the top of the line shoemakers offer it, and you've got the reasons why bespoke shoes have a price floor of about $5,000."

They seem to have replaced that kind of volume sale with a $50 off your first pair, $75 off your second deal.  As for the tent question, yes, this was the scene when I was there last year. They have a literal tent set up in the Shoe Bank parking lot in Port Washington. But it technically doesn't start until Thursday, so I don't think the tent will be up until then."

I do have a Nordstrom and an AE store near me but the Nordstrom has a limited selection (definitely no Dalton) and the AE is way out the way sadly.

frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,oOoWTFMATE,2,Tue Jun 16 16:09:30 2015 UTC,The conventional wisdom was the 65 is half a size down and one width up from Brannock. 511 should be your Brannock.

frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,Citizen_V,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"I feel dumb for asking, but there is an Allen Edmonds close to where I live. Will they have the tent up front? Or do I need to find an Allen Edmond physical factory-seconds store? What if I just want to go browse a tent sale, how do I find the closest one to me?"
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,Citizen_V,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain the only literal tent will be in Port Washington, WI. The rest of the outlet stores will have these prices, but probably nothing else special going on.   A plain old Allen Edmonds store will be finishing up the Father's Day Sale and can't help you with ordering seconds directly. But you could go there to look at styles and try stuff for sizing."
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,snowtreds,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"Okay so let's say I wanted to participate in this tent sale. The only way is for me to do it via ordering online or calling an outlet store and having them ship to me, is that right?  I can't just go browse the selection of what's on sale myself?"
frugalmalefashion,3a1ezo,Citizen_V,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:52:36 2015 UTC,"So, the website linked up above is a list of the seconds inventory as of early this morning. The inventory is not uniform from store to store, and a good amount of it is in a warehouse in Wisconsin too.  So you're free to check out what that AE store near you has, but it won't have everything that's listed as available in your size on the website. If it's a regular, non-outlet AE store, it won't have anything listed at those prices because they don't sell seconds.  If you decide you want to buy something, you call one of the outlet stores/warehouse that has the shoe in stock (if you click on the shoe, the page it takes you to has more info on the shoe and a list of places that have it in that particular size), online ordering isn't available. You give them your credit card and shipping info, and they ship it to you. If you end up not wanting it, you can ship them back and then they charge a $10 restocking fee, or you can return it to that local store and the $10 fee will likely be waived."

If you get a chance and you like what you see, vote for the guys to receive this mission&main street grant so they can expand a bit!"
frugalmalefashion,3a5hnz,akaghi,0,Wed Jun 17 11:46:37 2015 UTC,"This shop is pretty cool. Their packaging and branding is really top notch. To me, some of the items feel a bit expensive. Not in the These jeans cost more than $40 sense either.  I made soap for awhile, and you can get soap for much much less. $14 for 6 oz is crazy to me.  I'm not going to comment on the gold and copper art piece axes.  $30 beard oil?  Also, are the Chippewa boots from their special line? Because if they're just the regular run on the mill ones, those prices are obnoxious. But if they're a part of their higher tier line, then the price is probably better.  Anyway, the shop is cool, the prices just seem marked up a bit to me, especially the apothecary stuff. Their shell cordovan wallets are a bit crazy too."

frugalmalefashion,3a1sm1,Whind_Soull,2,Wed Jun 17 17:12:49 2015 UTC,I guess that's one area where I generally skimp or try to grab some jcrew softwash on sale; I can't figure out why a t-shirt should ever by $15+.

For an undershirt, long is okay but these are originally meant as training shirts. It would be a bad undershirt anyway because it's so baggy and it has a crewneck collar. Sizing down isn't really an option since I have wide shoulders and the size I got are barely wide enough.

frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,PriceZombie,6,Mon Jun 15 23:50:31 2015 UTC,I have this watch and can attest that it looks really great in person! The price is also the lowest I have ever seen it go and as a automatic it keeps great time as the movement in it is actually quite good.
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,gonltruck,8,Mon Jun 15 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to clarify that automatic movements keep worse time than quartz. They are usually more desirable due to the craftsmanship and intricacy required to build, not for their time-keeping qualities."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,TheBeesSteeze,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"I have a question.  If you only wear an automatic watch once every month, will it stop moving while in storage?"
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,gonltruck,6,Mon Jun 15 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah it will. Automatic watches wind (""charge"") their movements by movement on your wrist. Some will feature a manual wind on the crown also. The only way to keep them moving in storage is to use a watch winder, like this for example (watch the video for an explanation.)   Although this will keep them moving so you won't have to reset the time every time you go to wear the watch, it causes more wear on the movement and the watch will require more regular servicing than if you were to allow it to wind itself down and re-set the time yourself."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,trilll,2,Mon Jun 15 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe a stupid question but can if you wear it once then put it away for a month then wear it again, can't you just set the time to what it is when you put it back on, and then it will start working again since it will have movement on your wrist?  Is it really that bad to not wear the watch everyday or what would be the down side of the situation I described?"
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,gonltruck,4,Mon Jun 15 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"No that is perfectly normal. My daily wearer has a power reserve (""charge"" - if you like) of 36 hours. Often I won't wear it on the weekend when I wear something nicer. Usually by Monday it will need to be re-set, so I set the time again, put it on my wrist and I'm good to go.  It only takes the smallest movement to get it going again."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,trilll,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:28:51 2015 UTC,So then why do people even care if automatics are less accurate then quartz? I don't see why it would matter at all if you simply have to set it to the correct time for the day you're wearing it. There's no negative at all to letting it sit without movement for extended periods of time?
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,gonltruck,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Well, on the odd occasion that I wear my daily for a month without having to set it again, it will be about 7 minutes fast by the end of the month. But yeah there isn't really a negative, unless your talking about letting it sit for years on end - then it might cause problems requiring servicing."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,TheBeesSteeze,-6,Mon Jun 15 23:53:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, people pay $160 to keep their watch properly winded (wound?) in storage, what a niche item"
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,coocookuhchoo,2,Mon Jun 15 23:10:24 2015 UTC,"They are particularly useful on things like annual calendars or moonphases, which are a pain in the ass to reset once they stop"

frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,thejedion,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"My automatic watch has a 1461 movement.  That is to say it tracks the date very similarly to a ""perpetual calendar"", so even on February 29th it accurately displays the date.   To set this is quite a process so I appreciate having a winder if I am ever planning on letting it stop for longer than a day.  Edit: it also has a moonphase, and as coocoo stated, its not the most enjoyable thing to ""eyeball"" set."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,MGNero3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:28:45 2015 UTC,I have never had an issue with my automatic keeping accurate time.
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,gonltruck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on your definition of accurate. Losing/gaining only 5 seconds a day might not seem like much, but it's half an hour a year."

frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,efitz11,6,Mon Jun 15 19:37:06 2015 UTC,I know this may be sacrilege but does anyone know of a quartz watch that looks similar?
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,shirtpantloafer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:58:23 2015 UTC,"It will be hard to find the exact watch face design. But, Orient Capital looks pretty similar."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,theloniousfunkd,3,Mon Jun 15 20:19:49 2015 UTC,My only issue with the cocktail time is the thickness.  If it was slimmer it would be much more sleek.  It's slightly clunky but I love the face and hands. Reminds me of the 60's.
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,Micrafone_AssAssin,3,Mon Jun 15 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"I have an Orient bambino and it's the same thickness, and it isn't that bad. The domed glass gives it just under half the thickness, but visually it lends the appearance of being flat and thin."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,xolieo,5,Mon Jun 15 19:06:50 2015 UTC,I don't own one but based on the specs this is a pretty standard thickness for an automatic watch in this price range.
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,theloniousfunkd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:34:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know, the re-craft series are considered pretty large and only 12 mm thick. A mm less than the cocktail time.  http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SNKN02-Display-Automatic-Leather/dp/B00MBB0LGY/ref=sr_1_18?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1434390687&sr=1-18&keywords=seiko+dress+watch+automatic"
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,xolieo,3,Mon Jun 15 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"12mm for an automatic is actually on the smaller side. I would expect 13-14 from most unless you are pushing into the $1,500+ range. Do you know of any automatic watches with a sub 10mm profile? I certainly don't."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,Citizen_V,4,Mon Jun 15 17:57:25 2015 UTC,It's actually fairly easily achievable with a thinner movement like the ETA 2892 which can be found in sub $1000 watches. My Eterna KonTiki from the 1990s is 8-9mm thick and still has 200m WR. A modern example is the Hamilton Intra-matic which is 7mm thick (some sites incorrectly list it as 10mm+). just under 10mm at 9.76mm. Unfortunately there aren't that many that slim and 12-13mm is much more common.
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,subliminalcriminal9,3,Mon Jun 15 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yep the Hamilton Intramatic uses that movement. Even though it's listed at 10mm,  about 2.5mm is from doming of the sapphire, so it wears like a 7.5mm. Bought mine for $509 off jomashop and absolutely adore it.. Only problem is it doesn't have a seconds hand."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,Citizen_V,3,Mon Jun 15 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, shoot. You are correct. I don't know why owners are measuring it without the domed crystal (you don't see others doing it other watches), but all the reported 7mm are indeed without the crystal included."
frugalmalefashion,39xcx0,subliminalcriminal9,2,Mon Jun 15 22:51:26 2015 UTC,I guess it's because it really wears like a 7mm; the doming is gradual and not immediately pronounced from the edges.

I swear I've seen people mention this on MFA and here before, but never pay full price for any of these high end sunglass brands. Persol's, Rayban's, etc. are always on some kind of sale somewhere."
frugalmalefashion,39y80w,theseanho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:26:52 2015 UTC,Do you know why I can't use the $300 on Tom Ford? Can you show me where in the terms they are banned? I made sure to read the terms and did not see Tom Ford anywhere. I'm about to call CC company to cancel because this is stupid.

frugalmalefashion,39y80w,theseanho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:54:38 2015 UTC,I didn't think this deal had too many restrictions. The excluded brands are clearly listed. Unless there's terms hidden somewhere (I've looked everywhere) I don't think Tom Ford is supposed to be excluded. And if it is then that's false advertisement and I'm just going to contact my bank to get a refund. But yeah I probably won't participate in any of these deals in the future... Things don't work like they're supposed to...

Shoulders just didn't look/sit right on me and were too padded and rippled at the seams even after I sent it back for added alterations. My brother got one and he looked much better. Fabric was very soft but too shiny (110s maybe), better to the touch than the average cheaper Italian wools used in J. Crew suits. Results will vary."

The regular is longer and roomier than the Nordstrom trim fit, which is my perfect fitting size.  But the Ledbury isn't overly billowy by any means.   I believe Nordstrom carries Ledbury as well, so you should try both out."

Not only are you paying for Uniqlo in $USD, but you have to factor in gas cost or duties/shipping cost, and also the fact that you pretty much cant return anything. Might as well just shop at the Gap or something in the meantime."
frugalmalefashion,39zkr1,FiletMcShay,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:22:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's not a perfect strategy, but it's still useful. I only order from Uniqlo when I'm going down for another reason, so there is no extra travel cost. I'm buying items from Uniqlo that I really enjoy, and which are a good deal even with the conversion.  I prefer to wait to buy Uniqlo stuff until I'm already going down to the States. I'm not in a rush to buy any of this stuff, so there's no need to buy a substitute and item I like less.  It will definitely be nice when I can just have it shipped straight to my house, though!"
frugalmalefashion,39zkr1,tarzannnn,2,Tue Jun 16 03:44:57 2015 UTC,A few questions:   the Vanilla card is in CDN currency?  what billing address did you use for the card? did you ship to a receiving company?
frugalmalefashion,39zkr1,tarzannnn,2,Tue Jun 16 03:02:30 2015 UTC,"the card is in Canadian $$, so you have to account for that. I should mention that there is an activation fee and a currency conversion fee ($6 activation, 2.5% fx fee) I had items sent to a friend's house, and used that shipping address as the billing address.    EDIT: I bought US$77.00 worth of items, and the charge on my card was CAD$95.00. Add $6.00 for the activation fee and total cost was CAD$101.00."

For one, this sale is much more well-known than previous ones (I would think), so there will be more people that scooped up during the 50% portion. And also you can't expect high end selection if you're not paying high end prices.  All I ended up with was cufflinks, a sweater, a pair of jeans, and four candles."

They had already refunded my card before calling, refused to do a back order and then stuck me with a $30 credit and no shoes. Needless to say I wasn't too satisfied.

frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,thechoipolloi,7,Mon Jun 15 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"I ordered these boots when they were $90 and returned them. The quality was fairly poor on mine--poor leather, stitching wasn't straight, the welt was huge, and the boots were really heavy (about 840 grams per boot).  I can confirm that they're made by Altama, which the box said.  For now I'll stick with the Alico Tahoes I bought for ~$110 (http://www.sierratradingpost.com/alico-tahoe-hiking-boots-for-men~p~63669/). They're norwegian welted, with really good workmanship and really good leather. They're also around 750 grams per boot, rather than 840. The only downside is that they aren't gore-tex lined, but in this case the quality is worth it.  I don't usually agree with the Made-in-China-sucks mentality, but in this case, the haters are right.  If you're still interested after all that, I'll note that the 9.5D was slightly small (especially for a boot)--I'd get the 10D if I bought again, versus a 9.5D in the Alico Tahoe."
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,ucbiker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"Since those Alicos aren't Goretex, are they at all waterproof?"

They aren't exactly waterproof, but I haven't had any issues with them in moderate rain and going through shallow puddles."
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,promethiac,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"I have a pair that I locked in at 90 and am in the process of exchanging for a different size. Is the leather really that bad? I mean it doesn't seem on par with my iron rangers, but I'm no expert. The weight isn't a problem as I won't be using them on long hikes. Mostly interested in a boot that can handle a bit of snow."
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,thechoipolloi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm also no expert, and sometimes people have different views on what leather quality is. The industry standard used to be (and still is in some places) to ""grade"" a hide based on what part of the cow the leather came from, which captures differences between parts of the cow (but not differences between cows).   Basically what you want from leather is (a) tight fiber and (b) consistent grain. Tight fiber means it needs to come from a good hide, and from a good part of that hide, and it helps to ensure longevity and waterproofness. Consistent grain also depends on the cow and part of the cow, but also on the manufacturer's skill in clicking (cutting; not sure if there's a different term for boots). Consistent grain is mostly an aesthetic issue.   In this case, the fiber was very loose, and the grain was inconsistent, not to mention actually blemished in a few places. I would say that the leather my boots were made of were 3rd (or perhaps even 4th) grade from a doubtful hide. See here: http://oldleathershoe.com/wordpress/?attachment_id=553  The manufacturer tried to cover some of this up by going for the shrunken leather look (this is a common trick, although I like shrunken leather and it certainly has its place in certain shoes, like loafers), but the low-quality leather will compromise the longevity of the shoe, and it's hard to look past the low quality when you know that it's there."
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,TriDeeDana,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:33:22 2015 UTC,If you are looking for good hiking boots try the Italian made Zamberlans.  Excellent quality.  I have had both the the Vioz and Skill and can recommend them both.  Campsaver has the Skill for 172 right now.  EMS has the Vioz for 179 last week but that's over.  Unfortunately for the they had every size but mine.
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,TenThousandSuns,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"I am by no means an ultralight hiker, but those look hella heavy.  How do they feel on a hike?  Stability, grip, etc.?"
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,TriDeeDana,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"They are heavy.  Full grain leather, thick Vibram soles - could be used for backpacking.  The Skills are a bit lighter but not a lot.  The stability is excellent.  There are a lot of rocks on trails here so I appreciate the sturdiness.  But they also look really good (at least until you beat them up on the rocks). Both times when I bought a pair I considered reserving them for street use.  I have 3 boots which I rotate fairly evenly.  The Zamberlans are holding up the best of the three.  They will last a very long time, and I am pretty sure they can be rebuilt.  Fit might be an issue.  I get a full size larger in the Skill and a size and a half larger for the Vioz.  My wife gets a full size larger in the Vioz.  It seems venders list them as true to size, so don't know what gives - just know what I wear.  Campsaver will let you exchange size 1 time for free."
frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,TriDeeDana,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:20:39 2015 UTC,I checked and they are much lighter than my Trickers Stowes - seem comparable in weight to Iron Rangers.

frugalmalefashion,39vwp2,promethiac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:00:16 2015 UTC,Most hikers are better off with something closer to a sneaker or sandal - I look at these as more of a snow boot.

If you look at the picture the thigh to the ankle is a dark blue instead of the same indigo color you see from far away  It means your jeans will be a mix of two colors instead of solely one color. It is at that point a preference thing

If you're more comfortable with 511s or 512s then these will be too baggy for you. At this price point you could normally justify tailoring a pair of pants I guess. However, tailoring selvage gets tricky and more tricky = more pricy.  If you aren't sure on this purchase then again, I suggest trying them on or giving this a pass. I've found 501s and 501 STFs at Marshalls/Ross at around $20/pair before and did not buy. They were too baggy for my tastes."

frugalmalefashion,39t002,diatho,2,Mon Jun 15 02:03:37 2015 UTC,depending on the type of office you will work in is that many people will rotate a basic set of shirts with different ties. you can wear a white shirt 5 days a week but change the tie. also no one expects you to have a large wardrobe.   what i did was buy a few basic shirts that were versatile.

I currently do not have any watches but want to start a collection. Please let me know which one you guys think is the better of the two. Thank you! http://accessories.woot.com/offers/august-steiner-mens-watch-7?ref=cnt_wp_5_8[1] http://accessories.woot.com/offers/akribos-xxiv-mens-watch-43?ref=cnt_wp_5_1[2] http://www.jomashop.com/skagen-watch-skw6104.html
frugalmalefashion,39t002,Citizen_V,2,Wed Jun 17 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Neither of the first two are reputable brands. They're not gonna break in a year and are okay quality, but I would not recommend them unless you're in love with the designs.  An alternative to the August Steiner is the Citizen BM8470 which comes in an assortment of colors, and Citizen is an extremely reputable brand with great quality. These are around $100 though. There are many other (cheaper) field watches if you just like the general style.  The Akribos is basically a homage to the Swiss Railroad clocks and Mondaine watches. They're pretty pricey though due to the design and Swiss Made label. They're at least $150, and Mondaine's black lugless case like that is discontinued. If you love the design, you may not have any better alternative.  From a style point of view, I would recommend the Akribos of the two. However, if you haven't already, consider the classic recommendations like the Timex Weekender, Seiko 5 809, etc. There are a number of good affordable watch guides floating around, like this post.  Skagen is always okay. They're a tad thin and can be fragile, but decent quality and designs."

frugalmalefashion,39rjee,Nfnite_Discontinuity,2,Sun Jun 14 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"Weren't the oxfords and chinos a different thing altogether? I think they were being sold below wholesale, to keep a factory in business. I could be wrong.  But, yeah, I would definitely call F&T and ask for garment measurements before buying anything."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,MichaelKeyes1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"yeah that was definitely a different thing, but I recall in the thread he had said it would be the last price reduction or something to that effect.   I'm also a little peeved because I wanted to exchange some denim and was told that I could not because they don't keep inventory, and very soon after they did the returned denim sale, with plenty of sizes. I just got a stock response I assume, makes me wonder why everyone says their customer service is excellent."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,Nfnite_Discontinuity,0,Mon Jun 15 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"Nah, not last price reduction, last below wholesale. And he said it during the Tough Slacks deal, the Chino/OCBD deal was earlier. http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/2x5l2t/flint_and_tinder_chino_prefund_35/ http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/305511/flint_and_tinder_prefund_tough_twill_slacks_3950/  The way that Tough Slacks sale worked, neither F&T nor the factory made a profit. The factory just got enough money to pay their workers and not go bankrupt- F&T probably ended up losing money, especially with people using coupons for free socks and shipping. And they'd already done a below wholesale deal for the same factory once before, with the Chino/OCBD thing, so I'm guessing that F&T's line of thinking was that even if the money from the second sale still wasn't enough to keep the factory open, then they couldn't/wouldn't do another one.  As to the failed exchange, it was probably that they didn't have your size in stock at the moment, but got a few returns afterwards. You should've asked them to notify you if they got returns in your size. Also, when you emailed F&T CS, how polite were you? Asking for an exchange on a prefunded item is basically asking for a favor, you've gotta at least be very polite if you expect to get anywhere."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,MichaelKeyes1,0,Mon Jun 15 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"That's not true, they very cleverly said they were not ""Marketing"" them up. Quote from the prefund: They agreed to manufacture them at zero mark-up (read: no profit for the factory owners, just uninterrupted paychecks to the employees) so we could sell more. We’re not marketing them up either (not a single penny!) and we’re passing 100% of the savings on to you!”"
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,tesoro12,0,Mon Jun 15 05:33:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, you actually threw me for a loop there, especially since the page for the OCBDs contains the same spelling error- but I am pretty sure it was just a spelling error. They must've copied and pasted that part of the description from one of the items to the other. After spending more time than I probably should've searching the Internet (like I said, you actually really threw me for a loop) I found a screenshot of the Tough Slacks deal. The spelling was corrected for that one.  http://archive.is/FFvkJ  Still a good catch on your part, though."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,MichaelKeyes1,7,Mon Jun 15 06:11:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I think I'll chime in since F+T seems to be getting dogged pretty hard and I had a relatable experience. I jumped on the Tough Pants a few months ago. There was some question about sizing (I wear 32-33 waist in just about everything) and I was told to go with the 32. So the pants finally came and there was NO WAY. Not even close to being able to button them. So I contact customer support and am told (pursuant to the return exchange policy) that the best I can get on prefund merch is store credit. So I paid about $70 for two pair of pants, that would get me $70 in store credit, and the cheapest pair of pants no the website were $105. I'd have to return two pair of pants and pay an additional $35 plus shiiping to end up with one pair of pants that fit. I was not thrilled.  So I sent a polite email to customer service (and a polite message to Jake on his Reddit account), waited about two weeks, and got an email back that someone had returned the pants in 34 waist and they'd happily exchange them, postage paid. I jumped at the chance and threw them in the mail the next afternoon. A few days later, I get a package with a pair of Khaki 34s and a pair of olive 32s. Sigh. So the 34s fit perfectly and I love them. I email customer service again and get a very polite and friendly apology and an offer to AGAIN swap the olive 32s for 34s. I threw them in the mail the next day, but had to leave the country before the package came in again. Hopefully there are 34s waiting when I get home.  Moral of the story: sizing is wonky, exchange policy is imperfect for prefund, customer service is excellent, and the pants are among the nicest I've ever owned."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,JohnFest,2,Sun Jun 14 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really like the tough slacks now that I have a pair that fit, but I definitely learned to call F&amp;T and get garment measurements before ordering anything. I heard on reddit that the previous run of them had a fair bit of vanity sizing, so I sized one down from true. The run we ordered from did not have any vanity sizing at all. I hate vanity sizing, but it's so common that if you don't use it, you really have to make sure and let your customers know.  I know that a lot of people had the same problem we did, so hopefully F&amp;T learned a lesson.  Good news is that you've got something to look forward to when you get home. The olive color uses a different fabric than the navy and khaki- 50/50 Nyco instead of 65/35 Polyco. It's the same stuff used in the original M-65 (as well as Outliers' Nyco Slims) so it's impossible to get a ""truer"" olive. I really love the color. Wish I'd ordered another pair of olives (and a pair of the khakis.)"
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,MichaelKeyes1,2,Sun Jun 14 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"I bought their regular raw denim a few weeks ago when they had it half off. I bought the slim fit which isn't very slim. They fit similar to my size 34 N&F SkinnyGuys but not as slim as my Strike Gold 3109s. Denim is definitely sanforized. It's a good pair of beaters and hot weather jeans as they're lighter weight than anything else I have, I believe they were 12oz.  Overall, good fit and good construction. I wouldn't pay more than the $50 I bought them for though as they're basic entry level denim."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,rpdos,6,Sun Jun 14 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"Piss-poor information on fit. Their ""size chart"" doesn't even distinguish between the two different styles. No info on dimensions at knee, leg opening, etc. What a joke."
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,Rhett_Rick,13,Sun Jun 14 06:38:05 2015 UTC,"There's a good size guide here. And if you check the How to Measure section, you'll see the rise measurements don't include the waistband for some reason, so take that into account.  How do I know this? Because I spent almost a week trying to figure out their sizing. Jake, the founder of F&T, came to /r/denim a few weeks ago to announce a sale on some overstock denim and said he'd answer all our questions, but he clearly didn't know much about them and disappeared. Their customer support was pretty unhelpful too.  So, in googling this brand and asking for help from other redditors, I also learned that Jake has basically has spent his entire adult life doing wacky things to get attention. He's a showman and a huckster. With Flint & Tinder, he saw an opportunity, created a brand, and marketed the hell out of it. He's obviously great at what he does, but it really doesn't make me want to buy clothes from him."

I like that the bottom of the back pockets are reinforced. My complaints would be that they were incorrectly labelled as unsanforized, and the rise is pretty low/tight so my boys can be slightly visible. I don't mean a moose knuckle, but, well it's a little too tight. Waist is perfect, but I wish they added an 1"" to the front and back.   Overall, they were worth my $50"

frugalmalefashion,39rjee,todayismyluckyday,2,Sun Jun 14 03:00:34 2015 UTC,Or 36. I get that they have limited production capabilities but it's frustrating.
frugalmalefashion,39rjee,oscargamble,2,Sun Jun 14 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"I have about a 30"" natural inseam, so you'd think these 32's would only be a couple of inches too long, but on my pair I can give them 3 2"" turns and just barely clear the break.  I concede that F&T's sizing is a bit wonky, but not any more than any other internet merchant I've dealt with.  Frankly I always assumed I had some weirdo body type, so on some level this thread is comforting.    I got the 36x32 slim 1968's and they're big in the waist.  I contacted F&T and they were perfectly cool about me exchanging them for 34x32.  To save myself the hassle, I went ahead an ordered the 2nd pair and told them I'd return the one I didn't like for a refund, which I did and they did.  It was easy.  I haven't had ANY of the customer service problems folks describe.  FWIW, I couldn't button the 34x32's.  So they went from too big to way too small in a single size.  Since then I've been soaking the 36's and even popped them in the dryer.  They don't fit quite like I intended them to, however my wife likes them.  They're just some cool jeans to wear, and that's that.  She thinks the denim scene is choked with dudes being waaaaaaay too precious about their pants, and she's probably right.  To that end, I like these $50-$60 USA jeans."

He only bad thing I have HEARD of but not dealt with personally is that certain if not all straps are hard to replace because you have to buy them directly from skagen and they can be expensive. Maybe there are alternatives or cheap knock offs. But straps seem to be a turn off for some people. All in all, I love my skagen and would definitely buy again. Thinking about buying some as a gift. Also have gotten many compliments. Good luck!! Edit: I also try to be careful with the face but have accidentally had a few concerns where it rubbed against something rough. The face evidently does not scratch easily!"
frugalmalefashion,39q57x,differing,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:14:17 2015 UTC,"They look great, but the build quality isn't amazing. My first watch broke without fault, which they repaired, but the repaired watch broke as well (the numbers fell off!). The contractor for repairs also switched between both issues, so they seem to be having issues."
frugalmalefashion,39q57x,ben010783,-1,Sat Jun 13 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"Others have talked about the quality, but my biggest gripe is that they use non-standard watch bands.  Their greatest asset is that the watches are so slim.  The Seiko Orange Monster is an example of a watch that watch snobs like, but it is extremely bulky compared to most Skagens.  I try not to spend over $100 USD on Skagens (because I don't the features warrant a higher price) and I avoid Skagens with leather straps (because they wear faster and you have fewer options).  I think they're a good choice if you want a cheap, fashionable watch, but if you want to get more serious about watches, there are better watches."
frugalmalefashion,39q57x,MichaelKeyes1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:51:39 2015 UTC,"A Seiko 5 is another example of a watch that watch snobs like, and a lot of them are decently slim as well as less expensive than Skagen. Good watches come in all shapes and most budgets."

frugalmalefashion,39q57x,DeltaDP,2,Sun Jun 14 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"I own about 10 of these watches and love everyone one of them! The strap of one kinda torn apart but I wear it daily for over five years, and still my favorite watch to wear. I like the mesh but prefers the leather."
frugalmalefashion,39q57x,This_Is_A_Robbery,5,Sun Jun 14 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"I've seen these a lot cheaper during Amazon sales. Not a amazing watch by any standards, the construction on the watch I got made it so that once it was broken it could only be repaired by glue. Made with soft crappy metal so the band can get bent.   Can't really recommend it but I don't think it's a horrible watch for ~60-70 bucks. I definitely like the look."

frugalmalefashion,39odiy,SushiShark522,6,Sat Jun 13 05:33:42 2015 UTC,Don't buy from JCF right now unless you are buying something on clearance.
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,AshtonEV,5,Sat Jun 13 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, I feel bad when JCF ""sales"" get posted and read the comments of people that bought things that werent on clearance.  They only time buying from JCF makes sense is when they have a % off clearance and when sales overlap during the couple hours prices change on the site. All other times the prices on their stuff are around the same price regardless of what ""sale"" they have going on."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,HipposLoveCereal,3,Sat Jun 13 23:47:33 2015 UTC,Exactly. I am thinking of making a list of what prices you should be buying stuff at if you want maximum sales.
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,AshtonEV,2,Sun Jun 14 00:15:07 2015 UTC,When do the sales overlap?
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,omlaplata,5,Sun Jun 14 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"Explained in another thread:   At the end of the 50% off sale, they won't change the prices on the items until around 4 AM the next day. JCF almost always follows up flat-rate sales with promo code sales for 20-30% off. These promo codes are available at 12AM, so there is a 4 hour window where you can stack the new promo code and the previous 50% off sale.   This particular sale ends ""June 14, 2015, 11:59pm ET."" There may or may not be a discount code after. IIRC, last time the just did a similar sale again so there was no overlap."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,Citizen_V,3,Sun Jun 14 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"The clearance items are final-sale. The website doesn't say clearly whether the 60%-off sale applies to online purchases, which is annoying because there's a sweater I want to buy online to which the promo code doesn't apply."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,Benfird,2,Sat Jun 13 05:38:42 2015 UTC,"Their wording is a bit unclear, what they mean is up to 60% off and that price is marked already, the promo code is only for 40% extra off the sale section. (They seem to often pair an as marked ""discount"" with a separate code)"
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,yourfriendkyle,0,Sat Jun 13 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the up-to-60% discount would apply to the sweater I wish to buy, but the EXTRA40 promo code wouldn't, if I understand you correctly."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,DasDo0kie,2,Sat Jun 13 06:17:51 2015 UTC,"So I checked the price of the Reade short?before this ""sale"" started and they were $25 but now that the ""sale"" is on they're $35?  I don't get it."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,yourfriendkyle,9,Sat Jun 13 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome to J. Crew pricing, their prices fluctuates based on current promotions, so you basically have to have a TI-83 out to figure out if you are actually saving money.  How is this legal you might ask? I don't know, but similar retailer tactics are being brought into question and been brought into court.  Edit: JCF still makes decent items for their prices and is well-liked in this sub, I just personally detest their pricing policies. Maybe what they are doing is very different from JCPenny (getting sued), but to me they are deceiving all the same."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,ajenius620,3,Sat Jun 13 08:15:33 2015 UTC,Oh for sure on all of that. I usually have a price point at which I'll buy the prices and I kind of just ignore whatever sale they have going on..
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,yourfriendkyle,3,Sat Jun 13 12:55:37 2015 UTC,"That's the way I think about it... if something is a certain price and I think it's worth it, I'll probably get it.  Sometimes I don't want to be blinded by how much % off MSRP I'll get it for.  It does help if you've been watching an item's price history, though.  In the end, it's the final price that matters.  Too many people bitch and moan about them raising prices, and that's understandable.  But it happens so much that it's expected.  If you wanted to get something last week because the price was lower than this week and it was at your price point, you should have gotten it last week.  Or just wait until there's another ""promo"" that'll bring it down next week."
frugalmalefashion,39odiy,TheMightyGhost,4,Sat Jun 13 14:23:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I may start a price spreadsheet for j crew factory just to get a decent idea of what is actually ""cheap"" for them."

To me it was quick and easy, low investment of time at a good price. Was it the absolute cheapest ever? No. I got a 15$ Jcrew off of thrift prep, but shipping is like 6 bucks. I could have bought a lot more to bring the average price down, to average out the shipping. I have spent a lot of time searching for bargain shoe's, I am not gonna spend that much time looking for every article of clothing I buy. At some point their are diminishing returns. I understand the joy of the hunt, but for me this transaction was pretty ideal."

The issue is that the global/international LLBean links will redirect from the original promotional URL to the given link's international/global hosted counterpart. Normally this won't really impact usability, but not every URL from the normal site exists within the international one.   I'll do some digging and send you the correct link (if it exists).  My international proxy is down at the moment (unrelated to the URL), but I'd recommend going to the main global llbean website (just click the ""Home Page"" link you're seeing at the error page), then going to the Sale page. The /llb/shop/32 is essentially the same as that, the redirect is just problematic with the data strings benign appended to them."

frugalmalefashion,39lz8u,bareju,7,Fri Jun 12 20:54:58 2015 UTC,"What question are you asking?  They are dress shirts, and should be worn tucked with formal wear. When tucked, it is best to avoid any unnecessary fabric as it looks bad to have bunching in a tucked shirt. If you were to untuck this shirt and wear it over pants, it would be too tight and have pulling at the waist.  By casually, I mean wearing with the top button unbuttoned and untucked. You are better off with another shirt if planning on wearing it that way.  Last point: my shirt has a sizeable tag on the bottom of the placket (as many dress shirts do). While removable with a seam ripper, it just adds to the idea that it was designed to be worn tucked"
frugalmalefashion,39lz8u,robotic_lemur,2,Fri Jun 12 22:55:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, I was more asking what you meant by casual. I wouldn't ever wear a dress shirt untucked anyways so that's not an issue."

When it came in i went and ordered two more button downs. My opinion is that theyre exponentially better. Keeps the collar nice and straight and frames your fave really well, and prevents the collar from wrinkling. Its my understanding they are the same shirt except for the buttons. Some with pockets.   Also, for sizing, everything uniqlo i wear close to my body (t shirts, polos, linen, broadcloth) is size S and anything outwear is M for the most part.

As for the quality, I'm not sure. They're a solid feeling thick cotton-polyester blend, but I can't speak for the longevity of them as I've never owned one. They seem comfortable and probably durable, but I don't have much experience with them in that regard. For $5.90 though you could do worse."

frugalmalefashion,39l7na,senornonsequitur,2,Sat Jun 13 04:42:12 2015 UTC,I'm starting a new job and need to buy dress shirts that will not be worn with a tie. What type of collars would work best for this situation? I have ocbd's and like the button down but I'm not sure if the other types would be more appropriate.  Thank you!
frugalmalefashion,39l7na,nwphoto,3,Fri Jun 12 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"it depends more on your job, and also the type of pants you are going to be wearing with them.  For wool dress pants or dressier slacks, go with a regular collar that has collar stays.  Spread collars are really only for ties.  button down collars are the most casual (like your ocbd), and look good tucked or untucked with jeans or chinos.  the fabric style also matters alot, smoother fabrics are more formal than rough ones like oxford. hope that helps"
frugalmalefashion,39l7na,Prince_Uncharming,2,Fri Jun 12 21:49:05 2015 UTC,I really do wish they had some more brighter colors for v-neck shirts...

frugalmalefashion,39kskt,sunlandia21,9,Fri Jun 12 15:58:34 2015 UTC,I wish Red Fleece fit better.  BB doesn't seem to be able to get a slim fit right for my body type.  Always ends up billowy in the back like I should be growing a beer gut back over my ass to fill the shirt out.
frugalmalefashion,39kskt,Walter_Crunkite_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:57:33 2015 UTC,Check out their xtra slim fits. Online only. I think they got renamed to Milano fit.

I have both ESF shirts and Red Fleece and I honestly can't tell which is slimmer. /u/scholl43 is right about them being billowy in the back. In my opinion they fit about the same, RF might be a tad slimmer but functionally there's not much of a difference."

frugalmalefashion,39kskt,BLOPES,2,Fri Jun 12 13:45:30 2015 UTC,Isn't that because they aren't meant to be tucked in?
frugalmalefashion,39kskt,sunlandia21,0,Sat Jun 13 00:21:59 2015 UTC,Almost no other brands make sport shirts with straight cut hems. It's just a shitty design.  You don't have to tuck a curved hem and you can tuck a straight hem.

Comparable slim fits of all the other brands you mentioned all have shorter sleeves: Uniqlo-35 3/4; JCrew - 35-36; and Gap -35 1/2.

frugalmalefashion,39m9mj,hax_wut,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:29:11 2015 UTC,MSRP is $130. According to PriceZombie this is about the lowest they have been in a year. A few weeks ago an ebay seller had them for $69.99.  Main (only?) difference is crepe vs rubber soles.
frugalmalefashion,39m9mj,eddrix,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:31:54 2015 UTC,I only ask because I see Bushacre go for around 70-80 all the time.
frugalmalefashion,39m9mj,hax_wut,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:35:15 2015 UTC,Supposedly the leather is higher quality in these than the Bushacre. In my opinion it's the crepe sole.   I own a pair of the Bushacre and like them a lot. The sole is relatively uncomfortable but they're a quality pair of boots.

frugalmalefashion,39gnbg,Urnquei,0,Thu Jun 11 21:22:35 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. But the new spring bars keep falling out. I think the metal bits on the watch they connect to are slightly bent. (This making the gap larger.) :/ Shame since I really liked the watch.
frugalmalefashion,39gnbg,Citizen_V,3,Thu Jun 11 21:41:28 2015 UTC,The watch lugs? Were they damaged when the watch fell?

frugalmalefashion,39gnbg,Urnquei,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:31:32 2015 UTC,Probably. I've replaced the spring bars a few times now and it doesn't work. The lugs look visually bent to my eyes.

They are pretty inexpensive and easy to replace (you'll probably need a spring-bar tool as well)  Alternatively, using a NATO style strap will keep your watch from falling should a spring bar fail.

That said, I already own that pair of suede wingtips, and they're definitely worth the $285 clearance price. The suede is so much nicer than cheaper stuff, and like other Trickers, the construction is top notch.  The chukkas and Langston boots are also very nice, and the coupon price is a great deal."

frugalmalefashion,39g7hv,mmencius,3,Thu Jun 11 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"Actually my ULD hoodie is very warm and fairly slim. It is definitely not bulky. It's not -30 degrees with wind chill level warm but pretty decent down to zero. Source: Have one and live in Wisconsin. They are, IMO, a great deal."
frugalmalefashion,39g7hv,freeze00up,-4,Thu Jun 11 20:30:55 2015 UTC,Is this with goofy US American temperature units or the standard the rest of the world uses?   But in all seriousness that's quite interesting - I guess I tried it on in a store and it didn't feel very thick
frugalmalefashion,39g7hv,mmencius,5,Thu Jun 11 18:47:44 2015 UTC,-30 F is -34 C so i dont think it really makes a difference here

Mine (Chicago) had a bunch of the Levis Commuter stuff on sale. In the jackets they had black, and one other color...dark blue, I think. They had quite a few sizes, so they might be worth checking out, especially if you have the dividend still. I think they came back in March, so a lot of people may not have used them."

frugalmalefashion,39auae,Malne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"Hehe, I think it's more about proportion than actual size...so a 48 would still be moderate sized on your giant wrists. On mine, it would make my wrist look like Flava Flav"
frugalmalefashion,39auae,Komplete_Bullshit,7,Thu Jun 11 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is just me, but I'm totally missing why you bought one watch and just switched it to another band. It seems like it cost more than buying a similar watch with the band you want. Did you really want that face or something? Maybe I was just let down because I expected you to create a new watch out of parts from other watches."
frugalmalefashion,39auae,Quackattackaggie,8,Thu Jun 11 08:40:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that OP didn't make a dramatic alteration to this watch....calling a strap change a 'creation' seems a tad sensational.  But to your point: As someone who has several watches, virtually every watch I buy ends up on a different strap than the one it came with.  For starters, many stock straps are sub par quality, unless you're buying a high end watch. Also the potential combinations of watch and strap are endless, and finding one exactly like what you have in mind is often not possible.  In OP's case, I'd doubt very much he could find any watch with that particular NATO band, let alone one that matches the style and affordability of his particular watch."
frugalmalefashion,39auae,bensonator,6,Thu Jun 11 12:14:29 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't even think this looks good. The band doesn't match well with the rest of the watch at all.

frugalmalefashion,39dm67,d4nimal,4,Thu Jun 11 01:29:11 2015 UTC,The bamboo/sorona tees are my favorite tees right now. I'm really bummed I missed out on snagging a blue tortilla when I had the chance. /:
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,cup_of_chino,3,Thu Jun 11 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah - kinda sucks. It's making it harder to wear my regular cotton tees.  I haven't washed the bamboo/sorona yet, but I heard it doesn't shrink much."
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,cup_of_chino,2,Thu Jun 11 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"I do the typical wash cold + hang dry and haven't noticed any shrinkage yet. I'm starting to see a little pilling on my older shirt, but that's the extent of it. Still soft, still drapes well!"
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,xkenn,2,Thu Jun 11 03:34:02 2015 UTC,I got 2 of the bamboo shirts as well and have become a fan. Only downside I have is that the sleeves are SUPER long.
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,moneybagels,2,Thu Jun 11 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"I actually like the sleeves being pretty long.  It wears differently for sure but they don't extend past my wrist because the diameter of the sleeve is still pretty thin.  Totally personal preference, though."
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,IAMA_EMU,3,Thu Jun 11 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"I also got a bunch of stuff (in several orders since things kept being added to the sale): the mallard jacquard shirt, an overdye oxford shirt, a long sleeve tee, and 4 pairs of underwear. Also ordered two short sleeve tees and another pair of underwear last night. Everything is absolutely fantastic, the fabrics (especially the bamboo/sorona on the tees and underwear) are amazing, the fit is great, and all of these are an incredible steal at sale prices.   I'm probably gonna purchase a rewards membership."
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,SamoasAllYear,2,Thu Jun 11 13:30:00 2015 UTC,I'm jealous of the chambray. I ordered one and got shipping confirmation before being let know that they made an inventory mistake and it wasn't coming.
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,IAMA_EMU,2,Thu Jun 11 05:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Apparently stuff has been coming in/out of stock because of inventory issues.  So there's more stuff in the sale, but the flip side I'm sure is frustrating when you thought they had something."
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,SamoasAllYear,2,Thu Jun 11 12:13:36 2015 UTC,They still have a variety of chambray shirts in S/M. They just don't show up in the sales section for some reason.   Unless this is the inventory problem that you mentioned.
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,Reavor,2,Thu Jun 11 12:43:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I alluded to this in my lengthier post - I had to use a link someone else posted.  I'm pretty sure the chambrays are still sitting there because most people don't know how to find them - it's bananas.  Thanks for posting the link.
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,Foosa407,2,Thu Jun 11 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't realize this, thanks for the link. I think I would need an extra small though, considering OP says the small fit him well and I am a good 5 inches shorter than him."

frugalmalefashion,39dm67,compactgreen,2,Fri Jun 12 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"I bought the same chambray, tried it on when it came and liked it so much I kept it on and wore it to work the same morning. Around midday I noticed my hands were grey. The shirt was rubbing off.   Word of caution for those in a rush like me: wash it first, separately or there will be paint transfer between the shirt, your body and pants."
frugalmalefashion,39dm67,NotOverHisEX,2,Thu Jun 11 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Good info.  Haven't worn mine out yet.  I'll give it another wash to make sure, but I don't remember there being much transfer when I washed it in the machine on cold with a few other shirts the first time."

There are still chambrays available, and they should have a sizing chart on the page, if that helps.  I know some other guys here bought chambrays, so maybe they would be able to help you out further - particularly the guy who's washed his a couple times already.  Hope you get your answers."

Shipping and PayPal fees are included in the price. Offers and trades will be considered.  T Shirts   Green/White Bonobos Slim XS Pocket T $12 shipped   Only worn a few times, too small for me. Maybe three times tops. Lightweight, good for summer.  Blue/White Bonobos Slim XS Pocket T $12 shipped   Same as above, maybe worn three times tops. Good for summer.  Sky Blue J. Crew S Broken-In T $12 shipped   Standard fit. Worn about five times probably, I just didn't wear it enough.   Light Blue J. Crew Factory Slim S Contrast Pocket T $10 shipped   Worn about ten times, too small for me.   Light Green/Yellow J. Crew S Broken-In T $12 shipped   Really light green/yellow color. Almost a... pale neon, if that makes sense? Hard to capture the true color, but my camera did an okay job. Once again, worn about five times, I just didn't wear it enough.  Peach J. Crew S Broken-In T $12 shipped   Standard fit. I love this color, I have two of these shirts though, so I'm selling one.    Shorts   Pale Olive Bonobos Size 29 5 Inch Inseam Shorts $25 shipped   Really great shorts. These are their famous ""Washed Chino"" ones. I would love to keep these, but they're a little to small for me in the waste. They have the cool pocket detailing, as you can see in the photos. Worn once.  .    Pants   Turquoise Tommy Hilfiger 30/30 Slim Fit Pants $18 shipped   Listed as 30/32, but I had them hemmed to a 30 inch inseam. Cool color, I just don't wear them enough. The fit is definitely slim, but not close to skinny. I actually really like the fit of these, it's a good medium between skinny and classic fit. Worn about five times.  Light Blue H&M LOGG 30/32 Slim Fit Pants $10 shipped   Good pants for summer. A little skinnier than the Tommy Hilfiger ones, but not aggressively so. I just don't wear them often enough... maybe worn once or twice tops. The LOGG line is considered better quality than normal H&M.  Tan/Caramel J. Crew 29/30 Bowery Slim Pants $30 shipped   To small for me in the waist. Originally 29/32, had them hemmed to 29/30. Great color, especially for fall pants. Worn probably 15 times. The Bowery Slim fit isn't as aggressive as the 484 fit, but most people like it better than the Urban Slim fit.  Dark Gray Dockers 30/30 Alpha Slim Pants $15 shipped   I think they were labeled as ""Hurricane"" for the color, but I'm not sure. Worn a decent amount, I liked these pants. A little too slim for my taste though, so I've decided to sell them. One defect is a missing closure button -- I'm not sure how exactly to describe it. It's not the one at the top of the fly, it's the one off to the side that holds down the extra flap of material. Doesn't affect the pants at all that it's missing, the extra material just remains at your waist.  Orange Dockers 30/32 Alpha Slim Pants $12 shipped   I just don't wear these enough. I ordered ""Brick Red"" and got these orange ones instead, didn't realize they were the wrong ones until it was too late to return them. Worn about five times. Fun pants.    Jackets   Navy J. Crew XS Quilted Shirt Jacket $50 shipped   I like this jacket a lot, but it doesn't fit me quite the way I wanted it to. Didn't wear it much, maybe five times or so. It's a good fall/spring jacket. Not super warm, but thick enough to keep away some cold. Retailed for $168.  Blue/Gray J. Crew XS Ludlow Sportcoat in Mini-Houndstooth Cotton $60 shipped   Really good sportcoat for summer since it's 97% cotton. I like it a lot, but just don't wear it enough. Worn about ten times. Retailed for $188.    Button Downs   Rose Tile Plaid J. Crew Slim XS Buttondown $25 shipped   Material is called Indian cotton, which is lighter than an OCBD. Good shirt for summer. Worn a few times, but it's too small for me. Retailed for $75.  Light Blue Uniqlo Slim S OCBD $18 shipped each   Pretty much everyone knows this shirt. Good quality, slim fit. I have the same shirt in white that I'm selling for the same price, just let me know.    Sweatpants   Light Grey J. Crew XS Sweatpants $25 shipped   Great sweatpants, just too small for me. Worn a decent amount, but still in great shape. There's a loose thread on the pocket, but it doesn't affect anything.     Shoes   Clark's Desert Boots in Grey Suede size 7.5 $35 shipped   Too small for me. Good shoes, not too much wear on them.   Grey New Balance 574 size 9 $60 shipped   Awesome shoes, barely any wear. Just a tiny bit too small for me. Love these things though.  Black Allen Edmonds Park Avenues size 9.5 $125 shipped   High-quality shoes, they're just half a size too big for me. Wish I could keep these.   Chippewa Apaches size 8 $70 shipped   I really like these boots, but they're a little small on me. Worn about 15 times, so tons of life left.     Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer when I can. Again, all offers will be considered, and I will entertain trade offers as well. Thanks for looking!"

frugalmalefashion,39asgn,Discover_and_Become,11,Wed Jun 10 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"Most of this stuff isn't meant to be worn to professional workplaces. You could probably pull off the jeans and lots of the outerwear and still look professional, but ACNE isn't trying to create professional white collar workday clothes.  Also a lot of their stuff looks much better in person. ACNE has lots of weird fits and unique styling that looks, well, strange in a lot of the photos on the website. ACNE pieces (again, besides many of their pants/outerwear) tend to work better as a statement piece to be worn with otherwise more normal clothing. Plus the company has the models stand a bit awkwardly which contributes to the clothes looking strange. It's just part of their image as a company.  That all being said, if you don't like it, don't comment on it. It seems you have a limited view of what fashion is or means to many people. This sub has plenty of other deals for other clothing companies that are cheaper and have more normal clothes. If you are here for that type of clothing, stay in those threads or have a more open mind."

It can also be an art form, and it being wearable art is pretty cool to people  Some of us dress different because it's fun, not because we are like ""oh man lets be different so people notice we are different""  Why are you close minded?"

frugalmalefashion,39asgn,HipposLoveCereal,5,Thu Jun 11 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"looking stupid as fuck to make ""a statement.""   Most people who wear these clothes in real life do not look stupid wearing them, and are usually not trying to make a statement. They like the clothes, they wear them.   You can reject the norms all you want but if someone is that desparate to stand out for attention to fit in with others maybe therapy is in order to treat some self esteem issues.   You are judging people without ever having met them. You're not even trying to understand why someone would want to wear these clothes, and instead suggesting they have self esteem issues? Get over yourself.   I have a strong feeling that anyone wearing these clothes are hipster 1%ers who end up being cliche liberal arts majors (nothing wrong with liberal arts in itself).   Well you're wrong. Not much more to say about that.   No one who has had to work to get where they are is going to want to jeopardize their image to be ugly chic.   Random people aren't just going to suddenly pick up this style of fashion if it will negatively impact them. And many professionals wear clothes like this, just not in the workplace.   With a posting system open to comments, all is fair...both positive and negative. Don't like what I have to say? Shucks. Downvote.   Eh, I'd rather not. I like discussion. But the condition is that the people I'm discussing with should be 1) open-minded about the subject 2) respectful and 3) admit when they're not knowledgeable instead of making stuff up. Your first reply to the OP was disrespectful, and your other comments are clearly breaking the other rules I've set up for myself. Unless you change that, I won't be replying to any more of your posts after this one.   (ever heard of free speach?)   ell oh ell  I'm not protesting your right to comment. You can do what you want, but I will say you shouldn't want to participate in a community you apparently dislike and don't even try to understand.   I'll stick to Macy's or Nordstroms or something.   FYI, Nordstroms carries ACNE products.   If you have to look stupid to stand out and make a statement, then I feel sorry for you.   I feel sorry for you for thinking clothes like these are stupid. That's a remarkably constrained view of clothing and self-expression.   I might blend in with my Banana Republic tops and Express jeans, but when I get home from work from a high-rise office building and am lounging with my neighbors in my midrise condo downtown, I look around...   Oh god I'm so jealous you're so cool   and the only statements I see are not in the form of high-water chinos so I know I must be doing something right.   What a bland life."

frugalmalefashion,39cbu3,freakshoww,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:53:20 2015 UTC,"I recently purchased this shirt in burgundy from the Nordstrom Rack sale for $30. I would definitely recommend purchasing this shirt at this price point, the fabric is thick and comfortable.   My only gripe is that I physically cannot get my hands all the way through the sleeves without unbuttoning the cuffs first- although, once through, I can button the cuffs up again with no problem.   If anyone is interested in more detailed pictures of the fit and the fabric, I'd be happy to post some stuff."

frugalmalefashion,395v1y,nsummy,8,Wed Jun 10 00:33:04 2015 UTC,I just got 5 pairs for $50 with the sale posted the other day.  Hard to beat that price for shorts that Chubbies sells for $50 for 1 pair.  The only thing I don't like is the stigma of being 33 years old and wearing Hollister.  Luckily there is no real branding unless someone sees the tiny logo by the belt loops
frugalmalefashion,395v1y,AshtonEV,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:38:19 2015 UTC,Whats the sizing like?
frugalmalefashion,395v1y,James-Clarke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"I ordered large, which is a new size for me so hopefully they fit.  I used to wear a 36 waist pants, recently dropped to 34.  When I was at a 36 i had a few of these in XL and they fit well. Now they are too loose, though they do have belt loops. They go to mid thigh and don't have any sort of funky size issues you would expect from such a cheap article of clothing."
frugalmalefashion,395v1y,AshtonEV,2,Tue Jun 9 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"Don't they come in numerical waist sizes rather than S,M, etc"

frugalmalefashion,395v1y,skrenename4147,2,Tue Jun 9 17:01:58 2015 UTC,I don't think they actually want to get rid of them. I think they lower the price so people will want to buy more.  Just like cheap turkey during Thanksgiving or cheap pumpkin during Halloween.

frugalmalefashion,395d5a,wisspy,10,Tue Jun 9 14:34:22 2015 UTC,"I like J Crew's fit better.   Uniqlo has a weird fit in the torso/waist imo that leaves too much fabric. J Crew's is slimmer in that area. I only have experience with one OCBD from each store though, so it could just be QC."
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,Coffee_Transfusion,6,Tue Jun 9 18:30:58 2015 UTC,I wore one of uniqlos slim smalls and that fit good while the jcrew slim small is slightly smaller though also good just not as good to me as the uniqlo.  In other words it will be slimmer so if you are in between sizes (like me) that might be a reason to go up a size or down.
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,CMagex,4,Tue Jun 9 15:09:50 2015 UTC,Jcrew's fit a tad longer in the sleeves and body which I love

frugalmalefashion,395d5a,SelvedgeLeopard,0,Tue Jun 9 11:23:50 2015 UTC,"60% off some things, but still not their best deals. In other words, it's 60% off the original MSRP. But a few times throughout the year prices get lower than this when they have 40-50% off of an already reduced price.   Pretty close though for a few items."
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,NATTY_JESUS,14,Wed Jun 10 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"If anyone's wondering why J.Crew's having such a good deal, it's because they had a recent fiasco to do with their sweaters - Customers complained about peculiar new styles and a lack of the the trademark sweater, which made shareholders nervous. Therefore, big sales. They even had free donuts last Friday at all of their stores."
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,tworoadsdivergein21,11,Tue Jun 9 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting point, but a sweater fiasco in May/June? I can't imagine sweaters being anywhere near the top of the sales pile this time of the year. Or did you mean it happened in Q1?"
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,SelvedgeLeopard,4,Tue Jun 9 14:06:09 2015 UTC,"IMO, the sweater thing was just an excuse for poor performance from the company. You don't honestly believe those one or two items accounted for the losses JCREW suffered do you? It's what a lot of CEOs do when there is poor performance: they have to provide a reason, how they will overcome it or what they have done to address it, and provide some general positive forward looking statements.   This sale has nothing to do with that. Most items are at 30%. Only a few items are at 60, and it is what normally would have been liquidated anyways. The prices aren't even the best I have seen before."

frugalmalefashion,395d5a,BigBayesian,4,Tue Jun 9 11:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yup - they fit a little funny.  Fabric's not great (not bad at all, though, but Jcrew does better with thinner stuff - this one's thicker twill), cut's a little generous.  Not generous enough for my fat ass (well, stomach), but not bad."
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,xkenn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:36:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! Even the reg fit is slim-ish? I'm a stuck in between slim and reg for for jcrew. Slim is restricting on my chest and arms but good for my waist. And reg fit feels too lose around the waist. So if this is somewhere in the middle I may have to grab a few.
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,BigBayesian,2,Tue Jun 9 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"Not that slim-ish - the reviews say it's too baggy.  It's bigger in the shoulders, but not bigger enough in the body.  For me.    I'd say approach with caution - there's some chance it'll work for you, but a very real chance in won't.  Treat it like a $15 shirt and you won't be disappointed.  Treat it like a retail Jcrew shirt that you got at a good price, and you may be dissatisfied."
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,xkenn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:33:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'll buy it since I can go either way with slim and reg fit and the looser shoulder may mean more room for my chest. Also if I leave it untucked the looser waist may not bother me as much.
frugalmalefashion,395d5a,geoman2k,2,Tue Jun 9 13:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have one and I'm not a huge fan. Feels boxy in the fit and the fabric isn't great quality. Not as nice as other stuff I've gotten from JCrew, much more like JCrew Factory stuff."

I think the fabric is fine, though it is thicker, which I guess makes sense considering its called a field shirt.  I have the slim fit and while I wouldn't consider it boxy, its definitely not that slim.  Tucked in though I think it looks good.  You wouldn't be able to wear it untucked.

frugalmalefashion,395d5a,fishdontreddit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:10:57 2015 UTC,So I assume you purchased the small? Can you comment on the waist size? I'm also deciding between XS and S (size 30 waist).

frugalmalefashion,396hym,coronaas,3,Tue Jun 9 19:07:43 2015 UTC,I bought the Medium Grey. I really like the colour but I wish i bought the large. after my work laptop and a small lunch there isnt much room for anything else.
frugalmalefashion,396hym,SHOUTING,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:16:03 2015 UTC,would it be to much to ask that you post a picture of it filled up? Because I got a medium also because i feel that a large would make me look so tiny since im only 5'5.

I don't feel that it is too big for me, but if I was any smaller I might. It sits up pretty high which is good for your back, but bad if you are small trying to pass with a big bag. Unfortunately,  with the large you sacrifice the outer front pocket and thermos pocket on the inside, but the side pockets are more use able and the bottom of the pack is leather instead of fabric. Both great, although they are pretty different."

They're attached like a belt would be, which means that it's a pain to adjust them. I also rarely wear the backpack with both straps across my shoulders. The backside of the backpack doesn't contour well with your actual back, and it isn't all that comfortable for long periods of time. So if you don't have a problem with this or you prefer to wear it across only one shoulder, then this issue really doesn't matter."

I then purchased a large in in ""uncle blue"".  Both colours are great.  I bought the large, as the medium did not have the capacity for what I needed to carry on a daily basis (laptop, notebook, textbook(s), gym clothes and running shoes). The large is not super large, like some type of cross-Europe backpacker's bag.  In term of wear and tear I've had no issues thus far, the leather on the bottom of the large is a nice touch."

frugalmalefashion,3965kq,bagels_are_delicious,2,Tue Jun 9 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"small if you want to only wear a t shirt underneath, medium if you wanna wear longs sleeves under  I'm 5'8"" 156lb and I wear the XS. Don't worry about the chest being tight, I'm a 40"" chest. I was able to try on a small once and it didn't really look too much different, just a little more space all around. If I could redo, I would go with the small because I can't pull the sleeves past my forearm with the XS (sleeves a little tight in general, but I liked how the body was slimmer). So I would recommend the medium for you.  Edit: also don't worry about shrinkage, It'll stretch back out"
frugalmalefashion,3965kq,hereforemore,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:14:29 2015 UTC,Same boat as you kinda. I have a weird fit where I wear slim/reg smalls in Jcrew and Uniqlo button downs and undershirts. But for polos and sweaters I generally get a Medium. My arms and chest tend to be a lil restricted on the small buttondowns but only noticeable when I flex. I am 5'8 and 155lbs. That being said I most likely will go for medium as I dont want them tight or restricted.

Also, /u/aaronvincero3: let's just start calling ""prefunding"" for what it is: it's a loan. You want customers to take a chance on an unseen product from an unproven brand with big promises of quality and little to no track record, and you then want people to loan you money for a period of time.   For members of the sub who are looking for an affordable watch, you can find pieces from Orient (a VERY well-proven brand with remarkable quality for the price point) in this general price range without the delay, the uncertainty, or any questions about the warranty you'd be getting. I can speak quite highly of Orient watches in terms of value for money."

frugalmalefashion,39c5mc,Rhett_Rick,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:27:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for looping me in.  We have successfully launched 4 new collections this spring (for both watches and leather bags). Not to mention our brand was launched last year via Kickstarter. As with any new brands there is always bound to be concern about the quality of the products, so feel free to hop over to our Style Forum affiliate thread for reviews on some of our latest collections.  For us we use crowdfunding as a tool to more closely line up supply and demand and I think it's a great tool for the fashion industry in general. For us, it allows us to develop products along side our members and not strictly for our members.  By getting feedback on new designs all the way through the process we can focus our efforts on only producing products members want while not wasting capital on designs they don't. If a product doesn't get funded it doesn't get made, simple as that. But, again we try to curb this by getting member feedback throughout the process.  The bottom line we like interacting with our customers and listening to what they have to say. If you have any questions about our biz, products or anything you would like to see in the future I would love to hear them!"

frugalmalefashion,396cob,ajenius620,3,Tue Jun 9 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Up to 80%+ off  Really good shit here guys.  (I stepped out of work for a while to hit up SoHo within the first two hours of the sale, so there was a pretty abundant selection there)  I pretty much only went through shirts, and not really anything else.  Didn't really go through Michael Bastian because it was still out of my price range.   Michael Bastian - a lot of shirting for $100-$200 (from a ~$400-500 price tag), and some outerwear, shoes, accessories (didn't look at prices) Craft Atlantic - some S/S '15 shirts for $65, old stock for $40-$50, and good amount for $25 (I got two).  There were also some jackets and I think some pants and accessories. Burkman Brothers - didn't really see much, there were shirts, pants, and shorts for a good discount Ernest Alexander - this was what I thought was really good.  Some shirts were ~$70 i think, but there were boxes for $39 shirts (mostly XS, S, a few M), $35 ties, $12-15 pocket squares, a $5 box of random, and a $29 box of random stuff (I got a lightweight chambray jacket from here).  TONS of waxed bags, portfolios, and some leather goods (folios, wallet (I got one for $39), and I think a bag or two).  Really good quality waxed bags from past seasons (you can compare to what's similar on the website right now).  Some messengers were $175-$225, some duffles for around $300ish or less. Eyewear - There was an eyewear brand in the middle that looked pretty cool, but I wasn't in the market for any.   And if you're not from NYC, don't be afraid to ask someone to proxy!  This has been one of the best sample sales I've seen recently!"

Their pants, shirts, and everything else were so inexpensive I had to try buying something. I ordered two pairs of pants, the cotton twill jeans, and the ""riversiders.""   Here are pics of the two pairs I bought. There are comments and descriptions in there too. You can see that the fit on the riversiders is pretty weird, but these ""jeans"" are great. The riversiders are great quality too, but they'd have to be tailored to be real nice looking.  I'll definitely keep an eye on their stuff. These clothes look like they are made to work, a lot of them seem to be made domestically, and they're inexpensive."

I have it in the navy and it's great for casual wear.  Edit: Also, keep an eye out for the Neumok in green or red; they may not be available now, but if they are, they might be really cheap. They were at $97 last sale. And BB seconds were all at $159."

I wanted to get them, but I ended up with the Green Rush Street instead.  Those fit more like the Strand since the last is the same, and there is leather lining, but with a Dainite sole (which I like a lot better than a single leather sole).  I got it in the same sale, but it was ~$120 for those."

The quality felt fine (I even liked the soft, thin leather - very comfortable), but I just didn't like the look of them. There's a big contrast between the leather of the wingtip ""cap"" and the top of the shoe which gives them a clown shoe or bowling shoe look. It was much more apparent than it was in the photos and I didn't like it. I ended up returning them and getting a pair of McTavishes instead, which are similar but much nicer looking.  Just my opinion though."

frugalmalefashion,393kib,diversification,2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:59 2015 UTC,I agree. The good ones were made in India and the new ones are made in Nicaragua. Lots of reviews are disappointed with the change too. http://www.target.com/p/men-s-crew-neck-t-shirt-mossimo-supply-co/-/A-13771083
frugalmalefashion,393kib,cobaltorange,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:42:10 2015 UTC,When did they make this change? How is the quality now?
frugalmalefashion,393kib,rogrogrickroll,4,Tue Jun 9 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"The collar is raised now, and tends to sit up more. The tail is shorter, and the fit is significantly less tapered. The material tends to stretch out within an hour or two now, which it didn't do before.  I have a chest-to-waist drop of thirteen inches, so I loved the taper of the old shirts. Now it's too tight in the chest and too loose in the waist. Real shame."
frugalmalefashion,393kib,BrooklynNets,3,Tue Jun 9 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"Ennnnhh...I don't think all of them are changed. Every one I've tried in stores recently still fits mostly the same (varying QC problems means the shoulder can be slightly off on some, so I'll usually try several of the same color).   There are certain colors that have a slightly different feel (and different fabric content; 55% cotton; 45% poly instead of the usual 60/40), but even their fit is the same. I won't recommend those ones because I had two in the ""peat moss"" color that after a wash or two lost their color and deteriorated or something."
frugalmalefashion,393kib,ampersammich,2,Tue Jun 9 06:34:44 2015 UTC,Check the country of production. They may still be stocking the old style for certain colours where you live.

The construction and leather quality are in my opinion going to be the best quality for the price point that you will find unless you go up to about $200 or more. My boots have been through a lot as they are my go-to beater pair and while I haven't put a lot of miles on them, they've held up great over the past 2 years that I've had them.  The fit is slimmer than many other work-style boots and quite modern. I've sized them in a 9.5D which is what I normally wear so I'd consider these true to size.  All in all, I'd say the service boots are a pretty good deal so I highly recommend them."

They looked even better after I put some Obenauf's leather oil on them, too. But...recently they started to squeak when I walk. Just a little bit, like a small creak, but I definitely notice it with every step. Any ideas how to get this to go away, or is it a permanent defect with the shoe??"

The process was brought to the United States and improved by inventor Seth Boyden of Newark, New Jersey in 1818, with commercial manufacture beginning September 20, 1819. Boyden's process, which he never patented,  used a linseed oil–based lacquer coating. Modern patent leather usually has a plastic coating.

frugalmalefashion,38zsjb,diversification,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:16:21 2015 UTC,Anyone have experience with the JCP return policy if you go well past the return period? Like an idiot I bought two pairs in different sizes about 3 months or so ago and haven't even opened the box. Obviously one of them won't fit and I was planning to return. Think they'll make an exception or am I looking at going to route of the buy/sell thread?
frugalmalefashion,38zsjb,dowhatisaynotwhatido,2,Mon Jun 8 13:04:42 2015 UTC,JCP don't have a limit on their return period - see here and here.

frugalmalefashion,390vok,marfin20,2,Mon Jun 8 12:59:27 2015 UTC,Anyone comment on the fit?  I see the measurements but I dno how accurate etc.  also they don't vanity size? So their size 32 is a true 32 inch waistband?
frugalmalefashion,390vok,arcangeltx,3,Mon Jun 8 13:58:25 2015 UTC,use the search bar. according to ppl feedback its vanity so size 32 measures 34
frugalmalefashion,390vok,Davin900,3,Mon Jun 8 14:00:16 2015 UTC,They do vanity sizing. I find they fit similar to Banana or J Crew in the waist... so standard vanity sizing.
frugalmalefashion,390vok,modagmy,2,Mon Jun 8 14:16:20 2015 UTC,If you typically wear a size 32 with other brands then I'd recommend going with a size 32 with us.

Got my blue Oxford Dobby pants last Friday and I really love how they look/fit.  This may be an odd question for you, but my biggest issue is trying to figure out what shirts go with it. Any quick suggestions for what type of shirt (style/color) you really like with these pants? I'm having some trouble imagining outfits with these pants."
frugalmalefashion,390gk3,jc9289,5,Mon Jun 8 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"As far as shoes, I would go with gray boat shoes, brown wingtip brogues or derby shoes, or white bucks.   As far as tops depends of how formal/casual you want to look. Try rocking a white crewneck with a dress shirt or denim jacket. Or a white polo(or a v neck) with a navy blazer(or a cardigan). A navy blue vneck with or without a white jacket might look good. You can also try a red blazer with a blue or white shirt if you want to look a bit more formal.  Here are some looks to get you started:  http://cdn3.lookastic.com/looks/chinos-and-boat-shoes-and-henley-shirt-and-dress-shirt-and-belt-large-1555.jpg  http://cdn2.lookastic.com/looks/aquamarine-crew-neck-sweater-navy-polo-light-blue-chinos-blue-canvas-espadrilles-navy-woven-canvas-belt-brown-sunglasses-large-11583.jpg  http://cdn3.lookastic.com/looks/oxford-shoes-socks-chinos-belt-polo-cable-sweater-large-9045.jpg  http://cdn2.lookastic.com/looks/pocket-square-and-longsleeve-shirt-and-blazer-and-chinos-and-tie-large-563.jpg  I would google, light blue pants outfit and see what kind of outfits come up.

frugalmalefashion,390gk3,ConLostProfound,3,Mon Jun 8 12:37:37 2015 UTC,I think /u/Citizen_V has it. These are the same fabrics from the pre-order and there isn't even a link to this page on their site.

I have thick thighs though, so I'm not sure if that changes it a ton. I didn't fit the normal 32's, but if you're a slim guy through the thigh and leg, you might be able to fit the Slim Alpha Khakis in 31.

So if that's any indication, these are probably heavy as hell, but durable, warm and have good grip where it's needed (though again that'd obviously be sole-dependent, which is where they seem to differ).  I miss my Sundowners.  Well, to be more clear, I miss them up until the point the shanks in each, an irreparable fix, broke down - something that seemed to be common when they began outsourcing their production to China.  Anyway, these look terrific and bring back fond memories.  Too bad there's nothing in my size.    Edit: For anyone curious about the Sundowners, I found this post with the OP, elsewhere in the thread, complaining almost precisely about the same issues I had with mine (along with some others he didn't mention).

This was like 18-24 months after getting my Vasques; I wrote them a letter and they noted warranty was for a year and pointed me to repair places in my area.  I never took them anywhere and relegated them to camping-only.  Much more recently, I decided to look into fixing them again; wrote the guy on the west coast who does Vasque repairs (I forget his name) and he essentially told me that the issue was irreparable."

frugalmalefashion,38seeb,jkelly17,2,Sat Jun 6 17:48:28 2015 UTC,Mainly because you get to try the frames and ensure they fit before you buy
frugalmalefashion,38seeb,michaelhe,0,Sun Jun 7 10:12:15 2015 UTC,Or do they have frames you don't like and a quality of lens that is sufficient for around $100 total?  Most of these online optical shops that cost around a bill use the same cheap plastic lenses. Why is Warby any worse than the op shop?
frugalmalefashion,38seeb,2capp,4,Sun Jun 7 19:21:57 2015 UTC,Because at Warby you pay twice the price that the glasses are worth so they can donate a pair to charity. No better than a BOGO scam.
frugalmalefashion,38seeb,cexshun,2,Sun Jun 7 21:01:46 2015 UTC,And you think paying $300 for Kenneth Cole frames at your local optical shop is a better deal? LOL

I have worn glasses most of my life. I've purchased glasses from Walmart, America's Best, many traditional optometrists, and (most recently) Zenni. My Zenni glasses are on par with the (admittedly mid-range) frames and lenses I've previously purchased in the past. I own 3 pairs of glasses from them. My wayfarer shades have a tiny fleck of tint missing from when I dropped them on day 2 or 3 (for which I can't really fault the manufacturers). Otherwise, they are great.

frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,GetMentalGetWeird,22,Fri Jun 5 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"Congrats on having your own website!  Just received the 2-piece CXL watch band not long ago, an order I placed on Esty when you had your sale last time. The band is beautiful and I am very happy with the purchase.  Edit 3: Seller has explained the concern I have in multiple replies, I will still leave this conversation up for others who are curious. Bottom line is, these are great quality straps especially at this price range. Lowest prices I have seen, therefore, justified another purchase! =) If you are looking for simple, durable straps, look no further!  One small complain though, I remember browsing through your comments about your pricing. I had the same concern as another redditor because after missing out on your 30% sale (with a code) a couple months back I have been paying close attention to your site in anticipation for another sale. The last time you posted a sale up to 40%, prices as marked, I saw no price changes. Then I read in your comment that these 2-piece should be priced around $35-40, so the $24 that I paid for the strap is on sale. With that in mind, I purchased the strap.  Now with the opening of your site, you have these same straps marked for $25 regular (and not the $35- $40 regular that you have mentioned) and $15 on sale. With $2 shipping it comes out to be $17. $24 - $17 = $7. It is a mere $7 dollar difference, but I feel like there was some lack of transparency in regards to the pricing. If you can offer an explanation, it would be fantastic, if not I am not too bummed out, its only $7. Thanks.  Edit: a word"
frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,GetMentalGetWeird,30,Fri Jun 5 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"I'm saving a huge amount of money by becoming autonomous, that was part of my motivation to move away from etsy!    I certainly don't feel like I've ever been dishonest, I hope that every customer has gotten exactly what they expected for the price they paid.  And I'm always trying to find good ways to bring that amount down...different packaging, trying out alternate label providers, investing in equipment that makes repetitive tasks quicker...that kind of thing.    Every time I save myself an hour, (lets say making 5 straps) I shave $30 off my costs, so about $6 per strap.  I mean, I could keep that difference but I'm not trying to be Walmart.  So for instance the recent addition of a leather splitter to my shop is allowing me to make 2-piece straps in a much shorter time frame and much more uniformly.  If you want to discuss more so we can find a good resolution for you, hit me up on etsy!  I've never heard of a complaint about my prices going down before!"
frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,wow445,3,Fri Jun 5 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I really do appreciate that. I really do respect the fact that you are trying to pass down savings to your customers instead of pocketing it. I suppose that I was just surprised that within 20 days, you were able to shave off over 30% of your total cost (granted probably a large part due to not having to go through the middleman). I am sorry I used the word dishonesty, I think I was just surprised discrepancy in pricing over such a short period of time. With the business model of so many stores now-a-days using the word ""sale"" in the most lax manners, it makes me very sensitive to price adjustments (especially those made within return/price-adjustment period, sorry, I am spoiled by amazon).  Prices going down in fine by me, I was on the fence (and ultimately jumped the gun) with the strap at $24 and I am having a hard time convincing myself not to buy another one at $17 (to accompany the Rodina.)  Like I have said, the straps and the craftsmanship is fantastic, I don't really need a resolution other than an explanation to the gap in price difference, which you have provided, thanks."
frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,lomaxbernie,9,Fri Jun 5 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"If it helps, this is the lowest my prices are probably every going to be until at least September!    As a J.

So I totally get where you're coming from!"
frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,exitoff,7,Fri Jun 5 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"I noticed this too and despite the lack of transparency (actually I think they've addressed this in previous threads) I still think it's justified and hold no hard feelings for paying more (I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and am looking to buy another actually). I bought a one piece brown chromexcel strap back in Jan ""on sale"" for $21.50 including shipping. That strap now is $10 + $2 shipping. The way I see it though is I got mine back when he was most likely starting out and getting a feel for what his profit margins were. As he became more efficient and most likely quicker at producing the same items he was able to pass along those savings. So, I genuinely believe they were not being dishonest and have actually begun to pass along savings to customers which I respect."
frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,CoogiDownToThaSocks,10,Fri Jun 5 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, you totally get it.  Finding my footing has been very challenging, and leather costs are all over the place this year.  Plus etsy was eating about $300 for every $1000 I made, no exaggeration.    I basically price products as low as I possibly can at a given time, but I'm learning now that maybe folks would rather they stay totally consistent!"
frugalmalefashion,38p4u7,blackgravios,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"No problem. I actually posted some pics of the strap in question in one of your previous threads when people we're asking about thickness. I've appreciated seeing your business evolve and congrats on the website :)   And I Think you're getting there in terms of consistency. I can't imagine you'd be able to reduce the price much more and still make a profit. But if you do plan on your prices fluctuating based on market value of leather at any given moment I would certainly have some kind of disclaimer explaining the reasoning.   And by the way, if you're so inclined, it'd be awesome if I could get a PM and maybe a reservation for the first 20mm one piece natural chromexcel strap you get back in stock :) I know you said elsewhere it could be a while but it's exactly what I'm looking for!"

The leather is thicker than the Chromexcel I use so empty it's at 1/2 inch.  And it is missing an element of rigidity that a wallet needs.  You can smash it into a ball it's so soft.  It's ideal for straps but the bifold feels like it was made out of thick fabric or something.

frugalmalefashion,38q7u7,deltawolf88,2,Sun Jun 7 16:57:28 2015 UTC,For unjustly and unnecessarily raising your prices. Just because your minimum wage tenant earns a little bit more now doesn't mean you should screw him out of that small gain.

frugalmalefashion,38q7u7,Manavj36,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  It's a tough time honestly to buy a heavy winter coat as most stores cleared their inventory a while back.  I would try online at places rather than brick and mortar at the moment like Campsaver etc as they might still have something good in your size on clearance.  Other places to look would be the clearance online stores like Barneyswarehouse (though final sale).  Uniqlo always has some down stuff in stock, though it's the lighter ultralight down right now.  I know century 21, nordstrom rack in particular aren't really carrying heavy winter clothes at the moment."

I think the watch looks great in your photos, but my experience was not the same.

I messaged the seller on Amazon for a refund and they actually wound up refunding the money and letting me keep the watch, so I can't complain about the seller at all. The watch feels pretty solid otherwise, but the chrono hands don't always line back up properly. Just figured I'd give my review."

A few months after I got it I had to take it to a watchmaker because the dial moved a tad when I set the time (they build the watches before they send them out.) It was a $5 repair and I have had no problems since.   The TC is actually 40mm not 42.

frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,jsurrette,13,Fri Jun 5 00:41:30 2015 UTC,Eh people's definition of frugality varies. Last time I did this the budget was $250 and it concentrated on the $150 sweet spot. A lot of people said that anything over $100 (or even $50 in some cases) was too much for a watch. So I tried to find other options that are in the sub $100 price-range (that aren't Weekenders.)   Despite the lie on the dial the TSS is a really solid watch for the price.

frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,chronoserge456,6,Fri Jun 5 10:55:51 2015 UTC,Fantastic post. These watches are right in my (cheap) price range and look pretty nice too.

frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,play_it_safe,2,Fri Jun 5 01:21:37 2015 UTC,It's a damn solid choice for a first watch. It is a sports watch and is a bit bigger than most so I would be hesitant to wear it to any kind of dress or formal function. Before for anything that is a bit less formal you should be good to go. Get a spring bar tool and some 22mm NATO straps and mix and match until your heart is content.
frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,kingzley00,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:23:27 2015 UTC,what's the spring bar tool? I selected a couple of straps :)
frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,nullstring,2,Fri Jun 5 03:03:06 2015 UTC,It's what you use to pop off a non-NATO strap. They are like $5 on Amazon.

frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,safebrowseatwork,3,Fri Jun 5 02:16:13 2015 UTC,Thanks man that's much appreciated. It's a pretty flexible watch. By a few NATO straps and a brown leather one and you are set. I would not wear it at a formal but otherwise you are good.

frugalmalefashion,38ld2n,Soysauce801,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:39:59 2015 UTC,I've had my eye on that one in particular for a while. It's an homage to the Rolex Sub Ref. 5513 and Tudor Sub Ref. 7928 which are both from the late 70s. I would personally get the Miyota movement if you want to have the watch easily serviced. Miyota is owned by Citizen so parts are abundant.

frugalmalefashion,38p2mq,shirtpantloafer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:15:17 2015 UTC,Id say the quality for kenneth cole reaction is similar to jcrew factory.  Most of their designs are pretty bad. They always have many sales whenever I visit my local kenneth cole reaction. The price above for shirts seems to be a decent deal. I probably can visit their stores at any time of the year and pick up a shirt that costs about 20.  On the other hand Kenneth cole New York and Collection is supposedly to be higher quality but I have no experience with those.

frugalmalefashion,38oftm,bombina,5,Sat Jun 6 00:07:42 2015 UTC,45mm is not too big for most people. That's a mid sized watch and common for a diver's watch. You want gaudy and goofy? Look at the larger G-shocks. Deep Blue is a proper diver's watch at an affordable price and if you're dissapointed because it's not another Timex weekender then you're sadly misinformed.
frugalmalefashion,38oftm,Dochorahan,-2,Sat Jun 6 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, their smallest size offering is 45 mm, but the lug to lug width is 51 mm. Next to say a watch of that width fits the wrist of a majority of people is absolutely false. Finally to throw a blanket statement on me about a Timex Weekender (where did that come from?) with no basis is so childish and asinine -- frankly doesn't even deserve a reply."
frugalmalefashion,38n57s,DasDo0kie,6,Fri Jun 5 08:08:37 2015 UTC,"I had this watch (no date) and loved it dearly. I think the design is unbeatable for a smart casual watch. Only thing is it just stopped working one day and that was the end of it. No idea why or how, but it dead.   I think that it may be worth it to get another, more reliable watch. As approximately 100+ per year to wear a watch like this isn't worth it to me.   Grabbed the Orient bambino with the white dial to replace it."

Also a great looking watch at this price point, the domed crystal is sexy looking.  From what I can gather, the quality of these things are fairly reliable, however, I have never owned one so I cannot tell you from personal experience. Maybe you were one of the few unlucky ones to have received a defective unit.  Either way, they are both great looking watches, but I just happen to dig the ""Nomos"" look too much to pass on this one. One day I will save up to buy the Nomos!"

frugalmalefashion,38n57s,N4ggerman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for a year and it's still going strong and it's also very accurate. I think it's a gamble with these watches because their source of production is pretty unknown and not being a well established company there are some batch to batch differences (different dial shades, more/less blue hands, blue screws etc) that probably carryover to quality too. That being said, I think 95% of the time you're going to get a watch that you won't have issues with."
frugalmalefashion,38n57s,strife25,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's completely dead?   I forgot that the watch I currently have is an automatic, so the gears will completely stop if you don't wear it for a while (automatic uses you're wrist's motion to power the watch). So it may be that the watch just needed to be shaken for a couple of seconds to get it going again."

Hard to find sapphire crystal at this price point. Last but not least, this is a homage/copy (depending on your view) of the Nomos Tangente, a watch with a popular minimalist view."

frugalmalefashion,38n57s,Citizen_V,3,Fri Jun 5 15:57:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I agree with you too. It is a ""copy"" of Nomos, but it is not a ""fake"" as it doesn't try to put Nomos name on it, instead it puts the name of its own mushroom company.

I've seen the Sebago ones in a consignment store and I considered getting them. The Sebago are darker and the Joseph Abboud ones don't have a shoelace that wraps around the ankle like other boat shoes (there's one that goes around, but you can't do anything with it, then there's a disconnected one that you actually tie).   I do enjoy the texture of the Joseph Abboud ones a lot though. No real complaints, I just wish I had more to provide in terms of how durable they are."

Want to see how the color of these turn out cause I'm thinking of returning the JA's (a little too dark brown for my tastes)
frugalmalefashion,38jex9,hax_wut,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"I got an email confirmation of my order, but I had to manually check order status to see it shipped. It had a tracking number so I knew when to expect it (I shipped it to a local store). I also received an email when it arrived ""your order is ready for pickup "". Honestly whenever the deal was (Wednesday? Tuesday?) I felt like it went by so fast.   As for the quality, I'm not the best judge of leather so I'm not sure. Definitely will soften over time. It's a little too dark brown for me (like a chocolate) which is why I ordered the Sebago too. The Joseph abboud are my first pair of boat shoes ever. Seems like it's pretty decent but like I said 0 experience before.   I normally am a 12-13 (flat feet so sometimes gotta get larger size for width) but am a 11.5 in CDBs so I got an 11.5. The length is great but the shoe kind of deforms in the middle to accomodate my wide foot. It will be interesting to see how it lasts over time. Maybe I should have stayed true to size."
frugalmalefashion,38jex9,SaintsDynasty,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"Just want to chime in about the comfort of these, the arch support is non-existent (big surprise in a boat shoe, I know), and they aren't very comfortable.  They are better quality than sperry in my opinion, but they are far less comfortable. The topsider has a padded sole in the heel.  Basically a comfort/quality argument between sperry and sebago."
frugalmalefashion,38jex9,Captain_of_Reddit,3,Sat Jun 6 00:39:34 2015 UTC,Would putting an insole help? Do people even do that? Put in insole into boat shoes?

frugalmalefashion,38jex9,sosern,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:13:40 2015 UTC,"Update: Ordered on the 4th, received my two pairs on the 9th. Looks like there are still size 7 and 9 available on the site.  Some useful information for people in the future:  Sizing: As some forums have mentioned, they run bigger than Sperry's. I'm a 9.5 for most sneakers (Nike), dress shoes, and Sperry's. I ordered the 9 and 9.5 Sebago Docksides, and the 9 was a better fit. Snug, but with still some breathing room. The 9.5 fit, but I would need thick athletic socks to be comfortable walking all day in them. Will probably give them to a friend or sell them online.  Comfort: Other reviews have mentioned that Sebagos need more time to break in due to the leather thickness, and I can definitely see that. Right now, there are certain areas that don't have enough give. For example, the inside ankle and the tongue. I'm going to be wearing no-show socks with them until they're more broken in. Sperry Top Siders win in terms of out-of-the-box comfort.  Color: These navy shoes are like really dark. They look black in fluorescent lighting but look blueish in direct sunlight. Very versatile, as my other boat shoes are brown, which don't really go with every outfit.  Quality: Comfort aside, they look and feel like a quality product. No frayed threads, and the shoelaces seem solid. I'm by no means an expert on leather quality, so take that with a grain of salt. The thick leather also makes them a bit warm to wear, so maybe it makes sense not to go sock-less anyway.  Definitely worth $40. Probably worth twice as much, but I don't think I'd pay full price for a pair."

However, if it seems necessary, I might do it.   bonus question - how do i pick pants that will be conducive to tailoring?"

Just simply saying it isn't 50% lower than the competition. It's merely 10% at best. The watch is $200 for m me since I live in NY.

frugalmalefashion,38eph3,westcoastdrumz,2,Thu Jun 4 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"I bought pants. The size 32 on the chart said they would fit a 33-34"" waist, if measured with some slack. I bought those, and the pants measured 15.75 across. So the size 32, which should fit 33-34, was in reality only 31.5"" around... So yeah it was WAY too small. The 34 i exchanged for on the other hand measured 36"" around. I gave up and just demanded my money back, absolutely wasn't taking store credit for their messed up sizing mistakes.  That and the lack of any real details (knee opening, cuff opening, etc) just make buying from them a huge hassle"
frugalmalefashion,38eph3,Prince_Uncharming,4,Thu Jun 4 18:53:49 2015 UTC,I recently bought a pair of the Selvedge 32x32 overruns.  They fit exactly like my jcrew 770 Japanese Selvedge.  The weight of the denims are very comparable.  For $55 shipped I wish I had bought two pair!

frugalmalefashion,38dbds,elchismoso,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"These are gorgeous.  Any idea how they fit compared to other brands/shoes? I wear 10D in Red Wings Beckmans, for reference. I don't know what other shoes I can compare with haha."
frugalmalefashion,38dbds,Softcorps_dn,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:49:16 2015 UTC,I would say they fit true to size. I wear a 9.5 in dress shoes and a 10 in sneakers and these were pretty much a half size too big for me. Pretty disappointed since I got such a good deal on them but since they're loafers I can't do much to make them fit any better.

frugalmalefashion,38doe8,_RacecaRacecaR_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:49:43 2015 UTC,Just buy STF's and have them tapered.  That's what everyone did before Levi's began making other jeans.

frugalmalefashion,38doe8,SweetDaddyPatty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"tried on store but didn't have enough $, but this seems like the best opportunity! Loved the fit personally, as I have slightly large thighs. Fit is roomy but not super baggy by any means above knee, and it tapers pretty aggressively (suited my taste) to I'd prob say a leg opening of anywhere b/w 13-14. Rise is def not super high as shown in pictures, its more mid rise I'd say. It's honestly refreshing trying on a higher rise pair of pants for once and I really liked it, very comfortable.  I did take some pictures if anyone is interested on the fit!"

frugalmalefashion,38doe8,thepornidentity,2,Thu Jun 4 03:57:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I started doing squats and now even slim fit pants are too tight. 501 stfs are dope but they definitely could use taper.  I would get a pair if CTs if they still have 30x34 in stock.

It took them until February to send me my order.  The shirts ended up being too small, so I sent them back for an exchange.  After waiting months for my new shirts, I called and they told me it would likely be another 3-4 months before I would receive my shirts.  I asked them to refund and cancel.  The customer service was great, but don't expect fast turn around.  My understanding is they are a smaller company and have issues handling volume."

They are also not as shiny.   They are not total crap. I have worn them out and to work. It's just that they are not silk. If you expect a good tie, you will be disappointed.  I wouldn't buy them."

frugalmalefashion,38c9ak,Mexicorn,2,Wed Jun 3 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"As of late last year, CG ties are a step up from Tie bar quality, but still not quite as good as very good department store quality. With both Tie Bar and CG, I have to use a Pratt knot to get a good dimple and proper shape. A four in hand won't do it.  On the whole, I'm slightly pleased with CG's ties for the money, and slightly displeased with The Tie Bar. Both of them lose to JCP Stafford ties on clearance, however. All three of those are in a similar $15-19 price range, and clearance priced Staffords are the better alternative of the three. A Stafford will tie a decent knot with almost any method."
frugalmalefashion,38c9ak,thepornidentity,2,Wed Jun 3 16:37:28 2015 UTC,"I've only had one tie from the tie bar, but these are better imo.  tiebar has way more variety to choose from though.  With free shipping and free returns, you can't go wrong with combatgent."
frugalmalefashion,38c9ak,Prince_Uncharming,2,Wed Jun 3 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"FYI, if you choose a tie that's $14 and one that's $16 plus the TWITTER coupon code, the higher price is free so you end up paying just $14..."

After speaking with their customer service, they fixed my double order and said that they would ship my ties that day. I received my ties yesterday and I would say that the ties met my expectations. One tie had a small manufacturing defect but I'm not sending it back. For 8 dollars a tie, I think I got a good deal. The fabrics used were ok, the style is modern.   Would I shop with them again? probably. Like others have mentioned, their customer service is definitely very straightforward and understanding. The only thing that would prevent me from shopping there is their website shopping experience. If they fix their website, expand their tie selection, and keep having deals I would shop there again."

frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,Phobos1393,13,Wed Jun 3 07:04:49 2015 UTC,They look nice but that branding is pretty off putting.
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,spistillo,5,Wed Jun 3 12:41:40 2015 UTC,You're just a $2 seam ripper away from no branding.
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,cfoust,3,Wed Jun 3 13:44:44 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Same thing with their denim. I know they are pretty aware of their customers preferences and keep tabs on this sub as well as MFA so it wouldn't surprise me if they lose the excessive branding down the road if they feel people aren't real into it. Seems like a great company.
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,clive_bigsby,8,Wed Jun 3 14:27:01 2015 UTC,ears are open - we are listening. It is the wide label on back pocket you are not happy with? or front pocket square?
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,pointerbrand,10,Wed Jun 3 17:13:44 2015 UTC,The back pocket is definitely more off-putting.
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,Pupusaman,3,Wed Jun 3 17:40:54 2015 UTC,Was thinking this same thing when I looked at them.
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,achosid,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:12:42 2015 UTC,I personally dig the front pocket label and wouldn't mind a smaller back-pocket label.  Pointer's Carpenter Jeans are more subtle (and less expensive!)
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,MazeppaPZ,2,Wed Jun 3 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good branding style. Not the slim fit that I think a lot of us around here are looking for though, haha."
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,pointerbrand,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"You are looking for slimmer, or looser?"
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,pointerbrand,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the carpenter jeans. They're too loose for most of us around here but they're more work oriented anyway, right? The jeans/chinos you have for sale on Massdrop look like a pretty slim cut that'll have a decently broad appeal."
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,pointerbrand,2,Thu Jun 4 02:51:29 2015 UTC,"Carpenter are very loose...high waist, low crotch...meant for work (a cut we haven't really changed in 60 years). The brown duck skinny (current listed on mass drop) are definitely a true ""skinny""....the pictures on our site show it more appropriate to its fit - https://www.pointerbrand.com/index.php/jeans-men/skinny-jeans/brown-duck-skinny-jeans.html"
frugalmalefashion,38c4pl,JonNYBlazinAzN,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think most of us here are complaining about the giant black label on the back pocket. A small label would be okay, perhaps closer to the waistline (I.e. What you normally see on jeans), but what's there now is a little bit on the loud side. The carpenter jeans linked below I think have a branding style that'd be a lot more palatable to most of us around here, but I kind of like the current blacked out front pocket square."

They approximate the regular BB ones in terms of cut.  This was a ""suit separates"" deal. where they had the pants and coat separate.  Really nice suit IMO, qtr lined.  It is made in China or Thailand (can't remember).  Mainline BB is made in Italy and US.  So, you can get a better deal, but if you need a suit NOW, this is ok."

frugalmalefashion,388xej,DoctorBigtime,3,Tue Jun 2 20:22:57 2015 UTC,It's a great beater suit for those that aren't into the short jacket/skinny lapel aesthetic. Also a very good deal for those who only wear suits to weddings and funerals.

If you wear a suit to work regularly, it'll fall apart within a couple years. My pants wore thin/threadbare on my ass-- like my whole ass. My regular Brooks Brothers suit has held up much better.

frugalmalefashion,388xej,Vinegar_strokes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:28:10 2015 UTC,How do people buy suits online? Is it with the full expectation you'll need to tailor them?
frugalmalefashion,388xej,RIP_KING,10,Tue Jun 2 21:05:23 2015 UTC,you should have the full expectation to take a suit in for tailoring regardless of where you buy it unless you're having it custom made.
frugalmalefashion,388xej,Citizen_V,3,Tue Jun 2 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"I imagine so but even when I buy suits in person, I need to tailor them because none are perfect (sleeves and pants are always too long for me; jacket sides typically need to be taken in). You can always return them if the fit is extremely off though."

frugalmalefashion,3882lc,mcadamsandwich,20,Tue Jun 2 22:25:50 2015 UTC,Disclosure: I am the one selling these. This will be my second drop for these minimalist card holders. They're made from Japanese Shell Cordovan (from the Shinki Hikaku tannery).  All wallets are hand stitched and the edges are burnished with natural beeswax. Here are a bunch of photos from the first drop in case you're wanting to see additional photos. These will be shipped by July 7th at the latest.   Let me know if you have any questions!
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,mcadamsandwich,3,Tue Jun 2 14:58:50 2015 UTC,How many more cards would you say the card holder would fit upon expanding?
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,Grinolam,3,Tue Jun 2 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"I would say after use, 6 and some bills."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,Grinolam,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:45:24 2015 UTC,I had a similar card holder for awhile. I'd say the max is 6 total after stretching.
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,downhiller2010,2,Tue Jun 2 17:42:55 2015 UTC,How many business cards can it hold?
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,ohsemantics,2,Tue Jun 2 17:51:08 2015 UTC,Sorry for the delay - I wanted to check for myself when I got home. I have standard sized business cards which are of a little bit thicker stock. I fit 14 in there without it being broken in. I could probably put more in if I wanted.

frugalmalefashion,3882lc,mcadamsandwich,4,Tue Jun 2 20:20:05 2015 UTC,This is Shinki Hikaku Shell Cordovan from Japan and not Horween. They are finished slightly different.
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,drwl,3,Tue Jun 2 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"Also somewhat of a side question but I've been meaning to switch to a card holder for a long time but always hesitate because I'm worried it might fall out of my pocket more easily without me noticing and because I don't want to take out all my cards every time to get the right one, potentially losing something (I'm like ridiculously clumsy lol, hence the concern). For people who've made the switch, were these actually issues for you or are you able to develop an efficient system over time? Thanks!"
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,mcadamsandwich,7,Tue Jun 2 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"I switched from a regular bi-fold to a card wallet a few years ago. In addition to the physical change, it's also a change in mindset where you only carry what you need on a day-to-day basis. Debit card, credit card, driver's license, student ID/handgun permit, etc.   Anything else stays in a separate wallet at home or in the car. Get rid of those receipts, insurance cards, family photos, etc. Keep those things on your phone - you rarely need those anyways, so save weight and bulk where you can.  In the two years I carried one, I never lost it or anything in it. You'll have to check your pocket for awhile, because it feels empty, but it'll be there."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,2,Tue Jun 2 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Having used both, I can say that going back to a full wallet was very pleasant when I wanted to have all my rewards memberships. i.e.: aeroplan card used once a month. two different country credit cards used every two months. a lot easier to not forget things.

frugalmalefashion,3882lc,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,2,Tue Jun 2 21:36:16 2015 UTC,Take a photo of both sides and archive it online. You don't really need the physical card if you can see it on your phone.

frugalmalefashion,3882lc,limenuke,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"I agree it's not a big deal, which is why it seems silly to remove it for the convenience of saving a fraction of a millimeter of card space.  For sure leave the zipcard and the extra metro cards and the receipts and the grocery card and the college ID at home, but I feel that most health professionals would agree that carrying insurance is a good idea (the way carrying an driver's license or your work building ID or credit cards is a good idea).    But for sure, buck the norm and scan a pic in your phone...there is clearly no downside and it would anyways be heavily outweighed by the upside of not having to lug that sucker around."

It's just that it's not as big a deal one way or the other.   I was admitted to the ER a while back and nobody gave a damn about insurance -- at least at that hospital -- until I was ambulatory. If I don't have my card at my doctor's office, they roll with it.   My kids are on a different plan and each have two cards. If I don't have them at the doctor's office, I ask they look them up. There have been systems to verify this information for a long time.    I feel that most health professionals would agree that carrying insurance is a good idea   Because nobody wants hassle from the business office. But I know health professionals are primarily concerned with making sure care is delivered. Have the card or don't. Especially in critical situations you'll get care. It's not as dire as you made it sound initially.   Edit: Also, to your initial point, if EMS is checking your insurance rather than providing care, something's seriously screwed up."

This system works pretty well, especially since I'm rarely carrying cash.   Right now I'm carrying a billfold to get some aged shots and use notes for my website. It definitely feels weird to go back."

frugalmalefashion,3882lc,de_la_seoul_,8,Tue Jun 2 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"$60? Wow. I'm sure the quality of the material is great, but my $14 Saddleback Leather Slim is still as strong as ever and looks great after four years of heavy use."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,lesism0r,18,Tue Jun 2 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yea except this is shell which costs a considerable amount more than the leather that Saddleback uses for their wallets.   It's like comparing a bologna sandwich to a lobster sandwich. Both sandwiches, both fill you up, but one is clearly better and costs much more to make which makes it cost much more to buy."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,limenuke,16,Tue Jun 2 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"No, bologna and lobster taste different and are exposed to us for different amounts of time.  This is more like having two pieces of paper that may feel just slightly different, because one is made from special trees. But one piece costs $1/sheet, and the other costs $0.20/sheet. You get the same utility out of it. Few people can tell the difference."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,lesism0r,12,Tue Jun 2 19:52:34 2015 UTC,"I bet shell and the leather Saddleback use taste different. That's besides the point though.   Getting the same utility as in use, yea probably. Getting the same utility as in satisfaction? Maybe but that's very subjective. Then again when do people on these subs just buy things for the sheer use of it and not quality or value?   I bet if you walked up to a random person with a guarded goods shell card holder and a Saddleback one, they'd easily be able to pick the better quality leather and card holder.   If you don't value shell or handmade goods that's fine. But some do and the price is a good one for that."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,akaghi,21,Tue Jun 2 20:09:19 2015 UTC,Can confirm. My Cordovan shoes smell and taste great. My Saddleback wallet doesn't smell as great and tastes like ass. My wallet is under my butt and exposed to farts though.

frugalmalefashion,3882lc,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:14:35 2015 UTC,"$60 for two flaps of leather stitched together is expensive any way you slice it. What makes you believe that this is a particularly good price for this? What are your comparisons in the market?  EDIT: Looked at shell stuff, decided this is a decent price for what it is, still don't think it's a design that's beautiful enough to warrant paying $60 for. Akin to spending $50k on a carbon fibre toilet."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,masterful7086,10,Tue Jun 2 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"The cost of anything shell, it's pretty easy to see for yourself basically anywhere that sells anything shell. That plus the work of making it and the skill of the maker. All that combines to make this a reasonable priced item."
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,sirblastalot,10,Tue Jun 2 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"There's nothing frugal about a fucking $60 wallet, especially a wallet that's not even a wallet.   You can extend that argument to damn near every ""luxury"" possible, fashion especially.  Why buy a OCBD from Uniqlo for thirty bucks when I can buy a five-pack of Hanes tees from Walmart for five bucks? They both essentially serve the same function, right?  Why spend ten bucks on a velcro wallet from Walmart when I can make one out of duct tape for pennies? They both essentially serve the same function, right?"
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,spykid,2,Tue Jun 2 21:00:10 2015 UTC,You don't get the same utility out of both leathers. Shell cordovan will look better for much longer than Saddleback leather.
frugalmalefashion,3882lc,masterful7086,-2,Tue Jun 2 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's a card holder. Made of two pieces of leather. It's a practical, minimalistic piece - not a fashion statement. How much better it looks over the saddleback is largely trivial. Especially in the context of frugalmalefashion. My 0.02, but I see where you're coming from.

frugalmalefashion,383rdu,6ca,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:33:10 2015 UTC,I bought them when they were on sale for $150. They are gorgeous boots but they are very heavy and not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Like I said they are beautiful boots nonetheless and I dont regret buying them.
frugalmalefashion,383rdu,Xmonster_energyX,10,Mon Jun 1 23:03:28 2015 UTC,"Nordstrom matched $174 (over the phone) even though they didn't have the exact color.

frugalmalefashion,383bwc,Hyperbole13,5,Mon Jun 1 17:37:34 2015 UTC,My best advice would be to go to blueowl and look at the measurements for the particular pair of n&f to compare measurements to your pair of levis.
frugalmalefashion,383bwc,mexican_swag,2,Mon Jun 1 22:35:45 2015 UTC,according to all the reviews and other forms that i read online all recommended one size down as they stretch. this is the case if you buy this and this are Raw without the stretch fabric.

frugalmalefashion,383bwc,whatamiwearing,10,Mon Jun 1 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"He told you wrong, Levi's uses vanity sizing so a size 32 will fit a 34"" waist whereas N&F is more true to size. For example: for my 34.5"" waist I wear a 32 in Levi's and a 34 in N&F, I can fit in a 33 N&F but then the thighs are too tight for full range of movement. Check out size charts for naked and famous at BlueOwl and then measure your best fitting jeans to see what size you need."

frugalmalefashion,383bwc,amtehrani,2,Mon Jun 1 23:36:03 2015 UTC,Each denim stretches differently but typically for 100% cotton you can expect an inch in the waist and minimal stretching everywhere else. Unbranded is more notorious for stretching out.

frugalmalefashion,38133z,Dwi11,2,Mon Jun 1 11:11:40 2015 UTC,Is leather cleaner really necessary?  Is water + a cloth rag not enough to clean?  Edit:  It seems I've worded my question poorly.  I'm actually curious.
frugalmalefashion,38133z,YourMoneyOrYourLife,2,Mon Jun 1 02:27:04 2015 UTC,I would direct you to the leather cleaning guide
frugalmalefashion,38133z,MrMacMan23,3,Mon Jun 1 02:33:51 2015 UTC,I visit GYW pretty regularly and I've mostly heard people saying to wipe down with a damp cloth and condition and rarely about using actual leather cleaner.  And the guide doesn't say much about whether leather cleaners are really necessary.
frugalmalefashion,38133z,YourMoneyOrYourLife,6,Mon Jun 1 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely curious now, I've been just wiping off all the dirt off my leather shoes then putting polish on them to keep them shiny."
frugalmalefashion,38133z,bearzy,0,Mon Jun 1 03:37:47 2015 UTC,"You should use leather conditioner when your leather feels dry. You should be using it on occasion, perhaps every 20 wears or so."
frugalmalefashion,38133z,oOoWTFMATE,4,Mon Jun 1 04:26:17 2015 UTC,"That seems way too frequent. I condition my IRs about once every 4-6 months, depending on how the leather feels. I wear them almost daily."
frugalmalefashion,38133z,_RacecaRacecaR_,3,Mon Jun 1 09:56:28 2015 UTC,"You only need a leather cleaner if your boots are filthy. Generally, wiping them down more regularly avoids ever having to use a leather cleaner."
frugalmalefashion,38133z,akaghi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:01:25 2015 UTC,That's because using leather condition is self explanatory. You put it onto the leather and rub it in.
frugalmalefashion,38133z,oOoWTFMATE,2,Mon Jun 1 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"Im talking about cleaner, not conditioner.  As in, is leather cleaner really needed when a damp cloth seems to do the trick with cleaning."
frugalmalefashion,38133z,YourMoneyOrYourLife,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:28:02 2015 UTC,Cleaner is necessary when a damp cloth doesn't do the trick. It's for when you've neglected your shoes to the point where water or even a water/vinegar solution isn't doing much to help.
frugalmalefashion,38133z,oOoWTFMATE,0,Mon Jun 1 04:32:59 2015 UTC,I hope you don't clean your leather products with water...
frugalmalefashion,38133z,wilsonhhuang,4,Mon Jun 1 02:37:32 2015 UTC,Why not?  I'm just wiping off dirt and salt.
frugalmalefashion,38133z,YourMoneyOrYourLife,2,Mon Jun 1 02:50:29 2015 UTC,"If you're just wiping off dirt and salt, I hope you're using a cloth rag only (or are using water to a minimal extent). To keep the leather healthy, you need to take proper care of it.  Think of it as skin-care - sometimes people need lotions and chap stick (dry skin is a bitch to deal with). Leather is pretty much skin (to an extent), so it dries out and needs to be taken of properly if you want leather products to last."
frugalmalefashion,38133z,elchismoso,5,Mon Jun 1 03:04:01 2015 UTC,I wipe off the dirt when its dirty with a damp cloth and i condition it when need be.

For most of the people on here that baby their leather, it's not necessary. If your leathers do look a little on the dirty side though, you'll need a little more than water. mix 1/3 white vinegar and water and wipe your boots down with that. And then condition them.

frugalmalefashion,37z3s6,donkeyrocket,9,Mon Jun 1 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"So I bought a couple of these the last time they went on sale and they aren't what I expected. A lot of the reviews I read said wearing these feels like you have nothing on. In my experience, they have been tight at the waist and ride upon the legs. I am 5'8"" 145 lbs with a 31.5"" waist and ordered a small with some advice from reading other people's reviews. I would have probably gotten a medium if I could go back, but then again I am used to wearing loose boxer shorts and I'm not sure if maybe these are supposed to fit the way they do."
frugalmalefashion,37z3s6,Kaiberoamin,5,Sun May 31 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"The medium is much looser at the waist size. No support at all, and they move around a lot.

frugalmalefashion,37z3s6,Changinghand,3,Sun May 31 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"Having also owned these, I agree. Furthermore, for some reason they have a TON of material in the front between the groin area and the waistband, and not enough material to keep my butt covered in the back. So they are constantly bunched up in the front, and getting pulled down in the back.  Get Uniqlo boxer briefs instead. I like the cotton/poly blend for everyday wear, and the all-poly (airism?) for outdoor activities. Thoe airisms actually do feel like you're wearing nothing at all. They're also cheaper than ExOfficio, even on sale."

In light suede they can go very casual--think high-top sneaker."

frugalmalefashion,37wdbz,bamgrinus,5,Sat May 30 23:16:41 2015 UTC,So anyone down voting care to elaborate? I want some damn good socks and all I've heard is good about smart wool.
frugalmalefashion,37wdbz,glenglenglen87,3,Sat May 30 23:34:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't down vote, but smart wool makes a quality product. I prefer darn tough* because of their lifetime guarantee, however."
frugalmalefashion,37wdbz,Aaahh_real_people,3,Sun May 31 02:28:38 2015 UTC,I've owned several pairs of smart wool socks and darn tough is where it's at!  Smart wool socks just wear out wayyy to fast.
frugalmalefashion,37wdbz,dangerous_dave,3,Sun May 31 16:53:18 2015 UTC,That's good to know. It looks like they're only a few bucks more too so I might just go that route. Thanks for the help!

Perhaps they aren't as durable even though I have Smartwool socks that I've had for 5+ years, but they are hell of a lot more comfortable in my book. They just have a smoother, frictionless inside surface."

frugalmalefashion,37wdbz,wilsonhhuang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:38:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been trying different brands of no-shows for awhile, including every different iteration of Ninja Sox.  This is the first time I've seen one made from Merino, which most people will tell you is a far better material for socks due its durability, moisture wicking, and temperature regulating properties.  They have silicon up the heel, like a lot of brands, but these have a pretty solid strip instead of just a little nub.  They're not cut super low on the sides like the Ninja Sox are, which might give some people problems with showing (I haven't had any), but I think having the elastic band go all the way around helps with keeping them up.  They're also thinner than the Ninja Sox, more like a liner sock, but a tiny bit thicker.  The elastic seems like really good quality too, since I feel like they wear down quickly with some other brands.  Overall, I'm so sick of trying different kinds, and I'm willing to pay a premium for one that just works the way it should.  As a bonus, the XL size fits my big-ass feet pretty well, too."

Think of it as a kind of chemical castration—of the cotton fibers, if not the wearer. Those chemicals probably account for the odor emanating from some of these shirts when they're new. A really nice one I got at my favorite store, Nordstrom, smells like the New Jersey Turnpike around Exit 13, even after three washings."
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,RecycledAccountName,4,Sun May 31 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"Non-iron shirts are undoubtedly not as soft to touch, but the smell doesn't linger. Assuming there's no other effects from the formaldehyde, it really boils down to convenience vs. comfort and which one you value more. I think the author exaggerates how bad it feels, but I also wear an undershirt with my non-iron shirts so it's really just my arms and neck that touch it."
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,ginNtronic,1 point,Sun May 31 20:41:54 2015 UTC,Am I doing something wrong?  I got a non-iron shirt from J-Crew recently and it wrinkles like crazy.  Never. again.
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,akcom,2,Fri Jun 5 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"It's possible jcrew just did a poor job of treating the shirt to make it non-iron. I would say BB shirts are typically better quality than jcrew, so that likely has a role to play.   You should know that the more you wash a non-iron shirt, the more the non-iron properties wear off to an extent. Further, if you wash a non-iron shirt and let it dry fully in the dryer, it will still be wrinkly like any other shirt. If possible, it's best to hang dry, or at the very least, take it out of the dryer part way through."
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,ginNtronic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you!  I didn't know that thing about drying fully.  If I don't dry it fully, do I just let it hang dry for the remainder? If I'm not particularly concerned about the feeling of the cloth, should I definitely go with non-iron over the regular?  Or are there other things to consider?"
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,akcom,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah just pop it on a hanger to dry. I much prefer non iron because regular shirts wrinkle much more easily--even from just sitting on the train during my commute. Its annoying when I get to work and my shirt is already wrinkled. You will still have to iron non-iron shirts occasionally, but it won't be as often because they should maintain their shape better."
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,ginNtronic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"I don't own any BB non-irons.  However, from what I've read elsewhere, BB is as good as it gets because it's a ""true"" non-iron and isn't wrinkly.  I think it's generally considered non-iron for 80 washes (might be considerably less), then you need to iron it like any other shirt."
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,NeverNoMore,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"My concern isn't whether or not it's a true non iron, my concern is the process of treating the fabric to make it ""non-iron"".

I haven't thrown on a non-iron shirt in a while, but i remember this being pretty accurate when i bought one a few years back."
frugalmalefashion,37vecq,RecycledAccountName,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the person who said the shoulders and arms are similar.

I couldn't remember the name for the longest time but now that I found it again I bought 5 more packs.  They're on the thicker side so they're probably better for casual shoes than dress shoes. They feel more substantial than most other no-shows I've found (like ones from UO which all have holes in the toe now). The ones I bought from JCP have held up well, from everything I can tell these are the same style.

frugalmalefashion,37t4nm,GoFidoGo,2,Sat May 30 07:33:54 2015 UTC,Why are cushy soft socks bad for dress shoes? Why are all dress socks so thin?
frugalmalefashion,37t4nm,BigBayesian,2,Sat May 30 07:38:57 2015 UTC,"It's not a principled thing. Most dress socks are thin, so your dress shoes will fit you best wearing thin socks (at least, if you're smart, and try the, on wearing thin socks). So thick socks would make your foot too big.   If you're wondering why dress socks tend to be thin, I think there's a sleekness / elegance thing going on that doesn't work with thick socks, at least conventionally."
frugalmalefashion,37t4nm,bamgrinus,1 point,Sat May 30 11:02:46 2015 UTC,"Dress shoes are made to fit more tightly around the foot with usually just a single thin layer of leather lining the inside of the upper, unlike sneakers which tend to have significant amounts of padding inside.  That means only a thin dress sock will fit.  And as for why they're that way...you have to keep in mind that a lot of our conventions around men's formal dress date back to times when people had much stronger ideas about class.  A gentleman's shoe wouldn't have excessive padding or something with more grip than a leather outsole because a gentleman should never be engaging in activities that would require more."

They have a neat rubber grip inside the sock where your heel would go. So they don't slip at all! Also really comfortable. The only thing is there a bit pricey, I think I spent a little over $40 for my pack of 4. I'm going to get a pair of these too though, for $6 you can't go wrong haha"

frugalmalefashion,37t4nm,Bazofwaz,5,Sat May 30 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"People care about socks. And yes, whether your socks are showing or not is actually a detail that people will notice. Will everyone notice? No, but some do.   I care. I notice. Others do, too. I have an entire drawer full of socks to be worn with different shoes on different occasions. Your opinion on the importance of socks is not the only one, and doesn't happen to be the majority one in the fashion community or even on this subreddit."
frugalmalefashion,37t4nm,cobaltorange,2,Sat May 30 13:43:19 2015 UTC,Some shoes are meant to be worn with no socks or no-show socks.   I guess the patterns are for when you take your shoes off and are lounging around.

frugalmalefashion,37xc37,ohhiyathere,3,Sun May 31 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"Not very good. I'd avoid Aldo. The Mr. B line is supposed to be a lot better, but most stuff outside of that is terrible."
frugalmalefashion,37te69,daem0nn,8,Sat May 30 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"Great comfortable boot. Great price. To the guy complaining about the white sole: just wear them in the backyard for an afternoon and your soles will get nice and brownish.  Also, these are GY welted so you can resole them when you wear down the sole.  I think the canvas sides make the boot more breathable, which is important to me."
frugalmalefashion,37te69,shiny69,7,Sat May 30 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"I think the white soles are just fine. The rest of the boot though... not very good looking.  For $130 you're getting decent value for your money if you don't care about looks... but it you do care there are much better choices out there, and if you only care about toughness/durability/function then there are better choices too, for not much more money.  There's definitely some good quality to these boots but there's also a reason they're on sale this cheap."

I've started favoring shoes from GMTOs since I can often get them in a 13.5 even if that's not a normal stock size. FWIW, addidas does a 13.5 on some models. Alden works well, too, since they tend to run a half size large on their more popular lasts. Nike sometimes works, since they run at least a half size small, but sometimes a 14 in Nike is too small for me."

I used these measurements when I ordered and it was pretty accurate: http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/2aitbu/baldwin_denim_20_off_entire_site/civtadg They are on the skinnier side of a slim fit.  Ive had them for about 6 months and have worn them at least 5 days a week since january. My waist at where I wear these is about a 31.5 (I was previously around a 31 but gained a bit of weight since then) and I went with a 28. The waist has stretched a little less than an inch since I first got them, and there was slight stretch in the thigh. I will say that the rise is pretty low and can get uncomfortable. I could have gotten away with a 29 because the rise is very low.

They generally don't take returns but I called them and thankfully they just gave me a refund because I was so disappointed in the quality."
frugalmalefashion,37mk7j,limenuke,2,Thu May 28 19:02:53 2015 UTC,Pro tip: shoe quality is difficult to get right. Don't buy shoes from a brand which hasn't had experience in making shoes.
frugalmalefashion,37mk7j,SaintsDynasty,2,Thu May 28 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"Their clothes tend to be on the slimmer side for sure.  Their shoes are generally lower quality, but they do offer you store credit for repairs required if needed, something I had to go through on a pair (stitching).  Jasper oxford is their best fitting shirt, their tees are definitely slim. Pants are decent quality, but they are pretty much straight from the calf with no real taper to the ankle.  For the price, its a good deal, I wouldn't pay full price for any of their items though."

frugalmalefashion,37ljuj,sklark23,14,Thu May 28 17:35:30 2015 UTC,That is one definition. It also means  characterized by or reflecting economy in the use of resources  which also means getting something cheaper than you would normally
frugalmalefashion,37ljuj,OneHorseMan,-2,Thu May 28 17:42:42 2015 UTC,Right.  People usually have a combination of the two as their personal working definition.

Most people wouldn't consider that frugal. It was something of a splurge, but they would normally cost around $1200. They're unique, well made, and will last me forever. amortized over their lifetime, $30-40 per year doesn't seem too bad.   But it is definitely a luxury."

frugalmalefashion,37qpxg,willywanka92,13,Fri May 29 17:12:03 2015 UTC,Don't waste your money. Five four club clothes are pretty poor quality and the fit varies from box to box. Not one item I liked out of the 6 months I was subscribed to them. It was a pain in the ass to cancel like the other poster said.
frugalmalefashion,37qpxg,tman5890,7,Fri May 29 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, honestly, don't even bother. I did it for a few months last year and only got one item that I still wear. The rest I've thrown out or given to charity.  1) Cheap looking, terrible quality. I got several t-shirts, that within minutes of wearing them they got completely stretched out.  2) They're style guide is terrible. I first chose the fashion forward option, but everything I got was a cheap Armani Exchange knock off. Then I switched to casual, and it was mostly dadcore. Lots of ill fitting clothes. I got baggy cargo shorts twice.  3) They paid no attention to your color preferences. I said blue is my favorite. Just about every single item I every got was black.  4) They sent me the same items over and over, just in different colors. They sent it to me last month in black, so this month they'll send it to me in white.  5) They do not accept exchanges except for a new fit. Didn't like anything in the box last month? Too bad.  6) No way to cancel on line. You have to call them, and speak with a sales representative who will do everything they can to convince you to continue subscribing."

When you first try on the Beeswax, it's hard and uncomfortable. It feels like you need a few days to a week to break it in. And it makes hard creases at the bends.

Imo I think even at just under $100, I think CDBs/Bushacres are a great deal if only because they can last a ridiculously long time for the price you're paying for them, even without taking care of the leather."

While there are different reasons for why people justify various price points, to me, at least, so long as it can last a while, it's worth whatever price tag it comes with, as long as it isn't exorbitant. It doesn't matter to me how complex the construction is, or how much leather they used, or what kind of leather they used.

The funny thing is that the prices were so inexpensive for a while that I thought they were going out of style.  They've been popular for several years now and it's about time.  On last look, their value on eBay had plummeted from what it had been in year's past, so I'd recommend checking for them there."

frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,Empereur_Nabroleon,2,Sun Jun 21 01:41:40 2015 UTC,They were almost certainly Bushacre IIs
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,Tkachenko,2,Thu May 28 00:10:14 2015 UTC,Yup. Kinda wish ppl looked it up first but oh well.
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,Empereur_Nabroleon,1 point,Thu May 28 00:57:14 2015 UTC,I've tried to find out the difference between bushacre and bushacre ii's but haven't found anything. Could you explain what the difference is?
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,wilsonhhuang,1 point,Thu May 28 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"Well, the ones posted here are the original desert boots, which are considered to be much more sturdy and have a better sole than the Bushacre IIs. I think the white contrast sole looks better too. That's just want I've picked up about them. Not too sure on specifics"
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,WEST_BROMWICH_ALBION,2,Thu May 28 06:54:16 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm actually looking for bushacres due to the synthetic sole rather than the crepe. I live on the west coast and crepe just wont handle the wet."

frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,eddrix,-1,Wed May 27 21:14:05 2015 UTC,I saw about four pairs of desert boots between two racks on sunday/monday.
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,IAmTheKingOfSpain,2,Wed May 27 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"probably bushacres , the sole is not the same as pointed by fukdot. The rack ones dont have the crepe soles. these last longer"
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,Blkdrgn415,-1,Wed May 27 22:05:15 2015 UTC,I can only go by what the boxes said as I didn't know the specific differences. It is possible they put Bushacres in Desert Boot boxes repeatedly though.
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,IAmTheKingOfSpain,0,Thu May 28 00:13:00 2015 UTC,"I generally wear 10/10.5s (recently bought Vans 10s, which fit, but couldn't comfortably go any smaller). Should I go for 9s, 9.5s or 10s? Also, what's the most versatile color? Mustard? Tobacco?"
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,Blkdrgn415,1 point,Thu May 28 10:02:02 2015 UTC,The general rule is half a size. So whatever your true shoe size is. Go with Beeswax. It is the most versatile color that will also fade where you stress it.
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,AberNatuerlich,0,Wed May 27 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"I wear 10.5s for Nikes usually, and 10s in Adidas and Vans. So you think I should order 9.5s?"
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,IAmTheKingOfSpain,1 point,Wed May 27 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"Vans are true to size, so I would say at least. To be honest, it's best to go to a store and try them on. They are boots, so you want it to be snug near the balls of your feet and enough so there is no heel slippage during the break in period (they hurt a lot). Without knowing your Brannock measurements, it's hard to say for sure, but 9.5 should fit at the least. The worst case is that there is a slight slippage and in that case, you would have to wear thick socks to compensate during the break in period."
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,Blkdrgn415,1 point,Wed May 27 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"So, go a half-size down from your brannock?"

I tried the 9s on, and I could get them on. They were decently tight, but not ridiculously so, and she said they're gonna stretch for sure. So I think I might just order the 9s. Edit: Damn, they sold out of the 9s. I'm sad :( Should I get a different colour, or should I hold out for a similar sale in the future?"
frugalmalefashion,37hs2z,IAmTheKingOfSpain,1 point,Thu May 28 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"It varies from person to person for sizing. Honestly, CDB go on sale so often that you won't have to wait long. They should be at their cheapest at the end of the season. I wouldn't get Clark's in any other color aside from Beeswax, but that depends on what you think looks best."

I bought size 10 Moc Toes and they're roomy, could have gone down to 9.5 (but didn't because I found a clearance pair in the US for $99).

frugalmalefashion,37g2an,swishersplitter,3,Wed May 27 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"Second the NATO strap idea, but with another addition:  One of the cool things about the NATO design is that you only have to mess with the spring bars once, then you can swap straps with next to no effort or practice in literally about ten seconds. Vwoop off, vwoop on.  So, instead of getting one strap for $12 + tax + s/h, get ten different colors/designs from Alibaba for about twice as much, total.  I had a great experience with this seller, though I got 20mm straps for a different style watch. I think I paid about $22 to the doorstep. I do have the SNK803 on a blue NATO and it works very well.  Another additional feature of the NATO is that in the, albeit unlikely, event that either one spring bar breaks, you don't lose the watch or strap."

frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,crj3012,2,Wed May 27 18:22:49 2015 UTC,It's not often you find a CXL goodyear welt boot for $150.

frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,imagoodusername,2,Thu May 28 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno. They're both the same leather (as far as I know) and this is half the price. there's something to be said for that. but, yeah, there's also something to be said for getting exactly the brand you want, once you're up in the $150+ tier."

frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,blaster99,1 point,Wed May 27 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"Owned a pair of Thorogoods that I have put to pretty heavy use for 3 years and I like them as much, if not more, than my Red Wings. When it comes to aesthetics, that's up to you. Just like any higher end work boot, beat the shit out of them, but take care of them accordingly."
frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,hikkikike,1 point,Thu May 28 03:58:21 2015 UTC,"Anyone know about the quality of these? I couldn't find much about the brand online. I decided to go ahead and order it based on the description, I figure I can just take it in to the store if I don't like it and it won't cost me anything."
frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,bigsnood,1 point,Wed May 27 23:16:33 2015 UTC,"Thorogood is a respected made in USA bootmaker. Horween is a legendary Chicago tannery (they make the leather for NFL footballs, and are the only manufacturer of shell cordovan left in the US...maybe the entire Western Hemisphere).   The shock absorption footbed is... different...I would have expected a leather insole. But for the price I think you'll be happy."
frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,samsturtevant,1 point,Thu May 28 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I checked their website and it said they were made in the USA which is great, that was the reason I decided to buy them.  Can you give any more detail about the footbed? The last pair of boots I bought were chipewas (sp) with these rock hard vibram soles that hurt my feet like crazy so I ended up returning them. If this one is soft and springy that sounds perfect for me, as I've only ever owned sneakers and Clark's boots."
frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,brutallyhonestharvey,1 point,Thu May 28 00:22:06 2015 UTC,"Hard to know. I'd actually be interested to hear what they are like when you get them.   However the Chippewa experience you had may have been related more to the insole than the outsole. A leather insole is a shock for many people when they first get them, and they do take some time to break in. Once they do, though, they are pretty comfy. My Nicks boots have leather insoles and Vibram outsoles and they are my favorite pair to wear."
frugalmalefashion,37h8hf,samsturtevant,1 point,Thu May 28 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"I bought these a few weeks ago and ended up returning them.   The construction seems solid, but I just didn't care for the looks of them.  The shape of the rear of the boots looked somewhat odd, partially because of the lack of stitching by the heel and partially because they lacked the shape that's shown in the picture.  The leather sort of just comes straight up from the sole with no sort of contour to it.    I'd suggest spending just $30 more and getting a pair of plain-toe Katahdins when LL Bean has 20% off. I couldn't be happier with mine.  I think they're well worth the extra cost."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,Coolingritu,12,Thu May 28 21:09:34 2015 UTC,"It's a ""vintage"" $30 Timex Easy Reader on a $1 Horween CXL band. Not really a great value.  You can buy something similar from Shawn @ Form * Function * Form for $88 shipped all day long."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,mcadamsandwich,4,Thu May 28 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"That's like saying Nikes are $0.80 or foam and rubber.  Sure it's true, but referring to raw costs is silly. You're also ignoring all overhead, labor, etc."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,akaghi,3,Fri May 29 12:34:40 2015 UTC,I'd love to know where I can get one cxl watch band for a dollar... obviously even $90 is pretty steep for what you're getting but no need for ridiculous exaggeration.
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,antisocialmogul,-2,Fri May 29 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I was exaggerating a bit, but $60+ for a leather strap that may cost them $2-$5 to produce is terrible. Wholesale/bulk pricing makes that strap super cheap to make.   The cheapest retail I've seen is $12 for a NATO style, or $20 for a two piece. That's still much cheaper than most places charge for something similar, and even that dude has to be making profit."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,mcadamsandwich,2,Fri May 29 03:25:44 2015 UTC,You can buy the Easy Reader for <$30 on Amazon and a $12 strap from Lakehouse Leathers on Etsy as well.
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,ashoelace,9,Thu May 28 22:48:19 2015 UTC,I've personally had bad experience with lakehouse. The locking mechanism collapsed the first day. Owner didn't respond.
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,Tkachenko,3,Fri May 29 00:56:39 2015 UTC,Where can I get a Horween CXL band for $1? I'd like to get some watch straps for my existing watches.
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,flashcats,-4,Thu May 28 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"Brown CXL runs about $5.50/sq.ft. (firsts quality) with the caveat that you have to order more than that...typically a whole side. However, you could make 10-12 straps from each square foot, assuming there are no imperfections."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,mcadamsandwich,10,Fri May 29 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"I want one watch strap, not 10-12 strips of leather.  If I give you a $1, will you sell me a band like the one pictured? Do you think anyone would?"
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,flashcats,-1,Fri May 29 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"CXL, strap hardware, labor... The cost to make one is probably about $4. A reasonable price would be about $15."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,aldenhg,4,Fri May 29 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"OK, where can I get it for $15? Heck, I'll give you $20. Will you make it for me like the one pictured?  That's an easy $5 profit for you."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,flashcats,0,Fri May 29 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I have that color if CXL on hand but it's too heavy for a watch strap, so I'll have to thin it down. I don't have any watch strap hardware, but I have a nice small 3/4 inch roller buckle. Also I don't like the red lacing... I would probably use rivets if they would fit or a natural linen thread and lack the sides instead of the center.   But yeah, I could do that for $20."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,aldenhg,2,Fri May 29 18:17:29 2015 UTC,Sure. Let's do it. Can you send me a mock up or something?
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,flashcats,1 point,Fri May 29 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"You're putting $20 worth of faith in a stranger on the internet not lying to you. But no, I don't really want to make a one-off watch strap. The CXL I've got is heavy and I would rather save it for something that needs heavy leather. I could buy some lighter stuff but then I would need to make and sell more and we're back to economics."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,aldenhg,1 point,Fri May 29 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that we have a lot of complainers about how the watch is overprice, but when push comes to shove, no one can actually prove that the strap (or the watch) is overpriced.  First a guy says it's a $1 strap.  Now you say it's a $15 strap.  I offer you $20 and you say ""I could do that for $20"", but when it comes to putting your money where your mouth is, suddenly it doesn't happen.  What that tells me is that we have a whole lot of bullshitters on here.  Edit: Hell, how about this: you find me a watch strap that looks like the one pictured for $15 and I'll Paypal you $5 for a finder's fee. How does that sound? You don't need to use up your leather and you still get the net profit."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,flashcats,2,Fri May 29 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"I have had this for more than a year. You can sometimes get it cheaper as well, I got mine for $25.  This is far and above the one fashion related item that I own that has got the most compliments."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,Madeeg,2,Thu May 28 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"I own the Seiko 5, and it looks very similar. I get compliments on it all the time too."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,play_it_safe,2,Thu May 28 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"Okay - everyone who down-voted this - I agree that you could home-brew it cheaper, but the sale price isn't unreasonable at all, the product's very cool (that's a really great watch, although not a really expensive one), and you certainly can't find it cheaper.  Just because you could whip it up yourself cheaper doesn't make it a bad price.  Just because you think it's ugly doesn't make it a bad price.    That said, just because you can point to lake house leathers + amazon OR FFF for a better price kindof does.  Unless you think that strap is super awesome.  Which I don't, but you might.    But the deal, at least if you respect the strap, is still legit.  If you don't respect the strap, the deal was never legit, and you can buy the watch on amazon for $20-30 any day of the week."
frugalmalefashion,37n3oj,BigBayesian,6,Fri May 29 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"I like the design, but dislike the premium-priced 'americana/heritage' marketing thing they're going for when it's just a timex that they claim was worth $175.   This watch isn't any more ""trusty"" than another timex watch, it just caters to a hipster aesthetic where 20-somethings get a huge hard-on for american vintage-looking shit and that's the main reason you pay so much. Notice how the model picture is unfailingly some tanned, scruffy, flannel-wearing guy that looks like he's got his shit together despite probably working as a freelance graphic designer. I subscribe to that lifestyle, and their marketing thing clearly worked, but at the same time it is important to be aware of what you are being sold."

frugalmalefashion,37glji,pocketfool,1 point,Wed May 27 17:12:09 2015 UTC,Can you compare the fit to the RedWing Beckman boots? Or maybe an Easton boot? I love the look on the Wolverines but have never been fitted for them.
frugalmalefashion,37glji,Montauksunshine,2,Thu May 28 05:53:29 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I have experience with those shoes myself. For the Wolverines, you should size down 1/2 to 1 size down from your normal shoe size. From what I read, the Redwing Beckmans also size down 1/2 to 1. If that is the case, the fit should be similar!

frugalmalefashion,37glji,pocketfool,2,Fri May 29 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"The Sheer Jersey/Summer shirt is ""summery"" and looser than the shirt it's based on, AA's original shirt (which is just too thick for me, i wear sheer jersey one year round). Personally, I size up. I wear a size M in tri-blend but a Large in the Sheer Jersey. because I have broad shoulders and because I like these shirts a little looser. I think the AA photo's on their site are very accurate on their fit.  Tri-Blend won't shrink as much as it's not 100% cotton. More fitted than the sheer jersey.  I can get more/different shirts if people are actually interested."

As long as the shirt fits me, I really don't care, but I prefer shoulder darts to box pleats.

frugalmalefashion,37efyu,kboxny,1 point,Wed May 27 12:24:01 2015 UTC,My experience with uniqlo is that pieces have a 1-2 season life.  Edit: I rather like them as part of my 'work uniform'. Solid light colored dress shirts that I can wear to the office. Look good yet within how much I would spend for a shirt I wear from 9-5

Honestly I don't have an oxford from Uniqlo, but I have a number of their slim medium dress shirts, which all fit me well in the arms and chest.  Since it's a dress shirt, the midsection was tucked in, but it still fit adequately.  A small would never feel comfortable in the chest/shoulders.  But maybe their oxfords are different."
frugalmalefashion,37efyu,Furgz,1 point,Wed May 27 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe, I couldn't tell you because I've only had the oxfords and (regular fit) flannel tops from them. Also, people's bodies vary wildly so it's hard to give this sort of advice with total accuracy."

frugalmalefashion,37efyu,302w,1 point,Wed May 27 15:12:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. He is going to have a bigger chest than you and is going to require a larger size. If his %BF is low then his waist could be the same size as you meaning he has to take in the waist. Tucking in is not going to help.  Maybe his build is different so we cannot know...

Not sure if they'll be on sale soon but keep a lookout for sure. People often complain that they wrinkle an absurd amount but they're like any other linen and the fit is pretty good too. The fit isn't as slim as the slim OCBD (which it traditionally isn't a slim style) but it's still flattering and I like them a lot so far. Excited to wear them during the summer.

frugalmalefashion,37ee32,refinery,2,Wed May 27 02:11:57 2015 UTC,A tailor should be able to taper the leg opening to your liking as well. Communicate what you want with your tailor and you should be fine.
frugalmalefashion,37ee32,refinery,3,Wed May 27 02:18:45 2015 UTC,I've done hemming before and it seems to be pretty cheap. 10 bucks or under. Is that your experience as well?

They stain very easily for some reason (I have multiple with stains, yet none of my American Apparel Tees do), and the collar on all of them has folded over and just looks bad. The fit is really big around the torso compared to AA, and I think the fabric is super low tension because they stretch really easily.

You re right though, so people want fashion without any thought to quality, price, or craftsmanship.

frugalmalefashion,378ufm,yanks123,29,Mon May 25 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Henleys, tees, chinos, and jeans have been added to the sale!  I was actually typing up a post also, so here it is:  LINK  Here is a link to a post by Mauro, the designer, on Styleforum regarding the details. A summary of the details are the following:   Sale items are final. There will be no combining orders to reduce shipping costs, so take your time.  Size charts will be provided; please pay attention to them. Chambrays and newer Overdye Oxfords run large. Chambrays SHOULD shrink to the tagged size, but order one size down on the newer Overdye Oxfords. Just read the descriptions. Before Dinner = slim fit, After Dinner = regular fit, Monkey Arms = tall fit, Picnic = short sleeves. Discount codes are not valid for sale items. Additional items will be added throughout the week. Not all items are in the sale section, so look around on the site. At the moment of this post, the winter accessories have not been placed in the sale section, but are on clearance.   I actually just started getting into the brand, all because of a FMF post like this one. After picking up a shirt from their last sale, I was very impressed by their products. Shortly after, I decided to join their rewards program. The quality and construction goes well beyond the price tag. WvG has quickly become one of my favorite brands and the rewards program has paid for itself multiple times over in the past couple months.   The shirts typically feature mother of pearl buttons, very nice fabrics, interesting prints, nice collar rolls on the button downs, unfused collars, single side seam stitching, and high stitch count amoung other details. With the overdyes at $20, that's Uniqlo prices for a higher quality product. I've also tried the shorts, which feel incredibly soft. I'm sure the rest of WvG's products show equally high hallmarks of quality. I highly suggest picking something up from the sale and seeing if the brand impresses you for yourself. If so, the rewards membership is a no brainer. Also, remember to sign up for their newsletters for the occasional discount codes."
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,figwitfan,6,Mon May 25 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"there seem to be a couple more items that are hidden, like chambrays. I think you can find most of them through this link  Seems to be a different subset of sale items. A couple of items are ""listed"" originally at $20-35 (without the red strikethrough text). Not sure if they are supposed to be there but my shopping cart passed through and I got the confirmation order email."
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,Pandamoniumtofu,3,Mon May 25 23:53:11 2015 UTC,Can you compare their fits to fits of another more mainstream brand? (J Crew for example?)
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,dnugget1,5,Mon May 25 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"The size charts are accurate for how the shirts fit. I've only tried XS before dinner shirts and they fit as slim as uniqlo slims, but are a little shorter in length. Haven't tried any J Crew shirts."

frugalmalefashion,378ufm,Aerimorla,2,Mon May 25 21:58:50 2015 UTC,How do the WvG OCBD smalls fit compared to Uniqlo OCBD smalls?
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,PinkTip,2,Mon May 25 21:39:53 2015 UTC,I'd say the small slim before dinner fit is like uniqlo slim small or xs regular. You can compare measurements but the darts mean that it does seem slimmer than the measurements say.  if you're talking about overdyes i have no idea though
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,lurkey_lurkey,2,Mon May 25 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"Oh shit I ordered the small overdyes without reading this. The particular color (circus peanut) I had didn't warn me about it running larger, and looking at the other colors now they warn the customers about it. Do you think there is a way I can cancel this order?"
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,PinkTip,3,Mon May 25 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't panic. If the particular overdye you ordered doesn't warn about a larger size then it isn't a size larger. The sale has overdyes from different seasons. So if the one you ordered doesn't specificially say to size up, then you'll be right for sizing."
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,liurobs,2,Mon May 25 22:58:43 2015 UTC,Thank you.

frugalmalefashion,378ufm,HipposLoveCereal,2,Mon May 25 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"I own a WvG OCBD (before-dinner fit, which means it has darts vs the non-darted after-dinner fit) and multiple Uniqlo slim fit OCBD.  Both are sized small. The WvG OCBD is definitely bigger in all dimensions when measured, but not by much. I would say the WvG OCBD is closer to the modern fit oxford from Gap. It has high arm holes which I like, but the color is fantastic and hasn't faded one bit. It is a bit bigger in the chest, same waist, about an inch longer about 1/2 inch longer sleeves (comparing to the slim fit Uniqlo OCBD).  The fabric on the WvG OCBD is much thicker than the Gap or Uniqlo OCBDs (thinnest to thickest: Uniqlo, Gap, WvG). The mother of pearl buttons on the WvG is very nice, but unfortunately after just 6 weeks of owning, the cuff button fell off on the WvG. Easy fix, but for a shirt that retails ~$200, very disappointing."
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,Citizen_V,2,Tue May 26 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"If you shoot WvG an email, they send out replacement mother of pearl buttons.  I've had some chip and break and got sent some no problem."

Would you say this statement from an old thread is false then?   an off the rack cut that's slim enough for a 10"" drop   It doesn't sound like it has a large drop. It doesn't look like it does from their pictures either."
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,Citizen_V,2,Tue May 26 10:55:03 2015 UTC,"I own 2 WvG OCBDs in Small Before-Dinner, an overdye from last year and one of the new 80s 2-ply.

frugalmalefashion,378ufm,liurobs,2,Tue May 26 02:46:37 2015 UTC,the chambray looks nice. hmmmm....
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,figwitfan,3,Tue May 26 02:38:20 2015 UTC,"Fair warning, those sewed up large if I recall correctly. Check the size charts, you may need to size down."
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,-mattybatty-,2,Tue May 26 05:39:34 2015 UTC,"They are larger to account for shrinking. I have the #2 chambray in xs. After I washed and tossed it in the dryer, it fit almost exactly like an xs bd. I'd say it fits slightly fuller in the chest/seat than a before dinner fit in the typical size, but I really like how it fits for a chambray.  Also, it is only the chambrays #2-#6 that have this different sizing. The other chambray items should be completely true to size."

frugalmalefashion,378ufm,figwitfan,2,Tue May 26 00:32:01 2015 UTC,Super soft. Like really damn soft.  But they fit weird. At least on me. Real snug on your crotch. Real low on the butt.  I personally wouldn't buy them again mainly because I have a larger hip area and these underwear don't fit me too well but if they do then by all means snag them.
frugalmalefashion,378ufm,xKronicL,2,Tue May 26 01:52:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that they are very soft. They fit pretty spot on too (makes my butt look great fyi). I typically wear Uniqlo airism boxer briefs, and these are a good way to mix things up with a cotton feel (although they are actually 60% bamboo, 40% sorona) as opposed to the airism synthetic feel.   Also, here is the boxer brief sizing by pants size:  XS 27-29  Small 29-31  Med 32-34  Large 34-36  XL 38-40  I wear pants size 30 and small fits great."

I more so meant that these kinds of clothes are artistic in a way that required planning, thought, and interpretation of trends.

frugalmalefashion,374otc,rosewood_gm,7,Mon May 25 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"Thus is actually standard operating procedure and apparel companies sell blanks for this express purpose.  Most blank companies actually sell shirts with easy to remove tags because what brand you use can be seen as kinda-sorta proprietary.  The pricing is average for what it is, maybe a touch high, but they may discount then more often. AA are more expensive than most blanks (Alternative Apparel are more expensive).  No company that prints shirts makes their own except, perhaps, mega companies like JC Penny, et al.  What would make you feel better about them? If they left the AA tags on? Then you would have two, maybe three tags: the AA label, the fiber content and RN # (required by law), and the company tag (sometimes printed)."
frugalmalefashion,374otc,akaghi,1 point,Mon May 25 01:33:19 2015 UTC,"That's actually exactly what most screen printing companies do.  I mean, sometimes it's cheaper brands of shirts.  Sometimes they leave bits of the tags on.  Shirt.woot went through that phase.  Eventually, they got big enough that it was more efficient to cut out the middleman and make their own shirts.  But anyone selling less than X T-shirts (where X is some unknown number that a lot of T-Shirt company accountants have calculated) is better off doing that.  What you really want is to know how to purchase very small orders of AA blanks at the same price as the smallest-volume silkscreeners.  FMF can actually help with that, too - search around."

frugalmalefashion,3739po,Flexappeal,1 point,Thu May 28 13:10:17 2015 UTC,Do you keep shoe trees in them?  I would think that if they were THAT snug that shoes trees might help to stretch the toe box.  I had a really snug toe box on a pair of allen edmonds that I bought and never really figured out a good way to stretch it out.  A shoe tree wouldn't fit all the way into the toe box and I tried stuffing socks into the toe box as well as some other remedies that I read about online.

Will have to be comfortable and durable-- I walk about 4 miles a day on city streets. This would be replacing a pair of Allen Edmonds that are getting absolutely shredded by my daily walk.  Any suggestions?"
frugalmalefashion,373b9l,ScapegoatZovc,3,Tue May 26 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Hey /r/frugalmalefashion,  I'm looking to get some new basics for my wardrobe to help me make it through the summer here in Louisiana. I'd rather stick to the lower-end of the price spectrum but I'd also like to buy items that will last until I decide whether or not they're a staple of my wardrobe. (At which point I'd probably replace them with higher-end stuff.)  I'm fairly thin, and allegedly  that means deeper-necked shirts will look nice as they'll show off more of my defined/visible collar bones. I'd like to try out some scoop neck or deeper V-necked shirts. Hopefully I could get a white, heather-gray, and maybe a ""summer colored"" one.  Also considering that I'm a thin dude, I'd like to get a functional rain jacket. It's hot and humid here (90+ F and 60%+ humidity on days it doesn't rain), so the jacket needs to be as breathable as possible. I don't mind spending a pretty penny here, but I'd like for the jacket to fit me nicely rather than billow all around. I'm tempted to get a bright yellow and go for the classic rainwear look, but I'm also interested in perhaps a bright red as well. I like the idea of my rainwear standing out and not really sweating it because it's a functional article of clothing. (Most of my clothes are pretty tame colors.)  Also in the market for sandals. Birkenstocks are tempting, but so are less conservative and tech-y sandals that reach for the ""fashionably dorky"" genre. I wear a 10.5 in US (M) sizes, and would consider getting a conservative pair like Birks and a sillier pair like a more outstanding Teva.  Finally, some thought is being given to a short-sleeve button down or two. I'm really trying to avoid the fight of bringing more shirts to the tailor, but if you sell me on a shirt I might consider it. No real preference on whether or not it's patterned or solid, just a metter of whether or not it catches my eye and seems suitable for the climate.  Rundown:   Scoop Neck or maybe Deep V-Neck shirts. (prefer ~$20 ea. tops) Functional, breathable rain jacket (prefer ~$100, can spend more.) Sandals. (Prefer ~$80 ea., can spend more.) Short-sleeve button-down. (No price preference, only sort of considering getting one or two.)"

The construction is obviously pretty cheap but I throw this shit around 24/7 and it hasn't torn but some of the material on the bottom has frayed.

frugalmalefashion,373b9l,KnightNight-,1 point,Tue May 26 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Hey FMF,  I'm in the market for both a new pair of casual sneakers, and some ankle-boots to act as a crossover between work (business casual) and a night out.  I used to own a very comfortable pair of Ankle Boots that I loved and wore almost daily. The problem is that the heel came unglued due to poor quality after only 4 months of regular wear. I took them to a local cobbler and he did what he could, but the quality of the shoe made them practically unsalvageable.  I loved those boots. They looked decent enough on me, and were probably the comfiest non-slipper I've ever worn.  The problem I have is that I have no idea how to tell what kind of quality a shoe is going to be without buying it and wearing it, or paying a ridiculous amount for the pair (and even that's not a guarantee!).  So I have a few questions:     What are some things to look for in a shoe that will tell you if it's high or low quality? Are there any reputable sneaker brands that don't cost an arm & a leg?   I used to buy a lot of DC shoes when I was younger, and they seemed to last a long time. But I'm not sure where to find them these days, or if they're even made with the same quality they used to be.  Same question, but for boots/ankle boots instead.   Something like this, or even this is more to my liking.  If I'm wearing a shoe every day, and walking between 6,000-8,000 steps in it, about how long should it be lasting? What's the standard ""price range"" for something like a casual sneaker?    I've bought $10 walmart sneakers before as emergencies on vacation, but they were worn through within a week. But I've also paid $80 for a nicer pair of sneakers that were dead in under a month as well. I don't think I'm particularly hard on shoes, I just have no idea what makes a ""quality"" shoe outside of gambling on a high price tag."

I can get one for 170 before tax right now and I know the photographer line from Express fits me off the rack. Would that be paying too much?

frugalmalefashion,372lx6,ARedHouseOverYonder,2,Tue May 26 04:28:31 2015 UTC,I was looking for the Jannsson at a good price after seeing The Gambler.

frugalmalefashion,372lx6,ARedHouseOverYonder,2,Tue May 26 04:54:05 2015 UTC,When you say polychromatic do you mean photochromic?  I'm not familiar with the term you used. I honestly didn't pay attention to the lenses because I figured for the price they were protective as far as UV and I have quite a few pairs of shades which are polarized already if I'm doing anything that would be better with polarized lenses. I liked the style and that was enough in this case. Could you explain the polychromatic thing to me?
frugalmalefashion,372lx6,Bradhan,1 point,Tue May 26 05:31:57 2015 UTC,"yeah i meant photochromic, i was on mobile and it got autoincorrected. You are correct, I live somewhere that Polarized are vital because of the amount of rain and sun at the same time, so just having lenses that adjust per sun isnt enough for me generally."

A pair of Macys is not the same as A nordstroms or official site.  The reviews here are all saying pretty bad so I'd save the money personally but that's my opinion.  What the shoe economic theory and all that.
frugalmalefashion,36zeee,wayfarerextreme,2,Sat May 23 17:02:03 2015 UTC,So a Macy's pair is worse than a Nordstrom's pair? Are they actually different?
frugalmalefashion,36zeee,Juhuatai,-1,Sat May 23 23:04:24 2015 UTC,Yes definitely. My macys pair doesnt even feel like leather.  Its thinner and cheaper in every way.  The laces were also green in the middle.   Now I got the classic brown from  macys and the sahara from nordstrom but I doubt the color would be the cause of such huge quality control.  Could be I just got a bad pair however Ive heard others having aimilar experiences as well.

frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,beardfish8,2,Sat May 23 03:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yep- was able to do that with a receipt, I believe. Might only be free for pants over 19.90 though"

frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,PulledPork_,8,Fri May 22 17:04:11 2015 UTC,I'm spoiled by the $1 socks they have during the Christmas holidays.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,BpooSoc,1 point,Fri May 22 17:20:21 2015 UTC,I often wonder why I didn't order more of those.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Dunda,4,Fri May 22 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"Freaking awesome, I love these for really hot weather. Too bad they didn't have the mesh on sale though, I kind of like those better. Snagged another grey and trying a beige out."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Micrafone_AssAssin,2,Fri May 22 20:07:26 2015 UTC,hows the sizing on these? I heard they might run a little snug? Shoudl I size up?
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,ieatfrosties,2,Fri May 22 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"They stretch a ton, I would advise AGAINST sizing up, because you don't want the sleeves to stick out.  I wear a large in airism and an XL in everything else Uniqlo.  They are just so stretchy it doesn't feel constricting."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Die-In-A-Fire,4,Fri May 22 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"I stayed true to size because it's an undershirt and you want it to be well fitting. Or I do at least. The shoulder seams lands right where it should and the length is also enough to stay tucked in all day.   If you wear more relaxed fitting clothes you could probably go for a size up. Maybe get one of each and see how you like the fit, and return the other? 8 dollars is a great price for these.   For reference I am 6 foot, 180 lbs, and have a 40.5"" chest measurement. I stuck with a medium for these and even after a cold wash (no dry for these) that caused some minimal shrinking, they fit well."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Micrafone_AssAssin,2,Fri May 22 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"I went TTS as well and it fit well. Shoulders are perfect, sleeves a bit tight, body is long and drapey. Extremely comfortable for an undershirt.  If I wanted a snug fit, I might have been able to get away with sizing down but I worry about the shoulders and sleeves. The material is stretchy though."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Citizen_V,2,Sat May 23 05:14:59 2015 UTC,What is the difference between mesh and non-mesh AIRism?
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Fandemonium,2,Fri May 22 16:54:00 2015 UTC,It has a waffled texture to it.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Monkeychow67,2,Fri May 22 16:56:08 2015 UTC,Both just as light?
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Fandemonium,2,Fri May 22 20:52:46 2015 UTC,The mesh one is maybe a little lighter. I like them both.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,ddog510,1 point,Fri May 22 17:02:10 2015 UTC,"Mesh and non mesh are both just as light, breathable, cool, etc. The non-mesh feels softer, while the mesh feels slightly more rugged, but not really that much. It looks pretty cool, and is ultra comfy as well. They both pretty much feel the same."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,mysoju1,2,Fri May 22 17:26:34 2015 UTC,I have a white mesh v-neck. Nipple party. Undershirt.

frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,follrurarond,1 point,Fri May 22 18:33:20 2015 UTC,I bought some airism undershirts & a linen shirt.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Dilbert_reloaded,1 point,Fri May 22 21:48:23 2015 UTC,I just bought two linen shirts last week.  I really like them and I'll be sad to see them get put away in the fall.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,funkyb,1 point,Sat May 23 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have from Uniqlo from is pretty much their Dry Packaged shirts. How would you say they fit compared to those?  Also, did you get short or long linens?"
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,bosoxdanc,1 point,Fri May 22 22:22:45 2015 UTC,These are the first things I've bought from them so unfortunately I can't compare them :(  And I got long sleeve linens.  Short sleeve button downs always look odd to me (though paradoxically I often roll up the sleeves on my button downs)
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,funkyb,1 point,Sat May 23 02:21:53 2015 UTC,Uniqlo seriously needs to start shipping to Canada
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Empereur_Nabroleon,1 point,Sat May 23 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"I think AIRism is similar to a Costco breathable undershirt that I bought for $4.99.  Anyways, I bought one and will do a comparison."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Hash-Basher,1 point,Sun May 24 04:28:41 2015 UTC,Do Airism shirts shrink in the wash?
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,SelvedgeLeopard,2,Fri May 22 23:41:49 2015 UTC,There's minimal shrinkage when washed in cold water and line dried.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,Citizen_V,2,Sat May 23 02:22:54 2015 UTC,thanks for the heads up.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,SelvedgeLeopard,1 point,Sat May 23 06:32:15 2015 UTC,I just made a purchase yesterday. Do you think I could get a refund on the shipping ?
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,moewwe12,5,Sat May 23 10:55:38 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat.  I called customer service, they said they couldn't give me a price adjustment.  My order was still in pending status so I cancelled the order with them on the phone and re-ordered online today with free shipping.    Kind of silly, but they said can't do price adjustments due to system limitations.  Kinda really fucking silly, but still no big deal."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,MarcGunt,2,Sat May 23 04:43:02 2015 UTC,I might do the same.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,moewwe12,1 point,Sat May 23 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is system limitations. To get their clothes to such a low price they have to compromise somewhere, and it's in customer service. They don't allow adjustments for policy reasons."

frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,srathi,1 point,Fri May 22 16:34:22 2015 UTC,Get it hemmed. Free in store (if the pants are over 19.90) or you have to take it a tailor.

Probably depends on your preference for fit, though."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,bamgrinus,1 point,Fri May 22 16:47:02 2015 UTC,I bought small linen and medium polo (not MB). both fit really well.

frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,funkyb,0,Fri May 22 17:36:01 2015 UTC,I have a S in OCBD and S in Linen and the Linen definitely fits a little larger.
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,yoshimania00,2,Fri May 22 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"Although it's supposed to fit loosely, they need to make a slim fit version for slim men.  I can't even wear a slim in their OCBD's, but their linen shirts are still too loose on me."
frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,rogun64,-1,Mon May 25 02:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say that a linen S = an OCBD slim M.  Size down if you normally wear a slim OCBD, but TTS if you wear a regular."

frugalmalefashion,36vzdo,allforthekarma,1 point,Fri May 22 21:20:58 2015 UTC,The measurements seemed to confirm that (although the OCBD I was measuring to compare is several seasons old so the fit may be different now).

frugalmalefashion,36t2a7,TSOD,2,Fri May 22 03:28:12 2015 UTC,They buy old gift cards at a fraction of the price then sell them a little higher and keep the profit. They're pretty much the Gamestop of gift cards.

frugalmalefashion,36t2a7,canopey,2,Fri May 22 16:26:35 2015 UTC,I bought something similar a few months ago. The fit is off either too tight or too baggy depending on what size you are. On mines the crouch area dips down a lot lower than I like them to be. I'm a 30 I tired both the Sm and med. and settled for the medium.

frugalmalefashion,36qz18,go_lobos,10,Thu May 21 22:05:31 2015 UTC,BR shoes are worthless. Spend the money elsewhere on something that will last.

frugalmalefashion,36qz18,notevenanorphan,2,Thu May 21 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"They have a pretty nice look to them compared to something you'd find at DSW/Nordstrom Rack, but you'll be disappointed if you've looked at something like Allen Edmonds recently.  In my experience (3 pairs) they're disposable shoes. The sole will wear out on you in a few months, and the uppers won't be in good enough shape to consider resoling. During a significant sale, the price is about right for what you're getting."

frugalmalefashion,36qz18,YellowPowerNinja9420,2,Thu May 21 19:49:17 2015 UTC,They don't. But the Aidens are pretty nice and slim if you ask me. ~9 in inseam so they usually are 1-2 inches above your knees when standing and about 2-4 inches above while sitting. If you have somewhat average sized thighs then they will be a nice slim fit.
frugalmalefashion,36qz18,eenad,3,Thu May 21 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"The 25% code is still working, however they are taking about 20 minutes to email them. Just use a personal account since the 10minute email is limited."

frugalmalefashion,36qz18,Dontblameme1,1 point,Thu May 21 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this has been asked before - how does the tailored slim fit match up against the slim fit? I ask because I have found my perfect size to be a uniqlo slim M. So when I ordered a shirt from the BR outlet I got the slim and not tailored slim. Its actually pretty baggy. So I was weary to get it again and I'm leaning towards tailored slim. I've heard the outlet is a different line - could that be the reason that slim wasn't that slim. I'm not that skinny either - I'm 5'11 170. Skinny but not a stick at all. I am hesitant about the tailored slim, but as tested by my BR outlet slim being baggy..."

frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,TexWonderwood,2,Thu May 21 20:15:06 2015 UTC,I don't understand how that would work?
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,elchismoso,17,Thu May 21 19:47:15 2015 UTC,"Right now it's 50% off, price as marked.  After the sale date ends, JCrew Factory will probably start a sale that is ""Extra x% off with code SOMETHING"". Normally, they would then change the prices back (since the 50% off ends), but there is always a small window of time before they change the prices when the discount code will already work, so you can stack both sales. Normally this window is like, one or two hours after the previous sale ends (which is midnight in some time zone, I don't know which)."
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,Dunda,2,Thu May 21 19:56:56 2015 UTC,Do these codes usually have any exclusions?
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,ABirdOfParadise,1 point,Fri May 22 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on, to us, luck of the draw.  Could be something stupid like 30% off new arrivals, or like 20% off shorts, sometimes it could be 30% off everything + additional 30% off clearance + free shipping.  Then you hammer it cause the price would be the yet unchanged 50% off everything + 30% off everything , and if on clearance then 30% off that.  If it's a shitty exclusion but you want something still then hey it's still 50% off everything. If it's a good one then bonus because it's like 65-75%. Of course you shouldn't be looking at  % off with all the price changes but things like lowest historical price (but you'd have to keep track on a semi frequent basis and be willing to wait)."
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,theStork,13,Sat May 23 02:16:02 2015 UTC,"At the end of the 50% off sale, they won't change the prices on the items until around 4 AM the next day.  JCF almost always follows up flat-rate sales with promo code sales for 20-30% off.  These promo codes are available at 12AM, so there is a 4 hour window where you can stack the new promo code and the previous 50% off sale.  All the best JCF deals have come from snagging things during that window."

frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,TSOD,1 point,Mon May 25 05:32:52 2015 UTC,So what day and time would I shop to get the best deal? Around midnight on the day that this sale ends? Or should I just be checking back here around midnight everyday for the new sale to stack them?
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,theStork,3,Thu May 21 20:21:17 2015 UTC,It's between midnight and ~4 AM EST the day after the sale ends - in this case it will be 12-4 AM on May 26th.
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,AshtonEV,1 point,Thu May 21 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Go on the website and check the details for the current sale. I'm pretty sure it ends at 12 at night the 25th. If you are on the west coast like me the sale pops up at 10 pm. About 4 hours later they ""fix"" the prices (raise them) giving you less of a deal. I've been looking at all the deals that they have put out, and this had the potential to be an amazing sale."

frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,Coolingritu,1 point,Thu May 21 20:52:42 2015 UTC,Essentially yes but you don't need to have everything in your card before midnight. You should just be planning on adding things before they make the change
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,jjutsu,0,Thu May 21 21:01:50 2015 UTC,Do you mean that I can have items added to my cart and ready before midnight? Also do you know how steep the extra discount is?
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,Coolingritu,1 point,Fri May 22 03:24:10 2015 UTC,Yes you can but make sure the prices reflect the discount. Sometimes it does update if its in your cart. My advice is choose what you want and add it shortly after midnight once the sale begins. Sometime the extra varies from 25% -40%
frugalmalefashion,36s5j7,jjutsu,1 point,Fri May 22 03:26:33 2015 UTC,Ah ok thank you.

I'll offer a tip of my own: place anything you might want in your wish list and check on it every so often. There are categories for ""Only a Few Left"" and ""Backordered"" so if something you really want falls in either of those, you may not want to wait for that 4 hour window to stack sales. As I'm sure you all know,  you can still order backordered items, but they do eventually stop taking orders for it."

frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,kingnook,1 point,Fri May 22 02:46:26 2015 UTC,Any coupons available on top of the sale?
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,eagle916,1 point,Fri May 22 21:14:29 2015 UTC,Not sure if a real deal buy I found  several slim straight salvage jeans in blue for 29
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,DerTagestrinker,1 point,Sat May 23 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"Can anyone comment on the Airism shirts? They seem kind of weird, but as a heavy sweater, any undershirt the could help would be awesome.  Also, the Philly store is quite minimalist-gaudy. Are all the Uniqlo stores like that one (super white with red highlights/escalator rails, etc)?"
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,bamgrinus,11,Thu May 21 14:51:47 2015 UTC,Best undershirts I know of. Cool to the touch and wick moisture very well. Deep V neck compared to a lot of other brands.
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,DerTagestrinker,1 point,Thu May 21 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. One other question, how's the sizing? If I wear a medium slim fit dress shirt from the Uniqlo, should I do a medium Airism? I usually wear small undershirts."
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,triguy616,1 point,Thu May 21 15:42:53 2015 UTC,Small
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,bamgrinus,1 point,Thu May 21 16:05:20 2015 UTC,They're pretty stretchy so you should be fine sizing down.
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,fishdontreddit,5,Thu May 21 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds exactly like the NYC store on 34th, so I'd say yes."
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,DerTagestrinker,6,Thu May 21 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm not sure what's more weird, the Uniqlo store that has the aesthetics of a GBA Pokecenter, or the Urban Outfitters which is like an urban Ewok village."
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,Juhuatai,4,Thu May 21 15:44:26 2015 UTC,Ewok village is definitely weirder. The Uniqlo stores have a modern/minimalist feel to them.
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,Durendana,1 point,Thu May 21 20:57:32 2015 UTC,Ewok village.
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,Tkachenko,3,Thu May 21 15:48:04 2015 UTC,I go to the one in Willow Grove and KOP and they're pretty much the same

frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,Coopak,1 point,Thu May 21 15:07:48 2015 UTC,I've never seen one in person--what makes them weird?
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,eddrix,2,Thu May 21 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"the material is an undergarment material like the kind of stuff bras are made of (not the fancy lacey kind), I dont know how to describe it exactly and the shirts are very long."
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,jdmercredi,1 point,Thu May 21 21:11:19 2015 UTC,I understood this as meaning you were a heavy sweater like one that Hemingway might wear.
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,DerTagestrinker,1 point,Thu May 21 22:04:12 2015 UTC,I wish I could rock the sweater like Papa.
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,kimchibear,1 point,Fri May 22 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"Solid undershirts and workout shirts. The heathered blue crew shirt one I can get away with as a casual shirt. The white, black, or grey are shiny and would be strictly undershirt, workout gear, or IDGAF days."
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,Indaleciox,1 point,Thu May 21 22:09:27 2015 UTC,I love em. Time for me to stock up!
frugalmalefashion,36rcy3,Citizen_V,0,Thu May 21 23:18:34 2015 UTC,The beige V-necks are amazing if it's relatively close to your skin color. I wish I ordered more when they were on sale.
frugalmalefashion,36ti3j,TexWonderwood,1 point,Fri May 22 00:08:51 2015 UTC,Anyone have experience with their skinny chino shorts?
frugalmalefashion,36ti3j,AshtonEV,1 point,Fri May 22 02:02:49 2015 UTC,It's a good slim fit. They're my go-to. I'm a 27-28 but the 26 fits fine.

frugalmalefashion,36un0k,rogun64,1 point,Tue May 26 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"I recently paid $44 and $38 for a couple of pairs of men's Z/1's from STP.  Those figures include tax and S&H.  Not that $47 isn't a great deal, but I was noting that there have been better ones.  Btw, their Z/1 for young men is actually for men, because Chaco doesn't sell them for young men in those sizes.  Mine were both men's, but I'm telling you this because the young men's are a usually a little less money."
