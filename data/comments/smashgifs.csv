smashgifs,3e2ljy,sprish,14,Tue Jul 21 13:58:33 2015 UTC,Today on /r/smashgifs: Leffen getting rekt by everyone.
smashgifs,3e2ljy,BlueBackedRobin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:18 2015 UTC,You gotta love it.
smashgifs,3e2ljy,_Sonicman_,2,Tue Jul 21 19:46:06 2015 UTC,Did he edge-cancel that thunder?
smashgifs,3e2ljy,87linux,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:13 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure thunder doesn't need to be edge cancelled because the move itself doesn't move Pikachu. I could be wrong though.
smashgifs,3e2lb7,sprish,4,Tue Jul 21 13:56:28 2015 UTC,Plup is a master baiter
smashgifs,3e2lb7,ChopS2E,7,Tue Jul 21 18:24:26 2015 UTC,That smug look on Plups face when he knows he got it
smashgifs,3e2lb7,gneiss_try,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:14 2015 UTC,Couldn't Leffen recover if he didn't laser? Or did he think Plup would've killed him anyway?
smashgifs,3e2lb7,justaquicki,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:31 2015 UTC,I think he was close enough to get the ledge but knows plup will get it easily and just wants that extra 1%
smashgifs,3e2lb7,qwertycanary,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:43 2015 UTC,That was the best game of all Evo.
smashgifs,3e2lb7,nikovan_smash,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:06 2015 UTC,Plup's Samus is poetry.

smashgifs,3dznse,ubiquitous_username,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah he definitely had a rougher time of it at EVO. Definitely had some great moments against Armada and Hbox though, just was never quite enough."

This is where OP got the title, implying that when Captain Falcon uses his knee, women (Zelda) appear."

smashgifs,3e10g5,Ollehkiin,4,Tue Jul 21 04:22:02 2015 UTC,His recent tweets looked like he's going to take a break and get the insomnia figured out before making a return. Really glad he's putting health first

smashgifs,3dy80f,Charizarlslie,15,Mon Jul 20 15:29:39 2015 UTC,Is it normal for people to hold the control stick like plup does?
smashgifs,3dy80f,oogaboogacaveman,23,Mon Jul 20 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"haha, you should see how Javi holds the controller."
smashgifs,3dy80f,JPern721,9,Mon Jul 20 17:24:40 2015 UTC,Is he using his index finger to move the control stick?
smashgifs,3dy80f,discforhire,12,Mon Jul 20 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of using your thumb and index finger, it allows for very precise analog inputs"

Maybe I'm overestimating its importance, but I'd rather start now than get used to playing one way and then having to adjust later if I get to be any good"
smashgifs,3dy80f,oogaboogacaveman,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"I also main Luigi, I just use my thumb. Max distance WDs aren't that hard once you get it. If using your thumb and index doesn't feel comfortable then I don't really see a point"
smashgifs,3dy80f,SockBasket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:30 2015 UTC,"yeah it probably doesn't make a huge difference. I Was more talking about being able to control if I was doing a short, medium, or long distance wavedash"

smashgifs,3dy80f,sinapzwork,3,Mon Jul 20 17:52:30 2015 UTC,I love how much Samus play there was at EVO. I didnt see it coming and Samus is so fun to watch.

smashgifs,3dy80f,honeybadger2012,3,Tue Jul 21 02:42:24 2015 UTC,I fucking screamed when I saw this live
smashgifs,3dy80f,SHINX_FUCKER,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"Samus is legitimately one of my least favorite characters to play and watch, but the first two stocks of this set were the hypest thing at Evo. Destruction."

smashgifs,3dz363,TwasARockLobsta,14,Mon Jul 20 19:41:27 2015 UTC,I don't think horizontal drift affects vertical acceleration...
smashgifs,3dz363,kyu_puff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"No, but he still could have went for the corner. Would it have made a difference? I'unno."
smashgifs,3dz363,Flash_Johnson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:03 2015 UTC,He couldn't have gone for the corner.   There's a long time where you can't change direction after you hit a rollout from the air.
smashgifs,3dz363,InternetSam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:14 2015 UTC,It wouldn't have.
smashgifs,3dz363,Luhmies,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"DI allows you to shift your trajectory by modifying horizontal and vertical components; its magnitude remains constant.   Survival DI is the practice of modifying the horizontal and vertical components to maximize magnitude length before meeting a blast zone, i.e. aiming towards the corner.  Drifting only allows you to modify your movement's horizontal component. Drifting left or right will have no effect on how quickly your character will fall; the speed at which you approach the bottom blast zone would remain constant."

smashgifs,3dwkrk,ahampster,21,Mon Jul 20 03:20:16 2015 UTC,Easily one of the hypest sets of EVO. The secondary stream even stopped playing their match so people could watch.
smashgifs,3dwkrk,tvdinner4me,10,Mon Jul 20 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"So hype! Also, what's up with that hand sign that guy kept doing on stream?"

smashgifs,3dwkrk,Dapplegonger,10,Mon Jul 20 03:27:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was doing the hand sign to mean ""3VO""  rip"
smashgifs,3dwkrk,Hussler,8,Mon Jul 20 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"Didn't even get hyped up with the rest of the crowd. Adding that to the obnoxious hand signal, he doesn't deserve to be that close to the stream setup imo"

Basically what happened was that I turned it on, but then it desynched. When I went back to an earlier point in time, I forgot that I hadn't turned on then. By the time I realized that was the case I had already put in about 5/6 hours into the TAS and I didn't want to scrap that much work."

Marth is barely any different between the two games, and GnW is just 10x worse with the exact same kit in melee.

smashgifs,3d4fp2,Smaggles_,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"I agree in every sense, except that gnw is worse in PM. I've taken quite a few games off of my friends using gnw against a slew of different characters."

smashgifs,3d4fp2,reese_ridley,7,Tue Jul 14 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"Marth isn't an instigator, he has a hard time outright forcing situations and has to rely (and premeditate b/c his moves are SLOW) on covering the most/most likely options to come ahead in a situation.  He relies on having a very consistent and optimal punish game to get ahead in a match.  A Marth player needs matchup knowledge to get reads and baits, especially against a player that knows when to respect and punish a Marth.  So low teirs can do a few things to Marth's that don't know the matchups: nerfed marth punish/combo game, incorrect reads from marth, and depending on the character they can punish marth stuff that is often done against a high tier.  This rings true for most high tier low tier matchups, but I feel like fox, falco and sheik just have easier punishes and rely on a fundamentally different edgeguarding game."

smashgifs,3cwa9e,ycz6,2,Sat Jul 11 08:45:09 2015 UTC,"Click the title for full-speed playback!  Explanation:   This clip involves two really difficult techniques done back to back.   The first is the aerial interrupt, in which doing certain aerials with very precise timings will cause your character to ""teleport"" to a platform above it because of hitbox deformation.  The second is the shield drop, in which pressing the control down a very specific amount while shielding will cause you to drop through a platform, rather than spotdodging or just angling your shield.  There is a bomb jump in between iterations of these two techniques. As a whole, this loop is stupid hard and not at all effective as shield pressure, making it more or less useless. Still, I'd like to see someone do this at full speed."
smashgifs,3cwa9e,RathKeno,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:51:00 2015 UTC,I could see it being useful as a way of jumping up to a platform. It's probably not good when used repeatedly like this though.

I think it comes down to personality, and just plain circumstances. Perhaps some people dont have the time and resources to dedicate themselves to melee. Maybe someone just wants a game more heavily emphasized on the neutral.  Take me for example (this might be biased).  I play both games under different circumstances. Melee is a great game and the amount of options it gives for movement, approach an just plain combos is a godsend. When i play sm4sh, it really challenges the fundamentals I learned in melee and makes me apply them differently ways i never thought of before since its a game that relies solely on fundamentals while not interfering with melee since Smash4 is such a straightforward game."

smashgifs,3c63xh,MegaAmoonguss,23,Sun Jul 5 04:37:22 2015 UTC,how would you have recovered? that seems about what you could do...
smashgifs,3c63xh,pennypinball,21,Sun Jul 5 04:46:45 2015 UTC,I mean I guess it's predictable in the sense that the Falco has no  other options after they lose their jump?
smashgifs,3c63xh,Fez_Master,2,Sun Jul 5 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"At the time that I performed this, I thought that he had 2 options. 1. Go to the height of the ledge/barely onto the stage, which he did and I predicted as he did that many other times while I was playing him. 2. Go high up and either side-B to the stage or up-B to the ledge. However, looking at this again, he may have been in hitstun all the way until he jumped, in which case he really did only have one option..."
smashgifs,3c63xh,Zoler,2,Sun Jul 5 05:27:22 2015 UTC,He could've jumped and airdodged onto the stage.

smashgifs,3c63xh,pennypinball,0,Sun Jul 5 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, i guess, but that's a pretty difficult reaction for most people"
smashgifs,3c63xh,ewd444,11,Sun Jul 5 17:30:54 2015 UTC,You shouldn't react to that kinda stuff you should just assume it's gonna happen.

smashgifs,3c63xh,kkjdroid,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:23:31 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
smashgifs,3c63xh,godsconscious,8,Mon Jul 6 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"no that was just solid edgeguarding. youre MK, edgeguarding isnt exactly difficult against a spacie."
smashgifs,3c63xh,godsconscious,-2,Sun Jul 5 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"If you can read how high they're gonna go, it's pretty free, but if not then you just sort of miss out on it. It gets pretty easy to read most people after playing with them for a bit though."
smashgifs,3c63xh,Mallow-kun,2,Mon Jul 6 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"its easier because MK has the tools to shut down their recovery. side b to the ledge -> MK can Cape or side b to the ledge from the stage, or just edgeguard with dtilt. firefox angled upward -> MK has the jumps and good up air range to cover a missed platform cancel by the fox/falco. if youre not looking for a combo, MK can use any of his specials (unlikely shuttle will work tho) to get to that spacie.   on top of edgeguarding from the stage, MK can grab the ledge and nair to ruin sweet spot attempts. He also ruins attempts to recover close to the stage, especially with his quick speed which he can use to dash up from the ledge. hes got great tools, reading the recovery with MK is not a major component. good reaction time is probably better."

smashgifs,3bw1rq,imbielby,22,Thu Jul 2 20:35:06 2015 UTC,How did that happen?
smashgifs,3bw1rq,brandy606,26,Thu Jul 2 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"when you press shield yoshi contorts his hurt box to fit inside the egg but before hes fully in the egg the parts of his body hurt box that are sticking out become invincible. invincible is the state you are in when you respawn, when an opponent hits you they suffer hitlag but you don't. if you slow it down you can see how pichu is sorta frozen in air because of hitlag but yoshi is able to act out of the parry right away."
smashgifs,3bw1rq,felyneslavetrade,5,Fri Jul 3 05:49:33 2015 UTC,"To add on to what /u/felyneslavetrade said, the egg actually just comes out on one frame. His entire body is invincible.  And it's not as simple as just attacking out of it. Yoshi's shield is unique because you can't jump out of it. However, in the couple of frames before the shield comes out, you can jump out of it, leaving you free to do jump cancel grab, wavedash, aerial, double jump on first frame in the air to just land on the ground, or jump cancel up smash, what aMSa did here."
smashgifs,3bw1rq,Dapplegonger,5,Thu Jul 2 18:04:47 2015 UTC,The reason it was so distinct this time though is because the high damage=high hitlag
smashgifs,3bw1rq,TheChocolateLava,9,Thu Jul 2 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"Parrying works, in part, because yoshi isn't affected by shield hitlag."

smashgifs,3bw1rq,Dapplegonger,5,Thu Jul 2 18:26:47 2015 UTC,But his shield is affected by hitlag. That's not the reason for what was happening. Just his pre-shield physics are very different than his shield physics.
smashgifs,3bw1rq,TheChocolateLava,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right. It's the pre-shield animation that allows parrying."

smashgifs,3bjgrz,pianodan,7,Mon Jun 29 18:53:11 2015 UTC,How do you cancel the focus punch like that?
smashgifs,3bjgrz,tamatsu,7,Tue Jun 30 05:44:06 2015 UTC,You can double tap forward to cancel the focus punch. This means that you can take a hit without knockback and then cancel the focus punch to lead into a counterattack or a landing option.

smashgifs,3bhk72,SchofieldSilver,-9,Tue Jun 30 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"Posted this a few different places and the best comment I got was ""nice off-stage Thunder"". That was the easiest, least skillful, least necessary part!   It starts out with a grab. I am Pikachu. I throw Lucina upwards for a Thunder. Simple enough, every Pika player knows this combo. Then I combo directly into a forward aerial, but I fast-fall it and pull out before the final hit comes in. I did this on purpose to ""spike"" Lucina down for a followup on the ground. Then, before I land, I cross over Lucina's head to land behind them so that they cannot easily punish me, especially with a quick grab or jab before my Thunder comes out... and I drop a Thunder just as they try to use Counter themselves as a combobreaker. They miss the timing on their Counter because they didn't expect a slow Thunder, they get knocked away, and I chase after them. I unleash a Thunder Jolt to cover my approach, and this Thunder Jolt cancels their charging Sheildbreaker just before I'm about to get hit by it, leaving them open to punishment from my forward smash. I was able to run up and forward smash my opponent for free because Thunder Jolt is just that amazing. They were already basically dead from the forward smash when I jumped offstage to try to edgeguard, but I decided to drop a Thunder on them at the last second anyway because I had already hurled myself off the edge at them and didn't feel like trying to get back.   full match is mostly uninteresting and has various types of bad play from either side but if you wanna see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuFrwaWG2z8"
smashgifs,3bhk72,chrisp_,7,Mon Jun 29 07:31:29 2015 UTC,"/u/jugglingguitars is right. Pikachu smash attacks a third of the stage away, Lucina tries and fails to whiff punish with a full jump counter, more counter spam, wastes double jump, expects Pikachu to run into a freaking shieldbreaker, and the only non-special she uses is offstage when she's already dead. The crossup and thunderjolt fsmash were nice but you can land anything on a scrub."

The very first hit of Roy's up-B has insane knockback, but you normally don't notice it because it links directly into the other hits of the move which have moderate/reasonable knockback. In this case, Roy snapping to the ledge cancelled the other hitboxes besides the very first one, which by itself was able to kill Sheik at 6%. Most multi-hit up-B's in the game have this property but the design is smart enough that you almost never see it do this."

That first hitbox is the strongest by design, but wouldn't kill in a non-edgeguard situation until 100-130% depending on weight, stage, etc. Executing that is just a matter of timing and technical precision. To take advantage of what the gyf shows you'd need to find another way to land the initial hitbox and cancel all the rest of them."
smashgifs,3b2yqb,not-Kid_Putin,2,Thu Jun 25 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically, maybe in teams after the first hit, a teammate (lets say falco shoots a laser) suddenly stopping the rest of the move so the first hit is all that connects... not practical but kinda cool"
smashgifs,3b2yqb,chaosscizzors,2,Thu Jun 25 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"really you could hit roy with anything. a jab, weak dash attack, turnip, etc. would be just fine, it's just the timing window is absurdly small. hell you could have a team of roys trying to jab one another while the other throws out upBs lol."

I was at really high percent so rage must've scaled and killed him. Retrying this in training mode didn't work, it seems rage is the main factor in getting roys upb to kill."

smashgifs,3a9z33,the_noodle,3,Thu Jun 18 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is how Armada crouches a lot, which looks like the beginning of a turnip pull, letting him sneak in turnips when they're not spaced well enough."

smashgifs,3a9z33,Smished,12,Thu Jun 18 15:12:35 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure even 2008-2010 Armada shielded/rolled often enough as well. Two famous Mango punishes that I can remember involve him shielding or shielding than rolling.

smashgifs,3a9z33,fxuxk,3,Fri Jun 19 10:46:16 2015 UTC,I could never understand how he got away with shielding so much. I guess his punish game is just so intimidating that nobody wanted to land a hit on shield.

As a long time armada fanboy, I used to get so nervous watching him when he would stay in shield for so long. And then he would just roll or nair out and get away like he's playing some scrub. He uses his rolls a lot too, but I think he's just so good at reads that he can get away with it."

As for the clip you linked, I wouldn't call that ""hyperprecise"" as Hbox very clearly whiffs a forward air offstage which makes him drop the edgeguard.  You're also cherry-picking; for every gif of Hbox missing an edgeguard on a spacey, you can probably make 50 more of him dispatching a spacey's recovery with ease."

Well, that Smash 4 tends to have more of a defensive playstyle and maybe even the most defensive of all Smash games, isn't a secret. (Or am I wrong?)  It's just a total no-go for me, and as I said, I can't enjoy this game. Except maybe ""For Fun""; which I don't have the friends or good enough internet for (had never a non-lagging For Fun match).  However, the downvotes on my previous comment tell me that people still really like this game.  It's up to everyone, of course. But I truly can't understand why people like, or even prefer its playstyle over other Smash games.  And even if probably nobody cares, I don't mean the game itself, which is ridiculously good and getting the kind of support and DLC it deserves as the newest Smash game, but the defensive playstyle. If they would speed up something, nerf the rolls or change a little thing to make it less annoying, I really think more people would start playing it. It doesn't need wavedash, L-Cancel and whatnot. But please, make it somehow less defensive at least.."

I do this with friends now instead of getting my setup out of my car :p  so when you go on netplay, you'll get some input lag from the buffer, but if you play someone close to your location, it will barely be noticeable.  in this clip I had 4 buffer, which is pretty decent since he lives in texas and I live in socal lmao. at 2 buffer you can barely notice the input lag and can easily adapt to it."

smashgifs,3954dc,thelastmanintheworld,11,Tue Jun 9 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"They aren't random? It happens when the hitboxes are tangential instead of overlapping. That means anytime you got a phantom if you had been spacing correctly it wouldn't have been a phantom, it is just another element of the precision of spacing in Melee."
smashgifs,3954dc,Gallscor12,7,Tue Jun 9 19:26:44 2015 UTC,My B.  You're right.  I had it twisted.
smashgifs,3954dc,RathKeno,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"It could work this way, but it doesn't always. I'm pretty sure that this would be a phantom hit. I've also seen Young Link's boomerang phantom before."
smashgifs,3954dc,thelastmanintheworld,3,Tue Jun 9 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"what you linked will not phantom hit, marth's hitbox will continue through falcon and the overlap will come out as a regular Fsmash. This is because phantom hits do not trigger the moment of hitlag that stops hitboxes from connecting multiple times. YL boomerang I have no knowledge of, but either way thats a pretty fringe issue. You will never get a phantom hit on a well spaced attack, so the randomness factor is moot"
smashgifs,3954dc,RathKeno,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"What? I don't understand what you mean. How would it not be a phantom hit?  The way it would work (as far as I know) is that Marth would get the phantom, Falcon would be put into hitlag (not Marth), Marth would continue on with his F-smash animation, Falcon wouldn't be hit because he's in hitlag, then Marth's hitbox would disappear before Falcon exited hitlag. Meaning that Marth would only connect with the phantom and not with the real hit."
smashgifs,3954dc,vixtemplar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"grounded moves that intercept each other will either clank or override if they are (iirc) 7% difference. The pic of marth fsmashing... he will 100% continue his fsmash against a dtilting falcon. You can test this in game, the fsmash will outright beat dtilt because of its percentage difference.   Phantoms ONLY occur when hit and hurt boxes overlap but do not intercept (tangent)."
smashgifs,3954dc,Thebestaround555,7,Wed Jun 10 05:13:25 2015 UTC,The only thing that bothers me whenever this is brought up is that that jab was from sooooo far away. IMO it was lucky to be a phantom not just a miss. I think it was  just mis-spaced nothing more.
smashgifs,3954dc,Andymosity,2,Fri Jun 12 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense. Armada had the read correct, but he jabbed so early that he luckily got a phantom out of it. We can see phantom hits in two ways:   As the edge of a hitbox being 'nerfed' of knockback (and half damage I believe) when tangential to another box.  As a slight extension of the 'normal' hitbox. This implies that this extension shouldn't have been developed in the first place, but rather is there in addition to the normal sized hitbox to add a grazing effect when hitboxes barely (tangentially) contact each other"
smashgifs,3954dc,brandy606,2,Wed Jun 10 07:21:59 2015 UTC,How does this happen in melee? Is it just random?
smashgifs,3954dc,blitzl0l,7,Wed Jun 10 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"thelastman explains it   They aren't random? It happens when the hitboxes are tangential instead of overlapping. That means anytime you got a phantom if you had been spacing correctly it wouldn't have been a phantom, it is just another element of the precision of spacing in Melee."

smashgifs,38lx84,pyromaniaccident,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:31:32 2015 UTC,It does matter. I just tested it to make sure and the only instance player 2 won when both up-b started at the same time was when player2 2's up-b started on the ground and player 1's did not.
smashgifs,38lx84,_AceHigh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"So you're saying when player 2 was below player 1, player 2's up b won. Because there is no hit box below the up b.

smashgifs,38dds9,Crazycupofjoe,8,Wed Jun 3 19:20:59 2015 UTC,I'd assume up. What I'm wondering is if the inputs for the SDI can be buffered whilst you slide from the shine or if you need to just quickly SDI after the jab. If anyone could clear this up I'd love to incorporate this into my game.
smashgifs,38dds9,Alexis2pro,5,Wed Jun 3 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"If you hold up during the slide you get ASDI, which isn't enough to get you out of the jab reset (at higher percents it does work however). Since Westballz was at 10%, he had to get the SDI during the hitstun of the jab."

smashgifs,381eap,LiverspotRobot,5,Mon Jun 1 14:34:52 2015 UTC,"Most people I've asked just tell me it seems too hard for them. I think that he's too different of a concept for most players to want to pick him up and stay with him, if they've already been playing other characters for a long time. I started competitive smash wanting to be a Lucario player and I've been playing him for a year and a half now."
smashgifs,381eap,LiverspotRobot,2,Mon Jun 1 14:42:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I've always thought he was really strong but confused why only a small group play him.
smashgifs,381eap,Lokque,3,Mon Jun 1 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"His inputs are really difficult to master since you can cancel into his tilts (and smashes) with jabs and sometimes a stray hit could mess up the whole timing (or just jabbing too much could go into full jab combo leaving you open for punishment), or you could pick the wrong tilt mid-combo which would knock them away. Lucario's aerials are fairly hard to use, and especially when doing aura-cancels like the one in this gfy (the part where he cancels his down+b approach into nair). Managing aura while doing all those others things makes Lucario the most technical character (in my opinion) in maybe all of smash bros."

smashgifs,380q2k,Chilaxicle,9,Mon Jun 1 01:19:29 2015 UTC,KirbyKaze hit the back of his shield with the uair so he probably thought the shine might send him the other direction which was why he wavedashed in place.

If Marth is holding Falcon or Ganon over the edge of a stage and downthrows, they will bounce off the side of the stage and get sent downward.

smashgifs,37hoi1,AnandOza,25,Wed May 27 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"Here, kids, is why you never CC Peach's downsmash."
smashgifs,37hoi1,pourshootrepeat,25,Wed May 27 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard as spacies considering you want to DI most aerials down/away at low% and how often you want to try to beat out the downsmash with shine or dair or downtilt.   Not trying to be pedantic, but a lot of times you see the 70% downsmashes on spacies are just from people trying to input something else and getting tagged, not actively trying to CC the downsmash like lots of people believe. In that gif I'm 99% sure the Fox wanted to shine her and just got caught."
smashgifs,37hoi1,AP_Renekton,8,Wed May 27 22:52:44 2015 UTC,Trying to shine a peach just as she downsmashes you. That's the worst.
smashgifs,37hoi1,ContemplativeOctopus,1 point,Thu May 28 06:08:44 2015 UTC,"It's part of the matchup. You have to know that you're risking eating loads of % if you try to get shines after low% hits on a CCing Peach, or using it as an escape. You need to get the situational awareness to know when and when not to do a shine, and buffer roll instead."
smashgifs,37hoi1,AmateurSunsmith,5,Thu May 28 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"no doubt, and it's a pretty cool part of the matchup tbh because the punish from the downsmash is roughly as good as the punish you can get on the downsmash. My intention wasn't to whine about it or anything, I just hate how people say ""that's what you get for trying to CC downsmash"" like we're doing that shit on purpose."

smashgifs,37hoi1,xDrSchnugglesx,1 point,Wed May 27 22:23:23 2015 UTC,I am almost certain it's unintended. I think by CC you just DI into certain hit boxes of it. Coincidentally.
smashgifs,37hoi1,TheStupidareFunny,2,Thu May 28 19:23:15 2015 UTC,They probably didn't consider CC. They fixed it in later games.
smashgifs,37hoi1,ContemplativeOctopus,2,Thu May 28 00:54:50 2015 UTC,I think it's actually like 90% if you get hit by the full thing.
smashgifs,37hoi1,Remioli,2,Thu May 28 06:09:19 2015 UTC,"Only on both sides, which you pretty much have to try to do."
smashgifs,37hoi1,ContemplativeOctopus,2,Thu May 28 06:25:51 2015 UTC,Both sides hit inward so if you CC it it can definitely get juggled around in there.

smashgifs,37hoi1,ContemplativeOctopus,2,Thu May 28 08:22:54 2015 UTC,You don't need to get hit by both sides at the same time. You can take well over 70% just getting bounced back and forth.

smashgifs,37j4p1,GSGreg,2,Sun May 31 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"There is nothing that says you cannot land before doing the dair. As long as he's in hitstun from the fair when the dair hits, it's a ken combo.  Check out GRsmash's top 10 ken combos, ken does the same thing. Check out any video where the marth hits a fair then lands, then combos it into a dair. The announcers call it a ken combo."

smashgifs,37hpes,TheQuasiZillionaire,7,Wed May 27 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Basically when smashers say PAL they're referring to the European version of the game.  Without getting too technical, TVs in Europe (EDIT: as well as Australia where this set was played!) use a different encoding system to play movies, games etc. which is called PAL. It stands for Phase Alternating Line. North America and Japan's encoding system is called NTSC.  With Melee though, the developers made changes to certain moves when porting it over to Europe, such as Falco's dair. In the NTSC version, the dair is a straight spike, and would have sent Leffen straight down with no chance to recover. In the PAL version it's not a spike, but a meteor cancel. Plus, as you can see in this gif, the dair has a weak hitbox or a sour spot, but regardless of all of that Mango still takes the stock."

smashgifs,37hpes,AmateurSunsmith,5,Wed May 27 20:05:58 2015 UTC,Falco's strong dair is still a spike. You're thinking of Marth's dair becoming a meteor.
smashgifs,37hpes,AmateurSunsmith,2,Thu May 28 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"Whoops, you're right! Just looked it up and it's only the last half of the dair hitbox that becomes a meteor. Thanks for the correction!"

smashgifs,37dm1d,seacee,13,Wed May 27 02:05:11 2015 UTC,"So, after each one of those tilts I could have faird probably. I chose not to because Moo was smart in that he never DI'd to a location where the fair would have hit him off stage, he could have DI'd the fair down and landed on stage. I just kept building damage and setting up to the point where he was high enough to where he would actually go off stage and die from the fair. The gfy cuts off where it does because I accidentally uair instead of getting the u-tilt, which would have lead in to that juicy fair.

smashgifs,36smgj,RathKeno,3,Fri May 22 10:12:53 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen I sincerely doubt that. Jeapie is pretty much considered the best falcon in europe to my knowledge, he's taken sets off of ice and amsah and games off of leffen. Lord is awesome and all but I feel as though he's a bit over-hyped thanks to a certain falcon round robin."
smashgifs,36smgj,RathKeno,6,Fri May 22 10:28:13 2015 UTC,"Lord's ranked 4th on the Norcal Power Rankings. Considering who the top 3 are, that's pretty damn good."
smashgifs,36smgj,xdhero,2,Fri May 22 11:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. I still think Jeapie is better. It's really just conjecture since they've never actually played, and even if they did it would only really show who's better at the ditto, unless it's a blowout one way or the other. Tell ya whut, if they ever play each other in bracket or a falcon RR or something, we'll put some money on it :P"
smashgifs,36smgj,pyromaniaccident,5,Fri May 22 11:07:01 2015 UTC,I think Jeapie just needs to enter some more American tournaments before we can really tell how good he is.  Lord usually places pretty high when he actually enters stuff.

smashgifs,35xvqm,Rainymood_XI,16,Thu May 14 12:52:30 2015 UTC,This happens in weird scenarios. It's something like if you don't tech then get shined by a stale shine (it has to do <7% damage) this will happen.
smashgifs,35xvqm,Umpalumpa47,3,Thu May 14 12:57:20 2015 UTC,I've been in the situation where the opponent misses the tech and I end up hitting with the second hit of nair as Captain Falcon and they get popped up and can act immediately. Is this the same as what you're describing?
smashgifs,35xvqm,squishywtrmln,3,Thu May 14 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"No, what he is describing puts the ""floating"" opponent in stun where they cannot attack."
smashgifs,35xvqm,aaronisafalcomain,2,Thu May 14 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. Since the second hit of nair does <7% (always 6% or lower), it will send them into this state if they are knocked high enough."

smashgifs,35lv6q,WRXW,3,Mon May 11 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"Scar was in the middle of saying that mango wasn't technical. The impressive thing was the length of the waveshines, the setup and the fact that he did it under pressure."

smashgifs,35i0uw,ahampster,35,Sun May 10 16:00:57 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Lord's knee on Tafokints from TNE
smashgifs,35i0uw,_ACompulsiveLiar_,12,Sun May 10 16:39:58 2015 UTC,Scar honestly had some sick falcon combos. Wish he still played. I remember one of the first combos I've ever seen was that one offstage combo that ended with a stage spike to dair.
smashgifs,35i0uw,Moobl4,3,Sun May 10 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"He still plays, just very rarely. Recently he played at I'm Not Yelling and NorCal Regionals."
smashgifs,35i0uw,not-Kid_Putin,12,Mon May 11 05:48:33 2015 UTC,Can anybody explain to me how I can wall jump after falling from ledge and not use my second jump?
smashgifs,35i0uw,kratosgranola,16,Sun May 10 17:49:32 2015 UTC,You can hit c-stick away to let go of ledge. If you hold in right after hitting c-stick away you'll pull inwards immediately and then you can walljump!
smashgifs,35i0uw,not-Kid_Putin,10,Sun May 10 18:52:05 2015 UTC,Thankyou for the help. Didnt know about the c stick thing
smashgifs,35i0uw,___heisenberg,15,Sun May 10 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"exactly , you must use cstick (lightly! no bairs here) to keep the double jump"
smashgifs,35i0uw,kratosgranola,13,Sun May 10 19:07:21 2015 UTC,And that's what we call a scarjump!  THE MORE YOU KNOW
smashgifs,35i0uw,not-Kid_Putin,6,Sun May 10 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"Since he dropped from ledge and walljumped, he never used his double jump. Once you grab ledge you regain your dj. You just need to move the stick away from the stage and be touching the stage. Kinda like flicking the stick from into the stage to away."
smashgifs,35i0uw,not-Kid_Putin,2,Sun May 10 17:53:32 2015 UTC,So the input would be kinda like -> <- on the left ledge
smashgifs,35i0uw,00ubermensch,5,Sun May 10 18:33:33 2015 UTC,Yeah think down right to fast fall from ledge and ensure you're touching the wall then go left to wall jump
smashgifs,35i0uw,felyneslavetrade,2,Sun May 10 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the help!"
smashgifs,35i0uw,FattyMcPatty,1 point,Sun May 10 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"This is not quite correct. If you fastfall from the ledge you won't be able to walljump in time; to drop from the edge without either drifting away too far or fastfalling you need to release the input within 1 or 2 frames, so the best way is to use the C stick."
smashgifs,35i0uw,markov-,1 point,Tue May 12 10:59:55 2015 UTC,for scar jumping I do away on the c stick then use control stick for wall jump

Copied from a facebook comment:   You see Snake take an extra percent as Marth enters the star KO animation, which means he DI'd out just enough to sit under the blast zone long enough to take one percent of bubble damage before dying.  Crazy situation, though. DI is fucking important."

smashgifs,34zq5y,FishWash,7,Wed May 6 02:59:44 2015 UTC,More that Mewtwo has to shoot the shadow ball then recover if you push him off the stage while charging
smashgifs,34zq5y,041744,3,Wed May 6 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"For characters like Rob and Lucario, pressing the shield buttons while charging makes you airdodge. The lag is risky but lets you cancel the charging... dunno about mewtwo but i'd say there's a good chance he could've done that"

smashgifs,34w9mk,SchofieldSilver,22,Tue May 5 04:16:18 2015 UTC,It'd be a raptor boost cancelled due to that strangle lip PS has.
smashgifs,34w9mk,Plain_,13,Tue May 5 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"There's a lip on that side of that transformation that cancels side-b. You know when you side b off a platform and the animation cancels and you go straight into falling? It's like that, but the distance you're falling is zero. So it effectively just insta-cancels and you can move immediately out of it."
smashgifs,34w9mk,swoodilypooper,10,Tue May 5 04:42:57 2015 UTC,I thought it was more like using side b ing into a very tiny wall. if you were to go straight into falling you'd have specialfall landing lag
smashgifs,34w9mk,felyneslavetrade,3,Tue May 5 06:58:44 2015 UTC,You know how when you go to Venom or Corneria or something and you Raptor Boost/Gerudo Dragon into a wall and it insta cancels? I think he cancelled the side B on the little white lip that pops out during this transformation.

smashgifs,34wbdx,pianodan,7,Tue May 5 04:43:41 2015 UTC,That'd be awesome if it actually is a read but it looks more to me like M2K was just turning around to get back to stage and set himself up for one of his 50/50 or better edge guard situations when Alucard decided side b was a good idea.

smashgifs,34vmmf,Abwezi,2,Tue May 5 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, there is a property in melee called knockback stacking. Without getting too much into the rules of it, if one person is hit by two attacks in quick succession then the knockbacks will stack.  Another case you see this (but may not notice) is during falco's shine combos, you can shine someone up and immediately dair and they will fall down rather slowly: the shine momentum stacked with the dair momentum."

smashgifs,34s064,kbrei,2,Mon May 4 23:01:20 2015 UTC,Is it possible to role or jump out of this pressure?
smashgifs,34s064,WRXW,8,Tue May 5 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"You can buffer a roll, which would be easy to read/follow.  As for the jump I'm not sure. It will depend on the character. A short jump squat (Sheik, Fox) will be helpful."
smashgifs,34s064,petcson,4,Mon May 4 08:56:30 2015 UTC,like kbrei said you can buffer roll  but if done perfectly you won't be able to jump out without getting hit
smashgifs,34s064,spannbowser,1 point,Mon May 4 11:41:42 2015 UTC,"Fox's infinite multishine on shield is the fastest and tightest possible shield pressure, but you can still buffer a roll to get out. Of course, since literally all you can do is roll out the Fox will probably grab you with time to spare. If you try to jump, you'll still get caught by the shine, since Fox has the fastest jump squat in the game (tied with Sheik and others) and his shine will come out while you're still in jump squat (you actually only have 1 frame out of shield stun if Fox's jump is frame perfect but roll has frame 1 invincibility)."
smashgifs,34s064,petcson,2,Mon May 4 12:20:31 2015 UTC,How come we don't see foxes doing this like westballz does with falco?
smashgifs,34s064,Tokeidokei,9,Mon May 4 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"As the title implies, this tech takes TAS-like skill to have any validity in a match setting.  Westballz shine pressure uses alternating double-shines and WD down to have a little more leniency on the inputs.  Example of Westballz shine pressure in this gfy (credit: /u/mylox; video source)  Edit: grammar"

smashgifs,34s064,EsperSpirit,9,Mon May 4 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"""Harder"" is debatable, it's the exact same input except with different timing. Fox has 2 frames jumpsquat compared to falco's 5, I believe falco's shine causes more shieldstun, and falco's shine has a smaller hitbox. Overall Fox players generally just do the multishine input as fast as they can, while falco players have to space out the ""jump"" and ""shine"" inputs properly to avoid empty short hopping."

(When I say you, I mean the streamer)  Sweet clip, but as a bit of advice, since you are streaming presumably, probably with obs, at 16:9 and it looks like you are using a Wii (480p, 20xx 16:9 mode) you should stretch your source to fill 16:9.  To do so click edit scene and I believe hold down shift while dragging.  If your melee input completely covers your screen, your streaming at a 16:9 resolution,  and melee is running in 16:9 mode, your Aspect Ratio is correct!"

I believe it uses the same properties that apply when you hit someone being grabbed/thrown - the player who enacted the throw does not end up in hitlag.  It also could be that Bowser has invincibility frames during that point of his grab; I don't play Smash4 so I don't know frame data at all  Edit: The last part is to explain a possibility as to why Bowser was not hit by the projectile while Larry was"

Toad then reflects more spores back for each time he gets hit, and the whole thing is supercharged by being reflected twice. Peach having the Franklin Badge means that she doesn't get hit by the spores reflected off Ness' bat at the start."

smashgifs,33v66a,Eaglebloo,10,Sun Apr 26 13:06:41 2015 UTC,They gave him no opportunity to tech which was really smart because it would have ended the combo.  Other then that he maybe could have SDI/DI'd the hits a little better.  There were a few times that if he had SDI'd up or the opposite direction he could have maybe gotten out.  But against Armada and Android I'm sure they would have had an answer to any way he DI'd.
smashgifs,33v66a,Voidedmonster,3,Sun Apr 26 15:37:19 2015 UTC,What is the difference between DI and smashDI. I know what DI is but cant figure out SDI. I hear commentators say it alot and i dont know what it is.
smashgifs,33v66a,mbzrl,3,Mon Apr 27 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you'd been told yet, but smash DI is when you input a direction during hitstun from an opponent's move. This causes you to move a small amount in that direction before you get sent flying.  Watch how the mario moves in this clip for a cool and unrealistic example. You can google ""Smash DI"" and look on smashboards for more details."

smashgifs,33sw9p,sederts,0,Wed Apr 29 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"Such hard delineation is not entirely necessary to strictly adhere to when it comes to Smash 4. When talking about a game that doesn't technically have ""spikes"", it's pretty obvious what a person is talking actually about when they say that. I knew that what I said is not completely accurate, but I still used that word knowing that I'd be understood regardless.   But really, ""thunderspike"" just rolls off the tongue better than ""thundermeteor"".   ps technically, ""thunderspike"" is a term that had previously been used for Pikachu's easy kills above the map that he's had since N64. Some characters had easy kills by spiking down, Pikachu had an easy kill by ""spiking"" up. Terminology that the community invents is freaking stupid."

smashgifs,33mivq,team_corgi,15,Thu Apr 23 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"People don't know too much about the glitch, but this is what smashwiki says:   The ceiling glitch occurs when one performs a ground move, then another player immediately performs a move that cancels it out. The player who attacked first will be sent on the second attack's trajectory, but when they are knocked high enough, they will hit an invisible ""ceiling"" that causes them to plummet downwards."
smashgifs,33mivq,InexplicableContent,11,Thu Apr 23 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm not understanding what I'm reading but that is not the cause of ICG.  ICG happens when one player hits a shield (or counter) with an attack, then almost immedaitely after is hit by an attack. Eg, Luigi wavedash utilt fox's shield, fox usmashes OoS, luigi lives due to ICG.  https://gfycat.com/ScratchyMeekIbisbill  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3_vZIRVkvI  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WAZCVkox3I"
smashgifs,33mivq,InexplicableContent,5,Thu Apr 23 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"What makes this ICG interesting is that it's not a result of an oos option by another character, but an item creating a hitbox. My guess is that there's some similar mechanic to the shield in place for boxes and when they explode they produce a hitbox in the same way that characters usmash oos or something like that."
smashgifs,33mivq,TacoBlender19,5,Fri Apr 24 03:19:08 2015 UTC,"No the barrel was simply the hitbox, sheik shielded fox's usmash if you look closely (she stays at 40% the whole time).  It was just a unique case of ICG, like this one"

smashgifs,33k12l,Sickolas,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:59:37 2015 UTC,Duuuuude. Webm is a format that people can upload. Gfycat has its own compression format. They call it gfy go figure.  Gfycat doesn't provide the same compression level for mobile. Thus the 3M. Why the shit would I watch the larger version? I watch the smallest available.

(His platfomrms > his FD). Especially because people aren't used to it yet. NILs are a huge part of that, some of them are relatively easy to get and he's been using those to great effect.  Waveland off of side platform to slightly delayed double jump to NIL on top platform might be the easiest one, and it's really good because Marth often has trouble covering those top platforms. You can also get it by running off of the side platform with the same timing. I've seen PPU use that one a lot.  Really NILs are just a mechanical timing thing for the most part, you start somewhere, press buttons in the right order, and end up somewhere with no landing lag. Not nearly as difficult as perfect wavelands because you don't have to time the final horizontal airdodge."

You can see the Fox dash towards the Marth right before he gets hit, and he might have started a dash attack that we can't see, too.  Also, SDI can sometimes make things look stupider; if they get hit, and immediately SDI (because they were trying to dash back or something), then they'll look like they got hit from further away."

smashgifs,324nka,disturbedtophat,9,Fri Apr 10 20:05:46 2015 UTC,Yeah not really. It's extremely predictable and linear and the only way to change up your recovery is to bluff not having an airjump.
smashgifs,324nka,coopstar777,0,Fri Apr 10 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"If marth sweetspots the ledge you can only edgeguard with an edgehog. A marth in sweetspot range below ledge with a doublejump is very scary for anyone on ledge as he can up B when you arent invincible / refreshing by stalling it out. If you're bad marth has a shitty recovery, but if the marth knows how to recover well it requires a read on the timing of the upB to properly edgeguard or you'll get smacked off the ledge."
smashgifs,324nka,disturbedtophat,14,Fri Apr 10 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"Marth has a great recovery if you have a double jump, if not he has one of the easiest recoveries to edgeguard."

smashgifs,324nka,disturbedtophat,2,Sat Apr 11 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"Similar landing lag as marth's, much harder to intercept since she's intangible and she can go more than one direction and she can grab ledge during her startup."

smashgifs,324nka,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:17:12 2015 UTC,"You can sweetspot up-B out of marth killer range, it's just a bit tricky. I think PPMD does it in this gfy, Armada might have gotten the shield up a bit late but it would probably have missed anyway. The horizontal ledge grab box is actually pretty big, you just can't grab it if you're not facing the ledge so people don't notice."
smashgifs,324nka,the_noodle,2,Thu Apr 16 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"In this gfy armada was just too slow. Horizontal 'sweetspotting' the marth killer is always punishable with an attack oos because it isn't a real sweets pot, he has drift time."
smashgifs,324nka,AbsolutelyCone,0,Thu Apr 16 03:37:48 2015 UTC,"Well first off: ""can only be edgeguarded by an edgehog"" is understated. The edgehog is very easy and if Marth overshoot the ledge he's very vulnerable and a ledge hop aerial is easy.  Second, if Marth has a doublejump he can stall, sure. But nobody is going to get ""smacked off the ledge"" because all it takes to refresh is a slow getup."
smashgifs,324nka,coopstar777,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:26:11 2015 UTC,You do a slow getup and he gets the ledge for free. Nobody refreshes invincibility with a slow getup. And yeah its easy to punish if he lands onstage but the point is that he has a threatening enough presence below ledge with a dj to allow a good marth many options to circumvent the edgeguard and grab ledge

However the sweet spot sound also definitely went off. Does anyone know if it's possible to somehow get hit by both hitboxes?   EDIT: Luigi only did 1% damage. If it was a phantom sweet spot, it should do half of 25% damage. The sweet spot definitely did not go off."

smashgifs,31aoxs,Rainymood_XI,48,Fri Apr 3 10:39:23 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - This is an example of a phantom hit.   Normally, when the hitbox of a move (the area that an attack covers) and the hurtbox of a character (the area of a character's body) overlap, it results in a normal hit.  Marth's sword hits Fox's body, and Fox gets launched.  HOWEVER, hit- and hurt-""boxes"" are actually circles. Circles have an interesting property: they can overlap by exactly one point. Or, in the case of video games, one pixel. In this case, you can say that the circles are tangent.  When this happens in melee (in other words, when the circle of a hitbox is tangent to the circle of a hurtbox), the result is a phantom hit, which deals half damage and has no knockback."

There are two types of tangency: internal and external. Many problems and constructions in geometry are related to tangent circles; such problems often have real-life applications such as trilateration and maximizing the use of materials.

He was annoying in like, 2012, but he's much better now.  Again, the only time that there was exaggerated laughing when his opponent has SDed was in his money match with Chillin. Again, a little lame, but they had both been trash talking eachother for a while att hat point, so it doesn't really seem unfair.  And where does he tier himself alongside m2k? Never seen him say anything of the sort. Although, at this point, it's hard to deny that he isn't among the top 5.

smashgifs,30vci9,HungryThought,12,Tue Mar 31 05:53:42 2015 UTC,"The only thing that I can think of is that Armada could have initially attempted to firefox instead of side-B onto stage. Firefox is a slower option, and hypothetically PPMD could have gone out to hit Armada before he could get onto stage, but the angling options with firefox (sweetspot, diagonal up, sideways) could have forced PPMD into an option select."

smashgifs,2znu1o,cheetahblades,3,Fri Mar 20 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy punish yes, but I found a chance to pull off and show this string/combo (it can be a combo if you frame-cancel the neutral air) that was something I put together using some known ZSS staples that have been floating around (like the two up airs into up b, the down throw into up airs, etc). Sorry if anybody's seen this before at a tournament, I doubt I'm the only one who has thought of this, but this was the result of me testing out how some of ZSS's moves can work together for an early KO out of curiosity. This works at different percents across seemingly most characters (haven't tested everybody yet), although it does not seem to be possible against Kirby, Jigglypuff, or Rosalina as they seem to be too light, although perhaps with further tweaking it could work on those characters, I'm not sure. All that being said, I know this isn't like some amazing combo that you should be actively trying to pull off given the small window that it'll actually work along with being really difficult to start up against a good player, since Nair isn't a safe move to commit to and hit someone with and her paralyzer is a move pretty much anybody will expect to see coming, but it could be really strong if the opportunity presents itself. Just my thoughts on all this."

smashgifs,2z6hk6,Quock,3,Mon Mar 16 00:25:59 2015 UTC,Not sure if side-b reflects projectiles? Maybe some funky physics happened between the pill and the hammer.

smashgifs,2z21rc,astropancakes,4,Sat Mar 14 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"Here's a mewtwo (memetwo?) highlight vid from the stream the other night  The first couple clips are dumb and I don't know why I included them, other than I'm new to using mewtwo and I think all his animations are hype. The majority of the video has some good/funny mewtwo plays"
