You can set two individual 1920x1080 wallpapers with the built in Windows wallpaper manager. I wanted to point it out because i am sure it is easier to find 1920 width images instead of 3840.  Just right click your desktop, click Personalize, go to Desktop Background at the bottom, navigate to your desired image and right click it, it will give you an option to either set for monitor 1 or monitor 2 (etc)."

EmiliaClarke,3apql9,Sammy_Samuelson,19,Mon Jun 22 14:36:31 2015 UTC,What does she have those crutches? :(
EmiliaClarke,3apql9,ArvinMurillo,7,Mon Jun 22 15:31:26 2015 UTC,I think it's for a role and she is getting used to using them so it looks more natural when it comes time to film
EmiliaClarke,3apql9,TexasTango,0,Mon Jun 22 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"She hurt her ankle, based on a quick google. Of course, there's no official word, so it might be practice like you say."

EmiliaClarke,3aawry,PureCFR,6,Thu Jun 18 17:04:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure she sprained her ankle in Spain while shooting a movie
EmiliaClarke,3aawry,Pvtcaboose259,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:37:59 2015 UTC,It's for a role she's getting use to using them for her character

EmiliaClarke,3aawry,PaisanTed,-2,Thu Jun 18 19:46:06 2015 UTC,According to a British tabloid she might be pregnant. Then again she may just be illiterate in Italian.
