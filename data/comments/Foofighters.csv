But I made an ebay listing for it. Right now the high bid is $0.99 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Foo-Fighters-Fenway-Park-7-18-15-concert-poster-by-Brad-Klausen-153-400-Boston-/171865981753?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item280402c339  I would like a few extra dollars in my pocket for my next poster purchase though.

Foofighters,3e180x,DarthReilly,5,Tue Jul 21 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"I would have to take some time to figure out about the casting but I would actually love to see a movie that has nothing to do with Nirvana. Don't get me wrong, I love Nirvana, but we all know the story of Dave's transition and recording the first record by himself and all of that. I would love to see something that actually focuses on the other members of the band. Where they're from, they're personal influence on the band, how the band has influenced them etc. I'd also love to hear about the other members' pasts, like Pat's time in the germs or Nate's time with Sunny Day Real Estate and all of that. I think it would be super cool and interesting since everything is mostly centered around Dave usually."
Foofighters,3e180x,guitardude911,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"Shifty - Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I'll have to think about the rest.  In all seriousness, I don't know about a biopic, because apart from a few obvious exceptions, I don't think there is a whole lot of drama in their history. But, like /u/guitardude911 I would love to read a book that actually has some in-depth history and insight from the other guys. Or the original 4-hour cut of Back and Forth, that'd be cool, too.  edit: Actually, one guy who looks a lot like Taylor Hawkins is Adam Copeland who most probably know as the WWE wrestler Edge. He's in a show called Haven now and he's actually a pretty good actor, and more importantly a big Foo Fighters fan. Course being a WWE guy means he also has about 6 inches and 110 pounds on our boy Taylor.  It's kind of funny how I became aware of him, since I NEVER watched WWE.  Haven Credits: ...AND WWE SUPERSTAR EDGE (no punctuation or context for this still being cast credits)  Me: lolwat (forgets about it)  The show's on SyFy channel so I dismissed the credit as being some weird cross-promotional non-sequitur, so when he showed up later on in the episode, I was just thinking that ""Man, that guy looks a hell of a lot like Taylor Hawkins"" before remembering that oh yeah, ""Edge"" is that wrestler who looks like Taylor Hawkins."

He turned around upon hearing his name and my uncle thanked him for the great set and he took a picture with my cousin who about died because she's about as diehard a Foo fan as you can get.

Foofighters,3dz7en,JohnFuckingSmith,8,Mon Jul 20 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"Well they're allowed to be there just as much as you... Check the ego. And it's up to you how much you enjoy the concert, don't blame other people, work with what you're given. Like I said before, check your ego."

I was trying to by jumping around dancing and having fun but every time I did so I was told to stop or had a forearm shoved in my back."
Foofighters,3dz7en,mtang1982,10,Mon Jul 20 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"Dude, lots of people go to these concerts, they're a universally loved band by families, grown ups, teens, etc. You honestly expected to have your own personal space to jump around?   Everyone has different ways of enjoying themselves, some came to relax and enjoy the music, you came to jump and scream. Find even ground. Just as much as you want to jump and rockout, some people came to chill and NOT do that. And you have to respect that.  No point in coming and posting a rant here. It's all on you that you didn't enjoy it"

Free Me has this insane outro that I can't figure out. Taylor doesn't use a double bass drum nor does Dave, but he's got some real fast thumping low notes, and I think it's just the floor tom but he's also hitting the crash and the snare a lot too, that one has stumped me for a while. This is the hardest one I can think of. (Besides Low already mentioned, or else I would've said that)   I'll look it up on YouTube to see if someone has done the sheet music for it and can just show how to do it."

Embarrassingly enough, our guitarist showed me how to play it (eye roll)  Now it's my favorite one to play when I'm just jamming. We even cover it occasionally!

Foofighters,3donjg,AbidingDude7,5,Sat Jul 18 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"You know it's funny, despite Foo Fighters being one of my favourite bands, I never really thought of any of the 'singles' past about the release of One By One as actually being particularly important on a global 'singalong' scale, but having seen the boys again live recently in the UK I was suddenly super-aware of how much fans seem to have taken 'The Best Of You', a song that I thought was okay at best (on one of their least interesting albums IMHO) to heart in such a MASSIVE way.   The band have obviously noticed this which is why they now close out a lot of their live sets with it, despite it being a bit of a 'downer', but the wall of 'ohhhh ohh ohhhhhh's that reverberate around stadiums more than makes up for it. People were still chanting it as we were leaving the arena about 15 minutes later. The only other time I've had that happen is after seeing Coldplay. It was surreal but awesome to be surrounded by so many other people who loved Foo Fighters as much as I do."
Foofighters,3donjg,peanutismint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:52 2015 UTC,"So glad that you got to enjoy a fantastic Foo experience.  I'm from the states and have seen them twice, and it seems that no matter what song they play here, they seem to get a very strong reaction from the crowd.  I went to my last Foo show by myself, and damn was it enthralling.  They're not my favorite band of all time, but they have an incredible way of bringing people together.  P.S. Personally, I recommend giving In Your Honor another listen (at the very least the first disc).  There are so many great songs that just get you up and make you want to live (Best of You included).  In my opinion, it's one of the greatest albums they've put out, along with TCATS, Wasting Light, and their Self-Titled.  Just a recommendation from one Foo fan to another :)"
Foofighters,3donjg,exoticmess,2,Sat Jul 18 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, the week after the show I had In Your Honor on heavy repeat, and it's not all that bad. I do think, however, that it's part of a 'dip' in their releases (for me), as I think One By One had an INCREDIBLE first half but then tailed off into a mediocre slump that, save for one or two better tracks, didn't recover until the opening bars of Wasting Light, but that's just my opinion as a proper old school Foos fan.   Seeing them live this year was my 4th Foos show (saw them first back in 2002 on the 1x1 tour) and it was probably the best (the best, the best etc) show I've seen them put on. So many great moments. Glad I caught them before Dave's accident. Hope he's back on fighting form soon!"
Foofighters,3donjg,peanutismint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel the same. It's certainly not my favourite song, and it's definitely not their best song, but I think it's the song that moved them from being a really good rock band to being ""the greatest rock band in the World"". There was a noticeable shift in how much bigger they became after this song and In Your Honor came out.  It's the one that everyone,  including all the casual fans at concerts seem to know and everyone shouts along to. Give the crowd what they want I guess!"
Foofighters,3donjg,likeAdrug,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"It's somehow surprising to me, though, as an old school fan who still thinks of the likes of Monkey Wrench and My Hero and Learn To Fly as their most popular tracks to hear a seemingly random song like that taken to heart.   I think my issue with 'The Best Of You' was that, when it first started receiving regular radio play, I didn't think it was that good (comparatively), and the album it was on didn't really grab me either, so it kind of remained locked away in this part of my Foos memory where it didn't have a chance to grow on me... But now that I'm hearing what an impact it has on the crowds live, I'm starting to realise that hidden down deep it's actually a great song and probably one of their most famous/popular."

Source: http://youtu.be/VCmi_xLoH7Q  I'm a big Foo's fan but I really don't care much for their mid 2000's output. It lost the edge that the first 3 albums had. ""Best of You"" never impressed me and still doesn't."

I'm sure some his performances have been less than impressive, and some have been extremely, but considering only maybe 10% of foo fighters shows are taped and even less in which they play that song, it's not really fair to say.

Foofighters,3dlc2a,connorjquinn,7,Fri Jul 17 05:18:05 2015 UTC,"That sounds like such a shitty situation... Hard to enjoy the music like that. I do hope you have a better experience at Wrigley, because hey...it's the fucking Foos, their shows are so much fun. The GA crowd at Citi Field seemed especially rowdy and not in a good way.  There were some obnoxiously pushy people at the show. My friends and I were about 6 rows from the front, and then a group of 4 older folks forced their way into the crowd in front of me. A group of guys and a woman got (justifiably) angry and thus started a shouting match. Almost got physical...right as the show was starting. Really soured Everlong.  (In my act of silent rebellion, I saw one of the older guys try to high five me as I was bouncing to the song...left him hanging.)  Then Monkey Wrench began and about 10 OTHER people started shoving their way to the front. Really? Deflated my hype at the beginning but I managed to enjoy the rest of the show. Sadly, some people are rude as fuck and will do anything to enhance their enjoyment at the expense of others."
Foofighters,3dlc2a,TonOfBricks,5,Fri Jul 17 05:36:28 2015 UTC,"Also went to this show and was next to those same teenagers.

I saw a dude in a blue hoodie across the stage and was like wow he looks familiar. So I zoomed in super close and took a pic and saw it was him. He was on side of stage for at least five songs but I guess they didn't know. He was taking pics of them when they were bowing and when they walked back he said something to Pat who then said something to Dave/Taylor and they came back out!

He still had a ton of energy and really, no one else in the band is injured so they were as great as they always are!  It was my first time seeing them since '97...very different obviously, haha. But they were fucking phenomenal last night."
Foofighters,3dht7h,jewrassicpark,3,Thu Jul 16 12:00:55 2015 UTC,I think it's really cool actually. People cheered loud as hell when the chair started hovering across the stage.   You gotta admire that Dave is still making the effort to do this even with what is obviously a really painful injury. I call out of work if my throat is slightly sore.
Foofighters,3dht7h,DayOff4Superman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:58:00 2015 UTC,PHENOMENAL.  He absolutely killed it and he showed no signs of discomfort/letting the injury hinder his performance. CitiField 1 was a killer show.

Foofighters,3dht7h,DABRONCOS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"Having experience seeing them pre- and post-broken leg, I can tell you not much has changed at all. They played for about the same amount of time as a normal show and everything went as usual, from the crazy, funny banter onstage to the setlist and playing time. Nothing's really changed, except for the fact that Dave's strapped to a throne that hilariously hovers down the catwalk. Though I am excited for the day when Dave does get to run around like crazy onstage again."

My 4 year old went with me to see the Foos in Central Park in 2012 (he was a baby, didnt like being away from mom and wore ear protection). When they started playing he began screaming, so we sat in a quieter spot in the park and listened. He may be a lost cause (wink)."
Foofighters,3ddisg,desertduck,2,Wed Jul 15 15:31:22 2015 UTC,Yes. My 5 year can sing all of Skin and Bones. Some reason he attached to that song of all songs and insisted we listen to it each day driving to school. Now it's a staple in his repertoire of songs he sings. It's quite funny when he'll go right from singing Frère Jacques to a Foo song.
Foofighters,3ddisg,thwg0809,2,Wed Jul 15 15:47:03 2015 UTC,Yes.  My son is 14 and we are going tonight and tomorrow to Citi field.  His first concert was wasting light tour back in 2011.  He is a huge fan.  It was him who took notice of the presale for the tickets.  It is one of the threads of our relationship I truly treasure.

Foofighters,3dbcqi,colour_and_the_shape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"Someone on twitter made a good point about this -- Though their photo policy seems to be a little extreme, in a world where the media is constantly crediting social media for things, why put up a huge fuss about not sending a photographer to a concert? There have been plenty of times where the news media has used pictures from twitter/instagram... For instance, just this morning, I saw on CNN during one of their stories that they literally credited LinkedIn with a picture of someone. If needing pictures for your newspaper is a huge deal, just go on Facebook or instagram and check the Foo Fighters tag."

If I'm not mistaken, they have the most songs available in the online store.   I could see them making another entire album available like they did with The Colour and the Shape, most likely Sonic Highways, as it'd only be 6 additional songs to code. Foos will also be pushing Sonic Highways for Best Rock Album & Album of the Year at the 2016 Grammys, so the timing would work out well there. We'll see! (As you can tell, I'm a big stem collector haha)"
Foofighters,3d5l0t,JohnLocke815,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"Harmonix has shown a tendency to license songs in groups of 3, so I wouldn't be surprised to see another song from Sonic Highways appear as DLC down the track."
Foofighters,3d5l0t,atoms12123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:08:31 2015 UTC,The prospect of waiting 30 seconds for the guitar solo on Outside to kick in sounds more exciting to me than it probably should be.
Foofighters,3d5l0t,roninmodern,2,Tue Jul 14 16:29:39 2015 UTC,Wish they'd just make foo fighters rock band. I'd  buy that. But not rebuying everything for 1 song

If where you live they go every year or so, you can take it easy and go close to the gig hour and see what happens"
Foofighters,3d59ar,alandrad_19,4,Mon Jul 13 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"6pm should be the first performer, whether that will be Mission of Burma or Mighty Mighty Bosstones. I'm betting they won't be on stage until around 8:30pm.   And now I just remembered seeing this earlier: link. Keep in mind there is an additional performer so it should stay on track for 8:30pm.  I'll be at Fenway Sunday and while I haven't planned it out yet I'm thinking about showing up no later than 5:30pm so I can get in, grab a beer and get to my seat."
Foofighters,3d59ar,roccom33,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:38:19 2015 UTC,"You should be in line now! ;)  Depends on what kind of ticket you have and where you want to stand. If you have General Admission and you want to stand right up front so close you get Dave's flop sweat on you, I'd say about an hour before doors open. If you don't care where you stand, or if you have an assigned seat, then kinda show up whenever."
Foofighters,3d59ar,SpeakeasyImprov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:16 2015 UTC,Seats are assigned so no rush to get in for position. I'd aim for 8 if you only want to see FF

Foofighters,3cz7b2,Faggot_Ur,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:44:17 2015 UTC,I was going to make the trip from BC to see the Foos and Stones play FEQ. Glad I didn't go. Would've been hundreds of dollars down the drain.
Foofighters,3cz7b2,tomtaddy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"When it started raining I tried to shelter myself as I could. Then I decided that what the hell, I'll be wet anyways might as well dance in the rain.  Dave told us as long as we'd be there to dance, they'd play for us.  I felt so lucky!  Too bad the lightening and heavy showers showed up too but I can't blame them, they too wanted to see this awesome concert :)  My girlfriend and I rocked out as hard as we could and we had a great time together   When Dave finished fighting against the storm through something from nothing , he said ""It's not safe! It's not safe were sorry""  :*("

Foofighters,3cz7b2,MathBeaudet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:47:53 2015 UTC,"Traveled 13 hours for my first Foo show. Never expected these feelings. So sad I can't see the full show, but so grateful for the beautiful experience. Fans were nice even though everyone was so sad. It was such a beautiful 20 minutes of music before we were rained out. Not sure if I'd trade the experience for anything."
Foofighters,3cz7b2,teamcritical,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"Help me out here, how did they not get electrocuted?"
Foofighters,3cz7b2,milesdizzy,2,Sun Jul 12 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"Luck, mostly.  There's no voltage (at least nothing significant) in mic or guitar cables, but once lightning comes into play it's time to go!"
Foofighters,3cz7b2,HeIsntMe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:36:49 2015 UTC,You sure? I thought it could easily kill you if it's plugged into a power source. I've been shocked by my mic just from my spit lol. Then again I'm not a gear head and haven't played in the rain so I probably have no idea what I'm talking about haha.
Foofighters,3cz7b2,milesdizzy,2,Sun Jul 12 13:01:44 2015 UTC,"Nope. You (most likely) we're shocked by an improperly grounded system. Let me ask - were you holding a guitar at the same time?  Faulty grounding can kill people, but there isn't enough voltage in a mic or guitar to do much of anything. Even a phantom powered mic that has 48 volts, you won't feel even a tickle.   But if you have a guitar plugged into an amp plugged into one circuit, and put your lips on a mic tied to a PA on another, and they don't share an electrical ground point, you've become the bridge for any extraneous voltage and could end up dead.  And that's rain or shine."
Foofighters,3cz7b2,HeIsntMe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:15:01 2015 UTC,Definitely was holding a guitar... Thanks for the heads up lol

Foofighters,3cz7b2,Cykey,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:06:14 2015 UTC,Because they'll come back and do another show for those of you who had tickets.
Foofighters,3cz7b2,thec0lourandtheshape,2,Sun Jul 12 18:04:32 2015 UTC,"Probably not, the show was part of a festival, best we could hope for is a discount on a futur show by showing our festival bracelet"

Foofighters,3cxn8b,JohnLocke815,2,Sun Jul 12 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"I got that soundtrack when it came out (I was 6, give me a break), before I was aware of the Foo Fighters, and when I realized I had it I was pumped.  Even worse is what Jimmy Page and Diddy (then Puff Daddy) did to Kashmir (nothing against Diddy or hip hop, but that song should not be touched)"
Foofighters,3cxn8b,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,2,Sun Jul 12 00:46:42 2015 UTC,This was Daves favorite Foo Fighters song for awhile. Too bad he said that was the worst movie he's ever seen

Before I had heard them, I was a little worried about the future of rock, and these guys have restored my faith. I'm so mad that they aren't opening for the Foos when they come my way. (But we do get Gary Clark, Jr. which is pretty great.)"

Foofighters,3cxkff,Arsid,2,Sat Jul 11 18:50:46 2015 UTC,I know the feeling. I've tried. I think he splits the signal between two amps. Haven't gone that far but damn if it isn't an impressive sound.
Foofighters,3cxkff,Dark115,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yea from what I could see on stage he had at least 2 svt heads playing through what looked like an amped cabinet and what looked like 2 fender hotrod amps bit I'm not sure. He gets a lot of high end, I'm sure he uses an octave pedal and some sort or fuzz I just can't get the combo right."
Foofighters,3cxkff,Dark115,2,Sat Jul 11 19:39:51 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlCA9iapaMs  There you go. All it takes is 2 pedals and 2 amps.  In the video the guy is using a Micro POG but Mike Kerr (Royal Blood) uses 2 pog2s as seen on his board here

Foofighters,3cxkff,roofkelly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:31:41 2015 UTC,I saw them play Lee's Palace last October and they killed it. Such a great up and coming band!  When I heard they were opening for the Foos I was very happy :)

Foofighters,3cttlr,dinamarconi,28,Fri Jul 10 19:11:34 2015 UTC,Well it started when I bought them.. I had to wait 5 hours outside in the middle of winter.. Yeah Canada .. It sucked .. Excuse my french But IT WAS SO FUCKING WORTH IT.
Foofighters,3cttlr,bestraptoralive,12,Fri Jul 10 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Lol I did Beat the Bots as well and never has a Ticketmaster service charge seemed so reasonable. Then being pissed that they added the second date the day BEFORE the one all the fans waited hours for. Sitting on the tickets for months after all that work only to have Dave break his leg and think the show HAD to be cancelled was gut-wrenching. Couldn't have been more than a week out before knowing the show would even go on, and then having that ""he has a broken leg, this might suck"" feeling was a bit of a let down.   So the whole thing was kind of an exercise in completely trampling all expectations then COMPLETELY EXCEEDING the loftiest original expectations.   As an aside Nate came into the bike shop I work at earlier in the week and after chatting I had the opportunity to take him for a little mountain bike ride around the Don Valley in the afternoon before the show! It was a dream day for me too!"

Foofighters,3cttlr,fireground42,37,Fri Jul 10 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"Lol thats it ,.... I bought tickets in the winter.... Yesterday came I went to a Drug store and bought a Bristol board went home and wrote on it.. Went to venue to wait for 7 hours so i would be right up at the front when they opened the doors. Every time he would talk in between songs I would raise the sign. No it was not planned before the show. He kept looking my way and making faces like he was going to call me but he didnt. But when they were going to play their 3rd last song ... thats when the video starts :D.... Sorry im not good with retelling stories but it was much other than lots of waiting. Also the best birthday present ever !"

Foofighters,3cwrxo,exobmb,4,Sat Jul 11 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"i'm a musician myself... so there's a LOT... but a lot of that can simply be attributed to a time I heard a song I ended up really liking, or a time I played a song myself.  Like I still see where I was the first time I heard Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound'  There's a lot of tracks by RHCP from Californication and By the Way that instantly put me in the forested park near my university because I often listened to those songs there...  A lot of other songs I'll be able to relate to my previous experiences even if its a song that's come out since that occurrence happened... thats mostly a lyrical thing where the lyrics specifically apply to a situation i've thought about or experienced. Too many examples of that to list.  Right now i've got this weird thing happening... I kind of leave a certain music video streaming channel on while I sleep. The music video for Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' wakes me up every time. EVERY TIME. So I know that if I hear it later in life it's going to make me think about the time Bad Blood was my alarm clock."

Foofighters,3cwrxo,beastdout,3,Sat Jul 11 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"yep  For example, I listened to a song from Avenged Sevenfold, it's called Fiction, it was written by their drummer the day before he died, recorded only hours after he wrote it, the day later he died.   For me, that song, reminds me of the time I was in a bus to home from high school and I saw a girl who I never saw before and eventually fell in love with her, but that didn't go well.   And then, there's The pretender, that reminds me when I was in first year of high school, and one day I listened to it while waiting for the bus, and since I had an old nokia, I didn't have headphones so I listened with minimal volume and yeah.. I liked the song but I thought Foos were something like Green day, a punk band with relatively young members.   Then one evening like, 3-4 years ago I was scrolling through channels and I saw Best of You from Wembley on one tv station and I fell in love with the song because I liked the sound but, I didn't know who the band was, at all.   I remember liking Shifflet's guitar colour, and Dave's choice of guitar (I was used to watching RHCP, and John Frusciante rarely used a Gibson live, it was always a strat or telecaster).   So later on the TV station aired some cool stuff like Dire Straits, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd etc, and then Foos again..This time it was still Wembley, and it was The Pretender. The station (obviously) put one of those headlines or whatever which was like:   Artist (Foo Fighters)  Song name (The Pretender)  Album (Live from Wembley Stadium 2008)  So after The Pretender, the station ended airing that program and news started, I went quickly on Youtube, searched Foo fighters - wembley and the first result was the full show. I listened to it entirely and I loved it.   That's how I fell in love with the band.   Something from nothing reminds me of the last summer and the anxiety of waiting for radio stations to air the song. It was like ""DAMN IT WHY ARE THEY TEASING US, JUST AIR IT ALREADY"".   And not to mention that I pressed F5 on the sticky /u/fftamahawk009 created like 100 times after the song aired, checking out people's comments and shit...contacting CFOX Vancouver on twitter to see when will they air it, and then it happened.   BBC Radio 1 with Zane Lowe, the first time I listened to him. Then after a few songs of Foos and other bands, they finally played something from nothing, and I unplugged my headset, switched to speakers and turned the volume to the max while my brother and mom were like ""TURN DOWN THE VOLUME YOU IDIOT"".   I didn't care because I thought that I won't hear the song until Episode 1 of SH airs. Boy I was glad I was wrong, then after someone posted the youtube link where Foos officially uploaded the song I replied in the reddit thread like ""The band is smart.""   There's a lot of other songs which remind me of all things. E.g. Can't Stop by RHCP reminds me when I ran away from last 2 classes of the day and I was like, afternoon shift in school, so that was around 5pm, came down the city, went to an internet cafe, and played random RHCP songs on YT, then it came up and I remember playing Team Fortress 2 (aka Hat Simulator) and people were like ""what game is that, wow that game looks cool"".."
Foofighters,3cwrxo,Gamerhcp,2,Sat Jul 11 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ugh...wasn't that day the worst?? They played us like fools, had to listen to some real shit radio for like 3 hours >:O  Also.....wasn't that day the best?? :D"

Foofighters,3cwrxo,johnfreemansbro,2,Sat Jul 11 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"Statues on ESPG. I listened to that album a ton in fall that year. I think my junior year of high school. There was a girl I was infatuated with but always was afraid to ask her out because she seemed out of my league. Looking back the signs were all there, my nerves just stopped me.   It's not a bad time, but maybe a peaceful time, and one that reminds me of the fantastic times I had that year."
Foofighters,3cwrxo,PocketWocket,2,Sat Jul 11 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"Specifically Foo songs, I listened to Word Forward in the hospital waiting room after breaking my leg, so that's a pretty strong link in my mind. Also It's a B-side so I don't hear it often, so the memory isn't diluted."
Foofighters,3cwrxo,xoarar,2,Sat Jul 11 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"The first time I heard Rope I was cleaning my room, listening to the radio. They had said they were gonna premier the first single that day so I made sure to listen ALL DAY. I was so excited, and then I was intrigued throughout the first verse, and then when the chorus came in, I just thought, ""THEY'RE BACK!"""

Foofighters,3cwtl9,Peeel,12,Sat Jul 11 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd recommend either 'Wasting Light' or 'The Colour And The Shape'  Wasting Light, in my opinion, is probably the best Foos album and the most consistently enjoyable.  The Colour And The Shape is also wonderful, with a few well-known classics."
Foofighters,3cwtl9,SHdude,2,Sat Jul 11 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks, I'll be sure to check them out."
Foofighters,3cwtl9,DrummerBoy2999,3,Sat Jul 11 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"After you give those a listen, I recommend you listen to Echoes Silence Patience and Grace next, a really underrated Foo's album with a lot of amazing songs."
Foofighters,3cwtl9,SHdude,2,Sat Jul 11 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"Great album. Has big rock songs like 'The Pretender' and 'Long Road To Ruin', but also has songs like 'Home' and 'Stranger Things Have Happened'"
Foofighters,3cwtl9,DrummerBoy2999,2,Sat Jul 11 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly the reason I picked it, every single song on that album is solid, and its got a perfect mix of rock and calm music."
Foofighters,3cwtl9,chrislopez_,2,Sun Jul 12 00:00:28 2015 UTC,I really like a mix like that
Foofighters,3cwtl9,Powerstars,3,Sun Jul 12 17:37:52 2015 UTC,Colour and shape. its just amazing front to back.
Foofighters,3cwtl9,EnjoyerofCheese,2,Sat Jul 11 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"Wasting Light is my favorite, Colour And The Shape is usually cited as their best."
Foofighters,3cwtl9,campingpolice,2,Sun Jul 12 02:37:59 2015 UTC,"I would recommend colour and shape.  Thats where i feel like the current Foo sound everyone loves really starts.  The first album was mainly just Dave, and you can still hear some Nirvana/grunge in there (not saying it's bad, I love it)"
Foofighters,3cwtl9,ImSmpl,2,Sat Jul 11 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"I just listened to wasting light, I'm gonna listen to that one next. Thanks for the recommendation."

They all act like a bunch of friends that get to hang out and make music and talk about making and playing music .   This quote from Dave really fits    On Foo Fighters: ""You have to understand, we're a really simple band. We think we suck and we try really hard to make good records and we practice. We don't feel like the biggest, best band in the world. We just feel like the same five dorks that were touring in a van 17 years ago, that hasn't changed."""

Foofighters,3cf0ta,Gamerhcp,3,Tue Jul 7 14:37:48 2015 UTC,Completely different cast from Saturday night.  I can only imagine how hot that thing is and how much he sweats inside that cast.  I wore a full leg cast fir two summer months as a kid and it was hot
Foofighters,3cf0ta,juniorman00,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"man i wore an hand/arm cast that was like as long as my hand/arm until the elbow part and since the summers here in south east europe in the last 10 years have been hotter and hotter, it's been a pain to wear it at 35+ degrees. not to mention that i had to attend my cousin's wedding in that damn cast.  and my brother broke some major bones in the shoulder area back in '07, they also had to put metal pins and shit inside to hold it, and the worst part was, the cast covered the whole arm, he wasn't allowed to hold it straight like this: |, he had to hold it in a weird position so to say, basically his right arm/hand was close to the body and the cast covered pretty much the whole back + chest and a part of stomach   and the doctors changed it every day"
Foofighters,3cf0ta,Gamerhcp,2,Tue Jul 7 22:05:34 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think this broken leg thing might not be all that bad. Looks like he is still having a ton of fun as usual. Cant wait to see them in Boston!

Honestly, I wish they had laid off the covers and played a few more foo songs instead. All in all, it was a fantastic concert. Completely threw me by opening with everlong."
Foofighters,3ce00i,Zaidan1,5,Tue Jul 7 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"Only cover I enjoyed was 'Don't say you love me' by Rod Stewart because I hadn't seen Taylor sing it, otherwise I too would've liked to hear more foo songs. Sometimes I think they get caught up in just being a rock band and forget they're the foo fighters. Idk, still a really good show either way."
Foofighters,3ce00i,TimeForSnacks,6,Tue Jul 7 04:52:53 2015 UTC,"Song is called ""Stay With Me"" (with the band Faces from back when Rod could still rock.) I would've liked a couple more Foo tracks as well, but can you really complain?"

I liked the covers, and thought that maybe they needed to do them because Dave was not mobile except for the throne of rock that only moved backwards and forward.  Edit: yes, i can't tell time.  You're right about the 3 hour show."

I mean yeah some people don't really like the all the covers but they only did like 3 and I'm so glad I got to hear ""Let there be Rock"" (even if Dave forgot some of the words :P ).

Foofighters,3ce00i,StallionDuck_,2,Tue Jul 7 13:41:25 2015 UTC,Yes. We came in from the industrial park side and they tried to park us almost a mile away. We drove through some of that projects in the city and convinced them to let us park in the VIP lot. It was only $5 more. Totally worth it though.
Foofighters,3ce00i,windwaker910,2,Tue Jul 7 14:27:07 2015 UTC,Thankfully a woman waved us into VIP parking because it was getting so close to 7. I think getting out of there was much worse

Foofighters,3cbhkt,dasheekeejones,2,Mon Jul 6 20:42:28 2015 UTC,I think it's official since generator is not there even though it was played but improvised. Or someone is really smart to leave it off to name me think just for karma... But who would do that?

Foofighters,3cbhkt,dasheekeejones,3,Mon Jul 6 20:49:03 2015 UTC,Because Big Me is very popular song and the other two aren't...
Foofighters,3cbhkt,maximilliano13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:17:23 2015 UTC,Popular doesn't make it right. Look at Everybody Wang Chung Tonight.  Although I would like to hear Dave sing that.
Foofighters,3cbhkt,dasheekeejones,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:48 2015 UTC,I mean when playing for a stadium full of people yea it does. They play way many people like and so they play the popular songs.   Now when the Foo Fighters play a private show just for you because they realize how fucking special you think you are and how superior you think your opinion is then complain away when they play Big Me. But until then looks like you just gotta suck it up.

Foofighters,3cb5hn,handi-quacks,7,Thu Jul 9 12:32:20 2015 UTC,I know he wrote Walk when his little girl was learning to walk.  I love that song.   What am I saying...I love all the songs.
Foofighters,3cb5hn,Huginkyss,3,Mon Jul 6 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"I always thought Walk was both about his daughter walking and the sort of comeback they had with Wasting Light, I know a lot of people thought that album was a new beginning for them and I thought that song portrayed that also.   Also on a related note I always thought ""Come Alive"" was about his first daughter being born and changing his life"
Foofighters,3cb5hn,tdh999,6,Tue Jul 7 00:05:18 2015 UTC,Actually the first album was mostly written before Kurt died.  I think like many writers they keep the meanings private so that the listener can apply and interpret the lyrics to their own lives and experiences.   Other than Sonic Highways. ...that was done differently as you know.
Foofighters,3cb5hn,ffflildg,4,Mon Jul 6 17:50:10 2015 UTC,"www.fooarchive.com is pretty much the online foo fighters resource for just about everything pre-SH, magazine covers, interviews etc. There's a section where they've compiled snippets from interviews where Dave has talked about various songs called Dave's Song Guide It's awesome even though it's a little incomplete. Some of IYH is missing and there's no SH songs on there but hey, that's what the docu-series is for.   I also have to agree with /u/ffflildg. So many fans fall into the trap of slapping the Kurt Cobain/Nirvana label on every Foo Fighters song when most if not all the first album was written well before Kurt Cobain died and it's something Dave pokes fun at all the time like ""God everyone's gonna think this song is about Kurt but fuck it"""
Foofighters,3cb5hn,8-Bitz,3,Mon Jul 6 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Have you watched Sonic Highways?  Each episode shows how the song took shape.  Sound City is great resource as well. And you can always look through youtube interviews.  He's very forthcoming about his process, but he also doesnt take it to serious.  There's a youtube video where he talks to kyle glass about how easy it is"
Foofighters,3cb5hn,EnjoyerofCheese,2,Mon Jul 6 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"Love that Kyle Gass video. He was trying to prove how easy it was to write a hit song, and all you need to do is add more Chorus. Best part is the song he comes up with actually sounds pretty good."

Quick backstory - I won a SiriusXM contest to attend the Town Hall meeting with Nirvana celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Nevermind in 2011 and made it  a father and son road trip. Max had just started with the guitar and after meeting Dave, Krist and Butch, he really dug in and picked up piano and percussion as well. He takes every opportunity to play. We saw Nirvana at the RNR Hall of Fame induction ceremony, but this will be his first Foo Fighters concert."

Foofighters,3c7q4r,a3p4lesca,2,Sun Jul 5 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"I think it costs more to the full Foo Fighters enterprise to cancel shows. Think of vendors, security, logistics, refunds, hotels, transportation, etc."

I hadn't listened to RDGLDGRN ever and they reminded me of Twenty One Pilots a bit but more rock/hip hop.   Trombone Shorty was fun, again I had never listened to his stuff, I was entertained and his guitarist kind of looked like Andy Samberg.   Joan Jett was so fucking awesome I lost my shit. I'm so glad I got a chance to see her.   Then it rained and cut Gary Clark's set short. I've met him at my job at Borgata and saw his show there. He is amazing and this set, though shortened, was still awesome.   I didn't feel Heart's performance too much. It also seemed short, but I don't know, I wasn't really blown away. I love the band to death, but I was underwhelmed.  Buddy. Guy. Holy crap. Holy shit. He has this kid Quinn with him (forget his last name) and the two of them SHREDDED. IT WAS MONSTROUS. Another thing to cross off the bucket list.   I didn't care for LLCOOLJ or Trouble Funk, but I understand their connection and history with Dave and appreciate their presence. They are not my cup of tea.   What about you guys?"
Foofighters,3c7imz,TheMidnightRambler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"I thought LL was great. Trouble Funk was hugely disappointing.  The rest is spot on. Ann and Nancy were great, but the rest of the band was lacking energy or something."

Foofighters,3c7imz,wetdirt28,3,Mon Jul 6 12:43:03 2015 UTC,"Objectively, the music was great. Was it necessarily what I would WANT to hear for 9 hours leading up to Foo Fighters? Not necessarily. Let me explain...  For those of us that wanted the best spots on the field, that meant arriving at the stadium at 8 AM, four hours before the gates opened. First act didn't start until 1. So that's already five hours of standing and waiting.   RDGLDGRN absolutely killed it. I had never heard of them, as I'm not from DC, and they definitely gained a new fan and I will recommend them to all of my friends.   Trombone Shorty was great too. Had never seen him or heard his music, and this served as a great introduction for myself and probably many others.   Joan Jett still has it. Nothing else needs to be said. She's Joan freaking Jett.   Then the ""lightning"" advisory and tsunami happened. We finally get back to the stage during THAT chaos (you know what I mean if you were there), and out come Gary Clark Jr.   Gary Clark Jr., objectively, is an outstanding musician. I had never listened to his music either, but I would definitely recommend it as well now. He absolutely shreds.   Here's where I'm going to get critical, and surely downvoted. The pacing of the show after the tsunami was all over the place. Gary Clark Jr., to Heart, to LL Cool J, to Buddy Guy was incredibly jarring. Regardless of whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, LL injected some much needed energy into the show, especially after the monsoon.   Buddy Guy is THE blues musician. There's a reason he's won 6 Grammy's. Objectively GREAT musician. But him following LL's all-out show was so jarring. Then Trouble Funk, I feel like only played four songs because they were so repetitive. I respect them, don't get me wrong, and respect their influences. But after 12 hours of standing in the rain, and fighting the anarchic crowd-rush, I was just ready for some Foo's.   TL;DR: objectively great music, great artists, undeniable talent and influence. Pacing of the artists was off."
Foofighters,3c7imz,DInnocentOne,3,Sun Jul 5 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"I drove there from NJ and got to the stadium at 8am, I know that feeling. They also didn't open parking until about 10, so yeah the wait sucked.  I knew I was going to a Foo Festival, not just a Foo Fighters show, so I expected the wait and everything, but yeah it was exhausting. 8am to 1am and a 3 hour drive home? Still loved it, but yes it was tiring."
Foofighters,3c7imz,nimajneb,2,Sun Jul 5 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"What these guys said.  This is exactly what I thought.    We really enjoyed RDGLDGRN.  LL Was my least favorite part.  Heart's singing was amazing, but the band seemed a little rusty.  I caught a couple of minor flubs that you don't normally catch at this level.  But the Wilsons were on point.    Joan Jett definitely won the queen of rock award though.  Buddy and his protege were amazing. Really enjoyed Gary Clark Jr."
Foofighters,3c7imz,wetdirt28,2,Sun Jul 5 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that watching all y'all crazy people rush towards the stage after the rain was one of the highlights.   Thank you all for the much needed entertainment after the rain, lack of food and lots of alcohol."

Foo Fighters were amazing as expected. I will say though, I saw them play at Binghamton University for Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace and it was more intimidate and possibly better, it may have that I was so far away for this and as close as possible in Binghamton. Either way it was fucking amazing.   Edit: Forgot to mention the venue and organization was fucking shit. Probably will avoid an IMP presentation in the future, and probably won't go back to RFK Stadium. I came down from upstate NY to see the show and visit my sister.  They ran out of food...."

Foofighters,3c3n8j,diothar,6,Sat Jul 4 16:37:28 2015 UTC,"Reporting in.    The show was absolutely amazing.  Dave had a custom made throne (see other posts on reddit).  It was badass and took him from center stage down the runway and back.    He was not able to walk, but did get off the tribe and walk down the runway on crutches at one point, doing My Hero acoustic in a normal chair at the end of the runway.    I've been a fan for 20 years (literally bought the debut album on release day, not knowing what or who it was), but this was my first live Foo show.  Loved it.  Lots of changes to the arrangements, stretched out sections, but soo tight musically.  Taylor is a powerhouse.    They played pretty much every hit I can think of.  Did a few deep cuts (for the cows, alone+easy target).    Openers were generally amazing.  Loved Gary Clarke Jr in particular.    All in all great show!"
Foofighters,3c3n8j,JessaFace,3,Sun Jul 5 04:50:53 2015 UTC,"Oh my God, my first live Foo show too and IT. WAS. AWESOME. The AV and sound techs did a phenomenal job, and that throne is a work of art.

Foofighters,3butz1,uncle_meg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:59:25 2015 UTC,At one point you didn't know that either.  That person found out something new.  Good for them.
Foofighters,3butz1,roofkelly,-1,Thu Jul 2 19:01:13 2015 UTC,I've always known. I'm old lol. I was a fan of Dave from Nirvana and followed him to Foo.  I'm probably one of his biggest fans as far as knowledge.  So not everyone went from not knowing to knowing.  Some of us were there for the transition as it happened.
Foofighters,3butz1,ffflildg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:46 2015 UTC,Well you didn't know he was recording in the basement with Barrett Jones until he announced it.  Let the kid learn something new.
Foofighters,3butz1,roofkelly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"We weren't debating the start of Foo Fighters.  The debate was people not knowing that David, the singer from Foo Fighters had been the drummer for Nirvana.  I was simply stating depending on your age,  it's possible to have always known that.  I've always known that the singer of Foo Fighters was the drummer of Nirvana.   But you would be correct that I didn't always know the drummer from Nirvana was secretly preparing to depart and start the Foo Fighters until it happened."
Foofighters,3butz1,ffflildg,2,Thu Jul 2 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"I thought you were the same guy saying ""it's sad people on reddit don't know"" which is dumb.  I misunderstood my friend.  I'm just tired of people being shitty about other people learning something new.  You're cool my bad."

Foofighters,3bw35w,DarthReilly,17,Thu Jul 2 17:01:54 2015 UTC,"Dave was already working on some solo songs. This means the Foo fighters would exist, but probably not in the form it is now."
Foofighters,3bw35w,tristano111,3,Thu Jul 2 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"Grohl has said he felt like Cobain thought he sucked and things weren't good between them around In Utero.  Source - but I think its in their documentary too. Cobain's drug use was pretty bad too, I think.  So I think a more likely scenario is that he would have quit or gotten kicked out and then probably went on to do a solo thing.  Pat Smear probably would have stayed with Nirvana though, even just as a touring guitarist, so Pat not being there would have changed a little of the first incarnation of the band.  And I mean more when they became a band on that first tour, not the first record, obviously."
Foofighters,3bw35w,nurtzof,2,Thu Jul 2 22:49:56 2015 UTC,Didn't it turn out that he heard Dave playing a song and liked it?
Foofighters,3bw35w,DrummerBoy2999,3,Fri Jul 3 03:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember reading that Kurt really encouraged Dave to go ahead and record his own stuff, I think it was This is a Call Dave played for Kurt and he loved it."
Foofighters,3bw35w,jt_hans,3,Fri Jul 3 04:24:47 2015 UTC,Wasnt it Marigold ?
Foofighters,3bw35w,mrjaguar1,3,Fri Jul 3 05:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think Dave did write that, but Nirvana played it before the Foos. There's a Foos song that Dave showed him too."

Foofighters,3bw35w,Bethorz,5,Fri Jul 3 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"Doubtful, I've always thought that Kurt would probably have broken the band up anyways. But there might have been a reunion or two down the road"
Foofighters,3bw35w,comiclover1377,2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"I want to say probably not. Sure, Nirvana was headed towards a break up, but Dave had plenty of offers to go and drum for other bands, such as Tom Petty. I think Kurt's death was the catalyst that created Foo. Yeah, he was already working on songs of his own (had been before Nirvana too), but who knows what he would have done with them. Perhaps a one and done album kind of deal (Late!, anyone?), or occasionally recording one with whatever new band he was with, ala Marigold. I'm sure in the wake of Kurt's passing, he needed something to occupy his mind and time, so he focused on his own music. Who knows if that first album would have ever happened?"
Foofighters,3bw35w,speedracerfx,2,Fri Jul 3 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dave would ever have not released his own music. Would the Foos exist as they do now? Of course not, but some version of something would definitly exist, Dave has way too much going on in his head musically for it not to.  Oh man, can you imagine a world where some version of the Foo Fighters is the indie critical darling, or the hipster alternative to big corporate Nirvana? :P"
Foofighters,3bw35w,Bethorz,2,Fri Jul 3 10:53:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like Foo Fighters wouldn't have been Foo Fighters had Kurt not died. Just a hunch. Things happen for a reason, you know. He would probably go off in a rawer direction. Probably being more indie or playing metal even."
Foofighters,3bw35w,psychothegoat,2,Sat Jul 4 07:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think Dave would have ended up recording the Foo Fighters at some point, but I think a lot of Nivarna fans would have resented Dave for branching out. If Nivarna came to an end those same fans probably would have blamed him for breaking up the band."

Foofighters,3bsixv,jrodjonny,2,Sat Jul 4 13:52:58 2015 UTC,"The earliest it can possibly be is the end of october but its unlikely, the reason that is because wembley has events until october and the foos have not got any dates at the end of october"

Foofighters,3bsixv,mcinerneyconor1,2,Thu Jul 2 12:41:14 2015 UTC,"Should be a few UK arena dates with the European tour really. Wembley depends on if bands are booked in, cause they are limited to how many concerts they can do a Year. Glastonbury is dependent on whether prince pulls out again :P If you are desperate do what i'm doing and go to Paris or Amsterdam and make a mini break of it. I do keep costs down though with being able to bear rough hostels :P"

Foofighters,3bklwo,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"Bubble and squeak:       Bubble and squeak is a traditional English dish made with the shallow-fried leftover vegetables from a roast dinner. The main ingredients are potato and Brussels sprouts, but carrots, peas, cabbages, or any other leftover vegetables can be added. The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides. The dish is so named because it makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process.  It is often served with cold meat from the Sunday roast, and pickles or brown sauce, or as an accompaniment to a full English breakfast.

This is the 9:30 guideline for transportation for this event:   Heading to the show via public transportation? We got some deets for you: Via Metrorail: Orange/Blue/Silver lines to Stadium-Armory Via Metrobus: B2, 96, 97, D6 to RFK Stadium There will also be dedicated drop-off zones in all parking lots for taxis and car services.  Parking is available on site in parking lots 3, 4, 7, & 8 for a fee of $30 in advance (click here), or $40 on event day. Spaces are limited. Tailgating is strongly discouraged. Please note that we are sharing this information as a courtesy. Parking is run by a 3rd party not affiliated with I.M.P.  Violators parking in the surrounding neighborhoods without the proper decals will be ticketed and towed. Please respect the RFK Stadium neighborhoods at all times."
Foofighters,3bo4tz,Kice8907,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:56:31 2015 UTC,We are taking the metro. Trying to avoid that traffic as much as possible.
Foofighters,3bo4tz,WeazelBear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:16:47 2015 UTC,Metro here as well. Staying in Bethesda. Hopefully it doesn't take too too long to make that trek.
Foofighters,3bo4tz,ill_take_the_case,2,Thu Jul 2 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"If you are close to the stop, it's about 45 minutes on average. I would give yourself an hour though."

Foofighters,3bo4tz,snootchie_bootch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:16:50 2015 UTC,Do you know how late the Metro runs? The Foo's tend to play past curfew and I'd like to make sure there's enough time to make it for the train.
Foofighters,3bo4tz,Dhiver,2,Thu Jul 2 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"Metro is open until 3am on Saturday/Sunday http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/metro_service_status/advisories.cfm?AID=5009  I would highly recommend taking metro, if you are heading most any direction other than east on orange or blue from the stadium after the concert, you will get on before folks from The Mall who were watching fireworks, so you'll get a seat."

Having got the emails from Gigs & Tours telling me I'll be getting a refund in the next few days, hearing this makes me think ""DAMMIT!!"". The Foos would also have KILLED it at Glastonbury, instead of that no-talent-ass-clown (thank you Office Space) Kanye getting a shitton of press. People with tickets to this gig - you know what to do: raise the roof enough for all of us Brits who missed out on the cancelled UK gigs and have an amazing time!"

Foofighters,3beuzu,NovarisTheBlueHusky,3,Sun Jun 28 16:29:20 2015 UTC,I saw a video of the Foo Fighters killing it during a rainstorm at Lollapolooza one year. It was amazing. I'm okay with any weather.
Foofighters,3beuzu,WeazelBear,3,Mon Jun 29 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about the weather, I'm more concerned about whether Dave is gonna be able to perform. They keep canceling shows because of his leg."

Foofighters,3b3qxx,awan001,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:33:17 2015 UTC,Middle of July. Like the 17th? And it's in upstate NY.
Foofighters,3b3qxx,josh5180,2,Fri Jun 26 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"They were lined up to support at Wembley. I saw them in a 500 capacity venue last year and it was incredible, I was so excited to see the same band play a tiny club and then to 100,000 people at Wembley Stadium within 12 months.  If their next album is as good as their last, they'll be huge, definitely future festival headliners."

Also, considering there are rumors that they'll still perform at Glastonbury, I don't think they'd cancel their own 20th anniversary show, even if they did just do an acoustic set for it. On top of all that, we're a little over a week away and it still hasn't been cancelled.  Who knows though, the guy could be right.. I hope not though, been planning this trip since Christmas."

Foofighters,3atdvj,trolledbytech,3,Tue Jun 23 15:38:21 2015 UTC,I ended up moving to LA before I could get a ticket to see them without driving to OK or something. They just stick to ACL and maybe Houston I guess.

Foofighters,3atdvj,TheReverendWillyG,11,Tue Jun 23 14:13:09 2015 UTC,i think they should come to my house and make a fucking regular record
Foofighters,3atdvj,bostonbruins922,5,Tue Jun 23 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"I would love if the next album they tossed out all the strings, the acoustic guitars and the keyboards and just made a straight forward rock album. Don't get me wrong, I love what they have done in the past with the strings and all that but I want something simple and aggressive from the Foos. 2 or 3 guitars, a bass, drums and vocals. Nothing more than that. Maybe that's not where they are as a band or people right now but that's what I want."
Foofighters,3atdvj,OatmealApocalypse,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:33:42 2015 UTC,Little late to this comment but in a way that's what Wasting Light was. Strings appear on I Should've Known and there is some light Rami Jaffee keys here and there but for the most part that record is straightforward rock and roll
Foofighters,3atdvj,samcowlam,13,Thu Jul 2 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I want a great regular record, The idea of Sonic Highways was cool but the result was not as good. I can't get into it cause I'm aware they're not Dave's lyrics they're just other peoples quotes."
Foofighters,3atdvj,CyberianSun,7,Tue Jun 23 15:00:00 2015 UTC,I think he stretched himself too thin trying to do it all.
Foofighters,3atdvj,peolerson,2,Tue Jun 23 16:23:35 2015 UTC,I'm glad to hear that other people feel the same way I do. I don't have HBO and I haven't gotten around to streaming Sonic Highways so I don't really feel super connected to the album but I think that's only partially because of the documentary and also because it's not Dave singing words he wrote about experiences and thoughts he's had.
Foofighters,3atdvj,TroyLucas,2,Wed Jun 24 04:30:30 2015 UTC,I would still download the series from iTunes.  It's a great historical experience.  And there are songs I really liked from that album.  The last 2 in particular.
Foofighters,3atdvj,TomM96,14,Wed Jun 24 13:48:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest, although I personally enjoyed Sonic Highways, having to watch a television show to understand an album or a song isn't convenient or appealing for a new or casual listener - I mean Sonic Highways is great for people who are already dedicated fans of the Foo Fighters, but not a great or accessible starting point for potential fans who are only just starting to listen to them.  While it's important for each album to be different to the last one, it should still be accessible to a general audience to avoid alienating them from future fans - that's just my opinion anyway"
Foofighters,3atdvj,earthsick,9,Tue Jun 23 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"Im a huge fan of FF and absolutely watched the show along with the album. But if I hadn't  I cant imagine I'd not understand the songs on their own. They dont have to be taken literally. In fact, no song does no matter the band! I think if you want the background or the story its there for the taking, but it's not required to enjoy the song. You can come up with your own story! Dave himself has said that one of the best parts of his job is being on stage and having a ton of people sing his lyrics back to him all for their own reasons. Sonic Highways isn't any different IMO."
Foofighters,3atdvj,circlesky,2,Wed Jun 24 01:46:14 2015 UTC,I dont have HBO and didn't get to see the show until way after the album was out. Still loved the album and didnt feel like I didnt understand the songs. I agree with you; I can interpret them how I want and have the companion show to give me more if I want to.
Foofighters,3atdvj,Huginkyss,11,Wed Jun 24 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"I grew up on Country and Classic Rock. When I listened to the album Congregation was my favorite song. I was drawn to it. When I finally got to watch the series I was like ""Oh hey, this song speaks to my roots, no wonder I love it so much"". I thought that whole aspect was kinda neat."
Foofighters,3atdvj,StinkiyPetey5,3,Tue Jun 23 14:48:31 2015 UTC,I'm from Chicago and Something from Nothing is my favorite off the album.

Foofighters,3atdvj,manualex16,3,Tue Jun 23 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"i wouldnt like a remake. TNLT was like, similar to WL except for the big production n shit. i wish the new album was a mix of TNLT, TCATS, WL and the good parts of SH. of course, the good parts of TNLT and TCATS being the production and what not.   everyone likes loud music, but face it, big productions have ruined albums. look at one by one. it's a perfect album but the production wasnt very good. WL is the best album, but the mixing was too fucking loud. i dont want to rape my ears by listening to foos. overall, modern production has been like, chanllenge between who's the loudest and what not"

Foofighters,3atdvj,ConnorFin22,2,Tue Jun 23 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"Well. I do want something entirely new, but why can't one of their side projects be a re-make of the first album. I'd love to hear it."
Foofighters,3atdvj,tbazzreturns,3,Tue Jun 23 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. Since 2015 marks the 20th anniversary of the first album, they should definitely try to re-record the album. While some of the songs are played quite often, it would be interesting to see what some of the more obscure songs would sound like (Floaty,Good Grief,X-Static). Perhaps a deluxe edition with a remastered original album and a re-recording of it?"

Foofighters,3atdvj,Kumdogmillionaire,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:38:11 2015 UTC,I heard. He said that the sound of that album is mainly related to the fact that Dave did all of it. Still doesn't stop me from wanting it though.

Foofighters,3atdvj,twizzle101,3,Wed Jun 24 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"Well, making a record sounds always great. To bad they had to cancel some shows but given the circumstances it is completely understandable  Whatever comes next sounds quite great!"
Foofighters,3aus2m,PinkFloydJoe,13,Tue Jun 23 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"However, Grohl seemed to distance himself from Hawkins' suggestions, adding: ""The biggest challenge for us now would be to just load into a studio and make an album like any other band. I'm almost thinking that’s what we should do – go make a fucking record like everybody else does. You know, at our studio. That we built to make albums in.""   Very misleading title."

Foofighters,3aus2m,8-Bitz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"Well Dave spent the majority of 2012 working on Sound City, which heavily involved the rest of the Foos (sans Chris, unfortunately). They then started rehearsals for Sonic Highways in Fall 2013, with recording starting in Chicago in January 2014. I'm not sure of the exact dates, but it was barely a hiatus. The wait between WL and SH was shorter than between ESPG and WL."

Foofighters,3apsrg,Elias_S,2,Tue Jun 23 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"he has two hi-hats because of the way he is positioned on the drums. He plays with his left leg on the bass drum instead of his right. The hi-hat on our right is closed, while the one on our left is open so two different sounds. Sometimes left handed drummers learn to play on right handed kits, or in this case...well you get the idea.

I also like There is Nothing Left to Lose and Foo Fighters (Self-Titled). Some standouts for me are Learn to Fly, Generator, and Gimme Stitches from the former and Good Grief, This is a Call, and Alone + Easy Target from the latter."
Foofighters,3aohvx,notactuallyjoshhomme,3,Mon Jun 22 06:25:45 2015 UTC,Okay thanks alot for this advice! Will check out Wasting Light and other songs you mentioned
Foofighters,3aohvx,Elias_S,2,Mon Jun 22 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"Wasting Light is by far favorite Foo album.  Don't get me wrong, the others are great too but Wasting Light is just amazing in my opinion.  Also, Good Grief is one of my favorite Foo songs and it's just a shame they don't play it live anymore."
Foofighters,3aohvx,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,6,Tue Jun 23 04:17:23 2015 UTC,"The Colour and the Shape is generally considered to be one of if not the best album, and it was the first one as a band (second album but Dave Grohl did nearly all the parts on the first one and formed the band around it to tour). Wasting Light and There is Nothing Left to lose are good next steps.  I'm also a huge fan of the self titled album, but it is pretty different to most of what they've done since."
Foofighters,3aohvx,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:56:48 2015 UTC,Thanks man. So i'm assuming that their older stuff is better/more likeable than their newer material?
Foofighters,3aohvx,TroyLucas,3,Mon Jun 22 14:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, they're fairly consistent. My personal opinion is that the first three albums are the best three albums, but even then there are a lot of great songs on all the other albums.  The earlier stuff, like the first 2 albums had a rawer sound, more crunch and intensity. The newer stuff in general is a bit more poppy, but there's still a lot of hard rocking to be had. If I was ranking the albums, I would say:  The Colour and the Shape (1997) Foo Fighters (1995) There Is Nothing Left To Lose (1999) In Your Honor (2005) Wasting Light (2011) Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace (2007) Sonic Highways (2014) One By One (2003)  Though a lot of people would put Wasting Light higher and In Your Honor lower"

Foofighters,3aohvx,TroyLucas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"To me, while the album In Your Honor doesn't have the strongest bunch of songs, the rock side sort of epitomizes the ""Foo Fighters Sound.""

Foofighters,3aohvx,autowikibot,2,Mon Jun 22 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I love ""In your honor"". It consists of 2 parts, one with great rock and one with acoustic music. I like it cause it shows more than one musical dimension of the band, and because ""Best Of You"" is such a fucking amazing song!"
Foofighters,3aohvx,DarthReilly,2,Mon Jun 22 08:17:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, listen to every album, by their released date. If you get as far as Wasting Light, then check out their biography film,Back and Forth. When you get to Sonic Highways, then it's a trip. Literally. Sonic Highways is an album recorded in 8 different cities with a strong musical influence on Dave Grohl. There is an 8-episode TV show from HBO also called Sonic Highways,that shows how each song is created."
Foofighters,3aohvx,staplesgowhere,2,Mon Jun 22 11:40:02 2015 UTC,"Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways:       Sonic Highways is a 2014 American documentary miniseries directed by Dave Grohl and written by Mark Monroe. The documentary was made concurrently with Foo Fighters' eighth album, Sonic Highways,  and was broadcast on HBO. Grohl described the project as ""a love letter to the history of American music"".  Each of the eight episodes is presented as an exploration of the musical history of a different American city through a series of interviews by Grohl. The group is also shown incorporating what they learned from the interviews into the writing and recording of a new song in or near that city. The series debuted on October 17, 2014.

Foofighters,3aohvx,TroyLucas,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:25:43 2015 UTC,Oh I was kind of hoping that the whole album would have the same sought of vibe as All My Life and Times Like These but most of you guys don't seem to like it at all.
Foofighters,3aohvx,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:57:17 2015 UTC,"One By One was recorded at a difficult time in the band's history.  Dave was preoccupied with playing drums for QOTSA.  Taylor almost died from a heroin overdose.  Band members were fighting with each other to the point of almost splitting up.  After 4 months and a million dollars, they were unhappy with the end result so they threw it away and started over.  There are a few really good songs on that album, like the 2 you listed, but a lot of it is lacking their creative chemistry.  Of course, that's just my opinion, but it seems to be a common sentiment among fans (and band members)."

Foofighters,3alzqx,MrKekskopf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"Probably because the album has some emotion and soul into it instead of being a few hard rock singles and a bunch of hard rock filler like the other albums. Some people just want YEAH ROCK AND ROLL WOOOOO  It's seriously one of my favorite albums of all time, and my favorite Foos album by far"
Foofighters,3alzqx,MisterTelecaster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:55:38 2015 UTC,"No that's not it. Personally I'm not a big fan of ESP&G because of the mixing. It sounds too polished and too overproduced, which is also why I'm not a big fan of Sonic Highways. Don't get me wrong it's a good album (I love Long Road To Ruin and Let it Die) but it just feels a little odd to me. It's too big of a rollercoaster, you get swung from a peaceful acoustic part to a hard hitting rock song over and over again. It works on maybe one or too songs, but almost the entire album is like this.      As stand alone songs I dig most of the album but as a whole it just doesn't cut it for me. Just my opinion, don't kill me for it."

Foofighters,3akez7,qwertyuxcv,8,Sun Jun 21 12:53:34 2015 UTC,"I liked the Sonic Highways experience, but I felt like What Did I Do? / God As My Witness was a weaker track.  Also I really wish that if they were going to go to the trouble of recording horns on the New Orleans track that they could have bumped them up in the mix, instead of overdubbing yet another lead part."
Foofighters,3akez7,TroyLucas,9,Sun Jun 21 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"One By One is their most underrated album. Let's be real, all of those songs had potential. If they had kept the demos or redone the bad ones (Lonely as you, Halo) we would probably have their 3rd best album"
Foofighters,3akez7,Monkeymack,6,Sun Jun 21 06:22:06 2015 UTC,I love that album. From start to finish!
Foofighters,3akez7,gugahoi,2,Sun Jun 21 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"(Lonely as you, Halo)   Wow those are my two favorite non-singles on the album."
Foofighters,3akez7,mfranko88,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"They're not bad songs at all. What I meant by that is that they weren't really executed very well. I see so much potential in those songs, especially in the demos. But parts of the songs aren't very good"
Foofighters,3akez7,Monkeymack,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"Did..did you just say Lonely As You and Halo are the bad ones? That's just craziness. Lonely As You has the kickass three part harmonies into the descending, stuttering chorus, an then Halo, which does sound a little boring at first, is saved by the powerful chorus and kick ass bridge. They are two of my favourite Foo songs."

Foofighters,3akez7,LTComedy,23,Sun Jun 21 07:57:30 2015 UTC,"In Your Honor is the most boring album they've done. Lots of filler, and dull tracks. Worst album they've done, I despise it"

Foofighters,3akez7,ztiberiusd,8,Sun Jun 21 05:14:47 2015 UTC,It's pretty dull of a record but the acoustic songs really come alive live  The 06 acoustic tour was one of the best things they've ever done

Foofighters,3akez7,Arsid,2,Sun Jun 21 08:24:37 2015 UTC,In Your Honor was a really good album in my opinion.
Foofighters,3akez7,Elias_S,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:43:22 2015 UTC,I agree. Something happened to them when they split their focus for this album. I haven't heard another Foo's album that I love since One By One.
Foofighters,3akez7,Shakemyears,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"I could agree, but it makes up with Best of You, Deepest Blues, End over End, and In Your Honor, all incredible songs.     Also, the acoustic side is perfect in my opinion, but we may disagree there."

Foofighters,3akez7,larsbroham,18,Sun Jun 21 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"I really worry that they are going to end up like Green Day where every damn album has to be some big production. (Wasting Light/Back and Forth, Sonic Highways/HBO Series.) As much as I love all the extra content, I wonder if they will eventually jump the shark, or go back to basics and just record an album to record an album."
Foofighters,3akez7,bellmanator,17,Sun Jun 21 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Wasting Light exactly that? Bare bones straight ahead rock album? I know they made a big deal about the analog garage rock recording process, but the album was just fast and loud rock."
Foofighters,3akez7,AviatorBloggins,9,Sun Jun 21 12:54:56 2015 UTC,Wasting Light is my fav Foo album. I watched the live performance video of it over a hundred times. It was perfect.
Foofighters,3akez7,larsbroham,2,Sun Jun 21 04:59:54 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I loved that about Wasting Light, I just mean I worry about subsequent albums being unnecessarily grandiose, but whatever they touch turns to gold so Im sure it will be great no matter what."
Foofighters,3akez7,Dent18,13,Sun Jun 21 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"Dave Grohl is too much of a perfectionist and/or controlling of content  Not releasing the million dollar demos, cutting out songs from the Wembley DVD//Skin and Bones DVD/CD, etc"
Foofighters,3akez7,MrBrink10,13,Sun Jun 21 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"Dave Grohl is too much of a perfectionist and/or controlling of content   This is why William quit the band. Dave re-recorded all the drumming for each track on The Colour and the Shape without even letting William know. Dave felt like the drumming should have sounded a certain way on the tracks, and didn't like the way William's drumming sounded."
Foofighters,3akez7,ffflildg,15,Wed Jun 24 06:36:57 2015 UTC,"William didn't quit, he was fired.  He didn't gel and didn't drum the way Dave liked.  It was Dave's band and his choice.  Taylor is a much better fit both personally and professionally."
Foofighters,3akez7,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,6,Sun Jun 21 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"That was still a dick move by Dave.  I think in general he is a very good guy, but that wasn't cool"
Foofighters,3akez7,ffflildg,16,Sun Jun 21 06:41:14 2015 UTC,Even Dave regrets how he handled it.
Foofighters,3akez7,DrummerBoy2999,4,Sun Jun 21 11:32:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, he felt bad about it but at the end of the day, if his style doesn't fit the band, what can you do?  Foo Fighters isn't some garage band with friends. Its a million dollar business. Dave Ghrol can't fuck that up, and he did what had to be done."
Foofighters,3akez7,saltingthatsnail,2,Sun Jun 21 13:16:28 2015 UTC,"And to be completely honest, you never hear ""man those drums on TCATS could have been better..."" People treat that album as perfection, so while it was a dick move, it may have helped the band in the long run."
Foofighters,3akez7,ffflildg,2,Sun Jun 21 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"He could have told Goldsmith instead of re-recording without Goldsmith knowing.  Gotta do what's best for the band and get the guy that you want behind the kit (especially for Dave), but he handled it like an asshole.  He's still a great guy and I love him, but that situation was handled poorly to my understanding."
Foofighters,3akez7,ffflildg,2,Sun Jun 21 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"As I said above,  Dave regrets how he handled it."
Foofighters,3akez7,Arsid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:12:18 2015 UTC,"I know,  that's pretty much what I originally said.  Goldsmith just didn't cut it to Dave's standard."
Foofighters,3akez7,ffflildg,4,Sun Jun 21 14:36:30 2015 UTC,No I'm pretty sure he quit. When he found out what happened Dave told him he can still tour with them if he wants and William (rightfully) was like fuck that.
Foofighters,3akez7,MrBrink10,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"Semantics.  If you're not allowed to play on the album,  your pretty  much fired.  Goldsmith knew he'd be replaced ASAP once Dave found someone else.   That's why he didn't agree to the last few sympathy gigs."
Foofighters,3akez7,Gamerhcp,2,Sun Jun 21 14:03:34 2015 UTC,"Well, he wasn't 100% fired, considering Dave still wanted William to go on tour with them, but he was definitely done doing any of the drumming on the tracks."
Foofighters,3akez7,a3p4lesca,4,Sun Jun 21 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"well to be fair, a lot of bands release DVDs where they play a day or two at a venue and then don't release half of the songs.   RHCP played at Slane castle only 1 day in 2003 and they cut lots of stuff from the DVD, we found an audience recording which contains everything, from John Frusciante's broken string during soul to squeeze solo to some random talk in the encore before under the bridge, to Flea thanking all the bands that played on that day (QOTSA, FF, Pj Harvey, etc).."
Foofighters,3akez7,HeIsntMe,23,Sun Jun 21 15:27:15 2015 UTC,Pat is the most boring live performer ever. He just 'sways' on stage.

Feast and Famine is a pretty rockin' song but there's no way I'm going to buy an 8 song album with 7 out of 8 mediocre songs on them.  I don't think they're bad, but they're songs that don't sit well with me - they sound like songs that would be played at a live concert where everybody's holding lighters up."
Foofighters,3akez7,Girafarigging,8,Sun Jun 21 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"TCATS was a good album, but it wasn't the untouchable masterpiece that some people make it out to be.  Personally I thought WL was far superior in terms of songwriting and production."

It was recorded in 6 days and it sounds like it, in the best possible way. It has a little bit of a garage-band feel."

Foofighters,3akez7,Shakemyears,3,Sun Jun 21 04:09:15 2015 UTC,"Really don't understand the hype about the acoustic version of Everlong, it lacks the explosiveness of the original version and even if the entire band comes back at the end it's too short of a bit to get everyone pumped"
Foofighters,3akez7,bugalou,2,Sun Jun 21 11:34:48 2015 UTC,"It came out when everyone was, it would seem, fuelled by acoustic versions of songs. I was part if this trend. If I liked a band, I was searching for any acoustic shit they had recorded. That said, I think it is Dave's vocal performance that highlights that version of the song. Often with acoustic versions different parts of the song become highlighted and so they will be valued for different reasons than their original counterparts."
Foofighters,3akez7,99SoulsUp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:41:44 2015 UTC,Agree here.  I much prefer the normal version.   It's much more powerful.
Foofighters,3akez7,DrummerBoy2999,3,Sun Jun 21 16:01:47 2015 UTC,For some reason I get annoyed when Dave hogs a lot of the guitar parts. There are two other guitarists and I feel like he sometimes takes parts they could play.  I'm sure Chris and Pat don't really care that much but for some reason it annoys me.  Especially when you see Pat up there sometimes not playing until the chorus.
Foofighters,3akez7,99SoulsUp,2,Sun Jun 21 21:36:57 2015 UTC,Doesn't Chris do all of the solo's though? I though Dave was purely rhythm guitar?
Foofighters,3akez7,rdrumms15,3,Mon Jun 22 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"Dave does the White Limo and first What a Did I Do? solo.  He also does some lead riffs on Congregation and stuff.  He will often do improvised solos in jam stuff.  I mainly just feel bad for Pat who just stands there half the time, not playing anything.  He's doesn't seem to give a shit though, cuz he's always smiling."
Foofighters,3akez7,LiveInSkin91,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:31:15 2015 UTC,There have been increasingly more solo parts that Chris takes because he plays more technical than Dave
Foofighters,3akez7,Shakemyears,5,Fri Jun 26 06:13:48 2015 UTC,One By One is a terrible album.

Each of the tracks are incredible, and it felt like an incredible Foo album that i'll be listening to for years to come.    Also, my least favorite album is Foo Fighters. Its not a bad album by any means, but I personally don't care for the loud grungy sound it comes with. If I hear one of the songs live? Awesome, I love it, but studio? I'll pass.     please don't murder me"
Foofighters,3akez7,rdrumms15,4,Sun Jun 21 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"i wish they would stop experimenting with ideas such as SH. just go to a studio, record an album like TCATS or ESPG, if you're gonna make SH #2, make the series, don't make the music.   SH is a good album but i mean, 8 songs is nothing, they said ""the last 2-3 tracks are very long and will get a bit 'weird' so to say""  last 3 tracks weren't weird at all, just regular Foo songs, I am a river is literally repeating I, I am a river 10x times, with a happy ending (strings and shit, i liked that).   subterrenean was ok, e-bow + slide guitar + Ben Gibbard makes a good song. but ''weird'', not at all.   outside is meh, the solo is disappointing tbh.   something from nothing solo is nice, but I see all kinds of guitar players soloing with the ""metal"" chord progression, aka the last 4-5 frets that are in the bottom of the neck, yet this solo was just fastly playing the first 2-3 frets, it's easy to play, I expected more from Chris tbh. It's like green day doing a solo with power chords, can't understand what's a solo or what's a regular part of the song.   tl;dr, stop experimenting with SH like ideas, do some non pop stuff, something that isn't ""safe"". all of you have the damn skill for it. experiment with albums like Muse did with 2nd law and Resistance"

Foofighters,3akez7,bugalou,3,Fri Jun 26 06:22:54 2015 UTC,"Dave Grohl is a comfort zone king, not in a positive way though. Every time he's pressed against the wall, or facing new challenges, he thrives. Drumming for Nirvana, making the first 2 Foo Fighters records, doing the Crooked Vultures project and so forth.   Not saying he doesn't handle creative control well, but when he gets too comfortable it usually doesn't end that well."

Foofighters,3akez7,Monkeymack,0,Mon Jun 22 02:37:46 2015 UTC,Foo Fighters is a successful band because of the strength of their singles. Apart from Wasting Light most of the non-single songs aren't great.

Foofighters,3akez7,one_pint_down,-2,Sun Jun 21 22:15:33 2015 UTC,I'd say look at it as a compliment for how great the singles are rather than an insult to the other songs.

Too many people basing their opinions on incorrect information and hearsay.   It's best not to state an opinion unless you know the facts.  Opinion away.  Just don't try to justify an opinion using untrue facts.

I mean he came back right after he broke his leg to finish that show.  The docs probably made him cancel those shows because of the flying around and walking you have to do traveling throughout Europe.   For the North American shows they just hop on a bus and travel right up to the show, so I think us North American ticket holders will be fine. I mean if Travis Barker can break his arm and still do a tour, Dave Grohl will be fine (because Dave is God)"

I remember Dave prefers Oasis over Blur. He cut his hair because he was looking for a new look. And he said the best song of 1997 was 'Let Down' which is awesome probably my favorite Radiohead song.  The song guides were amazing too because I got to learn the real meanings behind some of my favorites and listen to them later with a different experience.  Definitely my favorite Foo site.

Foofighters,3adlxv,Gamerhcp,7,Fri Jun 19 06:47:14 2015 UTC,"Nice interview, one thing that I found fascinating:  ""At 46, Grohl has been world famous for more than 20 years, played in two great American rock bands, collaborated with a roll call of the biggest stars of our age, and has amassed an estimated fortune of £160 million""  Clearly he's successful and with a career spanning albums in multiple bands, touring, royalties, directing, producing etc, but I didn't expect his fortune to be in that bracket.  And another great quote:  ""I’ve seen a lot of my friends have a really hard time with fame. But when the world around you changes it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to change with it. I didn’t go and buy a Lamborghini because I had a million dollars. I was excited that so many people liked the music. To walk into a bar and see some kid air drumming to a song I recorded on, I love that. That’s the way I took it in. It doesn’t make me any better than the kid. It’s just kinda cool."""
Foofighters,3adlxv,spazzyg,5,Fri Jun 19 08:38:18 2015 UTC,Part of that is Dave setting up his own record label for the Foo’s albums. Less middle men taking a slice of the money.

Foofighters,3adlxv,spazzyg,5,Fri Jun 19 09:16:41 2015 UTC,Probably very likely they will be headlining Glasto next year instead and Glasto is one of the things on the Dave's list yet to be ticked off. U2 did it in 2011 after they pulled out in 2010.

Foofighters,3ac1bn,vanillaacid,2,Fri Jun 19 06:07:03 2015 UTC,"I think there's a thin line between tributing and blatantly ripping off.

Foofighters,3aa799,CrimsonKing21,15,Thu Jun 18 13:26:28 2015 UTC,"Wheels! It was the first Foo song I heard and I remember thinking 'WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? I heard it back when it first came out in a store called Xtra-Vision which is kinda like the Irish version of Blockbuster. They had the music video playing on their TVs when the Greatest Hits record came out and I was instantly drawn into the melody and the rhythm of it. It's the type of song you can just put on and chill out too on a cool summer evening drinkin' some ice cold beer. The song made me feel good and before then, my idea of rock was from my mum's CD collection which was Bowie, George Michael and U2. The only heavyish rock music I had heard was the American Idiot album by Green Day, and that's a whole different story! Long story short, Wheels sparked my journey into not only Foo Fighters, but rock in general, with my iPod soon taking place of the cheap as shit portable CD player that you had to stand still with or risk scratching your mother's beloved Bowie album, I  began to look at music in a different way which drove me to pick up a guitar and give it my best shot and f**k  anyone who tells me I can't. TL/DR: I like Wheels"
Foofighters,3aa799,SlapMyBollox,2,Thu Jun 18 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how old are you? Your story sounds very similar to my own when I was first really discovering music when I was 13 or so."

Foofighters,3aa799,SlapMyBollox,2,Thu Jun 18 14:41:41 2015 UTC,Wheels came out in 2009. What other bands have you gotten into since then to expand your horizon?
Foofighters,3aa799,bostonbruins922,12,Thu Jun 18 14:44:37 2015 UTC,"The Pretender. One day I was sat in the car a few years ago when ESP&G cane out for the first time and my mum had it on the radio. Before then I only listened to the UK Top 40. By the end of the song I only wanted to hear hard rock and grunge and thus ended up learning to play bass, guitar, play in bands, gig, write songs and go to Uni on a sound tech course.   So yeah, The Pretender :)"
Foofighters,3aa799,Evillime,3,Thu Jun 18 15:32:45 2015 UTC,Pretender was the first song I ever heard from the foos when my brother played it to me. I've never looked back from then and found they have so many more great songs.
Foofighters,3aa799,handi-quacks,9,Thu Jun 18 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Everlong.  Why?  Because Everlong.  But in all seriousness, even though the first song I heard from them was Monkey Wrench, I still think Everlong is one of their best songs, and it's only rivaled by God As My Witness and I Am A River in my opinion. Everlong really shows how they can play intensely, yet delicatily and emotionally. Wheels is also really good, but there's something with Everlong that I can't really pinpoint why I like it more.  But if none of the songs listed works, and they still don't like Foo after Long Road to Ruin, then I'd give up."
Foofighters,3aa799,Kimmyboii,3,Thu Jun 18 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"I get laughed at whenever I say this, but I truly believe Everlong to be the single best song recorded in the past 20 years.  It's perfect."

I had no idea it was a cover because my uncles band played music similar to the Foos. I told him that I really liked the new song and he told me that it was another's bands song, they were just covering it. He played me the Foo Fighters version and I loved it (especially the music video, still the great music video of all time IMO). He made me a mix CD with some Foo Fighters songs on it that I rarely listened to at the time. I was wayyyyy to into bands like Bon Jovi and Aerosmith at the time and never really got around to the mix CD he made.              A couple of months later One by One came out. I remember being at a Sam Goody with my aunt. She was buying a copy of One by One for my uncle. We listened to the CD on the way home from the mall and I was instantly hooked. My Foo Fighters obsession started that day and I have never looked back."
Foofighters,3aa799,bostonbruins922,10,Thu Jun 18 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"Stacked Actors is in my opinion a perfect introductory song - shows both the melodic and heavier side of the band, plus the riff is fucking badass"

By the time we hit learn to fly, it's usually ""ohh yeah I've heard these guys before"" etc. Then if they're curious I play a bit off of the soft side of In your Honor."
Foofighters,3aa799,lilnippy,6,Thu Jun 18 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"I tend to show people some of their newer stuff like Something from Nothing, because it is a feel good hard rock song, but Everlong is a good one to show, because it's an absolute classic!"

Foofighters,3aa799,DrFarfanigglePhD,3,Thu Jun 18 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"Dang, I'm not sure I can remember the first one. I'm 24, and as long as I've been listening to rock radio, Foo Fighters have been a thing. I'm sure I heard Best of You and My Hero a ton when I was young and just never solidified a memory of it.  But I do remember All My Life. I loved that it felt a little heavier than their other songs up until then, and I remember being in the car with my dad, air guitaring to the song, having my dad turn to me, laugh, and say ""They're pretty cool, huh?""  Edit: Just realized I totally didn't read the full thread title. Don't care, I love this story. I couldn't pick just one song to introduce someone to Foo Fighters."

Foofighters,3aa799,AdamParmenter56,2,Thu Jun 18 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"Ok.  I'm a massive FF fan since the beginning (following Dave from Nirvana).  First EVERYONE knows Everlong.  Not everyone may know it off top or that it's  the FF, but it's a classic.   So I usually play that and people are ""oh ok, I like this song.""  Then,  it depends on the individual.  Some I play Aurora or one of my all time faves Ain't it the life.  Maybe even the acoustic stuff.    Some I play harder stuff.  Depends what I think they would most like.   The 20 year catalogue of Foo Fighters music has,  in my opinion,  enough nuances to appeal to most anyone.     Another thing I've learned is that some people may just not ""get it.""    That's ok.   WE get it.  Their fans get it."

Foofighters,3aar6d,ffflildg,2,Fri Jun 19 05:03:50 2015 UTC,It used to be on YouTube until they recently wiped a shit ton of Foo videos and Foo dedicated youtube channels. So many great live shows lost too. Not too sure why it isn't available more though. It's like their DOA video.

Also the fact that the album begins with ""you know in all of the times that we shared, I've never been so scared"" and eventually ends with ""I'm not scared"" makes it absolutely beautiful"
Foofighters,3a7hi4,b00mtown,3,Wed Jun 17 20:52:12 2015 UTC,This site was created by some FooFighter super fans in the hope of showing Dave some fan love after his spill the other night. You can also use the hashtag #SignDavesCast on Twitter and the site will pick it up. Apparently they are going to make a cast sleeve and send it to him.

Since the US tour ends in november, I'd guess that'll be the first possible slot for a reschedule. Coming from the cold north it seems kinda unthinkable, but maybe the weather in England isn't as cold in the winter as in northern Sweden."

He'll still be in a cast even!   But I'm sure they will reschedule at least the big shows but not for  maybe another 6 months or at least until tour  ends in October.
Foofighters,3a59gj,wwfc550,2,Fri Jun 19 05:12:19 2015 UTC,"Don't think that will be happening that soon.   This is at least a 3 month injury plus pt.

Foofighters,3a30ms,Pqqtone,4,Tue Jun 16 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"Not selfish. You paid your money like everyone else. The good news is, knowing the Foo Fighters, they'll probably reschedule, and you might be able to keep your current tickets. The bad news is, this is a long ass tour and may be a few months. A few years ago I had tickets to see Green Day in January, and in the November prior to the show Billie Joe went to rehab and had to cancel our show. Fortunately they rescheduled it to late March and I didn't have to buy tickets again."
Foofighters,3a30ms,ffflildg,9,Wed Jun 17 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Knowing Dave and the Foos,  the shows  will be rescheduled likely in the late fall after the original dates.

It's be much easier and quicker of a healing process to be resting than to be stressing out over touring from city to city. Also, he probably can't put on his best shows when he's having to heal, and I'm sure Dave only wants the best, the best, the best, the best for you."

Foofighters,3a30ms,xilonian,3,Wed Jun 17 03:55:01 2015 UTC,Generally takes 6-8 weeks to fully heal (sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less). July 29 / August 5th is about that time give or take a week or two. Seems feasible he will be healed but we don't know if there will be scheduling issues with non cancelled shows  / re-scheduling shows at this point.

Foofighters,3a2vbx,TheFaceo,3,Fri Jun 19 22:11:16 2015 UTC,Listen to the Muse one for the best idea of how great this mixing can be. Really cool transistions between songs.
Foofighters,3a2vbx,joshkg,3,Wed Jun 17 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"The difference between mixing a Muse album vs. a Foofighters album is that a lot of those transitions are predetermined. Here we have a whole bunch of songs spanning the entire discography of the Foos, lots of different ideas/themes/sounds that were never really meant to fit together like an album.   I'd have to get all the songs together and find out what makes a cool transition and what songs are better off untouched. Now, if this album is going to be released as one whole 1 hour piece of music, that would certainly make the mixing a lot easier. If it is individual songs then that means I would have to chop them up and if you wanted to listen to just one song, the intro may be missing because I put it in the outro of the song before it."
Foofighters,3a2vbx,TheFaceo,2,Wed Jun 17 02:54:49 2015 UTC,Nope. Same exact thing as Muse. Listen to the Muse subreddit album. Sounds brilliant. http://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/2idwql/rmuse_subreddit_album_here_it_is/
Foofighters,3a2vbx,joshkg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of muse songs have a pretty slow fade out (relatively) because their albums are made to express a certain tone. Their progressive rock roots are very different than the Foo's punk roots. The Foo's have a lot of abrupt stops: striking a chord, Single drum beat, etc.   Also, the downvote button is not an ""I disagree"" button. My comment contributes to the discussion and was very relevant."

Foofighters,39rpmm,iamgaben,3,Sun Jun 14 17:47:18 2015 UTC,Same here!  Hoping for the best. Dave is always awesome to see live and I don't think the possibility of him being in a wheelchair will ruin the show at all.
Foofighters,39rpmm,SHdude,5,Sun Jun 14 09:49:50 2015 UTC,Perhaps they could set up a giant Hot Wheels track for him to zoom about on!
Foofighters,39rpmm,gruffi,2,Sun Jun 14 11:06:40 2015 UTC,"If they have a catwalk like Wembley 2008, they can put him on a motorised wheelchair!"

Foofighters,39rpmm,JoshH21,3,Tue Jun 16 03:49:54 2015 UTC,I'm sad to say this but it is usually 2 months recovery. So it will probably be 2 months of sitting Dave!
Foofighters,39rpmm,Jontebert,3,Sun Jun 14 12:09:03 2015 UTC,He's only got 4 toes!
Foofighters,39rpmm,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,3,Sun Jun 14 11:08:38 2015 UTC,My hero!
Foofighters,39rpmm,Qwistahn,2,Sun Jun 14 13:42:48 2015 UTC,I just think he's such a badass AND class act.  Perfect.

Foofighters,39q90u,SHdude,10,Sat Jun 13 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"Same here. Been waiting for next Saturday ever since I booked my tickets.   I wouldn't mind Dave rolling up on a wheelchair. That alone would be a pretty cool bragging right to have. ""I saw the Foo Fighters the week after Dave broke his leg that one time."""
Foofighters,39q90u,Bacon-Stripz,6,Sat Jun 13 20:59:19 2015 UTC,Same with me
Foofighters,39q90u,handi-quacks,5,Sat Jun 13 20:02:33 2015 UTC,He needs to do a Kurt Cobain at reading in '92 and come out in a wheelchair and then play an amazing show
Foofighters,39q90u,agnos85,3,Sat Jun 13 23:30:09 2015 UTC,I'm really sorry for you! That sucks...
Foofighters,39q90u,iamgaben,3,Tue Jun 16 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"Same here, I'm flying in from Sweden to see them, thought Wembley would be cooler than Ullevi. Jokes on me. Will be going to London anyways since I didn't order refundable plane tickets."
Foofighters,39q90u,DrummerVim,2,Wed Jun 17 09:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, non refundable plane tickets here as well. Tonight I got tickets for Les Miserables on the West End as replacement for the Foo concert!"
Foofighters,39q90u,iamgaben,2,Wed Jun 17 21:01:26 2015 UTC,Sounds nice! I bid you a good trip and we'll see eachother at the next Wembley concert instead. ;)
Foofighters,39q90u,DrummerVim,2,Wed Jun 17 21:29:19 2015 UTC,Vi ses på Wembley :) or however you say it across øresund

Foofighters,39q90u,chrislopez_,12,Thu Jun 18 03:52:22 2015 UTC,He should be fine by July right?.......RIGHT!!!?
Foofighters,39q90u,KwibStick,8,Sat Jun 13 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"He will likely still be in a wheelchair or not completely walking yet, but I doubt the July shows are in much danger of being cancelled. I have tickets to 7/16 at Citi Field."
Foofighters,39q90u,lennon011,6,Sun Jun 14 03:37:56 2015 UTC,Yea i've got tickets to the July 8th show in T.O.

Foofighters,39q90u,Hyzy,2,Sun Jun 14 22:03:01 2015 UTC,"July 9th in TO for me & my son, part of his HS grad present.  Last show before college.  Coming up from Buffalo hotel already booked I am hoping we know soon!"
Foofighters,39q90u,lennon011,4,Thu Jun 18 17:12:31 2015 UTC,"He should be okay by then. He's scheduled for surgery. He may just not be moving around as much as normal. It's Dave, you know it's someone else forcing him to cancel the shows!"
Foofighters,39q90u,DiscipleofGrohl,3,Thu Jun 18 20:00:19 2015 UTC,I sure hope so! July 19th is my birthday AND the show I'm going to.
Foofighters,39q90u,likeAdrug,19,Sat Jun 13 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly say the thinking behind cancelling these 2 shows is so he'll be rested for Wembley - there's no way he wants to miss that or Glastonbury.   Whether he has to sit for the gig I guarantee those gigs will go ahead.  Anyway, you don't need your leg to sing and play guitar!   EDIT: Well shit. I was lucky enough to be at Slane for this tour, I feel for you guys that are gonna miss out. Glastonbury on the TV wont be the same either. I'm sure they'll be back though."
Foofighters,39q90u,killermonkey87,7,Sat Jun 13 22:25:48 2015 UTC,I am really hoping you're right. I have been wanting to see Foo Fighters live since i was about 15 years old. Thats a long fucking time to wait. Was so excited to get tickets for the Wembley show.
Foofighters,39q90u,foofarley,4,Mon Jun 15 07:50:18 2015 UTC,Based on the x-ray the reason is those shows are canceled is he will require surgery to fix that.
Foofighters,39q90u,likeAdrug,3,Mon Jun 15 19:44:43 2015 UTC,rest/surgery/recovery/whatever it takes. That's pretty much what I was referring to.

Really sorry guys."
Foofighters,39q90u,BigLim,4,Tue Jun 16 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"Rather selfishly gutted. Traveling the length of the country for 19th, got other stuff but Foo Fighters was a big part of it"
Foofighters,39q90u,gruffi,6,Tue Jun 16 20:53:05 2015 UTC,Gutted. Unbelievably gutted.   The £250 flight to Edinburgh is still gonna be used though - gonna spend a long weekend partying and putting  Too Fighters songs on repeat in the jukeboxes in pubs!
Foofighters,39q90u,iamgaben,5,Tue Jun 16 21:51:39 2015 UTC,are they a tribute band?
Foofighters,39q90u,alakurt,4,Tue Jun 16 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, much better than the Poo Fighters actually."

Foofighters,39q90u,Stitchosaur,8,Wed Jun 17 06:16:02 2015 UTC,Belgian radio says Dave already has been seen at Wembley today
Foofighters,39q90u,jrodjonny,7,Mon Jun 15 08:30:17 2015 UTC,Hopefully they make some kind of announcement soon then. I just wanna know either way!!!

Foofighters,39q90u,jrodjonny,7,Tue Jun 16 21:09:16 2015 UTC,Bummer. Edinburgh was going to be my first Foo Fighters show. I really really hope they reschedule
Foofighters,39q90u,Bacon-Stripz,5,Tue Jun 16 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they will manage to reschedule for some time in the future, in Dave's message it sounds like this is the plan if possible...""We’re doing our best right now to work out a plan, so bear with us""."
Foofighters,39q90u,admh574,4,Tue Jun 16 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"Realistically, how difficult would it be for them to reschedule shows such as Wembley and Murrayfield? I feel like Dave would try his best to reschedule because everyone knows how much he loves these shows and his fans, but I'm not sure how complicated that would be."
Foofighters,39q90u,jonnybarnes,4,Tue Jun 16 21:40:41 2015 UTC,Wembley is pretty much summer only due to the heavy sports program and the fact that a large percentage don't really want to go to an outdoor concert in December or January
Foofighters,39q90u,admh574,2,Wed Jun 17 03:54:37 2015 UTC,"Except Wembley has a roof, so it'd just be like going to a really large arena."
Foofighters,39q90u,jonnybarnes,2,Thu Jun 18 19:26:48 2015 UTC,It doesn't have a roof over the pitch. The roof only covers the seated areas
Foofighters,39q90u,HaemoRage,2,Fri Jun 19 08:35:45 2015 UTC,Oh :( I'd always thought the retractable roof could cover the pitch as well.
Foofighters,39q90u,WollyGog,5,Fri Jun 19 09:00:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man what a bummer. Was totally stoked for Wembley, but I guess the man does have to recover. A real punch to the gut though. Damn."
Foofighters,39q90u,explosivetom,4,Tue Jun 16 21:20:20 2015 UTC,Just seen the news for Wembley. Such a bloody shame but it had to be done. Get well Dave! His health comes first.  Looking forward to seeing them soon.
Foofighters,39q90u,Pjonze,4,Tue Jun 16 21:25:10 2015 UTC,Guessing we will hear soon for up to glasto if dates are getting cancelled. I would assume there would be a lot of pressure from werchter and glasto to get a yes or no to find a replacement.
Foofighters,39q90u,Donsta,6,Sat Jun 13 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"Glastonbury's organiser Emily Eavis was just a few weeks ago telling NME that although Florence & The Machine are playing before Foo Fighters she considers Florence at a level where she could headline now.  So if FF do pull out, you'd imagine Florence would move up & they'd squeeze a new band in elsewhere in the line-up."
Foofighters,39q90u,Squby_Du,4,Sun Jun 14 07:43:23 2015 UTC,"Really hoping the Fourth of July show isn't cancelled, got a plane ticket and hotel room booked..."
Foofighters,39q90u,Donsta,4,Wed Jun 17 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here. Dave's health is most important, so if the show is cancelled, plan B is have a great weekend seeing the sights in DC."
Foofighters,39q90u,speedracerfx,3,Wed Jun 17 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, just hoping Dave's better by then"
Foofighters,39q90u,gruffi,3,Thu Jun 18 16:12:24 2015 UTC,I'm wondering what they're going to do about the motorcycle rally beforehand. There's no way Dave is going to be able to ride a bike in a couple weeks. Cancel it? Stick him in a sidecar? I was just about to buy a ticket when I heard the news about his leg.
Foofighters,39q90u,jrodjonny,3,Sat Jun 20 03:14:04 2015 UTC,Come on Faux Fighters. Time to shine!

Foofighters,39q90u,WollyGog,4,Fri Jun 19 17:10:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather they postponed the show tbh.
Foofighters,39q90u,ttam86,5,Mon Jun 15 09:10:26 2015 UTC,I'm still torn between the two tbh.
Foofighters,39q90u,EVH98,8,Mon Jun 15 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"Me too, and rescheduled. His health is more important. Wouldn't sitting down affect his vocals too with the big screams?  Without sounding morbid, I wish I'd been at that show; Taylor covering while he gets patched up? Yes please!  On the plus side they could always do an extended set where Dave sits down and drums for a while. That would be amazing."
Foofighters,39q90u,3ogadsehteb1,8,Mon Jun 15 16:20:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the thought process on my end is that Dave won't be as wild and capable to rock the fuck out as the show deserves. I don't want probably one of the best nights of my life to be a muted performance, it may be good, don't get me wrong but it won't be the same."

Foofighters,39q90u,StratcatNC,2,Fri Jun 19 16:59:43 2015 UTC,Are we thinking they'll definitely be playing their show in dc? I'm a little hesitant to buy tickets now
Foofighters,39q90u,Fabs93,2,Sat Jun 20 01:57:14 2015 UTC,"I have tickets already, I hope to be pleasantly surprised that he has recovered by then, but realistically I just don't see it.  Of course I have excelled at being wrong before."
Foofighters,39q90u,StratcatNC,2,Sat Jun 20 18:17:58 2015 UTC,I could see Dave just playing in a wheelchair or sitting down. Rescheduling/cancelling an entire tour is suchhhh a steep cost for a band. Especially when most of the shows are sold out.
Foofighters,39q90u,Fabs93,2,Sat Jun 20 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, and it would still kick-ass.  I am hoping you are right!"

Sam Smith also canceled on the same day, I'm not sure why I'd still go, Pharell Williams is closing now and I don't feel this is an adequate replacement.  On the other hand, it seems Josh Homme is at the festival, maybe there's a possibility for a surprise there? Or is that just wishful thinking?"

It was an amazing concert, after falling from the stage into the pit dave said to the audience that the foo fighters would come back another time and that he really needed to go to the hospital, the others continued to play a few cover songs and people started to leave.   While they played david bowies ""under pressure"" Dave walks (with help from some medics) in again in the on the stage in the middle of the song and joined Taylor on vocals, very epic! And then they played two or three songs, he was sitting in his chair while they took care of his foot and stuff haha. He said ""i won't leave until the doctors tell me to"" and after a while he walked off stage to get a cast, he came back with a bottle of champagne and sat (and rocked out) for the rest of the show!

Complete fracture and a displacement which almost surely requires surgery and a long metal plate with a bunch of screws inserted. The gap in the ankle joint looks a little wider than in should be too, so there might be tendon and ligament damage, but that's just a barely educated guess.  The fact that he finished the show is frankly astounding. Hopefully they had some decent pain meds for him."
Foofighters,39n90o,bigmike67,2,Sat Jun 13 20:54:39 2015 UTC,not a doctor but it a broken right fibula it will most likely require surgery and then a 6 week recovery.  i just hope this doesnt effect his  future drumming

VIP motorcycle parking, exclusive and early entrance to the show too.      All my friends are cheap bitches though, so I'd have no one to ride down or hang with for this.

Foofighters,38f7x7,SamGamesPro,16,Wed Jun 3 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure if he does do it live, but what's the big deal if he hasn't. You can listen to almost any track on almost any record from almost any artist/band and find things that they are never going to reproduce live.   Take a bunch of the tracks from Wasting Light. There are so many layered vocals in these songs that unless you somehow got multiple Daves, reproducing them live is never going to happen. Not to mention not wanting to pay the high cost of touring with a string section.   Songs on a record are simply one version of a song, with limitless possibilities for the most part. But it is, in my opinion, a testament to good songwriting when these same songs can be taken from the form that was put down in studio, and worked into different boxes. If this didn't happen we would never have seen the awesome result that came from trying to do an acoustic version of Everlong. Which is probably worth not getting every song exactly as you hear it on the record. If you want to hear the song like it was recorded, listen to the record."

Foofighters,388rm2,Eder_Cheddar,7,Tue Jun 2 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, a lot of musicians have played with Paul McCartney, but I think that's because Paul likes to play with as many people as he can :)"

Foofighters,387n4f,StrangeSitch,2,Tue Jun 2 15:39:26 2015 UTC,Yeah they were brilliant. They also did a cover of Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy but my finger was over the mic on my phone so the audio is a little muffled.

Foofighters,37xa4l,Whoneedsspaces,3,Sun May 31 04:25:44 2015 UTC,"I think people don't like OBO because it's very overproduced, which is very un-Foo like. It almost has a plastic feel to it."

Foofighters,37xa4l,8-Bitz,4,Sun May 31 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"To me this was always a track that got lost in the mediocrity of One by One. But it is an alright track. I would love to know what the lyrics are about. I always liked to think that maybe that first verse was supposed to be a cynical outlook on women (good and bad, I swear I've had, both are overrated but isn't it fun when you get hold of one etc. Etc.) the rest of the song doesn't support that though. It would make sense as I could be wrong about this but I believe Dave was in between marriages at the time. Women might have been something in his mind and he may have had a less then positive assessment of the situation."
Foofighters,37xa4l,Shape_Shiftr,3,Sun May 31 04:22:08 2015 UTC,A quick glance at the lyrics seems to imply it's probably about Dave's relationships with women.

Foofighters,37xc9p,Iwillgetbanned,1 point,Sun May 31 16:47:34 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing about Foo Fighters B-sides is there are a ton of people in the fan base that have no idea they even exist. They're never given to iTunes, Spotifiy or any other mainstream distribution service and can only be found online or on physical copies. It's something special for the hardcore fans. As for the availability, it does kinda bum me out but remember, ESPG was only 2 albums ago, there's probably some wasting light B-sides/sawdust that well see for a record store day release or something. Then we have Sonic Highways, just look at the way it was made; one city, one song, that method of making the album doesn't really produce any unreleased recordings. What we saw is what we got."

The weather could have been better, without the rain, but that didn't stop Dave, Chris and Pat from going to the ramp and jamming. I loved the setlist. It had a good variety from old and new, even throwing in some covers like Under Pressure, Let there be Rock and Jailbreak. I don't think anything could match how I am feeling right now. I'm just amazed."
Foofighters,37wno0,sx2l,3,Sun May 31 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"I loved the rain to be honest, we were in the pit so it was warm anyway and that cooled everyone down. Plus it gave the guys a truly Irish experience :)"

Also, since I'll never have a right thread to put this in, to whoever made the awesome header with the band snoos, my one silly little nitpick is that Shifty's RL eye colour is blue (and I'd also, personally, make Nate's hair a few shades lighter, but that is more up to interpretation)  /girl"

Foofighters,37u6ri,one_pint_down,3,Sat May 30 12:39:32 2015 UTC,I'm not a professional or anything so this is probably terrible but I think this is a great Foos song that's possibly spoiled by the production quality so I had a go at remastering it.
Foofighters,37u6ri,a1993k,2,Sat May 30 12:42:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing!  The vocals are definitely a lot clearer and crisper, and the drums are a lot more noticeable in the heavy part, although they do sound a bit tinny. Overall though,  great job! I know very little about audio remastering, what was your method for working on this track?"
Foofighters,37u6ri,a1993k,2,Sun May 31 07:33:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Well I just put the original song into Logic, played with the EQ a bit, mainly boosting the high and low frequencies, also reducing around the buzz but it's hard to get rid of without the rest of the song sounding odd. I also added some reverb to make it sound more spacious and put it through a compressor to bring out the quiet parts."

Foofighters,37q2it,radicalpragmatism,2,Fri May 29 17:34:49 2015 UTC,If I had to guess as for why there was never an apology it would be either a) They haven't done anything like that since and it would be bad press to bring up an event that most people have forgotten about or never heard of or b) They've completely forgotten about it.

Also anyone who takes medical advice from a musician or former playboy playmate ( Jenny McCarthy and vaccines ) is really just looking for someone to agree with them no matter what the evidence or doctors say .

Autism activism and views on vaccines of article  Jenny McCarthy:       In May 2007, McCarthy announced that her son Evan was diagnosed with autism in 2005. Before claiming that her son's autism was caused by vaccination, McCarthy wrote that he was gifted, a ""crystal child"", and she an ""indigo mom"".  Evan's disorder began with seizures and his improvement occurred after the seizures were treated, symptoms experts have noted are more consistent with Landau–Kleffner syndrome, often misdiagnosed as autism.   She has denied that her son was misdiagnosed.   In a 2014 Daily Beast article, she says her son is now 12 and doing okay: ""Evan's amazing,... He doesn't meet the diagnostic characteristics for autism. He definitely has quirks and issues from the seizures. He has a little bit of brain damage due to his seizures. He doesn't qualify for any more services, but he does have issues in his school.""  McCarthy served as a spokesperson for Talk About Curing Autism (TACA) from June 2007 until October 2008.  She participated in fundraisers, online chats, and other activities for the non-profit organization to help families affected by autism spectrum disorders. Her first fundraiser for TACA, Ante Up for Autism,  was held on October 20, 2007, in Irvine, California. She is a prominent spokesperson and activist for the Generation Rescue foundation,  and serves on its Board of Directors as of January 2011.

Foofighters,37q2it,mrjaguar1,3,Fri May 29 23:35:39 2015 UTC,"I found the top comment about their newer music being bland and generic to be very interesting. I would say that maybe Sonic Highways isn't their top album, but from what I gather a good number of us loved Wasting Light. The songs listed from TCATS definitely are great, but they also have the perspective of time. It's still too early to see how songs like Walk and The Bets of You will fare in comparison as being ""classic."" And I would disagree when the second comment says their stuff is so safe. I would call Sonic Highways a huge risk."
Foofighters,37q2it,SHdude,3,Fri May 29 14:35:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call their newer stuff bland and generic.  'Outside' and 'In The Clear' are pretty damn unique in their catalogue. Even with the more straight-up rock albums like ESPG and Wasting Light, songs like 'Stranger Things Have Happened', 'Home', 'These Days' and 'Arlandria' are all pretty damn unique.  Reddit's tendency to circlejerk against people liking stuff really annoys me."
Foofighters,37q2it,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,2,Fri May 29 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"Going off of your list of unique songs, 'Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners' is one of favorite acoustic songs, I'd say it's extremely unique in its picking pattern and sound, plus it's entirely instrumental. Maybe these people are only looking at the radio singles? But how are we really classifying one song as 'unique' over another? By how they compare to every other song from every other popular band out there? In my mind Five Finger Death Punch has a very unique sound overall, but from what I've heard of their catalog all of their songs have that same sound and it becomes bland to me. Knowing the Foos whole catalog though I can pick out the songs that are wildly different from each other and on top of that also get a sense of 'sound' for each album.  EDIT And the circle jerk can flow both ways. They could probably argue that this entire sub is a pro circle jerk for Dave and the band."
Foofighters,37q2it,TheMidnightRambler,1 point,Fri May 29 16:48:47 2015 UTC,I mean yeah that's kind of the point of a dedicated sub
Foofighters,37q2it,feighery,2,Fri May 29 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"At the very least, it certainly costed a lot of cash.  But it was risky for fans too, interestingly enough. Personally, I really don't like about 50% of the SH album. Congregation is flat out my least favorite song. But calling it safe would be a lie. I will give them the utmost respect, because they are certainly trying something different when they get in the studio."
Foofighters,37q2it,_JackWilshere,2,Sat May 30 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"Back in 2005 they headlined Oxegen here in Ireland with Green Day. James Brown was playing in one of the tents at the same time as the foos were on stage. Dave encouraged anyone who wanted to see James to go and go now, during their own set, as they would be around for a long time but it's not every day you get to see James Brown. He even lamented not being able to go over there himself for a bit.   Considering he died the follow year and I'm just on my way back from the Slane gig now, it was good advice."

DG was hilarious and on point, even with a couple of bum notes. Setlist was pretty good but realistically they'd never play my perfect setlist and I am happy with whatever they play. The rest of the band felt a lot more part of the show and boy are there some awesome surprises for people seeing them in the future.   Main criticism, which is pretty similar for all stadium gigs is the fucking phones. Taking a picture or two is fine, I get that. Taking multiple pictures of each song and many long recordings of shit quality versions of the song including recording the screens side of stage is just inconsiderate. But unfortunately this seems to be the way things are going."

Foofighters,375qsp,8bitremixguy,8,Mon May 25 05:27:04 2015 UTC,"Watching this was sooo dope, love seeing Dave slowly win over a crowd that might not totally have been there for Foo Fighters with each successive song. Got me hyped up for seeing them at Wembley."

Dave, at the end of Everlong: ""we are gonna play as many songs as we can so let's keep this going""  1 hour later, I've watched the whole thing..knew that was going to happen.  Thanks for posting OP!!"
Foofighters,375qsp,jhonnyonthespot15,3,Mon May 25 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to be there and the set was amazing live.  Especially when you consider that the previous acts on the stage were Taylor Swift, George Ezra and Rita Ora - not necessarily having the same sort of fan base you'd expect to go to a FF gig."

Foofighters,36qv1r,MrSterlock,24,Fri May 22 02:54:06 2015 UTC,I always liked Letterman and I obviously like the Foo's but I was really taken back with how fast that Slide Show Picture Montage was going. I know they had to pack a lot of memories into 6 minutes but it was like bang bang bang bang. Friggin video chaos on the eyeballs. Foo's played well though :) Show was descent too.
Foofighters,36qv1r,Greendrummer,18,Thu May 21 13:32:47 2015 UTC,I thought they were trying to show the videos in time with Everlong. Like the fast parts were fast and the slow parts were slow.

But it's not like it was anything mind blowing.  It was just a nice sendoff.  He said goodbye, they played a lot of old clips, foo fighters played with more old clips, the end.    Again, not trying to be rude or say you're wrong.  Just not sure why this would be considered one of the best finales in modern television, or why this episode alone would win an Emmy."

Foofighters,36slrt,Acorrie2011,8,Thu May 21 20:04:07 2015 UTC,As far as skill goes Chris wins

Foofighters,36slrt,sledge96,3,Thu May 21 20:51:14 2015 UTC,I really wish they'd let him run wild a bit more in their work
Foofighters,36slrt,OatmealApocalypse,5,Sat May 23 00:52:50 2015 UTC,Chris first obviously but Nate is definitely second. He's a very under rated bass player In my opinion and always plays perfectly on time and always seems so indulged in the music. She he doesn't play as flashy as Geddy Lee or Flea but he knows how to write a damn good bass line that flows so well with 3 blaring guitars around him.
Foofighters,36slrt,TiitsMcgeee,3,Thu May 21 22:32:13 2015 UTC,Chris>Dave>Nate>Pat. Its a coin flip for the last 3 but Chris is definately the best guitarist.

From the original Foo Fighters post-grunge -esque, to the Colour and the Shape's timelessness alternative style, as well as There is Nothing Left to Loose which has a really rich, striking auora about it. That period from 1995-2000 was among their best in my opinion. Of course, all the newer albums are also quite good."

It's the brainchild of Taylor and Shiflett. Occasionally and whenever the fuck he feels like it, Dave will pop up.  They perform locally in SoCal cause that's where they kind of all live now. I went to a performance at this Pizza Parlor (seriously) and the place was packed.  I think it was a little after Wasting Light was finished. I stood outside the window and saw them play. After the show they took pics with people. After wards they seem to end up playing the same kind of venues with a small festival here and there."

Foofighters,35isuj,DOMAN127,3,Sun May 10 20:34:43 2015 UTC,They aren't framed. They're held in with little hooks in the wall with plastic covers for protection. It's super easy to take them off the wall and listen to them.
Foofighters,35isuj,DOMAN127,2,Sun May 10 21:43:15 2015 UTC,I meant that they're still sealed. It looks like you used an x-acto knife...for whatever reason. Why not just take the wrap off altogether? It looks weird with the hype stickers.

I don't recall seeing kids at the shows I've been to so I wasn't sure if it would be ok.(or if there were age restrictions)The tickets with seats are almost $300 but I don't want my brother to get pushed around by drunk/stoned people so I need to save a little more money.Hopefully it's not sold out before I can scrape some cash together.
Foofighters,358tww,yoduh4077,2,Fri May 8 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"Don't get lawn tickets, OP. If you're gonna give the kid a great first concert experience, get seats. Plus the stoners always occupy the lawn, you don't want the kid getting exposed to that."
Foofighters,358tww,gravity1981,2,Fri May 8 08:57:06 2015 UTC,"Two guarantees:  Dave will drop a lot of F-bombs.  The Foos will ROCK and he will be a fan for life.  The last Foo show I went to, Dave actually called out the youngest kid in the crowd... Put the spotlight on him, made him feel like the coolest person in the place, questioned his parents for taking an 8 year old to the show (you're doing it right), and brought the place down.    My kids are all Foo fans.  I'd take them.  The Foos put on a great show.  I would make sure any kid had a seat though."
Foofighters,358tww,WheninRome,2,Fri May 8 11:14:03 2015 UTC,"My daughter is 7, and will be seeing them for the second time this summer!  To mirror a tip others have mentioned: Seats! below briefly mentions why.  Her favorite song of theirs is Skin and Bones. She waited and waited for them to play it, but it was their Wasting Light tour. About 1.5hrs in, she passed out in her seat. They played pretty late that night, so her falling asleep is fine. Also, we all had our bubble thanks to the seats, so I consider it a good environment for her, being 4 at the time.  They never played Skin and Bones. She was bummed about that, but she enjoys many of their other songs also."
Foofighters,358tww,Teeklin,2,Fri May 8 13:12:08 2015 UTC,"Put together a playlist for them both of some songs they're likely to hear, let em listen, then take em to the concert and they'll have a blast.  A lot of music appreciation when you're younger is just about familiarity, so when you have good taste (like you obviously do posting here!) you just gotta expose them to good music as often as you possibly can.  Take em out for a burger or some ice cream and blast the music in your car on the way there and back, give em a taste of everything from Everlong to White Limo and you'll find some lifelong concert buddies to see Foo with in no time."

Foofighters,3540n9,loudassguitars,3,Fri May 8 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"I believe it's BS too. I'm sure Dave got a screener of his content added in to the final cut of the film, and after Dave screened it, Dave wanted nothing to do with this documentary. If the special edition comes out with Dave's part added in, I'll stand corrected. Let me say first though, this is a fantastic documentary. Very, very cool visuals the film maker did with Cobain's original notebook-artwork-journals coming to life, and hours of personal audio recordings of Cobain's thoughts layered over, very cool! But, unfortunately the film reveals what I believe to be the ""real"" Kurt Cobain and his ""not-so-popular"" struggle with mental illness. I did learn more info from the doc on the lifestyle of Cobain, especially those last couple of years. My opinion of Kurt Cobain is still the same as it was before. Cobain was an ""idiot savant"" with a sad-twist of fate at the end. And that sad-twist of fate is most people, and I hate to say it, but especially his bandmates, probably knew he would do what he did in the end. This documentary, intentional or not, painted the picture Love wanted in my opinion. That everyone, friend or foe, used Cobain from beginning to end, and that is what drove the man mad. I believe Dave was one of Cobain's friends that knew Kurt had suicidal tendencies, but being so young and living that unnatural rockstar life at that age, Dave thought it was just a part of the show, never dreaming Kurt would actually do it. I believe Dave wants the Cobain story to remain as positive as possible. If that's a bad idea for Dave to feel that way, then it's a bad. But if you think about, and think of it as you being Dave, and Kurt was your good friend, and you both shared this really ""unnatural-popular-pop culture event"" in American history, wouldn't you want your friend remembered more positively, and less as a guy with a dark history coupled with mental illness and neglect? I would. Thinking of the good times versus the bad. I mean really, what good does it do for anyone's legacy to be further labeled as an even more damaged human being, who killed himself over repeated cries for help, no real help for his mental illness and deep depression? Cobain said all in his music. No one is listening, no one is helping, I'm losing it, I can't sleep, I'm failing, I have to leave, I think I'm dumb! It maybe sad knowing what we know now. But let this man rest in peace. He's earned it! I think Dave made the right move."
Foofighters,3540n9,arty_mcfarty,6,Mon May 11 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like BS to me.  Courtney commissioned the movie and it's well known that her and Dave hate each other.  Also, you could argue he knew Kurt for much less time than most of the other people in the movie.  I mean, Chad Channing isn't in it either...."
Foofighters,3540n9,likeAdrug,3,Thu May 7 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's even more well known that Courtney and Dave have buried the hatchet and made up. However, you're right. Novoselic didn't even have a massive part in the film either."

Foofighters,351ehs,TheLoneGrangerDanger,3,Wed May 6 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno, those songs are already kind of harder rock than the newer stuff anyway.  Something like New Skin or Favorite Things would be interesting to hear Foo cover but how different would it be style-wise?  Guess we'll never know, but I hear it pretty close to the original in my head.  Give em a song like Wish You Were Here, Love Hurts, or 11am and who knows what it might turn into?  I just like the idea of turning those lilting high notes of Brandon Boyd into the screams of Dave Grohl and flipping a lot of those songs on their heads.  On the surface it doesn't sound like you could turn something like Warning into Foo Fighters hard rock, but looking at the lyrics I think it's something that could work pretty well.  Wish I had a cover band who loved both bands as much as I did to play around with some of the ideas in my head for how those songs could go.  Alas!"
Foofighters,351ehs,Teeklin,2,Wed May 6 14:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand what you're saying here.  Something like Nice to Know You, Just a Phase, or Beware! Criminal would be pretty cool from the Foos.  Yet, it would still amuse me to hear something like You Will Be a Hot Dancer or  Trouble in 421, but unfortunately you're right it probably won't happen.    It reminds me when Incubus covered Black Hole Sun that was pretty sweet to hear."
Foofighters,351ehs,TheLoneGrangerDanger,2,Wed May 6 14:43:55 2015 UTC,Timebomb by Dave Matthews Band because it already sounds like a Foos song.

THIS NEEDS TO BE A THING STAT!!!!"

Foofighters,34c8kj,bestjamesbr,5,Thu Apr 30 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, there are 2 ways you can approach removing vocals  The first method is basically muting the middle spectrum of the song waves. This is usually where vocals are seated in the song. To keep it simple, I use programs like audacity and riffstation to find the vocals in a wave, and mute it.  The second method is essentially gathering all of the multi tracks of the song and just deleting the vocal track. This is what I did for Learn To Fly and Something From Nothing. So yea, I have the seperate tracks of the instruments on me.  Google how to isolate vocals on a song for more info really."

Foofighters,348vlo,Turn_On_The_Dark,11,Wed Apr 29 12:30:45 2015 UTC,I expect it's a good song to learn in... times like these...
Foofighters,348vlo,Lucas_Rennie,6,Wed Apr 29 12:42:52 2015 UTC,Wooooow...
Foofighters,348vlo,PaulGallacher,17,Wed Apr 29 13:33:23 2015 UTC,Everlong is very easy

Foofighters,348vlo,RealCSD,2,Wed Apr 29 14:17:07 2015 UTC,First song I learned to play on Rocksmith
Foofighters,348vlo,ClickClickBoom94,4,Wed Apr 29 13:55:02 2015 UTC,don't forget about big me that's another easy song
Foofighters,348vlo,chrislopez_,5,Wed Apr 29 10:40:00 2015 UTC,Big me

Foofighters,348vlo,DarthReilly,5,Wed Apr 29 21:03:35 2015 UTC,Wheels is only 4 chords over and over again and it sounds nice on acoustic.
Foofighters,348vlo,yoduh4077,4,Wed Apr 29 06:19:15 2015 UTC,Times Like These is pretty much the same riff over and over again.
Foofighters,348vlo,Gamerhcp,2,Wed Apr 29 06:33:17 2015 UTC,The 7/8 time signature in the intro might be tough to grasp for a beginner.
Foofighters,348vlo,FrankstonGirls,4,Wed Apr 29 10:00:53 2015 UTC,"pretty much a lot of foo songs are few chords, depends which guitar part are you playing, Dave being the vocalist plays simple parts because you dont want the lead singer to play 50 chords in chorus"

Foofighters,348vlo,owlsrule143,3,Wed Apr 29 18:07:57 2015 UTC,If you can play F#m and Gm subterranean is somewhat easy and sounds amazing
Foofighters,348vlo,DoctorDevil,2,Wed Apr 29 14:33:09 2015 UTC,"it's actually not a regular F#m and for a beginner, the actual chord would probably be difficult to make with tight fingers. and it doesn't sound as cool using just a basic chord like that."
Foofighters,348vlo,owlsrule143,2,Wed Apr 29 19:08:46 2015 UTC,Fair enough. What variation do you recommend?
Foofighters,348vlo,DoctorDevil,4,Wed Apr 29 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"An F#m barre chord has the low E and high e pressed on the second fret because of the barre across the neck.   Remove those two and you've got the chord.   Index finger on g and middle finger on b string (2nd fret each)   Ring finger on A string and pinky on D string (4th fret each)  It's an interesting stretch but it sounds so great.   When that chord first came on when I listened to sonic highways for the first time, I was like holy damn! What a chord, and the acoustic guitar took me by surprise. My #1 wish for the album was just even 30 seconds of acoustic guitar somewhere in the album.   Wasting light was good but I missed the dynamics of echoes.   Edit: mute the low E but let the high e ring open with that chord"
Foofighters,348vlo,owlsrule143,2,Wed Apr 29 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"Ill try it out! And agreed, i really loved the contrast between songs like let it die and stranger things have happened. It made for a very dynamic experience"
Foofighters,348vlo,DoctorDevil,2,Thu Apr 30 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"Let it die and come alive are two of the best songs foo fighters have ever written and recorded. Simply outstanding.   But, honestly was the first song I listened to by them when I decided to check them out and was instantly hooked. That song is so beautiful and then kicks ass at the end, and it holds a special place in my heart. Also lyrically after a rough break up 2 years ago it really spoke to me and it felt like I had wrote it somehow.   Home is just perfect. Perfectly composed, dynamic, elegant   Check out my edit to the previous comment btw"

Foofighters,348vlo,owlsrule143,4,Wed Apr 29 10:23:34 2015 UTC,"Simple, just get a tuner, and follow the tuning down from low E and tune it down till it hits D. Look it up if I'm no help, I'm terrible at explaining things"
Foofighters,348vlo,ricker182,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:28:37 2015 UTC,"Any tuning that has ""drop ___"" Implies that the low E string is a whole step down. So if it's Drop D, then all you have to do is tune the Low E string to D, while keeping the other strings in standard."

Foofighters,348dtj,Modeno,7,Wed Apr 29 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that their sound has evolved so much since their first album. Every album really has its own distinct sound to it. And on top of that, they make a lot of diverse songs. Some really hard rocking songs, some that are soft and personal, and a lot somewhere in between. So it's hard to say one song embodies all of that. BUT to play along, I'd say ""Learn to Fly"" is the closest you can get. It has a loud, full sound while still coming across very relaxed. And while the lyrics aren't the FF's deepest, they're still meaningful and tug at the heartstrings a bit."
Foofighters,348dtj,Dent18,6,Wed Apr 29 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends what you like about their sound  For me I'd say My Poor Brain. It's both grungy and heavy while also breezy and smooth."
Foofighters,348dtj,Godfodder,8,Wed Apr 29 13:54:35 2015 UTC,Severely underrated song
Foofighters,348dtj,owlsrule143,6,Wed Apr 29 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"I find the first three albums have a distinctly similar feel to them, and the last five moved on from that and they have their feel, so there's two different groupings.   Strangely enough though I think Subterranean goes back to The Colour and the Shape, so that's quite a stretch bringing it all full circle. But it's not a very fun answer.   I'd agree with Monkey Wrench, although I almost hesitate to because it's kind of obvious. Strong intro, catchy chorus, solid ending with screaming. It has pieces to be found in every album following."
Foofighters,348dtj,Karrottz,2,Wed Apr 29 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"i totally think Subterranean was perfectly capturing of the foo fighters sound. i noticed that when i first listened to it, it's really a classic foo fighters written and voiced song. but definitely uniquely sonic highways."

Foofighters,33vliz,mrjaguar1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:35:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for answering your site does look interesting . But if you do not mind I do have a few questions   1 Is it possible to specify specific bands when you order ie foo fighters or nirvana in the alternative genre or specify a band in a genre I do not want to receive anything from?  2 How long would it take for shipping to the Lancaster PA area ? Or can you put some kind of shipping estimate on the order page just to give an idea how long you should expect to wait to have the album delivered .  3 Can I specify more then 1 genre if I order a multi month subscription ? The dropdown only allows 1 choice .  4 If i order the package with a tshirt is there anyway to select which band I would or would not like to receive ?  This does look interesting and I most likely will order something once i get paid but just want to make sure I wont be wasting my money ( hope that part doesnt sound bad).

Foofighters,33o3am,GrahamCracker00,7,Fri Apr 24 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"To add a bit of context, Jim Vance is one of DC's NBC anchors and he is sort of semi-retiring by stepping down from the 11:00 news. Jim is absolutely hilarious and does not mince words. He has something for everyone. The model footage is a few years old as George Michael has passed on and I don't think Susan Kidd is with NBC 4 anymore, but it remains part of Jim's legacy."

My first interaction with him I needed him to unlock a door and he told me he only spoke Spanish..in English. After I got what I needed from the room we left and he told everyone that I bullied him into opening the door.   Now we give each other the squinty eyed ""I'm watching you"" look.   And yes...after discovering where my desk was he did try to steal my coffee cup."

Foofighters,33dgc8,PapaGator,8,Tue Apr 21 22:35:00 2015 UTC,"Each track is going to have a different vocalist like how Probot was. You might dislike this song, but love the rest of the album. I don't dig this song cause I don't like Lamb Of God, but I love Fear, Clutch, Dead Kennedys, Corey Taylor's voice, Alkaline Trio, and others on the album. So who knows. Maybe you'll end up loving the album over all.   Also, all the bands you listed are fantastic, who I'm all really into."
Foofighters,33dgc8,mattrva,5,Wed Apr 22 03:28:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll definitely give the album a shot. If it's like this song it won't be my cup of tea and that's alright. Fear and Dead Kennedys are killer so hopefully we can see sounds more like those bands.

These were recorded by Audacity, so they're in the WAV format. They take up a lot of space on an iPod or other mp3 player. If you want them to be smaller, you can convert them to mp3 files here.

A reminder too from your friendly neighborhood mod that we absolutely do not allow download links to official releases here on /r/foofighters. I've let it slide a couple times, simply deleted the post/comment, but will be grounds for a ban from here on out. Please support the band, or check out any of the (now working!) links in our Discography Wiki.   EDIT The mods have decreed this is allowable!! :)"

I think we are a really positive community around here and everyone just wants to enjoy some good music. I've yet to see any angry disagreements on opinions about certain topics like favorite albums. It's all just sharing each person's own opinion and reasoning, and it's really refreshing to have a community like that on reddit, even though the fact that everyone here loves the topic kind of easily facilitates that attitude."

Especially cuz the songs are not available in a more accessible format. AND in this case many folks literally CAN'T buy this/support the band.   Demos, live stuff, and streaming links are all awesome. It's more of the ""Here are songs available in digital stores and on CDs, for free"" stuff we're looking to avoid here. If you REALLY want B-sides, you're gonna find 'em pretty quick somewhere online. We just don't wanna be one of those places necessarily. Plus we have the updated wiki now with streaming links so y'all can at least hear the entire discography!  And I'll be adding a rules section later this week, just to help clarify/de-clutter the sub. Thanks for the suggestions everybody! :) and a major thank-you to /u/DOMAN127 for the rip!"

Foofighters,33542c,kazman101,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:13:31 2015 UTC,/u/fftamahawk009 was the one who wrote that warning. I also messaged the entire mod team asking them to add a rules section to the sidebar so that the policy is more than just hearsay and so that it's fully explained if there are any exceptions. I just didn't want you to cause yourself to get banned without knowing that this was a rule since the mod said this will be grounds for banning from here on out.

The owner apologized and said that something goes wrong and someone gets the short end of the stick every year. I guess it was my turn. The only other store in the city that actually did have copies opened at 4 am, so that would have been near impossible for me to reasonably do that. I did get the Metallica cassette though, so that's nice."

Foofighters,333hxt,joshkg,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Well he may have taken breaths that were carefully placed and edited out well. They recorded on tape but there's still ways to reduce the sound of breaths using various mic techniques and volumes and pop filters and stuff. And just moving your mouth away from the mic.   He didn't necessarily do the entire thing in one breath, but one take possibly   I'm going to listen now to see if it sounds obviously spliced together if you listen close enough.   It is very clean. I hear one point that sounds like it could be him trying to enter in right after an initial recording but not that distinctly and I hear one point that sounds like he had a moment for a breath and took one but they minimized the sound. Also not distinct. Hard to say.   There really isn't a lot of room for a breath, it's very continuous but I found two break points, one of which might support you and one of which might support me. This is the next important question from foo fighters history for Dave to answer"

Especially Fenway park in July, which I'm super pumped for and expecting to be their next DVD release!"
Foofighters,32tk3e,motherbread,3,Sun Apr 19 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking that too, but I'm hoping they at least throw it in their rotation of covers. That would be cool about the dvd, though. Probably either the Fenway or wrigley shows."
Foofighters,32tk3e,owlsrule143,2,Sun Apr 19 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"they did already play at Wrigley though, even though they're doing it again.  But Fenway is ""America's Most Beloved Ballpark"" which would make the most sense for ""Sonic Highways, Musical Map of America"" tour and they're doing two nights in a row at fenway.   last time they did that? Wembley. Give them an unforgettable experience one night, get used to the stage and the place and acoustics, and then next night give everyone an unforgettable experience while also being comfortable with the stadium and record it so we LITERALLY can't forget it.   weird that they're playing Wembley twice again for this tour haha but no way they're doing a second DVD at the same place, and one not even in America. wouldn't make sense."
Foofighters,32tk3e,motherbread,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:46:02 2015 UTC,hahah yeah that does make sense. i was just thinking along the lines of chicago being featured on the show and since it was the first show announced and stuff there was so much hype around it. i'm sure they're just playing wembley twice because they can haha.

That's my take at least"

Foofighters,32ox9r,pwaclaw,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:03:32 2015 UTC,"Show is at an abandoned store next to the record store. That record store is a fucking closet, but has been around forever. I used to buy bootleg CDs and VHS tapes off them in the 90s for a heavy premium. Seriously thought it went out of business years ago.   There isn't much parking around there (for something like this) so get there super early if you get a ticket. There will definitely be people there rubbernecking or just hanging out which will lead to traffic problems. They say police have a plan to handle everything but it looks like it might be a clusterfuck."

We got there at 7:30 Wednesday night and we were numbers 84 and 85! Jeff, the owner of the Record Connection in Niles, was a great guy and all of the people that we camped out with for tickets were great company. As for the show, they blew our fucking minds! Seeing the Foos live in person in a tiny ass abandoned retail store was amazing. They played some old (White Limo), some new (Congregation) and even a crazy cover (Kids in America). They played for a solid hour and played like they were doing a full scale rock show. They are a class act for sure.   Here's the set they played: White Limo Arlandria Congregation Pretender Learn to Fly My Hero Big Me Alone & Easy Target Kids in America Everlong  Thank you Foo Fighters for a once in a lifetime concert!"

Foofighters,32q9k0,ricker182,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:21:09 2015 UTC,I think Gary Clark Jr. is opening for them. I think you should be safe for at least an hour late.    My guess is there will be another opening act as well.

Foofighters,32q9k0,apaeter,2,Wed Apr 15 23:50:51 2015 UTC,we once showed up to a 7 pm show around 7:45 and the Foos were already playing ... so I'd be careful.
Foofighters,32q9k0,RJB6,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:33:08 2015 UTC,I would find out when the venue curfew is (probably early because of the 4pm start) and then try and arrive roughly 3 hours beforehand.

Foofighters,32kpwg,apaeter,2,Tue Apr 14 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Wow I forgot about that one. I don't think they stopped doing ""dumb"" stuff. Look at any recent video and it's obvious they haven't lost their sense of humor. They also did Keep It Clean in response to WBC during the WL tour. When I saw on the ESPG tour they also had Rammi do a triangle solo.  I think this stuff just isn't as documented as doing a scheduled appearance on a talk show. Usually when they're on a talk show, they're promoting the most recent album, and when they're not doing that they're on tour."
Foofighters,32kpwg,apaeter,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"hehe, agreed: they're still fun, just more refined now.

That crazy (awesome)!"

I'm just gonna play the chorus and fuck it everybody probably prefers that anyways right?!  A distinctly Dave kind of humor in performance.   Edit: I commented from memory before watching it. I guess I remembered wrong. He does know the song well and sings a lot of it.

Foofighters,32j5vf,owlsrule143,2,Wed Apr 15 02:28:08 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure nobody knows it as Derek and the Dominos. Eric Clapton's version is more famous. I didn't even know it was a cover until just now.
Foofighters,32j5vf,k_pressley,3,Wed Apr 15 05:17:31 2015 UTC,Clapton was in Derek & the Dominos and continued to play Layla after he left
Foofighters,32j5vf,owlsrule143,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:25:15 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of Derek and the Dominos so.. TIL again. Is the version I know different than the one released under that band name? Or did they just write it together but never release until his solo career?  fuck it, to the google machine I go."
Foofighters,32j5vf,k_pressley,3,Wed Apr 15 05:33:40 2015 UTC,"Layla is on the record Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. It was the band's only record so that's why it's more popular by Clapton himself than the actual band.   Clapton also performed Layla acoustically quite often and that's exclusive to him and his solo career, but the band version was released in 1970 with the record."
Foofighters,32j5vf,owlsrule143,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:36:19 2015 UTC,"intersting lol. yeah i just finished googling before I came back here to read your comment. I guess the version I know was released on that album under their name, but wasn't even popular until Eric Clapton became a household name, and now it's regarded as the defining rock n roll love song, and one of the generally greatest rock songs of all time.   I was obsessed with this song when my dad told me the story of it and showed it to me when I was in middle school. This was my favorite song for quite some time, although eventually I got sick of hearing it several times per day every day. LOL. Listening now, after years of letting it rest, I can't get enough of it."

The unplugged version doesn't do much for me other than spur the memory of the original song, and provide a calmer and softer perspective of the song that is interesting and worth listening to but.. not preferable to me. what do you prefer about it? :)"

Foofighters,32b0bg,PenniesAreUseless,2,Sun Apr 12 16:05:36 2015 UTC,Wow. Wasting Light was the record that took me from casual fan to hardcore. It was the first foos record that came out after I started listening to them regularly. Gosh I remember getting home from high school on release day giddy to download it and it was the sound track to the rest of my sophomore year of high school. good times.
Foofighters,32b0bg,8-Bitz,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:16:02 2015 UTC,Damn. I'm old. Sophomore year of high school was definitely One By One for me.
Foofighters,32aeqj,JesusTouchedMyDick,3,Sun Apr 12 01:17:46 2015 UTC,I've always really liked There is Nothing Left to Lose. I would recommend checking this one out for sure.
Foofighters,32aeqj,V_Seven,6,Sun Apr 12 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"'The Color and the Shape' is definitely their best album. Since you've heard the debut, you should start from there."
Foofighters,32aeqj,Monkeymack,4,Sun Apr 12 03:14:26 2015 UTC,"To me, this is one of their heavier album next to Wasting Light. That's why I love this album so fucking much!"
Foofighters,32aeqj,er404,2,Sun Apr 12 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"All of them. But I am just a fan. Try their Greatest Hits album. If there is a song that really resonates with you, then listen to that album first. Wasting Light and Sonic Highways are the two most recent and will not have any songs on their Greatest Hits."
Foofighters,32aeqj,kurlythemonkey,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:49:16 2015 UTC,I agree I love every album but In Your Honor is my favorite because it has most of my favorite songs

Foofighters,32aeqj,crooked_vulture13,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:13:09 2015 UTC,One by One is my personal favorite.
Foofighters,32aeqj,TaylorLeprechaun,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:03:48 2015 UTC,"I like them all in their own ways...but There is Nothing Left to Lose is probably my fave. Whole album is great, but the first 5 or 6 tracks...man.   Generator....generator...generator. Yeah."
Foofighters,32aeqj,Gedwyn19,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"There is Nothing Left to Lose is by far their best and most perfect album. It's a real standout, even though Everlong, My Hero, and Monkey Wrench (from The Colour and the Shape) are really energetic and memorable and just awesome, I think the album overall is not quite as mature and interesting.   There is Nothing Left to Lose has the best guitar work and most interesting musical signatures and such of all their albums while also just having a really well produced sound. Dave recorded the vocals for the entire album sitting down, so it's so relaxed you can just feel it, even though he still manages to scream pretty intensely on Breakout and Stacked Actors, and get a lot of energy into the music.   All the guitars on it are done by Dave and it's the most Dave sounding. it's just perfection, and the drums with Taylor are fresh and still influenced by Dave yet distinctly Taylor. The album overall feels fresh and has some really great band chemistry that you can just feel. Everything flows effortlessly and fits together perfectly.   Generator is a great song. Learn to Fly and Next Year are hit singles, although I feel that the album's greatness isn't just in that.   The Colour and the Shape is fucking great but songs like Hey, Johnny Park and Doll, and See You are not career spanning foo fighters songs, because they were before the band really developed fully. There is Nothing Left to Lose is the perfect balance of freshness and prime creative years while also being developed and mature as a band, lyrically as well.  I think Foo Fighters albums are all perfection other than One by One and Wasting Light, and Sonic Highways is perfect except for What Did I Do?/God as my Witness, but TINLTL just stands above the rest. I think it's the one album that you can't possibly take a view of ""Foo Fighters are just a mediocre rock band who write very good catchy and fun songs. great to see live, fun to listen to, but not a standout band in music history"".  Those critics can shut up when it comes to this album. Even if they like Foo Fighters but think they're mediocre in the grand scheme of music history, TINLTL just is amazing. the dynamics, the songwriting, the chemistry, the freshness, the energy, real energy, not just ""turn up the volume and call it energy"". It's flawless.   Btw, Wasting Light is a very good record on the whole, I just think it has 3 major duds on it, so I don't think it's their best among the rest of their work. You really can't go wrong with Foo Fighters. Even One by One, generally considered their worst, has about 6 excellent songs out of 12, and the rest are still decent, just not as memorable as a lot of their other songs."

Foofighters,329sxn,bakin25,4,Sat Apr 11 21:55:33 2015 UTC,Only one I ever went to was in St Louis back in 2011 at the Scottrade Center. It was Foo Fighters with Rise Against opening. Dave rocked it for a 3 hour set and it was awesome. At the end of the main set they went backstage and were shown on camera. Dave indicated he would do 1 more song then Taylor said 2 so dave was like ok 2 songs but then Taylor indicated 3. This repeated until they got to 9.  The hour of Rise Against was a bonus!.   Only time will tell whether the Wrigley Field show i'm going to will top it.
Foofighters,329sxn,xilonian,5,Sat Apr 11 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"Lucky enough to have seen the Foo's 13 times. My favorite was in Connecticut in 2004 or 2005. We were able to get right up front. They opened with In Your Honor. Before the first note was played, the band was behind a large screen that hid them from view. The screen lifted the moment before Dave belted out the first line ""Can you hear me"". Later in the show, he got into a screaming contest with the audience and he was so loud I honestly thought the roof was going to collapse. They also had their most badass stage setup then. The whole back of the stage was full of old prop Marshall amps and speaker cabs."

Foofighters,329sxn,FooArchive,2,Sun Apr 12 14:18:50 2015 UTC,"Enjoyed the Wembley show watching it back on DVD loathed every minute I was there for multiple reasons - I'd bought seating tickets in the pre-sale which ended up being behind the stage because the ""in the round"" performance it was billed as got pulled, as a result the band turned and faced us just once (for the shortest song in the set). It was the first night we'd ever left my baby Son in somebody else's care & I was so underwhelmed I'd much rather have been there to put him to bed."

DOA is actually my second or third favourite Foo video (after LRtR and/or White Limo). It's so weird I love it."

THING1&2: *minds blown*     BONUS: my all time favorite meme ever and i've been far too long on the internets to know this one's just fucking awesome :D"
Foofighters,31x627,GetReady4Action,6,Wed Apr 8 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"I like something from nothing, and what did I do... The rest of em don't do much for me.   Still SUPER pumped to see them in Calgary later this year, and thinking about working on Vancouver tickets to catch GCJr as well."
Foofighters,31x627,cousin_franky,2,Thu Apr 9 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"Can't wait for the show in Calgary! I didn't know Gary Clark Jr. was in Vancouver though, that'd be fucking sick to see."
Foofighters,31x627,jedjack,2,Thu Apr 9 01:17:00 2015 UTC,Yeah Van and a bunch of other west coast (US) cities.
Foofighters,31x627,cousin_franky,4,Thu Apr 9 01:44:12 2015 UTC,Subterranean and I Am a River are actually two of my favs.
Foofighters,31x627,Powerstars,3,Sat Apr 11 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Some songs could have used some reworking, but yes, I'm still liking it."
Foofighters,31x627,Monkeymack,3,Wed Apr 8 21:48:05 2015 UTC,I'm liking it more now than just after its release.
Foofighters,31x627,yoduh4077,2,Thu Apr 9 20:46:31 2015 UTC,Yep - not on heavy rotation like it was (and heavy rotation lasted longer than most albums do) but still diggin it.
Foofighters,31x627,Gedwyn19,2,Wed Apr 8 23:47:34 2015 UTC,"I still dig it.  I haven't been playing it much at all for the last month or two, but I heard Congregation on Alt-nation at the gym a couple nights ago and I was singing right along zero fucks given as to who saw me jamming out.  :)"
Foofighters,31x627,Bungie,2,Thu Apr 9 02:17:39 2015 UTC,"I like most of the songs and love something from nothing so, sure."
Foofighters,31x627,Caboose119z,2,Thu Apr 9 03:53:49 2015 UTC,"I love it, it's my second favorite foo record behind Wasting Light"
Foofighters,31x627,comiclover1377,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly not sure why this is the case, but I pretty much like the songs in order they were released. Was in NOLA last week and it was totally fucking amazing to visit Preservation Hall and see a show there. All I could hear in my head (when there wasn't other music present) was In the Clear."
Foofighters,31x627,fugawii,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:39:37 2015 UTC,It's pretty mediocre in hindsight aside from 'I am a River.'  The show was so much better than the record.
Foofighters,31x627,hajisquickvanish,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:58:09 2015 UTC,I wasnt all that into it as first but its really grown on me (except subterranean)

Foofighters,31xz73,yoduh4077,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"in and around San Francisco   Are you seeing them in Mountain View, too?"
Foofighters,31xz73,yoduh4077,2,Thu Apr 9 21:25:40 2015 UTC,Yup! I go to a local high school.
Foofighters,31xz73,yoduh4077,2,Fri Apr 10 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"Killer! See you there!    Well, probably not, but you know. XD"
Foofighters,31xz73,UniformRecon,2,Fri Apr 10 00:39:44 2015 UTC,Why probably not?

Foofighters,31vlp9,joegunch,2,Wed Apr 8 14:37:31 2015 UTC,No extra footage of the 9:30 Club. The D.C. stuff is just the recording of TFATF.
Foofighters,31vlp9,TerrenceTheV,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:08:27 2015 UTC,rats. Thanks for the answer though.
Foofighters,31vlp9,nova_mike,2,Wed Apr 8 16:40:53 2015 UTC,anything on the Richmond show?
Foofighters,31vlp9,nova_mike,2,Fri Apr 10 00:12:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm surprised they haven't released more footage from the show. On the FooFightersLive forum, fyi, there's a torrent of a HQ recording of the band's set, Trouble Funk and Don't Need Its."
Foofighters,31vlp9,laboulaye22,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:40:04 2015 UTC,i might be an idiot but i can't find this.  i tried using the search feature on the foofighterslive.com forum.  can you point me towards a specific link?
Foofighters,31sxwr,clothesguy18,9,Tue Apr 7 22:33:52 2015 UTC,When would Dave have time to record?  I kind of really need this
Foofighters,31sxwr,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,5,Wed Apr 8 00:51:12 2015 UTC,He could have arranged to be near QOTSA on one of their tours and asked John Paul Jones to meet them at a studio near them . Kind of like how they did sonic highways and record parts around the country /world.
Foofighters,31sxwr,mrjaguar1,2,Wed Apr 8 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"Well it could just be in preparation for an album later this year/early next year, I'm sure they will have some ideas and just go into the studio once the Sonic Highways tour is over in October.  QotSA are taking a break for a while,  Josh Homme is working on Eagles of Death Metal and another Desert sessions album which he said in an interview is best done late in the year when its a bit cooler. But its a very promising sign for a new album."
Foofighters,31sxwr,Senior1292,3,Wed Apr 8 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he'd have a few weeks some time this year? The website shows no dates for this month,fingers crossed."
Foofighters,31sxwr,DarthReilly,3,Wed Apr 8 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it wouldn't take long to record his drums and backup vocals. That could be done in a few days, right?"
Foofighters,31sxwr,ChewyJustice,2,Wed Apr 8 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"Even so, they still need to write..."
Foofighters,31sxwr,GetReady4Action,8,Wed Apr 8 06:59:50 2015 UTC,Dear god please. That first album was so kick ass.
Foofighters,31sxwr,0utshined,3,Wed Apr 8 01:48:40 2015 UTC,I SURE HOPE SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Foofighters,31sxwr,The_77th_orange,2,Wed Apr 8 00:47:44 2015 UTC,How long was it down?
Foofighters,31sxwr,The_77th_orange,6,Wed Apr 8 01:25:18 2015 UTC,4 years
Foofighters,31sxwr,loudassguitars,5,Wed Apr 8 02:24:22 2015 UTC,Wow.... Yeah that's definitely not just problems with the website.
Foofighters,31sxwr,loudassguitars,2,Wed Apr 8 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"I've heard Grohl may have a new lineup in mind because of scheduling conflicts with JPJ and JH. He's got 2 side-projects slated for 2016 with ""super group"" intentions that are intended for festival gigs and charity drives. Not lying, the dude is a saint! TCV maybe one of the two? Who knows! The rumor going for one group, and I'm assuming it wouldn't be for TCV is Soundgarden/Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell."
Foofighters,31sxwr,theaksy,2,Thu Apr 9 14:07:11 2015 UTC,Cornell fronting and grohl on drums would be fuckin killer.
Foofighters,31rd82,foofarley,4,Tue Apr 7 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"you know, as someone who used to consult about crowdsourcing before it became a thing and we got places like kickstarter; this is one of the things that always mystified me about music acts: crowdfunding concerts or even albums BEFORE they happened. you get to know how many people are willing to pay to see in a market; if they hit your break-even or profit numbers; BOOM! you have a show. Louis CK has been doing this for years now.     the thing is, you cant rely on Facebook or the social media platform du jour to handle this kind of transactional relationship. you need to have direct access to your fans. and it's not just the handling of names, emails, credit/bank info. that's just ecommerce data. am talking about relating to your fans as people, not just faceless price-points in a crowd. and that's what sets the Foos apart.  that's why the get it."
Foofighters,31rd82,liza,2,Tue Apr 7 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"seriously, the oscar selfie bullshit is winning over this? another proof that the world has gone mad"
Foofighters,31rd82,Gamerhcp,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:33:10 2015 UTC,"Crowd sourcing seems like a great idea, but I think the band should be contacted prior and see if they are even available. What happens if all the tickets are sold and THEN the band finds out the date and location, and they actually can't make it? It would make them look really bad if they didn't show up. I think this only worked out because Dave is a great dude.  That's just my opinion about crowd sourcing, I voted for the show to get the webby award anyway."
Foofighters,31rd82,LastStand4me,0,Tue Apr 7 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"This sucks. Crowdfunded shows do nothing but guild-trip a band into playing a show. If they wanted to play there, they would have booked a show."
Foofighters,31rd82,ConnorFin22,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"true. so just to clarify my point: crowdfunding should be a biz strategy for the bands, not the fans."
Foofighters,31s8j0,SuperVan25,10,Tue Apr 7 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"Everything was going fine until they decided to vote for the title and a bunch of people not taking it seriously voted for ""Fresh Pots""..."
Foofighters,31s8j0,Arsid,4,Tue Apr 7 21:18:07 2015 UTC,I like that name though...
Foofighters,31s8j0,The_77th_orange,3,Wed Apr 8 01:38:02 2015 UTC,Ditto. Why not name it that?
Foofighters,31s8j0,yoduh4077,7,Wed Apr 8 02:44:03 2015 UTC,It's a joke and I assume they want something serious. I don't see a problem though.
Foofighters,31s8j0,The_77th_orange,2,Wed Apr 8 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know why it can't be 'Fresh Pots'. I voted for that, I really thought it suited as an album title..."
