If they said that they can't, even with a good reason (like they have class, or made plans already with family, etc.) he'd send very passive aggressive texts as followups.  Things like: ""Well, I guess maybe next time you need off, I'll have to reconsider."" ; ""Why spend money with your friends when you can make money instead?"" ; ""You're making me regret letting you have X-Mas eve off, even tho it's one of your normal work days.""  Thing was tho, this mostly just happened if you said yes to him once before when he requested, but then said you couldn't another time. That's when I decided to tell every new hire that if he asks you to work when you're not supposed to, no matter what, just say you can't, else he'll think he can always ask you in the future and you will be forced to do it."

texts,36w4mz,Tomf1sh,1 point,Fri May 22 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"Don't worry OP, I love you really <3  [Being pedantic though, the comment analogy was misleading. My ""complaint"" wasn't that you were sharing your opinion (which is obviously fine), but that you were misusing the subreddit, squeezing it into a subreddit more about conversations. It was a text only in form, and more of a quirky observation in substance. Like taking a photo of an inspirational quote and posting it in /r/pics instead of /r/quotesporn. Using a comment to share an opinion is far from misuse in the same way]"

She had mentioned that her boyfriend is in a cult or something a few times. She moved in four houses down and then starts flipping out about her boyfriend finding out that she has male friends. I never considered her a friend as much as I considered her a co-worker, but whatever, who cares. Then she said her boyfriend was going to kill her and myself. Have not contacted or heard from her since but saw her outside my place today and she said the same crazy shit: ""My boyfriend will kill you if you rat me out"". Bizarre."

texts,36b70c,MilkVetch,-3,Mon May 18 02:26:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is everywhere. FDA requires it be put on the menu. Here, in Michigan (and I've seen it it many other areas) all that is required is that it be somewhere on the menu. It's often a starred menu item, as with eggs and steaks, which leads you to the key at the bottom: Consuming raw or undercooked meat or poultry greatly increased you risk of foodbourne illness. That's verbatim, but I think in this case, you're right about them being to ask their server. They probably assumed it was cooked a certain way (in my club we serve everything medium rare unless specified) and didn't bother to check with the server. We serve the same dish and I always ask people I don't recognize if they are okay with a raw beef dish."

Plot of article  Fifty Shades of Grey:       Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington with her best friend Katharine ""Kate"" Kavanagh, who writes for their student newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate persuades Ana to take her place and interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, an incredibly successful and wealthy young entrepreneur in Seattle. Ana is instantly attracted to Christian, but also finds him intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview asking questions about his personal life and relationships and leaves Christian's office believing that it went badly. Ana tries to console herself thinking the two of them will probably never meet again. However, she is surprised when Christian appears at Clayton's, the largest independent hardware store in the Portland area, where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to go along with her article about him. Christian leaves Ana with his phone number. Later that day, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend José Rodriguez.

texts,2mb7cj,jansc7,4,Fri Nov 14 19:24:15 2014 UTC,"The difference between cocky and confident is mostly that cocky tends to based on your perception of yourself in relation to other people, whereas confident is self-contained and doesn't need external affirmation.  A cocky man will see a woman he wants to talk to and think ""I'm the best looking guy here, she can't say no"". A confident man in that situation will have feelings more like ""I'm an attractive person with a lot of positive qualities, there's no reason I shouldn't try and start a conversation"". It seems like a subtle difference, but it actually comes from two entirely different ends of the self-esteem spectrum. You see the evidence in what happens when they're rejected - the cocky man will likely respond with some kind of sour grapes anger or insult (""whatever, I didn't want to talk to you anyway""), whereas the confident man will likely handle the situation a lot more tactfully (""ah, I see; well, good to meet you, have a nice night"").  The reason for the drastic difference is that cocky is actually the product of a low self esteem - they may or may not believe what they're saying (that is, to continue my example, they may actually think they're the best looking guy in the room, or they may just be saying it), but either way it's a self-worth that's built on their standing in relation to other people. Confidence, however, is based on a healthy self esteem - it's a belief in the sufficiency of your own skills and attributes for whatever the task at hand is. A cocky person will strive to be better than other people, and will become envious or put others down if they feel threatened by them. A confident person will strive to be the best they can be, and will instead admire or seek advice from people that achieve things they haven't."
