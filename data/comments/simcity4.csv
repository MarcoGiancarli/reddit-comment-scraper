During the installation process, you were given an option to increase the commute times that Sims are willing to endure from the measly 20 minutes that is the vanilla default to up to 2 hours. Forget about the easy, medium and hard difficulty that you pick at the start of the game, this is where the real difficulty standards are set. How your sims use your road network is also significantly altered, for the better, as they will no longer seek the shortest distance for their commutes, but instead the fastest route."

simcity4,3cke1v,wiscsimonson2,5,Wed Jul 8 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"What are some of the best beginner mods?   I'm not sure there are such, as they mostly improve game mechanics without changing them much (For example, adding tramways, more realist traffic and building growth, but you'll never get stuff like limited ground resources, weather or anything that you could expect in mods for, say, Cities:Skylines).  You can still start by downloading lots, which are basically zonable/ploppable buildings that expand your city's variety or provide cheaper energy/water. It's fairly easy, as long as you carefully read what their dependencies are (SC4Devotion now has a grouped dependency download feature which is very promising).   How are mods installed/activated without the Steam Workshop?   Simcity 4 never relied on the Steam Workshop, you have to download your mods manually and put them in your Documents/Simcity 4/plugins folder. It can be pretty much of a hassle sometimes, but you'll be greatly rewarded in the end!  EDIT: Oops, I forgot some links, silly me.

simcity4,3cg2vq,Slickaleka,3,Tue Jul 7 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"Simply put, you can't. Solar usually unlocks before Nuclear, but it's obscenely expensive, both monetarily and space wise.  Wind is the least polluting, but just as expensive and uses even more space.  You could go for Natural Gas, the lower capacity means you could spread the pollution thinly over a larger area.  There's also some community Power Plants like Geothermal and Clean(er) Coal, but these have their drawbacks. I did up a Spreadsheet comparing the ones I've got installed, I'll have a look for it when I get home.  However, by the sounds of things you're on the cusp of unlocking Nuclear anyway. Better to stay the course. Providing better civil services, like good healthcare, policing, fire protection and transport can easily counteract the negative effect Pollution has in the Mayor Rating. Parks are also excellent in reducing Air pollution at a cost, Plazas are pretty awful at it."
simcity4,3cg2vq,Slickaleka,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:33:46 2015 UTC,Thanks. I've been building a few small parks and lots of big plazas.
simcity4,3cg2vq,saltyseahag69,2,Wed Jul 8 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Don't build the power plants near each other, and don't build them near industrial plants. I steer away from the dirty industry entirely by raising taxes on the dirty industry to 20 and lowering the high tech and other to like 3, wait for the lots to come in then put them back to 7. They pollute too, but not as much and if you don't build gigantic freaking industrial parks then you shouldn't accumulate such a bad pollution. If all else fails, air purification plant mod."
simcity4,3cg2vq,saltyseahag69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:35:34 2015 UTC,Good advice. In the newer city I do have giant freaking industrial parks with three oil power plants all right next to each other connected to the industrial zoning. I've never really messed with hiking up tax for industry because I didn't want to discourage new business. But I will try those tactics to keep the air more clean.

simcity4,3br9cc,FromOuterSuburbia,10,Wed Jul 1 17:06:58 2015 UTC,I never got the whole dislike of Wren insurance... I like that building. It just shows up on so many different tile types that you see it fucking everywhere.
simcity4,3br9cc,SquishedPeter,2,Wed Jul 1 17:15:42 2015 UTC,I agree it's not that bad but for some reason when I want to make a 4x4 CO grid  for a business district they just pop up everywhere.

simcity4,3br9cc,willmaster123,2,Wed Jul 1 20:53:01 2015 UTC,They need to have a way of making it so certain building types don't stack up against each other like that. Maybe a mod that makes it so certain buildings can only be built at a certain distance away from each other.

simcity4,3bno6g,jocap,3,Tue Jun 30 17:57:35 2015 UTC,Post a photo of your fix? This always drives me crazy.
simcity4,3bof3d,hippiechan,4,Tue Jun 30 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"This may just be me, but the way I do it is so:  1.Zone more residential than commercial at the start; they're not educated enough to use it. Don't go crazy with industry either; keep it nearby, but not too close (for pollution). Zone 3x10 for a city block, but don't force the city to be a perfect grid; just go with the flow of rails and roads.  2.Plan your roads system ahead of time so you don't demolish many building when traffic picks up.  3.Check RCI often to know what is demanded.  4.Don't use water until population reaches 1500-2000. Use a water pump instead of water tower.  5.Give education and clinics at 2000 population mark, but only in the center of town; not everyone will fit within the range.  6.Zone medium density at around 3000+ population, but don't re-zone everything unless you have jobs to support them (Begin commercial expansion).  7.Raise taxes on dirty industry to 20% when population is over 5000. Make sure a large portion of the city has access to education before doing so.  8.DON'T USE A LANDFILL, BURN THE GARBAGE FAR AWAY FROM RESIDENTIAL. Recycle as well.  9.If budget allows, put fire and police stations in at 8000-10000 population. Again, not everyone will be covered.  10.Watch RCI for higher density zoning when it's desired.  11.Have parks within the area to raise desirability.  12.Use one-way-streets when traffic becomes an issue.  13.Keep your main city with high density. Let neighboring cities have medium to low to keep demand in check.  14.Use subways and highways when commute times become too long (also due to traffic). Only do so if you have the funds.  15.Keep pollution low by instituting city ordinances.  16.SAVE THE GAME BEFORE MAKING LARGE CHANGES TO THE CITY.  That pretty much sums up my experience with the game. Hope it helps!"
simcity4,3bof3d,Mr_Bluescreen,4,Wed Jul 1 16:54:25 2015 UTC,High-Density doesn't really occur until you have the population density and budget to maintain it. Business Growth will reach max demand when you have over 100k people with a good mayor rating with many services and high traffic congestion. The biggest problem is high commute time and lack of jobs when you are in high density mode. It becomes a problem because people abandon your city and causes a recession. Your industrial areas need to be in manufacturing + hightech mode as well.
simcity4,3bof3d,kevalry,3,Wed Jul 1 15:18:34 2015 UTC,"I usually plot some random residential and commercial zones, with some moderately distanced industry for good measure. Then I connect them up using roads.  The specific details don't matter, don't even bother getting everything right. I find that any mistakes I make early on easily lead to weird and unique road/city planning, which gives each city its unique charm.  I used to plan everything out; grids, zones, services, roads; but then I realized that making beautiful cities isn't about good planning. Rather, it's good problem solving.  For example, when my city needs industry, I just zone some more in a blank spot and connect with a road. Then I fix any traffic problems along the way. This results in a very natural, unplanned look and tends to give a very built-up and infrastructure-dense core that is common in many cities."
simcity4,3bof3d,calvss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Many North American cities are indeed well-planned which results in a grid-like aesthetic, which may be beautiful sometimes. I just have a bias for unplanned cities. As they say, whatever floats your boat."
simcity4,3bof3d,calvss,2,Sat Jul 4 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'll offer my two cents on building aesthetic cities, but FYI it does sorta go against the grain. I read it on this subreddit here, but the way I now build my cities is to build it as a real city would grow: Start at some good location for a city (excellent harbor, good river crossing, crossroads of two roads etc.). Next, don't plan your city ahead (an airport will go here, a port there etc). Build stuff where it is needed, as it is needed. It doesn't make sense to leave a plot of prime real estate empty for a highway that will be built in the future. And don't be afraid to build over stuff, that's how it happened in real life. If you practice all this stuff enough you'll get more organic feeling cities that have more history to them. Now, if your looking for cities with beautiful symetrical grids then you should ignore this. But this is what I do for most of my cities now and I like it.  If this interests you I'd suggest going over to /r/worldbuilding. They're pretty friendly and they offer a lot of good advice."
simcity4,3bof3d,No_name_Johnson,-2,Thu Jul 2 00:56:22 2015 UTC,Schools and an airport or seaport will definetly help your city grow.

I usually use the weaknesspays cheat code to keep me out of debt as i construct. It all looks great, biggest city of mine is Las Vagina with the mayor, Miss.Clit. i started it as a joke, then the city grew beyond what i thought and i saw my first ever sky scrapers in the game.

simcity4,39s62e,unixlover,2,Sun Jun 14 15:41:22 2015 UTC,It's awesome! The airport seems badly placed though. I think you can move it else where and make a larger space for the airport like outskirts of the city and decorate that nicely.
simcity4,39s62e,Slickaleka,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:04:16 2015 UTC,I plan to - it was a placeholder for now but I'm using an airport mod and making a huge one a few city tiles away. I just need to think of something to fill the space.

simcity4,39adgi,Bufudyne43,8,Wed Jun 10 11:58:53 2015 UTC,"Probably not. But you can copy the files from the My Documents/SimCity 4 folder on your old computer to your flash drive, then install the game on your new computer and then copy the files from the flash drive to the same location on the new computer."
simcity4,39adgi,DeadMenTattleNoTales,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:16:09 2015 UTC,This is probably the easiest option.
simcity4,39adgi,Shaggyninja,2,Wed Jun 10 12:51:19 2015 UTC,Highly doubtful as the installer creates directories specific to your machine.   All you need however is your save files and plugins from my documents.   Copy them to a flash and move them back to the new machine after a fresh install. Alternatively if you have the Steam version you can back it up through the games properties menu.
simcity4,39adgi,notoriousmoonman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no.  You'll need to reinstall the game on your new computer.  After that, you can take your plugins and regions folders and copy those to your new computer via flashdrive and those will work just fine in the new game."
simcity4,398m86,theperiodictable,2,Wed Jun 10 01:18:40 2015 UTC,Gorgeous! You should make use of the curve pieces they give you - makes for less jagged turn points.
simcity4,398m86,jaayyne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:06:08 2015 UTC,The only problem there is that there's no room for new starter pieces. The FA pieces make it kind of difficult to get around.
simcity4,398m86,jaayyne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:00:46 2015 UTC,Actually it looks like you could make use of the FLEX Curves in the menu. Try those out and see if they work for you.  EDIT: You also don't have to use Starter Pieces for continuing an off-ramp - you can use Filler pieces for that and they work far better.

For Retail and Clientless versions (eg, CD-ROM, GOG.com, early Amazon Digital, etc), you add it to the end of a shortcut, outside of the quotation marks.

simcity4,37jezr,rochapabloricardo,3,Thu May 28 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"Well it's nearly darn impossible to have 0% congestion, and a little bit of congestion is actually fine. I don't understand what the issue with the picture is, the streets that are red/yellow can easily be upgraded to roads. The roads that are red/yellow can be upgraded to MAVE-4, TLA-3, or just an avenue. I don't get the point of the roundabout in the bottom left corner, but intersections produce congestion so if you removed it, the problem might go away.  Edit: also if you remove the spaghetti roads and replace them with wider, straight thoroughfares, that might help"
simcity4,37jezr,FromOuterSuburbia,2,Thu May 28 04:53:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm also looking for images of good practices of traffic, so if you have, please share."
simcity4,37jezr,FromOuterSuburbia,1 point,Thu May 28 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"I typically follow something derivative of the fused grid pattern in my low-density residential areas. It's a square grid of fast, wide, thoroughfares filled in with neighborhoods with limited access.  Some (of my favorite) examples: Irvine, CA; Calgary, AB; Surprise, AZ.    But for commercial areas, and higher density residential, you want a grid.  There's a reason big cities like San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY are built on grids.  It's easier for the kind of traffic they encounter, space efficient, and is pedestrian/transit friendly."
simcity4,37jezr,jaayyne,1 point,Fri May 29 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"The small red dots are actually fine. As long as you don't have long strips of red, this means your traffic is running pretty smoothly. Intersections usually get pretty congested for some reason.  If you want, you can make more roundabouts in places that are particularly red if they're an urban area.   Otherwise you shouldn't have any issues. If the rest of the streets are green you should be fine!"
simcity4,37jezr,FromOuterSuburbia,2,Thu May 28 13:58:58 2015 UTC,^ NAM multiplies the amount of congestion at intersections to simulate traffic lights
simcity4,37jezr,jaayyne,2,Fri May 29 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that! OP, there's your answer."
simcity4,37jezr,Indianaj0e,1 point,Fri May 29 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"That's a normal effect of the NAM.  It multiplies congestion around intersections to mimic traffic lights, which the game lacks in its original form.  It's an adjustable feature."

simcity4,37fqpt,frdalton,3,Wed May 27 13:18:03 2015 UTC,"I do have nam and use it. The only part of nam that i don't use is the real highway mod.  Seriously, those roads are a pain in the ass to put."
simcity4,37fqpt,frdalton,3,Wed May 27 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a royal pain to work with when it wants to be.  Have you tried the symphony part of it? It reworks the maxis highways to look more like the RHW stuff, but keeps the ease of use.  Might be worth an try.  Mind you that still doesn't help with your under highway fillers, that issue would still remain."
simcity4,37fqpt,Tarkus-OR,1 point,Wed May 27 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"Speaking as one of the main RHW developers, the biggest problem with the RHW has always been slope tolerance--that's why the pieces sometimes become a royal pain.  It's the end starters on the old static puzzle pieces that are the problem.  The problem with keeping the static puzzle pieces without the starters introduces a substantial ease-of-use issue.    I think that once the FLEX stuff is truly stable (allowing us an RHW with fewer buttons and less TABing), and we can get QuickChange up to full buildup, it's going to open the RHW to a lot of folks who found it too daunting previously."
simcity4,37fqpt,quicksilver991,1 point,Thu May 28 05:19:42 2015 UTC,I actually started w/ symphony at first but ended up deleting those road since they aren't draggable over the rivers in my region.

simcity4,37228q,Shortsonfire79,5,Sun May 24 04:35:27 2015 UTC,I do a couple things to help with crashes and they're very rare now. I think the main thing is I switched it to use only 1 CPU.
simcity4,37228q,NuggetX3,1 point,Sun May 24 04:46:25 2015 UTC,"Haha, I was partially joking.  I still get the occasional crash but it's usually because I was stupid with the transportation puzzle pieces or something.  I also get it when trying to exit to region view, saving or not, which gets pretty frustrating."
simcity4,36zzbp,FiveAlarmFrancis,6,Sat May 23 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"If you want to do region wide terraforming I'd suggest SC4Terraformer.  Here is a quick guide on it from Simtropolis.  I've only used this a couple of times, but it lets you terraform over the entire region at once without needing to do it city by city."
simcity4,36zzbp,ZoneSystem,3,Sat May 23 17:23:29 2015 UTC,Cool. I was hoping for something like this but wasn't sure if it was out there.
simcity4,36zzbp,eman462,0,Sat May 23 18:17:36 2015 UTC,The reconcile tool is what you need here. Do what you want on one tile and then go to the adjacent one. Click on reconcile and it will elevate the terrain on the border of the tile in respect to the adjacent tile.  From there you just have to be careful and delicately alter the terrain without messing too much up. If you want you can go back to the tile you started on and reconcile again to make it smoother.
simcity4,36zzbp,saltyseahag69,2,Sat May 23 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, OP is using it, but it's not always a great solution. Like you said, there's a lot of back-and-forth.  I had a pretty intensively (manually) terraformed region, and it boiled down to just a lot of back-and-forth between regions to get little bits just right. It's definitely better to not start out with reconciliation as your first step--build the mountain in the other half first, reconcile to see how close you were in altitude, raise or lower it a bit, reconcile again, etc etc. Otherwise you'll get those steep slopes that just look ugly. Usually if the difference isn't enormous it looks nice enough.  Don't forget (not so much with mountaintops, but with other features) that once you put buildings down, they'll disguise boundaries pretty well. I don't remember if trees show up on regionview, but if they do you could try that, too.  It helps if you keep bends and peaks within one region, because that disguises them a little. Rivers going perpendicular to the borders are way easier to disguise than angled ones--within reason, though, because if you make them too regular then it's obvious what you're doing."
simcity4,36xjj4,FromOuterSuburbia,3,Fri May 22 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"It seems like graphical issues, not something inherently wrong with the install or new plugins. Instead the graphics card driver may been updated over the last month so it doesn't want to play nice with SC4 anymore, or some other auto-update may have broken it. Perpahs fiddle with the settings of the video card, or revert back to a previous driver if indeed it's been updated recently."
simcity4,36xjj4,vrtxt,1 point,Fri May 22 23:38:39 2015 UTC,"Well shit... Thank you! I did update my graphics card for GTAV.  I also saw another update queued on the nVidia interface, so I'll try that out and boot up SC4.  I'll edit this comment as soon as I get it up and running.  Thanks again"
simcity4,36xjj4,Strategist01,2,Sat May 23 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, it may be because you are running at a non-standard resolution with an nvidia card that may be it. I have a GTX 750 Ti and I was unable to play at 1920x1080. Used to be able to on a GTX 460 with older drivers. Try adding '-CustomResolution:enable -r1280x1024 -w' (without quotes) into the target line of the shortcut properties box. I think you'll find most of your problems go away. You can also try out standard screen resolutions - check the options menu for what size you can enter.  Also - make sure that you are using your nvidia card and not the integrated graphics!"

simcity4,364km6,gogosago,5,Sat May 16 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone. This is a region I've been working on for a couple years now. I've tried to role-play the region as a tiny fictional state that really went in another direction among American regions after WW2. To that end, I wanted to have strong downtown areas surrounded by walkable suburban zones linked with public transit, while still allowing for automobile use on highways. When looking at the total commute share of most cities in the region, at least 50% or more rely on commuter rail or subways to commute to work. I also wanted to make it a region that incorporates some near-future technologies in energy and food production (hence the vertical farms everywhere).  Here is a preliminary mod list for those interested. Unfortunately, my mod folder has been piling up for 7 years now and I don't have access to all of the download links. In addition to these, I used BATs from the Halifax, NYC, and Paris series.  SimPEG Utopian Series - http://www.simpeg.com/forum/index.php?action=downloads;cat=10;sortby=date;orderby=desc;start=20  Simgoober Education Lots - http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1382[1]  CAM Commercial Offices - http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=950[2]  CSX Civic - National Library - http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=6[3]cobb32118   SFBT Parking Lots (One of the best filler lots, I highly recommend this) - http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1726  Also, I posted a couple shots of this same region in this subreddit 8 months ago.

It automatically multiplies congestion at all intersections, turning them all red even if they aren't congested, to simulate traffic lights, because traffic lights aren't in the original game and commute times were unrealistically short.  It's a setting that can be turned off in the Traffic Simulator Config Tool that comes with the NAM."

simcity4,35z9i2,HomerSPC,3,Thu May 14 22:04:05 2015 UTC,Intersections will have more traffic because there is more going through it.  Don't worry too much if it's one red square.  Worry if it's one red street.
simcity4,35z9i2,pasanini,3,Thu May 14 21:49:00 2015 UTC,"As a parallel to real life, a degree of congestion in any city is pretty normal. In this experiment by Peter Ritche on stock SimCity4 (i.e. no mods) congestion is terrible in every city but he's able to sustain a region of over 100,000,000.  So it depends on what you're going for. If you're building for population density, you're gonna have congestion at bottlenecks. Clever planning can alleviate it in some cases.  You could also install the Network Addon Mod. Stock road capacities are pretty low."

For smaller tile sets I like to focus on highways and mass transportation, or if it's not really needed, a nice bedroom community with low to medium density housing with all the amenities.

If you're using the newer draggable viaducts, which come in both L1 and L2 heights, there's a FLEX OnSlope under the TAB Loop for the draggable viaducts.  It won't look like an Avenue On-Slope initially, as you actually just place two of the Road/RHW-looking ones side by side, and then hook the Avenue into it (but not dragging through it), which will convert it to Avenue."
simcity4,3554m5,Tarkus-OR,1 point,Thu May 7 04:58:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I will have to read this paragraph a few more times to get it all down. I've never played with mods before and I love how much is now possible, but I'm realizing how complicated some of the options are and how difficult it can be to create something that once it's there seems so intuitive and simple.   I really appreciate your help.  Sifting through the Simtropolis or SC4 Devotion forums is really tedious and I can almost never find what I'm looking for. Reddit to the rescue."
simcity4,353818,Robin230592,5,Wed May 6 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to plan out two cities: residential, and industrial. Build a cluster of low-density residential homes in the center or near-edge of one city, and connect it to the adjacent city with an avenue. Then build medium-density industrial right on the edge of the next city (for faster commute times). When commercial demand starts to grow, build some low-density blue zones on the avenue leading to your industrial city (Sims like to shop on their way back from work). Congrats! It should be semi-functional at this point.   For a faster-growing city, you can put the industrial in the same city tile as the resi/com, but make sure they are far apart so it won't get too polluted. Build coal-fired plants for industrial areas, and wind/natural gas plants for residential.   This is very important: DO NOT BUILD SERVICES! Your city only needs power to grow at first. Once you've built up a decent income flow, then you can start adding schools, parks, fire departments, etc. to bring in the higher-wealth tiers (who not only use less services, but pay more taxes as well).  I hope this helps."
simcity4,353818,Jatoro,6,Wed May 6 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"Can you post a screenshot of your expanded budget?  It'll be of help so people can give you responses better suited to your city.  Some screenshots of your city can also help.  Here's some advice from my many years playing:   Avoid building high cost facilities, such as hospitals, large schools, and large fire departments/police stations until you actually need them. Rewards buildings don't have to be built immediately.  When the adviser says you've unlocked a building, simply click ""close"" (do not hit decline) and the building will be available for placement under the rewards tab. While dirtier power plants may seem more cost effective, wind and solar power is generally better in the long run due to no pollution. Start with water towers until you're about to build your seventh one. Pause the game, knock them all down, and build a pump.  Water towers only cost $50 per month and will provide enough water for a small village, as opposed to $350 for a water pump which is better suited for large towns/small cities. Don't expand too quickly.  You may get pestered by the adviser who says ""so-and-so needs room to expand"".  As you expand further you'll need more, or larger, facilities to cover the recently zoned areas, which can add quite a bit to your expenses.  Zone, and allow the area to develop before adding more. Don't zone high density early on.  It's extremely costly to simply zone for it, and, for residential, it will bring a lot of people who may require more services than you have.  I find it's best to start with low-density zones, and later re-zone for medium and high density when I feel that the services in the area can handle the increased population.  Also note that as you zone up, traffic will greatly increase. Don't zone for agriculture.  Unless you're specifically creating a farm-based city, it's pointless.  Farms provide virtually no tax income, employ very few people, emits large amounts of water pollution, and take up an enormous amount of space. Don't be afraid to raise taxes.  You're mayor rating might go down, but you'll make more money every month.  Just don't forget to lower them back down once your city becomes profitable.  On the flip side, don't be afraid to reduce funding to services.  Like raising taxes, it's not a popular choice, but one that can save you some money if you're in a bind. Avoid taking out loans if you're already having trouble making ends meet.  A quick $200,000 might sound great, but you'll be paying back $2,479 a month for 10 (game) years. Industrial zones are a key component for early city success.  While cities can be built without them, industrial brings in a significant amount of tax revenue early on. Keep landfills small.  The monthly cost as they become filled are very high, they produce large amounts of pollution, and can't be removed until they're empty.  Use recycling centers and ordinances to keep trash low. Play the tutorial.  If you've done that, then reset it and play again. Don't be afraid to restart a city several times until you get it right.  I've restarted cities, and entire regions, more times than I care to admit, but each iteration has been more successful than the previous one. While I don't use, or generally recommend the use of, cheat lots may be considered as a last resort.  They'll give you large amounts of money each month as long as they exist in your city.   I know this is quite a read, but I hope it helps."
simcity4,353818,spaceandtime99,3,Wed May 6 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"About the only thing I can add to this is that you can scale the amount of services in the budget. Don't pay for a power plant that's only working at 22% capacity. Cut power production to save money in the short term and extend the plant's longevity. Likewise, when you build services, adjust their budget to the level of use they're getting, or a little bit above. No point in paying for enough doctors and nurses to treat 500 patients if you've only got 25.   One of the beautiful things about SC4 is that you can adjust each individual service/utility building's budget to fit the level of use it's getting. Take advantage of that and you can trim a decent amount of fat off your city budget.   Also, use toll booths. Especially if you've only got one road between the residential/commercial and industrial areas. Make a chokepoint they all have to go through and put a toll on it. You'd be surprised how much money you can recoup that way."
simcity4,353818,tagehring,2,Wed May 6 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"What difficulty are you playing on? Start with Easy and work your way up to Medium, then Hard.   Don't overbuild services. Not only should you only build services like schools and hospitals according to the size of the population they serve, but be vigilant about controlling each facilities funding levels to just over what you need. Same applies for power plants; start with wind power and build into oil or coal plants when your population requires it.   Also, don't build services that your people won't use. You really don't need libraries, museums, or even high schools until your cities are fairly large. They can be a significant drain on your budget. When you do get them, make sure to monitor their individual budgets too.   Don't feel forced to build any services that you can't afford. People will move into your town with just roads and power. You don't even have to have water for some people to move in, so just move slowly if you need to.   Which advisor is unhappy with you?   I hope this was helpful for a beginner. If you can give more information, we can help you further."
simcity4,353818,Clearly_sarcastic,2,Wed May 6 19:25:00 2015 UTC,"Holy shit did we write you a book.   In your first city, demand is very low and you have very little money to play with. Most of your income is from residential zones. You don't need more than a fire station and a police station in your city until you start making money. You don't need the full gamut of education. 100% coverage of elementary school, with no higher education, works wonders. As basic mods to make the game more playable, try the Network Addon Mod and the SPAM (simpeg agricultural mod)  With enough population, high-density, high-wealth areas will generate more in tax revenue than you will know what to do with. That is the appropriate time to start fucking around. Highways are cost-effective in medium and high density ares. Incinerators can be built and then funded at §0 and will still incinerate trash at the cost of air pollution You can build R§ right next to dirty industry they don't really give a shit (great commute)"

I'm sure your factory worker sims don't really need good eucation or public safety just yet. Maybe when you can afford it but certainly not when all you want is that beautiful dirty industry money.   Also, in my experience, dirty industry doesn't really mind high taxes. (Not too high, but certainly not a conservative amount). Sure your advisor will complain, but they're not leaving. If they do leave, just lower it back down."

The grey concrete tiling is part of the RMIP Pack, that lets you create custom airports. Sadly, there are plenty of them, so all I can tell is that they are from one of the four main ones.  The barbed wire fencing inside the prison, is a creation designed to be used with RMIP, namely these airport security fences.  The parking lots outside the prison come from this NDEX mod. The transit ones are especially cool, as they allow you to make train/airports/stadiums/whatever better by letting you surround them with parking spaces.  The grass texture on the right side of the prison is I believe part of RMIP too, though don't quote me on it.  Lastly, the pine trees are part of some mod I can't for the life of me remember. It might have been something I got on the PEG, though some seasonal trees will do just as fine."

simcity4,32zde5,hitchmark,4,Sat Apr 18 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"I like to develop my industry along the rail lines - so I usually draw a straight-ish line, depends on the environment - I'll try to follow a river, so go around a hill etc. Once the industry gets a bit too wide for the train line, I'll branch it off and make a side line that's mostly parallel. I'll also try to place lines next to any seaports if they're available.  For my residential cities: I'll make a big loop around the zone, not make the zone too wide, and place enough station around the ring. Then I connect all the rings into the main line that goes to the industrial city. This saves on a LOT of traffic if you get your placement right. I think that out of all the traffic that went to the industrial city, ~92% was passenger rail. This gives a nice boost to realism as you don't have to place down highways until your city is much larger.  For a  dense inner city, try making a cross with your train tracks in the centre of the zone, a loop on the outside, and then connecting the cross and loop together to the main rail network going past the residential zones. Place a generous amount of stations, they are super cheap. If you don't want to demolish your established zone, a loop on the outside will suffice."

simcity4,32zde5,Marshall_Lawson,4,Thu Apr 30 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"I like to start with a 'mainline' in my regions connecting my main cities and environs (careful to avoid the infinite commuter problem, of course).  From there I try to branch it to where I need it i.e. industrial zones, Within my cities, I try to stick to the mainline (acting as a sort of commuter rail until better transportation options are available) and branch it towards the industrial areas to ship cargo.  Eventually, my railways end up relegated to mostly cargo and intercity travel, with a more condensed, efficient network to free up space for the growing cities.  Anyways! A couple of tips to make them look nicer and functional I use is to branch them out (there's a mainline and spurs that connect to it that link the different areas), try and keep it at-grade most of the time (in hilly cities it can get expensive, but it looks real nice), and try to place it in such a way it reduces crossings (like putting the rail between two roads, or between two highway lanes, or even using bridges for cars above the mainline).  Cheers, hope it helps."
simcity4,32zde5,Blaskowicz,3,Sat Apr 18 03:28:46 2015 UTC,Can you tell me a little more about the 'infinite commuter problem?'
simcity4,32zde5,Duke_UK,3,Sat Apr 18 05:12:50 2015 UTC,"At the area where four maps meet, if you have connections that are too close to the corner commuters wil travel from city to city to city etc looking for jobs."
simcity4,32zde5,No_name_Johnson,3,Sat Apr 18 06:32:27 2015 UTC,"Basically, it is possible to have commuters going to city to city without getting anywhere, eventually growing in number to be many more times the size of your region if left unchecked.  Let's say you have two small cities A and B, and a medium city called C, in your region. Like this:  AB  CC  CC  All cities are connected to each other, so it's possible to go from A to B to C to A.  The problem occurs when Sims commute from city to city. For example, 1000 Sims from, say, city A may look for jobs on city B, and commute there. Then, you play on city B, and you see 1000 Sims from city A coming to your city. There are no available jobs on city B anymore (i.e. due to a tragic meteorite strike on your industrial area) or the jobs from city C are closer to the arriving commuters than the jobs at your city. So, let's say the 1000 then go to city C to get jobs. So far so good.  What happens is that the game does not keep more than one city in memory, so the commuters do not know they come from city A originally, the game only knows ""there are 1000 commuters coming from city B to get jobs"". When you load city C, you get the 1000 inbound commuters. But, if they do not find any jobs or find that the exit to city A is closer by and there are jobs there, they may take it, and get back to city A.  There, you get 1000 citizens looking for jobs, plus 1000 citizens coming to get jobs (which are the same Sims, the game just counts them twice unknowingly).  From there, the loop may continue until a city of a thousand can have tens of thousands of its Sims going around the region, polluting a lot, congesting traffic and slowing down the game, and the problems get worse and worse as you play.  The way to solve it is to ensure there are no loops in your traffic network between cities (for example, cutting the connections between A and B in this case), which is my favorite method as it ensures it will not happen under any circumstance if you're careful and it looks really cool on the traffic map.  The other way to reduce its chance of happening is to build the connections between cities close to the middle of the border, ensuring it's harder for them to commute to other towns.  Hope it helps!"

simcity4,32pz6x,Globalscree,5,Wed Apr 15 22:02:21 2015 UTC,"The tips mentioned are good, but there are a couple other ones worth mentioning:  -Mods! NAM (Network Addon Mod) is pretty much a must-have, as it fixes a lot of problems in the original game, transportation wise. There are a couple other mods that fix small things in the game but that's the biggest one.  Power lines do not need to go parallel to zones: zones conduct power by themselves. Also it's often good to put your power plant far away from the other zones.  Parks, city connections, taxes, and rewards all can affect demand. Do you happen to have water, well funded police and fire department in your city?"
simcity4,32pz6x,Blaskowicz,3,Thu Apr 16 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"I realized this post is 6 days old after I was almost done writing, so here's my advice whether your still looking for it or not.  The tips that people are giving you regarding transportation are solid, though by the looks of the polls, it's not what is causing your current demand problem, but the current layout of your city and your transportation network will end up causing you headaches down the line so you might as well fix it early.  Right now you are using mostly streets throughout your city with a few roads. The roads that you do have are running North-South. Your city is laid out in long blocks of Res-Com-Ind zones, and those blocks are packed side to side and stacked East-West. Most of your traffic is going to be going from sims travelling from home to work (and some shopping). So, a lot of your traffic will be running East-West, but the thoroughfares that can handle the most volume in your city are running North-South, so you'll want to beef up your network running East-West.  Like I said, that's not a huge issue that's impacting you now but the other commenters are right about making sure you tackle it.  According to your polls, safety and the environment are your biggest concerns. It looks like safety is on the rise for you (maybe you just placed a PD or FD before taking the screenshot), but just double check to make sure that you've got full coverage throughout your city for both and that should get fixed up right away. Get some parks in there and plant trees everywhere. Those lots with the no road connection symbol on top? Place parks over them because they won't develop anyway (open grass, plazas, community gardens work well and look good for this). Your industry and commercial will benefit from parks too, so give them some plazas. Trees are your friends too, so get your hippy on and plant them wherever you can.  Until your sims are educated enough you won't see any clean high-tech industry. They need to be college educated, so you'll need elementaries, high schools and colleges and it will take several game years for them to become educated (Your smart sims like libraries and museums too).  When placing schools (this applies to medical facilities too), you'll want to manage their funding levels. You can adjust this through the tax menu or by using the query tool. You'll want to make sure you keep your funding level to support just more than the amount of students(or in the case of medical facilities, patients) you have and adjust as needed (your sims will tell you when they need more funds-- in fact, they won't shut up about it).  It looks like you are playing on a flat map. That's a good place to start, but once you get an idea as to how the city operates, you might want to try a map with some topography. There's no one single way to play the game, and developing a city around the topography and trying to build a realistic looking and feeling city, you'll find there is more nuance to the game than making sure you've just got all the right tiles in the right pattern on a grid"
simcity4,32pz6x,HalfTime_show,3,Wed Apr 22 14:24:19 2015 UTC,"Plan out your streets and roads as opposed to using the automatically generated streets that comes with zones.

simcity4,32h9bg,saltyseahag69,2,Mon Apr 13 23:35:36 2015 UTC,"As others said it might be as simple as changing the CPU count or use software rendering. Though note software rendering doesn't allow for HD content. At any rate a complete list of shortcut edits can be found here.   However it's far more likely the game simply doesn't recognize your graphics card, since it's an old game. Luckily you can add the card manually: How to configure SC4 to work with your new hardware.  If this all fails you might want to consult The Almost Definitive Guide to Running SimCity 4 on Windows 8. And if it's any consolation I recently installed SC4 on Win8.1 and got it running smoother than ever before."

If you're feeling adventurous you may want to install a tree mod secondly. These combined will completely overhaul the landscape.

simcity4,326xk2,long-da-schlong,2,Sat Apr 11 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm very picky about curves with RHW; as a rule I never have a highway turn or curve without using the curve pieces. I don't like how the sharp 45 degree angles look. It does lead to some logistical challenges trying to cram things into a smaller space in an urban setting.  And this one definitely grew organically. The suburban mall was the extreme north end of the city for a long time until I finally decided to build the capital district in this city (I had a couple of choices). Originally, all of that land was going to be medium and low density residential with an industrial strip along the waterfront.   Eventually I'm going to fill in the land on the other side of the river with a smaller city; no more than a core of medium density and the rest low-density streetcar suburbs with more modern cul-de-sac suburbs up on the heights."

simcity4,3243yu,Hirea,6,Fri Apr 10 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"Hi there, from my experience playing for about ten years, I can try to get all your bullet points:  *You can start a neighboring city pretty much any time you want, especially if you want to keep dirty industry or landfills out of your base town.  Garbage starts piling up pretty quickly so you could even establish a neighbor concurrently if you want to ship garbage out immediately.  I haven't really found a set population threshold to start a neighboring town.  *Shared services (like garbage) can really stimulate a city's economy, I've seem to have observed.  If I have the one water supply for the region and I'm selling to all my neighbors, I'll make a hefty income and attract more wealthy sims.  *When you're growing a city, it's definitely plausible to manage some districts differently than others.  If you want to keep dirty industry in your city, expect mostly low wealth to pop up around it, unless you invest in a bunch of trees and parks and schools.  If you want an affluent district, then definitely diversify your services with parks, libraries, police and fire.  I would recommend putting at least an elementary school in every part of your city unless you want the advisor yelling at you.  *As density in a district increases, MAKE SURE to increase your services there accordingly.  Especially if you fast forward the simulation.  Strikes would happen to me all the time because a high rise would pop up without me noticing right away, and my clinic and elementary school near by would become crippled.  Either up the funding or build a new/larger service at that point.  The types of services and quality of life parameters change more with wealth, not density."

There are 2 types of FAR at the moment, FAR-3 and FAR-2 with 18° and 27°, respectively. So FAR-2 should be the type of choice, as it is pretty close to the 30° you need :)  I think FAR-2 might be draggable-only, so there are no puzzle tiles for this type.

University Ave is an avenue and I need to be able to intersect at multiple spots with blocks, etc.   If you can find me a way to do that that looks the nicest with FAR-2 I will give you gold! :D Or anything else you'd like.

You can have one city focus more on industrial, and another on commercial, but there are benefits to having all three within a city (hi-tech industrial increases nearby commercial demand, more rewards unlocked within city, shorter commutes).  I much prefer to separate wealth by cities; have a ghetto with low wealth R and C and dirty I; a medium wealth suburb with shopping malls and a manufacturing district; etc.. You can just set the taxes for the wealth types you don't want to 20% and they won't grow."

simcity4,30igst,Indianaj0e,2,Fri Mar 27 18:29:35 2015 UTC,It's perfectly feasible to keep them separated into different cities.  It's just a little bit buggy.  You need an abundance of transportation between the two cities.  If you're using NAM highways and networks you need to look up how to set up neighbor connector pieces properly in the NAM manual.

Buying/selling utilities and garbage disposal, etc. The game nags you about this aspect rather frequently. The only thing required for high land value is a lack of pollution. That is literally it. Look at the data view for land value and see how directly it correlates to pollution. High crime and high traffic have a negative effect. Available healthcare and education have a positive effect. Certain buildings like mayoral statues and mayor's house raise land value by a fixed amount in a radius. Zone density =/= type in this game. It just means the upper limit on what size residence/building/factory can be there. Whether dirty, manufacturing or high-tech winds up there is not up to zoning but the desirability of that area to that industry and whether your labor market is sufficient (education or lack thereof). If you want high-tech industry (low pollution, high income) educate your sims (past roughly 160 education quotient in the charts), raise taxes on other industries just enough to put demand below 0 and bulldoze undesired industry to make room or create a new zone. High-tech doesn't like pollution so it needs a lot of buffer from dirty industry. Parks are helpful but definitely NOT required for high land value.   Just to prove it can be done. My latest city, Hegel: http://imgur.com/a/Te9bm  Nearly 100% high-tech industry. Low poverty. High land value nearly everywhere as you can see. Very few parks. Only using NAM (traffic mod)."

No, you can build a neighboring city with industrial or commercial and sims will commute to the neighbor city. They won't go exactly to the location in the neighbor city but they will still leave your city.    The only thing required for high land value is a lack of pollution.   This is true-ish, but low pollution doesn't mean wealthy lots will zone there.   If you look at a new city map, and look at the desirability for C$$$, R$$$ and HT industry, the whole thing will be a murky red color. The land value will be green-ish, because the land isn't polluted at all, but they still don't want to live there.   For high land value, and thus high-tech and wealthy R and C, you need the following: water, power, parks, and an educated population. The zones need to be away from pollution and for HT industry, need a good way to transport freight out of the city."

One of my professors was actually on the city planning commission of the city my university is located in. I think she was on the board that actually designed the downtown location. She gave a lecture about it and she talked how they wanted it to be pedestrian  friendly with tons of parking. Aesthetically there are really cool parts about it. There's a big square in the middle with restaurants all around. The downtown can be split right through the middle. At the south end of the axis there is a patio that overlooks the river. And the best part is that it has a couple modern style skyscrapers among the old style buildings that create a beautiful texture to the area. It's all perfect for a city of about 300,000.   Also keep in mind the density mapping in this game is slightly off. I think I achieved a population of 200,000 in a city with way more skyscrapers than Memphis which has around 600,000 people in it."

You also have the end of an avenue in your last picture going nowhere - I'd transition that to a road or a T intersection.  Otherwise it looks really nice!

simcity4,2zdhl6,iki_balam,11,Tue Mar 17 18:00:13 2015 UTC,holy shit that looks amazing.    im extraordinarily skeptical about city builders. i have sunk over 800 hours into simcity4...but these are the first screenshots ive seen of Cities Skylines that thoroughly impress me. they are like a mix of sc4 ported to unity/udk with tropico4 sprinkled ontop.    the last image looks like someone legitimately took a screenshot of sc4 and went balls out with it in photoshoppe.
simcity4,2zdhl6,trunk_slamchest,14,Tue Mar 17 19:51:07 2015 UTC,It doesn't impress me at all. I probably will never ditch SC4 for skylines... It still looks too cartoony for me and I mean just look at those unrealistic roads! NAM and RHW have raised my standards too high when it comes to roadbuilding.
simcity4,2zdhl6,schlmitty,11,Tue Mar 17 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"Back in my day, you had to use half your city tile for those RHW interchanges! I had to pave roads uphill both ways through the snow!  Youngins nowadays with their fancy new-fangled fluid water and 360º rotatable cities..."
simcity4,2zdhl6,Qazzy1122,10,Wed Mar 18 05:19:44 2015 UTC,I feel the same. I'm excited by what can be done with Cities but the asthetic is horrible compared to SC4.  I'll wait for the mods to build up before I give it a go.
simcity4,2zdhl6,LazarouMonkeyTerror,3,Wed Mar 18 09:50:16 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember is that SC4 is 10 years old, so it's no surprise that it's still winning on mods. I'm gonna wait too, but I think C:S will get to a point where making the switch makes all kinds of sense."

The arrows in the bottom left of the second photo, those go in the direction of the runway, not away from the runway. These indicate to planes that they can't land on this bit and should touch down further on.  The L and R are used in direction of travel. So the ones I can see nearer the terminal should be the other way around. Runway numbers are dictated by the direction of the runway, if the top is North then those are facing 270°. So the one at the bottom would be 27L and the one nearer the terminal would be 27R.  Edit: just realised that could be a 7 and a 3, which would be 70° and 30°"

FINAL THOUGHT(lol):it might be what sc5 should of been, but its still not a true successor to sc4...and if skylines wants to take the crown from sc4, it has 10 years of mods to catch up with. thats gonna take a long time.    otherwise, skylines will enjoy 2nd place for years to come."
simcity4,2yssmr,trunk_slamchest,21,Thu Mar 12 23:31:43 2015 UTC,"SC4 has had over a decade to mature thanks to the thriving modding community. Cities Skylines will catch up and eventually supplant SC4 (it may take a few years, but it will happen.) However, I'm sure many people will continue to play SC4 for the nostalgia and for the industrial (as opposed to cartoonish) graphics. SC4 has and will continue to age well. Perhaps one day, once SC4 has become extremely primitive, EA will open source it (don't hold your breath) and we'll have another Renaissance."
simcity4,2yssmr,BumBumiLikeBum,6,Thu Mar 12 23:39:45 2015 UTC,I hope for the day SC4 gets open sourced. Maybe a disgrunted ex-Maxis employee would do the honours ;)
simcity4,2yssmr,LazarouMonkeyTerror,4,Fri Mar 13 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"sc4 has a very eclectic graphic and art style. it's only draw back is that it is isometric. i will prolly keep playing it because i always find new ways to make things look cooler-er.  maybe its just that im alittle sad that i have to wait for skylines to catch up to sc4 because i know how long its gonna take, and id love to dive deep into skylines, but i just cant at the moment lol    the #1 thing i say to myself when i see screenshots of skylines is ""wow there is no building variety whatsoever. it all looks fake because the same building is repeated 1000x times. there is no gradual shift between zones. nothing looks realistic and it is not because of the graphics style.""    but i know that will be fixed with mods...so i just have to wait lol"

simcity4,2yssmr,drynoa,2,Fri Mar 13 09:11:44 2015 UTC,That's my thoughts on Cities as well. When the modded content drowns out those cookie cutter buildings then I'll jump in.  Does anyone know if Cities has a BAT style tool?
simcity4,2yssmr,LazarouMonkeyTerror,2,Fri Mar 13 13:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's even accessible from the main menu."

Sometimes I'll try to build parallel roads and, nope, they're actually gradually diverging or growing apart. Or I'll build a piece of highway, then want to continue on in the same direction, but nope, it will only veer off a little to the left or to the right from that point on."

It's early days for Cities and once the mods come in then I'm sure our jaws will drop but I'll still play SC4 because of all the time I have invested in my vast, vast metropolis.  It will take a few years for those mods to build up unless the modding tools are a pleasure to use."
simcity4,2yssmr,LazarouMonkeyTerror,9,Fri Mar 13 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"Except the UI is much worse.  Simcity (13) had a lot of problems, but you can't argue that the UI (everything from the icons to the themes to the building interface) wasn't great."

simcity4,2yssmr,Armi5,5,Mon Mar 23 07:45:03 2015 UTC,"I want SimCity 4 but with better graphics and a fixed simulator. Is that what this is? I've skimmed through a couple videos of it and I see that there's a highway outside the playable area with an interchange and one way in and out of the city and that turns me right off. I want to work on a big scale making regional transportation systems and it seems like the focus of this and the new SimCity is one city at a time. Am I wrong in thinking this?  Also, it looks like a fricking cartoon. Why?"

simcity4,2yuc9k,a_jackson_federalist,5,Fri Mar 13 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"I think first and foremost you need the newest NAM update because it provides you with the ability to to make diagonal roads that are not just one tile by one tile. This is essential because it allows you to make grids that are not just made out of 90 degree intersections without completing breaking the grid. Take a look at downtowns of various cities, and you'll see that while they are typically grids, they'll always be a little hint of diagonal roads running through preventing all the blocks from being perfect squares and rectangles.  Subways should be used sparingly. NYC has by far the most thorough subway system in the nation, and unlike the cities that a lot of SC4 players build, it doesn't have lines going down every avenue. Look at subway and train systems from various real world cities and metro areas to give yourself a better understanding of how to use these systems in a realistic manner.  Finally, look at the topography of major cities. cities are often build on low lying ground near where multiple rivers meet, or where a river meets a major body water. Look at how highways and bridges negotiate major bodies of water and rivers. One of the big constraints that you have to keep in mind with SC4 is that you cannot build diagonal rivers. This means that you really need to keep in mind where you're going to build your bridges when you layout your landscape.  Realistically, a lot of America's metro areas are giant grids, but only the major roads keep on running for really long distances. I would just look at maps of the major metros to figure out how you shift from the major urban hub out to the suburban sprawl, if that's what you're going for."

I noticed that the primary issue was that everyone wants to turn left, which conflicts with 6 lanes of traffic which leads to your extensive delays. I'd recommend either having a ramp come down on the other side of the street (so everyone is making rights instead), or replace the mess of an intersection with a roundabout. Just some suggestions. Best of luck!"

If you go on Google Earth and measure the dimensions of a real highway interchange, you'll see that some interchanges can be up to half a mile wide. I'd also recommend keeping the terminating highway 4 lanes wide. And just use curve pieces to get rid of the 45-degree cuts.

simcity4,2ybfwv,rubbishmyjunk,5,Sun Mar 8 06:47:23 2015 UTC,"There is no obscure cosmetic mod, and the textures aren't the main issue.  It's a matter of RUL overrides.  We'd need to go in and not only add the necessary textures, but then add RUL2 code to allow all the NWM networks to connect with all the SAM networks . . . which, at present, would mean 130 intersections.  With all the stability coding that would be needed to handle adjacencies, we'd be looking at tens of thousands of lines of code.  My post in the NWM thread was 4 years ago, when NWM 2.0 was still in development.  Development at that point was focused on the long sought-after triple-tile networks, and very little new NWM development has happened since then.  The SAM hasn't even been on the radar, and RHW-SAM crosslinking, which was looked at for the big RHW revamp with NAM 31.0, was scrapped, due to the controller size mess that followed in its wake (that has also effectively paralyzed NWM development).  GLR-in-AVE is a big pain to fix, because at present, it's puzzle piece-based.  Again, just making textures won't solve that, either.  I had experimented with an alternate implementation, which would make handling SAM and other override crosslinking easier, but it's a low priority.  The SAM isn't really on anyone's radar anymore developmentally.  The crosslinks between all these components are a killer.  There's so freaking many of them."

Just gonna do straight up texture replacement for now.  Or I was, but I have an issue. FiSHMan stopped working for some damn reason, just would plain fail as soon as I tried to open it, so I reinstalled it... and accidentally overwrote the new fshlib.dll, and in fact saved the old FiSHMan.xml... grrr I'm dumb. Of course, I hadn't dropped it in the SC4Tool folder yet, either, so I can't copy that one, much less make and test the actual textures. And the LEX, wonderful though it is, is being a prick about it. I can download ANY other file right now other than the DLL. It 404s me (connection reset) immediately, so I spam it and it finally loads the page that tells me I've exceeded my daily download limit for the file. It's like the file just doesn't exist on the server anymore. There is literally NO other copy of this file on the internet, at least that's what all my searching tells me. So I'm kinda SOL, stuck here with two useless PNGs unless someone happens to have a copy they can upload/email.  EDIT: I'm a dope. The new DLL has come with SC4Tool for six freaking years.

You can look at the population graph and compare the hi wealth res. numbers to the hi wealth Cs and hi tech industry populations and see how many people are unemployed. If all the rich people are employed then the rich Co's wont have any reason to move in to the city. Lots of unemployed rich people will shoot demand for Co's through the roof.  Edit: Just reread the main post, if the demand for rich Co's is already really high then i have no idea as to why they aren't moving in. Might be a bug?

Keep in mind the fact that real downtowns don't just spring up overnight, and decide whether you want the younger, more ""modern"" planned grid style (generally American) or if you want a more old-world style downtown with streets carved from centuries-old paths. If you aren't going to organically build up a downtown from the ""old city"" you need to think like you are when you design it.

This is why people have pushed for years for EA to make the source code public, but they won't because fuck you they're EA.  I have no doubt that there has been plenty of reverse engineering done of the EXE by certain knowledgeable people in the mod community for research, but obviously that's not talked about publicly lest SC4D be shut down for infringing copyright. This is actually why the CAM 2.0 beta was private to begin with: a crucial part of the process was patching the EXE. I don't really remember why, but that probably was a factor in the whole project never being fully realized, aside from the INSANE tuning research being done on the 4 (IIRC) versions. Between that, RL for the people doing the legwork (pretty much just RippleJet and I believe jmeyers), and eventual lack of interest on behalf of the community due to the double demand bug being fixed, it's no wonder it never saw the light of day. Shame, though. It was an amazing and ambitious project. I don't even know if Tage gives a shit about SC4 anymore, but if he sees this, hey bud.  In fact... I should go check that subforum.  EDIT: I was wrong about CAM 2 and patching the EXE... the iffy issue was patching SimCity_1.dat in the first place, which is the solution to the fucked up demand the CAM originally produced. Point still stands though, if not stronger, if editing a .dat file was enough to warrant fear of EA action. Also the versions of CAM 2 were Rural, Standard, and Skyscraper.

Either way, it doesn't have any textures or anything; it just extends whatever beach texture you do use farther inland. Rivit's Coastal Modd has quite a few different textures for both sand, close-to-shore water, and water further offshore (this mod is also probably based off elevation, so your shallows should all remain the color you select for ""inshore"")   I'm not sure of any tree controllers out there that have a more tropical or desert style, though I would certainly presume some of them do.

For example, the city I'm working on now:  I started at the beach, and put a nice ring of low-density houses in a suburb. I put a main road through the middle-ish and that dragged out to where I wanted my low-density commercial. I use NAM, so then I made a highway stretching to a far corner of the city where my industry is. (It has options for transitioning to a road so I plopped that in at the end of my main road.)  In the middle, I started my medium-density neighborhoods with medium-density commercial. I ran an avenue through that and stretched another highway perpendicular to the other one.   Now I'm getting ready to plan my high-density and skyscrapers. I'm going to run 2 avenues through it (maybe 3) with a big roundabout in the middle. That will be my city center and it'll be a big plaza thing. My biggest skyscrapers will be right in the middle, with the easiest access to avenues, and roads. Further from the middle will be shorter skyscrapers and HD-residential. Then medium-density and etc.   I think planning out roads first is a good idea. Do it like veins. One or two big main avenues in the middle, then roads, then streets. Make use of one-way roads."

Maybe that would help? You don't have that much plugins so it shouldn't take that long. Also, some plugins (like NAM I believe) have their own installers, so try downloading the newest version of NAM (for example) and then running the installer again as opposed to just transferring all the contents from your old plugins folder to your new one."

The further out you go while following this method, the higher residential to commercial ratio you want to get, and you want the commercial to be along the major roads. Eventually, this can fade into all residential. So basically what you're doing is gradually removing residential from the side streets, and keeping commercial on the major roads, until finally even the major roads are lined with residential."

Getting residential skyscrapers is very easy, but a large commercial core is difficult to achieve. My suggestion is to only zone dense commercial in your downtown tile, with medium commercial in all adjacent tiles. Have a very large high-density residential population in that district and all surrounding ones. Don't expect to see a large commercial district without having all adjacent tiles filled, and you'll almost never see them if your city consists of only one tile.  Here's a picture to explain the formula I use. I only use medium tiles so cut as desired http://imgur.com/GyPUwVG"

For that last number, the total comes from the sum of CO$$ and CO$$$ population across all the cities in the region."
simcity4,2xahz4,Fonzirelli,2,Fri Feb 27 12:48:43 2015 UTC,"Do you have NAM installed?  The latest updates of NAM come with CAM, which also makes your cities more realistic.  Spreading out before spiraling up.  There's two ways to get skyscrapers:   Build out.  Bring your population levels up.  There's different strategies for achieving this, most effective is to build up density in a central area, or an area you're choosing to designate as a ""downtown core.""  Just be prepared to handle all the amenities associated with such an area.   The easiest option, find user created lots and bats from online you can simply ""plop"" in your city.   I usually utilize the second method after I've begun to spread and build up residential areas.  Once my demands go up, I search for ways to satisfy.  Most plops have job numbers associated with them, so this allows you to have more creative control over your cores rather than relying on the chance of growth."

A person that experiences a falling environment rating has high pollution. Education and other desirability factors lead your industry to convert from dirty to manufacturing and then to high tech. These transitions will clean your air and water and employ a higher wealth population. Parks are a huge reason for high wealth commercial and residential development especially in high density zoning areas.
simcity4,2x6r1a,jrhallman,-8,Thu Feb 26 05:56:56 2015 UTC,The environment bar is effectively broken in SC4. It always starts fully green but at a certain point it will plummet to red and you'll never get it back up. It's glitched and it's best to just ignore it.
simcity4,2x6r1a,Fonzirelli,5,Thu Feb 26 02:29:05 2015 UTC,This response is completely inaccurate. If you are truly experiencing this then it might be a problem with your individual game. Try uninstalling/reinstalling.

It's something that I did struggle with for a long time but after building many different cities and trying many different styles of city building I found out the formula to keep my cities green. Usually a developing city and/or region is going to have a dirty industry period that will cause you to be in the red on the environment indicator. By slowly raising desirability factors and bulldozing dirty industry at the right times you will turn around your pollution problems. I've never played with pollution or desirability mods and I still have large cities will healthy environment ratings. It takes clean power sources, high tech industry, and the right ordinances to put in place. It might be one of the harder aspects to figure out in the game but look at how difficult an achievement it is in real life."

I used to make windy avenues, before I realized they look pretty bad.  Try this: organize your city before building, or at least organize as much as you can of it. Start building the roads that have the fastest traffic, and make then windier as you fill in the gaps.  This hierarchy works for me: highway>elevated highway>avenue>road>street  Additionally, try to leave lots of space between railroads and zones, make a 1 tile border buffer thing! Minimize the amount of railroad crossings, and imagine as if these cities you are making are actually real.  Also, do not zone huge chunks at all! Lay down the roads, and fill them up manually. It is important to use the ctrl, shift, and alt keys for the best control.   Try getting started on that, I have some follow up advice if that works"
simcity4,2wded2,x30ffx,5,Thu Feb 19 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"My secret to making things look consistently interesting (honestly it might sound a little crazy) is to leave little to no tiles uncovered by at least something. Find some ploppable tree and grass lots that are 1x1, and place them EVERYWHERE you don't have buildings, roads, etc. If you have a lot of slopes in your city, build retaining walls (having different elevations is a great way to make a city more interesting.

simcity4,2wamw0,CoastRunner27,6,Wed Feb 18 15:35:03 2015 UTC,I use water pipes to mark where I want things to line up. Especially streets since they don't make neighbor connections.
simcity4,2wamw0,cdavidg4,6,Wed Feb 18 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, matching densities (and wealth levels, and zones) is about the most I do. It's easier in very dense urban areas, because those are more monotonous, and in very rural areas, since you can keep a consistent farm width that isn't interrupted by the border line. Sometimes I alter coastlines so that they look like they're cut off in the middle of a map, because that kind of makes it harder to see the underlying grid."

simcity4,2wbdq2,LuukwaHD,9,Wed Feb 18 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/YouWantALime has already said, here are some basic budgeting rules for a new city:   Build a coal power plant, it's cheap and efficient. Only zone low density, anything else is too expensive and won't get built anyways. Don't start with roads, avenues, highways, etc. stick to streets until traffic starts to back up. Don't build any services or utilities beyond power. Slums are fine to start out. Don't build landmarks, they're super expensive and don't help you in the beginning.   Once you have a positive cash flow, you can start adding stuff:   When you build services (schools, clinics, etc.) trim down their area and funding to only service what you need (you can learn about this in the ""Making Money"" tutorial). Don't convert everything to avenues. One way roads are cheaper and don't require bulldozing. You shouldn't need highways unless you have neighbor connections and lots of low density. Focus on smaller areas to build up and service them with public transport (subway, buses, etc.). If you're low on funds you can take u-drive-it missions that give you cash. They give you simoleons but reduce your mayor rating (who cares?). Try to maintain a 1-3 thousand surplus at all times. If you're getting closer to 1k try to find out where your money is going and mitigate it."
simcity4,2wbdq2,starshard0,6,Wed Feb 18 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am doing it wrong or something, but I have had several cities that I slam medium to high density zoning early or right away and still pull it off.  In general, other than the tutorial map that starts you off with $100k I find most areas to be too easy due to starting money - so I will burn off a few hundred k to to add to the challenge..."
simcity4,2wbdq2,devedander,3,Wed Feb 18 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you have more experience than OP. It's definitely possible to slam medium and high density from the start and still come out fine. It's very expensive early on though, and if you're struggling with money it just exacerbates the problem."
simcity4,2wbdq2,starshard0,2,Wed Feb 18 18:24:15 2015 UTC,Curious what is more expensive about medium and high density?  I always just figured it made things cheaper as the range of your utilities now covered more residents for the same price...
simcity4,2wbdq2,devedander,2,Wed Feb 18 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"Initial cost. Low density is $10 per square, medium and high are $20 and $50, respectively. If you're struggling with money, it's better to stick to low density until you have positive cash flow, then upgrade as you go."
simcity4,2wbdq2,starshard0,3,Wed Feb 18 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I never even thought about that... I got used to the tutorial square that starts you off with $100k so having $500k right off on the other ones makes me not even think about that kind of cost...   Good call though!"
simcity4,2wbdq2,devedander,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"I've done many a city where I never zone any medium or low density whatsoever, and it can actually make a lot of money in the short run--build a dense square of Residential and Commercial in one corner, give it water and electricity, and then let it build in squalor for a couple years. You can end up taking in $10k and only spending $1k, and it's pretty stable. Once you start providing services, though, you lose the margin pretty fast."
simcity4,2wbdq2,saltyseahag69,3,Wed Feb 18 23:06:25 2015 UTC,This will help so much! Thanks for taking the time to write all this!
simcity4,2wbdq2,devedander,3,Wed Feb 18 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb - do not build services until people start complaining it's missing.   So obviously you need to zone residential and some sort of job (usually industrial will be your go to early one) and some sort of power (I start with windmills and upgrade to a power plant once 5 windmills won't cover it).   Next utility will be water at some point.   Remember only bring water to places with the little blue drop over them, no need to pipe under zones that don't care about water.   Then comes education - because my goal is always to get rid of dirty industry and become entirely clean high tech and commercial.   I will place a small fire house in my industrial area so I don't have to keep dealing with the almost constant fires that will pop up there.  At this point it becomes a game of responding to what people ask for and balancing budgets but by now it should be relatively simple.  Remember to adjust budgets to each utility so that it's not over funded (ie don't have a school with 50 teachers and 50 students).  Remember to sprinkle parks and bus stops to keep land value up.  As for making the game easier, install NAM.  The massive boost to traffic efficiency lets your zones build up to high numbers fast which means tax dollars fast."
simcity4,2wbdq2,YouWantALime,2,Wed Feb 18 17:14:30 2015 UTC,"What exactly did you build? In the first few days you shouldn't really need any city services, libraries, etc."
simcity4,2wbdq2,YouWantALime,2,Wed Feb 18 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"Did zoning, then i build a hospital and firestation.. and a power station ofcourse.."
simcity4,2wbdq2,devedander,2,Wed Feb 18 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is zone for a small farm and then place a wind turbine, just to get started. I think you could also start with a power plant. Whatever you choose to use, make sure you take its funding way down, so that it is only producing what you need. After that, I zone for some housing, which leads to more demand for farms. While a hospital and fire station are good things to build, you probably can't afford it in the beginning and likely don't need it yet. If you do end up having a fire, you can always build a fire station then demolish it after the fire is out. Another thing you can do is allow gambling in your city, which gives you an extra 100 simoleons per month. The bottom line is, this is a slow game, and you shouldn't be expecting skyscrapers for a while. Anyway, that's what I do. Hope it helps!"

simcity4,2vhwp0,novak253,4,Wed Feb 11 03:29:49 2015 UTC,"I've been really interested in the capabilities of NAM and using it the way I've seen in some stranger infrastructure patterns.  I used GLR in the middle of RHW both sunken, then used a 0/15 meter transit station from NAM (The name escapes me sorry). Generally this was designed for a raised rail and ground rail to cross over in a station but I used elevated road to act as a bus stop and connector to the GLR below. I was basing it off the blue line in Chicago  Its fully functional, and the only drawbacks is that because of the nature of this being an overhang station I had to use 5 spaces across to fit it. You could use 4 but I wanted the symmetry."

They are general use stations and can be for really any transit (bus tram, train monorail).   They're meant to be something like an El rail over train, or Monorail over Tram etc. but I used it unconventionally to use the raised road over ground tram. The raised road activates the bus while GLR activates tram."

simcity4,2vgca7,calvss,2,Tue Feb 10 21:03:13 2015 UTC,You're getting awfully close to the RAM limit for 32-bit applications. Add some overhead and the simcity_x.dat files and you might be hitting the absolute limit.
simcity4,2vgca7,Tarkus-OR,4,Wed Feb 11 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"There isn't really an absolute limit, at least, not one easily reachable one.  Certainly, once you pass a certain threshold, things will bog down a ton, but at least in the Windows environment, virtual memory starts to fill in the gap.  I don't know how OS X treats virtual memory, but I'd imagine there's something similar in place.  The Mac limit is not a hard file size limit, either--it's a number of files limit, and it can be reached by simply stuffing a couple hundred blank folders in the plugins folder.  I think a more likely scenario is that you may have some conflicting plugins mixed in there--particularly after dumping 1000 more in there before DatPacking--and those might be causing your beachballing."
simcity4,2vgca7,calvss,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm going to go through all of the files and see if there is anything like that.I did make sure to dump the 1000 extra files into the original folder and make sure not to have any doubles before I did it, so I'm wondering if it's dependancies that are buggering everything up (though afaik having doubled dependancies rarely does this and only takes up additional space and increases loadtime).  I switched from the Appalachian Terrain Mod to the Columbus Terrain mod and I see a definite improvement in loadtimes as well as little things like scrolling and planting trees in god-mode.   Do you know if the Steam version has the same issues as the Aspyr App Store version? I'm not sure how virtual memory works since the app-store version is sandboxing, so I'm hoping Aspyr had the sense to put x64 support in when they ported it over or else that would definitely explain the issue.  Also, do you think it would help to datpack smaller groups of .SC4Lots/.SC4Models up then datpack all of that in order to further compress the size, or would the size difference be negligible and just a waste of a few hours?"

Raise the land-bridge high enough that a tunnel can be created with a portal on each end. Build tunnel, ensuring that the portals are where you want them to be. Lower the land back down. For near the tunnels, using road tiles is recommended over the terraforming tools.   Important note: This method is problematic with UDI and will most likely involve you crashing into the water. Also, you most likely will get cars/trains floating out over the water. It still works as a fully-functional connection, however."

simcity4,2v4xdm,MayorPayne,3,Sun Feb 8 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"I don't completely isolate neighborhoods like some other mayors have suggested, but I do frequently design my cities with the objective of encouraging public transportation over roads. the strategy im about to describe is focused on creating a city that looks and feels reasonably realistic, but still follows a design philosophy that discourages driving. (i play vanilla, most because i'm currently playing in a co-op region and we've agreed to play vanilla to reduce the risk bugs and that sort of thing)  first is the order in which i build infastructure prior to zoning and populating the city. i usually build the skeleton of my rail network before anything else. this connects to the region and since ive built rail before roads its more likely that my rail will provide the fastest most direct route between the major points in my city and between cities in the region. don't over design rail at the beginning, just enough that the major sections of the map have a rail line going through them. also, if possible design the rail so that multiple rail lines converge in  the area of the city you would like to be the CBD. this way as you build ""suburbs"" or further out neighborhoods the public transportation infastructure will encourage growth in this one particular area of the city.   next comes road design. this is probably the most important part of the infastructure design that will encourage public transportation use in the city. i recommend building your city along a more medieval or european ""spoke and wheel"" type plan as opposed to the more rational/american grid plan. you want Rome or Paris, not New York or Philadelphia. The idea is to create prohibative traffic patterns that increase the distance between the major residential and commercial neighborhoods of the city, becuase if public transportation is the more direct, faster route, your sims will prefer to use it.   another important aspect of roads is which road you use in which area. use roads sparingly. avoid boulevards to start with. add them much later as needed in areas that are either far away, or are like suburbs, or are have cronic traffic problems. instead your downtown core should have a skeleton of arterial roads connected by one ways and streets. use one ways strategically to control the flow of traffic. use streets in areas where you dont want or dont expect lots of through traffic. webs of one way streets that dont go directly between the commercial and residential neighborhoods and instead connect them obliquely will encourage public transportation use. i also advocate protectionist borders. placing toll boths on roads that lead out of the city will at least capture some of the money that leaves with the commuters and probably encourage just a little bit of public transportation use.   next comes zoning. begin your city in a small area. ideally the area of the city you wish to become the central business district. begin zoning your city using a mixed zoning plan. dont over zone commercial in the CBD to start. i feel this is a mistake many mayors make. if you start with a mixed zoning you will ideally create a commuting pattern which encourages pedestrian traffic.   once pedestrian traffic has developed, foster it. use the traffic tool to see pedestrian traffic and put bus stops there to start with. if the sims are already walking heavily in one area its likely they will take the bus a well.   the last area of advice i have is to avoid cannibalism between systems. the bus system generally encourages regional rail and subway systems, but it has been my experience that overlapping subway and rail systems tend to cannibalize each other. i try to design my infastructure in such a way that the subway and rail don't overlap and generally go to different parts of the city or at least are designed in such a way that traffic is carried in different directions (east west vs north south)   id be happy to hear from folks with a different or conflicting experience or post some screen shots of recent projects to clarify some of these ideas."

simcity4,2uue1e,TheLugNutZ,7,Thu Feb 5 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"I believe this is caused by focusing on another program window while a city is saving, such as Alt-Tabbing to your browser instead of staring at the screen while the game just sits there saving.  The same bug can happen if you have a second monitor and switch to it while the game saves your city.  Large cities with high population or jobs and/or a lot of props (e.g., tons of suburbs, a street tree mod, ploppable water, lots of fancy custom parks, a complex tree controller) will take much longer to save, especially on an older computer.  A faster CPU and an SSD are the only remedies.  If I remember correctly, your cities are still there, and you can get the region view back by entering them, saving, and just waiting for it to complete the save without switching to another window.  If the game is currently running, the safest practice would be to minimize the game first and make a backup of those cities (maybe the whole region) in case this doesn't work.  Test this with just one city first.  If you try that and the region view doesn't go back to normal, exit the game, restart, and try again.  I've only experienced this once, and the above solution worked for me.  It happened all the time in HalJackey's YouTube series ""Building a City From Scratch"" and he never had a problem re-entering the city.  If this fails and the cities are gone forever, I'll show you the easiest way to get your terrain back.  But you may not hear from me right away.

simcity4,2up3q4,manuscarlisle,27,Wed Feb 4 00:05:23 2015 UTC,"Tl;Dr: As a beginner, build cities however you want and use this time just to learn how the game works.  Eventually, you'll learn that planning ahead is key, and new cities/regions will start with transit networks.  Sorry this is so lengthy.  It's probably more than you want, but I really enjoy this game -- playing it as well as talking about it.  Let me know if you have other questions or need some links to the stuff mentioned here.  When I first started playing SC4, I would just draw zones wherever I felt like it, add electricity, and start the simulator.  The cities would grow all willy-nilly and, as such, so did the region; thus, the region view looked ridiculous.  Occasionally I'll load up one of those old regions and shake my head & face-palm, wondering what I was thinking at the time.  I understand now, though, that those early cities served a couple purposes.  Firstly, they allowed me the time that a beginner needs to just learn how to make a city profitable, which is the only definite goal of the game -- if you go broke, you lose.  So it was a period of getting to know how to work with the various aspects of the simulator (traffic, workforce & demand, budget, civics, etc.), rather than against them.  Secondly, they presented opportunities to appreciate realism, or in those early stages, the lack thereof.  Third, those haphazard cities and their odd, incongruent, or downright ugly region views served as testbeds for learning how to re-purpose or re-invent a city or part/all of a region.  This can be quite challenging because of the way data generated by the demand and traffic simulators gets saved in one city and is then used by the surrounding cities to influence their own demand and traffic data.  (This would be a good time to search sc4devotion.com for the dreaded ""eternal commuter loop."")  If you choose to re-design a region, take it slow -- make minor changes in one city, then save and exit, enter all the neighboring cities and make adjustments as necessary.  Wash, rinse, repeat for the whole region, repeatedly.  To see what I mean, copy a backup of one region, then make sweeping changes in one city, such as de-zoning all the residential areas to eliminate the entire population, run the game for a couple Sim-months, save & exit, then see the catastrophic effects in the neighbor cities.  Then you'll see the importance of making slow changes in this circumstance.  At that point, delete the region and move the backup into its place to restore it to the way it was.  Data for each city is stored in the city name.sc4 file, nowhere else.  I realize none of that answers your question, so I'll get to my point.  Build your cities however you want for now, so that you can focus on just learning how make a city and region work.  Start on a blank, flat region, because working with irregular terrain can be a pain in the neck and cause a lot of frustration when you're just trying to keep from being impeached for failing to maintain a budget.  (Pro Tip: Sims don't need healthcare as much as the lady with the awful haircut wants you to think they do!  Wait until you're wealthy enough to afford it.)  Get a slope mod (the one by Ennedi) and start a practice region with moderately irregular terrain.  Learn to accommodate the terrain without making too many drastic terraformig changes.  Practice first with the various networks, especially RHW, and don't worry about making a whole city.  In time, the desire to create more realistic-looking cities -- and especially regions, which is not so easy -- will force you into the realization that pre-planning is essential.  Find a really nice, eye-catching region: one that's not too big, or it will take forever to load (SC4 can only be sped up by an SSD and a very powerful CPU), and you may never finish it before you get bored.  By the time you're at this stage of experience, you'll know the importance of having a robust transportation system, incorporating multiple travel methods for your Sims.  Placing the major network arteries will most likely be how you'll begin developing new regions.  It's OK to have a handful of regions going at once, each with a different style or theme.  Before laying zones in your beautiful new region, just stare at it; maybe take a picture of the region view using Sawtooth's Region Census or SFBT's Startup Manager.  Think about where the Central Business District would be.  What about industry?  How far apart do you want the large metropolitan areas?  What do you want between them?  Farms?  Suburbs?  Mountains?  Water?  Forest preserve?  How will they be connected?  Heavy rail, monorail, highway?  Draw a rough map on paper or load up the region view image in a graphic editor and make some basic plans.  In this planning stage, put zones roughly where you think they should go, then connect them with multiple transit types.  When you actually begin the region in-game, lay the networks and electricity first, then do zoning.  Maybe make a couple different versions.  There's nothing stopping you from making a copy of the region folder and giving it a slightly different name (don't just rename the folder; open the region.ini file and apply the change in the ""Name = "" field, too) describing what sets it apart from the other, then build out the two identical regions, each in a different way and just see how it goes.  This will teach you how fulfilling it can be to flesh out a concept for a region and then watch it grow into your vision as you progress through each city tile.  No matter what your experience level, you'll always be experimenting.  Make frequent backups of your regions so you can undo any catastrophic mistakes or restore from crashed or corrupted cities.  Above all, treat it like advanced interactive digital Legos -- build what you want and have fun doing it!"

simcity4,2up3q4,antsel,8,Tue Feb 17 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"I think about the history of the world: where a port might develop, where farms might be based, where a specific neighborhood would be etc.  Then I build roads (not grid plopping) based on the age of the area. Older parts of a city will have disjointed, almost chaotic road layouts while newer developments will be better planned. For a good real world example of this look at the grid difference between lower and midtown manhattan."
simcity4,2up3q4,piaculus,4,Wed Feb 4 06:11:56 2015 UTC,"I like to start by growing farms first. I'm from Western Canada, so I usually start by running grid roads north/south and east/west, and zone agriculture within those areas in variable sizes. Then once all the farms are grown, I'll drag a rail line through my town (dependent on terrain of course). Finally I'll start growing a town starting at a crossroads near the railway. Sometimes the town ends up only have around 10 houses. Sometimes it turns into a metropolis."
simcity4,2up3q4,Wouter10123,3,Wed Feb 4 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"Super pre-planned cities are ugly and boring, but you want to plan something.  I like to start a small town, near the coast, but not next to it.  I build two parallel two way roads, with 4 tiles between them (total six tile width).  This area will eventually be my main thoroughfare in the city, where I will raze anything between the two roads and create an avenue with bus, light rail, etc.  Everything else I do one piece at a time.  I'm willing to raze some things to upgrade infrastructure as necessary, but I try not to go overboard.  I like to consider that there are people living in these places that don't want to see everything they've known destroyed for a giant freeway or what have you.    I'm the developer, city planner, conservationist, local government, and citizens all in one.  Before I do things, I like to have all the conversations and town hall meetings in my head.  Maybe there's a corrupt city official taking kickbacks from a inner city developer bent on pushing out less wealthy residents.  Maybe there's a protectionist movement to prevent a mining operation on the outskirts.  Cities are a living thing full of people with different goals and motivations.  I like to treat them that way.  And don't forget farms."
simcity4,2up3q4,mikmeh,3,Sun Feb 8 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"First, find a place where a city is likely to be founded (ie at the merge point of two rivers or a big bend in a river for trade and defensibility purposes) and just start building.   Couple of houses, few shops, etc, stay on the same side of the river! Manufacturing industry a little bit away from the first cores (possibly across the river, if you can justify it).   When necessary, build a small ring. As you build outward, zones /cores can become bigger. Build some train tracks /stations while keeping in mind the rest of the region. Remember, trains are primarily intercity transportation, not intracity. Again start small and if necessary, build more.   Keep expanding the city, replace I-M with high tech, and start on a freeway. Same with trains, keep in mind the whole region when building these. A large city gets a full ring (unless it borders a sea, obviously), a smaller city just gets one or two freeways going past it."
simcity4,2up3q4,EmeraldScales,3,Wed Feb 4 12:58:44 2015 UTC,"I'll add to the play however you want and also say, SC4 is a sandbox. I long ago figured out vanilla and built sprawling regions with cities that weren't broke. Once I found mods I started using money cheat buildings so I had an infinite budget and then played it as a sandbox instead. The only part of the game I really play is demand and trying to tailor things to demand what I want in a particular city.   To start off I find a good region map. Lately Alaskan stuff. Then I pick whichever place on the map I like most and begin. Usually a small city I plan on filling the plot with and then zone farms around it. My very first city will be organic. When it comes time to start my actual downtown (for the region) I plan everything out."

simcity4,2up3q4,tagehring,1 point,Wed Feb 4 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"I start off with a main road and some houses on it, with farms expanding radially from the town.  I keep expanding, houses sometimes going to the middle and sometimes farther out, and farms going farther out in branches.  Main intersections begin to have commercial, and neighborhoods begin to come together.  By the time around 3000 people live in a medium tile, I'm at the border.  Businesses also begin to form along that original main road, and the town expands.  Industry moves in at the fringes of the existing small town.  Expansion may continue, or it may stop, and other areas may take precedence.  Many starting places at once make for a very organic looking landscape."
simcity4,2up3q4,MayorPayne,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:18:42 2015 UTC,"Some of both. When I'm first starting a region, I'll just draw a small grid in a likely spot on a riverfront, and let it develop from there. Build a 2-lane road connection to a neighboring tile, then a railroad, then eventually an avenue or a highway as needed. Put industry downwind or downriver from the residential areas, etc."
simcity4,2up3q4,jaayyne,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"These days I always design the transportation network and zones before even starting the first city, the current project took almost a week of tinkering with pencil and square paper to complete. Grids are the alpha and omega, aesthetic beauty and ""realism"" are of very little concern to me. I use no mods, it's a fun challenge to manage congestion and make sims use mass transit without NAM.  However, if you're new I heartily recommend doing the tutorials and simply toying around, every city that goes broke or stagnates or develops massive pollution/traffic problems teaches you something valuable, and soon you'll know exactly what you want and how to get it :)"
simcity4,2up3q4,DuffyO,1 point,Sat Feb 7 11:08:50 2015 UTC,"I like to start with a skeleton basically, making the roads and letting them sprawl out. Then I add rail and subways, then I start zoning.   If something doesn't make sense I usually stick a park in it. I also like making big central plazas for everyone to congregate. Near this is my city hall, a church, etc."
simcity4,2up3q4,DuffyO,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"I've started to try something new recently. I grab a sheet of graph paper and map the city limits on it, and plan out what I want my city to look like. Gets a bit tedious with coastline/rivers, but gives me a general sense of where I want certain things to be. Personally, the most enjoyable part of Simcity 4 is the transportation network. Setting up an efficient network is quite satisfying."
simcity4,2up3q4,harrychin2,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"out of interest, do you normally prefer to set up the transportation network at the very start or do you build it up over time?"
simcity4,2uqnlm,MayorPayne,2,Wed Feb 4 09:29:06 2015 UTC,"If you're using the NAM (which I assume you are), you can enable the ""Clean air act"" ordinance to greatly reduce traffic pollution (60% reduction, if I'm not mistaken). You can also use the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool to control how much traffic pollution is removed.  I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for, but if you're having problems with traffic pollution enabling this ordinance will help a lot :)"
simcity4,2uqnlm,vicvipe,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not using the NAM, but I did find the place in the game files that converts traffic into air pollution and it would be a fairly easy tweak through that. Once it really gets out of hand, I might consider..."
simcity4,2uqnlm,jaayyne,1 point,Thu Feb 5 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"Alas, it seems impossible since the game regards all moving sims as simply ""traffic"", with no distinction between their mode of transport :sadface:"
simcity4,2uqnlm,ActuallyYeah,3,Wed Feb 4 13:57:15 2015 UTC,So even pedestrians generate pollution?   Are all sims in SC4 really gassy or something?
simcity4,2uqnlm,nolvorite,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"Well, walking and taking the bus don't generate traffic, but there most certainly is an option to include them with the rest so yes, a sim could potentially pollute like a car just by walking..."

simcity4,2umx5b,Tusen_Takk,4,Tue Feb 3 14:06:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, I had a look at this problem and found a solution, but it isn't elegant. This basically arises because there are currently no height transition puzzle pieces for tram in avenue. Here is a pic of what I made: http://i.imgur.com/PiJrnOY.png. This takes up a lot of space, unfortunately. The basic idea is to convert the TiA into GLR and 2 OWRs, then use these networks to get over the GHW. This will require that your GHW is brought up, as the El-Rail will not dip down to the base level.  I used two OWR over GHW on the side, and used a GLR to El-Rail one space away from the GHW. The El-Rail can simply be dragged across the GHW. Then a few tiles away I placed the TiA to OWR and GLR puzzle piece down (third item in the TiA tab ring) and connected the pieces.  Out of interest, have you considered using RHW-4 as your ground highway? There's a few more puzzle pieces in there, so there might be a more elegant solution in there.  Hope this helps!"

I don't use the BTM, so I don't know if there's a puzzle piece for it going over light rail.  There is one for regular elevated heavy rail, though.  If you don't find it in the subway menu, check in the rail menu."

simcity4,2uejdt,HS_from_Simtropolis,2,Tue Feb 3 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"I'm currently figuring out how to generate maps using real world data. I've got as far as creating a map that is workable in SC4 if not exactly pretty. It has elevations that are about right, the bits I want above sea level are above see level but there are several lakes, rivers and various other water features that don't appear once the map has gone through the process. So the results still aren't satisfactory.   There are several reasons for this such as Simcity 4's limit on water level (the rivers/lakes are above sea level in the DEM data which results in them being dry land in SC4) and the limited grayscale images that MicroDEM produces result in a stepped, unnatural looking map. These issues could be fixed using SC4Terraformer but it'd take a lot of work... which, aside from probably being unnecessarily time consuming, would most likely result in a map that looks unnatural.  I'm gonna play around a bit more with the various steps to see if I can produce a better result. When I do, I intend to write and keep an up to date tutorial and post it over at the Simtropolis forums."

simcity4,2u80wi,mikmeh,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:00:25 2015 UTC,Roads that curve for no reason :)
simcity4,2u80wi,TheManFromRoomFive,2,Sun Feb 1 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"Edit: Sorry for the wall of text in response to your single sentence comment.  I tend to be long-winded!  There's actually several good reasons for suburban street designs to curve in a seemingly aimless pattern.  When all of a city's streets and roads are set up in a grid pattern and the main throughway becomes congested, it's too easy for frustrated, impatient commuters to develop their own alternate parallel routes to avoid the congested roads by driving through suburban neighborhoods.  The purpose of the suburbs, though, is to have peace and quiet, as well as low-traffic streets that are safer for young children.  The winding curves and cul-de-sacs of modern suburban layouts prevent this, so suburban neighborhoods remain quiet and safe, as they are intended, and also reduce the city's costs for maintenance due to lower amounts of traffic.  These factors make the suburban areas more desirable to residents, and thus improve the local real estate market.  Also, forcing drivers to move along the corridors that the city planner intends to be used by higher volumes of traffic makes those areas more commercially desirable -- and thus, profitable -- for local businesses due to the increased exposure.  These directed traffic patterns allow the municipal street department to maintain a regular schedule of maintenance for the roads which they can reliably predict will need resurfacing due to the heavy use they see.  That's why modern suburbs (starting around the 1960s or '70s, I think) have such curvy layouts -- they are actually meant to be confounding to traffic flow.  Old grid-patterned suburban neighborhoods that want to reduce through traffic can demolish a few houses and adopt a fused grid quadrant to control the route traversed by the rush hour commuters.  SimCity4 players using the Network Addon Mod (I consider the game broken and unplayable without it!) can implement the fused grid when updating their old grid-style suburban street networks.  This, along with the corrected traffic simulator in NAM, will prevent the Sim commuters from choosing such ridiculous routes to and from work by forcing them onto networks with higher speeds and capacities."
