NexusNewbies,3e131e,joosh82,13,Tue Jul 21 03:33:50 2015 UTC,"The quick and easy lesson is to focus on the healer first.   Not necessarily. Lili is a good example here.  Between her trait, certain talents, and especially Kung-Fu hustle at level 20 she's actually quite difficult to focus without a fully attentive team.   However, her healing lacks burst (and her burst healing ultimate can be interrupted) which means you can generally eat through a squishy assassin in a focused attack even while she's healing them.  Thus making Lili a less-priority target than certain other squishies.    A lot of target prioritization is subject to positioning.  ""Only focus target X"" can be its own form of tunnel vision, even if based on reasonable logic about who is the most easily killed.  You've experienced this with Sgt Hammer.  While you're correct that she's a high priority target, she also has a strong set of escape abilities.  Diving through both her teammates and her siege range just to encounter that escape is a fools errand.  Though it sounds backwards, it might be more successful in such a situation to back out of her siege range entirely, draw their team's warrior out with you, and focus down the warrior (or a nearby assassin) while they've lost Hammer's cover fire.    The decision making process for target priority is all about risk and reward.  High reward targets are often high risk targets.  You want to kill the healer, but the healer is sandwiched between hammer and kael'thas and all three of them are standing behind the warrior.  You don't necessarily want to focus the warrior, but he's the only safe target to attack.  So what do you do?  Players tend to take ""never attack the warrior"" as an absolute law.  But it isn't.  Most of the time it isn't even the correct decision.  You have to attack something.  Might as well be the warrior.  The statement should be, ""only attack the warrior when better targets are not readily available.  But don't blow your whole set of cooldowns on him.  Just poke him a bit.  Either his team will jump on you, and then you can blow one of them up, or he's going to take enough damage to tuck tail and retreat, giving you an open opportunity to jump on his team's squishies.  And don't chase the warrior either, even if he is at half health, there are squishies to kill.""  Of course, that isn't easy to type in-game, so people say, ""never attack the warrior."""
NexusNewbies,3e131e,maldrame,5,Tue Jul 21 05:59:03 2015 UTC,There was a league video about this. You hit what you can hit safely in general. Especially if your a carry ranged carry outputting constant dps will win you the fight. If uther heals anub he can't heal their illidan.

This too, warriors in this game arent unkillable, and if you harass them hard enough they have to back out exposing their squishier teammates, or they have to stay commited and die.  The bigger problem I find is people over commit to pretty much anything... For instance...   You pushed through top fort and then the curse ended, that's great! Oh you kept going and now you all wiped and lost that 2 level advantage for nothing... enemy is now free to take boss and next tribute gg... Look our warrior just harassed their front line warrior... lets try to run past both of them to the vallah in the back... oh whats that Im dead? Gg. Look we are only three men down and they rez in 20 secs, lets go team fight 2v5 and see if we can wipe them! Followed by the three other players rezzing and two of them doing the same thing... I actually lost a match despite getting every tribute, every boss, and every merc camp in a game recently.

Nope, I think you should try all the free to play heroes and if there is one you like first check if he is available in any packages in the shop or elsewhere (I got the starter pack in the shop for 5 dollars the other day with three heroes which I felt was a good deal), and if not save up and buy them. Despite what people say, I personally feel its good to know any of the current meta heroes if you plan on jumping in HL, but if you have no plans for that anytime soon just go with what you feel is best / most fun for you. I personally just bought Johanna for 10k. I fought against her several times and it was really frustrating, I realized shes good at some things and fits my playstyle and is in the current meta, so despite never playing her I bought her and now shes my top hero. I did my research beforehand to ensure she was a decent pick and ""HL viable."" My next pick will probably happen in a similar manner. Pinging the map. Not dying to silly stuff (dont jump in team fights a man down, and defintely dont try to 1v5). Soaking exp every chance you get outside of objectives. Watching for camps to spawn. Knowing where your enemies are. Not overextending. Pushing the enemy core when you see a good opening. Poking, and harassing before jumping in a fight, a lot of players will eventually mess up and overextend and you can then blast them. Focus on soaking without dying, and being with your teammates during objectives. Having 5 men comitting to a stupid plan is often better than having 3 men commiting to a stupid plan and 2 men commiting to a good one."
NexusNewbies,3e0zeq,BigDaddyBus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"Edit: Specialist demand depends on the gaming type and free rotation. When Sylvanas is on a free week QM has a Sylv in every game. In HL there should be a Sylv in every game since she is extremely powerful when played well. Thus if you like specialists learn to deal hero dmg and participate in team fights safely with your specialists and you will always have a place in the team. Both Zagara and Sylvanas are highly valued heroes when played well. I love playing assassins in soloqueue QM. Specialists come as a good second, but like the comments here suggests you get a lot less grief if you play well as an assa/spec in comparison to sup or war. When in a party or HL I must say playing supports brings me the most kicks. Innervate (with talents) is so powerful right now that I'm easily the MIP as Malfurion. Uther and Rehgar with clutch saves also brings much joy to me and my team. I do like warriors as well, but even in HL or in a party the retreat signals I give get ignored.. and when I leave, heroes get taken out. Saying all this I must confess to being an allarounder as I have roughly the same amount of games played with each of the types."

NexusNewbies,3e05u0,Mr_Kid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:48 2015 UTC,I'm not a pro by any means so take my advice for what it's worth. In a team fight I position either on top or below the fight since they seem to almost always be going left or right. If the fight is in the bottom lane sit on top and top lane sit below so you always have plenty of area to run if you have to. That way if your team is winning and pushing them back the enemy team is moving away from you not on top of you and if the enemy team is winning and pushing your team back they are still moving away from you. if the two teams are colliding vertically I would position on the side that our core is on. If there is no team fight I will harass anyone on the other team i can find. Even if I can't kill them slowing them down or annoying them is better then trying to lane imo.

The most important is obviously getting coins and then not losing coins. So just knowing the timing of chests and pinging is  clueless teammates is crucial. Also, map vision and pinging danger. Always count how many you see on the mini map and make sure you outnumber whatever potential gank awaits you at the turn in. Otherwise don't go the little gear icon at the score screen. Once you leave the score screen you are out of luck randomness once it's out of ammo you see the icon but once it's almost done reloading you'll see the icon pulsate."

Usually I see people go 2-2-1 because the bottom lane is so far away from the others you probably don't want more than 2 there because they won't be able to respond to threats quickly (mainly contesting Boss and teamfights) It can be hard to coordinate with a team on that map but I've heard people say its better to follow your team doing something dumb than try to do something smart by yourself. You're right to want to contest turn ins. I'd encourage your team to take mercs when they can and play more defensively. Bombards are as effective as a push and there is less chance of your team being wiped if you fight at the turn in then if you get caught in their base. When the game is over go to the stats screen (before you hit leave) and you can add/report people from there. Probably just matchmaking strangeness and teamwork Towers and Forts have limited ammo. When they run out you'll see that symbol while it reloads. I don't know how long it takes.

I notice people lose shit tons of soak on this map too... they will try to turn in 1v5 only to die and lose all their coins, and just generally do stupid shit all day... and either I have phenomenally bad luck or there is something I'm just missing on this map...

The rest of my team is near the bottom.  I'm pretty sure there is going to be a team fight pretty shortly because they are skirmishing with the other team but no one has yet committed.  The temples aren't going active anytime real soon.  Both teams are level 11 or 12.    If I continue my push, I'm pretty confident I'm going to take down a fort, but that means my team will be 4v5 and I won't make it down in time.

NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,randomechoes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"So, i'm not a hammer expert or anything but imo both are valid strategies. If you know for a fact that all 5 enemy members are bot lane or dead and you want to take down the fort, say something like "" pushing top fort. Dont engage just delay"" in chat.  If your teammates are good they should be able to distract the enemy and stay alive long enough for you to take the fort down and give a lvl advantage. If your team sees enemies leaving to go top, hopefully they ping danger for you to get out safely. The problem is you have to be organized and have everyone on the same page.  If you're Solo Q'ing the safer option would be to join the team for a 5v5 or else they might rush in, die, and then flame you for not being there. ""This fuking hammer man. Join the team n00b"""

Your team should just defend bot and stay safe, it's very hard to push 5v4 at that level, you can just poke and at some point they will have to back. If you feel like your team will try to engage a big 4v5 fight maybe type ""don't engage 4v5"" in the chat.

Hammer's Ultimate by the sounds of it. /u/RogueT3ch mentioned that it goes ""around the world"" and I just want to help clarify. What it does is it follows the path that it was cast in - a direct line. After it completes its travel across the map, it ""cools down"" for roughly 5 seconds I believe. Then it follows the same path, over, and over endlessly. This can add up quickly. I have a friend who plays Hammer pretty often and almost always gets this talent. It has saved the game for us several times. Around levels 24ish, it actually does more damage than the shield regenerates, so you can actually slowly, SLOWLY, whittle the nexus down. But at the least, it would have no shield so any damage would basically be taking it down."

I keep finding myself in matches where 2 people go to one lane, 3 people go another, and to be the nice guy I go to the third empty lane. Usually have 3 enemies in my lane at that point. I even played a 2 lane map where all 4 went to bottom! I read everywhere to fill the lanes early game. Are these people more interested in being tough for team fights? Is there a good reason to do this?  also - is murky's egg invisible when I lay it in grass?"
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,Dakrulan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"For 3 lane maps it's standard to go a in a 2/2/1 format. Maybe not in that order, but in that formation. There are times when you might see a 1/1/3, for example before the second temple spawns on Sky Temple map since it spawns only at bot lane.  As for the 1/4 formation on a two lane map, that's also standard. It might seem more natural to have a 2/3 formation, or a 2/2 with one person roaming, but there are advantages to 1/4. For example, if the current map is Haunted Mines, then you could either push your golem lane with 4 people; or if the enemy has strong siege, you could defend with 4 people.  Just remember that when there are more people in a lane, each person receives less exp. So having three enemies in one lane against you gives you the advantage because the enemy team will receive less exp.  Following up on that, on Battlefields of Eternity, if one person soaks while the other 4 pushes with or defends against the immortal, the exp gain will be pretty big. EDIT: sorry for the misinformation. Exp gain is constant no matter how many people are in the lane. Nonetheless, it is still a fine strategy to have a 1/4 formation when the immortal is up.  Also, there's no such rules when you play Team League or queue as a 5 man team. You guys can try out whatever you want. That's how meta is made.  As for Murky's egg, yes it is invisible if placed in grass."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,maldrame,6,Mon Jul 20 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"Just remember that when there are more people in a lane, each person receives less exp. So having three enemies in one lane against you gives you the advantage because the enemy team will receive less exp.   This is entirely incorrect.  All experience gained is of constant value.  The count of players involved, either by proximity or by interaction, causes no change to the quantity.  The only conditional factor is whether or not the experience was earned at all.  eg, when soaking lane minions your team will gain 0 experience if no killing blows are dealt and no players are within range; and your team will get experience for 1 minion if between 1 and 5 players are present, or if a player dealt the killing blow.    The scoreboard counter for experience gathered, which is not the same counter as your team level, will attempt to distribute experience between all players involved.  Thus if four players are within soak range, their scoreboard tallies will each gain 1/4th the total experience gained from the minion.  But, again, this only applies to the scoreboard display."

This part is still correct, especially if u have some vikings soaking both while 4v5 defending immortal... youll end up 2-3 levels ahead if you do it right. I do this on johanna all the time and rarely lose on that map with that strat, prolly harder to pull off at higher levels without vikings or aba."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,henrax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:45 2015 UTC,"1/4 are standard lane formations, especially on Mines to push the boss lane. 1-1-3 and equivalents are also good to secure an early kill and rotate. You should put a good laner (Tass, Jaina, Valla, most specialists...) alone and some good ganking heroes (Zera, Nova, Kerri, Uther...) to roam from lane to lane. It is different according to your comp, the map, the enemy comp but the 2-2-1 or 2-3 formations are not always the best choices.   Overall, it's not that important as long as you have at least one hero on each lane and that good gank heroes (especially Nova) are not forced to lane alone."

NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,maldrame,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"If you're in range of a globe (roughly the same range as experience soak) when a teammate picks it up, you should see that globe ""transported"" to your hero.  That is your indication that you'll receive the same healing from the globe.  It should be noted that opponent players will also see this animation.  If you are stealthed or in a bush it will hide this animation from your opponents.  But if you stand in the fog of war and are otherwise visible the animation will still occur."

NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,Goobah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"Good habits to get into early?   It's usually better to stay grouped up from level 10 and onward. Catching people out of position is a great way to secure wins (it's the little victories that snowball into wins). Also, always be aware of positioning: stay behind tank and  don't get picked off because you were out of position.    One or two strong champions for every role?   Johanna and Muradin. Kael and Jaina. Sylvanas and Nazeebo. Malfurion/Rehgar/Uther/LiLi (all of these are viable).

This one comes from watching the most recent tournament (the NA Open? name escapes me), what's so good about Zeratul that he was banned in all but one game?   Zeratul has the best ult in the game with Void Prison. It can win team fights singlehandedly. He can also delete squishys with ease. He also forces the enemy team to play around him when drafting. He's just a overall powerful hero.    Why is Kerrigans Hero League winrate so low? (I really want to play her. ;_; )   She's incredibly squishy and was nerfed last patch (well, not technically, but Envenom and Blood for Blood were which were a large portion of her burst). She also plays the same role as Zeratul, except Zeratul is way better.    And finally, what bit of information do you wish you'd been told when you started playing this game?   Be friendly to your teammates. You'd be surprised in how much better you'll do when you start a HL game with a simple ""Hey everyone. Any preferences?"". I've won games with terrible team comps simply because we kept a positive attitude and worked together. Try to shut down potential toxic players before they get out of hand (it's OK to defend other teammates and put people in their place if necessary). A simple ""gj all"" after a won objective goes a long ways. Be the positive influence on the game and you'll see results.   Good luck."

I've played since early beta but I'd rather play bot games because I can get away with stupid stuff and still win.

NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,Ryguy_69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yes.   When all structures/objectives are even on both sides what will often determine the outcome of the game is who gets to key levels before the other side.  These key levels are 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 20.  Those are the levels that you get a new talent.  Hitting level 10 first is pretty obvious why it's so good (you get your heroic ability) but some heroes have huge power spikes at other levels, such as Kael'Thas' ignite at level 16."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,backupgoalie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:37 2015 UTC,When should I be roaming between lanes as a support? Is it just based on when teammates need healing? Should it be right before objectives so I can be there for the objective?
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,Ryguy_69,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"Never leave a lane if you're the only hero in that lane. If you have at least one teammate per lane, you can roam to whoever needs help the most. If the enemy is pushing bot lane with 3 dudes and your lone ally down there is at low health, definitely go down and help a brotha out, for example. If you are 2v1 in a lane and pushing minions towards their towers, you might want to help out a different lane. Or you could continue pushing the towers in. A lot of it just depends on team comps, map, etc... There isn't a set in stone right or wrong answer."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,backupgoalie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"Just started playing and was wondering what should a team look like and how should people set up for the various maps. I play mostly support so I try to tag along with a good damage person. Do you think support is a good role to play to learn the game or should I try everything? I make mistakes so I like champions that are forgiving (escapability and healing are great).   I seem to do good on Valla too. Any other champions like her. I seem to go with self healing and I take the talent to reset hungering arrow. I really like the combos(hungering arrow, multishot, vault, then hungering arrow again) I can pull off to blow people up at times. Would Nova be similar to Valla? Also should I avoid certain characters if they aren't played in ranked games. Also I am playing all Rehgar right now. What other supports are necessary to play and get good at? Is Li Li good. She seems ok but I don't enjoy playing her much."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,Ryguy_69,4,Mon Jul 20 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"If you want to play hero league eventually you need to be comfortable with at least 2 of each type of hero (support, assassin, warrior, and maybe specialist). But if you want to main as support that is more than fine! Most people want to play assassin so you should have no problem getting who you want.  Playing with all the heroes also gets you familiar with their abilities so you know how to play against them better.  It seems like you enjoy the burst aspect of Valla so I would recommend Jaina or Kael'thas. Maybe Falstad as well.  Nova is a bit harder to play. She excels at bursting down heroes, but she can't clear minion waves, lane against other heroes, or capture mercs very well. In order to be a good Nova you NEED to hit your skill shots and ults and kill enemy heroes or else it's like playing 4.5 v 5.  Nova plays quite a bit differently than Valla as well.  In ranked play just play who you are good at. A great Chen player is better than someone who has 3 games on Johanna.  But be wary of 1st picking the following heroes because in ranked because it forces your team to draft around you: Abathur, murky, TLV, Nova, Illidan, Thrall, Stitches, Chen, Brightwing, Tassadar, Tyrande, Gazlowe  (Might be missing a few). That does not mean that they are bad heroes, just that they have a little bit unorthodox playstyle.  If you're playing QM, pick who you want and have fun!  LiLi is a decent support. Most consider her overall weaker than rehgar, malfurion and uther. If you want to play support choose 2 of the three above at minimum. I think Rehgar and malf are on free week right now, and Uther is free starting tomorrow so you can get a good idea of who you like :)"

NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,maldrame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Forts, or Keeps?  Forts are the outer structures.  Keeps are the inner structures.  The difference is critical in that destroying keeps will spawn catapults, while Forts will not.  If forts, then go or the objective.  If Keeps, it depends on the map, the status of the objective, and the status of your team.  If gathering the objective won't pressure their team into ditching your keep (Garden seeds, Blackhearts chests, Tomb spiders), then they're a non-issue and you should probably defend the base.  If your team isn't in a situation to defend a 5-man push intelligently (you're spread out, at low health, or otherwise disorganized) go for the objective.  If their team needs to push through the wall and towers as well as Keep, you're probably safe to get the objective, given your level."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,The_Zatanna,0,Mon Jul 20 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"I believe the situation would be having 3 Forts left. Both teams are even on levels. No communication with the team, and we are on Garden.  I asked this question, because even though it was AI, it was only myself and another person communicating on the team and everyone else was pretty much doing their own thing. Garden seeds were spawning, but the guy was pinging we defend the mid Fort, and then continued to complain about how we should use the mini map.  With the team I was given....I don't believe we would have been in a position to defend intelligently and would have just been sacrifices, but he continued to say anytime when there are 5 pushing mid we should defend."
NexusNewbies,3dyb4w,maldrame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"Level ~11 is an awkward time to consider defending a 5-man push.  Prior to level 10 you'll actually want to avoid the 5 man and continue soaking lanes, since if you avoid feeding their team any kills you'll easily outpace their exp gain by staying in lane.  By level 15 you'll definitely want to defend the push, because five players will begin to chew through structures rather quickly at that point.  The 11-14 range, however, is sort of a toss up.  You may always invoke the golden rule: ""A team working in unison towards a bad idea is better off than an individual working alone towards a good idea.""  Especially when you're learning the ropes I'd suggest you default to that option.  Now, for the Garden map in particular.  Forts are good, and you don't want to burn one unnecessarily.  But they aren't so critical that you must defend every assault no matter what.  However, Garden Seeds are not a massively timely issue.  Unlike many other maps' objectives you probably won't be punished if you decline a mad rush to claim the spawns.  So if you felt you could safely defend the push, it wouldn't necessarily cost you the objective, much less the game.  But that's only if you feel you can adequately defend the push.  So which one was the correct answer?  Neither, necessarily, in this situation.  Which brings me back to the golden rule: your strongest option probably would have been the one which rallied the most allies around a single cause."

NexusNewbies,3dy8d2,Boobtape,6,Mon Jul 20 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of Chen hate right now b/c people think he's terrible, but he's actually still quite viable in HL and very fun to use if played properly. I'll start off with what I think is the best talent build right now; this build was also used by that rank 1 chen player  you've probably heard of recently.   Lvl 1: Regeneration master - As chen is primarily a sustainer (and not a great damage dealer), you want to emphasize this role by increasing your regeneration rate. Thus, you really want to collect as many regen globes (RG) as possible throughout the game and so this talent really shines on larger maps where you'll be able to gather more RGs. Lvl 4: Amplified healing - This talent is incredible in further complementing the sustainer role. Each time you get a RG or get healed by an ally, you get 30% more healing! If you're low on health, no problem, just hit up a healing fountain and heal back to almost full health. Lvl 7: Brewmaster's balance - The best talent at this level for its versatility. If you're above 50 brew, you get a significant health regen boost (adds to your sustainer role) and if you're below 50, you get 20% movement speed (great for escaping or chasing). If you're at exactly 50 brew, you gain the benefits of both!  Lvl 10: Storm, Earth, Fire - This is amazing because if you're low on health, you replace yourself with 3 full health heroes (but each at lower health) that can do a lot of damage and body blocking. Although not ideal, this is also great for escaping if you're in a dire situation. Just use your Q ability to jump further away. Remember, once this ult ends, you return to the same amount of health you were at before. Lvl 13: Relentless/A touch of honey - Relentless is usually the better choice if the enemy team has a lot of silences/stuns. Especially since your kit depends so much on your brew drinking trait. If not, a touch of honey is the next best thing. Lvl 16: Pressure Point - I'm convinced that this is the best talent because chen severely lacks good cc. You'll be able to significantly contribute to team fights and your ability to chase with this talent. Lvl 20: Elemental Conduit/Hardened Shield - Depends on the situation, if you haven't had any difficulty with sustain, go elemental conduit to increase your damage, otherwise go hardened shield.   Other general tips:   Use your Drink (D) trait liberally! Position yourself a safe distance away from the enemy, and drink right before you engage them so you have your shields up before fighting an enemy. If the enemy is familiar with chen, they'll back off and wait until your shield disappears before attacking you. Either way, you get them to back off a bit which especially helps in the laning phase (also to secure grabbing the regen globe). Get used to the Keg smash (W) > Breath of fire (E) combo so that you optimize the brew soaked damage over time! Although it doesn't seem like much, if you catch multiple enemies in your keg/breath combo, you'll deal a lot of damage overall and soften the enemy team up in team fights. Always try to be at or above 50 brew if you take brewmaster's balance. If you're at 100 brew, one quick Keg/Breath combo (20+30) will bring you to exactly 50 brew so you can take advantage of the regen rate and speed bonus. Once again, you are a sustainer more than anything, so the longer you're in a fight, the better. If you've take the above talent build, and stacked up enough RGs, you almost never need to hearth back to heal. You literally take a walk, clear out a minion wave or something, or drink from the healing fountain, and you'll be back at full health in no time. Although you fill the tank role, and should generally position yourself in the frontline, don't dive too deep into the enemy team and stick close to your team. You need your team to be able to unload the majority of the damage while you peel for them. Your flying kick is a bit buggy so it might not land sometimes. Just be aware of this. If you're escaping, and there are some enemy minions in the direction you're running towards, your flying kick will help you escape more easily."

NexusNewbies,3dzgv0,N8CCRG,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm good with random comps, but bad at drafted comps?   This can be an answer. In HL you need to be able to fit all roles and know how to make a good composition. You need to be able to adapt to your opponents and your teammates. Also HL needs way more coordination than QM. Players usually don't talk in QM and everybody is more or less doing his own thing. In HL players are more focused and try to play together as a team.   The main difference between the two is that people don't really care in QM, they play heroes they are not used to, they try new things, they warm up, they play when they are drunk and tired... So the level is higher in HL. If you play your best heroes and play as good in QM as in HL you will probably have a higher mmr in the former."

When he is on a team with a Muradin or Johanna he shines. He's great at punishing people for being out-of-position, and I've found that he is great and crushing overzealous Illidans (and really any squishy melee character that sticks around too long).  That said, he has basically no mobility, so if you are out of position, you are in trouble."

The maps are smaller so team fights erupt all the time. Objectives spawn in minutes so the 'laning phase' is very short. Don't sit in lane and farm as you would in League if the objective is up, always look to group and take them. Merc camps shouldn't be taken ASAP.   Also don't worry about champ roles in certain lanes. And don't forget to use Z."
NexusNewbies,3dxy2w,Rainuwastaken,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Nothing bat about being lazy, if someone else did a great job already :D  Does that mean, there just isn't a real meta yet, or that you can play anything everywhere, because many different playstyls/teamcombs are good?

NexusNewbies,3dxy2w,blergh_1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"That is the button to summon your mount! You have to get used to it, but once you do, you won't be able to play League without mashing it every time you want to go somewhere.  There is a meta in the pro scene, but in Quick Match it doesn't really matter. 2-1-2 is normal for the lanes. Depending on the map, you may want heroes who can control certain parts of the map. Also there are strong combinations of heroes in lane, but nothing set in stone."
NexusNewbies,3dxy2w,blergh_1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:52:41 2015 UTC,"So people in HotS are less ""tryhard-follow-the pros"" in ""normal games""? That might be pretty nice for a change. Don't get me wrong! I like playing meta in LoL, but sometimes i just want to have some more chill games ^^"
NexusNewbies,3dxy2w,sankanyo,3,Mon Jul 20 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"Same here. Plus no items means that you can pick up a hero and play them, without needing to read a guide first.

It's an attempt to prevent runaways."
NexusNewbies,3dw7gn,Captaincastle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"It has very little to do with soaking and mostly is dependent on the ordering of the kills. You could actually have 6-20 and be ahead in levels if your team died 20 times first and then killed them 6 times in a row afterwards. HotS has built-in catch-up logic in the form of an ""underdog bonus"" (which you can read about here). Basically, the team that's behind in levels gains more exp per kill, while the team that's ahead in levels gains less. So the enemy team could be stomping all game in kills, but a single good teamfight for your team can easily swing the levels back to even."

NexusNewbies,3dw7gn,sankanyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"Soaking is when you are in a lane and gaining xp. The best example is a hero like Abathur. He can place his body in bushes near the minion waves in one lane so when enemy minions die, he gets the xp.  He can ALSO put his symbiote on a minion in another lane and while he's controlling that symbiote, he gets the xp from those dying minions as well. So now he is contributing 2x the xp since he is ""in 2 lanes""."
NexusNewbies,3dw7gn,JeepCrew,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:41 2015 UTC,Oh! Like soaking exp for the team. Got it. Thanks!!
NexusNewbies,3dw7gn,sankanyo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:54 2015 UTC,"No prob, happy to help. That's exactly what it is. You are soaking up xp so it's not wasted. Now, be sure to pay attention to the rest of the game and help out teammates and such; don't just soak the whole game, but If there are no objectives and either your teammates don't need you or they are so far away that by the time you get there they would be dead, just sit in a lane and push and soak that xp :)"
NexusNewbies,3dw7gn,JeepCrew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:52 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other answers, something that often gets overlooked is the XP granted for taking out tower and forts. I see a lot of players look at that 2 levels down thing and think they've lost when in reality, it's not 2 levels because of hero kills, but two levels because the opponents won objectives and took out your forts. All it takes is a quick push between objectives and you take out their forts and suddenly your team is back in the game."
NexusNewbies,3dvh0c,DeltaDerp,8,Sun Jul 19 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"From watching some zuna stuff the things I took away from it.    Early game you want to bully people out of lanes or get early ganks.  If someone has to back or dies that's exp lost for them and potentially gained for you (if killed).  Also makes it so they are scared to push your fort.  Try to stay hidden as the easy targets are waiting for you to show your face so they know if they are safe or not.  You being on the map will have them playing cautious, if they aren't punish them, you'll need good global presence.   Help team with objectives or preventing other team from completing with pokes.  You don't need to all in, just get in, do some damage, scare them and blink out.  With back up you can stick around a little longer but usually you'll be last in trying to pick off low life people.   With VP you're trying to zone out 1-4 people to put your team into an advantageous situation.  Even if it's just their tank out with 4 in the backline caught, if everyone focuses down the tank when the VP drops that group has no defense preventing you from blowing them all up.   Zuna loves to aggressively poke once he hits 13 and picks up wormhole.  Just blink in, take a couple steps, unload, blink out to safety.  Now that person has to heal up or risk being on half/low life for a team fight.     I'm not an expert, mostly just relaying info.  While Nova seems more looking for kills, Zera seems to want to do more harassing.    Here's Zuna reviewing some of his play as Zeratul."
NexusNewbies,3dvh0c,insanemetal187,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"yep, zera is a poke machine essentially, because he can do it relatively safely and then he has VP which is probably the most powerful ability in the game, but it's also hardest to use..."

It feels selfish because it kinda is, but it is the best way to utilize Zeratul to your teams advantage. Early game roam and help your teammates control their lanes, maybe get some kills if the opposing team is careless. Once team fights start, flank the opposing team's back line, either killing or forcing them out of the fight, either way you have aided your team gain a numbers advantage. Team fight mind set: wait on edge of the fight for your opportunity, blink in, blow your rotation, wormhole back out, then repeat."

Not a team player. So I put him on the ""nope"" list and moved on. Then I saw a video by MFPallytime who plays a pretty great zeratul, and realized that the character didn't stuck at all. I did. And, moreover, I was playing him wrong. This might not be the exact video, but you can watch a couple and get the idea. https://youtu.be/0O6zKHlpZms .

With that build you can blink into the backline, cleave auto and leave and leave them with half health and all you've lost is a little mana. Wormhole's utility is just insane. Also, with a followthrough build zeratul benefits just as much as an ap build from rewind because of all the extra folowthrough procs you get and with quad bombs you can still keep up for sustained damage. Just my thoughts after a lot of time spent with zeratul."

NexusNewbies,3dvh0c,Dikus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:34:58 2015 UTC,"You should be roaming and killing. I know it doesn't seem like much considering that this isn't a deathmatch; but if you kill enemies, your teammates will have an easier laning phase and will be able to push and take out early towers and gates quicker without any pressure.  If you aren't confident enough in getting kills, just poke, harass, and zone them out a little. Your enemies will still think you can kill them (even when you can't) and get scared and back off. That means your teammates aren't getting poked, and they aren't having to go back to base to heal or whatever. More lane time, more soak time the more exp you're getting.  Quick Note: Sorry if there are run-on sentences in there. Especially if grammar bothers you. I just woke up and my brain is still asleep/melting cause of this bullshit heat."
NexusNewbies,3dvh0c,puttybutty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:15 2015 UTC,"Poking: the art of dealing damage to the opposition without the intent to kill, but to force them back and put them at a health/mana resource disadvantage.    Number one assassin rule in HOTS: Poking and not killing is better than getting killed for a kill. Zeratul is like the poke king with Wormhole. He can go in and do really fierce damage and get out alive. While getting kills is really good and should be prioritized the fact is once you learn how to effectively poke and not die with Zera you will start getting more kills. Go into every fight (even teamfights) with a poke mentality. When you get an opening to Void prison their backline (or their front if your team has superior positioning and can go around your VP) and can gain a numbers advantage you can stick around and kill Everything. But if you stay and fight in a 5v5, me and most others will prioritise quickly to stun and burst you down!"

NexusNewbies,3dukoy,Boobtape,8,Sun Jul 19 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"The recent patch removed her very powerful base stats and pile of utility options in her talent tree, and replaced them with a much weaker baseline but much stronger capacity to specialize in a particular behavior.  It's better from a design standpoint, but currently underpowered in respect to other heroes, especially other supports.  The redesign flubbed most on the damage side of things, failing to account for how much of her success was based on ability to wave clear and create aoe pressure.  The new talents not only missed an opportunity to increase the reliability of Arcane Flare, which is one of the most difficult to master skillshots in the game, they also do very little to increase AFs output in situations where players have not yet gained a mastery of the ability.  Her healing and defensive uility, on the other hand, is still quite strong despite the nerfs.  Many talents have the capacity to completely shut down an opponent player, or single handedly save an ally, with a single, well-timed skill use.  On top of that, her passive healing shows excellent synergy with many talents, making up for its low baseline stats.    At the moment she makes a better Flex healer than Core healer.  When you play QM you run the risk of landing against a team with Uther, Rehgar, Malfurion, or any mix of them plus another support.  This is a disadvantaged situation, but it is by no means unwinnable.  Keep your chin up and play to your best.  Personally I'd argue that Brightwing has always had one of the highest skill ceilings of all heroes.  Arcane Flare is, as I've said, one of the most difficult skillshots in the game.  Polymorph is one of the most powerful Crowd Control abilities in the game, but provides literally no benefit if it isn't used to interrupt a skill, protect a teammate being focused, or to secure a kill on an escaping opponent.  Pixie Dust is powerful when used with expert timing, but easily wasted otherwise.  Of her ultimates, Blink Heal is reliable and difficult to waste, but likewise provides a much smaller effect than you'd expect out of an ultimate ability.  Emerald Wind is incredibly strong but requires her to risk her personal safety to gain an optimal position before using it, and if used thoughtlessly can actually have an negative effect by disrupting a good situation for your team.  All in all, Brightwing is still very fun, and is one of the most unique characters in the game.  She's currently underpowered, which does tend to happen to heroes and she will bounce back in time.  If you don't have much experience with her or are otherwise on the fence about picking her up, I'd suggest you wait for the next patch or two to see if her situation improves before spending the gold.  If you don't own her, but have played her to level 5-6, loved her style and wanted to pick her up, don't be afraid to do so."
NexusNewbies,3dukoy,maldrame,3,Sun Jul 19 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"Since Brightwing got reworked last patch, she has been struggling.  She fell from a top 3 winrate to a bottom 5 win rate.  Her abilities are Arcane Flare (Q) which is an aoe attack that hits an area after a small delay.  Arcane flare's damage and range was recently nerfed.  Polumorph (W) silences an enemy hero for 1.5 seconds (can be spec'ed to be longer).  This is very useful against high damage dealers like Illidan, Butcher, Zeratul, Jaina and Kael'Thas.  Make sure to use polymorph on prime targets in team fights, preferrably before they have used their abilities.  Her pixie dust (E) boosts heroes' move speed and blocks one incoming basic attack.  This counters AA-heavy heroes like Valla and Raynor.  Brightwing's trait is Soothing Mist, which heals all allies in a small radius around her on a 4 second cooldown.  This does not cost mana and activates automatically.  Brightwing's Ultimates are Blink heal which lets you teleport to a nearby ally and heal them, and you can store 2 charges.  Emerald wind deals damage and pushes enemies away.    Brightwing no longer has the raw healing output to keep up with Uther/Rehgar/Malf/Lili, but she is still viable imo.  Instead of a mount, brightwing has the ability to teleport to any ally on the map on a 30 sec cooldown.  This gives her a great global presence on larger maps where she can, for example, soak exp then blink across the map to shield a friendly Valla and polymorph the Zeratul chasing her down.  Positioning is important for BW since she does not have a great escape mechanism until level 10.  She is not a frontline support like Uther or Lili where you can run in, disrupt the enemy and run back out.  You need to position yourself away from the enemy, but close enough to your team to get the most out of soothing mist.  The build I run with Brightwing currently is based on Pixie Dust and Soothing Mist to try to get the most out of her healing utility.  For level 1 talents, I usually take hyper shift or bribe depending on the map.  For level 4, if the enemy has stealthies I take Peekaboo!, otherwise I take manic pixie.  For level 7 I take mistified 80% of the time, and Cleanse if the enemy has a lot of CC.  For level 10 I almost always take blink heal.  It is your only source of burst healing and can be used as an escape if the enemy is focusing you.  Level 13 I take shield dust.  Level 16 I take bouncy dust and level 20 I take rewind.  At this point you can polymorph-Pixie dust 2 allies which increases their heal- cast arcane flare - rewind - cast pixie dust on two more allies increasing their healing amount and cast polymorph again.  BW is in a weird place right now, and after playing ~50 games pre-patch with her and ~15 post-patch, she definitely feels weaker.  Losing sprint and gust of healing hurt a lot.  Hopefully she sees some small buffs in the near future"

I will advice u to play more QMs and find a few more u like during the free rotations.   Drafts in HL usually follow 1 tank 1 healer 2/3 assassins 0/1 specialists. Sometimes its 2 tanks 1 healer 1/2 assassins 0/1 specialists. But u get the gist.  It's in the team best interest to have few top tier heroes if u get the 1st 2 picks or 1st pick. Picking up KT/Jaina/Zeratul/Sylvanas etc denies the opponent to pick them up. Unlike QM there's no mirror heroes.   Sometimes u get the last pick and usually end up with a healer or tank pick. Even if u're not great at heal/tank its still better going in with one than no heals/tank at all.

NexusNewbies,3dv13a,thekaz,2,Sun Jul 19 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"When he says ""bracket"", he's using it colloquially. To be more specific, he's talking about your Ranking. In the first case, he means rank 50-40, in the second case, rank 30-20."

NexusNewbies,3dv13a,kelminak,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'm only decently ranked atm (9-10) in Hero League, but quite frankly, I would hold off on Hero League until you're confident in playing at least two champions in every single role. You don't want to be stuck in a position where you're forced to play an assassin, pick someone who you have no idea how to play, then end up costing the game for your team. Due to the bonus boost that is given when you start hero league, it doesn't give an incentive to hop into ranked when you can hold off, get better, and then start playing ranked to maximize how far you can push with it.  For perspective, I blew my entire point advantage with a ten game losing streak in ranked at the start and have had to slowly climb my way out of those lower levels to get to where I'm at now. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. Learn what is overpowered and abuse it from the start to push your rank as high as possible."

Do try to learn all the heroes you have though, and try to have a good mix of roles as its more about fitting into a team comp than anything.  At the rank 50-40 mark most people are fresh into HL too. Prepare for toxicity unfortunately. Try to stay positive and stay out of arguments. Once you break under 30 things get a lot nicer."

NexusNewbies,3dv13a,ultimateballoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:25 2015 UTC,You'll quickly learn that quick match and hero league are different games. You'll learn new strategies and skills from a pool of mostly better players than you get in quick match. You're punished harder for your mistakes and learn from them more. These skills are transferable to quick match.
NexusNewbies,3dtu83,reshits,10,Sun Jul 19 12:07:06 2015 UTC,"Basically you want to be able to look at the map and paint a picture in your mind through fog of war.  Enemy players: can you see all 5? Are they bunched? Did zeratul just rotate up from bot? If you can't see all 5, assume they are en route to fuck you up. Are you confident in your ability to engage or retreat?  Objectives: are they up? How long has it been since they were up? Where are the enemies when the objective spawns? If there's 4 capping bot shrine, and you can see all 4, react accordingly. Are they all pushing top and the tribute spawned bottom?  Merc camps: Do you have time to grab nearby camps in between objectives? If you can't see all the enemies, it's a solid bet they're getting a camp, if there's no objective.  Pings: indicating danger? Can you see nova/zeratul? If not, they're probably at that ping. Know when to go assist the 1v3 bot vs trust your team to fall back while the other 4 grab a boss. A ping doesn't demand a response.  This is just going to take time. Recognizing when to rotate to support a heavy push, or when it's time to roam/gank, or how many people to send to objectives. The best you can do is just try and build that awareness a little at a time.   Got a moment to breathe? Stay safe, spend 10 seconds scanning the map for your next move. Speed is important, but a slow shot that hits is better than a fast shot that misses. You being 10 seconds late to shrine because you did recon and avoided enemies is better than running straight into a trap and having to hearth or worse, die."
NexusNewbies,3dtu83,Captaincastle,4,Sun Jul 19 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"Team fights or smaller skirmishes sometimes happen just off your screen, but you can see them on the minimap.  Watching pings, objective pops, and making sure you know where the enemy has visibility on the way to an objective can also be included.  You can set a repeating timer at http://www.online-stopwatch.com/ for about 15 seconds or so and build the habit of looking at the minimap that often.  This was a tip in one of Woundar's videos, to give credit where it's due."
NexusNewbies,3dtu83,angrmgmt00,4,Sun Jul 19 13:18:40 2015 UTC,"While there's a lot of good advice here, I must stress that it's equally important to be aware of where your teammates are. Just because you might see them on your screen does not mean you're working together.   For example, you'll both be running in the direction of the shrine, and you're leading the way. So you might assume they're going to shrine with you. If you're only looking for enemies on the minimap, you'll see 2 at the shrine and be fairly confident that you can win the 2v2. If you're looking for your team as well, you'll see that you're running into a 1v2 because your teammate decided to stop at the merc camp along the way."
NexusNewbies,3dtu83,cthomlan,2,Sun Jul 19 15:23:31 2015 UTC,Player count: If the number of dead enemy heroes plus the number of visbile enemy heroes is less than five then you play carefully and don't push alone.
NexusNewbies,3dtu83,dragbone,2,Sun Jul 19 12:44:20 2015 UTC,"Map awarness is like you said looking at the mini map but also keeping track of the enemies. Basically if you can't see all 5 enemy heroes on the mini map you should still have a general idea where they are.  This might be a little bit hard at the beginning but you'll get better at it the more you play. If you see 3 enemy heroes on the bot lane and they suddenly vanish from the minimap and you are overextending on the mid lane to push, the enemy is most likely running towards you. This is just one of the many examples that you can use for your advantage.  So the basic concept is predicting where the enemy is/is going to even if you can't see them. This is a experience based skill meaning the more you play the better you'll get at it. At the beginning it might not be as important, but if you want to learn it always think about what the best play for the enemy would be and then react according to that."
NexusNewbies,3dtu83,MADBEE,2,Sun Jul 19 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"One of the more simple things is just keeping an eye on your team. Especially during the early laning phase, you need to see when your team is getting grouped up on and move out to help them as soon as possible."

NexusNewbies,3dsqzn,MortalPhantom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:55:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! Any guides for how to best compose a premade 5man team in the current meta?
NexusNewbies,3dsqzn,MortalPhantom,2,Sun Jul 19 05:32:10 2015 UTC,"Well, that guide is pretty valid for any meta, but talking about the current meta in particular which is based on burst I'd tell you the following.  Burst heroes, specially mages like Kaelthas and jaina are very strong right now and they should be prioritized when picking assassins. Because of how thir skills are designed, in which  their main source of damage is in the form of aoe atacks, you benefit from having heroes that can lock the enemies down or put them where you want to. Johanna synergizes evry well with these kind of heroes as she pull them in and then the mages nload everything on the enemy. She also is very tanky and capable of surviving the burst of the enemy. Muradin is also a good choice for basically the same reason.  Becuase there is so much burst. You will need burst healers, like Rehgar and Uther, that can heal your squishy heroes fast. Sustain healers like malfurion can work if the enemy isn't going full furst (like..kaelthas+jaina+zeratul), or when mixed with other heroes, like malfurion+tassadar shield.  Because you don't want burst healers to negate a lot of your damage, you'll also want to fill your team with a sustained damage dealer, it can be heroes like zagara-valla-falstad-sylvanass etc that will force the enemy healers to use their heals on other stuff and not only your burst.  And thats kinda how things work right now.  There are also dive comps, like when you pick tyrael and use judgement or pick Anub'arak and then come in with the butcher and tyrande and just kinda jump all over the enemy team, which work nice agaisnt the mages in particular but requiere a little more cordination. Also Zeratul is a good counter to the mages, nova too, but I recommend zeratul because he brings more overall utility."
NexusNewbies,3dsxhy,hobskhan,3,Sun Jul 19 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"It's a reference to the global skill cool down in WoW. GCD, the time it takes in between spell casts where you're just auto attacking"
NexusNewbies,3dsxhy,fanboyhunter,3,Sun Jul 19 05:11:29 2015 UTC,Two things.  1) Global as in global range. Anywhere on the map.  2) Global as in Global Cooldown  (GCD). The short time between casting spells. So to global someone means to kill them VERY quickly.
NexusNewbies,3dsxhy,HelloImDr3w,2,Sun Jul 19 05:19:48 2015 UTC,It's slang for killing someone before they are able to do anything. As you can see the Murky had no shot at life. Jaina basically killed him instantly.
NexusNewbies,3dsxhy,hacdladf1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"Little more detail than others - In World of Warcraft, there is a global cooldown- basically a delay after using ANY spell, before you can use any other spell, even if they are 2 instant cast spells with no cooldown.  By default I think it was 1.5 seconds for most classes. If this didnt exist, you could spam a spell (for example, Ice Lance) unlimited times in a certain timeframe.  If an enemy used an ability, you'd know they had 1.5 seconds before they could do another ability- if you could 100-0 someone in this time-frame, it was literally impossible for them to do anything- all their abilities would be on 'global cooldown'.  So killing someone so fast that they literally have no chance to respond was referred to as 'globalling' them."

That is fantastic, I rarely see other Aba's do that. Keep that up. Symbiote. You seemed to use it on creeps quite often. Personally, I save it for ally heroes in fights. That cooldown after you exit a Symbiote and needing to apply it elsewhere can get people killed if you don't get to them fast enough. Mines. I don't think I saw you using them more than two or three times. They can do wonders. Put them in high-traffic areas, for example. Like in Blackheadt Bay: around the turn-in chest, around the reap awning chests or camps, or in high traffic areas. I also noticed you'd burrow next to a bush, being exposed for a second. Placing a Mine into the bush gives you vision, allowing you to burrow completely undetected. My point is you should constantly be throwing mines whenever your Symbiote isn't needed.  Your Ultimate. I saw you use it only once. Monstrosity I use fairly often, even if I don't decide to control it. It can wreck keeps well enough on its own, and should it have decent health and have 20 creep kills, it can do serious hero damage.    If you want me to clarify anything, let me know!"
NexusNewbies,3dswco,AC_Mobius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:22:10 2015 UTC,"Symbiote. You seemed to use it on creeps quite often. Personally, I save it for ally heroes in fights.   I generally use that for soaking up even more xp (i.e. body soak + symbiote soak) when it looks like my own teammates are relatively safe. That said, yeah, it is risky so I'm going to reevaluate my ""jumpiness"" when it comes to symbiote.   I also noticed you'd burrow next to a bush, being exposed for a second. Placing a Mine into the bush gives you vision, allowing you to burrow completely undetected.   Oh, dang, had no idea you could do that! For some reason, didn't make the connection even though I've placed them in bushes before :s That's something I'll definitely be using from now on. I see what you mean about mine usage though, I definitely need to use them more/better since even when I do, it's usually to push a wave instead of more.   Your Ultimate. I saw you use it only once. Monstrosity I use fairly often, even if I don't decide to control it.   Ah, yeah, initially I think I saw the waves pushed far, so I decided to save Monstrosity for a bit (hoping to use it when the wave was nearer to us so that it was safer for it to grow) but then I forgot about using it for a long time. And looking at my other replays, under-using my ult as an Abathur seems to be a pattern with me, so that's something I'll try to work on.  Thanks a lot for the tips!"

Take demonic invasion and use it to come, take down a fort and leave. Use your trait to push lanes you're not in and try to learn when to be with your team and when not to. With your lazer you should be anyone in 1v1 (especially Illidan, have a blast with him), especially after lvl 13. Don't hesitate to back when you don't have mana. The most important skill with Azmo played like this is map awareness : always know if enemies are coming for you and disappear before they arrive. You have literally no way to escape if you back too late.  High level : The only viable gameplay for Azmo at 3k+ mmr level is taste for blood and black pool. You need teammates to help you get stacks on your Q so you need an organized and cooperative team. Aka don't take taste for blood in solo Q, it isn't as good as sieging wrath if you don't get stacks.  To play against him, you need to catch him and kill him if he tries to push alone. You often need to be 2 to get him, and solo Nova is pretty much useless against him. But you don't need to be 5, he has no escape so any decent ganking squad should be enough. It's good to kill his minions quickly so they don't do too much damage."
NexusNewbies,3dqf6m,henrax,2,Sat Jul 18 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"split push    Is that like, dunking on mid while pushing top/bot with DW/GoH?"
NexusNewbies,3dqf6m,xm00g,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It's basically pushing where the opposite team is not. You can deal huge amount of damages to buildings in very short amounts of time. So if you see your minions hitting a building without any enemy hero, just unleash your army of hell, take the fort or the door down and leave. Then find somewhere else. Also if you are pushing somewhere and you see another lane deserted, use your trait (and your dunk if it's not too far) on it.   This strategy is good in low to average mmr, where enemies won't be able to counter you efficiently. Always be very careful and stay far if you have the slightest doubt about where the enemies are."
NexusNewbies,3dqf6m,henrax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"For high level play, how do you counter say a Johanna (KtP) and Azmo (TfB) who are building stacks up early game? Recently had a game against this and couldn't figure out what to do"
NexusNewbies,3dqf6m,Omnobo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:58 2015 UTC,"It's not easy. The fact is while they do that they are not doing anything else. Which means that there is probably a damage dealer alone in his lane, that you can gank. I think you need one strong laner to counter them (Zagara seems a good fit) and try to gain an advantage on the other two lanes."
NexusNewbies,3dqf6m,henrax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/henrax said, they are also going to be pretty weak in the early game until they get those stacks.  Gank the other lanes early and often, and try to get a big xp lead early.  Basically, if you can get a Keep or two down before Azmo finishes his stacks, you win."

You will likely never meet them again, and if you do, they won't remember you.  Another tip:  Tell people you're new at the start.  Anyone who starts flaming, mute immediately.  Everyone else is cool, and may actually help you!  Final tip:  Nothing anyone else thinks about you matters.  This tip applies almost unilaterally.  Going for an interview and worried the interviewer won't like you?  Cool, you wouldn't have fit in there anyway.  Asking someone out on a date, but maybe they won't dig your style?  Great, one less bad relationship to worry about."

NexusNewbies,3dnkf2,nakagro,6,Sat Jul 18 04:21:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to bolster your confidence.  This is a game. It's designed to be fun (for us and make money for the company). In my experience with HotS so far, I have come up against a-holes, jerks, trolls, etc way less than in other MOBAs I have played (Smite, LoL several years ago, etc).  That said, there will be some obviously.      Just get in there. Get in, do your best, learn new strategies and lose bad habits. Playing that many games against the AI, while making you more comfortable with heroes, probably isn't preparing you to face humans as much as you would think. Be prepared for some rough times breaking bad vs AI habits. People may call you out, but so what?  Let them be annoyed. There's no reason that you should be afraid of enjoying a game simply because of what other people playing the same game may say. Obviously if you are a true detriment to your team, things might be a little different and the amount of work to get better may be increased, but everyone had to learn the game at some point and I don't think anyone has nothing left to learn.      Play the game. Enjoy yourself, have fun, and try to win. People being jerks is their problem, not yours. There's usually some LFG threads floating around you could post in to find like-minded players to play with. Learn together, let them know you are open to constructive critiquing."

With your hero/map experience, you're probably better than a lot of players in QM already. 2. You're only reinforcing bad habits by sticking to vs AI. You'll never open yourself up to the challenge that will force you to improve. 3. What's the worst that can happen?! You don't lose anything for losing in QM; there's no visible ranking system. 4. QM games are supposed to be fun/casual and provide a sort of training grounds for hero league. That's where shit can get intense."

This is the internet, this is online gaming...people are going to be mad.  I was pretty nervous my first few games in QM because I know I'm new to the genre, and I figured I'd be playing with a bunch of super elite pro MLG bros and all that.  What I found was that...yeah, you occasionally get people who are only interested in insulting their teammates and such, but on average, most people are just pretty quiet.  It also helped to notice my own personal improvement.  Sure, I made mistakes and got called out for them, but I learned and improved, and started noticing the kind of stuff I was doing being done by others.  The point there being that nobody is perfect, and nobody plays perfectly.  Chances are, you're probably better than you give yourself credit for.  In the land of anonymity, it's really easy to call someone out for what you perceive to be a huge mistake...but try not to worry about it, it's just a symptom of the internet."

The game is more or less designed so you win half your matches and lose the other half. So you will win and then your next match will be harder and you will lose and the next easier and you'll win and so on. Just focus on your game, learn and get better.  Like others said just go out there and have fun. Think of the other players as bots. Sometimes they are.

At first, try getting a full team of friends together. People you know won't be judgmental or rude. But the biggest things that helped me are these:   Play to improve, not to win. Don't worry about whether you win or lose. Just try to recognize what your mistakes were and learn from them. If you learn something from a game, you've taken something away from it regardless of what the scoreboard says. Keep in mind, you won't remember this game tomorrow. Yeah, it may suck to get stomped. Yeah, teammates may be assholes. But you won't remember that asshole tomorrow and it's unlikely you'll ever have to play with them again.   It's just a game.

It actually happened on league first, very suddenly. I'd freeze up, get this big pit in my stomach, and wouldn't actually wanna hit ""Play""...I'd make an excuse to myself and go jump on a different, less competitive game.  I don't wanna disappoint all of those people if I play bad. I don't want to be the cause of a wipe. I don't want people yelling at me.  The BEST thing you can do, is exposure therapy. Jump in, and play hard.  You are going to fail  People are going to yell at you  You are going to under perform  But these are all of the keys you need to improvement.  If you play bad, you might feel bad for a minute, but go take a look at your replay. Watch yourself. See what you can do better. See where you made your mistakes.  If you do that, you'll be better. If you're playing better, people will be less likely to be irritated..But everyone has to learn.  I recommend learning with someone else too. If you have a friend, meet someone on reddit, or even the ingame channel /reddit..You can share your wins/losses with someone else for a bit and bounce ideas off of each other :)"

NexusNewbies,3dodjr,blergh_1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly not the most experienced player myself but these are some of the things I had to learn the hard way when starting QM:  Learn to and when to take the creep camps and especially bosses.   Against the AI you don't have to think much about it because you're usually a couple of levels ahead and don't really need them to win or care if the AI gets them.  Against human players they can be the edge you need to get ahead 1 level and become far more important.   They can also be certain doom if you're careless and get picked off in the jungle when you intend to creep alone.  Related to that: Learn to stay with the team when teamfighting starts, e.g. don't soak xp top when they are all moving in to contest the enemy boss attempt. Be aware of the minimap and keep track of where the enemy team members are.  Lastly: Let the tank/warrior engage and soak damage and don't take front with a squishy like Jaina if you're not sure you can get out alive. Bad positioning in a team fight can loose you the game once respawn times become really long!"
NexusNewbies,3dodjr,MEATER78,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:55 2015 UTC,"Learn to and when to take the creep camps and especially bosses.    I'll add, learn when not to as well. The AI has fixed minute marks when it will push camps, and sometimes that happens when a Tribute is up for grabs or something. But it'll be super focused on the camp and sometimes you can't even ping them away from it."
NexusNewbies,3dodjr,N8CCRG,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"Take talents that will let you escape like blink, especially if the character lacks natural escape abilities.  Don't necessarily take talents that increase damage over survivability, example Raynor; taking ""Seasoned Marksmen"" over ""Give Me More!"" is a stand out example.  When you are low on health, and you've got a teammate who can soak, hearth back to base and top off.  Even more important if the enemy team has gankers like Zeratul or Nova looking to exploit you.  You don't need to fight over the minions if you are 1v2 in a lane.  Just stay safe and nearby, let the minions kill each other and soak that experience up.  There is no reason to force a fight to happen or to try and kill an enemy player than.  In bot matchs, you can ignore your team and should win with everyone being a lone wolf.  Not in Quick Match, if your team has a plan, follow it, one bad plan is better than two good ones.  Sure say ""i think trying to capture the boss while all five enemy members are alive is bad.""  But if they're gonna do it anyway, just go along with it, they're sure to lose if they go 4v5."
NexusNewbies,3dodjr,thepandrake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"I can't stress this enough: when laning in the beginning, it is a terrible idea to engage with the event heroes in your lane. Never take damage you can avoid or prevent. It will save you having to use your sippy cup and not have it available later when you need it or having to go back to base to heal. It's ok to just stand in lane and get experience. If they start poking at you, back off and come back in.    That being said, it is a fantastic idea to poke them when possible especially if you can avoid taking damage. Making them leave lane to heal up gives your team a nice head start early on."

NexusNewbies,3dmk2h,Boobtape,7,Fri Jul 17 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"Just recently played Arthas 25 times in a row, with an OK QM record of 14-11. Heres what I learned.  Playing With -   Make sure you shut off Frozen Wastes when it's not doing anything..Don't..leave it on. you'll find yourself out of Mana faster than you'd ever anticipate. You need to hit your Howling Blast, much like hitting a Nova Snipe. Without it, you're kited extremely easily and cannot really gap close. Save your Frostmourne Hungers ability for immediately after an auto attack. You will hit once and then immediately strike again for a good bit of burst damage. While I took Army of the Dead pretty regularly for survival, Sindragosa is apparently the superior ability. Use it to initiate, especially around structures. It freezes them for a long time and can allow a fight under, which is unexpected. Death Coil should be used as a finisher, otherwise use it to replenish health if you're just sitting idle. More sustain is nice.   Playing Against:   Kite Arthas, He doesn't have anything to speed him up, and only Sindragosa or getting caught too long in Frozen Tempest is going to slow you down. Stay on the move constantly to avoid the Howling Blast, getting locked up by Arthas is bad news. When you Engage Arthas, don't assume you can zero him out quickly. He has a LOT of health..and a lot of potential for more health. Don't chase. Just kite him back and poke him relentlessly..Eventually he'll have to leave. Get the heck out of Frozen Wastes. It does a lot of damage quickly, and the slow stacks a lot quicker than you'd assume. It's a good zoning tool for Arthas, but it drains a lot of mana. Let yourself get zoned until the engagement is ready. Did I mention Kite Arthas? Kite Arthas."

Triple tap is awesome and once u get to level 20 and it has instant reload if it kills the hero can take out a whole team if you plan your shots correctly and wait til they are at half health or so. In fact I don't think I've ever lost a QM if we make it to level 20 because that talent feels so overpowered.  Best tip overall though I would say is plan your burst, stick and move, don't attack someone if they're at full health. You are there to finish them off not start the fight.  Again I've been playing for less than 2 weeks so take all that with a grain of salt."

I'd put him at a 9 because new players have terrible positioning and map awareness which means Kael is going to die a lot. The lack of an escape to cover up bad positioning makes him extremely difficult to use for a new player.
NexusNewbies,3dmgzl,SpudSmusher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:37:26 2015 UTC,that's a fair comment. I originally scaled it based on [E] and the phoenix can zone out the opposition.. I'll rethink it though and might go up to an 8 potentially.  Thanks for the feedback

NexusNewbies,3dlbvx,only_your_enemy,6,Fri Jul 17 05:01:15 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what your teammates are doing and which immortal phase it is.  The first immortal is quite weak and he likely wont even be able to take a tower / gate down before you down him, so it might be better to have two people lane soaking (or a viking soaking both) while you harass the enemy at your immortal with no real intention of doing anything but draw out the fight for a better soak.  But after the initial one its more important to win, and it can be done both ways, I personally feel like defending first with a cc heavy comp like mura/johanna/uther/etc gives you an advantage as you can catch them in the immortals aoe attacks occasionally giving u an advantage, and if you down one enemy you can push to their immortal and secure the objective.  Of course, if you are already winning all the team fights and have the lvl advantage or you are level 10 they are 9 still, or you just downed one of them in a battle before the immortals popped, pushing straight to their immortal makes sense.  Personally, I feel like in QMs with randoms, its a win strategically if you can even get everyone to show up at one place and work together for any objective, no matter what the strategy lol."
NexusNewbies,3dlbvx,spyxy_kt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"On this map fights are more important than objectives. That's why you don't want to fight under their immortal, and attack unless some of them are dead or you have a clear xp advantage. If you manage to let them come and stun then under your immortal, most of the time you will win. Then you will have all the time in the world to get it.  Also, it's good to soak during the first immortal, one or two stay in lane and the rest poke at them safely."
NexusNewbies,3dlbvx,henrax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:02:53 2015 UTC,"If you have more dps than them, and if they are content to attack your immortal, just attack theirs and out race them.   If they have more dps than you, or if they are trying to pick a fight, harass them at your immortal, hopefully you can knock out their assassins with help from your immortal.   But as always, it's better to make a poor decision as a group than an optimal one alone."

NexusNewbies,3dlbvx,henrax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:51 2015 UTC,Entirely depends on the setup. If your team has a lot of burst you could go dps their immortal and fall back to defend if the enemy team comes for yours. If not it makes more sense to defend yours and then go poke theirs whenever the enemy team is down.
NexusNewbies,3dlbvx,Boobtape,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"If you got a kill or heavy pressure on the team before immortals and they are respawning/going to heal up, you should take that opportunity to get damage in and get a lead/force them to defend.    But assuming you're going in on level ground, your team should meet up at your immortal and then feel out how the team fight will go. It's always better to fight in a defensive position because your immortal provides aOE stuns/damage so you have a great advantage.    If you're attacking the enemy immortal, your tank/support should probably scout. They won't do that much damage, and it's better to know where the enemy is.    Don't chase too hard, and don't feel pressured to immediately end the fight. There's no real rush to down the immortal as long as you control the fight. Use the nearby fountain in the middle of your base for quick mana/health, or B back during the 50% phase change or if you get an opening while enemy team falls back.    As long as you keep your team up, and together you should be fine."

This is my lowest winrate map at 35%, with the next map cursed hollow at 47%.  The gap is real.  Last game I played we got stomped when opposing team ignored first immortal, giving them a 2 level advantage from soaking.  I will try this strategy next time."
NexusNewbies,3dlbvx,hubife23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:21:38 2015 UTC,My observation is that in the beginning it's useless to defend because the respawn time is negligible. IMO better to go offense in the beginning. Later rounds when the respawn take longer you can defend first.
NexusNewbies,3dinro,arcanis_hots,7,Thu Jul 16 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"•Regen globes: The mage in the middle of minion waves gives you a regen globe (RG) for health and mana. If safe, always try to focus the mage first and grab the RG. I can't tell you how many times I've had allies just flat out ignore the RG. Even if you're at full health, it is always helpful to restore a bit of mana. If you know your allies have taken regen master, conjurer's pursuit, or mana addict (talents that improve mana/health regen per globe) and they're coming to your field of vision, try to wait a bit until they're near before you take the RG. (unless of course they're far away and not coming towards you). A little can go a long way especially in long drawn out games.

I've only indulged in probably two online games and the rest have been A.I. I'm honestly too nervous to jump in there.  I'm at lv 25 now, so that's good. But when did you start playing online with others? Do you have buddies you play with? Did you tell people you were new and asked for advice?"
NexusNewbies,3dinro,The_Zatanna,4,Fri Jul 17 01:25:13 2015 UTC,I am too new to give much good advice and this guy gave a few nice pieces of general knowledge.  I've been playing w IRL friends who taught me some of this stuff day one but not everyone has that privilege.  I want to address your fear of QM.  It's called quick match for a reason.  Your absolutely 100% developing bad habits playing AI so much.  Stop it.  Play QM and get flamed you will learn much more.  Look at the looking for group or looking for more feature and play w strangers.  A lot of them are really awesome and if you have a headset you'll meet a ton of good players w patience to help you.
NexusNewbies,3dinro,duhhhhhderek,3,Fri Jul 17 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely agree with you on this. Vs AI is good to just get familiar/comfortable with the hero's abilities and talent builds for a couple games, but any more than that develops bad habits, and doesn't challenge you to improve. You need to put yourself out there and play some QM games without any expectations of winning, but with all the intention of doing your best and learning. When I first started playing as Jaina, I must've lost 5 games straight in QM, with a kill/death ratio of 1:5 each game before I finally won. From there, as I learned the hero more, my win ratio gradually increased. And with each death, I learned the importance of intermediate strategies like positioning, timing, which heroes I had synergy with, etc."

A friend yelled at me to stop playing AI, and I discovered that most people suck just as much as I do.  The biggest hurdle at that point was accepting that for every game I won (increasing my rating) I probably had a loss in my future (which would lower my rating) until I get good enough to overcome the people who suck a bit less than I do."

My Mic was one of the peripherals I bought right away when I started playing CSGO.    The things you listed about vs AI aren't things you learn.  You listed things you do and all of them you can do in QM.  I recommend you use hotslogs.com to look up the most played build for a character and then QM it a couple matches.  Once you get the hang of the popular build you'll notice certain talents can and should be swapped out based on map, enemy composition, and the situation your team is in when you ding that talent.    AI do not behave the way humans do.  They won't make the same style of mistakes or the same style of good plays.  Your not going to learn normal human movement or team tactics."
NexusNewbies,3dinro,The_Zatanna,2,Fri Jul 17 12:14:32 2015 UTC,I think i started playing qm around player level 10. Whenever friends are on I party with them but I mostly play solo. When I started I remember asking for advice in game but most people are too busy playing to type. I learned a lot by scouring through Reddit and hotslogs (popular talent builds and tips). I remember thinking nova was really cool to play and saw a teammate demolish the enemy wih nova. I rewatched the replay and studied how they played as nova. I think I learned the most simply through experience and watching replays.

You're right though, I'm going to start looking at moves and playthroughs with some people I've enjoyed playing with.   I think that's another reason I haven't QM is because I haven't found a hero I really want to stick with. AI has helped me try out hero abilities and such. I've saved about 20,000 in gold, but I'm sure I can level up characters quicker on QM than on AI right?   Thank you!"
NexusNewbies,3dinro,The_Zatanna,2,Fri Jul 17 10:47:34 2015 UTC,"Just go in QM and try. At first you will be matched with beginners like you. You will win some games and lose some. You will get flamed sometimes, and sometimes you will get really nice teammates. This games is 10x more fun with real people, so don't be shy and go out there.

NexusNewbies,3dinro,JeepCrew,2,Fri Jul 17 10:52:16 2015 UTC,"Hey this was extremely helpful. I'd love to see what other tips you have.  I didn't know it was the mage that dropped the RG and I realized I too click on the boss instead of autoattacking. I don't often get hit, but sometimes I will be a bit slow.  Do you have any big tips for when to get mobs or what to do if you get a huge disadvantage early?"
NexusNewbies,3dinro,onewing_z,2,Thu Jul 16 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"Glad to help =). I'll post a list of more comprehensive tips soon. But for now to answer your questions in a nutshell, generally for mobs (i'm assuming you mean mercenary camps) you want to time them so that you CAP them ~10 seconds before objectives pop up. This way you have enough time to travel to the objective and the mercs are heading down the lane. This forces the enemy team to decide whether to defend (and in doing so split up their team to make it more difficult to take objective) or let their forts get pummelled and later force them to work on re-pushing that lane. An exception would be Mines: you want to cap the friendly seige camp as soon as the enemy golem is passing through their gates (the one closest to the centre of the map). This way your siege mercs will attack the enemy golem safely from behind your own gate (This will probably be very difficult to coordinate on QM). Although this is the ideal time to take mercs, and a lot of advice lists suggest this, practically it may be difficult to do, especially if your own team or enemy team is just blindly taking all the camps. The next best thing then is to just take camps when you have a numbers advantage (enemy team is down a couple players). Although you might not get much push out of it, at least you are denying your enemy team those camps, and they now have to spend time defending. As for your next question, thats a bit harder to answer tbh and I'll try to include it in my next post."
NexusNewbies,3dinro,KoolKid14,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"Great tips.  I know a lot of new players don't know that the mage drops the RGs and even then, more don't know what it does or that they should grab it.  I play with some friends and one just started playing and he stands next to or walks right past them all the time.  I now bug him about it and point it out when I see it so he can get in the habit of grabbing them :P"
NexusNewbies,3dklpz,spyxy_kt,6,Fri Jul 17 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"Jugs is shitty in pro matches because the roles are set and one person has the role of destroying jugs, not everyone on their team is holding all their stuns waiting for you to pop jugs. People are sheep and think they are gods at this game and everything in high level matches applies to them. They lack the critical thinking to realise some things just aren't the same. Jugs is great, with good positioning you can make yourself near impossible to hit or interrupt against even a pretty good team.  I play a lot of Li Li now since Brightwing was my go to support before the changes, but I leave the role of damage to my assassins and warriors so I haven't played her serpent build. Recently I did have a Li Li on my team that took the serpent build and she had hero damage numbers rivaling our assassins, but that was because she basically avoided healing as much as possible and saved her mana for her dps. We lost that match because she was flaming the entire match and our Tyrael was chasing pigeons all match instead of helping our back line which should have been Li Li's job. So our assassins weren't able to do anything the entire match. Even with that experience I do think the build is very good, just don't be a dick and remember that you are there for healing primarily and damage is secondary."

This is definitely what im afraid of happening, it seems like it would turn her into more of a hybrid healer occasional burst from jugs, just trying to think of what comp it would be good to run with and against... if you can turn your healer in a decent solo laner that could be pretty powerful I feel, but not if it means shit heals/support the entire match...   Jugs is shitty in pro matches because the roles are set and one person has the role of destroying jugs   This I can completely understand, I still feel like forcing even that one player to hold a stun can be beneficial, but obviously at top levels this advantage falls off, and even at pro levels they can only hold it for so long in some situations, especially if they are getting pressured hard. I definitely feel like this won't even be an issue until pretty high level play.  I feel its like smoke bomb in wow, at high level play it forces you to hold out on trinketing indefinitely sometimes, which can really fuck you over, the ability itself can be countered easily if you're prepared, but being forced to save an important ability for it really can hurt in the long run, and definitely gives that skill value even if it goes unused."
NexusNewbies,3dklpz,hacdladf1,2,Fri Jul 17 04:03:22 2015 UTC,"So I've been trying out the serpent build and it's pretty good honestly. This is my usual Li Li build. I never had any problems with it. High healing, low damage, no mana problems whatsoever if I focused on healing and blinding when necessary.  This is how I built the serpents. I would have similar healing numbers at the end of the match and something like 20-30k+ more hero damage. And most importantly I didn't feel like I was ever lacking heals in the middle of a team fight. The heal over time is really the only talent I took that increased my healing output and that's offset by the serpent healing. The cleanse was nice, but if you're going with a serpent build you might as well literally double the efficiency of it. The first serpent talent for the extra duration is irrelevant once you get Kung Fu Hustle and the mana provided by Conjurer's Pursuit is invaluable because you're spamming your Q and your W instead of only your Q.  It also made me much more effective at dueling. I've killed 3 or 4 people at the shrines in the past few days on Dragon Shire because they thought they could kill me 1v1. It used to be me running around on the shrine until one of us ran out of mana or had a team member come, but now I am an actual threat."
NexusNewbies,3dklpz,memith,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:08:40 2015 UTC,The serpent build used to be bugged and it made you heal for an absurd amount. Anyone who had the serpent basically didn't lose health. It was so popular at the time that hotslogs still shows it as the top build.  The bug has been fixed so the serpent build is not worth doing anymore.
NexusNewbies,3djsas,Balalenzon,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"seems like you are doing a lot of hybrid builds, I don't like them. I much prefer to either go full locust push build or full symbiot build. Hybrid builds can work but you're still half-assing two roles in stead of focusing on one.   Also I have an oddly high pick rate of UE compared to other talents. You really should go monstrosity with symbiot and hybrid builds. UE really only makes sense with a full push build."

The thing I think with abathur is, you have to have an entire 5 man team built around him to make it work. Basically your whole team has to be on the abathur train. I noticed he makes it really difficult for objectives that require pickups off the ground, like the spider map or pirates, or mines... basically almost all the maps... as having another body there just to pickup helps a ton.  I would like to know what comps to run with him as well, as whatever we were trying with him wasnt working for shit... I think you also need to have at least one very good auto attack assassin running with him, like butcher / illidian / zeratul to make good use of his hat, which we of course stupidly didnt have.  I personally want to try something like an abathur / zeratul combo, with johanna / jaina / uther or lili as laners... have abathur hat zeratul and just get power harass going the whole match. This should hopefully get you off on solid footing, and still be really strong late game.

Monstrosity gets thrown on a lane during map events, and the hat gets thrown on a strong DPS to help kill the other team. That way our team gets a really strong push on a lane (monstrosity usually takes down a tower...or four), while our frontline DPS gets extra beef from the hat. I also generally soak another lane with my body while this is going on, so our team gets tower xp and two lanes of xp while the event is going.  I am curious though, what are the ""counters"" to Aba?

I think the main reason is because your team is simply down a body in team fights, and unless youre team significantly outskills the other team, being down a man for objectives really really sucks... its one less damage sponge in the field, one less body blocker, one less coin picker upper, one less everything.  On the other hand, I feel if your team knows how to team fight really really well, I can see him being a great asset, but you literally have to have all 4 other players knowing when to commit, when to retreat, not over extending, etc.  I bet hed be really good on a few maps, like immortals where you can lane soak super easy while defending the immortal, but any map that requires heavy team fighting and just people being in the right location at the right time (and especially when it requires more than one loc at a time), like dragonshire, blackhearts bay, spider queen, and well, pretty much every map but one or two, he feels like heavy weight for the team especially until late game, and sometimes then it gets even worse if he is a terrible abathur..."
NexusNewbies,3djsas,binbrun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"Do you soak XP? I see that you usually go for symbiote builds. From what I see, many Abathur players with anything-but-locust builds tends to stay in base and don't move around the map.  It's crucial that you soak XP all game long. Especially in maps like Sky Temple, Cursed Hollow or Haunted Mines where objectives means that there is usually a lane empty somewhere. You can even soak both lanes in Mines while people are fighting for skulls.   Though, even if Abathur is my main hero, Dragon map and Spider tomb map are pretty hard for him, since he can't soak easily and can't cap the objective.

(keep in mind this really only applies to the top 1% of players)  And here's a video explaining map basics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUoZYYiNMRM  For learning the game, Lili, Raynor, ETC, and Valla are all pretty easy, and they only cost 2K gold each!  Since you have prior MOBA experience you can probably try out who you want though.  There are 7 heroes that are free to play each week, and they change every tuesday."
NexusNewbies,3dka4a,Ryguy_69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:15:29 2015 UTC,"The roles are kind of similar, specialist is the odd one out, I played LoL on and off since 2010 (damn it's been long) and have just picked up HotS for a month. First off, I LOVE IT! I love the horizontal map layout, I love the focus on team play/shared XP and I love the lack of shop and use of talents  I'll try to compare some heroes:   Zeratul - reminds me of Eve, he is invisible until you attack (they can see a ""shimmer"") and when he does attack its with high burst and strong AAs (later talents improve his AAs, faster or more damage) ETC - very similar to Alistar, he disrupts fights, can charge in, one ult is a small area stun, he's beefy, he head butts Diablo - kind of like Singed? Maybe because he has a move where you throw someone over your shoulder then stun them, he also has a charge which stuns, so he's basically, run in, fuck shit up, knock this guy out of the fight, throw this guy over here, lot's of fun and highest health hero I think, at least base health Raynor - he functions kind of like an ADC, he has a larger AA range than most, has a move that can knock people back, I play him kind of like an ADC but you need to make good use of your talents rather than AAing (that's a big thing in HotS if LoL is more spammy than DotA then HotS is the next progression, you can and should be using skills a lot, I'm only OOM when I'm spamming through everything in a long fight) Sonya - spin to win hero, but not tanky like Garen, her spin heals her considerably, she also has a hook which pulls you to a hero, but she is squishy depending how you build her so you might feel BA but you can die easily, also works off fury which builds up from AAs. Really really fun hero though (I bought her without playing her just from seeing others having fun and doing awesome) Muradin - kind of Garen Olaf mix I guess, he can throw a hammer to stun, he regenrates health out of the battlefield, one ult makes him a big unstoppable dude and he's one of the strongest tanks, jump in knock people around, does a good bit of damage especially with his AA enhancing skill but mostly a tank initiator Lili - seems to be the most straightforward healer, one ult is just a big circle of healing like Janna except she can run around while using it, her q is a heal, her w adds a lulu kind of sprite, its a dragon though, and it attacks targets, and her e does a bit of damage and blinds. I haven't played everyone but i've found her to be the strongest healer, you wouldn't really solo lane with her Rehgar - he's reminds me of Udyr but he's a healer less than a fighter but his wolf form (replaces his mount) does a good bit of damage on first AA, he has a heal and a slowing totem and an ult that can empower your allies to fight or run (like a sivir ult) Stiches - kind of a mix between blitz and sion, he has a long range hook which isnt too hard to master IMO and he has a ground stomp kind of thing which deals dmg and can slow in front of you, his ult either eats an enemy and you can walk around with them or he farts out slime that does DOT like singed gas, also farts slime when taking damage   That's really all I can think of at work where I cant go on the HotS website. I'm leaving out all the specialists because they are each unique but fun in their own way  Ask me any more questions you want though, I am loving HotS so far (level 21) and cant see myself returning to LoL (not that I've been playing it much lately) but I know a bunch about LoL and can help you understand HotS better.  The maps are of course totally different and the secondary objectives are hugely important, more so than Baron or Drake IMO. Maybe similar to drake since there are always fights over the secondary objectives but I feel they are stronger than a drake win."
NexusNewbies,3dka4a,eaglessoar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"If you mean roles like top/mid/bot/jungle, then no, not really. With that said, you still have tanks, supports, damage dealers and what not.  I highly recommend Valla if you're an ADC main in league - she plays a lot like Vayne and plays the same damage dealing role.   I haven't played every HotS champion yet, but I can give you some suggestions based on the ones I have played.  ADC   Valla - see above Raynor - Immobile kite-and-run damage dealer. Very boring, but easy, to play. Tychus - Sustained DPS squishy with a minigun mechanic similar to Jinx's. Sgt. Hammer - I'm assuming as an ADC player you know how to position and when to get the hell out, traits that are vital to any Sgt. Hammer player. She has no direct analogues in league - her main strength is sieging up (becoming immobile to gain tons of range and splash damage) at the edge of a fight to deal massive damage. If you know how to pick your targets and position yourself, you can play Sgt. Hammer.    Support   Li Li - think of Soraka with the amount of heals she can put out. Very easy to learn.    Mid   Kael'thas - bursty mage very reminiscent of Brand (abilities) and Karma (Kael can choose to strengthen individual spells for increased damage/utility). Nova - think of what you'd get if Eve, LB and Caitlyn had a baby. You now have a bursty invisible sniper. Takes a few games to get used to.   Top   Diablo - Tanky brawler with an Alistar headbutt and Singed fling. Stitches -  Fat Blitzcrank that can eat people Tahm Kench-style.   Honestly if you have any significant experience in LoL (no matter what role), it should transfer very well into HotS."

NexusNewbies,3dhu19,roscoejosh42,3,Thu Jul 16 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's also a good cc, and Anub has still a good sustain with his W and his beetles. Also his Q can help you escape. So it's different from Valla's vault or Sylv's E."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,henrax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's very true"
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,roscoejosh42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"but in general, unless you can see the enemy team entirely (or close to anyway), you should not use E to initiate, right?"
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,m_takeshi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yes you can initiate with it, so you can bypass the tank and attack the squichies behind. If you have a good burst healer and your team follows well it often wrecks the opposite team. Of course only initiate with it if the odds in the fights are in your favor, if you are 2v1 but have no idea where everyone else is don't do that.  Honestly Anub has a LOT of sustain (with beetles that heal him and his W) so in many fights you will be able to initiate AND escape the fight with your E. And also, your Q is very good to disengage."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,henrax,2,Thu Jul 16 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Although Anub's alternative lvl 10 ult, web blast, is the less popular choice, it will severely hinder the enemy team in team fights if you web blast their dps heroes (i.e. Jaina or Kael). This is even more useful if you can cocoon them while they are in the middle channeling their ult. I've been on the receiving end of this several times in HL and each time it turned the tide of the game. Similarly, if your teammate is on the receiving end of this, you can attack the cocoon to let them out."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,arcanis_hots,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"I like to web their healer or tank if I can - we focus down the squishies while we can, and then when the healer or tank pops out, we can focus them without the squishies blowing up our faces."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,dangerdan27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"True, I think it also depends on who is causing your team the most trouble. If their dps or healer are sub-par, and their tank is being super aggressive and your team is having difficulty dealing with them, it would make more sense to cocoon them."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,arcanis_hots,2,Thu Jul 16 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"I love this ability. I feel like I singlehandedly change group fights by targeting a healer, dps, or even a tank who came too close."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,frumious88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. I find it far more versatile and game changing the the other ult.
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,N8CCRG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"If you are the only initiator in your team the other ult is game changing. Jump in the fight, pop it, cc everybody, shield, watch everyone else die.  But yes if you're not in the front line and play him more like a melee assassin then web blast is a solid pick."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,henrax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"I find I loose a huge amount of my survivability as a tank when I take Web Blast. I only go for it when there is a second tanks, which in HL doesn't seem to be too often"
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,jacatola,2,Thu Jul 16 18:45:13 2015 UTC,"Anub'arak is one of my favorite warriors. I find him really fun to play as. Personally, I still find him more of a bruiser than a tank but he fits the bill in a pinch. His survivability goes up as the game goes on, especially with the beetle talents. For general tips I've found helpful:   Your burrow can go through terrain. You can easily hop from lane to the top dragon shrine on that map. You can hop from midlane on garden terror and burrow under to the big shambler. On cursed hollow you can easily come out onto curses to interrupt people from unknown crevices. This knowledge pairs well if you absolutely know where the enemy is and you have the upper hand in the fight (your burrow is your only escape after all, but as long as you know you're going to be in the fight for at least 16 seconds, it's ok to use it aggressively at times). I've used this trick with maximum success before. It's super fun and super rewarding. Web blast, though I prefer the other ult, can sway a teamfight. If they only have one healer, you can web them and now the enemy team either doesn't have heals for a few seconds, or they waste dps trying to get their ally out of the cocoon early which means their damage isn't going towards your team. Either way, you win. You can also web tanks or key dps targets as well. This ability works best if you use it variably so the enemy team doesn't predict who you're taking out of the fight. It's hard to kite Aub'arak with his kit, especially since he can easily close the gap or ranged stun/poke. His important skills are linear and you have about a second's delay. Quickly moving to either side of it will give you no damage or stun. My biggest tip in laning against Anub'arak is to keep moving and try to make it frequently side to side or diagonal so you're harder to hit. He also lacks a lot of his sustain in the laning phase so that can also be used to your advantage. If you don't use linear skillshots, the beetles can't block them giving you yet another edge.   I can't think of anymore right now. If I think of more I'll reply though."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,dreamslave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"Anubarak is my main in hero league, though I've only just started it. So far I've picked up that his shield W has a really short cool down, so spam it any time any damage is coming your direction (which should be most of the time as a tank)- it also helps keep your beetle numbers up. Use the Q for poking, peeling enemies chasing your allies, chasing, and interrupting channels- don't just throw it out without purpose because it has a pretty long cool down and doesn't do much damage really. E should be used only very judiciously, because it is your primary escape tool, and should rarely be used for engages (though using it as a chase is also acceptable). Do remember you can pop up early by hitting E again! In regards to the ults, pop swarm before a battle begins and pop cocoon when an opponent who is hard to kill or can't otherwise be dealt with currently is isolated (cocoon is hard to use in general, I prefer the sustain from swarm). Look up guides, much more in depth and knowledgable than my own understanding, do your research! Practice getting timings down, like with all heroes. You can Q then immediately E to really surprise an opponent at a distance with consecutive stuns and damage, giving you a leg up in any kind of duel where you initiate, since the spikes will continue to travel after you start burrowing- though be sure it's a safe situation, since your E won't be available after!"
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,Xaliver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:48:25 2015 UTC,"Regarding W, I kind of run out of mana when doing that, so I generally only spam W when heavily pushing (or during team fights of course).  I do have a question: I'm never sure what to pick on 20. Is rewind worth it for him with such a small mana pool?"
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,m_takeshi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:31 2015 UTC,"As a rule when I'm solo tank I take hardened shield and when it's duo I pick up rewind (I rarely if ever pick up improved ults). Also, I rarely have mana problems personally- the shield during the laning phase shouldn't be constantly spammed, no- maybe I was unclear about that- but whenever the opponent hero is poking at you it's worth it to keep your lane sustain going. Combining that with relatively rare uses of Q and E, and I rarely suffer from mana problems."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,Xaliver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:07 2015 UTC,I find it hard to vary Anub's build. How do you guys adjust for your opponents or friendlies?
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,jacatola,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"If you're dual warrior, you can build him more dps-oriented with Assault Scarab, Burning Rage, Blood for Blood, and Rewind, whereas if you're solo warrior you can build him more tanky with Regeneration Master, Spell Shield, Imposing Presence, and Hardened Shield.  Those are the two main variations I use, though often I will take ""the bee"" at 20 for lulz (Hive Master).  You can also mix and match as the opponent team dictates."
NexusNewbies,3dhu19,angrmgmt00,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"Anub vs. Zagara = no creep!  Q the creep clusters all day for great justice.  Also, Regeneration Master, Leeching Scarabs, and Imposing Presence go a long way toward making him more tanky; a common concern with Anub is that while he's good at disruption, he's kind of squishy."

NexusNewbies,3dhole,BalouEUW,4,Thu Jul 16 10:34:06 2015 UTC,"Hi !  HL mmr is quite accurate. In QM people often try new heroes/builds, warm up, or just don't really give a shit so your mmr can be widely inaccurate. Of course you need to upload all your games and even then sometimes it can be inaccurate (if you queue with very good players, if you play late in the night...) but with a decent amount of games (more than 200 for example) it gives a pretty good picture.  Hotslogs gives you pretty good mmr brackets. I would say that 3.8k+ players are the best of the best (Grubby and Chu are at 4k, while almost only solo Q and taking all sorts of heroes and builds, Fan from C9 is at 4.5k). 3K+ players are very good, and average players are from 2k to 3k. Lower that that are bronze and silver players."

NexusNewbies,3dhole,JeepCrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"Though it is self-reported, that doesn't mean that you are only shown what you upload. If someone uploads a replay and you were in that game, it counts for you too.  So not quite as bad as if everyone had to upload their own, but you're right, it won't show every game unless you upload all of yours or happen to always play with someone who does upload."
NexusNewbies,3dhole,JeepCrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"I downloaded the uploader from hotslogs that uploads every replay automatically. That tool should make the site more reliable if you get to the 100-150 games played mark, right?"
NexusNewbies,3dhole,dreamslave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"The more matches that are uploaded, the more accurate hotslogs can be, but hotslogs still won't be 100% accurate since Blizz hasn't released the exact system (as far as I know). So yeah, if you have played 100 matches but only 10 are uploaded, your MMR according to Blizz will probably be WAY off compared to your MMR on hotslogs.      Note: You need to have the uploader open while you play for it to automatically upload during your session.  Otherwise it will upload all the matches, that haven't been uploaded since the last upload, the next time you open it.  So either way, it's going to upload your stuff automatically, but WHEN it does may be different. Therefor if you are expecting changes or match info and you didn't have it open while you were playing, that info won't be there."
NexusNewbies,3dhole,dreamslave,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"It depends. If you save all your replays and upload them accordingly, they can be very accurate. However, if you don't, then it might not be. I don't upload anything to hotslogs and my account frequently dramatically changes in mmr and stats just based on a single upload (I also don't qm too frequently either so there's this). For someone who plays a lot of games per day this is probably different because the odds of the data being uploaded is higher than someone who hops in here or there and sometimes only goes into ai for daily quests for the day on busy days.   It seems like a lot of people are either in the ""always trust hotslogs always it is word of god"" camp or the ""hotslogs is garbage you can skew the numbers on purpose by selective uploading"" but I'm somewhere in the middle where it's a useful tool but people often misuse it to fluff up their posts or insult people they were grouped with without taking into account it may not have all the data. With great power comes great responsibility, I suppose. :P  I would say the hero winrate/census data is more accurate overall than the individual mmr on the site. Blizzard has said that's even skewed but their last nerf and buff patch was pretty on point with the winrates of heroes on hotslogs, with a few exceptions. So if you use it for this and not mmr you may find it more successful."
NexusNewbies,3dhole,Psysaturn,2,Thu Jul 16 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, the last part you mentioned is really really great about hotslogs. Since I've played only Jaina for the 50 first games I had no clue which other heroes are quite strong or even how to skill them.

NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,Boobtape,5,Wed Jul 15 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"No a bad idea. Here are my abathur tips:  1) play him vs AI a little first. He is a very strong hero, but difficult to play correctly. Watch some videos of him and practice with him before going into qm or HL with him.  2) in hl, please do not pick him first. By doing that you are forcing your team to build around you and allowing the enemy team to build counters to him. He should be picked towards the middle or end to build on an existing comp.  3) improve your map awareness. Make sure you hat/unhat during the correct times. This includes towers and keeps. If you are on one hero but see another in the middle of a fight that could benefit more from the hat, switch out to best suit the needs of that fight.   There are my very basic tips."
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,topher78714,5,Wed Jul 15 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"Abathur is my favorite hero to play and is my main hero. I don't play HL because of it :P But beware for a giant wall of text.  This is the build that I use because i loath locust builds and find that they are just subpar. I feel as though I almost always do more with this build. http://www.heroesfire.com/hots/talent-calculator/abathur#hYEy  BUT! Tips tricks etc etc.  Early game: Start off in the middle lane, I don't know why most abathurs seems to go top or bottom lane but seriously. Go to the middle lane. The locust at this early stage doesn't do much since heroes will be killing minions and if you go here to the middle lane you can cover almost the entirety of the map with your mines. Setting them up in most of the bushes near lanes and on routes between lanes to help your team be aware of a roaming enemy. It also pisses nova/zeratuls off a lot :D  The early game you should also be bouncing around with your symbiote the most. Unless the hero you're on is actually fighting an enemy hero don't be on them and constantly look at the minimap. If you see 2 hero icons go towards each other then jump there and hop on your ally as they are most likely fighting. But as soon as the 2 stop fighting then quickly hit R and look at the minimap again while laying down more mines. This way you have presence all over the map.  If you have the team die on a certain lane then you can burrow there and soak the lane until they return before you return to the middle.   around lvl 5/6 is when novas and zeratuls will start hunting you because they have enough health to escape turrets so be wary of that. Make sure you are positioned in a spot where if possible 4 turrets cover you and at least 3. If you do only have 3 try to make it a spot where if they attack you they can't escape easily. Like on the middle lane of the curse map if you're the right spawn. You can only have 3 turrets. If you're below the fort then nova can shoot you from the path and easily escape but if you're up towards the fountain and above the fort (Up and to the left) nova will HAVE to get attacked by the fort to actually kill you. Her escape route is longer. Keep this in mind!  Early objectives: This is when you're going to start moving around the map. Your goal is to go where they arnt and you HAVE to watch the minimap nonstop now. If you see the enemy team going north then burrow south, if they go south then go north. Use a few mines in bushes on the opposite side of the lane to give you early vision to leave the symbiote and escape. But you soaking here is really important. Make sure you're near the fighting minions before  helping the team.   Mid game: At level 10 however the game changes for you as the monstrosity comes out. This ult at 30 food deals massive damage per whack has as much HP as a tank and can take down many heroes in a 1v1. It also takes half damage from minions/towers. DO NOT LET THIS DIE. This is your 2nd priority is defending this thing. So let it loose on a heavily pushed lane towards your base. The closer to your base the better as it means the less you have to babysit it and the more you can help your teammates.   Random tip: THE CORE HEALS THE MONSTROSITY. If it has 100 hp, don't be afraid to waddle it back to the main base to heal up before letting it push back out on its own while helping teammates. (Hint, it will almost always go top lane automatically from the nexus thing so make sure you send it down the lane you want)  Feeding the monstrosity tips. It likes to move to the front due to it being melee but whenever it reaches a new wave symbiote it and move it back behind the minions and let them take the damage. This means you don't have to heal it as much later. Turrets, gates, WALLS, forts and every camp counts as a kill for the monstrosity. So feel free to use it to kill everything. Watch the minimap and realize that the closer it gets to an enemy fort/keep the more likely the enemy team is going to pounce on it so be sure to pull it back and move it to another lane that needs to be pushed towards them. Only if there is nothing going on the map. Like if there is a temple or a tribute or the mines that you can see their entire team is there then let it push. With minions it will tear apart everything by itself but make sure to pull it back occasionally so the keeps are not attacking it. But when the monstrosity hits about 25 you can pull it out of the lane and start wandering around with your teammates to help in all the teamfights. Which is where it should be, once it is fed it doesn't need to push lanes anymore so use it to help your team.  The level 13 and 16 talents are what gives the monstrosity sustain and the ability to slow their team so the big slow monster can catch up to them as well as helping the entire team catch up. with Soma transference you can generally heal for 10% of its life if you hit all of the enemies. Recognize this thing is a bruiser type hero in team fights and gives your team a 5th body (Although is often ignored by enemies for several reasons). At lvl 20 it hits 400 damage a hit (About as much as sgt hammer) and with the lvl 4 talent it hits faster than hammer.  At lvl 20 is when the monstrosity really shows its strengths. With the lvl 20 talent for it it can now burrow. This means you have the best 'hero' z in the game. You can burrow back to the nexus to heal up then let it push out as your symbiote is on other heroes, burrow to key locations to kill their abathurs or my personal favorite. A team fight starts to happen or a skirmish? Burrow straight to their squishies like Kael/jaina or their healer. A sudden full fed monstrosity with a hat on top it wrecks them and takes them out of the battle because they will quickly start to flee or die.   Notes about the lvl 20 talent: You have to go off of your monstrosity and back onto it to give it burrow and to start counting stacks towards it. It also lets you keep half of the stacks AFTER you get onto it. so if you hop back on it and it is already 30 and it dies right then you will start at 0. But it will count stacks after that, if you kill 30 more things before it dies it will come back as 15.   Late game: This is the same as the mid game but you're just that much stronger. Due to the 0 talents in the locusts I have no qualms about going back to the nexus and sitting there so no nova/zeratul or diablo ult will get me (diablo ult stuns you and forces you out of the symbiote, be aware of that :D). You arnt made for pushing in this build. However, it is nice to still be as far forward as safety allows as it means you can continue to lay mines around the map when needed. Just use your monstrosity, help the team, and watch the minimap. You are also the best anti abathur locust build due to the ability to lay a mine and quickly burrow the monstrosity there and kill him before cleaning up.   Alternative builds and considerations.   Illidan. Illidan can end up ruling the game and changing a lot more with this build than your monstrosity would. With your 13 talent healing him and the attack speed buff a good illidan will never die and he does become a priority. Feel free to choose him over the monstrosity but it is situational :D  Hivemind: Almost everyone picks hivemind and I admit it is AMAZING when it works. But it has no synergy at all with other talents or ults and half the time your teammates wont stay together to keep both hats on. If you try this with your monstrosity then you have to leave your monstrosity as it herp derps forward for 3 seconds. Most likely leaving the range of allies before you can grab it again so it becomes more frustrating. I found that if you're going monstrosity and focusing on it then don't go hivemind as it is inconsistent. The only time I take this is when I go Ultimate Evolution.  Ultimate evolution: There are 2 reasons I will get this ult but I don't really enjoy it. The first one is if i'm playing the new map the demon/angle one because lanes don't really get pushed and it is incredibly hard to feed the monstrosity as all heroes are near it and it doesn't take long for them to pop up and kill a fresh monstrosity before it can feed. The 2nd one is if i'm going to focus with an illidan and not a monstrosity. This allows for the hivemind lvl 20 talent. However I don't like this ult because it doesn't have any synergy with the rest of the talents. I am building a hat and nothing but a hat in talents. It is my strength and in a teamfight my hat does a lot of work. But this ult means no more hat to support/buff my teammates and now i'm limited to a hero that I chose. I also might do this on the spider queen map. It is tiny and the monstrosity can struggle to get up there. But I still prefer the monstrosity.  Locust builds: I've only ever lost a game where I felt the locust build did shit was once and that was because I couldn't get my monstrosity up (it was early and I was still learning how to get it up) and my team refused to do anything about it. letting him tear us apart despite  the ease it takes to clean it up and kill abby. (we even had a nova t-t). Occasionally I will lose to abathurs doing locust builds but for the most part I find they don't do much. they will generally deal more siege damage than me, but their hero damage is pitiful. I've kept up with kael thas and all the extremely high damage heroes with good monstrosity control in hero damage and the siege damage will still generally be up in the 100k due to the monstrosity pushing lanes as it feeds.   Conclusion:  I hope that this build works for you, i've never seen any other abathur do this build and it really saddens me because i have 60%+ winrate with this build. Just remember all the different parts of this build. I like to think that abathur is the mind, the symbiote is the head and the monstrosity is the body and they all work together to really make a scary force.  Thanks for reading :P"
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,UltiBahamut,2,Wed Jul 15 19:41:55 2015 UTC,As a fellow abby lover I have to ask whether you think it's actually worth spending the time to send your monstrosity all the way back to base?   Since the monstrosity will go back to lane as soon as the hat is off you have to hat the thing the whole time. Which is time that could be spent doing other things.
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,jus_plain_me,2,Wed Jul 15 19:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. If nothing is going on then by all means, waddle that slow thing back to base. If there is a team fight going on then let it go and help the team. It is why I say feeding it/keeping it alive is your 2nd priority. Helping the team is the first always. But if you can do both then do both. I would say at least try to move it to a safer lane so it can heal by killing minions because it is a pain to work it back up. But it is completely situational.  *I meant to say this in the main post but forgot to put it in. Dang my last edit sent it over 10000 xD"
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,UltiBahamut,3,Wed Jul 15 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"I picked up Abathur on a whim and have since had a very high win-rate (my second highest, somehow) with him.   1) I almost always go for: Pressurized Glands, Adrenal Overload, Needlespine, Evolve Monstrosity, Soma Transference, (Adrenaline Boost or Envenomed Spikes), and Hivemind.   2) The point of this build is to focus on hatting your allied heroes and doing huge damage to enemy heroes. Hivemind is the most important talent because it literally doubles your damage output. Don't skip hivemind. Don't do it.  3) Split pushing is secondary to helping your allies. I only split push if there's literally no one I could help by hatting (e.g. all healing, or enemies all dead, etc). If you're hatting lane minions while your allies are in a team fight, you're the reason the team is losing.   4) Similarly, try to drop your monstrosity in an empty lane while the enemy team is distracted. If you drop it in front of an enemy hero, it'll just die, so you want to put it somewhere where it can farm and push for a while. I don't like spending time hatting the monstrosity, because  Abathurs get tunnel vision and don't help their allies when they do that, so only hat it when your team is not near enemies.   5) In my opinion, mines are the most commonly misused/underused piece of Abathur's kit. You should have constant vision of boss, turn-ins, etc. Practice unhatting (obviously, at a good time), quickly placing mines in key positions, and rehatting. Don't forget about mines, they can change the game.   6) Focus on symbioting high-damage auto-attackers, especially melee, such as Illidan, Thrall, The Butcher. You will increase their attack speed and they will get you closer to targets that you can spike."

If the 2nd target went out of range dropping the symbiote and another hero moved into range, would the symbiote move target? Or would I need to exit out and reapply symbiote again to get another double symbiote?"
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,JeepCrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm NA but I see a fair amount of EU posters and I'm sure there are more that don't mention it each post so you're not alone! :)      No, an ally walking within range after a teammate loses their hat does NOT get one cast on them automatically.  You have to un-cast, wait for cooldown, then cast it again to get 2 ally players covered.  This is why you should be sure to mention that you will be getting Hivemind at the beginning of the game to give them a heads up.  Mention it again when you actually get the ability and keep reminding them after if they aren't staying close together (just be sure not to over-do it and annoy them).   Important Note: The player you initially cast on will not lose his/her hat. Just like normal, they will have it the entire time you stay there. Only the ""bonus hat"" will go away when they are out of range.      Side note: Great job getting these discussions going /u/Boobtape.

If I hat her, she doesn't decloak right? I know it would give away she is there if I try and stab anyone but that's another issue.  I'm glad the threads are helping people! I want more people to be able to ask whatever they need to ask and play :)"
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,isothermicexpansion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't know the answer to this and had been curious so I searched around. I had a Nova yell at me too and honestly it seemed like it might have broken stealth, but perhaps I used an ability and someone pulled her out because of it, I'm not sure.  Only source that seems to be pretty clear is a thread from the official NA forums from May Link.      What I gather is that no, casting it on them does not break stealth. It sounds like using your abilities (stab and spikes) do not break it either, meaning they will still be stealthed yet your attacks can hit people. This would obviously help enemies track down your teammate and bring them out of stealth, but its interesting that their stealth doesn't break."
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,isothermicexpansion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:34 2015 UTC,I didn't think it did break it though. When I gave my hat to a Zeratul in stealth he was still cloaked till he attacked. However I know why Nova players whine. If you hat Nova the real one shows the hat and the decoys become meaningless.
NexusNewbies,3ddy2i,JeepCrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"That too. I as accused of bringing her out of stealth but I don't think I did.  Either way, I am usually wary of hatting stealth players unless they are running away or in the middle of a fight and not hidden."

NexusNewbies,3de79l,syanz,8,Wed Jul 15 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"I've played quite a bit of Dota 2 as well and some hours of HotS so I think I can give you some general rules (exceptions apply of course depending on the game). So here goes (wall of text incoming):  First of all the map objective is usually the most important thing you should go to and help when you're new. Some are less powerful than others and others get stronger as the game goes on but just for starting out they should pretty much always be your top priority.  Getting the Exp from dying lane minions is immensely important. If your team doesn't need help with an objective or it isn't up and you see a free lane that no one is ""soaking"", as the playerbase calls it, then you should likely go there and help your team level up.  You probably are already aware of this but there are no items and no shops. What varies each game is what talents you pick as your team levels up. Also you already start out with three full abilities that you can use from level 1 that you don't have to put skills points into first and you gain your Ultimate at level 10, not 6.  Kills in the early game also are not as important as they are in Dota. Of course whenever you can you should go for them as it denies experience to the enemy team for a bit but death timers are short and since there is no gold loss from dying there is no spiral of losing the lane and dying over and over as it sometimes happens in Dota. Hero kills matter a lot more shortly before objectives spawn and after level 10 when they award more Exp and death timers reach more meaningful lengths. Chasing for a kill for a long time when you could be doing something better is also a mistake I see a lot of people make.  There really isn't a jungle like in Dota either. There are neutral minions around most maps but their purpose is not to give you gold or experience but rather to help you push or actually more crucially to force your opponent in a bad situations where they have to decide between going to an objective or defending their towers from the neutral minion push elsewhere on the map. So try to be mindful of how you make use of the neutrals.  Another thing is that in Dota you sometimes will see a draft that is almost exclusively focused around pushing down towers and overwhelming the enemy early with gold and Exp advantage. In HotS you could draft a team like this but they normally should not be able to contest the objectives that well which will also push hard against them so that strategy usually doesn't work out all that well in almost all games (unless you are on Haunted Mines).  Lastly we come to maybe the most important and deceptively simple piece of advice I can give. Don't die. You might get stuck in a shitty lane against two people and you have no good wave clear on your hero and your team might not be responding to you when you ask for assistance. It happens. Just try to stay safe and in soaking range of the dying minions and help out your team when the time comes.  That's everything I can think of at the moment. If someone wants to correct something I said then please do since I honestly haven't played that much of the game myself yet. Anyway I hope you will enjoy the game and have fun."
NexusNewbies,3de79l,Hands_of_Fate,3,Wed Jul 15 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"In regards to which heroes to start out on:  there are 6 heroes that cost only 2k gold each (Lili, ETC, Valla, Muridan, Malfurion, and Raynor) that come up on the free rotation 2 at a time and cycle around every 3 weeks. They were chosen for this position because they tend to be pretty straightforward to learn and use. So I would suggest you start there to get a feel for the overall game meta. This week's two are Lili and ETC. Lili is a support (stand near your teammates and hold Q to toss healing potions on them) while ETC is a warrior with a dash and good crowd control abilities. Lili would be the one I would recommend to start with as she gives a great chance to observe and see how the meta plays out - just follow your teammates around and keep them healed while they push the lanes and map objectives at the right times."

She's a good pick right now, has a couple different builds that work, has an escape, and is fairly straightforward to learn. She's my 2nd favorite champion and the one I have at a highest level, I would definitely recommend her to a new player!"
NexusNewbies,3de79l,cloral,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"Another thing to add: HotS has a fairly robust bot system. So starting out, it's a good idea to play some 'Vs AI' games until you feel comfortable. You'll have human teammates, but the opponents will all be bots. These bots are good for learning general map strategies but generally aren't as good at teamfighting as human opponents are, so it's a sort of 'easy mode'. In addition, it's likely that many of your teammates will be trying out new heroes, so there isn't much pressure to play your hero to its fullest potential."
NexusNewbies,3de79l,Eriennyl,2,Wed Jul 15 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"Well /u/Hands_of_Fate covered almost everything. But just wanna emphasize abit more on objectives and exp.  If ur team is underleveled or down a talent level, talent levels 1/4/7/10/13/16/20 btw, then its more advisable to soak exp first. The team that usually gets to 10 first will win in team fights most of the time if the other team isn't 10.   I wouldn't go into detail but u'll prolly meet ppl telling u this in game when to soak or contest for objectives. In HoTs having level advantage is huge as its 5 players having a level advantage, even more so if its a talent advantage.   And u have to buy TP scrolls in Dota 2, not in HoTs. If ur well is on cd and u're low. Just hearth back to heal. Hearthing back instantly gives u 500hp and not sure how much mana, its better than walking back. Make it a habit to ping someone to soak ur lane while u hearth back though, just type ""brb oom"".  On heroes to learn on, well I think u have to try all the ones on rotation. You start with 5(i tink) then u get another rotation unlock at lvl 12/15. Leveling them to level 5 is fast and u get 500g. There's also a friend bonus when u party u get +50% exp.  Perhaps after playing some heroes come back and tell us who u like or ask us more questions! We could advice u more before u splurge all ur gold on a hero u don't enjoy ;)"

While his healing numbers aren't that great, taking the talents Leeching Plasma and Khala's Embrace can return a buttload of health if your teammates autoattack safely and I've healed up someone like a Tychus or Valla pretty darn fast with one shield. At the same time, I wouldn't recommend him as an only support on the team unless the enemy team only had Tyrande, especially against burst healers."
NexusNewbies,3dde7m,dreamslave,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:37 2015 UTC,Haven't heard of any big detail/result that would make tassador a viable solo-support. I feel like the teammates who flamed you underestimated tassador's damage and overestimated his healing/shielding role thinking he was sufficient alone.
NexusNewbies,3dde7m,silverhydra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:00 2015 UTC,"Your teammates were being a bit silly. Tassadar is a spectacular character, but not one that can solo support well. Tassadar is great against stealthed heroes or maps with low vision chokepoints, countering specialists or siegy maps, and being in general a jack of all trades. I usually personally don't build him for damage until his lategame slow talents and that's more to help my allies secure kills, I still wouldn't take my build into HL alone as the solo support.   Around where you are in HL, a lot of people think they know it all and sometimes give bad advice or flame about picks wrongfully. I'd try to ignore them and trust yourself. It seems like you know enough to know when they're being foolish and you need to do what's right not what your team wants."
NexusNewbies,3dde7m,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Tassadar is so strong at complimenting the team in many intangible ways, but healing is not one of them.  He can provide a proactive buffer but his main job isn't as a healer.  His strengths lay in his vision and his utility versatility.  MULE, Shielding structures, space control (storm, force wall), etc... very powerful on certain maps.  Not only that, but Tass can really lay out some very impressive siege damage numbers while being very hard to kill.  Getting flamed for taking him as a 2nd support is not your fault, but rather most likely ignorance from the other player(s)."

It's also worth noting that Tyrande and Tassadar shouldn't be solo support.   I'll also say though that you can really rock oddball picks too if you understand the hero and where it fits in things popular for the meta or not. Both Sonya and Gazlowe have a bad rep, but they've been shocker picks in tourneys recently with surprisingly favorable results. So I recommend not counting out heroes and trying them all.

As they develop and grow, your MMR will rise and develop and grow with them.  Your Hero League MMR is completely separate from your QM MMR. You should not worry about your QM MMR if you're going to be at all concerned about MMR in the first place.   All MMR is trying to do is fit you in a balanced game..So if you're being ""Weighed Down"" by queuing with lower MMR friends, your MMR will also fall.

That way things won't get too crazy.

She has a pretty high top build win rate average as well showing that used skillfully she can make an impact on her teams' successes. She is middle of the road when it comes to the pro-scene, but still could be a decent pick if needed.

NexusNewbies,3dbnt8,hacdladf1,3,Wed Jul 15 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways to stop him, some mentioned below:   Run behind your gate, it breaks the charge and if he doesn't stop it he will take tower shots while his character stutters for a few seconds. Using an ability that grants unstoppable or untargetable stuff at the right timing can help with this too. Muradin's dwarf toss or Johanna's falling sword are examples of this. I also have a theory this is why they took unstoppable off Illidan's dive, Falstad's barrel roll and a lot of other abilities when the Butcher dropped. I haven't tested this but I've seen people use bolt of the storm right before pyroblast and other things connect to negate them completely. Similar to the one above, this would require a very great reaction time. The simplest one but probably the one that requires a bit of coordination is to dps him down before he reaches his target. He's unstoppable but he can still take damage and die.   Even if you can't dodge it, you can make him pay for it. Running behind your teammates can cause him to overextend and get blown up. If he furnace ults with it, get away from your team and after it connects use your escapes (vault, barrel roll, what have you) to get away safely.

Regardless, it's Blizzard's game and whatever changes they want to make for whatever reason it's their choice.  Agreed for sure on the escapes, though. The good Butchers are just as difficult to deal with as the good Illidan's. They really make you save your escapes and know your character's ins and outs well.

Been maining him as support since Blizz killed Brightwing. He has good burst heal, a good stun for locking down enemy squishies, and 2 viable ults depending on the game.  He is the tankiest support and even when he dies you can still heal your team for a bit.  Uther can be a bit harder to play if you get his actives like cleanse and shrink ray but he is very rewarding :)  Rehgar is the most mobile of supports and can be built to do some decent damage with his shield and attacks.  His chain heal is really strong and ancestral healing (his ult which basically fully heals a hero) can win team fights when used correctly.  Go into wolf form (Z) on cooldown since his 1st basic attack after using Z does extra damage. His only downside is no CC other than his slowing totem but Rehgar is in a good place right now.  IMO, tyrande and tassadar are more niche picks and you need another support in the team for them to be successful, so I would hold off on them unless you really want one. Brightwing is too expensive in her current state. And you should be fine with those two, but i would look at getting rehgar or uther for HL.  Hope this helped!"
NexusNewbies,3da4yb,Ryguy_69,2,Tue Jul 14 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Rehgar and Uther are the top tier supports right now. If you plan on playing support often you should have one, if not both of them.  I personally prefer Reghar over Uther, while both have game-changing ults, Rehgar's can be much more demoralizing to an enemy team when used properly."
NexusNewbies,3da4yb,iceberglived,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:40:53 2015 UTC,Malf is top tier support too without a doubt.
NexusNewbies,3da4yb,henrax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"should probably have both rehgar and uther, these 4 heroes are the only good healers atm, so you will be fine."
NexusNewbies,3da4yb,monkJ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"You should.   While Malf is in a good place right now he lacks the burst heal when healing vs a burst comp like KT/Jaina/Zeratul comps. Uther/Rehgar have the burst heals and very good ults for backup.  Uther is better from level 1, since u pretty much take regen/cleanse/shrink etc without the need for talents boosting heals unlike Rehgar where he shines after level 10 but he's a beast(pun lol) mode healer once u hit 13/16."
NexusNewbies,3da4yb,Eriennyl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:51:17 2015 UTC,rehgar and uther are sex machines
NexusNewbies,3da4yb,fanboyhunter,0,Wed Jul 15 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"I would suggest Tyrande or Tass before those two, unless you enjoy playing them of course.  This also depends on your level, what you enjoy playing and how much gold you have."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,RogueT3ch,9,Tue Jul 14 04:40:04 2015 UTC,"The Lost Vikings aren't a one size fits all type of hero, and Murky, though listed as ""Specialist"", is more of an assassin. I'd mention Zagara as the 2nd hero on that list.  Tyrael is good, but it should be noted he's not a main tank, but a bruiser, and Muradin or Arthas would be the 3rd pick there."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,tundranocaps,4,Tue Jul 14 07:43:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. Just taking the best heroes (by winrate) from hotslogs could be a bit misleading, especially for new players. We should also take into account hero popularity as well.  Murky, and The Lost Vikings are very unpopular heroes (they are very rarely played) and the people playing them have generally come to them knowing how they should be played. This applies to a lesser extent with Tyreal as he often gets taken only in double warrior teams. The Butcher is new, expensive and also has been mostly picked by people interested in his style of play specifically.  Now this isn't to say these heroes are bad and shouldn't be played. But if I had to recommend heroes to newer players to get first, I would have Sylvanas, Valla and Muradin on the list above the others.  As it stands now I would say that any hero with a popularity of less than ~30% isn't going to be great for the majority of players. But after you've got a solid lineup of characters feel free to look into the more niche picks."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,Shifty_Paradigm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"This isn't a personal preference list. This information was pulled from hotslogs. I agree that Vikings might not be for everyone, but in higher competitive play, you'll want to be able to pilot them efficiently as they are very good in certain maps."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,Psionatix,3,Tue Jul 14 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"People should definitely be uploading their replays to hotslogs. When you upload your replay, statistics of ALL the people who were in that match are provided and used by the site. It's definitely beneficial to see how you're going.  When I started out, I played a few Player vs AI matches to get the hang of things before QM. Once I started QM, I played nothing but Valla for over 100 games. The whole time, I knew I needed to branch off and play other heroes but had no idea who to try out.  I gave Malf a try, and as a support, I actually find him more fun than Valla now.  If you view my hotslogs profile you can see I'm almost above a 50% win rate with both of them. My first QM with Malf went really well. We dominated the enemy team and I ended up having over 100k heal, and I had literally only played one AI game with him before that.   After that one QM, I had 5~7 losses in a row, however I myself did do pretty well with every game. Minimal deaths (~2), decent heal amount and good poke / tease, etc.   My trouble is, now I've gotten the hang of Valla and Malf, I really need a specialist and warrior type hero that I can play. Once I have at least 1 of each that I'm alright with, then I'll try to branch off into others. I find it can be difficult at times, especially when certain heroes require certain expectations of your team that just aren't being delivered, which in turn influences your mood/attitude and feeling regarding a particular hero.  Can anyone recommend a specialist and warrior hero for me to try out based on my liking of Malf and Valla?"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,Psionatix,3,Tue Jul 14 05:10:49 2015 UTC,"I always recommend Sylvanas if you like to stay ranged. For warrior, nothing beats Johanna. She's a beast."

NexusNewbies,3d7tev,tundranocaps,2,Tue Jul 14 06:33:43 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I main warriors, and when forced to learn a support and assassin, I gravitated towards Valla and Malfurion as well.    Here's a quick breakdown of my personal favorite warriors:    ETC - one of my favorite warriors to play, but not the most popular pick these days in the meta. Some of the best peel in the game and good CC. Mosh Pit is a bit gimmicky, but is SO rewarding when you land a good one. Muradin - used to be my favorite warrior as he is super tanky, has a good escape, solid CC, is great against AA-based heroes like Zeratul/Raynor/Valla/Illidan. Can be spec'ed to do insane damage, especially if he is the second warrior in a dual-warrior comp. However, I think he's hard countered by Anub (and his damn beetles) as they can block his hammer CC and can also negate the 300% damage Thunderclap talent. Tyrael - my absolute favorite right now, and is easily my most winningest hero (I think I have a 70% win rate with him right now in HL). I've heard people say he can't be the main tank on your team, but I vehemently disagree - I can absolutely have success playing as an off-tank and specc'ing damage, but he can also be built to be insanely tanky (Regen Master+Amplified Healing+Angelic Absorption/Imposing Will), and the Regen Master/Amplified Healing combo works wonders with Supports that provide gradual healing, like Lili or Malf. His Judgment heroic is my favorite heroic in the game. My one warning is that he absolutely drains mana - but once I learned to use primarily Smite (your E) as your damage dealer, and save El'Druin's Might (your Q) only for when you really need it, my winrate skyrocketed.    Good luck!"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,genghiskim,2,Tue Jul 14 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"Tyrael isn't a main tank not because he's not tanky enough, but because he doesn't bring the necessary CC to peel/initiate, outside of his ultimate. Johanna, E.T.C., Muradin, and Anub'Arak all have CC on a consistent basis.  Tyrael is a bruiser, he switches CC for the ability to murder opposing heroes. You can build Tyrael tankier, but you can't make him into a main-tank, in form of consistent hard CC."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,genghiskim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:41:55 2015 UTC,"This might just be semantics then (if your definition of ""main-tank"" means hard CC)! But if you're arguing that Tyrael can't be the only tank/warrior on your team, then I would disagree - I'd say 90% of my Tyrael HL wins are as playing him as the only warrior.    You're right - he does not have hard CC as a regular Q/W/E skill, and that is arguably his biggest weakness. However, he does get more damage than the traditional warrior (which you mentioned), and a TON of utility. If your team is retreating, then you can use your Smite to help your team move a little faster, and nailing a good Q can be instrumental in helping body block (especially when coupled with your W to shield your teammates). Definitely not peel in the traditional sense, but you do have SOME ways to help peel opponents away.    In addition, you do get CC at level 10 with Judgment (for what it's worth), which I think is the best initiate in the game (and can stop other heroics like Lili's Jugs or Nova's Triple Tap). He deals enough damage that he can't just be ignored, but can be specc'ed to soak tons of damage/have tons of health (especially with Regen Master+Amp Healing). Just my 2 cents on my favorite hero!    PS Does Johanna really have CC before she gets her Shield heroic? I know her W does a tiny bit of CC, but I wouldn't put her in the same class as ETC/Mura/Anub when it comes to CC, in my humble opinion."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,tundranocaps,2,Tue Jul 14 14:39:43 2015 UTC,CC usually refers to any ability that hinders the movement of enemy heroes. Johanna's Q ability slows enemies hit and her W pulls enemies around.
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, thanks! In that case, i suppose Tyrael's Q allows slow and thus should count as CC as well, right?"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,genghiskim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"Only if you talent for it, but then yes, though it's still not hard CC, which refers to silences/polymorphs/stuns, that stop you from acting."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,Psionatix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Johanna can keep you from doing what you want, slow, blind, and the mini-stun displacement. Even if Condemn's stun is tiny, it still disrupts channeled abilities, which is a consideration, and every single ability on her kit has some form of CC.  Also, you can run comps with zero warriors. Tyrael isn't a tank in your comp, or at least, he's a tank in the form that Chen is, ""damage soak"", it's just not what people mean. Your job isn't really ""tanking"". You can say it's semantics, but that's exactly what you get when you discuss, well, labels.  Also, by your logic, we can consider Zeratul a tank for the same reasons as Tyrael, about ultimate-initiate and damage that can't be ignored ;)  I'm not saying Tyrael is bad, I'm saying he's not a tank, and that when you look for a tank, he's not a good fit."
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,genghiskim,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but can't disagree more! Sure, the prevailing wisdom is to run him as an off-tank alongside someone like Anub, but even Hotslogs shows tons of winning comps where he is the solo warrior/tank, and I've certainly watched enough VODs where he plays that role.    I guess it brings up an interesting discussion point - what is the job of a tank? I would argue that it is these 3 things:    1) Be in front of the team to soak damage and body block skill shots or heroes from getting to your back line during teamfights. 2) Help initiate team fights. 3) Help peel for your team when we need to disengage.   Tyrael accomplishes #1 with his health regen and shields (depending on his spec); he has arguably the best initiate in the game to help accomplish #2; and although his peel is not great, he makes up for it with his mobility with both his Q and E.   I personally think he's versatile and can easily be your main tank or a bruiser, and I think he fits best in two scenarios: where he is the only tank in part of a double support team (the sustain is insane when coupled with Regen Master+Amp Healing) or when he's going up against multiple squishies (pick any 2 of Valla/Kael/Jaina/Zeratul/Zagara/Nova).    Like with any hero in the game, your team's comp and your opponent's comp obviously matters a lot, but I absolutely believe he can be a great tank. Just my 2 cents!"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,gmorf33,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Highly appreciate the recommendations.  Thus far, just from playing with and against ETC and Tyrael, I'm not entirely fond of either of them.  However I think of the two, I would favor Tyrael as he is usually the one I find more difficult to play against.  I'll just have to get over my non-fondness and try him out and base my opinion on actually using him rather than everything else!"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,ckax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:20:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely - just try 'em when they hit the free rotation! I'm confident you'll like one of them.    Also, try Muradin - he's the first tank I played with that truly FELT like a tank. Tons of HP, good damage, and hard CC. I just personally think he doesn't do so well against Anub, who is quite popular in HL these days.    And maybe Anub would be to your liking? Feels almost like an assassin with how much CC and damage he can dish out. Just a warning - I prefer my tanks to be a bit beefy (that is, can take damage), and I believe Anub has the lowest HP of any warrior (lower than even Sonya), making him feel a bit too squishy for me. Just my 2 cents though!"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,Psionatix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:10:12 2015 UTC,I hate playing WITH ETC.  He tends to be the master of ruining skillshots and combos with his AoE knockback lol.  That's speaking strictly of solo q though.    I would definitely have Muradin on the list of top warriors to start HL with though.  He's one of the best and he's much easier to play (as in he won't completely mess up your own team with a bad KB/stun).  He also has a few variations to his main build that make him interesting and able to do other things.  Like you can go gang-buster mode and just roam with a ganker and combo your stun with their gank and have fun picking off strays.  Plus he's dirt cheap!  2000 gold or pick him up in the starter pack bundle for $4.99
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,gmorf33,2,Wed Jul 15 19:28:24 2015 UTC,"If you have a low gold total, I would heavily recommend Muradin for tank. He is currently considered one of the top tanks and is only $2k gold.  For specialist, sylvanas is great, and so is zagara, but they are more expensive.  I would recommend Gazlowe. Although he is not viewed as ""top tier"", he can still be very effective - and also very fun. Most importantly, he will give you a prototypical ""specialist"" to better understand the role.  It's all about pushing lanes and having your summons (In his case, turrets) tank minions or mercs, and basically do the work for you. $4k"
NexusNewbies,3d7tev,spyxy_kt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Will most definitely give Muradin a go.

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,mikexstudios,7,Mon Jul 13 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"/u/KuniumiHotS had a great short/concise response. Please be sure to upvote his/her post. I'll be using the points mentioned in that post as  a springboard and will expand upon them as well as add a little of my own. I am not a god-tier Abathur player but I have read lots of guides, played quite a few games with him, and think I understand him most out of the heroes I have played. Link to HotSLogs profile Prepare for a wall of text.  You've been warned...       It depends on who you are playing and when he puts a hat on you.       This. Abathur putting his Symbiote on you (which I will refer to as ""hatting"" or ""hat"") could be done for many reasons.  Perhaps you are about to start a team fight. Maybe he hats you so you can dive in with a shield to start the fight. Perhaps you are low on health and he is on you to give you a shield so you can get away.  Maybe you're low and being chased by someone low too and he thinks you could get away or turn around and 1-shot your pursuer and live with his shield. Lastly, perhaps he saw some enemies incoming that you might not have. In this case, hopefully, he should be pinging the map to warn you and he's on you to help you survive. There are MANY reasons he is on you ranging from just helping to clear minion waves to saving your butt.       If you are fighting, and believe you can beat someone in a fight, go all in.       This is situational but often true.  As stated above, there are many reasons for Abathur to hat (not hate) you but usually it's to help in a fight. If you have your cooldowns and are pretty certain you could take the enemy hero WITHOUT Abathur, by all means go in. He will give you a small shield, a little AoE (which upgraded slows enemies), and some poke power. If you are a melee hero, can chase safely, and the enemy hero only has 2 or 3 small hits left, keep chasing. Let Abathur's Stab finish them off.  If Abathur upgrades it, the range is actually pretty good and it's a 2s cooldown. Secure that kill.       If you are fairly low and need to survive, run away. Abathurs are there to help you out, and if you happen to walk away when you should have engaged, I think most will forgive you because they can easily un-hat you, and hat another person in about 3 seconds.       I'm sure there are several ""styles"" of Abathur players so I don't claim to speak for them all. I'll speak for myself. Usually, if you are below 50% hp, I'm not on you to help you kill anyone. I'm there to help you survive. I want to deny the other team a kill and perhaps get one for us.  If you are below 50% and most of your abilities are on cooldown, unless you have teammates that you can finish enemy heroes off with, I want you to run. Sometimes you have to stay and fight for an objective which may result in sacrificing yourself which is fine. I can help you survive a little and put out more damage to hopefully kill them before they kill you.  But I mostly use the shield as a ""GTFO of here"" ability.  The shield, while being very useful, is not very strong.  From my very un-scientific observations it seems to stop 2-3 auto attacks or 1 decent damage ability.  That can change a fight sometimes, but more often than not, it's not a huge game-changer.  If you are running and suddenly find yourself hatted, for the love of all things holy, PLEASE do not turn around and go back into the fray.  Keep running. I want you to live and my shield is not going to turn you into a tank.      Important note: We can cancel our hat.  We can remove it at any time and smart Abathur players will do so often.  Don't see the hat on you and assume it will be there for the next 20 seconds.  Here's why: We can actually shield you more often if we use it on you, leave you, and then come right back than if we just stayed on you.  At this point you may be like ""WTF?!"" but it's true.  Shield has a 12s cooldown.  Symbiote (hat) has a 4 second cooldown.  So.... If I hat you, shield you instantly, and within a few seconds the shield is gone, what should I do?  Sometimes I'll stay on and help poke/AoE them if I deem that's the best option.  But often, I will leave you.  4 seconds later, I'm back on you and you have another shield.  That's now 2 shields within ~6-8 seconds.  Instead of 12s.  Double shield!  This also works for spikes (the AoE) but that cooldown is only 6s so its not as big of a deal. Because of this, you will see the Symbiote bounce around often.  Don't EXPECT Abathur to stay on you or be around, but if you see him on you, for the next few seconds, consider your situation and prepare. Maybe dive in to finish off a hero, maybe run, maybe run up to a wave of minions real quick so Abathur can AoE them and help push them back.      It's hard playing QM solo with an Abathur or as an Abathur. He's best used when the team can clearly communicate quickly and the other heroes understand how to play with an Abathur. I'm glad you are asking how to play with one as opposed to just complaining about him.      Last note which is a PSA:  If you have an Abathur on your team, PLEASE do not give up at the beginning.  I don't know how many times I have seen ""Abathur AFK"" or ""looks like 4v5"" and the like, but it has been a TON.  Luckily, I have managed to change quite a few people's minds by the end of the game and they have found a new respect for the hero.  Abathur is not there to physically help you in a team fight. He's not there to push like crazy.  He's there to help the team overall.  What this means is he's there to help keep you equal in level to the enemy team and hopefully ahead of them. He's there to help you escape and deny the enemy team kills.  He's there to have lots of map awareness and warn you of incoming enemies, what lane could safely be pushed, how many enemies are missing or where they are.  He is all over the map pushing minions, helping in team fights, providing map awareness, etc.  Several times I have received the ""GTFO Abathur, you're useless"".  Each of these times I point them to the scoreboard.  There, I have top siege dmg, top hero dmg, and top xp contributed by over 30% of anyone else on the team. At this point they stop talking.  Yes, it LOOKS like we are not doing anything, but we are all over the map.  Please understand his playstyle before criticizing.  It's completely different from any other hero and it's not as easy as you would think.  I'm sure there are many bad Abathurs due to this, but there are many good ones too. Be kind to your Abathur. Let him know you are about to engage. Maybe tell him you will ping the map twice quickly to alert him that you need him. COMMUNICATE.      Sorry for the wall of text. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask as I would be more than happy to answer them.  Also, I'm not perfect so if you have anything to add or dispute with what I said, by all means say something. I'm always looking to learn as well.  In fact twice in the last week I found 2 new things I could do with Abathur I had never thought of before.  One requires the ultimate ability I don't generally pick but if I do, I will definitely keep it in mind.  Good luck and tell your Abathurs ""thank you"" if they help you get away or secure a kill."

If you are fighting, and believe you can beat someone in a fight, go all in.  If you are fairly low and need to survive, run away.  Abathur's are there to help you out, and if you happen to walk away when you should have engaged, I think most will forgive you because they can easily un-hat you, and hat another person in about 3 seconds."

The spike is a little burst, but that aoe is great at helping with wave clear.  Really, you should watch a video of someone playing Abathur so you can get an idea of what they're trying to accomplish. Watch a few different builds and try to understand what's going on from their side.  He's a really different kind of character, so if you haven't played him and aren't inclined to buy him try watching a couple videos and getting an idea of what's going on."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,dangerdan27,7,Mon Jul 13 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"What his hat does is basically add benefits to who you are, providing more damage and a shield. Depending on the Abathur, he can also provide some healing, increased movespeed, slows on the enemy, and so forth.  So pretty much, when you see that little icon above you, you are essentially 1.5 of a person, and it can help turn fights around early or late game."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,JeepCrew,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"It gives you a shield and some other buffs (he can talent into an Attack Speed increase, HoT on his shield, etc.)  The hat can also attack things for you, and even has its own talents that are attacks (an AoE damage ability and a skillshot).  He can also hat minions and structures, allowing you to shield a structure that's being sieged or help push a minion wave/soak xp."

As abathur I like nothing more than either being smack in the middle of a ton of creep, or having a clear shot to a healer/dps.  The purpose of us being there is to pretty much help you take a losing fight, and make it a winning one in about 30-50 seconds. A good abathur wont ever keep their hat on you longer than that, so try to spend as much of that time keeping yourself close to the fight. I do my best to opt toward the melee heroes because they're right in the thick of it, if that's you, you dont have to do anything. (Dont stay till you die, it takes us a second to get in another fight). If you're a ranged hero, just stand a little bit closer. For the most part you dont have to do anything."

So it's not very reliable, but can give some additional xp.  When Sylvanas uses possession on a minion it doesn't become hers, it just converts the minion to her side."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,404clichE,6,Mon Jul 13 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"I report them as cheating since in effect they are helping the enemy team. For Abathur if he isn't doing the symbiote thing much (where he goes into the cocoon) then he is most probably just afk, you can also tell by looking at the stat screen and seeing if his numbers go up.

I feel like every team needs a tank, healer, consistent damage, burst damage, [empty slot] at least, but in QM I hardly ever get a team that looks like this.  Also, are there are heroes that are specifically good on certain maps? For example, I feel like map control and thus early game skirmish power to shove people away from objectives is very important on Cursed Hollow and Haunted Bay. I would personally  always pick Rehgar or Uther as support/healer on these maps, because these two champs can push forward in fights, whereas the squishy healers have to kite back and walk away from objectives too much.. Does anyone else have examples of heroes that are good on certain maps?"
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,Soda4Matt,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"Most team comps have on average: 2 assassins, 1 healer, 1 tank, and flex. That flex can literally be anything that will fit the bill. Whether it be a specialist, another assassin, another support or another tank, it's whatever the draft looks like and whatever the team needs the most.  Heroes with global presence such as Falstad and Abathur benefit largely on bigger maps such as Sky Temple, Cursed Hollow and Blackheart's Bay.   Heroes with a lot of zoning control, such as Jaina, Kael'Thas and Valla are very good on objective heavy maps such as Cursed Hollow, Sky Temple, and Tomb of the Spider Queen.   Honestly, all heroes do well on each map, some maps favoring a bit better than others, but they all fit in some way."

On tomb of the spider queen or haunted mines, sylvanas is very good because stunning the towers give the objectives much more value (she is a solid first pick on haunted mines because of how late lvl 16 comes, but on tomb of the spider queen first picking kael'thas should still be the top priority).  The tier list for supports is the same for every map (pretty much, although there may be some things I am not thinking of). Supports should be chosen depending on what your team has, and what the enemy team has. If you have a melee assassin, choose uther for the divine shield, if the enemy got kael'thas, malfurion is probably not going to be able to outheal his burst (nobody can, although malf is probably the worst to try). In this patch, rehgar is probably always a solid pick and you should stick with him.  Generally in hl though, just try to pick kael'thas first and then jaina, if your team has both of them you probably win (although jaina and sylvanas are both better than kael'thas on haunted mines).

You earn it within hero visual radius if the above doesn't apply (special case abathurs top hat and body both count as his visual radius)

Since data is only propagated between the server and clients once every sixteenth of a second (or so the community has datamined from the engine behavior), a window already exists of sufficient size to compile all damage sources and award exp if a minion death and hero damage occur within the same frame.  To be fair, this is a hypothetical answer, but given what we know of the networking functionality in Hots it seems more reasonable to propose that the engine uses this opportunity to err in favor of the player rather than expend further computations to assert nano-second precision for last hits."

I know there's tons of guides out there on the heroes, but is there a good one for just the basics of the game? Like how to know when to leave a lane, or join a group battle, take camps etc..."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,Delta-Sniper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"There is a good map timers guide here http://www.replaysofthestorm.com/guide/2/map-timers  For laning you still want to soak till 10. If your team wants to go for a temple on Sky Temple or  tribute on CH you should go with them. Those are the rare times pre 10 that you want to leave lane. After you are done with the objective go back to laning. I find around 13-15 it's better for the team to stay together since the talents and death timers around this stage start to get higher and it's in everyone's best interest to stick together.  If your team wants to do an objective then go with them, it might be a stupid idea but you not being there hinders them even more. That's the most important thing imo, when you get past 10 go with your team and help even if you don't think it's a good idea.  Merc timings are something I still don't have down. I know on BoE if you can cap then as the immortals are spawning then the pushing power is immense since the enemy team has to decide between clearing the lanes or defending/attacking the immortals."

She needs a proper tank to play with that can initiate well because she needs to dive in. Much like Illidan you kind of need to build the team around her for her to be effective. It's easy to dive in too deep and die which is why she gets a bad rap.   I die a lot when I play warrior but that is okay if the rest of the team got to safety. The problem I personally find is that people think if I am with them then they can go nuts and usually pay the price for that by dying. Knowing when to retreat is something most people don't learn.

I found some useful gameplay videos from MFPallytime that brought this to my attention.  So like we all know, normally you right click to move.  When you do this the green arrows appear pointing to the spot where you just clicked.  Well with MFPallytime on his videos he will be right clicking right clicking and then on a click they will turn red.  It looks like he is hitting a key while he clicks and it tells his character to attack in that direction but to not move.  So I guess my question is what is the click + key combination to do this?  Or am I way off and this doesn't exist.  Thanks."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,Rkynick,2,Mon Jul 13 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on the map. Although a lot of people may want to fight early on maps like Blackheart's, it's better to just send 4 top side and 1 to solo bottom lane. The 4 top will be able to contest the top chest when it spawns, while the bottom one contests the bottom.  But about 90% of the time, it's more beneficial to play it safe and not give up any kills early because it seems to make people go on tilt and yeah."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,orangeway69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:26:40 2015 UTC,Yeah actually a great point. Also on mines I like to push the golem lane early on. If you can take a tower or two it really helps as your golem can push further.
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,maldrame,2,Tue Jul 14 08:38:16 2015 UTC,"At levels 1-3, a minion wave is worth more experience than a hero kill.  It isn't until level ~10 that hero kills become significantly more worthwhile than laning.  Therefore, up until level 10 your primary source of exp will come from laning and minions.    That said, this fact does not prevent the psychological effects of killing or getting killed by players.  Though it is very unlikely to swing the end result of a game, it's possible to set the mood by getting in a good team fight, or not, right at the beginning.  The best idea is generally to play smart and refrain from engaging, but feel free to poke and harass while the lanes build up."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,orangeway69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:19:49 2015 UTC,Also consider the fact that killing a hero may deny them a minion wave's worth of XP :)
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,maldrame,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Alternatively, you can achieve the same effect more safely by bullying the opponent out of the lane.  If you can force them to take an early well or return to base you can deny them just as much experience.  But, again, this isn't notable in the same manner as a hero kill, and doesn't carry as much oomph for how most players feel."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,orangeway69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"Get in lane. Exp is far more important than a watchtower at the start of the game. If you see the enemy bunched up going in one lane that lane should just poke them while the towers help them while your team has 2 lanes to themselves. You will soon see a level gap rising. Yesterday we hit level 4 before the opponents hit level 2. The rest of the game was basically a steam roll as they just kept throwing themselves at us, after we hit level 10 we bunched up and there wasn't a lot they could do"

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,gmorf33,3,Mon Jul 13 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"Smart cast will cast your abilities at your mouses cursor without you having to click your mouse. so you click Q, it will be cast immediately where your mouse it. There is also the other casting option where you hold Q and on release it gets casts this allows you to see where it will go but instead of relying on your mouse it relies on your keyboard.  also this:  you can queue commands with the shift key. so shift click, shift click will move to the first click position then the next shift position. This works with abilities, recalling, collecting from moon well. anything really.  You can save location on the map with ctrl + f5 - f9. So find some where on the map hit ctrl+f5. then just push f5 to go to that saved location.  You can use the alt key to use abilities at your current location, or cast them on yourself. So Alt + Q as Uther, (I think that is his targeted heal) will heal himself no mis-clicking. Also alt + w will cast Jainies aoe on her current location.  Ctrl+1 - 5 will select your talent for you. so holding ctrl will bring up your talent selection the numbers 1-5 will then select the talent from top to bottom top being 1.  Also simply holding the mouse down will move your character no need to right click to move.  Also S/H will stop/hold your position.  Holding space will keep your character centered in the screen.  ctrl+alt+f will bring up a fps/ping tracker."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,maldrame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:26 2015 UTC,I only started with Sylv last week and loved her. I worry less about hero damage but my siege damage and exp were top in every QM I played. That's how I feel she can have a massive impact. Early level advantages are brilliant as they help greatly when team fighting over objectives. Typically when involved in a team fight stay back and don't die. She can do very decent damage even while running away with her Q. She can vanquish minion waves ridiculously fast so even while crossing lanes to get to an objective she can get chunks of exp. She can handle any merc camp solo except a boss and can help them push by shutting down towers and forts.
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,GrawrHS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:29:44 2015 UTC,"Sylv isn't really for damage, your role as Sylv (from someone who only has her at level 5) is to push lanes and then silence with your ult to initiate or clean up team fights or help your team escape from a lost team fight.  I don't know all her talents off the top of my head but you want the ones that explode minions when they die under black arrow affect, make people vulnerable with your w, and those sorts of talents so that you can push really well."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,ProfXanthos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"Most likely just dying too much.  I've found the games i fall behind on damage/takedown stats are the games i've died the most.  You just miss out on so much while you're dead for 45-60 seconds + travel time to get back in the action.  Early game, use your trait to keep pressure on your lane and rack up some damage on their fort if possible (but don't over extend!).  When enemy starts poking back at you, just retreat and use your 'Q' which can be done while running away without stopping.  That will dissuade them from chasing.  The big thing is to just STAY ALIVE.  Retreat early while you're learning the limitations of your hero and learning the nuances of the PvP interactions.  That was the hardest thing for me to learn (and still is) about this game.  Retreat early and live to fight on.  Mid/Late game you need to stay with your team a lot more.  Sylv is really valuable in teamfights with her 'R' arrow silence.  Learn to hit that (hit 'R' a second time to activate the explosion) consistently.  On maps with pushing objectives you can really shine (Mines, and BoE) because you can supplement the push really well with your trait.  Split pushing is a solid Sylv strategy if your team realizes and works with it and you know when to do it, but i think it's a trap a lot of new players fall into (myself included), thinking they must solo/split push their lane all game long.  What ends up happening is you just die a lot or you put your team in a big disadvantage in teamfights being 4v5 all game."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,comic_serif,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"How exp works.   does some range have like ""not 100% exp range""   Not sure what you mean by that.   is it possible to 2 lane with summons?   Do you mean is it possible for summoned units to soak in the same manner as your hero?  No.  Summoned units do not soak.  Only Heroes can soak, and some specific mechanics (ie Abathur Hat) can soak as well.  All summoned units are considered an extension of Hero damage.  So if your summoned unit lands a killing blow, just like a hero ability, you'll gain exp regardless of your range from the minion.   at what timer does merc spawn? is it time-wise or map-event wise?   The mercs will appear at a certain point in time in the game (roughly 2:00, I think.  Don't quote me on that).  Each time they are killed the camp will display a timer until the mercs respawn.  These are, technically, the only two states in which you can find the merc camps.  On cooldown or off cooldown.    Now, technically, the camps will disappear during certain objectives (Dragon Knight, Spiders, Plant Horror, etc).  But this doesn't intervene on the aforementioned state.  Camps on cooldown will continue to count down their timer.  Camps who are neutral will reappear as soon as the objective is over.  Mercs who have been claimed and are in lane will remain in play as normal.  Pro Tip: if an objective which removes access to the camps starts up but you can still see a camp active on the minimap, it means the opposing team is there attempting to claim the camp.  Otherwise the icon would have disappeared.   does capturing merc as soon as possible affect push power? or do I need to wait for timing to actually capturing merc to make it take effect?   Technically, as long as you're pushing with the mercs, it will increase your push power.  However, this is proportional to the amount of push you can create on your own (treat mercs as a scalar to your own pushing power) and the time of the game (merc power scales with game time, so mercs captured as soon as they appear are less powerful than those captured 1 minute after they appear).  Furthermore, not all mercs scale at the same rate.  The Boss, for example, starts very weak and scales very well.  At level 10 the boss is little more than a nuisance, even with player support.  At level 20 the boss is one of the strongest pushing points in the game.  Siege and Bruisers, however, scale a little more slowly.  They're more useful earlier in the game, but their power won't spike like the boss in the late game."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,cooldeadpunk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"The game is built to handle it. Stick together, deal with danger, soak easy XP for creep waves, try and disrupt the enemy from getting boss or mercs and above all survive. I hate when my team has a level deficit and continue to throw themselves at the enemy Heroes and end up being outnumbered and outgunned, giving easy kills and thus feeding them further."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,gmorf33,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:22:21 2015 UTC,Critical to soak and play defense until you reach level 10.  Then you can group up and try and pick off some enemies that have overextended.
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,JetBrink,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"Two things:   Stalling benefits the team that's behind. If both teams are just soaking, they will equalize eventually. Hence, you can play very defensively and stabilize. Kills benefit the team that is behind much more. It will only take a few kills to catch up, and if you trade 1 for 1 ( i.e. one of you dies and one of the enemies dies ) the team that is behind will come out ahead in that trade."

NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,eaglessoar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"Alright, in that case we need a little more information.  What aspects of positioning do you feel are difficult?  Who are your favorite heroes to play, and how do you currently position them?  Which heroes do you feel are the most difficult to position against?"
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,eaglessoar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"Well I've played most of my games as tanks and I recently begun an assassin play style. Zera and Jaina quickly became some of my favorites. I do decent dmg I guess and a good amount of kills, but I feel that I die a little too much, since I'm really squishy."
NexusNewbies,3d4m1x,Delta-Sniper,2,Tue Jul 14 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah.  Warriors and Assassins have greatly different styles of positioning.  It's good to understand the behavior from the perspective of each, but you can certainly pick up bad habits while transitioning from one to the other.  Especially when going from tanks to assassins.  The most base, ground level rule of positioning an assassin properly is this: staying alive is more important than killing opponents.  This rule has three basic tenants.  First, never lead the battle.  That isn't your job.  That's the Warrior's job.  Or, if not the warrior, then someone else who is tankier than you.  Your job is to stay alive and get kills.  Which, in both cases, is easier to do when you let someone else faceplant the enemy team.  A lot of idea of positioning revolves around timing.  You want to be in the correct position at the correct time.  If your team has a tank running in to start a battle, the correct position is slightly behind them, and you want to ensure you're just close enough to engage right as they do (timing) while standing just far enough from your opponents that they'll need to fight through your tank to deal any damage to you (position).  Second, always have a clean escape route.  It is easier than you might think to position around your opponents such that you become cornered, or to put your opponent between yourself and the escape route.  It is also easier than you might think to unexpectedly lose your escape route.  This is essentially the fundamental tactic of a good lane-gank.  Goad the player into overextending in the lane (they'll think to themselves, ""I have that whole big, clear lane behind me, of course I can get away""), and then put one of your friends in the middle of their lane.  An area that was big, open, and safe immediately becomes a pinch.  If you aren't absolutely certain you know where your opponents are located, then you should always expect them to show up in your escape route.    Third, only position aggressively when you are absolutely certain you can kill the target and still escape safely.  Think about how it works for lane ganks.  Get in, pinch, kill (alternatively, try to kill but let it go when they get in range of their towers), run back to your towers.  Do the same thing with other situations.  Get in, pinch, kill (or be ready to give it up if you can't), get back to safety.  It needs to be quick and effective.  If you can't pull it off like that, then chances are high they'll get some friends to show up and make you regret the attempt.  Just like this.  That is every bad positioning tactic in one clip.  Fighting under towers without protection, starting the attack without ready teammates, starting the attack without knowing nearby opponent's positions, sticking around too long after the kill failed, and doing the whole thing in a location with no safe escape route.  If you can get those three basics to work for you, you'll have solved a large majority of your positioning tactics as an assassin.  The rest is all just fine tuning on those three."

NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,TheUnseenAvenger,2,Mon Jul 13 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"I think u have a great list there. I would just grab who I like if I were u.   But if u really want a suggestion(though u might need to build a comp around him/her): Assassin: Butcher. Support: BW though I don't have much exp with her, but she pretty much counters hard-melee heroes. Warriors: ETC? Diablo for early roam ganking. Specialists: TLV is u enjoy them."
NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,Eriennyl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:35 2015 UTC,thanks yeah just seeing if there is anyone else that is strong that I could add to my list. I was thinking tyrael and falstad.
NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,Eriennyl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"Tyrael is great in a 2 warriors comp, though usually ppl run 1 warr. Or u're playing a less burst, chaser comp due to Smite that allows ur team to chase. Falstad in the right hands is a solid choice but ppl often overlook him due to his early game weakness compared to other heroes, easy to avoid heroic(other which u really need coordination to pull off a wombo-combo, or BW just do a similar job and better). Honestly if Falstad was 4k I would pick him, but at 7k .. Nah."
NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,Eriennyl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"alright thanks for the input. out of the assassins I dont have (kerrigan, nova, tychus, etc) who would you recommend most if I was going to buy an assassin or warrior as well?"
NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,transmogrify,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:38 2015 UTC,"Kerrigan is still very solid despite the B4B and Envenom nerfs. I don't have much exp playing Tychus or Nova but I played quite abit with them in my team.   I'd prefer Tychus due to his solid laning potential, and both his ult if used properly deals a crazy deal of dmg. Nova is good if u like to QM pub stomp, but easily countered. Losing her Gathering Power stacks means a big deal to her and experienced players will shut her down easily or counter play. Both her ults are easily blocked/avoided.   Edit: Warriors I think u're set! Diablo is still an early game roam-ganking initiator with the right comp. Sonya uh not much experience with her. Chen is just way bad compared to the other warriors. Maybe wait for Leoric?"
NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,N8CCRG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:33:59 2015 UTC,true yeah thanks for the advice. maybe ill get tychus and try him out only 4k gold. and i also want kerrigan and falstad anyway. falstad is fun
NexusNewbies,3d5f4j,ckax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"Consider: ETC, Murky, Tassadar, Butcher. Those are all considered powerful additions to what you list above.  The thing is, if you're just starting out, play whatever you like and you're good at. A lot of people pay too much attention to high level meta and don't think for themselves. Only the highest subset of players are so mechanically perfect in the game that they need to worry about hitting the limits on what their hero is capable of doing. Player skill and strategy matters more than hero tier. I would rather win with Arthas in a HL game than lose because I picked a hyped hero that isn't my style like ETC. The fact that I'm HL 35 and not HL 1 lets me do that."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,MEATER78,2,Mon Jul 13 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"These are the heroes I took:  Assassins:  Jaina 10k  Valla 2k  Illidan 4k  Raynor 2k  Warriors:  ETC 2k  Anub'arak 4k  Muradin 2k  Supports:  Rehgar 7k  Uther 7k  Malfurion 2k  Specialists:  Sylvanas 10k  That's 11 heroes. Those are the ones I took before heroes league. That's 52k. I tried for a well balanced roster, but of course it was skewed towards the cheaper heroes. You could probably afford to take more expensive heroes since you have more gold, maybe Zeratul instead of Raynor and Johanna instead of ETC."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,randplaty,2,Mon Jul 13 17:58:12 2015 UTC,"As someone who was very recently in the same boat, this list is basically exactly what I went for, and it's great.  A good mix of currently strong heroes and lower prices.  I'll make a couple comments based on a new players perspective:  Assassins: A lot of people recommend KT instead of Jaina.  I know you said you really sucked with KT, but even regardless I find Jaina to be the better pick.  A bit more survivability and still very strong damage.  I find Jaina a lot more fun and easier to pick up.  I'd honestly try and get Zeratul in there if you can swing it.  He is incredibly strong and (IMO) super fun to play.  I also found him to be much more intuitive than Illidan, but maybe that's just me.  I'd personally swap him in this list for Illidan, as Raynor can be a decent backup if the enemy picks Valla/Jaina, but you do whatever you feel more comfortable with.  I'd put Tychus in an honorable mention as well.  Warriors: This grouping is fantastic both for the current meta and for starting players on a budget.  If you want to add something a bit stronger, swapping ETC for Johanna would be a good bet.  I find Jo to be incredibly fun, but she is very expensive so it might not fit in your budget.  If you like Warriors, she is a must buy at some point IMO.  Supports: Perfect list.  Pick these three, never look back.  Could throw LiLi in for variety healer-wise, or a Tass/Tyrande for double support comps (I prefer Tass) but really don't need any more than this.  Specialists: This is a hard one.  I'm not great at specialists and they are all hard to quantify, but I think Sylvanas is a must-buy for starting HL.  She's just too good.  Only other thing I would add is that Zagara is also very solid.  I wouldn't swap Sylv for her, but if you wanted to fill out your Specialist pool a bit, she would be the one to add.  Hope this helps a bit, and good luck in HL!"
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,DudesMcCool,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:15:46 2015 UTC,"awesome, thanks a lot for the fast reply.  Is Raynor viable in HL? Do you get flamed by your team for picking him?  EDIT: I actually go flames from my team in quick match for picking Raynor :( I kinda like Raynor though, just for the Starcraft flavor."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,THE_Rubber_Ducky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"You have quite a bit of gold. Since you have so much gold, I would get the 4 or 5 heroes you enjoy playing the most, and then fill in the roles after that with decent heroes to fill the void.  Rand made a pretty good list. I would add Tychus to that as well, not a bad option for 4k, and plays similar to Raynor (with less flaming)  As for getting flamed with Raynor, don't worry about it. People tend to think Raynor as a bad choice, but there is no such thing as a ""bad"" choice. Not knowing how a character is played makes it a ""bad"" choice. If you're comfortable with Raynor, by all means, keep picking Raynor."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,randplaty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly have never picked Raynor yet so I don't know. I've played with a couple Raynors with no problem, but granted small sample size. I say if you like the guy, get him."

Put up a solid list for u, specialists are kinda hard since they play kinda differently. Still quite some leftover gold for u to pick what u like.  IMO for my list: Tanks are good(u might like Jojo), Assassins -Jaina/KT, Zeratul, Kerrigan/Butcher, Support - If u like BW after the changes, Tassadar(on certain maps, or counter comps). Tyrande(if u play with friends, solid roaming gank and back line support). Specialists - Sylvanas (10k but solid pick, though Zag is so damn good for a 7k),"

Not aiming her heals felt strange, so I might go with Malfurion instead."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,gasface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, Malf! Sorry for missing him out. He's a solid pick.  Zag is a very strong sustained dps and a hard counter to similar lanes melee orientated heroes(most not all). Honestly if Zag and Sylv were both 10k I would go Sylvanas. Both play differently though so go with who u're comfortable u like. If u have the gold to spare get both! Though at 7k Zag is really very solid once u're used to her. :)"
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,hacdladf1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"ok, I might have to take another look at Zag and maybe check out a guide or two. I definitely liked spreading the creep and dominating the lane early on but felt a little lost once the team fighting started."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,gmorf33,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"The key with Zag is to press your early advantage, which can turn into a level lead, which is important because like you said, you can feel a little lost during team fights since her damage doesn't scale as well. The strategy to team fighting is to target their squishy DPS with Hunter Killer and to throw more damage into the mix with Banelings and Roaches from the backline. Maw is the competitive ULT, which will let you turn a 5v5 team fight into a 5v3 or 5v2. Absolutely dominating."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,monkJ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Makes a lot of sense :) Never thought of it that way, but I actually leveled Zag mostly playing vs. AI feeling uncomfortable with her after the first two games (and wanting to get her to five asap for which grinding AI games is usually faster)."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,ckax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"If you feel uncomfortable and don't enjoy playing a hero, then don't buy them just because they are 'meta' and so good. Unless you enjoy them or are good with them, it's not worth having them. There are other heroes to fill whatever role. Find the one you're good with and/or enjoy and buy them instead. Zagara and Sylvanas are both supposed to be top tier specialist picks, but I own neither and get along fine."
NexusNewbies,3d5fll,nightshiftb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"Zag's biggest strength for team fights is getting a Maw ('R') down on the enemy team.  Timing it to hit right after they pop their big buff heroics is even better (like illidan's metaphorphisis, muradin avatar, tass archon, etc) because it doesn't pause their timers/cooldowns like Void Prism does.  So they lose 5 seconds off their big play plus you do damage to them, plus your team gets a chance to get better position and/or kill off the enemies who didn't get maw'd.  That and you can put a ton of pressure on their back line squishies with hunter killer (especially if you talent for mutalisk).  The vision from your creep tumors is also huge for keeping teammates safe from ambush ganks or big flanks."

Don't lead the charge. Depending on how you build him you can get some pretty awesome bites in with lunge. His shield is also a great source of damage. It's probably safest to start poking in after someone from the other side has died or someone is very near death.  Uther, idk :/"

NexusNewbies,3d3t8r,Eriennyl,3,Mon Jul 13 09:03:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Btw when in wolf form u deal extra or crit dmg, so it helps alot to always go into wolf when its off cd for that extra dps. And if u're attacking something that doesn't die that fast like the temple giants, siege etc u only need to right click once and press ""z"" whenever its off cd instead of ""z"" right click, ""z"" right click.   Of course if ppl are closing in on u from their minimap location then save it to back off. Another thing is if u took Feral heart(which is usually 90% of the time) at lvl4 then try to maximize ur wolf form to get that extra regen when u are not in a spot to engage anything.  And lastly, the slow totem helps alot. If u get caught out when ""z"" is on cd, drop a totem and u get that extra inch to run. Or rush ahead and drop a totem when chasing a kill.   I don't play Uther though, can't help."

NexusNewbies,3d3t8r,Rkynick,3,Mon Jul 13 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really know if Uther or Rehgar are supposed to have much more hero damage than that. As a healer you really don't want to be focused down, so staying in the back line and not auto attacking isn't a horrible idea. Your team shouldn't be looking to you for damage. I guess a potential way to judge ""damage"" would be to look at takedowns. If you're on par with the rest of your team, you're probably doing fine.  I think that Rehgar can jump in and out with his wolf form/maybe lightning shield, but Uther really won't have much hero damage in general. Diving in will usually just be asking for trouble. The most aggressive I could see him is using Benediction for double Hammer of Justice to set up a kill, or running Divine Storm."
NexusNewbies,3d3t8r,Boobtape,3,Mon Jul 13 11:04:43 2015 UTC,"With Uther, it depends on the enemy team composition a lot. If the enemy team is stacked with ranged assassins or reliable stuns, engaging will be difficult for you & you should play very safely. Your general strategy should be: deal damage, stun with your hammer & run. You probably want to use your hammer to shut down any chasing, so consider not opening up the engagement with it, just so that you have it ready to run. If you take the hammer cooldown talent at lv. 1, however, you can pretty much spam it as much as you want. The one time I would suggest using hammer to engage is when you're trying to gank with your team."
NexusNewbies,3d3m5j,spyxy_kt,3,Mon Jul 13 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"Getting heroes to level 5 gives 500 gold/hero.  So level up all the free rotation heroes each week.  The starter pack in the store comes with malf, raynor, muradin and a 7 day stim pack for $5 if you don't mind dropping a little money.  The stim packs give you an additional 150% gold I believe. Not sure.  Queue times have been longer than usual these last few days for me as well.  I would imagine heroes on free rotation would take longer to find games since so many people are playing them. You can level them up in Vs. AI (and I think Training also, but don't quote me on that).  HL gives more XP than QM which gives more XP than vs AI though A player has to be present in the lane but does not have to attack the minions.  You have to be about 2/3 of the screen or closer to get the dying minion's XP. Could be a number of things, missing skill shots, not sticking with the team post lvl 10, going for mercs when your team is pushing.  Best advice I can give is to watch Twitch streams or youtube channels like MFPallyTime or SchAmToo. When you're ahead in levels or facing people who stay spread apart, Zeratul is easy.  When the team you're facing has a lot of CC and is well-organized, things get a bit trickier.  Since you just started playing, people probably don't know how to spot Zera, but practice Blinking in to combat from a bush, unleashing your attacks and blinking out (once you get Wormhole at lvl 13).  A good Void Prison placement also separates good Zeras from mediocre ones imo. Think of Sonya more like a hybrid Warrior/Assassin rather than just a pure tank.  Don't YOLO into the enemy team like you would with Johanna. She can 1v1 almost any hero early game and is a great initiator with her ult (can't remember the name) Yeah Valla is ""easy"" but you have to learn good positioning or you will be punished.  Practice Stutter Stepping with her (and any hero, really) to avoid poke damage.The cool thing about Valla is that she has 3 legitimate builds, solid DPS or decent burst depending on how you build her, and a great escape with Vault.  Use Vault to escape, not leap into combat! I haven't played much with Anub, and he recently got nerfed last patch, but he has a great initiation/chase with his burrow and a great ranged stun.  His beetles can still do quite a bit of damage, but you have to be mindful of his low hp pool, like Sonya. Raynor i'm assuming? :p He's pretty much an auto-attacker. Spam W on cooldown and be wary of your positioning since unlike Valla, he doesn't have an escape.  Your Q can be used offensively or defensively when running away.  Just make sure you don't save your opponents by pushing them back when your teammate is about to kill them lol.   If you know what playstyle you enjoy I can recommend some heroes for you"
NexusNewbies,3d3m5j,Ryguy_69,2,Mon Jul 13 07:35:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks man ~   If you know what playstyle you enjoy I can recommend some heroes for you   It's really hard for me to even say at this point, as Ive only tried a few characters... Usually I prefer rdps in games but this is my first moba since wc3 beta, and I had the most fun as Zeratul so far. Mostly I was just roaming the map from lane to lane looking for badly positioned people to gank or scare away which was a fun playstyle for me.   On sonya I was trying to sit a lane and break down towers and assist with objs and kills, but I felt I usually ended up in a lane by myself, and whoever is good at killing me on the other team would just harass me. I had some fun matches on her but felt like I couldnt really do much to other players harassing me, especially rdps like vallah and the night elf hunter girl.   And zeruatul basically would destroy me every single match as I could never outrun him and my only escape was my leap ultimate... which is obviously not so great to waste on running away.  I usually enjoy playing highly agile characters in other games that are very mobile and get in/out quickly, and basically just frustrate the opposition. Like pikachu in smash, or hunters in wow, I was also curious about illidian as he seemed similar to zeratul. But zeratul is def my favorite so far."
NexusNewbies,3d3m5j,Ryguy_69,2,Mon Jul 13 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah man, Zeratul sounds like a good fit then.  He's one of my favorite heroes too!  You might like Illidan too, I haven't played him much.  Watch a guide video on him and see if you like his playstyle.

NexusNewbies,3d3m5j,KKYBoneAEA,3,Mon Jul 13 08:49:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm gonna go straight down the list with the best I can answer you with.  1. For Gold: Win. And Buy a stimpack ($3.99 for a week), do your daily challenges every time they are up, and play with a friend. Stimpacks increase gold by 25 (i think, or somewhere close to 25) per game, and give you boosted exp. Playing with a friend will up your exp and give a better chance at winning.    Queue Time: You match with people roughly based off your level in matchmaking, and your ratio of wins to losses you have. I do not know of a way that you can personally do something to reduce the queue times, but mine are never really TOO long....its just a matter of waiting it out.  Leveling Heroes: You can play in Training mode, which is against AI. It is best for trying out new heroes that you have just purchased, or that are free for the week. Also, it is a good place to get past the talent-gates. The downside is that the AI gets predictable, so it can lead you to get comfortable playing one way, when in Quick Match real people are less predictable and play differently.  Exp. Soaking: This is a VERY vital part of the early game (level 1-10). In order to actually receive the exp, you or a friendly hero must be in a lane, either killing minions or being pretty close to them when they die. ALWAYS try to be sure that there is at least 1 friendly teammate in every lane. Soaking needs to be a priority in the early game. Try to focus soaking and avoiding teamfights until after your team reaches level 10, because in the early game, clearing a wave of minions generates more exp for the team than killing a hero. This changes post-level 10 though.  Noob stuff: Everyone is going to call you noob or dog you in a game at some point. it is inevitable, in any game. The best thing to do when they call you something, is to check your strategy and see if you are doing something wrong. If you aren't, great, just continue on and forget the haters. That being said, do not confuse criticism of you in a game by the team for insults. Your team wants to help you be better, so they can win. If you receive critique, try to take it as only criticism and not hate/trolling.    Heroes Tips For any hero you are unsure of, watch gameplay on youtube or twitch of them and their builds, or read guides online of them. Seeing strategy played out does wonders.   Zeratul- In my Top 3 favs on HOTS, and he is my highest win-rate character. His big thing is roaming. In a game, there will be friendly players in each lane soaking exp. As a stealth assassin, Zera is very weak and squishy alone, so you need to roam through different lanes, checking on each friendly and assisting them if they need it. Do not directly engage a full health target alone, you will die if you are not careful. So just roam, use your Q to burst some minion waves pre-level 10, and pick off enemies when they have low health.  I have not played Sonya barely any, but she is a warrior, and therefore needs to be utilized in the frontline, to soak damage and deal damage to the enemy team. Thats all I have on her.  Valla: As with all ranged assassins, Valla is very squishy. Positioning is absolutely critical for her to survive. So, stay back, use your range and auto attack speed to do damage, and always have vault (E) ready to escape. But remember, Positioning is the key. Watch some videos of her gameplay for a good place to start.  Anub'Arak: Also a Warrior, Anub belongs at the frontline, soakng damage for the team and dealing damage. His Q should be used to stun enemies on their escape for the team to kill, or better yet, for stunning Li-Li and Malfurion during their Heals. Always use his W for a small shield, and his E is very useful as an escape, as Anub is a relatively squishy tank.  Tychus- He is an assassin, so he is squishy up close. Positioning is key to his survival also. He has the quickest auto-attack speed in the game, allowing him to pump out damage. Stay back, use W grenades to displace enemies and clear minions/structures, and E is kinda an escape. His E does not have long range at all so good positioning is your best escape. A tip for him I use is to pick up Vampiric Assault at level 4, since his auto-attack speed is so quick and it will heal you on each auto attack.    I hope I did not miss anything, and I know other redditors will have better tips and such.  Hope I was able to answer some questions for ya."

I also just realized that I go back to heal up a lot and should probably try to avoid fighting more (taking less damage) and just soak exp, as I didnt realize this was a thing even... lol.   5.Tychus- He is an assassin   It was actually raynor, I remembered thanks to the other guys post. But Tychus sounds fun too.   You can play in Training mode, which is against AI. It is best for trying out new heroes that you have just purchased, or that are free for the week.

NexusNewbies,3d1zx8,mcandre,7,Sun Jul 12 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"This is espeically true if Nova takes the antiarmor shells talent at 7. It gives her autoattack 250% damage but at the cost of 4 seconds between attacks. All her ability cooldowns are 10 seconds or more. This leaves Nova with the choice of blowing her ult to clear minion waves (assuming she chose Precision Strike because it's generally the more useful ult) or waiting and hoping someone else responds. And if enemy heroes are pushing in with the minions? Precision Strike will only zone them back for a few seconds. If they look at the minimap and see the other four heroes at their core or base they know Nova is alone and has nothing else to stop them.   This PSA could also go for other heroes with poor waveclear. I can't count the number of times I pinged a merc push or minion buildup to have to go to take it out myself on a support character. Not only does it take twice as long because of lack of damage and abilities not suited for this, but it takes your healer out of the fight which probably means if the enemy team decides to engage and capitalize on this, they will win the teamfight. The only time this used to work out was when I was Brightwing but her damage nerfs have made her unable to waveclear merc pushes in a timely manner anymore. And half the time I usually couldn't clear the wave before it got a gate or a fort or even a keep sometimes.  So please be mindful, not just on Nova, but any hero with poor waveclear and low damage pinging a minion buildup or merc push. Some heroes just can't clear the waves effectively and it's just going to hurt things further if you are just asking ""why don't you do it yourself?"" when they can't."

It's so sad :(  Once I was playing Malf in a three lane map where three teammates were all in a single lane and the one that wasn't was following me around. If I went top, he came top. If I went mid, he followed me mid. I didn't have enough DPS to cycle properly (so I would have wavecleared both lanes) and with him he didn't understand that if he wants to stick with me, he has to do that.  Then I got a lot of QQ for ""omg malf why are you there we need heals here! worst heals ever. 0 heals omg!! malf delete game!!!"". This was before we were anywhere close to 10, while laneing and not doing objectives/preventing enemy group push/etc.  Also, this was hero league, around rank 25 or so.

NexusNewbies,3d2pf1,spyxy_kt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:20:37 2015 UTC,"Easiest answers would be anyone whose most popular heroic is the second one. I'll list the standouts here:  Chen: My vote for the worst. Outside of the severely nerfed Keg, the only talent picked at least 20% of the time available at talent gating is Swift Reflexes. Such a rough life.  Murky: No Octo-Grab or Living the Dream or Rewind vastly reduces Murky's damage output. You still get the 13-16 Pufferfish talents and your main Level 1 options, but your damage will really only come from Slime.  Sgt. Hammer: No Maelstrom Shells, First Aid, Napalm Strike, or Hover Siege Mode/Graduating Range. It will be so much harder to stay safe as Hammer.  Zeratul: Yeah, no VP is pretty dang bad. And no Wormhole means it's a little harder to engage safely. And the usual level 20 woes. But he can run Focused Attack with Follow Through to allow for a still decent amount of burst.  EDIT: Jaina and Johanna also technically follow this rule but they still get a lot of talents they would be using otherwise, so I can't say if they're worse than beetle-less Anub. Also all the things that need Bolt of the Storm for escaping are completely screwed by talent gating."
NexusNewbies,3d2pf1,micfijasan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:34:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like zeratul isn't that gated tbh, at lvl 1, you have okay options in block or greater cleave (I take block sometimes even not gated against heavy attackers like butcher on the enemy team), and at 4 and 7, you have the standard build with focused attack and follow through, not having VP at 10 is pretty bad though, at 13, you can work with giant killer (sucks to not having wormhole, but since you have shadow assault, you don't really have to blink in to go in, so you can save blink for escaping), double bombs at 16 is standard, and at 20, not having rewind sucks  so all in all, he is viable enough for QM even with expert talents, now heroes like kerrigan has serious issues since most of her good talents are actives and are gated"

Had top damage and takedowns in a QM with this setup. Shadow assault isnt really bad either unless you are fighting a team that's synergizing well and everyone is very hard to takedown.  One thing I don't get is why everyone takes focused attack over vampiric embrace, I've been using the vamp embrace because I can just soak and heal up at the same time to save myself trips to base and get just a little bit extra exp for the team simulteanously, and I usually get takedowns just fine without the focused attack... Although I'm still pretty new to him and new in general."

Basically when I took it over vampiric embrace I had to port back to base 50x each match just to keep going which is obviously no good. So I took vamp emb and just laned for a few seconds when I needed to heal up, which was effective for the group compositions /skill level I was at."

NexusNewbies,3d1hc2,its_sleeze,2,Sun Jul 12 19:16:17 2015 UTC,Launching your e in one direction and running in another direction is often the best way to put distance between you and your foes.

Also include a mid and late game part to the guide. Too many times I see a newbie Sylvanas not helping in team fights when she can delete an opponent like an assassin.
NexusNewbies,3d1hc2,xaelra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"good feedback. The builds are something that will come. I've just got to get it right because builds can change, sometimes often!  The mid and late game section are certainly something of interest, as I agree with some perhaps not really knowing what to do at those stages."
NexusNewbies,3d1hc2,dpanzella,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:47:29 2015 UTC,Good point about builds changing - but along those lines heroes and how they play will change over time too. Look at how much Murky has changed as an example. A beginners guide to Murky would look completely different from Alpha to now and would have changed at least 4 - 5 times.  Your guides will have to evolve over time. Sylvanas is no different. I mean Possession is almost viable now. Another iteration of it and Sylvanas as we know her will change forever.

NexusNewbies,3d2zom,felixlicat,2,Mon Jul 13 06:14:06 2015 UTC,If you right click to a location while you're cloaked Nova shouldn't auto attack. (I tested this out in training mode. Was standing in the middle of a wave and she wasn't attacking at all.) You might be doing one of two things:   A-moving to a location accidentally right clicking on a minion while you're trying to reposition.
NexusNewbies,3d2zom,awwnuts07,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:38:49 2015 UTC,This! A-moving to any location where any enemy is within auto attack shooting distance hits the closest enemy.
NexusNewbies,3d2zom,Skaitavia,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking this as I have run into this too. Sometimes it seems like she attacks nearby minions for no reasons, other times not.  I think it had to do with how recently I attacked something. Seemed to happen most often after I was escaping a team fight."
NexusNewbies,3d2zom,JeepCrew,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"As a new Nova player, I've gotten myself into several traps:   Fast and hard-to-see AOE abilities, such as Abathur's Spike Burst, can damage/reveal Nova. Solution: Maintain distance from Abathur. Accidentally attack/right-click on enemy or neutral target. Solution: Take care when attack/right-clicking to move. Don't click so much in bushes and other fog of war areas, where a valid attack target can suddenly appear. Minion waves follow Nova after she is revealed. Solution: Get the fuck out of there, through bushes if possible. Nova keeps autoattacking a minion like an idiot. Solution: Get the fuck out of autoattack range. The Stop key doesn't actually stop autoattacking, good job there Blizzard."
NexusNewbies,3d2zom,JeepCrew,2,Mon Jul 13 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"Your second item is my MAIN problem on every character. I click tons, as I'm sure many people do, but my clicks are more general direction and not precise.  This casuses problems when clicking to run away as my clicks sometimes go on the other side of a wall and suddenly my low-hp hero is charging back into a group of enemies. Gotta break this habit lol.  This is the reason I enjoyed Smite so much (besides the gameplay, but main reason I tried Smite). WASD controls ftw.   Thanks for the tips :)"
NexusNewbies,3d1vwr,mrrreow,5,Sun Jul 12 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"Several bosses have bushes near them, so these ideas can be combined!  The ol' gank bush tactic means hiding in a bush with your teammates and jumping out to ambush the enemies as they pass.  Baiting the boss means making it clear to the enemy that you're on the way to the boss (passing through their vision, perhaps by running past their minions or a watchtower they've captured), but surprising them with a gank when they get there to try to stop you.  GL HF!"
NexusNewbies,3d1vwr,angrmgmt00,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:50 2015 UTC,4 of you hide in a bush/out of sight. One person shows themselves going up to the boss/wandering alone and just basically being bait. They need to lure the other team into the bush where yours is hiding and boom.  I had a game where my team did the bait and bush on BoE and it was hilarious since we would have lost the game without that team wipe. Video here if you want to see it in action.

Otherwise use it to protect squishies from melee champs, to stop enemies from disengaging or to allow your team to disengage.   Trying to walk through their frontline to root their ranged squishies is indeed a great way to get killed.

That circle will activate immediately on cast.  So, you aim to hit them with that part unless you want to block off an escape or block someone in. Sadly, this does make you get closer, but rarely do I really feel like I'm in danger getting that close for such a short time unless I have several teammates behind me in a bottle neck where I wouldn't be able to back out after casting.   edit: spelling iz hard"
NexusNewbies,3d0smy,JeepCrew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"Ughh. I didn't realize this. I thought the inner circle meant that more damage would be dealt to the hero, kind of like Brightwing's inner circle.   This is really good to know, and super helpful!"

NexusNewbies,3d0smy,randplaty,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:08 2015 UTC,"Elune's Grace works wonders on the ability to land roots, at least for me it did. Also, you need to kinda place it ahead of where the person is going. It is slow proc and if you drop it right on top of someone, it will usually be moved out of unless they're stunlocked into it. You can also put the mini circle down on someone to guarantee they're instantly locked down as it procs faster than the root circle does. I also will give the advice someone gave me on Nazeebo's walls. Sometimes using them for zoning is enough. You don't need to ""hit"" every time to have it be successful. If they move around to dodge your roots and run into something like a maw, a phoenix, or something else nasty, your roots did their job."

You should have the highest or second highest on the team depending on your teams comp. That being said it's really not a good indicator on whether you are actually playing well or not."
NexusNewbies,3czif0,QuinnOfLegends,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:01:26 2015 UTC,"Can't always compare those numbers straight across the board either.  KT is going to do more hero damage because he is going to poke from 16 on.  He is going to do aoe damage to enemies.  Kerrigan isn't like that.  She will jump in on a target and try to take that one target out of the game.  She might get more than 1 hero in her combo but she will knock then one person out and then back out until she can do it again.  Meanwhile Kt is poking away at range.  Both types of damage have their role to play.  On top of that, Kerrigan can't go in instantly.  You have to wait for the right moment to make your dive, usually a window opened by range/tank damage and them overextending a little."
NexusNewbies,3czif0,iwearatophat,2,Sun Jul 12 06:54:33 2015 UTC,"This! There are the damage assassins (KT, Valla, Jaina, Raynor,...) and the takedown assassins (Nova, Zeratul, Kerrigan off the top of my head - perhaps Butcher and Illidan?). Sure, you can and will take down people with the first type and damage-poke with the latter. And the borders are more of a gradient than a line, but it's zhe general idea. This distinction is essential when judging how well you did.  The damage assassins should be leading hero damage. That is a quite solid rule. The takedown assassins don't really have stats to prove their worth. Sure, Zera can lead the hero damage if he has to be aggressive, but him doing so is a sign that the team is not doing very good - his job is to take out squishies and damaged foes. He won't do high damage numbers over time to achieve that.  If there is any stat you might wan't to consider valueing in takedown assassins' it's the your to team takedown ratio. I always feel bad about my Zeratul if I didn't participate in at least 75% of the takedowns. Don't know if you have to be so harsh with yourself with Kerrigan. She has quite a different package to obtain her kills."

Two things are important with Kerrigan :    ability to take down a hero that would otherwise escape (so it's basically the number of combos you manage to land where the hero(es) happen(s) to die). Ability to enter the fight at the right moment. You need to be able to eliminate a DPS hero quickly (Kael, Jaina...) and not die.    The greatest Kerrigan ability is her combo, which basically dooms the heroes when landed but doesn't deal that much damages so it won't appear in the stats.   Basically, don't focus on the stats and gank those motherfuckers to death."

NexusNewbies,3cxtyf,Hawly,10,Sat Jul 11 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"I bought all 3.  My opinion:  Nexus: Has a ton of value, but a lot of it is skins and mounts.  Not to say the heroes aren't good at all, of course, but there's a lot of 2k/4k heroes included that would be easier picked up with gold or when they go on sale.  Also, it's worth noting that every time I'm roller derby Nova in a solo QM, I end up getting BMed a lot in chat by my team.   It's great to add to your collection if you don't already have the heroes and it gives you some great skins/mounts, but I'd pick this one up only if you have the contents of the other bundles.    Retail Starter: So much value.  Jaina is worth half of the pack by herself.  Throw in the bonus Zeratul to give away if your friend wanted one (enter the skin before the hero and you get him for free) and you've got a pretty solid deal.  The hearthstone cards were nice, but I pulled 40 dust so I wouldn't bank on it being special in any way.  A bit annoying to activate (on blizzard's page one by one with 25-digit codes) but still worth it.  In-game Starter Bundle: The stimpack alone pays for the bundle.  The fact that they add time means you don't have to factor in timing when buying it.  Really, you're looking at 3 free heroes with the purchase of a stim on this one.  TL;DR: Retail starter and in-game starter are crazy worth it.  Nexus is iffy and would probably be the last one I'd recommend picking up, especially to a newer player."
NexusNewbies,3cxtyf,EraserParticles,2,Sat Jul 11 19:32:14 2015 UTC,Holy moly! Thanks a lot for the answer! I 'll pick up the retail and the in-game Starter packs then!
NexusNewbies,3cxtyf,EraserParticles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"No problem. Remember it's just my opinion and actual value will vary depending on which heroes you end up liking. If you like Nova and hate the stuff that comes in the other starters, it makes Nexus more valuable than the others. I'd recommend grabbing the $5 bundle and going from there.  Since the retail is available at GameStop, if you want even more value you can trade in some old games to pick it up. I was able to get like, $30 or something from some stuff I had already picked up on steam's summer sale."

I actually stopped using her just because people have unrealistic expectations when I play her. Like, no matter how well I'm doing they expect me to be everywhere at once and leading hero damage while soaking a lane solo vs two others.  Which is a shame because Nova is really growing on me as I'm delving into the lore and trying out different fun builds for her.

NexusNewbies,3cxbym,mcandre,2,Sat Jul 11 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"How does one effectively jump camera to allied heroes? Is there a hotkey to jump the camera to allies or do Abathur players usually use the mouse on the mini-map?   Minimap.  Hide in bushes in lanes so that your locusts spawn closer to minion waves. Staying next to Forts or Towers while your minions are pushed to the other side of the lane leads to locusts timing out before actually reaching the minion wave and dealing any kind of damage. The closer you are to the wave, the more damage your locusts are able to do.  Also, place lots and lots of mines whenever they're available. Not only do they deal damage, but they're also wards. You can place them in bushes near entrances to jungles or other lanes. Place them around shrines or any objectives like merc camps or bosses so you know if and when they take it. (or if anyone is about to gank your lane). They also reveal cloak so if a Zeratul or Nova steps on one, they're cloak will disable."

There's a lot of technical advice that is super helpful (the importance of soaking XP, pinging and talking a lot to avoid suicidal overcommitment being my two favs), but the biggest advice I can give is always play a good psychological game no matter the current state of the match.   People sometimes like to ""gg"" at the 8 minute mark, accuse people of never helping, etc. But I have been in so many games where it all turns around at the last minute.  As a great captain once said: ""Never give up, never surrender!""  Drink the salty tears of your enemy, and dilute your own teams' with the Gatorade of positivity!"

Best I had so far was, two people called the rest of us in group newbs (we were but still...), they then proceeded to rage quit and left match, letting the AI take over... and then despite being 3 levels behind the opposition (with multiple lanes penetrated fairly deeply on our side), we managed to wipe their entire team, shifting the balance back to almost even, and followed through after that for a win... only thing that would have been sweeter, is if those rage quitters could have realized that the AI was playing their toons better than them..."

NexusNewbies,3cwvb2,SirMuzzadder,3,Sat Jul 11 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"In HOTS, objectives are far more important than laning. Group up, steal camps, collect shrines/seeds/coins/skulls/tributes as the map dictates, win team fights, and the game's easy.  Try to solo lane, and while the stat screen will appear to show you as the greatest xp/siege damage contributor, you'll actually be hurting the team strategically.  Conversely, leaving a lane open early game is a great way to lose xp. Don't push too far without your team, just soak up xp and help team get objectives as they come up until level 10.  When your team is winning, grab all camps, then push the same lane together.  When your team is losing, defend the most threatening lanes, then once you have protective minion waves, clear camps. Clearing camps helps your team catch up in levels, and unlike DOTA or LoL, camps actually fight for your team alongside your minions.  Accrue gold quickly by completing daily quests and by leveling up free week heroes to 5."

Anub'arak is an excellent offtank (he can solo tank too though).  Rehgar, Malfurion, and Uther and the best supports. Rehgar is probably the best overall, but uther is good to counter burst damage and malf is good to counter sustained damage.  Any one of those heroes is excellent. Don't be put off because I listed Sylv and KT after Zera and Jaina, they're all totally viable. If you want a ranged nuker, get Jaina, melee nuker get Zera.  Yes, it's probably dumb to just blow your 10k gold when you have such a small hero pool. You need at least 10 heroes to enter hero league, so work on that first imo.

NexusNewbies,3cubz1,SchAmToo,0,Fri Jul 10 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching the video when you didn't include overload in the level 1 talents.

The range is obviously really nice, but i feel the mana regen per hit is pretty good too.  I mean minion waves are 7 and it's easy to hit all 7, so that's 49 mana per cast.  With 2nd strike that's up to 98 mana every cooldown.  Really let's you spam Q and W.   Maybe the mana regen is better for newbies like me who are still learning how to be more efficient with mana vs. just spamming storms everywhere.  Range is obviously stronger the better your opponents get.  At low levels you don't have to be as wary because the opponents aren't as coordinated for wombo ganks and the like, that the extra range helps you avoid."
NexusNewbies,3csjvd,orangeway69,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"As long as his ult is what it is, he will always be competitive. It's just that strong. Even ignoring that he's a strong hero. Lots of damage, easy to escape with, and stealth. A good Zeratul can absolutely wreak havoc against a team that doesn't protect its squishies properly, and that's not even mentioning the poor Abathurs."
NexusNewbies,3csjvd,Retskcaj19,3,Fri Jul 10 13:59:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  So long as he has wormhole and enough burst to force an enemy hero to play incredibly passive, not necessarily kill them just basically force them out of a team fight until they get heals, along with that ult he will be a strong pick.  You will need to put in practice though.  Zeratul is not an easy hero to play.  You really need to know when to go in and when not to.  Wormhole is strong but if you go in only to get stunned you are screwed.  The difference between a good and bad Zeratul is only beaten out by Illidan."

Zera is one of my favorite heroes to play, but just be aware of your team comp before picking him in HL. Since he (generally) roams you're going to want to make sure that the rest of your team is going to be able to hold lanes while you do your thing. He can be a dangerous pick on maps like dragon shire if you don't know what you're doing, but if you put in enough practice, you can really turn the tides of a battle.   Similar to nova, a good zeratul is a curse to the enemy team, but a bad zera is a curse to his own team."

NexusNewbies,3cs6yp,Eriennyl,2,Fri Jul 10 10:19:48 2015 UTC,"Valla is probably the hardest to stutter step, since her attack speed is high and then gets higher if you take the right talents. It's definitely a rhythm thing. Maybe practice with a slower character, but definitely practice in Try mode should be decent. Otherwise, you're doing it right."

NexusNewbies,3cs6yp,Sreyz,2,Sat Jul 11 03:49:07 2015 UTC,"Stutter stepping isn't really the most important thing to learn for Valla. There is a giantantic list of skills to pick up before stutter stepping comes to play; positioning, decision making, map awareness, target selection. And I think if you have master of of those things by then you should be quite mechanically fluid that stutter-stepping isn't a far reach. But honestly in the beginning it don't matter all that much"
NexusNewbies,3cs6yp,snowpuppii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"I think you know the basics already, so I'll tell you this.   The most important thing about stutter stepping is knowing how fast you attack. Go to some minions, attack them and take a mental note of how long the intervals are between each attack is.   Now you attack, move immediately after attacking, and while you do that, count or wait the time you counted between your attacks, then attack again, and repeat.   Of course you're not going to do it perfectly every time, but it's still gonna be worth it.   Hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm not a native speaker and for me it's kind of difficult to explain"

NexusNewbies,3cqcn2,WhiteStripesWS6,4,Thu Jul 9 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"Basically after lvl 10 it's better to stick together as a team, and it becomes more and more important when the game gets longer. Two things tho :   Minions xp is still important, so if you can clean quickly a big wave, please do so. Getting xp is never a bad thing. Sometimes it's more useful to split a bit. You don't need to be 4 to get a siege camp or to secure a temple when half the enemies are dead. During these moments split to get some xp / more creep or to gank someone really out of position. But always group before engaging a teamfight.   After lvl 16-20, being alone means that you are dead."
NexusNewbies,3cqcn2,henrax,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:57:21 2015 UTC,"Also,  keeping the lanes pushed gives vision and adds to your ability to track the opponent on the map.  It also means that your towers aren't taking free damage."
NexusNewbies,3cqcn2,levinho,3,Mon Jul 13 07:27:05 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this question a lot recently and have come to the conclusion that the mid and late game  (post level 10) can't be summed up with a rule like ""everyone stick together"" because, let's face it, creep waves/mercs/bosses sent against you still need to be cleared, objectives chased and it's just not practical that everyone stays together. In fact, if you try to have everyone stick together you will fall behind.  So, what do you do? Well, that highly depends on what your opponent is doing. Are they on top of camps and threatening with a boss? Are they running around with very little direction? Are they pushing or split pushing your gates? As a team you need to know the answer.  So what's the answer? Be observant. Watch the mini map. This will not only give you clues as to when the enemy is up to but hopefully you'll be more aware when a teammate might need a little help to evade a gank or engage a lone enemy.  Ultimately, the mid/late game is won through map control and teamwork, flexibility and adaptability, distraction and anticipation.   Good question!"
NexusNewbies,3cqcn2,nightshiftb,3,Fri Jul 10 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"There's no cut and dry rule for this. You're gonna have to evaluate the situation yourself before you make the decision to roll together or to go separate ways and do different things. One thing to keep in mind: always make sure that you have a numbers advantage when a fight might break out. If the opponents are pushing with 4 in bot lane, and their Azmodan is top, it is best to send all five of your team members to beat. You will probably win the fight bot. If the enemy team is split up, then you have to decide whether you want to try and get a pick on one of their players as a five man team, or you want to split up and soak some EXP/take mercs/clear lanes. In that situation, you have to adapt. That's what separates good players from great ones!"
NexusNewbies,3cqcn2,MrRoadApples,3,Fri Jul 10 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with the comments by nightshifttb and henrax. Very good advice.     My personal general rule: * Mid game is when at least one team has reached level 10 and the respawn timer is around 30s or more. * Late game is when at least one team has reached level 16 and the respawn timer is more than 45s. The rule about ""roll as a team when 10"" comes from the fact that when respawn timers get higher, every death is really and I mean really BAD. Also heroes start giving pretty decent XP so you might not wish to give that advantage to the opposing team by going yolo and dying. :D     Minion XP > all other sources as it also scales very well and so the important questions seem to be: * Are the minion waves pushing into enemy forts or past them? If yes, do something else with your team. * Can you reliably and safely soak XP from there? If not, do something else with your team. * Are you clearly missing out on XP due to empty lanes and the opposing team populating more lanes? If you are, then you should consider point #2 again. You'll need that XP.       Camps: * Is the map objective up? If it is, don't go soloing camps. No. If the team decides to do camps during the objective, support them and get it done faster. Even bad team decisions are better than good solo decisions. * Is the map objective about to come up? If it is and you know it, and your hero can reliably take down camps without taking a huge hit in resources such as health&mana, ping for assistance and go for it. Taking camps right before the objective is up is a very effective strategy. * Are heroes of the opposing team unaccounted for? If you don't know where they all are then be very careful, because they just might be at the camp you roam into even if it is in your side of the map. You don't want a 1v3 situation going into a camp since quite frankly, that's when you are most likely pretty relaxed and looking around the map while moving your hero towards the camp. * Is your team doing camps and lanes are left empty with opposing team heroes in lanes? This is a huge thing that many players miss. You really need the XP from lanes and camps do not give as much XP as a minion wave. You have two options here: 1. Swoop down really fast and get the camp done quicker, but only if you are close in the first place. 2. Go to a lane with the most opposing minions alive and get XP.       Objectives: * Has your team decided to skip an objective for any reason? Respect that decision and do your best to support it. Get XP, do camps, do boss.. work with your team. Be very careful for when the opposing team has captured/finished the objective. They have grouped and will likely move as a group for at least a minute or so. Veritable death squad right there. Do NOT overextend even during objectives, unless you are very mindful of the situation and your minimap! * Is your team going to contest the objective? GO GO GO! No! Wait! Approach the objective with consideration. Don't just charge in alone (disclaimer: There are situations where you should do exactly that, but as a general rule stay safe.). Your team will benefit more from going in as a team and doing what you can, together, than going in as a feeding trickle for the opponents to pick out one by one. Even if you lose the objective because your team is slow, dying during the mid and especially the late game is not the answer. Obviously there are situations where sacrifices have to be made, but that's another post."

NexusNewbies,3crm9a,NFLfan2539,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:24:50 2015 UTC,If you have a lead you can easily win with a good engage. Then her split pushing is so much more significant.
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,ReKaYaKeR,6,Fri Jul 10 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas solo pushing is just one of many strategies, and it has a counter.  Shut her down.  Sure she's good at solo pushing, and she can hold her own 1v1, but she's not invincible, and any number of heroes can easily chase her away.  Especially considering you have the advantage of attacking from your own base, meaning if you take damage you can use the healing fountain.  Show her early that she can't solo push, and keep tabs on her, and you'll be fine.  Sylvanas isn't the only hero who can solo push really effectively.  Zagara, Gazlowe, Sgt. Hammer, and Nazeebo can all solo push really effectively as well.  It's just a strategy that you have to learn to counter."

That talent to take less damage from minions + whirlwind + not having to worry about running out of mana made for some slow but effective tower-smashing."
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,MaritMonkey,4,Fri Jul 10 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"HotS, at least in my opinion, is about objectives, and grouping as a team to get them   Yes, but not all the time. Sometimes there's more value in applying pressure in a second lane and forcing the enemy team to send 2 which gives your team an advantage on a single objective. You seemed to figure this out in your post - that there are alternative strategies to having everyone jump into a giant melee all the time.  Have you played against other specialists? They do similar things.   Sylvanas is a great character and absolutely contributes to team fights especially with her ult."
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,Razzl,3,Fri Jul 10 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"Some heroes are way better at splitpushing. Murky and Azmodan can wreck your base all by themselves and they are way better in 1v1 than Sylv (but their escape is not as good, especially Azmo). Zagara is also better than Sylv if alone imo.  Sylv is not that good at splipushing. She can be contained farily easily and you should win teamfights without a scratch. But she is lethal when with her team, she adds a lot in teamfights and pushing with a Sylv is way easier (especially on Mines), but if you gank her you should be able to kill her quickly (stun her when she has already sent her E)."
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,henrax,3,Fri Jul 10 08:16:11 2015 UTC,"HotS, at least in my opinion, is about objectives   Nah. It's about destroying their core. Objectives are one of the major design methods of accomplishing that, but if it were the only way of accomplishing that then there wouldn't even be a need for a core. One of the things that makes the game interesting is that you have to balance between objectives, killing opponents, pushing lanes/XP, activating mercs, etc. Knowing at what times what are the benefits and costs of each decision is where we always work to improve ourselves.   she can still win the duel   You shouldn't let her win a duel. You should drive her away from being able to lock down your defenses. Never go in thinking ""we'll fight until one of us dies"". If you can't kill her off, then at least keep enough pressure on her that your minions can fight their minions and that your towers can defend too.   She just went to an uncontested lane   Here's where your team needs to recognize when to split one off and harass her. If you're 5v4 or 3v2 or whatever on a temple then you should eventually completely drive away your opponents. At that point, you don't need all 5 or 3 sitting on the Temples. Only one needs it (whoever has enough to fight off the guardians) and the rest can move off and do other things.  To answer your title, Sylvanas is in the game just like Azmodan or Gazlowe or Abathur or whoever. They mix up the standard way of fighting and force different strategies and variety."
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,N8CCRG,2,Fri Jul 10 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"No, no she can't. As someone who plays Sylvanas and Zagara a ton, I will just say that split pushing and ignoring your team is the last thing you want to do. There are times to split push, but if a team fight breaks out, you better get your butt there. There is nothing ""winnable"" about sacrificing your whole team so you can take down a free keep. For one, the xp for a nearly full team wipe is way more than a keep, especially lategame. Also, most people know better than to let Sylvanas, Zagara, Gazlowe, or other specialists freepush. They will gank you, they will farm you, and they will get the lead and win because of it if anyone of their team has half a brain. She's squishy and most Sylvanas's that lane and split push over everything else usually do not know how to use their banshees to juke to safety.   If that Sylvanas won the game by mostly solo pushing, she won the lottery. In almost every game I usually am in, I get focus fire even if I have my whole team beside me to push. If I go off on my own I better be ready to fight or run before they start popping up. Similar to the promote split push strategy, especially now that it got nerfed/changed, most specialists and split pushing strategies punish those who lack map awareness and don't occasionally go to clear out minion buildup or specialist pushes. Most specialists have tools that make them able to siege comfortably. Blizzard has nerfed split push related things a few times, so it's a lot harder than it once was and there are a lot of ways to shut down people trying it now. It's a risk/reward strategy.   Sorry if I got a little meh in this response. As a specialist, lover I hate specialists who selfishly abandon their team and everything else just to lane and destroy things. They get top siege and they win sometimes so they think they're doing good things when really they're handicapping their team. There is never a reason to ignore every objective on a map, and you should only let them go if your team agrees to for one reason or another (mercs, deaths, get boss instead, etc). As for split pushing specialists? Send two or three members down for a quick gank. I almost guarantee you the player will be alone nine times out of ten, make sure one of the characters has a stun or some hard cc so Sylvanas can't banshee to escape or trade out a death and destroy her. It's very easy for a split pusher to overstay their welcome, which is another reason it's a more advanced strategy."
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,dreamslave,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:47:00 2015 UTC,"I've only played a couple games with Slyvanas, as far as I can tell, she is there to assist in small aoe cone attacks and mainly doing siege  damage, is that how you are supposed to play her?"
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,michaelzelen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:07:09 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas is a specialist and all of them do aide in sieging and map control. She is very high damage and her trait shutting down towers can be very powerful. At the same time, like all other specialists, there is a time and place for split pushing. You usually want to join your team as Sylvanas when action starts happening. Nobody wants to be in a teamfight a man down without warning and her damage and her silencing ult can really sway a teamfight. Most of them will expect you to know when to go to a teamfight and when to stay and take a fort. Communicate your intentions to your team and make sure you know when to cut your losses. If you're off in a lane alone while your team is elsewhere and you don't see half or all of the enemy team on the minimap, assume they're coming right for you and get out of there immediately. Your death is usually not worth a fort or a keep or what have you, neither is a teamwipe. Her banshees, with their teleport, are usually used to escape danger and/or chase down enemies on occasion moreso than damage. I hope this helped you out. :)"

NexusNewbies,3crm9a,Sparkii220,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:43:56 2015 UTC,"So which champions are good at shutting down a split pushing specialist 1v1? She could run from some ranged assassins before they do significant damage, so I'd imagine maybe Illidan/Zeratul/Nova? Maybe Jaina and Thrall as well? Any more?"
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,cathartis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:45:27 2015 UTC,"Most assassins, preferrably melee. Zeratul, Illidan, and Kerrigan can all take her out if they get the jump on her, especially the latter. Characters with stuns also, I've seen Muradin take out Sylvanas pretty easily. I personally struggle wtih Tychus when I'm on Sylvanas. It's really down to who outplays who and whose abilities are on cd in that vs. Jaina, similar to Tychus can go toe to toe with Sylvanas as well, especially with the slow. Tyrael and Anub'arak also can be a pain for Sylv if they land their stuns.   Zagara is easier. She doesn't have an out and she relies on her creep for vision and healing and movement speed. If you can sneak behind her and take out her creep and flank her, she's done for. Ranged assassins can trade with her if they watch for her hydralisk and other minions. You want to fight her on your terms, not hers.  Azmodan has a huuuuuuge health pool and can be a pest, but he suffers from Zagara's lack of escapes. Ranged can kite him down, especially if they have aoe for his minion spawns. Melee usually suffers from being easily in his death lazer range so you either want to jump him with low mana or have an ability like Illidan's dive ready to hop away and reengage after it's broken. Depending on his build, his globes could be lethal. Early game it's easy to take the hit but late game avoid at all costs as it stacks for everything it kills and by then can hit for up to 1000 damage or more.  Gazlowe is tough. Fighting under his turrets is usually what gets people killed, but those things are high range and definitely pretty tough to take out. Similar to Zagara, you don't want him on his turf (the turrets). He's pretty slow as are his abilities so hit and run or extra slows and high damage can give him a bad day.  Hammer's really easy. If she's sieged, sneak around, cc, then blow her up. She's extremely susceptible to burst. Watch the mines and try not to aa trade with her since her autoattack is the highest in the game (so don't send Raynor or AA Valla after her).   Murky is pretty easy to nullify but at the same time you want to be careful. Kill his pufferfish before it explodes to negate most of his damage. If you're an assassin, either don't go alone or be careful to avoid the Pufferfish/Octograb combo. If he Puffer/Octo's an ally, you can usually burst HIM down as it stuns him as well.   For Nazeebo be careful of his poison and zombie walls if you don't have a way out of them. The more he hits you, the more stacked damage you're going to take. Usually best to stunlock or burst him before he can do too much counterdamage.  I hope this helped a little. It's not the entire guide to how to stop them but it's tips I've found personally from playing these characters or against them that works."
NexusNewbies,3crm9a,dreamslave,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"If you send 2 against her, you're pulling too much away from objectives to actually secure the objective. ESPECIALLY on mines.   I don't often see people have success playing Sylvanas that way on Mines. I main Sylvanas and every single time mines open (if we have pushed past the entrance and enter first) I'll go in and clear most of the groups and almost half the skulls.  I think you were right on that kneejerk reaction bit. Moderately talented players never allow Sylvanas to go uncontested. It's definitely a major no-no. She's best when she helps win a teamfight and leads a push during their respawn."
NexusNewbies,3cr281,anathelia,6,Fri Jul 10 02:20:37 2015 UTC,"You have it a bit backwards lol, you should aim to win, not to improve your MMR. Don't worry about MMR for now. Here's a tip I think is pretty useful for beginners. Your number one priority should be to not die. It isn't to call the correct shots, it's not to do the most poke damage. It's simply just to not die. Also, don't play Li-li. Her abilities are deceptively simple, but she can be difficult to play for new players because she has no cc/escape. Also, just play for fun! Being stressed about losing from the moment the match starts will not help you win, and you will have less fun regardless of the outcome."
NexusNewbies,3cr281,MrRoadApples,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:27:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I phrased it kind of weird. I was (apparently mistakenly) under the impression that, as my MMR dropped, I was going to be teamed with worse and worse players. The other night, my husband and I were teamed with some Brazilians which was difficult because we couldn't communicate and also because my experience in gaming with them is that they are notoriously stubborn and not always the greatest at doing what they're supposed to.  So I was assuming that if I couldn't win, and therefore improve my MMR, then I was never going to be able to win. I feel like I've got a DECENT grasp on Li-Li, I've gotten pretty good at being evasive, but I'm going to give her a break and try someone else for awhile. I did moderately with Tyrande in AI matches during her free week so I may pick her up and try and get better at her.  I'm terrible at melee (body blocking makes me mad...lol) so if there are any newbie-friendly ranged guys (I already own Raynor) that you, or anyone really, suggests, I'm all ears!"
NexusNewbies,3cr281,tundranocaps,3,Fri Jul 10 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"As your MMR drops you will be placed with worse and worse players. You'll also get faced against worse and worse players. So your chances of winning will not go down. You're supposed to be in a game that's mostly balanced with close to 50% win-rate as it starts (with one side favoured, MMR is often about predicting who will win).  Your chances of winning don't go down as your MMR goes down, but the player quality will.  Newbie friendly ranged heroes, hmmm. I'd recommend trying Malfurion, he's a healer, and ranged, and better than Li Li, I'd say. Valla can be pretty simple, and go for an auto-attack-based build that's reminiscent of a less tanky Raynor, but can also go for different, ability-based builds. In general, most of the easier gameplay characters are melee warriors.  Tyrande is all about hitting skillshots, where real players behave quite differently than AI opponents."
NexusNewbies,3cr281,MrRoadApples,2,Fri Jul 10 05:47:40 2015 UTC,"Yikes, it's always rough getting players that don't speak the same language. Apparently over in the Europe, the Russians are the worst to play with lol. Playing melee heroes does require a certain mindset that a lot of people don't have at first. As for hero suggestions, have you tried Valla? She's got good damage and is pretty easy to pick up. She's also really cheap. As for more in game tips, as a ranged hero, you generally want to stay in the back line of your team. Even if you are an assassin, giving up your position to get a kill is usually not worth it. As a healer, this means that you should always be in the safest position possible, but still in range to heal your team."

One tip, especially with lower level players, is 5 people doing something stupid is better than 2 people doing something smart.  If you are playing with your husband, there is no reason you should lose, that is already 2/5 players on your team working together.  Playing Li-Li will probably make it harder to ensure the win as well, because you will depend on other players making plays.  If you pick someone who can get kills combined with your husband that will probably make it easier.  Hope this helps!"

I would be inclined to think maybe there is something you are overlooking on your gameplay and your strategy if your MMR is so low.   I'm a pretty below average player, but I get a 50/50 win rate and track my stats per game to see how my various damage types/exp/healing/tanking etc compare to others.

I think playing against the A.I. to get into the groove with whoever you're queueing with is a great idea. Let's you work out an easy game and get rolling, warmed up.  20% win rate is slightly ridiculous. However, if you're rated that way with MMR your opponents are also in that same skill bracket. What's the other team doing better than you? Have you been using chat?  I find that when I get into a game and say Hello everyone, gl hf! The team is much more talkative. You get a lot more map pings out of people, more map awareness, etc. You get a group of people playing together rather than running in their own little bubble.  There are plenty of things to work on, and whenever I have a loss I try and watch the replay to examine what I did wrong, what I did right and what I could have done better. Watching that minimap is key! When you get chameleon eyes going and can watch that and the main screen at the same time you start to reach another plateau of play."
NexusNewbies,3cr281,puttybutty,3,Sun Jul 12 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"When it's that amount of losses, and the only constant is you and your husband, it's pretty clear that your mmr reflects your skill level. Just keep practicing. :)"

Also... if you have more health or can take more damage... try to body block to help a teammate flee. These two concepts really helped me grow."

NexusNewbies,3cr281,LeeDanbo,2,Fri Jul 10 05:43:28 2015 UTC,Here's what I do. I pick Abathur and AFK help the team by sitting in the base being useful.
NexusNewbies,3cr281,apocalyptic,6,Fri Jul 10 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"No but in all seriousness, I pick Abathur, place mines in bushes that you can tunnel to. Tunnel into a bush and just be a Locust Nest. Grab Talents like: At Level 1, I grab shield all nearby merc and minions, and the ""shield lasts even after symbiote ends"" talent, then I grab most of the locust talents. Locust Ranged attack, the spawn locust active (spawns 3), then take the Spawn Locust Nest that spawns locusts every couple ten seconds. Take your Monstrosity ult.  How to play: Stay in lanes, hide in your bushes and spawn locusts. Since enemies can guess where you are depending on where your locusts come from, tunnel into a bush (need vision. You have Mines to give you vision) and spawn locusts by sitting in there. I also give hat to minions and just stab waves constantly. Soak all the exp and deal siege damage to push faster. When you minion wave gets to the enemy towers, just keep stabbing. When an enemy comes to defend, B out and tunnel to a different lane. Just keep applying pressure in different lanes. Once you have a monstrosity, let him soak minion deaths so that he can get 30 stacks. Push with Monstrosity. This is where that minion/merc heal comes in handy. When you place a shield on monstrosity, it'll not only heal the monstrosity but all the minions around you. You can almost double your minions lifespan by doing this. Spam your shield. Heal as many minions as possible. You can also 1v1 enemy heroes with Monstrosity now because you have double the sustain (shield and heal). Don't underestimate the heal. It's really good. If you feel like you're gonna die, just back up, shield once and watch your health go back up 20%. Just keep pushing lanes.  Now once you hit Lv. 20, you should have those two Locust spawning talents. Hide the nest in another bush in the same lane, get closer to your minion wave and spawn those 3 locusts and back up into a bush. That's like 5 instant locusts that deal a lot of damage. Then, you give hat to a minion, shield, and your wave should heal back up to full health.  You should be able to push all the way to their Core. With full stack monstrosity, constant waves of locusts, and your hat healing minion waves, you should be able to solo that Core. I've been able to multiple times.  If you're constantly, playing with teammates who ignore pings or don't listen, just play by yourself. Shove lanes by yourself, if a teammate comes into the lane with you, he's gonna lure enemies to get you killed. Tunnel into an abandoned lane. Avoid EVERYONE. Play by yourself."

I think some of it rests on my partner, as I did most of my winning while he was out of town and I was playing by myself, but I'm definitely no superstar at the game by a long shot.  I'll add you, thanks."
NexusNewbies,3cr281,EasyComputer,2,Fri Jul 10 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the MMR on hotslogs has no effect on your matchmaking in heroes itsself.  Just know that you can only control yourself, and you can't force your team to objectives. I find that i can get people to come with me to objectives and camps easier by pinging ""on my way"" instead of assistance or defend. It's less of an order, which people can get their backs up about, and more of an FYI.  Another thing is to really really try not to die. Especially in scenarios where you would be contesting an objective that you think you're going to lose. If you go in, die and still lose the objective then you are fairly screwed, especially on maps that reward the winning team with greater pushing power (cursed hollow, dragon shire, garden terror.. etc etc) because then you'll be needed to defend. A lot of the time knowing when to give up a fight makes all the difference.  One thing i see a lot of people try to do is control multiple objectives at once, and losing them all. On sky temple i try and encourage my team to storm one objective, knock a few people down, and then split to capture the second if we can. Even then you're sure to get at least half of the fort damage if you stack on one, when it's more than one temple.  The same kind of thing applies on cursed hollow. If you're at 2/3 and your enemy is at 0 or 1/3, if you're not set up well on the map for the fight, you might be able to capitalise on knowing roughly where the enemy is going to be, and take a few camps or the boss instead, and regroup for the next one.  Trying to stay clear headed is really key to making the right decisions. And if you can identify what you should be doing at a given point in the game then you're going to be fine. Obviously you get games where trying to get you're teammates to get to the right play is going to be impossible, but if you can identify what needs to be done and try to encourage you're team in that direction then it will work wonders when you have teamwork on top of that.  I'm a fairly rubbish player, and my MMR on hotslogs is fairly awful, but that's just what i've picked up after a month or two of playing."
NexusNewbies,3cr281,EasyComputer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I'll try using that ping instead and see how it works out. I think I'm getting okay at not dying while still being involved in team fights. It's definitely frustrating to watch my teammates not pull back when we're going to be involved in an uneven team fight or are about to die. I'm going to try and take a more active role damage wise for awhile and see if that changes anything.  Up until this point, I thought I would best help my team by being a support and allowing them to stay alive, but since that doesn't seem to be working out for them or for me, it sounds like it's time for me to take what I have learned from having a less offensive role in matches and apply it to a damage role."

Great visuals and explanations on why you chose the build.  The only thing that I would suggest for newbies to this character is describing the other options for talents, and why this one is more useful than the other, similar to what you did for the level 16 talent. If there's a talent in a tier that is an obvious choice, it'd be great to quickly explain why for completely new beginners to the character.  I'm a relatively new beginner in the aspect that I haven't played Diablo yet, so just some tips on what I'd like to see!  Other than that I have learned a lot from this, and will definitely try it out in a few QMs!"
NexusNewbies,3cpfp6,Skaitavia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!

His chain heal and earthbind totem (slowing ward) are pretty awesome."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,awwnuts07,2,Thu Jul 9 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"sorry, soak?"
NexusNewbies,3coky8,zer05tar,3,Thu Jul 9 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"Standing near minion waves as they fight and clearing them. Killing minions or just being near them when they die grants experience, so for at least the first part of the game it is paramount that someone is near each minion death so your time gets maximum experience. Soaking is the casual term because you're ""soaking up"" the experience like a sponge by being present."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,Xaliver,3,Thu Jul 9 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"In HotS, soaking is when you get xp by being near enemy minions when they die. The general consensus, that I've seen, is that the distance you need to be within is about 75% of your screen.   So let's say a team fight just ended.  After everyone scatters/retreats/whatever, look at the mini map.  If there's no teammate that needs help that you can assist or no objectives you can grab solo (there are more situations, just giving 2 examples), head to the nearest lane without an ally hero in it and clear minions/hide in bushes/smoke near them.  You get the full amount of xp just being near them.   TL;DR: Soaking is being near enemy minions when they are killed. You get the full amount of xp just being near them, hitting or not. So you are ""soaking"" up the xp."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,JeepCrew,2,Thu Jul 9 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"Actually in League of Legends, you get EXP just by being near minions, too. It's gold that you lose out on when you don't last hit minions."

NexusNewbies,3coky8,JeepCrew,2,Thu Jul 9 23:43:00 2015 UTC,I love that this Heroes algorithm is floating around now! I think we should try and pool in to make a graphical flow chart guide of the game. That might be really useful. I've written an incredibly crude one out on a notepad.
NexusNewbies,3coky8,Ouzelum92,2,Thu Jul 9 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"I also like Malfurion's E ability (1.5 second root in a growing AOE circle). He may not do much damage but good lord can he heal when built properly (esp with the AOE ult heal that can pretty much take a team of almost deads back to near full health).  EDIT: oh man if people followed the last two instead of:   if [enemy team] position = unknown Do [merc camp]   I swear my team always wants to go for the boss right at Lv10 and then get surrounded and just like that, boss steal."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,creamcityjw,4,Thu Jul 9 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"There's already wonderful advice here already, I just wanted to add some more. The laning phase in this game and games in general are a lot shorter than other mobas. Games can be 15-30 minutes on average with 10 or 40 minute matches being on the rare side. Usually you want to lane until 10 then start working together more with your team, unless you're behind or minions are being pushed/building up then you want to soak/clear minions safely.   Since you said you like supports and I like supports I'll add some support specific stuff. There aren't many supports in game, but they all play differently. Lili is a bit of a starter support. I do like her, she's a darling, but her nontargetable heals can sometimes be a bit tough especially in very rough matches. Regardless, as a starting point she's more than solid and I do still love pulling her out on occasion. As for the others:   Malfurion-Like Lili, he's pretty straightforward. His heal is a heal over time that can really help out in a pinch. He also has an aoe heal ult like Lili's cups, though unlike Lili he can still cast abilities while using it. His cc ability roots enemies in place and can secure kills nicely. If you like Lili's playstyle, I reccomend trying out Malfurion next if you are going for more supports. He's cheap to get and it will be an easy hop. Brightwing-This cute little faerie dragon just got a lot of changes, but she's always been a bit of a hybrid character. She's very versatile and while offering heals, she also offers a lot of strong cc. She has a powerful silence in polymorph that can completely nullify dangerous enemies. She heals through her trait by being near her allies, and her ability to phase shift from one ally to the next gives her global prescence. You can easily be on one side of the map and hop to the other to save someone who needs help. People are still trying her out and her place post-changes, but she certainly is still a strong pick for both healing and utility. I will warn that she has a bit of a learning curve though. I wouldn't hop from her from Lili unless you really are feeling brave (she was my first healer buy and I don't regret it but I had a lot of trial and error before I mastered her). Rehgar is a pretty fierce melee healer. He has a chain heal, a damaging shield, and a slowing cc totem. His healing ult can literally take an ally from a sliver of health to full hp. Ancestral healing is so powerful. Rehgar can go into wolf form and run around in a blink, which makes him highly mobile and slippery to take down in a fight. I like to call him the aggressive healing character, because he can easily heal a lot of damage and dish out some of his own at the right time and place. Some people really like speccing him for damage, especially if you roll double support, but I have still been able to go toe to toe with people going full support Rehgar when people underestimate me. Uther-Here's our kinda tanky/resilient support. Uther, like Rehgar, is melee. He's a lot less mobile but a lot more durable. He offers two burst heals (one that is linear and doubles as a heal/damage split) and a stun. When Uther dies, he can spam heal his allies and definitely punish teams that want to focus down the healer first. His two ults are either an aoe stun or a targetable spell that makes one ally completely invulnerable for a few seconds. Tyrande is a quirky support. Her heal is so-so until level 13 and she doesn't offer a lot of defensive utility. Her trait is an on demand vulnerablize for a target (increase damage on them from all sources for a time) and she has a stun to help lock down a target. Personally, I think her owl is the thing that makes her shine. You send a ghost owl out across the map and it will show you in a line vision for a few seconds for the whole map length, if it hits a hero, it damages them and you get extended vision in an area there for a little longer. You can also build these owls to be lethal, sending them off to finish off fleeing heroes with ease. This vision can be crucial to your team for decisionmaking and strategy. A lot of people see Tyrande as a supplimental support and run her with another healer for maximum efficiency. She definitely kinda straddles a line between healer and assassin with her damage output and abilities. Finally, Tassadar, who I think is the most underrated support, if not the most underrated character currently in the game. He has a powerful kit but an abysmal winrate. I would argue that out of the supports he has the highest learning curve (maybe tied with Brightwing). Tassadar is a support that offers healing through his shields. He has a shield, a weak aoe attack, and the ability to become invisible/invunlerable personally for a few seconds. One of his ults ups his damage and survivability for a short amount of time, the other gives you the ability to plant a physical wall in people's way to zone them where you desire them to go. His trait turns him into a living ward as you reveal all enemies in a certain radius every 30 seconds (15 if you take the talent!). His talents are all pretty great and you can honestly chose each one based on how the game is going so far and do well. Overall why Tassadar is tricky is because you have to have a lot of introspection. As I mentioned with the talents, to give him the best utility per match, you need to be able to say ""what do we have? what do we need?"" and to heal you need to be able to think at a moment's notice ""who is going to take damage? who needs protected most?"" Similar to Tyrande, he's often used with another support so your job is a bit more forgiving.    Right now, Tassadar and Malfurion are on the free rotation, so you may get a chance to try them out. I hope this helped you out and if you have anymore questions, feel free to ask them! :)"
NexusNewbies,3coky8,dreamslave,3,Thu Jul 9 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"As someone who also came from league, a lot of the mechanics are pretty similar.   One of the most important things to remember is that while there is no last hitting, farming does exist in the form of 'soaking' so you generally don't want to leave a lane empty for no reason.   The biggest difference is that you won't be able to carry single handedly like often times people do in LoL.  Stick with your teams and focus on objectives, your league mechanics should give you a decent advantage over newer players."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,MyNameIsKiko,3,Thu Jul 9 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"HoTs is VERY MUCH about doing the objectives, and as such learning the maps.  Cover all 3 lanes until level 10 (unless you are doing an objective) after 10ish you group up and roll as a team.  As a 'nexus newb' the #1 thing you should focus on is getting all the free heroes for the week up to lvl 5 (for an easy 500g).  Between that and just leveling up you should be able to afford some of the characters you want...  Uther is the tanky healer with good output and a nice stun  Rehgar has a 'full heal' ultimate and has great chase/escape  Malfurion has some very effective single target heals, can give people mana, has some decent control and a nice AOE ult heal  Li Li can't target her heals and I just find her boring but her AOE ult heal is amazing  Brightwing was the best support until last week when she got hit hard with the nerf bat  Tyrande and Tassadar are swiss army knives/ultility & buff support and while both are good they are not true healers (you often see Tassadar in 2 support comps)  As for other roles...  Valla is cheap, super mobile, great lane clear and easily top tier  Slyvannas is an amazing specialist/split push w/ nice burst  Zagarra is also a great specialist/split push w/ great vision  Keal Thas and Jainna are caster burst DPS/glass cannons and are both amazing at hero killing + lane clear but are not mobile  Anub Arak and Muradin are the top tier tanks and both are cheap.  EDIT: Forgot Malf."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,hiighCalibre,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:24 2015 UTC,Malfurion's ult heal > Li Li's FYI. She can't cast any abilities for the duration while his affects all heroes in the area and he can still cast.  Besides that his targeted heal (Q) has a talent that extends the duration and amplifies the heal (late-level can heal > 1000 over 10 seconds) and another talent that adds a passive which grants the effect every 20 seconds to a nearby ally. His heals are so much better when used properly.
NexusNewbies,3coky8,creamcityjw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:36:43 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I would play Malf over Li Li any day.  He's actually my support pick right now (don't own Uther yet) and while I like Rehgar I prefer to play control (I miss BW sniffle).
NexusNewbies,3coky8,hiighCalibre,3,Thu Jul 9 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"This is a copy/paste from of some important points I made in a different post, but it seems like it will help you too.  SInce you mentioned you're playing with some friends, I included some team-comp related stuff too.  1- have a 2 heroes for every role and many in your favorite role. There will be times when you'll be last pick, and need to pick up not your favorite role. For me this is warrior, but I knew how to play ETC and Diablo (and AN now) at a decent enough level. I knew all their combos, talent choices for the match ups, and an idea of how I should be positioned.  2- You need to divvy up your lanes. Will you be going for early ganks? Where do you want to apply the most pressure? Where are the easy needs/who is the best at clearing? These are all elements of What you should care about.  3- objective timers. This is the thing that seems to separate the have and have nots. On the surface, HotS is pretty random. But after some study it's just more hectic. I won't list all the timers for map objectives here as they are pretty easy to find. What I like to do is type the scoreboard clock number of the next objective spawn in chat, if someone asks me what it is I tell them. THIS IS WHAT I ATTRIBUTE THE MOST TO WINNING GAMES.  4- Identifying your 'edge'. This is a term I borrow from a magic the gathering friend of mine. Figure out what your team is good at, and play to your strengths. If your team is all burst and little sustain. Get in, do your damage, and leave. Don't stick around and try and do sustained DPS. Force the opposing team to play the game YOU want the game to be played.  5- Identifying your opponents edge. The flip side of 4. What is their team good at? What do you need to do to negate it (example: does your Uther need divine shield or divine storm?).  6- how are you going to close out the game? This is a tricky one to answer, and is often map specific.  7- analyze your replays, wins and losses. I guarantee you there will be moments (even in games you won) that you will cringe at. There will also be games that you thought you were ""so far behind, and this is hopeless"" that never were that bad."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,404clichE,2,Thu Jul 9 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"the party shares XP, so be sure each lane is soaking XP for optimal results.  hotslogs.com has metadata about games played and hero build popularity, etc.  the initial name of the game is getting heroes to level 5 to get dem gold coins.  hold off on purchasing heroes until you've played them to 5 when free.  you'll be better fitted to play heroes you ""like"" as opposed to heroes that ""are considered good"" at least until you're at 30 and ready for HL."
NexusNewbies,3coky8,arsonall,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"My first purchased hero was Lili and I loved her.  Still do, just play different heroes more now.  Solid choice for an aggressive healer.  Someone mentioned Rehgar as another healer you could try. Personally I wasn't a fan, but I didn't play him much and I see quite a few people good with him, so he is a good choice as well.   I play with 2 friends who came from LoL, 1 of which is pretty much fully converted now, and they both have had 1 big obstacle getting used to HotS over LoL: Objectives.  They keep focusing on pushes/kills/camps at the expense of fighting for/getting objectives. I'm not saying you can't win playing the game like LoL, but this is a similar type game, not the same. Objectives can save/kill you.  Team fighting and losing 2-4 teammates right before objectives pop up is a nearly sure-fire way to lose.  So pay attention to objective timers and listen for when they are announced.  Usually there is an announcement about 30 seconds before objectives become available. Be safe and prepare to take objectives during that time.  Don't over-extend and die or your team will be at a disadvantage at a critical time.   I played LoL years ago, but haven't in probably 2 or more years. Personally I went over to Smite which I still love (LOVE the controls, hate click-moving) and from there found a great site for guides. Luckily that site has a HotS section now.  It's still growing, but it's the best that I've come across: heroesfire.com. Check there for guides on your favorite heroes. Some are better than others, but read several to get different views and thoughts/playstyles."

It's not just ""choose this one because it's the best"" instead they say ""I recommend talent A in these situations because reasons... and talent B in these situations because other reasons""  You'll be able to test out other builds and compare damage/role-specific output (ie if you're a tank, some builds may allow you greater survivability and increase your damage taken stat while reducing your number of deaths).  I have never been good at tanking in MOBAs and used a Johanna build guide that maximized her siege ability but still leaves her survivability very high. It was amazing how much more fun the game was than if I had gone in blind and assumed she was a normal tank that couldn't waveclear.  TL;DR - build guides help you identify things about heroes you may have never considered."

NexusNewbies,3coky8,itsbrad123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:11:38 2015 UTC,"Basically, as good habits go, generally you want to keep control of objectives as they are semi-crucial in controlling the game, even more so than that in League. Best advice I can give you is learn your heroes but also learn the maps, as each are different and so you can learn a lot of vantage points but also where you may be lead into traps."

NexusNewbies,3coky8,Lotusx21,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"Good habits: 1. Looking at minimap every couple seconds (yes that frequently, it'll help a lot!) 2. Reflecting on your deaths 3. Being nice to your teammates 4. Note your positioning at all times, especially before a teamfight breaks out (if this means walking around a wall the long way, do it) 5. If enemies are missing, put yourself in their shoes and try to figure out where they are Bad Habits: 1. Blaming other people when you die. 2. Not soaking early game 3. Chasing people across the map/into the fog of war if enemy positions are unknown These are just some things I thought of on the fly. Feel free to add more, but I think these tips are pretty basic and can be applied immediately."

NexusNewbies,3coy12,cloral,5,Thu Jul 9 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what characters you are playing.   Some characters like Raynor stacks up high early on with hero damage, but deal no significant impact in mid-late game teamfights. However, some characters like K'T, Azmodan and Jaina have significant impact throughout the game.  It's hard to indicate what issues you have with teamfighting without replays on hand.  Here are some default statements that would just generally make you deal more damage:  1) Always attack and move if you are chasing, it allows you to get more autos in, allowing for higher burst and consistent damage output.  2) If you are playing AoE characters, it's sometimes better to deal more burst aoe damage on more targets rather than eliminating a prime threat.   3) Know the projectile speed and their way of movement towards safety, it allows you to hit more stuff.  4) Do not save mana when you are at full mana, you are essentially wasting overall dps. (Does not hold true for late game)  5) Know which targets are safe to hit. Going into 4 people to execute someone, might result him still living and you being cc'd to death.  6) Know what abilities characters have and their default aggro range, if you get engaged on as you misjudged kerrigan's sprint and dive into combo, it's better to just wait and poke with Q whilst you wait for a misposition or engage by another teammate.  However, if you want a more detailed explanation of what you did wrong/do right, you really need to post a replay."
NexusNewbies,3coy12,harrydesmart,4,Thu Jul 9 16:50:32 2015 UTC,"The stats on the scoreboard are, more or less, meaningless.  As an example, playing as nova you may have 40 kills but the lowest hero damage because most of your attacks are going to result in a nearly instant kill to a single target.  Someone like a multi-shot Valla may be spaming a ton of aoe damage on several targets at a time, but a lot of that damage is just being soaked and healed and less likely to result in an instant takedown.  So while valla is doing more damage, she may or may not be contributing more to the actual team.  Likewise, you can tunnel heroes all game and rack up huge hero damage but in the process ignore objectives and ultimately cause your team a loss by chasing kills instead of supporting the team or playing the map.  Stats are something you should use to measure your progress and set your own goals, it should never be used to measure your character vs another because they all work differently and even a simple talent choice could radically alter the outcomes of the numbers."
NexusNewbies,3coy12,bsmntdwlr,3,Thu Jul 9 16:55:59 2015 UTC,"The point of playing, besides having fun, is to win.  If you win, just about nothing else during the game matters.  The main exception is if you were REALLY bad and helped the other team stay as close as they did or giving up gems needlessly during a game, not working with the team, etc.   If your damage is low because you can't fight long due to dying too quickly there are many things you can look at working on.  Spacing, position, who you attack, how long/far you chase, etc. Personally I am working on staying at range with Zagara. I have a tendency to right click to attack targets and sometimes the clicks either miss or lag or whatever and suddenly my squishy zerg is non-chalantly walking right into a storm of hurt in team fights.   If you are living for a while or surviving and constantly attacking/casting, then you might want to look at your ability selections. There might be others that can boost your dmg or utility and in the end increase that hero damage number.   It may also be your hero.  Some heroes can bring the pain, others cant.   Lastly, consider how much roaming you are doing.  If you are constantly traveling between objectives or catching up to teammates or whatever, that time spent traveling could add up quick.  You may only get there for half of the fight or less.   Without videos or direct examples it can be hard for others to figure out what, specifically, you could do, but consider these points and the others that people have posted in this thread. They make some great points.   The main thing is to have fun. As long as you are carrying your weight (many ways to do this outside of just hero dmg) then you are fine. The goal is to win and if that happens, you're pretty much golden.  Don't focus on numbers as a rule, but look at them more like a guide.  Like DPS meters in WoW. I would GLADLY take someone who does a fair bit less damage to a raid but is smart enough to stay alive and not take excessive damage over someone who can top the meters, but rarely survives an encounter."
NexusNewbies,3coy12,JeepCrew,2,Thu Jul 9 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"maybe you're not being aggressive enough in team fights? maybe you're getting killing blows in after dmg has been dealt?

NexusNewbies,3co3d2,mcandre,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I actually think Azmodan should generally solo lane. His range, tankiness, and wave clearing power make him a formiddable lane foe all by himself, freeing up allies to gank, guard objectives, etc."

NexusNewbies,3cp7kp,Sithrak,4,Thu Jul 9 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"If you're afking because you think the game is lost and/or you dislike your teammates or something like that? Never, never ever.  If you're afking because life happens (your dog needs out, your food got done early, your kid needs you, etc) then, while I wouldn't want it to be a habit, most people will understand and forgive you as long as it's not Hero League. Try to tell them what's happening instead of leaving them to wonder why you're not moving. Most of the time, if someone says ""sorry my dog needs out"" or something like that, people can play defensive for a few minutes and hold out as if nothing happened. It's much better than not saying a peep and going off then your team wipes because they tried to start a teamfight not realizing they're one person down.  Overall, be considerate, don't make it a habit, communicate if possible (ie not an emergency), and never afk to slight a teammate.   Edit: For technical things if that's what you're asking, there is an automatic afk timer. If you are kicked by it, you get leaver status. Your queues will be longer and you'll usually be put with other leavers. It starts out for like a game, and goes up for each time you get leaver status as it goes on. So if you get afk kicked three times, you have to play 3 games to get back to normal status. People may still report you if you afk during their games out of rage, whether the timer kicks your or if you say you afk but still hit minions to do so. Some people who get reported do get tempbans for it."

NexusNewbies,3cp7kp,axxl75,3,Thu Jul 9 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"Probably depends on how often you get reported or how often you do it in general if they have good AFK or Leave detection. If you leave a game once every 100 games probably won't be a problem. If you leave once every 10 games then you're toxic and deserve to be banned (or at least put in queue with other afkers). Why not start working on your attitude and block chat or something so you don't flame and rage and understand that it's just a game and rage quitting is just stupid rather than wondering how many times you can AFK without being caught. It's a 20 min game at most. If your house is on fire and you have to AFK then fine (shouldn't happen often though). If you have a knock at the front door and have to AFK for 2 minutes once in a while it's not going to be a huge deal. If you're AFKing for ""life problems"" so often that you're worried about being punished then you're either lying about the reasons you're AFKing or you have such poor planning that you can't think more than 20 mins ahead to play a quick game."

NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,AsianDecoration,7,Thu Jul 9 11:14:53 2015 UTC,I've seen it used for escape - if you're outnumbered you can vp the enemy team and the rest of you can run to safety. I've seen it used on bosses the enemy team is trying to cap if the rest of your team isn't there yet giving you extra time to try and contest it. Same for other objectives like pirate turn in or cursed tributes. Mostly I have seen it used for escaping or using it as a tool to reset cloak and cooldowns and burst someone down that was almost dead.
NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,Boobtape,3,Thu Jul 9 12:01:08 2015 UTC,These are all viable uses but most of the time you're going to want to use it on 2-3 enemies in a team fight. You can quickly turn a 5v5 into a 3v5 or 2v5 for 4 seconds.
NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,Ryguy_69,4,Thu Jul 9 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"Don't forget you can void your immortal on the new map to give your team extra time to get theirs down.  Void prism your core to keep it alive for your team to come up or to make it survive the cannon shots on blackheart.  HOWEVER, When I use it in a team fight I use it similar to Anub's webblast but better! Try to find 2 of their teammates that are far back. A jaina/kael as they deal massive damage or a long range healer like malf that if you vp you turn the 5v5 into a 5v3. Even if their teammates realize this and start running into the VP this makes them really clumped for AoE damage when they come out and they take extra damage going in. But I find that if you only get 1-2 the rest will stay out, if you get 3-5 then they freak out and run in to join their teammates.   But think less about who you're using the VP on and more just if you see 2 of them clumped then get them. IF you can do it because their tank is out of position with someone else VP the tank and leave their squishes. The most ideal would be tank/healer in it. But this rarely happens :P"

NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,MrRoadApples,3,Fri Jul 10 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"First for the shorter answer, at level 20, Rewind is generally considered the most effective Zeratul talent. With wormhole and  double singularity spike, you get 4 blinks, 4 singularity spikes and double cleaves. The burst can be nuts.  As for Void Prison, it's a very versatile ult, but like most of the wombo ults, it can be timing dependent (even on voice comms yesterday, my friend who was learning zera accidentally cancelled out my wailing arrow 5 times for example).   The biggest one seen is the wombo starter. The enemy team is running through a choke point and clumping, you drop Void Prison to catch them all. Your team counts it out then drops all their aoe ults and then the singular ults and aoe basic abilities mop up whoever survived the initial blast. Pickoff potential-you drop your ult on part of the team. Your team now has five seconds to dump all their damage into the 1-2 members not in stasis. Ideally once the void is finished they're down a member or two. Who you leave out of the void depends. Usually you want to catch out either their tank alone, their healer and a ranged dps, or someone you know they'll be at a disadvantage fighting without. It's not a cut and dry thing and you'll have to figure out this over time with trial and error. Also, if the person caught out realizes they're done without doing something and purposely runs into the void, you can easily switch to the first point and wombo them down as they all run into the void prison to save themselves. Defenses-There are three ways a void can be used defensively. The most common is to drop it to catch enemies while you or allies flee. Another is to void your core itself when people are pushing into it. It buys you time and I've seen it save games. A third is a bit more tricky, but sometimes allies of yours will use it to save themselves, because it freezes them too and sometimes preventing that damage can save them from death. Zoning/stalling-You can use it to zone the enemy team out of an objective or to prevent them from getting merc camps, bosses, objectives. I've actually stole tributes and things before by dropping void prison and channeling it while they're all caught and clumping. If your teamfight isn't on point for whatever reason, you can use the void to give your team more hit and run tactics and not sacrifice the objective because you can't fight them directly and win."
NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,dreamslave,2,Thu Jul 9 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"Think of it likes stun. Use it to disable MOST of the enemy team. Determine which of the enemy heroes are the squishiest, DPS...y squishy, damage-dealing heroes and imprison everyone but them. That way, the enemy has to either run or fight alone for a couple of seconds. That's your chance to reduce the enemies damage output giving you an edge.   Or you can always use it when your Nexus is at 2% health. Clutch the game."

NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,Miraun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"One if it's main uses is to turn around a teamfight. You start fighting 5v5, and suddenly you realize that their 2 assassins are away from the healer. You can use VP to remove the assassins from the fight and turn it in a 5v3 for a moment, or on the support to try to burst down the assassins. Think about it like a remover.

NexusNewbies,3cnxo0,HaiKarate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"You have to pick them when they're at some relative distance. If the supports runs into it and you expect a huge comeback (like if they have not used any ults yet and your team did) you can always use that time to disengage. The thing is that to make a good play you need the support of your team. If one of your tanks blocks the supp from going to the bubble he can be killed.  Another thing you can do is set up wombo combos. I mean, if they all 5 run into the bubble, then you can AoE them to death once the time expires.

NexusNewbies,3cneuq,duhhhhhderek,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"no, came with codes for zeratul, zeratul ronin skin, sonya, li li, zagara, jaina, and golden tiger mount.   also as far as ive read if you use the ronin zeratul skin first, it unlocks the hero so you get an extra zeratul to give to your friends."

You get three heroes, two of which are solid for HL (Muradin and Malfurion) and a stimpack that helps leveling not be such a pain. On top of that you get a cute armored horse. For the $ value it's worth it if you are going to be playing a lot or are even remotely interested in the game."
NexusNewbies,3cneuq,cm512,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:16:23 2015 UTC,Yes this is great value and strong start to your hero collection.  Take advantage of the stimpack as other have mentioned.

NexusNewbies,3cneuq,snowpuppii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain as say no. When looking at a lot of these bundles I like to look at heroes for a more true value. Skins, mounts, and stimpaks are nice, but their gold justification is a little bit harder. So looking at the starter pack you get 3 heroes worth 6k gold for 5 bucks. Take that an measure against weekly 50% off sale on heroes which if you hit a 10k hero you are getting 10k gold value per your $5. Using that logic all of the sudden these value packs aren't that valuable. Next is the heroes you get. Being a newbie you won't know which hero you'd like and which is effective in game play. I'd say give it a few week's rotation for you to get your understanding and preferences in before putting down hard cash for the game. Because I've gone through the same dilema starting out and found that I actually don't like too much of the heroes in the nexus bundle. Personally I find the retail box the most value to me for the money and the heroes I'm getting. But so play through some first. Gold should come quick in the beginning you probably have 10-20k in 2-3weeks."
NexusNewbies,3cneuq,snowpuppii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate that you put so much effort in your answer.   The thing is, I'm brazilian, and I don't think that the retail pack is available here. I would buy it in a heartbeat, but unfortunately that won't be possible.   One question, though: does the stimpack increase the gold gained from reaching x level, or daily quests?"
NexusNewbies,3cneuq,Neiroch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"I think the online vendor Oktober mentioned: Dlgamer send you the code online? The redemption on the can be tricky I've read so buyers beware. Or maybe Amazon? If you do get it tho make sure you redeem only one of the zeratul code and sell/trade/gift the other. Stimpack does 2 things. Xp bonus for 100% and gold for 150%. So it will help you get higher player level to get gold and heroes to level 5 also for more gold. The 150% gold bonus is only the match reward, so it don't add to daily quests. However there is more gold to be earn per QM than say versus AI so there is that (QM with stimpack is like +50 gold for lost and +75 for win?). Note that you also get a stimpack after hitting level 10 on your character level so after I hit level 10 I tried to play like a madman to milk the stimpack. If you play agressively I think 40k gold after a few weeks is possible."

So when things take a turn for the worse, Abathur is the easiest target for their frustration.  Don't worry about those people. There will be whiners/complainers/blamers in games like this. Keep playing Abathur, watch your replays to spot mistakes you may have made, and learn from them."

NexusNewbies,3cm99i,DuckAndCower,2,Thu Jul 9 21:54:52 2015 UTC,That's true they kind of do do that. I always just assumed thats what they normally do (I don't hold my solo queue quick match team mates in very high regard.) But in their defense it's somewhat similar to Zagara's Hydralisk mark which is much more common and the best defense for that is to run away.
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,hacdladf1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:37:21 2015 UTC,I feel bad when I get the hat and am playing one of my assassins.  I feel like abathur wants me to go balls deep and I'm sitting here expecting to die if I play more aggressively.
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,levinho,2,Sun Jul 12 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, Abathur not being in lane can easily gives the false perception that he's not helping like everyone else, since you can see most of his interactions by glancing at the minimap.  Very similar to how absence of sound alters the perception of an event's length or how micro-transactions foster the false perception that one is spending less, when the cumulative purchases often amount to a price above common market value.... <cough>"
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,8bitsquid,2,Thu Jul 9 22:43:04 2015 UTC,"I'm always excited when there's an Abathur in the game. If they're on my team, and someone flames them or asks why they're AFK I'll usually educate the accusing player on what Abathur does or how they're being useful. If they're on the opposing team, I jump for joy and pick Zeratul, and then go hunting in the early game, and ask my team where the locusts are coming from. Overall, I hope more people get to know Abby's role and how useful he is when fighting."

NexusNewbies,3cm99i,Zool2107,2,Thu Jul 9 08:08:53 2015 UTC,"It's easy to blame the ""AFKathur"" for the team fails rather then the shortcomings of the players themselves."
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,Boobtape,2,Thu Jul 9 12:02:02 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm not a god-tier Abathur but I have converted quite a few random teammates to believing Abathur isn't a waste of a hero pick.  Link to hotslogs profile   I have only played him in QM and usually play him solo, but sometimes with friends.  That said, you will get shamed/blamed/etc lots.  Get used to it. It's ignorant people being ignorant.  Abathur is a very different hero from just about every other hero I've played including other games (LoL, Smite).  The masses don't know this simple fact and because of this they assume, incorrectly, that he plays like everyone else and since they never see you in team fights, grabbing objectives etc, that you are a waste of hero.   Here are some tips to possibly help your numbers at least look better (while performing better) so when they complain, you can point to the score screen and shut them up.      Since you can bounce around the map with Symbiote, you should try to be top contributed xp every game.  It won't always happen, but you can really help your team buy keeping the levels close or putting your team on type by soaking tons of xp.  How do you do this you ask?  Dual-laning.  Let's say you are playing mines.  When the mines open, usually both teams go in and team fight.  Lovely.  That means at least 2 usually, if not all 3, lanes are open and just minions duking it out.  What you can do is deep burrow or run to some bushes near minions fighting and use your body to soak xp.  Then you can symbiote minions on second lane, and get xp from there.  Your symbiote gets xp as if it were your hero. Now your team is getting xp as if 2 heroes were still laning, but all 4 are together for the team fights.  Disclaimer: Don't do this 100% of the time, every time.  Abathur is about map awareness and helping your team in many, many ways. You may need to help your teammates in the fights by symbioting one.  You can still put your body in a lane to get the xp and then ""hat"" your ally and help. Lastly, if you do put your body out in a lane, be VERY aware of enemies. Respawns, cloakers, etc. Try to make sure you have deep burrow available to GTFO when an enemy hero is closing in.     Map awareness: This is something I struggle with still but focusing on it, I have improved quite a bit.  You need to be the general.  Ping minimap to alert teammates of traps/danger, Symbiote buildings/minions to help push/stop a push, alert teammates to objectives spawning (people tend to ignore/not see/get tunnel vision), call for retreats, etc.  They may not heed any of this, but at least you tried.  If they were smart, they would listen.  If you warn them of danger and they narrowly get away, that might be enough for them to start paying attention next time you ping.     For the time being, tell your teammates before gates open that your shield doesn't necessarily mean to get back into the fight.  Abathur's shield is great, but not super-strong. Usually it stops 2-3 auto attacks usually from my non-scientific observations.  It's better to use as a getaway helper than to get a hero back into a fight. Obviously, if they are high health you can cast it preventatively and that will help, but make sure to tell them that if they are fleeing and see you pop onto them and shield them, that unless they can kill that chasing hero in 1 or 2 quick hits, to keep running.     Pro-tip: Do not be afraid to un-symbiote your allies.  The cooldown on shield and spikes is quite a bit longer than the cooldown on Symbiote itself.  What does this mean for you?  It means you can symbiote an ally, shield them, throw up a spikes and even 2 or so Stabs, then remove symbiote (R-key), wait the 3 seconds or so for Symbiote's cooldown, and then cast it on the same ally again, with all the abilities back up, ready to use.  Your shield ability has a 12 second cooldown but Symbiote itself is 4 seconds.... See what I mean?  You can get 2 shields, 2+ spikes, and several Stabs in the time it would take to get 1 shield, 2 spikes, and more stabs, but IMO shielding is more important than the Stab pokes in a fight (though GREAT for chasing/getting excape kills).     Last tip: When you cast a shield on an ally, DO NOT remove your symbiote until it has been used up unless they no longer need it. When you remove your symbiote, the shield goes with it. So if you cast shield on an ally, then almost immediately release to go help elsewhere, he just lost what was left of his shield and you might have just wasted some time or kept him/her from escaping.       I will end my thoughts here as apparently I decided to crit you all with a wall of text.

Sure, this isn't the most helpful use of Abathur early on, but then full-stack Monstrosity starts pummeling out-of-position heroes for 400 dmg/hit and nobody realizes.  The rants in support of Abathur are neverending because so few people understand his mechanics, so by all means, sir, rant away."

NexusNewbies,3cm99i,Malkiero,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"Echoing what other comments have said, hang in there!  When Abas contribute big to wins, I feel like no one really notices. When Illidan is diving 1v3 and we're behind, it must be someone's fault! And even if Illi knows how Abathur works, maybe he can convince someone else on the team that it's totally Aba's fault and then at least he doesn't have to feel like it's his fault. Usually the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory is somehow involved.  One thing that I find helpful for success in games when I'm on our favorite space slug is making sure to show love to all of the lanes/champs in the early game. One lane will be ""1v2"", so that ally needs a bunch of mines/tophats, of course. But when it's possible to switch to other lanes, definitely spend some time there helping out - even if it's not critically helpful. Tophat someone, and just put up that carapace shield and fire some shots in the dark. Even if I'm not hitting anyone, it's not like the tophat has a mana bar, and it lets the player get a feel for the range of the abilities and the strength of the shield. And also I think people just like knowing that they have an audience and a wingman."

NexusNewbies,3cm99i,klunkthespacecat,2,Thu Jul 9 21:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the monster style just isn't what most people do. So if you do it they go omg, you arnt doing x! you must be bad lol. But man, the monstrosity at high levels has at least 5k hp. This is the same amount as like anub. It isn't a squishy thing and with 400 damage a whack with the AoE spikes to heal it and slow enemies while getting the lvl 20 burrow, which helps keep half of its stacks ;3, it becomes amazing."
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,UltiBahamut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:51 2015 UTC,"I'd attribute this to people not understanding in full how Abathur functions. This results in people not knowing how to play with him, which makes for a bad team. There's not much you can do about this problem, but you can remedy it by calling shots in game. Once you get better, less and less people rage at Abathur. In the meantime, you have to get good at defusing flamers. You have to keep your head calm and say things like ""chill, we got this"" or ""it's all good, next fight"" if someone starts flaming."
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,MrRoadApples,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:46:31 2015 UTC,"I usually blame this on people lack of knowledge. Abathurs usefulness is directly based on the teams ability.  One thing that I noticed helped a lot one game... I played a warrior and had the hat all early game. So I was plowing through people. Mid/late game the other team was scared of me, so he changed hosts a little bit but came back to me. I loved it because I felt like a boss haha"
NexusNewbies,3cm99i,Spe333,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"I think people always expect the hat to be on them, or are too aggressive when they have the hat. Thus, they charge 1v3 and die, as Abathur's hat isn't enough to fill in two roles. If they really don't know how Abathur works, as in, they are blaming you for not participating and letting them go in 4v5, just burrow in during a teamfight, slap some enemies, and die. Now you have time to explain why you are always afk, and you might even succeed in slapping the enemy to death. If you do, go to r/slapathur and post a replay."

His ability to dish out 4 stuns that can hit multiple people just makes him so good. Sure he doesn't have the survivability as the other 2 but considering that the meta seems to be a lot of burst champions his CC enables Janna and KT to just destroy people. Add to that the fucking bettles that own KT and everyone else with skillshots. Just a thought from another rank 1

NexusNewbies,3cli6y,hacdladf1,0,Thu Jul 9 13:55:17 2015 UTC,You need to play your zagara more defensively and with more creep then. She gets a natural movement speed buff and health regen :D   With the right talents and creep placement no one can sneak up on the Broodmother.

NexusNewbies,3cli6y,tld1990,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"The amount of damage is very significant though.  Constant push and constant annoyance.  Great to combo with a burst DPS who can hide behind the spiders, frogs and gargantuan.  There very little burst, but if you actually land your spiders on the hero, same with your Gargantuan, the damage is there, full blast of frogs even on a tank will make them flee.  His zombie wall is great against meta choices like jaina and keal, or most of the supports.  His spiders are also a very annoying poke on tributes, temples, dragon spawn, behind walls, or squishy assassins.   I agree Zagara early is way better, but a good team that kills the creep will easily negate her and Nezeebo I think scales better later game.  Most of the HL games I've played with him, I've lead the teams in Hero dmg, and close in siege dmg (sylvanas usually gets that)"

NexusNewbies,3cli6y,FallenEinherjar,0,Wed Jul 8 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"How would you suggest picking up Uther, Abathur, and Illidan/Kerrigan while keeping your strategy hidden as long as possible? Assuming your entire team can fill any role, can you run through of who to pick first if you have that pick, or second and third if the opponents have first pick? Laying out the rest of the picks would be nice too and how to react if they pick up certain heroes that are good counters for your strategy first, but I'm more interested in the basic strategy of getting your 3 main heroes right now.  I'm under the impression you have to pick Abathur and his partner together or is that a misconception? Can you just go Abathur first pick and since the options still wide open for your team and as such they can't simply pick up Uther and/or Kerrigan to ruin your strategy?"

Another thing you can do is compare the server it seems to put you in to your brothers and where you live. If you get into a game, hold CTRL+ALT and press F. You'll see a couple things pop up in the top left if you did this right.  The fourth one down or so will be something similar to ""Location"" I think it's called. You'll see it says something like ""US8"", ""ORD1"", or ""EU8"". This is the server and region the game has you in. You can also see your ping right above this. The server you're currently in can change from game to game, and can sometimes not correspond to the region your account is in.

NexusNewbies,3cm0mp,wellsdavidj,6,Wed Jul 8 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"The stat screen will show each player getting all the experience from the wave, however the TEAM's experience will be the exact same as if only one player was soaking the lane. You only need one player in a lane to soak maximum xp.   So if a minion wave is worth 1000 xp and there are 5 players killing it, each player will have ""contributed"" 1000 xp, but the team only gains 1000 xp total.  That is why it is so important to have someone in each lane early game, so you don't miss out on any xp. The Pro teams you are talking about are more organized than 99.9% of us and they probably time their rotations so they can kill each minion wave from all 3 (or 2) lanes."

NexusNewbies,3cm0mp,BirosHS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:19:27 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Thank you for the info
NexusNewbies,3cm0mp,Ons_Duiwel,3,Thu Jul 9 00:31:50 2015 UTC,It's a general tactic to have 1 or 2 heroes visible in the lane and the others hiding in bushes waiting for the opportunity to rush down the enemy heros. If the enemy team distributes the heroes between the lane it can be an easy 5 vs 2 battle. After that they can rotate to other lanes.  An other interesting thing similar to the experience stat table and team xp is the Takedowns columns. Because every hero who damaged the enemy hero who dies gets the takedown point. Not only the one who makes the killing blow. But I don't know exactly how the healer get the takedowns after heals.
NexusNewbies,3clwsu,electricviper,2,Wed Jul 8 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Most roles are solidified in the sense of 1 tank, 1 support, 3 dps.  The 3 dps can be attributed to 1 half support or even 2, in the form of Tyrande, Tassadar and Brightwing(lul).  And a full time dps, namely Jaina and K'T as core in most matchups.   You do not specifically need to have a specialist slot taken, but it would help with your team's early game push power and objective control.   1 tank, 1 support, 3 dps (2 dps, 1 specialist)"

NexusNewbies,3clwsu,404clichE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"Haunted Mines:  It's all about that push!  Heroes that can siege well and have a strong early (read pre-level 10) team fight are what you want to pick up.  Sylvanas is widely considered to be a must-pick on this map.  Example Team composition (with no knowledge of what the other side picked): Sylvanas, Malfurion, Valla, Jania, Anub'Arak.  Here's an example of how the game could play out if things go well for you/even for you.  Lane Assignment 4-1.  Send Valla solo (she's the safest solo laner you have) and the other 4 in the lane that your golem will spawn in, since you have Sylvanas you will push faster and the opposing team will need to respond your push, or lose a lot of buildings.  Objectives: Mines open at 1:30, you'll want to have 1 lane shoved (probably your 4-lane, but not always) so that you can go down into the mines as single unit.  Head to the middle of the mines (that's where the most skulls are) and start gathering.  There will likely be many small skirmishes.  As a general rule only split into smaller groups if the enemy team has members dead.  As the golems are spawning head to your siege giants but do not cap them until their golem is halfway through the lane.  This will keep your siege giants behind your gate and will really help in killing their golem.  Since you have Sylvanas you will want to send most or all of your heroes to push with your golem (she turns off the towers that do the lion's share of damage to the grave golem).    After both golem's die there will be 2 minutes before skulls spawn again. Use this to push with mercs, try and get more XP than them, or capture mercenaries (bonus points if you have mercs pushing when mines spawn).  The writeup is heavily biased on having Sylvanas in case you didn't notice.  If they pick her before you do, grab someone with a strong push (Zagara/Nazeebo work well) and spend the game responding to where she is trying to push, and punish the opposing team when she is dead."

NexusNewbies,3cliob,twispi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:30 2015 UTC,"Anub'arak is a very good frontline. He is one of my best tanks and he is just an all around fun hero to play.

I know it can be hard to see someone playing characters you know and love a certain way, but I'd ask first if they want advice or help before just going out and saying it.

There are some people I play with that even giving them advice they either ignore it or do their own thing anyway trying to rationalize their talents are right and I'm wrong. They don't want to play competitively and they don't want to get better, they just want to play. As frustrating as that can be sometimes, I know they're not going to change so I can either not play with them or I can let them do their thing while I do mine.

NexusNewbies,3ckh96,dreamslave,6,Thu Jul 9 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"3) If you haven't reached Lv25 (unlock all hero talents), please avoid QM unless you're fairly confident in your abilities. Many of the best talents are locked through hero level 1 and 2, and playing QM without those options severely hamstrings your effectiveness and makes things tougher for your team.   I kind of disagree with this one.  Not the facts about it - that not having all the abilities gimps your options, but rather that people under 25 should avoid quick match.  QM is low-stakes.  There's no downside to losing a match.  Like, I know there is QM MMR, but let's be real, it doesn't mean anything.  QM is unranked mode.  Losing a quick match because of a silly teammate who doesn't have all the skills might be irritating, but it's far from the end of the world.  What you can learn from solely playing AI games is pretty limited, in my opinion.  I feel like a new player will learn more from QM games where they have limited skill options than from playing AI games until they get to 25.  Just my opinion, of course."

I'm not saying you play AI games til 25, just til your free week hero is Lv3 or Lv4 and you can use their best talents. I understand fully that you will learn mainly bad habits in AI games, but if you enter knowing that and do it simply for the XP, it's much less selfish than causing four other people to lose because you are walking blind into a QM with a hero you can't play."

NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,snowpuppii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think with HL, its all about the composition and map. You have to learn who Abathur is great with (I've heard with Butcher he is awesome). Sylvanas may be good to have just in case you get a map like Mines and the enemy don't pick her. I'm currently learning Zagara, and her vision control is so great on some maps, as well as her pushing power. I think each specialist does a different job, so you have to find the right moment for them."
NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:11:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, specialists are the hero bracket with the most variety, that's for certain. Each one plays pretty different from each other and has a different quirk. :)"
NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,Talashandy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"I actually find the specialist grouping very unhelpful. Its feels like each have an identity of there own. Gazlow, Hammer defends a space very well. Nazeebo and Zagara and dps and push towers etc.. But my question really is how do they fit into the HL setting. I don't imagine specialists get picks 1st and the rest of the team then build around said hero (except for syl on haunted mines). Can  I really get away with having one and let one of my other 4 teammate fill in with zagara, azmodan or what not."
NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:14:11 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas is probably one of the best pushers, which is why she's consistently picked in HL. She also brings to the table dot dmg and silence to team fights."
NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, it depends. I think the main thing is for specialists, moreso than other groups, you need to look at what they bring to the table and what your team needs. For example, Sylvanas and Zagara both bring a lot of damage and sieging power, but Zagara grants your team vision while Sylvanas locks down towers and minions as you fight. Azmodan can punish enemies who don't clean up their lanes/ignore minion waves because his General of Hell is global. Abathur's buffs and abilities can give the extra defense/offens that someone needs in an opportune moment. Gazlowe's turrets and Nazeebo's poison can easily pick off an unaware hero without wasting abilites or cooldowns. The Vikings can soak lanes while the rest of your team grabs objectives which can give a huge level lead and make the enemies choose what is more important to them in the moment. The variable kits can mean there's a lot these heroes can do to contribute to a vareity of teams that may not be so straightforward. You are right, specialists are usually 4-5 pick, not first usually. It's good to see what the team is building for either through hover picks or lockins before choosing them.  In the long run, I suppose it depends on who you group with. I like playing specialists and supports, but I hate warrior/tank. I have a friend who prefers warrior or melee assassin and so usually since we game together we're nine times out of ten fine with eachother's picks."
NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"It's generally recommended you have at least 2 heroes of each role for HL. I don't really play hl myself because I think I'm not ready, but I don't think Abathur alone would be enough most of the time. My favorite specialists are Sylvanas, Zagara, Azmodan, and Nazeebo. The first three along with Abathur are usually what you see going into HL picks a lot, though Nazeebo's recent buffs could get him seeing more play soon (that and I have seen some shockingly good Nazeebo play in HL streams/recordings even when he wasn't popular to pick).  As for overall, Specialists are heroes that don't quite fit into the other three categories of heroes. They do give sieging perks, but they often bring unique abilites to the table that sway the battlfield itself in their team's favor at times. Usually specialists rely heavily on map awareness and intuition to excel.  It may be wise to try out the other specialists to see who suits you most. I hope this helps! :)"
NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"So perhaps I should change the composition to 2 dps (since supposely HL is overrun by them) 3 tank 3 support and 2 specialist?

NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,genghiskim,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"That may work out, yes. Honestly? A lot of people want to play the dps or specialist I've found. If you prefer tank or support maybe although you have them for backup you could hover over one of those and say you'll do it instead? While filling is important to do, you probably will play better playing what you love than what you don't. So I'd say keep/get them as an insurance policy but try to talk with your team to get to play what you love. Communication is the key! :)"

NexusNewbies,3ck9c3,FallenEinherjar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't worry about needing 2 (or even 1) specialists in Hero League. As long as you have at least 2 tanks/healers/DPS (and I think you have it right by going for 3 of each), then you should be fine. You'll see just as many successful teams with 2 warriors or 2 supports or 3 DPS as you do with the traditional 1 warrior/1 support/2 DPS/1 specialist. I can honestly say that I have never been in a scenario where I was last pick in HL, and everyone was pushing for me to pick a specialist (whereas I have absolutely been required to fill a tank/support/DPS role with last pick).    Abathur seems fun, but if you haven't liked any of the other specialists yet, I probably wouldn't advise you to spend 10k on a hero that (I assume) you haven't even tried yet.    If you are looking for which specialists are the strongest in the meta right now, I would say Sylvanas, Zagara, or Nazeebo are probably your best bets. Luckily, Sylvanas is in the free rotation this week, so try her out and see how you like her.    That being said, if you are talking about which supports seem the most fun to play? If you've tried and didn't like Azmodan/Zagara/Zeebo, then I'd probably suggest Hammer, who I didn't expect to like, but ended up liking immensely. I personally didn't like Gazlowe too much, but mostly because I didn't feel like I was contributing enough to team fights. I'm hoping Murky goes on the free rotation soon so I can give him a shot, but I might just buy him outright since his price dropped recently.    Good luck with your search for a specialist you like! I actually like Zagara a good amount, but I think I only have 2 games with her in HL (and literally 0 with any other specialist), and both times were in Haunted Mines where the opponent had Sylvanas. Other higher ranked players may have a different opinion than mine, but I personally would recommend that you not even buy a single specialist for HL if you don't really like any of 'em so far - it's the least ""required"" role in HL."

I am not too hot on Hammer as it feel like the game play is too static (I've played enough starcraft to have memories of slow boring pushes with tanks). I have hit Nazeebo, azmodan/zagara/gazlowe/slyannas on free rotation and honestly I think it just take me long to figure them all out. I guess that is why they are special! Abathur i've only tested on the ""try"" map so I don't have any live experience. But the game play is just so unique and being able to bounce around differnet parts of the battle field seem fun. And I'm also feeling guilty of falling for pajamathur, lol. If not then the closest for me is Sylvanas. Firstly because my main is Valla so i just treat her like another range hero and second she is the current meta. So I guess if it comes down to it Abathur is the selfish pick and Sylvanas is the group pick."

Anyways - if you've tried all the other specialist heroes and didn't like them, then I wouldn't stress about it for even 1 second. The only time I feel guilty about not having a specialist is when I have first pick on Haunted Mines, because I don't own Sylvanas yet (but I will probably end up buying her in the next couple of weeks) - in those cases, I'll just pick my strongest hero, or ask if someone else can play a specialist. When I really feel like it, I'll grab Zagara - but like I said, I've only done so twice in the past in HL, and I could have just as easily played an offtank, offsupport, or as a 3rd DPS (and played as part of a roaming/ganksquad type of team)."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,wakerdan,3,Wed Jul 8 11:00:17 2015 UTC,"Raynor is just a weak pick in HL where you rely on your team to protect you late game and not die, whilst is frankly hard to get. Also, he doesn't provide enough pressure mid-late game where your Q and autos just don't cut it.  Illidan is just a much weaker pick atm due to the lack of unstoppable, his damage is basically soakable by just malf ult. He's just a bad pub stomper.  Azmodan is meh in HL if you do not have someone to help you burst down waves to allow you to do KT like damage. If you have a duo/trio queue, then it's extremely good. However, a solo/non-farmed azmodan is basically useless as KT will do more damage and CC than you.  Jaina and KT and Sylv are such good picks that you can instantly win games just by having some presence in the game.   However, if you are solely deciding to play tanks, Anub'Arak and Tyrael are good picks to round off your pool. Generally Muradin is overall better than Anub after the beetle changes, but Anub provides more safety and ranged CC. And in pubs Tyrael's pick-off potential with his ult just decides games both early and late, also he do win most lane matchups.  ETC's ranged CC is nil and doesn't provide much pressure. Would suggest either Muradin or Anub then Tyreal in specific cases."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,4,Wed Jul 8 11:52:49 2015 UTC,What's wrong with ETCs CC (Slide and Ult?) pair it with another aoe ult and it usually does great.  Just wondering what the details are.
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,Spe333,2,Wed Jul 8 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"The issue is that his Q, his engage forces him to be melee in order to CC and do damage.  What other tanks have is ranged engage, it allows you to significantly reduce damage taken and doesn't force you into a kill or die scenario. And unlike other tanks, ETC is actually pretty squishy as his abilities do not help him with burst till 13 and 20 with power slide damage reduction and shield.   Unlike other tanks like Anub'Arak that has immunity during his burrow or Muradin that counters aspd characters hard with his thunderclap aspd reduction at 1 and double clap at 4.   Whilst Mosh is good, it has too long of a cd where almost any CC is able to interrupt it. Muradin that autos ETC whilst he starts up the first half second of Mosh would cancel it and put it on the full duration cd, or any abilities that displace, ETC's Mosh is one of the only abilities that can still be interrupted by almost any ability. All it needs to make ETC absolutely useless is to just have someone at the back that can interrupt Mosh, like Tychus or K'T, or even Valla's stun ult that is very prevalent against combo comps."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,2,Wed Jul 8 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I think you just have something against the rock-n-roll lifestyle!  Lol, but really thanks for the details. I guess I feel like his ult is only used with perfect timing and reason, so making sure to get everyone in the pit is very important. Also, I find he doesn't pretty well with his heal, does that not keep up with other warrior shields? Considering it can also be a team heal. I don't really consider him a tank either, more like a utility melee.  I can see why he isn't great once you get into higher level play though, easy to counter if they know how. At low levels though, they can't think that far ahead :-p"
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,Spe333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"The team heal with Guitar Solo is decent, however, in a teamfight that has a front line, mid and back line, it makes your aoe healing rather pathetic, it heals for basically 1-2 ticks per person, which is a 400-500hp buffer, but it's delayed and requires you to be in range.  His heal is relatively pathetic compared to the other tanks survivability options or dps. Let's take his level 10 Guitar Solo, it heals for 85 per tick for 4 seconds with a downtime of 4 seconds, it essentially gives him a 42.5 hps base not including his base regen. That's decent. However, when compared to the survivability of other tanks, having that crucial 50% heal over time from mura or cc dodge of anub'arak or the utility of tyrael, it doesn't really reflect well upon his overall power.   It's the fact that his talents are just bad. He doesn't get strong dps talents early on and he doesn't get strong late game survivability talents."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing the numbers!  I still think his utility is great for setting up shots and picking off people. Sliding into a group, and pushing someone into your team to get jumped has to count for something?  His ult has a long CD, but his other skills don't (do they?)  One thing that i really like about ETC is his push, it's great for objective fights. I play Anub a lot, and the biggest difference is the push. Sure the stun is nice and the bugs help, but he can't force chaos like ETC."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,Spe333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"The issue is that his only engage is able to be stopped by cc, he doesn't move fast and has no other ways of engaging after his Q falls short. Also his toss range is absolutely terrible without the range upgrade. Not to mention that his Q range is much shorter than hard engages by both Tyrael, Muradin and even Diablo.  It's just very easy to outrun him. And if you use your ult to engage, you still do not do enough damage or cc to warrant the tank spot."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"Those three don't have the utility that he does though. And this depends on the comp in general and rank of the team.  He just seems like a good filler hero, not a true tank. As in you have tank, support, 2 Dps.... ETC could fit in well there. Especially if the DPS have Aoe ults to combo or the team lacks CC.  Not trying to say he's great, just trying to figure out his purpose. If he has one. You seem to know your shit so I'm making the most of it lol"
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,Spe333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"If you are putting ETC as the secondary tank for the sole purpose of peeling, he still doesn't do much against the current meta of poke comps. You have to force an engage so they do not permanently poke you down and force you to back.  He does poorer damage than all the other tanks and his overall effect on the teamfight without mosh is just poor. Picking him as your second tank would mean that your dps has to be either K'T or Jaina and safety pick like Azmodan with his range.  He is by default still a tank, however, johanna took his throne as she got his echo pedal at level 1, and is much stronger throughout the game. The most lingering issue with ETC is he's well rounded, but not overpowered in any form.   When other tanks have insane survivability (Johanna, Muradin),  ranged engage (Johanna, Muradin, Tyrael, Anub'Arak, Stitches),   Scaling (Johanna, Muradin),  Early game (Johanna, Muradin, Tyrael, Anub'Arak),   Engage potential (Anub'Arak, Muradin, Tyrael),   CC dodge/removal (Johanna, Anub'Arak),  CC (Anub'Arak, Muradin, Johanna, Diablo)  He's well rounded, however, being average doesn't make the cut being a competitive pick. Why put yourself at a huge disadvantage when you can have someone that has such an insane power spike and just a little more pronounced flaws in their kit. Being the 50% benchmark for a tank isn't a good thing.  You can easily see which names are clearly repeated over and over again."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,2,Wed Jul 8 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"Oh yea Tyrael + Anub is so damn awesome. Great initiation and CC!  Muradin is prolly the most solid all rounder, Johanna falls alil behind IMO."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,Eriennyl,2,Wed Jul 8 12:18:53 2015 UTC,"due to the lack of unstoppable   Did they remove that from his Q? And he can still ""dodge"" effects with Metamorphosis, right?"
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,TenspeedGames,2,Wed Jul 8 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, which was the only reason why illidan was so sticky. Without it, he doesn't do enough damage to warrant a team to be built around him any longer. Whilst you can still dodge effects with meta, meta is just so bad now without the extra range and damage that illidan damage can be soaked through with just malfurion healing.   Which is kinda hilarious, very similar to raynor's damage output."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,2,Wed Jul 8 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"Illidan is just a much weaker pick atm due to the lack of unstoppable, his damage is basically soakable by just malf ult. He's just a bad pub stomper.   In fairness though, if you're playing as an Illidan and your generic damage output, not you ult but your basic damage, forces Malf to pop his ultra? You've done a good job..."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,You-Can-Quote-Me,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, however, once malf pops his ult, they would prob still win the fight whilst you remain kind of useless."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,2,Wed Jul 8 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if I were Illidan I wouldn't continue the engagement at that point - I'd break off and re-engage after the ult was spent. Actually, that's not even dependant on being Illidan, most people would break of and engage afterwards. Point is you got him to pop an ult because your basic attack damage was too much, which means you then force an engagement afterwards and he doesn't have that massive heal available and you can hopefully take down a couple of them in a team fight.  Illidan forcing Malf to use an Ult?  Far from useless.  If you can't exploit that situation, well, it's not Illidan who's not pulling his weight."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,You-Can-Quote-Me,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Let me just say this, where is said illidan in a fight.  On the Malfurion, guess where is the Malfurion? In the back/mid lines. Guess what if you are not ulted as illidan in the back line? You die.   The issue on hand isn't the fact that illidan forces malfurion to ult. I'm saying that his damage is literally tankable by just his ult, which makes him rather bad for a dps."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,harrydesmart,3,Wed Jul 8 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"I'm hijacking this thread with similar question. (so I don't spam front page)  I already have just 10 heroes, but I feel my collection is somewhat lackluster:  Warriors: Muradin, Diablo, Tyrael  Assassins: Tychus, Valla, Raynor  Supports: Lili, Malfurion, Tassadar  The Specialist: Sgt. Hammer (although I never played her in HL)  I reckon my warrior collection is OK. I don't play assassins that often because everyone wants to play them so I rather pick a tank or healer to be of more use to my team, but I feel I'm missing some of these hard nukers like KT or Jaina, because I'm now and then forced to play dps Tass or Raynor. Also one of those burst healers like Uther and Reghar could help I guess? Sylvanas? Which should I buy first?"
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,200dronerush,3,Wed Jul 8 14:16:12 2015 UTC,"I've got a collection very similar to yours.  In my opinion, Specialists aren't a mandatory pickup unless you like playing the kind of style that hero is.  If you're looking for a Warrior, Anub and ETC are good, cheap pickups.  If you're looking for an assassin,  Jaina, KT, and Zeratul would all fit a burst role that you're missing.  If you're looking for a healer, Uther and Rehgar will give you a burst heal option that you don't have right now."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,theExek,3,Wed Jul 8 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas or another Specialist to round out your options.  I have a ton of fun with Nazeebo.  I also have a ton of fun with Murky, so who am I to give sound advice.  If you truly want to feed on someone's hate, wait until you are picking last, then after everybody else is done picking grab Murky followed by, ""Sorry guys, he's the only other hero I own. Go easy, it's my first time with him.""  Then just sit back and let the hate flow through you."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,hoppypatamus,2,Wed Jul 8 15:04:52 2015 UTC,General advices:   Try as many heroes as you can before buying any of them. Buy what you are comfortable to play with. Check out tier lists to check which heroes are better than others.
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,BirosHS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:38:43 2015 UTC,Yes get Valla and Anub. Your specialists are solid so Sylvanas would be low priority. IMO I would say get Rehgar/BW first then Jaina/KT. The 4 main healers are pretty hot picks so having a larger pool than just 2 will be better.  Be sure to show pre-picks in HL to let everyone what u're playing and communicate so u don't end up with 4 assassins 1 specialist.
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,Eriennyl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend Johanna, Sylvanas, Jaina, Kael'Thas, Rehgar, Zeratul, Valla, Nazeebo. Any combination, or all, of these are great picks."
NexusNewbies,3cjdez,RogueT3ch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"I suggest you pick up some more AoE and CC as those are very useful on most maps.  Honestly I would never use either of your assassins as Jaina, Keal are Zera are way too good right now. ETC is a decent choice if you Mosh pit has a follow up, as in the assassins I just mentioned.  Anub is good on most comps and maps. Sylvanas is almost a must for specialist right now.  I would also figure out what type you prefer to play and focus on getting good with those heros.  It's easy to just type our in HL that you don't have a good assassin or dps, but are a good tank or support.  You will find you will get the hero you want."

I just try to cone of cold the shimmer and try to burst them, works well against nova if you can avoid the snipe. Also, if you're squishy, and they're killing you a lot, you can just group and push. They can't really contend you, especially if you're with a boss/lots of minions/obj. If you really want some payback load up as Tassadar or Brightwing.

I too play really squishy characters, but when zeratul and nova are on the other team I am always scanning for the shimmer.   I usually play Sylvanas and Jaina, and the stealthies rarely catch me with their burst openers because they're based on being stealthed when they open on you. If you negate the stealth it helps deal with some of the burst. Look for the shimmer.. and pay attention to the enemy team comp.  Jaina really fucks Nova and Zeratul up if they don't 100 to 0 you."
NexusNewbies,3cizu1,dreamslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"Oh man. Yesterday was my first time playing Zeratul. I practiced a few AI games and won both, but on my first QM the other team had a Tassadar. He single-handedly shut me down that match. He seemed to be everywhere and was constantly revealing my location when I was trying to sneak in for kills. It got so bad that I started avoiding areas he was in the last half of the match.  All that to say, yes, Tassadar is a great counter to Zeratul/Nova."
NexusNewbies,3cizu1,N8CCRG,4,Thu Jul 9 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"If you can spot the shimmer, it's generally polite to ping danger on top of where either of them are standing because a character with skillshots can knock them out of stealth and kill them pretty easily. Another thing is if they are in your lane and leave, ping danger in the direction they're going (top or bot lane is easy, just ping down or up, mid usually they do NOT wait to go into stealth before moving up or down a lane so it's obvious where they're heading nine times out of ten).   Nova and Zeratul are both fragile and I've outdueled them on Jaina, Falstad, and Valla. Nova has nothing once her initial burst is spent and can easily be outdamaged as she runs away. Zeratul's blink means he'll usually escape you if you do this, but he will have to go back and replenish his resources before he strikes again, so you'll most definitely be a pest to him at the very least.  Typically, I'd advise them to play cautious but don't be afraid of Nova or Zeratul. With one assassin on them, they usually fall. With two characters of any kind? They usually die instead of or with their target.   I hope this helps and if you have more questions, feel free to ask."

I ping it, I say ""cloak"", I ping it again and again and again.

NexusNewbies,3cizu1,creamcityjw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:31:16 2015 UTC,"The very 1st thing to learn is positioning. Stay within crowds, be it minions or other heroes. Having and escape route and not overextending is also important. When you are laning take yourself out of focus and start imagining if you were Nova/Zerutal where would I hit. Especially helpful now that Zerutal is on rotation. Also try to stay in the middle and not close to the grass. Next is map awareness. Keep an eye on the mini map knowing the stealth is not in you lane is a sigh of relief. If you are playing against a Nova this helps a ton because once a Nova decloak, a quick peep at the mini map and help you guage whether it is a real Nova or not, so that you aren't bursting down a clone. Mana management and unloading. Be conservative with your spells. Hold back on minions and even other heroes as there is a window after a decloak to burst them down before they kill you. This is where you might have to fight your instinic to bolt as soon as you see Nova/zerutal and stand your ground. You'd be surprise how this can actually save your skin. Lastly, the shimmer. Yes this can take you to the next level in nullifying stealth player. This isn't really the 1st line of defense but it does go a long way."

If they're alive and visible (and not on top of you): Use this as a time to pressure your lane, get mercs away from them, capture objectives, etc.   Dealing with them before a fight: Throw skillshots into bushes/coners.  Use Clairvoyance (on Uther/BW/Rehgar) or Tassadar's Oracle to try and find them/catch them.  Often times they will approach separate from the rest of the their team, making them easy to catch.  Dealing with them in a fight (if you don't spot them and they get their combo off): Hope your healer was paying attention!

You just have to have a better team comp than him and hope that he is just of a lower calibre than your team.  Nova on the other hand is easily countered due to her total lack of escapes, her immobility and lack of any self preservation abilities. Stick on her, and if you are able to side step her snipe, just pile on her and kill her."

I wouldn't recommend taking this approach in any situation.  If your answer is always to cross your fingers and hope your enemy makes a mistake, you'll never be improving your own playing.  At the beginning of the game if you see the enemy has one or two stealthies, keep that in mind for the entire game when you look at your own positioning.  Always be thinking, ""If Zeratul tried to gank me right now, how can I escape?""  If the answer is that you won't, then you should change your positioning.  Get closer to towers or group up with your team."
NexusNewbies,3cizu1,phoenixmike,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:03:43 2015 UTC,"However, that is the understanding for higher level games.  There's a reason why Zeratul is permanently banned in all competitive games.  Zeratul doesn't have a huge early pressure early on due to the lack of survivability with wormhole and VP and also a lack of distinct damage till level 7. However, once he hits 10, the game changes to revolving around him. VP 2-3 people with some burst damage on your team? Pick off the 2-3 And then clean up the rest with AoE.   Then the solution of not clumping up comes into play,  Tank picks someone off with CC, Zeratul VP's entire team trying to follow up, tanks instantly dies from focus fire and fights 5 v 4.   Zeratul VP's the support and burst carry, entire enemy team kites around edge of VP, instantly killing the 2 that was VP'd due to AoE, or kill the rest of the team as they can't follow up or sustain.  So, it comes into play 3 scenarios:  1) You cannot fight in small tight areas, or Zeratul will just win.  2) You cannot group up and hard engage onto the enemy team, or Zeratul would just eliminate that follow up.  3) You cannot back off quickly as Zeratul would force an engage on those that are slower and have lack of escapes. (tanks/heals)  This isn't about Zeratul ganking a lane early game and snowballing into a win. It's about him just winning due to VP and his team comp. Once he hits 10, regardless of how distinctly behind his team is, the game now revolves around him, as it grants you the power of just deciding a game every 100 seconds.  If you are going to say that my understanding is absolutely invalid, please kindly indicate how.   And I do believe that I'm of a high enough calibre to understand his impact on any game.  https://www.hotslogs.com/Player/Profile?PlayerID=613329  Sorry, but I cannot fathom people just thinking about one aspect and negating the other aspects of the game. If you are solely speaking about his early game pick offs, it's better to learn lane control and let it hover around 25% of the lane towards your side. This way you can soak all exp without getting into harms way, and can also force push it out into a neutral state if there's an objective."

If players are asking for advice in a thread like this, we can assume they're trying to gather more information so they can improve their own playing.  ""Hope that he is just of a lower calibre than your team"" doesn't give OP any useful information they can use to improve.  That being said, I'm thinking you're definitely correct about these points regarding Void Prison, and this explanation of why was very helpful - thanks!"
NexusNewbies,3cizpk,Gekkel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:44:04 2015 UTC,"So I found this build on the internetz, it looks good, nice and sustained damage, not so much relying on mana. I guess with this build you can tear through enemy warriors quite decent, opposed to most other assassins. But somehow I got the feeling this definitely is not the best build for Valla, atleast not in every situation."
NexusNewbies,3cizpk,amsiemonster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:45:58 2015 UTC,I usually use this build when I play Valla mostly so I don't have to rely on mana quite so heavily and she has some decent sustain. I'll admit that I'm not really a super great player so it suits me better as well. :)
NexusNewbies,3cizpk,amsiemonster,2,Wed Jul 8 11:03:20 2015 UTC,"So I tried this build myself. But I feel like missing some burst or something. I checked the rest of the talents but there are not really other talents with which you can improve the damage of multishot and hungering. Only one talent to get an extra bounce of hungering, thats it. So this might actually be the best build, damage-wise."
NexusNewbies,3cizpk,DrMikeTyson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:51:09 2015 UTC,Yeah that's definitely the drawback...but I just sort of came to accept that I wasn't going to be the burst damage on my team with this build. I'm going to sit in the back and patiently whittle someone down. It's just a slow burn sort of build. If I feel the itch to be bursty I'll pop on Nova for a couple of games instead.

If, however, it starts to take too long then they'll throw you in with groups. I heard that the 6 minute mark is the hard cutoff, but I don't know the details. If you only waited a minute or so, then you're with other solo queue."
NexusNewbies,3cj2vr,N8CCRG,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:55:39 2015 UTC,"The climbing system is made so that if you win your first games you will rise very high very quickly. With your record I think you will stop getting bonus points between ranks 10 and 12, which is above average (average is between 15 and 20 I would say).   If you queue up in a 5 player premade you will always face full team premades. But you can face 4-players premade. Usually you will also have one in your team tho. You can check on the stats screen at the end of the game to see if they were in a group. Sometimes solo Q players just switch together very well and have a great teamplay just using the chat."

They have 2 queues, solo and team. I saw a pie chart where like 85%+ were solo queuers, so you shouldn't be facing 5 man premades often at all, only if you're also pre-made with any number of players. Experienced players will group with their team though, its well-known that doing a bad decision as one is better than doing a good one as half a team."

NexusNewbies,3ciuao,only_your_enemy,2,Wed Jul 8 06:32:40 2015 UTC,"He basically out-duelled anyone that couldn't 100-0 him, he would heal for 40-45% of his hp every 8 seconds. And do decent ST damage to them as well.  However, to note that this was before burst ranged dps was introduced, namely Jaina and Kaelthas.   The only burst dps that was competitively picked was Kerrigan and Zeratul.  If they released Thrall in the current meta, he wouldn't be such a insta-nerf material as before, or rather he would be decently balanced.  Basically, he was nerfed by reducing his heal gain on his passive. And the rework essentially killed him."

But the changes put his spike to level 16, which by then, anyone still outscaled him.   Also, I didn't say that removal of battle momentum wasn't the primary issue."

NexusNewbies,3cgoub,Fallen_Autumn,6,Tue Jul 7 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"I recommend watching some videos or streams of Rank 1 Zagara players and noting the situations in which they use Maw - that will be the most effective use of your time if you want to learn.    I only played Zagara during the free week, but enjoyed her. Maw is great for many things. Here are just a few examples of situational uses:     Trapping multiple enemies and allowing your team to regroup//set up for a burst (maw lasts 4 seconds, so people can pop their abilities right before it ends) Trapping multiple enemies to relieve pressure while punishing an enemy who is overextended Trapping enemies to provide peels for your teammates Blocking enemy escape routes - can be very useful if your team controls the team fight, you can deny escape and finish them off if you're near a choke point. similarly, you can cover your own escape by using Maw to block a choke point you're using to escape   There are plenty of uses for it. I'll just leave you with those points, as it's hard to establish some sort of rule for when to use it"

NexusNewbies,3cgoub,fanboyhunter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:29:37 2015 UTC,"Nice post.  Covered some things I didn't think of and other uses for Maw.  I will look into trying to use it more your way as well (blocking off bottlenecks, etc)."
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,4,Tue Jul 7 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"I think that in order to elevate your game to another level, you have to go from ""understanding"" mechanics to applying them creatively. Whether you're using Muradin's Dwarf Toss to hop over walls for escapes/jukes, using Maw as a roadblock, using Nazebo's zombie wall to shield your healer, or even sitting on top of Rhegar's healing totem to make it hard to target."
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,SchAmToo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  And once I see/hear about something I hadn't thought of, it goes right into rotation lol.  As I stated in my post, for me it has basically been an escape mechanic or a ""save the teammates"" ability to try and grab as many enemies and give my team time to get away.  Using it as a roadblock and ways like that can really help turn it into a more offensive weapon.  Thanks again for the tip!"
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,nightshiftb,3,Tue Jul 7 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"Maw is so good on the enemy team, if you can get all of them at once, get their healers, or nab their backline.   It's also good for escaping (you/team being chased, maw slows them)   It can also be used as a wall. If you miss your maw the chances/opportunity to capitalize on the maw's ability to body block is not wasted!"
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:10:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I have to admit I'm always a bit reluctant to use it as a wall because something inside of me says 'that's wasting it!' but it can hardly be called a waste if I'm still alive after using it!
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,2,Tue Jul 7 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"The danger in using it doesn't come from missing. . Rather, from accidentally hampering your team in some way, instead of helping. When I first started zag, I did that a few times and felt terrible... blocked my team from pursuing a sure kill. Ah well, live and learn..."
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"We have all been there.  For me, it was missing their team entirely and blocking 1 or more of my teammates either on the wrong side or in a corner as the enemy team rains hell upon them. :("
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,esupin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"Unless whatever you do had no positive impact whatsoever, it's not a waste.  Using it to save a teammate, escape yourself, zone them out during an objective grab (think tributes), etc is not a waste of it at all.   By that logic, anytime you use your abilities on a hero and they don't die/you don't get the objective, they have been used in waste."
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,2,Tue Jul 7 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty good amount of experience as Zagara but am by no means the definitive expert.  That said, here are my thoughts link to hotslogs profile:   I tend to go back and forth between 2 styles of play with Zagara.  One is my lane pushing style, the other is more team-fight oriented.  Devouring Maw, for me, has been kind of a letdown.  What it does is you cast it at a point on the ground and shortly thereafter (1.5-2 seconds?) it rises up and grabs all enemy heroes (and minions too I think) for a few seconds.  During this time they take some damage (upgradeable through talents) and are basically out of the fight.  After the duration, they are grouped together and able to resume fighting.   What this can do is, if targeted right and all works out, you can take enemies out of the fight for a few seconds which can turn the tide.  Their tank is getting healed and slowly wrecking your team? Maw the healer. Tank coming in with some squishies?  Maw the tank, now there's no sponge to protect the poor fellas.   That said, I find that I tend to use it as my escape.  Since we don't really have a great escape (until blink at 20), I tend to hold onto it until I'm about to get taken down or I get ambushed.  Drop it on myself as I run and by the time it activates, they have chased me on top of it. At this point you can wait a second or two, and then cast banelings back at it if that would kill them.  Or you keep running.  Or heal (talent) or whatever. But be smart. It's not going to usually kill them unless they are really low when they get caught in it.   Don't underestimate the power of taking heroes out of a team fight.  4v5 can quickly become 4v2.  In the few seconds they are trapped, you should be able to finish one or two of those off.  Then its suddenly 4v4 or 4v3 with one (hopefully) heavily damaged and that could be the turning point of the fight.   Again, I'm not an expert, I'm not a pro, but I do have Zagara as my most-played hero I think, though it may be Abathur.  I would be more than happy to answer more specific questions or have others critique what I have said. Hope this helped a little!"
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,esupin,2,Tue Jul 7 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Can you and your allies damage enemies while they are trapped, or do you have to wait until the May disappears?  Is Blink the #1 choice at 20?"
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,2,Wed Jul 8 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"You cannot damage enemies in the Maw.  They are trapped, unable to do anything, but nothing can happen to them either.  This is where some teamwork and synergy comes in.  No, while being in the Maw they cannot be damaged, but you can time attacks to hit right when they get out.   Example: A basic example is let's say that you are low on hp and running. Chasing you is some hero with low hp as well.  Not enough to die to the Maw but you may still be able to kill them.  Drop the Maw, they get eaten.  The heroes are released after 4 seconds.  What you can do is heal right after they get caught and/or time your Banelings so that they reach the maw at the 4 second mark as well as casting your Infested Drop right before that.  Because Infested Drop has a travel time between casting and landing, you can cast that on the Maw and then cast Banelings so they hit almost at the same time and give you a good amount of sudden burst.  This could be enough to drop them.   Blink seems to be the #1 choice at 20.  Zag has almost no escape. You could consider the increased movement speed on creep as an escape, but it's not terribly reliable.  So yeah, I think most people go with blink at 20 to have an escape ability.     Edit: Checking on hotslogs: For diamond-level players, ~77% of the time Blink is taken. Tyrant Maw is second with ~15%. Personally, even with 50% dmg increase, I don't see TM being a replacement for Blink. The number of times I have used it on someone and an additional 50% would get a kill is far less than the number of deaths or traps I have avoided with Blink.  Then again, everyone has their own playstyles and preferences. For that ~15%, it may work better for them.  So experiment and try different builds. Most of all, have fun!   Edit 2: Also of note: At bronze level, TM is selected ~38% of the time and Blink selected ~41%.  MUCH closer than platinum.  As you go up the ranks (bronze, to silver, to gold, etc) the number of Blink users rises and TM users falls to the level of the first edit incrementally. ie: Bronze uses TM more than silver, which use it more than gold, which use it more than platinum."

NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about hotslogs, so thanks for introducing me to that. One final question - do the summoned creatures that some heroes have (hydralisks, locusts, demons, etc) provide enemies XP when they are killed?"
NexusNewbies,3cgoub,JeepCrew,2,Wed Jul 8 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"Quite welcome.  Hotslogs is a great resource but not perfect.  They do tell you though that some ratings may be inflated and why, but theres some great info there. Popular builds, winning % of builds and you can filter by ranking (bronze, silver, etc).  Also shows your win rate with friends which is interesting lol.   As for your final question, I haven't been able to find a definitive answer.  Here are a couple odd examples that might give you some insight:       Friendly summoned minions only give xp if they get a killing blow.  So for example, Abathur's locusts only give xp if they last-hit a minion. Obviously if you or a teammate or Abathur (more on that below) are within range, then you get the xp like normal. The exception to above is Abathur's ""hat"". If he is on a minion, then the team gets xp when heroes/minions around his ""controlled"" unit dies (range is same as a normal hero).     So I don't think that summoned units give xp but I'm not 100%.  I would think that if they did, it would say on all the sites and posts listing what DOES give xp.  Only things I have seen that we are told DON'T are fountains, gates, and walls.      Hopefully that cleared up some stuff. Let me know if you find a clear answer though."

NexusNewbies,3chsmz,lmhTimberwolves,6,Wed Jul 8 00:38:31 2015 UTC,Not 100% sure but I think the single target burst combo is:  (Verdant Spheres) Living Bomb -> Gravity Lapse -> Flamestrike -> Living Bomb  That way the first living bomb can get some DoT before the second one is applied; if you're patient and the person you're targeting down isn't somebody with interrupt you could actually wait the full three seconds for the first bomb to go off before applying the second one as well for a double explosion.
NexusNewbies,3chsmz,silverhydra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"This is the optimal burst combo for one person, yea :D. This pretty much goes out the window at 16 though, once you have the Fission bomb(7), Flamethrower(13), and Ignite(16) talents, you pretty much only Verdant spheres into Flamestrike"
NexusNewbies,3chsmz,EnvyHotS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:19:09 2015 UTC,If you want to burst a single target verdant into double living bomb probably does more dmg since verdant just increase the size of flame strike
NexusNewbies,3chsmz,fabio__tche,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:02 2015 UTC,Verdant increases flamestrike's damage too. I'm wondering if living bomb has to tick a certain number of times before it does more damage than a verdant flamestrike.
NexusNewbies,3cgd0g,Ruhnie,7,Tue Jul 7 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, hardly ever the game is really lost at the draft screen. Tyrande and LiLi are not always bad picks, and your team could work with that (a warrior, an assassin and a specialist/second assassin would make this work just fine)  People that won't communicate or listen to pings are though, and you will find them from time to time, no escaping from that. What you can do is message any player you do like playing with. Add people and start duo queueing with them."
NexusNewbies,3cgd0g,polakovoador,2,Tue Jul 7 19:14:51 2015 UTC,The game can certainly be made unnecessarily difficult for your team at the draft screen.
NexusNewbies,3cgd0g,fanboyhunter,2,Tue Jul 7 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that Tyrande and Li Li can work in certain comps, depending on what the opponent has picked as well. In this instance though, we had first pick, wich was Li Li. The other team picked, I think Sylvanas and Kael'Thas, allowing us to take a strong tank or assassin. Then our next pick was Tyrande, which kind of forced the rest of us to work around, instead of just going for an overall strong comp. Ultimately the Li Li that ran around on her own all game and didn't reply to pings or chat lost the game, but still, I just knew it was going to suck after the draft."
NexusNewbies,3cgd0g,Talashandy,3,Tue Jul 7 21:01:32 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly curious why you think Lili and Tyrande aren't good picks together. I've seen them work well together on a team. Sure, the rest of the team has to fill the remainder of roles, but that's every draft."

I know I don't. The biggest issue I had with it is when they were picked, and that there wasn't any discussion ahead of time. Generally you want to take the better heroes before the other team does...unless you don't care about being competitive...in which case, you should be in QM. Just IMO I suppose."
NexusNewbies,3cgd0g,Talashandy,3,Wed Jul 8 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"You have to pick the better heroes that you can play to help your team  Of course Jaina is a top assassin, but if my team needs one I'll be picking Falstad, because for some reason I suck less with him."

I'm not sure how HL rating works (if solo is different rating than grouped)  The first game I played in HL I lost, the rest have been great. I've played against teams that give up though.  One thing I suggest if you are losing is focus on the map. Get the camps and try to get objectives. You might not have a great team, but that doesn't matter. Winning the game matters. If they have a great team fight comp, avoid team fights.  Having the first two picks be Lili and Tyrande is rough if they aren't good players. I hear ya.  So think about this differently, when playing with bad players, what hero can carry a game or change the wind. An ETC can be a powerhouse, and most players know how to take advantage of his ult/cc. Or tanky lane pushers, team fights aren't going to go your way so avoid them. Tell your team to focus on objectives and soaking lanes. Hell, just soak lanes and make sure you are doing it too. (Had one game that the whole team roamed early game, didn't soak at all. We out leveled and wrecked them even though our comp was pretty bad)"

Just add people from existing bnet friend finder threads. This sub is also growing /r/heroesofthestormlfg - though slowly, it may be of use.    The truth is, a lot of people hit 30, get 10 heroes and just start queueing HL and don't really know what they're doing, don't care, or aren't actively trying to improve their game or really climb.    Anyone you group up with from Reddit will be 10x more competent than your usual randoms, on average. Not to say I haven't matched with some great players while doing a solo Q...

NexusNewbies,3ceefm,MutatedSpleen,6,Tue Jul 7 06:59:35 2015 UTC,"Knowing what call to make during shotcalling just comes from experience. I have only played duo queue so far in this game but have been the unofficial shotcaller when I play league all the time. When nothing is going on be detailed in what you want done (mercs, rotations, pushes, soaking etc). But when it comes down to big fight sometimes repeating just the name of who to focus is great (caught a nova coming out of stealth in a bad spot? ""Nova nova nova"" loudly) You will make ton of mistakes and after the dust clears your buddies may give you shit about a bad call. But, remember 5 people following one bad call is better that 3 doing the correct call and 2 the wrong call.  In regards to knowing when to take camps/push/catch someone in a rotation that just comes from playing the game alot. You will just start to look know. Boss is often called the throw pit, but if you get good at assesing when one can be snuck/secured that often times seems to snowball games ridiculously hard."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,lesp811,3,Tue Jul 7 07:45:03 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on that last part, sometimes it is better to group and push a keep instead of taking the boss when you have a numbers advantage. Just don't get greedy, take the keep and retreat if they are close to respawning."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,incendiarysupository,2,Tue Jul 7 11:59:59 2015 UTC,remember 5 people following one bad call is better that 3 doing the correct call and 2 the wrong call.   This is the most important thing.  But a big thing is actually to allow yourself to make bad calls. noone makes the right call all the time. But the right thing to do is that when you make a bad call you try to identify what made it bad and try to figure out what the right call would have been.
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,xDigster,3,Tue Jul 7 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to be calling shots throughout a game, learn and study each map and hero, and just keep playing the game. You'll begin to understand when you should be at certain places, when to be taking camps, and when to go for objectives/push towers.  For example:   In Sky Temple, the first set of temples to be activated are top and mid, so the lane should be 2-2-1 (Top, Mid, Bottom respectively). If you know your heroes, you'll be able to tell each person what lane they should run to. Assassins should most definitely be in top or mid along with some support hero with a shield/heal/cc (Brightwing, Muradin, Kerrigan[assassin with a pull for a good engage], Tassadar, etc.), some in-your-face warriors with great cc and fighting capabilities (Diablo, Johanna, Sonya and Tyrael [for that engage], etc.) and for your solo bot lane, someone that can push and soak a lane effectively (Zagara, Sylvanas[who can also be in any of the other two lanes imo], Hammer, etc.). Also, in Haunted Mines, the map only has two lanes with an underground mine for skulls. I haven't played Haunted Mines in a while so I don't remember; however, I believe Red Team's golem spawns and goes top while the Blue Team's golem goes bottom. Merc camps will go to the opposite lane against the enemies' golem (Example: If you're on blue team, your mercs will go top since your golem goes top. Vice Versa). So, you should always go into mines and try to get as many skulls as you can. Try to coordinate with your teams to spread out to gather skulls at a faster rate while staying close enough to where if you get caught, you teammates are right around the corner able to help you. If for some reason you come up short on skulls (enemies have more skulls than you), try to grab a couple of merc camps to make it easier to kill their golems (or to shove their lanes). When you should get camps is always dependant on the games (where the golem is, where the enemy is, what the enemy is doing, how many buildings you have left compared to theirs) so be aware of your surroundings and adjust your strategy to what's going on around you.   If you want to make shot calls during just team fights or fights in general, Ping constantly and everything. If you see someone in bushes, ping danger and let your teammates know just in case they didn't see. If you see a vulnerable target, double ping them so that your teammates will focus (I feel like a lot of people miss pings, so it's nice to just double ping something so that they hear/see it). Ping where you're going if you're planning on going around the enemy team to try to get a surround on them. Ping when you want someone (or you) to engage on the team so that the enemies are caught off guard instead of you committing suicide because your teammates didn't know you were engaging. Pay attention to your teammates' (and enemies') talents. You don't want to force a teammate to engage on the enemies when their talents show that they're focusing on a healing build.  TL;DR   Learn the maps. Learn the heroes. Pinging is your friend. Watch your teammates/enemies and adapt.   EDIT: Missed a bullet point."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,puttybutty,2,Tue Jul 7 09:02:38 2015 UTC,"Learning the maps is most important IMO.  Calling the shots has less to do with heroes than map control.   A little trick for mines, you can go in early! So about 8 seconds before they open, go in and get stationed at the camps. Then camp an entrance, kill the enemy team and profit!  Pinging doesn't always work in the heat of battle, there's a lot going on so it will probably get missed."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Spe333,3,Tue Jul 7 11:45:16 2015 UTC,Btw u can peek into the mines entrance from the normal lanes. Just don't camp directly at the door ;)
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Eriennyl,2,Tue Jul 7 12:16:15 2015 UTC,True! Yea we usually wait behind a wall with a nova/zera/something at the door and shout Boo as we run around the corner lol.
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Spe333,2,Tue Jul 7 12:18:17 2015 UTC,I think heroes are just as important. You need to know what each hero is capable of and how the talents affect that hero. They each have different play styles that affect team comps and team fights. Just because a hero is classified as a warrior doesn't mean they are super tanky. Some are better at one thing than others. You should learn the hero to know how to engage each hero
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,puttybutty,2,Tue Jul 7 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"It's very important, but for basic map shot calling it's not as important as knowing how an objective works.  For gameplay it's very important, but for a newbie trying to learn the game map awareness will help more. Knowing the cool down or dmg of Novas Ult will only help him when a nova is in the game. Knowing how maps work will help him more often than that.  I assume people know that basic hero knowledge is essential though."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Spe333,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:32:35 2015 UTC,Yes. But I was also talking about shot calling for team fights.
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,puttybutty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"That seems a bit too micromanaging for someone just starting the game. And even then, it's not usually something that should be done. Players should know the characters enough to team fight effectively.  If a leader can organize the game so that they have map and objective control then they have a good chance of winning. Even if they lose team fights 90% of the time.  Not trying to say it's not important, in fact it's more important in the long run. But that usually comes with experience in game and playing the hero. Not something that you can just memorize easily and bring up mid team fight when the adrenaline is pumping lol."

NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Spe333,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"Although it's also important to remember that going after the squishies is not ALWAYS the right move.  If their tank is tanking well, getting close enough to hit the squishies essentially spells death.  You deal 0 damage when you're dead (well, unless you're Tyreal <_<), so sometimes it's better to deal what damage you can and try to whittle down the tank."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Spe333,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"Lol this conversation is getting off topic a little.   But yes, every fight is different. An ideal order means that if said Squishy fucks up and gets too close, we're going to jump him. But don't ignore all other rules of the game. Learning to team fight is more about learning to play the game, which has a lot to do with map control.  Every fight will be different, but the maps are essentially the same."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,xceph,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"I believe on the mines the normal strategy in regards to the mercs is that if you are losing the golem battle, cap the mercs AFTER the golem has spawned, and is about half way down the lane, so that they walk past one another.    This forces them to retreat from their own golem to defend temporarily, and allows you to take down the golem with less trouble.  If you send the mercs into the golem directly they get wiped out FAST.  Im no expert, just how I understand it :)"
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,puttybutty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:41:48 2015 UTC,I go for mercs right after golem spawn. Cause those stupid mercs are slow and walk behind the golem by the time you finish it and they just ignore each other.

NexusNewbies,3ceefm,Spe333,2,Tue Jul 7 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"Knowing strategy is the important part for calling the shots. I was a raid leader in WoW so this is second nature to me, but it's not for everyone.  1) I enjoy it. Like, I shine when I have people that I can rely on to take orders but also make judgement calls. I miss raid leading, so this is kind of a fix for me.  2) learn the maps. Learn when to get camps, how many Xs drop from X and all that jazz. Camp and objective control is what allows you to ""call the shots.""  3) strategy. Being able to see a strategy on a new map (on the new map, it only takes 1-2 people to defend. So I put a tank or invisible hero on defense and the rest on offense. Depending on the game of course, but this seems to works the best.) and being able to adjust mid game and know what to do to win. Basically learn the game and capitalize on mistakes.  4) stay calm. I have a friend that can lead people for shit, he gets bogged down on what ""should have happened"" instead of what did happen.  5) create an ideal kill order. So when a team fight pops up, everyone knows who to gun for. Hell, you could even assign people to focus others if the tema is coordinated. This can all go to shit, but it's good to have.  Other post have some great info, just wanted to give a different perspective."

I figured understanding the battlefield and the mechanics at hand is going to be like 80% of the fight."
NexusNewbies,3ceefm,dangz,2,Tue Jul 7 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"The raid leader in me really helps get through fights and games objectively. I didn't play SWTOR, but raiding is raiding.  Treat it just like that. Research the maps and learn how they work, the teas will always be different, the maps won't. If you have the basic strategy of the map down, then you can work on learning the rest.  A few people responded saying that learning Heroes is really important, and it is. But that comes with playing the game. As a player, you should be learning heroes and how they work. If you want to take it to the next level then you also have to learn the maps.  Learning heroes will help you deal with map objectives and make changes according to the team comp. (letting Azmodan push a lane instead of team fight, knowing you can win the team fight without him because it will force the enemy team to split up and deal with him. Therefore winning the objective and lane... Or at least having him push lane and split up the opposing team.)"

Gazlowe's expertise is zoning, which usually is related to very defensive playstyle, he is an objective-based character that excels and defending points, capturing mercenaries, and late game keep lane pressure and help with Gravity Bomb on team fights.  While all of that builds up, it's very dependent on map, because if your map does not have to defend some area specifically very often, early game he is literally weak, his turrets are awesome if you can place them preemptively so when an enemy goes for that area, will think twice about it, or eat triple projectiles from them."
NexusNewbies,3cekni,FallenEinherjar,4,Tue Jul 7 11:39:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed all the hate, though I may have just not been paying much attention to the subreddit, but here are my thoughts:  I tried playing him.  Played a couple games vs AI and a handful against humans.  I did alright, but not great.  Read guides, looked at tips and tricks, etc.  For me, he was ""meh"" and could be fun but I'll wait to play him some more.  My friend playing him:  Loves him. He needs to work on zoning out objectives better instead of just trying to kill, but besides that, we won every game he played as Gaz.  I think he's a hit or miss hero.  Either you get his style and like him (my friend) or you don't and you are mediocre to bad (me) with him.  It's frustrating to lane against or play against him, for me personally, but he's like every other character: good players make him seem amazing, bad ones make him look terrible. Play what you like.  If you win and are good with him and enjoy playing him, keep it up.  Don't worry about what others say.  One quick note about that last bit: I have been playing Abathur for about 2 weeks. First 3 games were mediocre.  I started a thread in this subreddit, read guides, watched videos, etc.  Next game (all of these are solo QM games) I was top hero dmg, siege dmg, and contributed xp.  The entire game, I had 2 teammates complaining about ""AFK Abathur"", ""4v5"", and such.  By the end, I had 3 of those teammates on my friends list and in future games, defending me as ""a god Abathur"".  I promise you I'm nowhere near god-tier lol. Since then, I have converted a few more people who thought they knew Abathur but really had no idea what his play style was like. You might be in the same boat.  Some people don't understand how to use/play certain heroes.  Others have no idea how to play the one you are playing.  They think they do, but they don't.

NexusNewbies,3cekni,henrax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:33:41 2015 UTC,Can you explain why he is so good on the new map please? Is it because of the turrets damage the Immortal or am I missing something?
NexusNewbies,3cekni,necklickhia,4,Tue Jul 7 10:39:22 2015 UTC,"His expertise is zoning a.k.a. area denial/defense. It's not that he can attack the inmortal with turrets, but he can defend his own oimmortal with them.  The middle area ofthat map tends to  become chaotic, and he keeps dropping turrets non stop, and while people is focused against heroes, turrets do their job, weakening them, is a matter of attrition. Pair it with the stun rocket, gravity bombs that can literally win team fights and the Deth Lazor, that, when used good, can destroy."
NexusNewbies,3cekni,FallenEinherjar,3,Tue Jul 7 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"Two main reasons :   Like on Sky Temple your turrets can secure the zone around an immortal, especially if you want to protect yours. The lack of vision at the center of the map makes them even more powerful. His passive ult deals INSANE damages to immortals. If your team manages to protect you, there is no way the opposite team can match your damage ourtput.   Also a minor reason is that teams often forget the mercs on this map and if you manage to secure them while your teammates stay alive it's a nice advantage."
NexusNewbies,3cekni,henrax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"My bet is because you can zone out certain area's of the middle map. The middle of the map has some cute choke points, place some turrents in range of that choke and your damage dealt will go up a lot! Hence the fights are always quite packed, so your heroic bomb combo ability can deal massive blows to your enemies."
NexusNewbies,3cekni,Gekkel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:27:11 2015 UTC,"Like Fallen said, he's not conventional. People like to learn Diablo, and then pick up Muradin or Anub and recognize there's a lot that's similar in how they want to play. Then they'll pick up Valla, and do okay with Fallstad or Raynor or whoever. But there's nobody who is at all similar to Gazlowe. Learning Gazlowe is like learning the game from the start all over again. Technically, he's a melee character, but 90% of the time you're engaged with other heroes you're not going to use your melee at all. Your resource is mana, but you also have a resource of turrets, that you can sacrifice to get some mana back. Lastly, most players think of the game as heroes vs heroes, and ignore minions and forts in their gameplay thought process, whereas those are a big part of Gazlowe.  That being said, I think his biggest weakness is no escape mechanic, and that's really hard for many people, especially on a non-tank melee. I think taking Sprint is a must have."
NexusNewbies,3cekni,N8CCRG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"I tend to dislike having Gazlowe on my team not because of the hero, but how he is played. I get that he's good at camps, but often, it seems like that's all Gazlowe players do. That's been my experience, anyway. So typically, our team will be getting destroyed by the enemy team, because it's 4v5, and Gazlowe's off capping camp after camp.   That's not to say camps are bad, but there's obviously more to the game than that. Such a limited view of the game isn't unique to Gazlowe players, but the hero certainly lends itself to that playstyle. And my luck has been that Gazlowe on my team = we're going to be down a man for most team fights, and we are going to lose."

But the rest of your team need to be able to hold their own vs enemy team. You can help out in fights ofcourse. Your turrets can do an absurd amount of damage, but your main goals should be split push, wreck enemy forts.   Maybe you are just really awsume with Gazlowe.

NexusNewbies,3cekni,Gekkel,2,Tue Jul 7 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"but your main goals should be split push, wreck enemy forts.    This is a common mistake a lot of people make. Yes, that is something Gazlowe can do well, but that Gravbomb is a monster in team fights. Good Gaz players split push and wreck forts, great Gaz players do all of the above."
NexusNewbies,3cekni,N8CCRG,2,Tue Jul 7 13:33:24 2015 UTC,I have to agree with you here. You need to find a good balance between pushing and helping out in team fights. Although if your 4 allies can hold their own vs enemy 5 you can just continue to wreck havoc in their lanes imo.
NexusNewbies,3cekni,Gekkel,0,Wed Jul 8 07:39:32 2015 UTC,"In a game that values movement, he's a stationary hero. Vs. AI, who will run past your turrets, wait for your laser to charge and obligingly stand in your bomb zone, he's a one-man wrecking crew. Against QM players, who are (allegedly) better, he's not so good. He serves in a niche role, in maps where zone defense is useful, but since most of the game involves moving, he either gets left behind or loses most of his damage in a push."

NexusNewbies,3cc0lm,pHageHunter,3,Mon Jul 6 20:33:01 2015 UTC,They give us access to seven random heroes for a week. It changes each week on Tuesday.  As always 'unlocking' heroes requires cash or in-game gold (gold that you can acquire in part by leveling heroes).

NexusNewbies,3cc0lm,bladesire,5,Mon Jul 6 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"Something I started doing with this was rotation was playing a different hero every day to level 5 getting 500 gold each, or 3500 for the week's rotation (plus quest gold and your existing pile), and then buying a hero that I enjoy. I loved Muradin and he's only 2k gold so now I can play him in the future, know I'll enjoy playing him, and I have 3k+ gold carrying over to the next rotation. Just throwing that out there because until now I just sat on my gold not sure how to go about spending it. :)"

NexusNewbies,3cc448,BFSalem,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"This. Also, she, like Tass, is very useful with another support such as Li Li, Malf, Uther, etc. I have often outhealed other supports with overflowing light in HL."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,SerenaRosaire,0,Mon Jul 6 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"That's nice and all... But it's just not true. OP is asking about viable hero league champions and ""everyone is viable if you have fun with them"" is not an answer to his question. I love stitches but I rarely play him in my hero league games because he's just underwhelming, same with my most played hero (abathur) who I only play in quick match.   Tyrande can work in hero league but if your team needs a healer and you're last pick, then no, she is not viable."

NexusNewbies,3cc448,hossimo,-1,Mon Jul 6 22:55:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, everything is viable at rank 50, but OP wants to know what heroes are viable in ranked as your progress and ""everything is viable"" doesn't answer his question at all.   You can play whatever you want, but if you really want to climb the ladder you need to recognize which heroes are stronger than others so you can practice and get better with them in preparation for climbing in hero league."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,Somenakedguy,3,Mon Jul 6 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry I thought he said he recently hit 40 and was considering playing in hero league.

I know there's a delicate balance between competition and fun but I've always been of the opinion that ranked game modes are there for trying to be the best player you could be.   If not, why not just play quick match?"
NexusNewbies,3cc448,Somenakedguy,2,Tue Jul 7 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"No worries,  One reason players, of any skill level, want to play Hero League is so they can get an idea of their skill level among other players. Also, to get better. Sure there is hots logs but as a new or lower skill player the number of times you see a 1700 player in their first recorded game on a level 10 Hero or a -100 player who has either lost all of their games or only the losses get recorded.   Another reason is the draft process, no more dual Novas or Butchers and needing to fill any roll.   Even Less experienced players still learning have a place in Hero league. And honestly, as long as you play as a team and with a sensible comp you should be able to choose any Hero, particularly just starting out."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,hossimo,6,Tue Jul 7 11:15:11 2015 UTC,"She's a great hero but she is not a substitute for a true healer. You'll still need someone like malf or reghar on your team. Think of her more as a specialist or quasi-assassin than a healer.  To make up for her comparatively weak heals, she really augments your team's offense. Her stun is easy to hit if the enemy is already stunned, so she works well with most tanks like Muradin, Anub, Arthas, Diablo and Stitches.  Her trait gives +25% damage and works well with any assassin but best with bursty ones like Jaina or Kael'thas."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,backonmygrind,2,Mon Jul 6 21:13:35 2015 UTC,I like this answer. I've been trying to figure out how to play her. She will be the first hero I buy.   She didn't feel like a very good healer. I thought support meant healer. She is a support in a different way.
NexusNewbies,3cc448,mronosa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"This past week, I've been playing her a bunch.  I've found a decent amount of success with speccing into her mark (D).  Marking someone in a teamfight is really powerful if your team is coordinated, and especially if they have a lot of burst damage.  A well-placed mark in the beginning of a fight can turn a 5v5 into a 5v4 really quickly.  Also good for getting early kills if you have a stealthy hero, or someone hiding in the bushes.  Drop a mark, hit the stun, and score a quick gank.  I have found her less useful in late game, though, where her damage is far outclassed by other heroes, and her mark becomes less relevant as the snowball begins rolling either way.  Can be vital in a boss fight, though, and definitely useful on the immortals.  Sucks when you get someone who doesn't understand that she really isn't a healer, and yells at you for having low heal numbers though =/"
NexusNewbies,3cc448,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:03:56 2015 UTC,"I have found her less useful in late game, though, where her damage is far outclassed by other heroes   With access to Focused Attack at level 4, Huntress' Fury at level 13, and Nexus Frenzy at level 20 you have respectable assassin-level auto-attack DPS late game, without losing most of your utility."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:25:04 2015 UTC,"Tyrande provides support by helping control the battle through stun, increased damage and her own sustain. She also can throw out a heal, which should be done pretty much on cooldown."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,folktronic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:46:31 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the good answer. If you want more than ""if you're good with her, play her"" then this is it : good yes, but need a healer and doesn't work in any comp.  Also, you should definitely be confident with a healer (Lili, Malf, Uther, Rehgar, Brightwing) before going into HL because you will probably need to fill the comp sometimes."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,henrax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"Try rolling Rehgar + Tyrande. Have Tyrande take Trueshot Aura and Rehgar take Bloodlust.    If you've got a coordinated and decently competent team, you'll absolutely melt faces in teamfights.    works best on maps like Battlefield or Sky Temple where there are concentrated areas for team fighting, and objectives that make enemies less likely to retreat"
NexusNewbies,3cc448,fanboyhunter,2,Tue Jul 7 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"When you play with a group of people that know the game, do you do well with her? If you do, then you're probably pretty much good to go.  I'm just over 30 but pretty decent at the game when I play with like minded players. I just started HL but it seems like if you work as a team and don't fight each other you'll do well.  The last game I played, we were able to do stupid stuff like get boss when the other team was all up. Win team fights on the boss and solo push lanes because we played well.  Unless you get into higher end games I don't think the hero matters much. And won't matter on your way there. The game is still new, enjoy going with what you think works. Just make sure you are doing research ok builds and maps, knowledge of maps is the most important part of the game."
NexusNewbies,3cc448,Spe333,2,Mon Jul 6 20:17:34 2015 UTC,You're going to be picking Tyrande a lot near the 4 & 5 slots. She's a great pick as a second heals and in response to an enemy channeler like Nazeebo or Lili.   You'll want to stay away from her if there's a strong melee assassin on the enemy team. Especially if you can't lock them down.  Look for the combo with Tyrande. Butcher is made for a combo with Tyrande.
NexusNewbies,3cc448,xaelra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:55:49 2015 UTC,"and in response to an enemy channeler like Nazeebo or Lili.   Li Li's channel is one where she moves, so hitting her with Lunar Blaze isn't that easy. The vast majority of Nazeebos take Gargantuan, these days."

Puffer fish and slime to zone people out.  Suicide bombing and using bubble to draw out cool-downs away from other heroes.  Murky may not be a brawler, but he can contribute a great deal to a team fight."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,bsmntdwlr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kinda what I'm doing too if I'm teamfighting, running around, pufferfishing, repeatedly sliming people and bubbling out when I'm in danger. I found that the +20% speed talent combined with the slime slow also makes for great chases."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,bu22dee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"Split push is always a good idea. In ranked you should be flexible. Sometimes it is not necessary to fight an objective, for example when you are the weaker team. so this is situational. your team should never take a fight what it can not win. so if there are going 4v5 it is there fault but in case you want to win the game you should join them (maybe they wait for you, before they attack) because team fights are necessary to get an advantage when fighting for the objectives later on."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,PopEffingTart,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:02 2015 UTC,So the idea is that I should trust my team not to full engage in a 4v5?
NexusNewbies,3cas79,Spe333,2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:27 2015 UTC,You should communicate with them and let them know you are staying or want to stay. You shouldn't expect them to do anything without communication.
NexusNewbies,3cas79,bu22dee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"Communication is key.  Typically, everyone joins team fights. So if you aren't, let them know why.  Also, check out the team comp. you might have the stronger team, and the only reason they lose is because it's 4v5. (Like they need you to stand on the temple, collect flowers or get the tribute)  But I've never played murky or had someone play him on my team. I just know how he plays and why I would ""need"" him to do something out of character."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,sStarz1779,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:34:48 2015 UTC,"in a best case scenario, yes.  but this wont happen very often maybe when you are rank 10 or higher."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,Nyxia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"Murky is so good at team fights. Octograbbing a target out of position instantly makes it a 5v4. Then all you do is continually annoying everyone by sliming and auto attacks and puffer fishing. You can even body block with your bubble!  However the best way to use Murky is to 1v1 another hero, taking them out of the fight before it even happens"
NexusNewbies,3cas79,N8CCRG,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"With Murky I just play to be as annoying as I possibly could be, I put my egg as close as possible to the middle of the map (while still being safe about it), then I just push my lane while being as aggressive as I can to whoever I'm against, but I try not to die any more than necessary. I head to objectives as they pop up and help my team take merc camps and just go back to pushing lanes asap, and when time for teamfighting comes, I just communicate with them - if they're competent and can handle it without me I just keep pushing but if it seems like they could use a bit of help I head there and usually try to walk around them to take out one of their assassins as the teamfight begins. Puffer is a FANTASTIC zoning tool, almost like a baby version of KTs phoenix as most people try to get out asap when you put it down and if they underestimate it, well, that's their bad. The slime damage really adds up too. So yeah, I would personally say go and participate in teamfights, you can do a lot of damage and be extremely annoying and try to bait their ults/cc with your bubble too."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,aWildTinoAppears,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"I also just bought Murky, and also am winning more than losing. But I apparently am having the opposite problems. When it gets to team fights and stuff, I'm great at disrupting and messing things up and giving my team a huge advantage. But when it's 1v1 or 1v2 in lane at the beginning of the game, I might as well not be there. I can't even get near the minions because just a couple shots from Valla or some other ranged hero and I'm bubbling out. I can't get in to slime or attack, and my pufferfish gets shot down right away.  What's your secret?  As to the team fight stuff, I think that's where Murky is best. Your job is to be annoying. You toss a fish, run and drop a slime, and once you get to level 10 the Octograb is amazing at sniping opponents (you just have to use it when you have teammates nearby to burst them down). Eventually, your abilities get to do a whole lot of damage. Living the Dream, plus Wrath of Cod, plus Slimy Pufferfish, plus your own slimes means serious damage output."
NexusNewbies,3cas79,ChupacabraPlus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"I've only lost my lane once and that was against a Valla, she kept on shooting my pufferfish and if I went in to harass I simply died after bubbling.  But apart from that game I don't think I've ever lost a lane, what I do is stay at range, then throw in the pufferfish in the middle of the minions so that if it explodes it damages the whole wave. When I throw it in I also go in with murky to try and slime the whole wave, and if the enemy champ tries to attack the pufferfish you go and damage him, then he has to choose, either attack the fish and get free dmged by you, or attack you and let the fish explode. Either scenario is a win but best case is of course that the puffer explodes. I usually bubble out after every confrontation. I use the puffer only when there are minions that I can kill with it, as I think that's its strength. Oh and make sure to get the rejuvenation heart after every wave, it heals for so much on murky."

NexusNewbies,3ccot3,levinho,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:32:09 2015 UTC,I'm in that boat.  My HL mmr is much much higher than my QM mmr due to all the matches I goofed off in during beta.
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,xaelra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:34 2015 UTC,I'm in that same situation for QM. But HL I did most of my games with a full team when I was just starting out. The entire team was new so we were matched up with some pretty high end opponents and lost a lot. Now that I'm playing solo I'm winning a lot more but it's mostly due to my low MMR in HL. And my MMR isn't rising quickly because I lost so many games.
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,henrax,2,Wed Jul 8 22:23:15 2015 UTC,"The matchmaking is based on a hidden mmr. So that either means that you have a high mmr of that they have a low one. So don't worry, they are probably not better than you."
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,maldrame,2,Mon Jul 6 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm kinda ruining games for other people because my understanding of match ups and heroes abilities outside of the free rotation is basically 0.   Level 40 itself is not a sufficient measure of this set of knowledge either.  Account levels and hero levels are simply grind meters.  One can technically grind their way to the top just by playing practice mode.  Hell, one can technically grind their way to level 40 in real pvp, but still learn little or nothing from their environment as they go.  As such, the matchmaking system does not take any of those variables into account.  It only cares about the number of games won and games lost.  Don't worry about what you do and do not know at the moment.  Just try to grow as you go."
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,bsmntdwlr,2,Tue Jul 7 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, Account level, hero level and master skins are a measure of time played, not skill at or knowledge of the game."

If you won a lot early it could have rapidly moved you up above your skill level which can happen if you get really lucky right off the bat.
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,TheVolatileExplosion,0,Tue Jul 7 01:43:52 2015 UTC,I would say it's because your hidden mmr is currently pretty high. Also I have been told that the matchmaking system in HotS is not the best so it might be a part of that as well.
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,levinho,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:26:29 2015 UTC,I think that there's two different issues here.  One is the ability to match players skill. The other is to match together viable comps.  Most times I think the big failure of the game is matching uneven comps.
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,TheVolatileExplosion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:29:00 2015 UTC,The only way they could make it so all the comps are the same would be to force like 1 support 1 tank 1 specialist and 2 assassins. The bad thing about that though is it would mess with queue times and no one really wants that.
NexusNewbies,3ccot3,levinho,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"Well,  you're right.  Queue times are important but you assume that implementing some comp bans would actually harm queues.

NexusNewbies,3ccot3,TheVolatileExplosion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ya they could do that, I just don't think it would work out that great unless they had a different queue for specific team comps."
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,iDingo91,8,Mon Jul 6 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"For starters, read this guide here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/NexusNewbies/comments/38u7lp/how_each_hero_behaves_a_playerbuyers_guide/  A lot of people will say this: don't buy heroes right away. Level up the free rotation heroes until 5 so you get more gold and get a feel for each hero. By the time the rotation ends, if you feel like you miss playing said hero go ahead and buy it."
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,m_takeshi,2,Mon Jul 6 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"Some heroes are better than the rest. But this objective superiority only comes into play at pretty high levels of play: until then, you are much more valuable with a hero you know how to play than with a hero that is objectively good. As such, you should be strongly encouraged to play the characters you enjoy playing and get better with them.  Also, it is normally suggested that you don't rush into buying heroes. As a new player, your priority should be in exposing yourself to as many heroes as possible, so that you see how they play and what their strenghts/weaknesses are. Normally, that is achieved by playing each character to lvl 5, which will also award you with 500g. (Plus, keep in mind that the cheapest heroes are most often in the free rotation. So even if you don't buy Raynor, you should be able to play him soon again.)"
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,Captain_Haile,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"Assuming that champs he enjoys playing with are also ones he is good at playing with.  Just saying that some characters are fun enjoyable to play, but that doesn't mean we're good with them. (Aba, nova...)"
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,Spe333,2,Mon Jul 6 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"Actually Raynor is at the lower end of the assassins. If you liked ranged assassin, Valla would be a better choice for the same price. What Raynor doesn't have is an ability to escape from enemies. Which is very important for the squishy assassins.  If you are thinking in the long term, you can check out some tier lists on the web to get a view of what's good and what's bad. And buy heroes which are on the upper half. This guarantees you more success in the games.   Believe me, you're gonna fall in love with other heroes more than with Raynor. ;) For example with the mentioned Sylvanas.  But first of all as others said, you should gain some experience with as many heroes as possible to be able to decide who to buy."
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,BirosHS,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas is so fun on three-lane maps, esp Cursed Hollow. I just don't like her on two-lane maps because her ability to fight for objectives is hampered considerably.  Cursed Hollow I'll try to rush tributes and hide outside the kill area unless my team needs me. Then use the E to teleport in and pick off a weak assassin. The occasional Jaina or Valla caught on their own is an easy kill with a full combo.  However, two-lane maps like Battlefield of Eternity are difficult esp with a Nova or Zeratul bc the only place you are safe is with your team. Laning is hard and when immortals battle, you have to be super-vigilant looking for shimmer or you're dead before you know it.  Lane pushing is so strong though, so even if your team is iffy on objectives (like Tomb of the Spider Queen) you can still push an advantage by yourself and single-handedly prevent the webweavers from pushing. My two best Sylvanas comebacks are on Tomb where we had one or two fewer webweaver waves and still won because I pushed lanes far enough that one wave was enough to finish off a fort, keep, and core."
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,creamcityjw,3,Mon Jul 6 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"I just don't like her on two-lane maps because her ability to fight for objectives is hampered considerably.   Sylvanas's strongest map is Haunted Mines, you know."
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,tundranocaps,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"Another thing about Raynor, that you only realize after playing a lot, is that his Q having knock back makes it much less of an attack skill, and more useful as an escape or gank skill.  I would dream of a rework to that skill to make it either slow, or have a short stun, that would likely be OP tho."
NexusNewbies,3cb8uk,xceph,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:54:16 2015 UTC,You are correct about falling in love with other heroes. Sylvanas is so fun to play. I just got her to level 4 last night after 3 or 4 games. Once I get her to level 5 though (hopefully tonight if I'm not busy) I will try another hero tonight. I also saw that I already owned Valla for some reason. Had to look it up and I forgot that I got her with a Diablo 3 pre-order. Woot! Hooray for free hero! I might be trying her next after getting Slyvana to level 5.

Zero mention of how I encourage new people to the game to not follow tier lists, play who they enjoy, try new builds, explain when to fight, when not to fight, importance of soaking, when to jungle, counter picks, list goes on and on but most of all have fun with the game.

You always answer my questions right away and take requests from viewers, as well as playing with them.   I almost quit playing a hero because I didn't know wtf I was doing with it.

NexusNewbies,3c72cq,Odoakar,10,Sun Jul 5 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"These aren't necessarily things that will help you to win, but rather to help you to get back into QM.  The only real way to increase your win % is to get back into QM.     Play a couple against the AI to wind down a bit, then get back into QM when you're feeling better.   Switch up your heroes and roles.  You'll feel less bad at a loss when it's not your main, and you can see things from different perspectives.  You might even find a hero you like more than your main.   Watch some youtubes or streams.  I recommend the youtuber MFPallyTime.  You'll see how others play, get some tips on what you can do with your hero, and some ideas for maps. Watch your replays.  Something that looked obvious may have been a bad idea in a replay.  While watching the replay, just keep asking yourself if what you're doing was the best thing you could be doing at that time.  If it wasn't, figure out how you can do it better next time."
NexusNewbies,3c72cq,siegeszug,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"U/seigszug nailed it. Try to play a lot of different hero's and roles to find out all of their strengths and weaknesses. Try it get all the free rotation heroes to level 5 so that you can get a feel for them and get some sweet, sweet gold."
NexusNewbies,3c72cq,Daniel3_5_7,8,Sun Jul 5 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"For Heroes, there are three really big rules: Don't die, soak a lot of XP, and go to objectives when at all possible. As you play more, you'll find caveats, but for now, focus on these three things. You want to keep lane presence (i.e. don't take a lot of damage and have to hearth as an objective spawns or hearth and leave the lane unsoaked) early game, then try to corral your team into grouping for the mid/late game after level 10.  I strongly second the recommendation that you watch your replays! If you have come from SC2, you have likely heard how important this is for improvement in that game, as well. If you got totally stomped in a game, don't worry about watching that replay because the problem is likely obvious. But if you had a close loss or a good win, check that replay out and see what happened over the course of the game. Look for mistakes in your own play, don't worry about what your teammates did aside from obvious observations. Spend your energy looking at your own play and how you can improve. And see what you did right, too. Do more of what you did right.  It may be that you are new enough at Heroes that you are, at first, not sure exactly what you're seeing -- not sure how long you've been playing. But go into each replay asking yourself some questions:   Did I soak my lane as well as I could, given the circumstances? Did I minimize my deaths? Did I respond to pings? Did I regularly check my minimap and pay attention to what was going on a couple inches off my screen? Did my team reach level 10 at the same time as or ahead of the other team? Did my team avoid a teamfight over an objective when we were nine and they were 10? Did I avoid picking poor fights (e.g. diving in in an obvious 4v5)? Did I attempt objectives when it was appropriate? (This means: I didn't suicide over an objective I could not have gotten. I didn't ignore the objective when it was obtainable. I didn't show up too early and die before the team could arrive. I didn't check the minimap to see if it was worth stalling, if capable, with a ranged attack before backup could arrive.)   As you watch your replays, you'll see that some of these questions may not be helpful and others you come up with on your own are more helpful. But you just wanna get in the mode of, What can I do to improve? As you spend more time with the game and recognize obvious mistakes, it's important to not let those observations hold you back from continued progress. You don't want to be the guy blaming the team for a bad play or complaining in party chat that the game was totally winnable if only the Sylvanas wasn't so bad. When you see others' mistakes, look at it as a, ""Okay, that was bad, I should not do that in the future"" moment of learning, rather than, ""UGH, too heavy, there's nothing I can do to win this game or learn from this match.""  [edit: Also, consider checking out a website like heroesfire.com or hotslogs.com to get an idea of builds you can use. Not to cookie-cutter them, but to get a general grasp of the Heroes and some ideas to work with. Some talent picks are not self-evident in their strength, so it can be helpful to see a guide or website explain why some are valuable, in what context you use others, etc.  Furthermore, track your progress! Note when you are improving. Catch yourself about to make a mistake that you would have made a week ago, then don't make that mistake and feel proud that you have improved!]  Also, like others have said, do not wear yourself out playing! I limit myself to three losses in a row, then I take a break. If I had a particularly bad loss -- a raging nerd or an afking troll -- then I stop right there. The longer you keep queuing into losses, the more hopeless it's going to feel. You won't be having fun or learning or improving, so what are you really accomplishing? It becomes masochistic, and not in a fun way! You want to be experiencing something meaningful when you do anything in life, especially if it's a hobby. Don't subject yourself to a bad time."

Don't go HAM, play conservatively. Do what the rest of the team is doing, even if it's stupid. Better to all focus the tank than focus no one. Thank teammates for helping little things like securing kills, landing stuns, and going back to defend lanes. When underlevelled, defend lanes. When lanes push out, go for camps. Level up free week heroes to 5, you'll learn so much about the game."

In addition to taking a break, or stretching or that... try changing your Hero up. If I find that I am being a little too aggressive, or I want to get into Team Fights a little more than I should... then I go with Johanna or a Hero that will let me get away with being a little more aggressive. If I find that I am not doing what I should... I look at how I am playing and find the best character to match that.   Sometimes it is less about how I feel and more about how I am playing that determines which character I go with."

NexusNewbies,3c72cq,Bullfinkle34,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:07:47 2015 UTC,What is helping me is go to hotslogs and upload your replays. Then look at your stats for each character. This will help you determine which ones you do the best with and which ones you don't do so great with. Then you can figure out why and then work on improving.

NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,SmokeSerpent,16,Mon Jul 6 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, early killing is the best way to deny experience from the enemy team. This is why early gank squads and roaming/rotations are so frequent in high level games.  Yes, it's useless by itself and you shouldn't overextend for them, but those kills are still important."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,kamimaiku,0,Mon Jul 6 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"Circling back about this ""high level games"" thing. I see and hear more furstration in QM and Hero League from players who clearly ""know what they want"" from watching high level streams, but don't know how to communicate it and expect the majority to have seen the same thing and know the ""patterns"" too. Maybe I'm crazy, but I think learning the mechanics of the game and evolving to meet them AND the evolving player knowledge as you rank up is going to be better AND more fun for anyone entering a new game."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Nyxia,-4,Mon Jul 6 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think on /r/NexusNewbies we are talking about high level team games with coordinated strategies for the most part. Yes if you have a systematic approach to it, it can be a strategy to keep the other team on their hearth, but this is definitely written more for the QM and 30-50 Hero League audience, where a game is far more often lost to people wasting time chasing than because we didn't gank enough."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Nyxia,5,Mon Jul 6 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"You don't even need some super top level coordination, just keep an eye on the map, communicate via pings and you're more or less good to go."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,amished,-3,Mon Jul 6 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"I can only speak from experience in +35 Hero League and QM, but I have never had a good experience with initiating or going along with a ""gank squad"" strategy there in pickup games. Better in /r/NexusNewbies to promote the basic mechanics here than high rank strategy, non?"
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Nyxia,4,Mon Jul 6 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Killing people in lane to deny the enemy team is a basic strategy, not high rank. You don't need a gank squad to do it, just being able to assess the situation - knowing what your hero is capable of, if you have anyone else to help you or no, who you're up against and so on. People come here to improve and being told to sit back and soak/take objectives until 10 and not capitalize on the opponent's mistakes is counterproductive to getting better at the game, imo."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Nyxia,2,Mon Jul 6 17:47:59 2015 UTC,"To build off your point, I'm level 15? And only started QM yesterday and had good luck with having a roaming zeratul come to my lane and I could move up and get a kill. It's something to keep in mind and there are benefits even if the gank makes them go back it's still a win overall."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,rrrrupp,-2,Mon Jul 6 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"When the overwhelming meta of the lower level play is people chasing for kills, I think it is productive to remind people that levels win the game.  Also capitalizing on people's mistakes by keeping them on the same lane while denying them xp is definitely part of what I said."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,rrrrupp,2,Mon Jul 6 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"You also said    If your enemy is overly aggressive and foolish you don't want to teach them that lesson.   I'd argue you most definitely want to teach them that lesson, you can just punish them by killing them and pushing your lane while they're gone. A lot of damage to towers and walls can be done in those seemingly few seconds it takes them to respawn and come back.   Edit: also on the psychological advantage front, a lot of times in lower rank play once you kill someone they'll start to play a lot more passively which can go in a few ways, for example if you play confidently you can pretty much zone them to the point where they'll be afraid to get in range of the minions to get xp or they'll make it extremely obvious when someone's coming to help them out to gank you and you know you should retreat (like, they play super passively and all of a sudden they start getting cocky and just start heading for you). Striking fear into the hearts of your enemies is underrated. Watching Azmodan turn around and run for safety at the sight of Murky is always great."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Rkynick,0,Mon Jul 6 18:13:34 2015 UTC,a lot of times in lower rank play once you kill someone they'll start to play a lot more passively   I've seen it go toward playing more aggressively in squads more often than I've seen it turn passive.
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Rkynick,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"Well, that's your experience, and mine is the complete opposite since I always play confidently even if I'm not entirely comfortable with the hero. So it's less of a PSA and more of a personal anecdote."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,fanboyhunter,6,Mon Jul 6 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"The bigger advantage is loss of EXP soak. If you hit level 10 while the enemy is still level 8, it's HUGE. I disagree with this PSA."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,RhazinHell,-2,Mon Jul 6 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"My main point is that, from what I see, kills do not equal as much exp advantage as pushing back and letting them retreat.  And you are right, getting ults before the other team is almost always a win at least in low rank play"
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Spe333,6,Mon Jul 6 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"They're both important.  Without a doubt, it's a good thing to zone out a hero from exp. However, outright killing a hero will zone out a hero for even longer and give you added exp.   I think your post has the right idea but I think you focus on the wrong thing. A better PSA would be... stop teamfighting before level 10. Too many groups will do an all out teamfight before level 10 over the stupidest (or sometimes for no reason) things. Fighting over a watchtower, just fighting in the middle of the lane for no reason, etc. It makes no sense and gains you very little while risking a lot."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,Eriennyl,3,Mon Jul 6 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think this is a very flawed position. You don't really lose exp from ganking instead of laning, the enemy minions will either die from your own minions & you'll be in range to get the exp (if you're ganking in-lane, you literally aren't losing anything since you're in exp range), or they'll still be there when you get back to laning and you won't have lost anything. Additionally, minion exp is single-counted so as long as one person is in range, you're fine-- which is why TLV strats (TLV soak all lanes, everyone else roams and ganks) are so effective (re: TLV winrate across all ranks).  If you can get an early level advantage by ganking (both denies enemy exp and gives you extra exp = creates an exp gap), that can be all the difference you need to secure an objective and start snowballing."
NexusNewbies,3cbbh3,henrax,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about ganking at all, I'm talking about individuals choosing to chase kills. If your team decides to team up and gank, that's a totally different proposition."

NexusNewbies,3c7yon,yoonarenita,5,Sun Jul 5 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"You should only solo merc camps if you can live through it without having to port back to heal. Gazlowe can solo camps really well as well as anyone with bribe. Valla can solo boss at 13 but only if you go with her auto attack build. Sylvanas can solo camps because they can't attack back. She just doesn't do a ton of damage so it might take awhile.    You should focus on lanes until you are level 10 or if you need to catch up on a level or two. Otherwise, focus the objective at the highest priority, but don't let your team trickle into it. Make sure everyone is close by and ready to go in. After level 10, you should generally stick together and rotate around the map for mercs, ganks, and objectives."
NexusNewbies,3c7yon,RogueT3ch,3,Sun Jul 5 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"It's quite situational. Basically go do mercs if you have nothing better to do. Things better to do are : map objectives, kill enemy heroes, getting xp if you need xp (so before lvl 10 and if you are behind). Some heroes are good to solo mercs, like Sylv, Illidan, Anub, Gazlowe, Sonya... So if you have them in your team let them do it or help them but don't go alone. It's good to get mercs before map objectives so the enemies can either defend and lose the objective or contest and maybe lose some buildings. Some situations where it's good to get mercs :     you just backed from a good push and everybody is recovering before next map objectives. Same if the enemy team just backed from a good push. If you managed to kill a couple of them and they are not back before a while then it's better to push back or to take a boss.  Your team is soaking on three lanes, nothing really happens and you have a good hero to do mercs. Especially just before objectives. It's where you can solo mercs. Just be careful of where the enemies are, and don't do it if it takes too much time (Sylv lvl 4 can solo siege in like 2 minutes, it's not worth it).  Half of your team is dead and you don't have anything else to do without a high risk of dying.   Note : Don't forget to push with your mercs, especially if it's the boss. They become so much more powerful.    Basically : before 10 you want at least one hero on each lane, after you want to be with your team. Of course if you have map objectives you can leave your lane but for example if you have a very good pusher (or the opposing team has one) it can be good to keep one hero on one lane. Since there is no gold, xp is everything in this game so it's never a bad thing to get more than your opponents. Some heroes like Murky, Gazlowe or Asmodan can be more useful if they are never with their team. Nova and Zeratul (even Kerrigan) can also be roaming late game, especially if your team is ahead. But most of the time, being alone after lvl 16-20 is very dangerous and should be avoided. When you lane alone, it's very rare that you kill buildings, just clean the minion waves and don't get too deep unless you know you're safe. Once again some heroes can push alone (basically most specialists) but they are not the norm.   It can be different on different maps, like on Backheart's Bay you don't really have a laning phase. But you still want to get the xp from the minions as much as possible, especially before level 10 (but it is always true throughout the game).  Everything I said is obviously situational so everything is wrong in certain situations. But these are some basic rules and I think it's a good start."
NexusNewbies,3c7yon,henrax,3,Sun Jul 5 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"When should you solo a merc camp?  If at all possible, never. Anything that a good merc camper can achieve solo can be achieved faster, safer, and more efficiently with a buddy or two.  Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should.    But if you must, follow these order of operations.  1) You know exactly where all your opponents are located and are in no way in danger of getting ganked.  2) You aren't needed by the team in some other location (like an objective).  3) You aren't needed in lane.  4) You can actually push with the mercs rather than just abandon them (an exception exists for the next rule).  5) An objective is about to pop and you can still make it to the objective after claiming the camp, causing your opponents to abandon either the objective or the mercs.  Who should solo a merc camp?  Again, if possible, no one.  But if we want to be technical we can rate proficiency vs mercs with three parameters: can they stay safe, can they take the camp quickly, and can they take the camp without expending substantial resources?  Safety: If you must burn all chances of escape and survival in order to secure a camp, you severely increase the success rate of an incoming gank.  Merc camps are valuable, but your hero is more valuable.  Similarly, if you are forced to take substantial amounts of damage in order to take the camp, even if you could escape a gank, you're equally unsafe.  You might escape a gank, but you'll also have to return to base before any major encounter or you'll be at a disadvantage.  Quickness: There are heroes that can take the camp safely, but they'll take forever to do it.  Time is money, friend.  The longer you spend taking the camp the less you're helping your team. A proficient hero can carve out a merc camp in short order.  Fifteen seconds at maximum, I'd say.  That's not a lot of time when you think about it.  Maybe 2 full skill rotations?  Valla's Multishot has an 8 second cooldown, to put it in perspective.  You have that much time.  Efficiency: Health and Mana are valuable.  Anyone can buy a merc camp with most of their health bar and half of their mana.  But that also gives the other team an easy gank opportunity, and if not ganked they'll need to return to base or burn a well before they're in any shape to join their team again.  A good merc camper can stay at full mana and nearly full health through the whole business.  Better yet, they don't need to use an ult either.  Valla can burn down a bruiser camp with Strafe and it's a very efficient process concerning her health and mana.  But she also wasted an ultimate on some mercs.  That's a net loss in value.  Safe, Quick, and Efficient.  That's what you're shooting for.  No health loss, 15 seconds to take the camp, and the ability to survive if things get rough.  Heroes who can do this are broken down into two groups: those that need a particular talent build to make it happen, and those that can do it independent of build.  Gazlowe, Zagara, Sonya, and Nazeebo, are all very competent at soloing a camp independent of build.  Illidan, Kerrigan, Johanna, Hammer, Valla, Anub'Arak, Azmodan, and Sylvanas can make it happen with the correct build.  I may have missed a few, and if so I apologize, I haven't attempted to try every variety of merc-worthy build on every character.  Nonetheless, all other characters should stay away from soloing camps.  And again, even the aforementioned characters do better with a friend.  Just because they can solo, doesn't mean they should.  Any amount of safety, quickness, or efficiency the provide is improved with a friend in tow."
NexusNewbies,3c7yon,maldrame,2,Sun Jul 5 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"I use characters with bribe on the two person camps. Also the new three person, bribe two, kill one. When I have azmodan and my demon army ultimate then I can also solo the camps of four or five. Only do it when you can be quick and get away safe.

NexusNewbies,3c7m07,Leviruz,3,Sun Jul 5 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"Cool!   I am going to assume Tyradin can be either Tyreal or Tyrande.   So you listed Illidan (Melee Assassin), Muradin (Melee Warrior), and Tyreal (Melee Warrior) or Tyrande (Ranged Support)   With that kind of lineup, I would recommend Zeratul (Melee Assasin), it sounds like you like to be in the action and Zeratul is your hero to look at. Nova is great, but requires a lot of patience and waiting... and you don't stay too long in the fight.   I'd go with Zeratul first, and wait until you start digging more ranged heroes, then go for Nova."

As for the characters in question: keep in mind that Muradin will probably be available every 3 weeks as part of the free rotation.

NexusNewbies,3c6cmn,mcandre,4,Sun Jul 5 06:43:00 2015 UTC,"I would say that yes some maps are harder to come back from than others. A lot of people have talked about this in the community too. The biggest culprit of snowballyness is the Haunted Mines. Matches are usually much shorter and much quicker and your mistakes are punished a lot more frequently. Tomb of the Spider Queen can favor momentum but can turn around even as late as an enemy core push. Some people say the Battlefield of Eternity is snowbally like the mines but I have yet to play it competitively so I'll withhold judgement though I mentioned based on the ptr the choke points and crevices could favor the cunning and bring comeback ambushes into play.   For all other maps I've only ever been snowballed when I had an uncooperative teammate or someone who deliberately got mad and threw a match and even then I almost won a few of them regardless. On the Sky Temple I had a match where two people threatened to afk right off the bat because we had no warrior and the enemy team did and even when they played because another teammate said they'd report them if they quit, we had a long, close match where we only lost when the triple temples spawned which is a pretty good holdout for an uncooperative team.  I think the main thing people don't get is that the game is hardly over based on the first teamfight/objectives/what have you. The first objectives are very weak and it's easy to take 2 bombardments, curses, temple steals, etc and win the match. As for teamfights, there are characters who are very weak earlygame but their power is in the lategame, Thrall, Falstad and a few others come to mind. Some characters totally change in threat level and power just on getting their ult alone. I would say that your map is only part of the factor, your team comp is another, how well your team plays versus them is another. Any of the three can help make or break your match. I've won unwinnable matches and lost unloseable ones, so I never say it's over until the core is destroyed on either side."

I've had matches where the highest deaths are the ""unkillable"" Johanna, or matches where Stitches was the mvp of the team or other ""unlikely"" scenarios. As long as you're playing a hero you love and having fun, what does it matter? If you want to quit before a game even starts because of a come-as-you-are qm comp then you owe it to the people you qm with to either get a premade ready or not pug it up. I agree with you 100%. The best hero in the game could be terrible in your hands, or the ""worst"" character just instinctively made for you/a god in your hands."

NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,Stormzilla,8,Sun Jul 5 01:14:23 2015 UTC,Nah you did right by Anub'arak. He's always been a disruptive high damage warrior (Sonya should be like this and I'm sad she's not). He's not a main warrior like Muradin or Johanna.   Ask yourself these questions:  *Did I create opportunity for my team to get kills?  *Did I save my team by peeling for them or disrupt high damage from happening to my team or prevent high healing from happening to the enemy team?  *Did I fees the enemy any kills?  *Did I miss any team fights?   *Did I start any fights when my team wasn't in a position to win?  *Did I ping my intentions enough to get my team to understand what I was going for?

NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,iwearatophat,3,Sun Jul 5 15:45:43 2015 UTC,Without seeing the game hard to say.  Talent choices were alright.  My biggest gripe with pug warriors has always been their tendency to play like they are assassins.  They dive the enemy backline and start going after squishies.  That leaves your backline in an awkward position; they can either leave you overextended and not follow up your dive which sucks for the warrior or they can extend up to you putting themselves squarely in the enemy's frontline which the warrior just dove behind which sucks for them.  Most choose that 2nd option and then immediately have to start kiting instead of damaging because the enemy frontline goes at them unimpeded.
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,SnipingBeaver,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:03:51 2015 UTC,"Playing Anub, I definitely am wary of going too deep into the enemy's line, and almost never use burrow to initiate. I feel like that was not an issue. Thanks for responding."
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,maldrame,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:46:38 2015 UTC,I definitely feel like burrow is best used if they try to disengage the fight or if someone starts channeling and your Q is on cd.
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,kirolm,3,Mon Jul 6 06:53:35 2015 UTC,"It isn't Anub'Arak's job to sponge-tank.  He has less health than any other warrior, and even less than certain characters from other categories.  Technically speaking, Uther and Rehgar are both better in-the-face spongetanks than Anub.  Furthermore, he has great ranged control and can affect games without getting right in the thick of all things.  So yeah, you're right, he shouldn't just stand there and get hit.  I mean, no tank should do that, regardless of how much survival they can pack.  But it might be reasonable to say Anub least of all should engage in sponging.  On the other hand, so long as you watch your position and don't do something as silly as burrow yourself into the center of the entire opposing team, Anub has really phenomenal aggressive control.  It takes an attentive set of assassins at his back to make it shine, but when you do have offensive support it's possible to heavily punish any opponent who dares to get close to your team.  You can even shred up their front line to great effect without putting yourself in a lot of danger.  Choosing between the two strategies is dependent on both team and situation, so you can't simply dedicate to one or the other.  But if you have a team that seems willing to dive in behind you- especially if they're willing to dive, burst, and back out with you- it's perfectly acceptable to ditch the concerns of whether or not it's practical to sponge with Anub.  It may feel risky, and will at some point backfire on you, and sometimes you will certainly have to play it smart and deny your teammates their aggressive tendencies, but that doesn't mean it's always a bad idea.   One last note, both the guys critiquing me finished with double digit deaths, and I recently got Anub to his Master Skin (with the aid of a stimpack and the launch bonus...so its not totally legit). I feel like they, in fact, may have been the bad ones, but they got me questioning my play nonetheless.   Don't base expectations of skill on a skin.  One can farm a master skin entirely vs AI.  They showcase time and dedication, but not skill.    Additionally, and I mean this as a more broad statement, not as something to strictly apply to your anecdote, try not to ask the question, ""were my teammates opinions worth disregarding?""  That's a red herring.  Instead ask yourself, ""How much of their commentary could have been correct?""  Even in the event that those teammates don't understand the best way to utilize your character (as will often happen), the possibility still remains that you don't understand the best way to utilize theirs either.  On my own end I frequently feel bewildered that my teammates are willing to engage certain in tactics, but find that if I'm willing to go along with their insanity we can still come out on top.  I do the same while watching streams on twitch: first I am baffled that the streamer would commit themselves to a suicidal tactic, and second I become baffled that everything works in their favor.    Granted, not everything a teammate tells you to do is correct.  That should go without saying.   And especially as they become more toxic it's less likely that they're thinking correctly about their own hero's playstyle.   Nonetheless not all tactics are incorrect because they aren't your primary style.  And the golden rule is to always help your team, because you achieve more together in a bad idea than you do separated on good ideas."
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,fanboyhunter,2,Sun Jul 5 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"If you're going beetle build, attack scarabs probably give you more bang for your buck regen wise than regen master unless you were farming two lanes with the help of your team, something I really doubt was going on in a pickup game. However, this -is- a more damage oriented build with some sustain, as opposed to just a ridiculously tanky Anub. Playing him Beetle isn't playing him wrong, but you are more fragile and if your team was expecting tank Anub, they're going to overextend a lot.  To me, Tank Anub looks more like... Persistent Carapace (for the longer shield), Superiority (for fighting under towers or defending against boss/plant/DK), Shed Exoskeleton (for a lot more positioning + long shields for decent escape while burrow is on CD), Web Blast (to put the enemy assassin out of commission so you can tank the rest of the team), Chitinous Plating (to give your Locust Swarm a chance to kick in and make that shield worthwhile), Imposing Presence or Blood for Blood depending on their assassins, and Hardened Shield. So you can run in, pop your shield, move around fast to body block or chase or pressure or set up kills, you can remove heroes from the fight for a while, you can take all the focus in the world with hardened shield + shield and use Locust Swarm to heal back up despite focus fire. But you won't be doing a lot of damage, and will have to rely a lot more on your team doing the killing."
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,XKDVD_on_Twitch,2,Sun Jul 5 09:16:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for info on the tankier build. Considering our team comp that game, it probably would've been the better option. Gonna keep that in mind for the future."
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,kirolm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"yep, you should be building for shields over beetles. and burning rage isn't a good pick. Anub is great for peels. Make sure you're using your Q smartly and not just whenever it's available. E is a great tool for inserting yourself between the enemy and your ally to absorb damage.    I can't say too much without seeing your replay though"
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,XKDVD_on_Twitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"Can I critique that build a little?   I don't think persistent carapace is very useful. When in the heat of battle, the shield is going to get worn down before the cooldown anyway- sometimes even if just fighting minion waves. Regeneration master is going to give you WAY more sustain. If you just kill the wizard in each minion wave first, you'll start seeing those stacks add up in no time.   I personally like getting legion of beetles plus leeching scarabs at 4/7, but your picks there are definitely useful. I'll actually try that out depending on who I'm playing against.  The rest of your picks are the same as what I would do with one small exception. I pick hardened shield when I feel like I'm lacking in sustain, but I like rewind since anub's cooldowns are so long, and with rewind you can pump out a ton of CC/stuns in a very short time.   Definitely check out regeneration master though, it changed my opinion on anub's tankiness considerably."
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,kirolm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"The longer cooldown isn't necessarily for the shield, as much as it is for the speed buff while having the shield if you are running away.  Regen master gives more sustain, but you need to farm it with your team, which is difficult in soloq. If you are just farming your lane, so one orb every minion wave, it is a lot more lackluster.  Legion / Leech is half of a beetle build, and I think that it's not so useful as to outlive a long hard shield + Hardened Shield when compared to a full beetle build with something like Locust at 20.   Rewind is an offensive choice, and it's awesome if you have another warrior or a tanky support on your side, but if you are literally the only thing on your frontline that isn't wafer thin, you need to be in there and Hardened Shield helps you do that a lot better than having 2 extra stuns."
NexusNewbies,3c5nhx,XKDVD_on_Twitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"Persistent carapace doesn't give you a speed buff. Shed exoskeleton gives you a speed boost for a flat three seconds, it doesn't matter if you have a shield or not.   The reason I take those two beetle talents is because being surrounded in beetles absorbs a lot of skill shots which helps avoid damage and sometimes CC, and the heal gives you that little kick of sustain, and I don't feel like the other talents in that tier are particularly useful in teamfights anyway, but depending on matchup I don't always choose them.   And yes that is what I said about how to choose the last talent, we're in agreement here. Just don't forget that if you have four aoe stuns, you can usually kill off the enemies before even taking damage."

First few minutes are usually the least important in the game and you can quite safely just soak experience until AFKer joins or is replaced by an AI. It is can be very annoying, but usually you can work around it a bit.  Going AFK several times a game should be reported though and I'd just classify it as harrasment (they are costing your team time and effort in losing battle) or cheating (they get XP for playing while not playing.)"

Nova isn't just about securing kills or waiting for low health enemies, sometimes you want to harass them back to spawn or their fountain so they lose lane xp.  Third, yeah she's not completely invisible and I personally don't mind that. It makes it more of a challenge to roam around on Nova, especially if your enemies can see shimmers. Also, when you're playing against her, it gives you a counter besides just playing paranoid. The stealth mechanic in general is fine as is. It rewards the observant and punishes tunnel vision."

NexusNewbies,3c4amd,Dreadtle,4,Sat Jul 4 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"Your next 10k gold won't come nearly as fast as this 10k. I wouldn't recommending going all in on a 10k hero yet.  If you are looking to just get new heroes to experience different playstyles, malf and muradin are excellent heroes overall, and amazing for their 2k price tags. Lili is also pretty good, and ETC is kinda fun if you like tankier heroes. I like Raynor, but his kit is pretty boring; and if you're bored with Valla this probably isn't the direction you want to go.  Anub at 4k is another great buy. And all of the other 4k heroes are pretty solid.  Johanna is a brick wall of a tank and great in certain comps, but can't really get in and do alot of damage or generally vary playstyle, if that's what you want to do any particular game. The Butcher is much stronger with a support watching him and a tank peeling for him, and is very dependent on the comp of both teams. Sylvy, like all 3 of the heroes you listed is without a doubt a good hero, but basically has one optimal build you're gonna want to take, and might not give you the variety of play you want.  When your only hero is valla, It just seems to me like you get so much more out of 3 or 4 of the really good, lower cost heroes. Another option is a starter bundle, if you can justify spending the money. They are a great value if you don't already have the heroes."
NexusNewbies,3c4amd,jmknsd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:17:35 2015 UTC,Well if you're looking for more of the same (you mentioned Valla) then Sylvanas is enough of a change to what you're used to that you'll stay satisfied with your purchase. The others you're looking at will be a wild change to what you're used to and the risk of buyer's remorse increases greatly.   That being said: if you don't like Valla - buy one of the others.

NexusNewbies,3c4amd,Goobah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"The only similarity between Sylvanas and Valla is that they are both ranged. Sylvanas does not do nearly as much DPS, but she does excel at pushing lanes very efficiently. She's damn near broken on some maps as well. She's a great hero, but don't be mistaken with the comparisons to Valla.   Johanna is the purest form of a tank in the game (Muradin is up there as well). She just doesn't die. If you want a change of pace and want to just get up in people's shit and bully those squishys around, then get her and never look back.   I would hold off on the Butcher for the time being. It seems like people have already realized how to play against him (immediately focus him down) and he isn't nearly as broken as people were whining about last week. If left unchecked, though, he can run over unsuspecting newer players."

We'd knock out 3 of them and before they got back had knocked out the other 2 and they never could contest us 5v5 again.

That means you won't be winning even fights of any kind, really, and you might even lose fights that are to your advantage unless played very well.  Your best bet is to soak. Control your side of the map. Grab mercs as a group so you can put some map pressure and give you some breathing room, de-push your own lanes to get that XP, if they are grabbing map objective as a group, go for something else. Boss, a couple of towers, anything that will give you XP or map pressure.   The biggest problem I see when you're at a level disadvantage is not just people playing badly, but rather, playing separately. Even bad ideas have a chance to work out if you do it with all 5 heroes at once. But they will never work out if your team is dying in 2s and 3s trying to make plays happen that even people who are amazing at the game wouldn't be able to make work. 2 talents is too big of a gap to do anything but damage control. Plus with the underdog XP bonus, you'll be able to catch up quickly, and if you do find someone super out of position, that kill can mean most of a level all on it's own later on in the game."

See if you can get them to get a little cocky and engage in a fight that is in your favor; they are split a little, a 4v5, they are in a narrow corridor, under your keep.  Anything like that can help a ton.  If you get a kill or two don't immediately overextend and chase.  They are still more powerful than you.  Take your win and start to apply lane pressure as a team.  If you can at least get to the same talent tier then you can engage.  16 to 19 is bad but doable.  17 to 20 is much harder because they have more talents than you.  Don't trickle into them.  This is the biggest one that I see all the time.  You get down a player or two and the people who are alive just kind of walk into the other team 1-2 at a time.  That is stupid.

I suspect as more heroes come out, more heroes are made cheaper, and players have longer to play, and Blizzard finishes fine-tuning gold acquisition (as with level 9 heroes now giving 750 gold), there'll be bans introduced. Bans are also not always as good when you're still trying to balance maps and heroes, as they can hide the problem you need to solve.  Also, 1 ban per team won't really do all that much if there's 1 OP hero, the 2nd team is forced to ban it. And if there are two, either each side bans one or neither bans any and each team gets one of each, and thus you don't get much out of bans. You really don't get the ""banning champions I'd rather not face,"" and if you have 2 bans per team, some roles have small enough pools (such as only 5 main healers in the game) that 2 bans per team can really impact what's available.

That build usually goes Comp arrows, Arsenal, Searing attacks, Strafe, Frost shot, Blood for blood, Bolt.  Recently however, i've been running her ""Q"" build pretty much every game. That build goes Siphoning arrow, puncturing arrow, repeating arrow, rain of vengeance, spellshield, Tumble, bolt.   Her Q build is insanely good at dueling/1v1'ing, and actually has incredible self heal/survivability.

Like seriously, go take siphoning arrow at level one and toss it at an enemy while you're still level one and have half hp, it's great healing comparatively.  There are 3 main reasons why the auto build isn't/should'nt really be used.    You are very unsafe doing it. Your enemy can hit tab and notice that literally all of your damage is coming from auto attacks, and thus play around that very very easily. The enemy muradin for instance can choose to jump on you and cut your attack speed in half. Your basic attack range is low enough pre nexus frenzy that many people can abuse your position. Damage output. If you go this build and get no opposition the whole game. Let's say it works for some reason. You'll get around the same damage as the Multishot build. That isn't worth the risk and that's only if you take Manticore, aka why everyone does.  The utility that the multishot and Q build are beyond just their burst. Q build has the best survivability available to valla along with having great damage. Multishot not only has great AOE, but a great AOE slow at level 13, which can be huge in teamfights. The thing is that nowadays, burst rules the game. It's better to be able to burst someone before they can burst you/burst them while they're cc'd than to be a walking DoT (AA build)."
NexusNewbies,3c180u,lesp811,3,Fri Jul 3 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say that if you get some more games with tanks played, and any healer other than Rehgar, you'd be looking good. Rehgar is your only healer with over 5 PvP games played, and you don't have a single tank (as opposed to any warrior, such as Tyrael), meeting that criteria, which could be an issue in HL.  My goal when I decide I want to prepare for HL would be to try and have at least 10 games with 10 heroes to make sure I'm ready. Is 10 a bit overkill? Perhaps, but definitely 5, and definitely try for at least 10 for one in each role."
NexusNewbies,3c180u,tundranocaps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:26:24 2015 UTC,OK that sounds smart. Now I own malf in addition to rehgar. Muradin/anub'arak/tyreal for tanks. How often do you end up getting stuck as warrior/support? Pretty common in low ranks?  I play league as well and it seems the higher you go in league the more support mains you find so its not uncommon to have support called.
NexusNewbies,3c180u,tundranocaps,3,Fri Jul 3 21:41:52 2015 UTC,"Depends. I like doing support/Warrior. It's not that I'm a better support than I am a DPS player, but that I'm a better support than the other players on my team are, and I may not be a better DPS than they are, or less of an ""upgrade"". The big issue with taking many supports in low Elo is that while you can make right decisions, you can't really act on them as well. It's less of a benefit in HotS anyway, with hard-carry being harder to do, but supports can still win games.  Muradin/Anub'Arak should do. Malfurion is good, yes, play a few more games with those heroes to beef up your selection if the other is taken. Tyrael is mostly when your team is pretty tanky/has another full tank."
NexusNewbies,3c180u,LeBigMac84,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:47:33 2015 UTC,Hijacking here for another question. What should a good team comp look like. What should I look for if I have to fill or last pick?
NexusNewbies,3c180u,TrevelyanISU,5,Fri Jul 3 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"This is always going to depend: On the map, on your team's picks, and on the picks of the opposing team as well.  A safe play is to try and have a warrior, a support, at least 2 assassins and a 5th either specialist, or another assassin, or even a bruiser (warrior built for dmg). But having this comp doesn't guarantee success because different heroes are stronger than others on certain maps, different heroes counter certain opposing heroes well, etc etc. I've seen the strangest comps steamroll ""ideal"" comps so it's difficult to say what the best pick at any given time might be."
NexusNewbies,3c180u,tundranocaps,2,Fri Jul 3 22:27:07 2015 UTC,"1-2 warriors, at least one of them should be a ""tank"", which means initiation/hard CC. 1-2 assassins, 0-1 specialists, 1 healer. An off-healer can go on top, but usually not replace.  1 Tank, 1 Healer, and the last 3 being DPS/specialists is usually good. You usually want one of the damage at least to be burst, and at least 1-2 heroes capable of wave-clear, and you want to make sure you don't have 4-5 melee champions.  It's more of a longer check-list of conditions, that varies by opponent picks too - if they have no healers, not having one as well isn't as bad, if all their heroes are melee, you're not losing as much by going all melee too - you won't gain the advantage you could've had, but you're not suddenly behind."
NexusNewbies,3c180u,fanboyhunter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you're well rounded in terms of understanding all the roles and heroes you have access to. Sometimes in draft pick you won't get to play your main characters.    Also, I recommend going into HL with some teammates you know are solid. My experience with solo queueing HL at rank 50 was that nearly every player I got matched with was absolute garbage.    Last night I joined with a premade and we steamrolled a few matches.    Also, keep in mind that HL is currently in preseason so it doesn't matter if you do a bit poorly. It's not like everyone will magically be better though, at least until you start climbing ranks. Then I think the main difference is that you just stop playing with people who aren't good."

NexusNewbies,3c12qy,N8CCRG,5,Fri Jul 3 23:06:41 2015 UTC,"I've been getting pretty into dota lately, after starting with hots, and I actually do like last hitting and denying.  It creates this interesting tug of war between you and your lane foe, and becomes a factor in decision making (do I harrass this guy out of lane and sacrifice some farm?  Or do I clear the wave and risk hin getting some gold?)."
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,Eryalus,2,Sat Jul 4 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it adds difficulty. I played league for 3 years and I hated it.

NexusNewbies,3c12qy,Tandoori_Pizza,2,Sat Jul 4 00:10:40 2015 UTC,"It creates more gameplay elements. You have to be at certain spots to last hit, which opens up opportunities for people to harass you, and makes the melee versus ranged lane dynamic much more pronounced than in a game where you can just sit half a screen from minions dying."
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,tundranocaps,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:17:59 2015 UTC,"It makes sense for experts, it basically measures lane control in situations where you are both cautious enough to actually be killed.  At that level, almost everybody hits near 100% of the last hits they can safely attempt, but lane control can allow you to safely attempt more than your opponent.      The problem is for the vast majority of players, farm becomes more about who is better at the last hitting PvE mini game."
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,5510,-1,Sat Jul 4 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"It just ups the skill cieling. Overall it makes for a richer and more drawn out lane struggle, but hots is kinda moba-lite. Nothing wrong with that though"
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,RobotVandal,5,Sat Jul 4 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"Last hitting isn't important here since it doesn't exist. In terms of hitting other players, you'll get the hang of just right clicking on another hero to attack. However, it's more useful to learn the A+Left click, which IIRC favors Heroes over minions."
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,Epicthunder25,2,Fri Jul 3 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Also, the auto-attack move is extremely useful for dealing with waves of minions while concentrating on other things such as minimap"
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,cyclistcow,2,Sat Jul 4 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"Last hitting is replaced by ""Soaking"" in this game. As you noticed, your team shares a level, and everyone on the team contributes experience towards that. When anyone is close enough to a minion as it dies, that person contributes xp to your team.   If you find yourself clicking minions over heroes...Stop A moving. People say this tactic is useful when in actuality it isn't at all in a team fight. Learning click accuracy with your right click is way better to do. I used to play ADC in league for a very long time, and playing the game ""OSU!"" helped me with this tremendously.  Funny you mention this game being clunky actually, League feels so disgustingly clunky after swapping to this game xD. (Source rank 1 ranged assassin player)"
NexusNewbies,3c12qy,EnvyHotS,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, no last hitting to bother with.

NexusNewbies,3c0tdv,TheMieberlake,8,Fri Jul 3 18:55:47 2015 UTC,"Level 10 Tassadar player here.  I'm by no means an expert, but he's one of my faves to play.  Tassadar has a couple of really great abilities in his kit, and a ridiculous amount of survivability.  Psi storm gives you zoning power, and at level 7, free crits on anything standing in it.  His shield is actually very powerful, and can be used to great effect on anyone in trouble.  Oracle saves lives.  Period.  Anytime you have a Nova or Zeratul on the enemy team, it should never be off of cooldown.  Dimensional shift is how you never let Tassadar die.  Spec into Prescience and Dimensional Warp if you want some hilarious Benny Hill themed chases that take at least one of the enemy team out of the fight for a while.  Archon makes Tassadar into a killing machine.  It amplifies all his abilities and he becomes a monster for teamfights, pushing, etc.  He can solo lane with Psi Storm, as long as he stays back and doesn't try to bully too much.  In teamfights, just float around the edges dropping Psi Storm and shields as appropriate, with the occasional AA burst on enemies out of position.  Feel free after 16 to dive a little just to get the attention of one of their dps and see if they'll chase you; if so you've got shift and its auto-use to kite them for days while dropping Psi Storm for them to run through.  I recommend building him with:  Conjurer's Pursuit (or Psi-infusion on shorter maps), Promote (though not as strongly after the nerf), Static Charge, Archon, Prescience, Dimensional Warp, and Twilight Archon.

Though it should be noted that you can try to spec for healing if you have none on your team, or spec for detection if their Nova/Zeratul combo is wrecking"
NexusNewbies,3c0tdv,maldrame,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"Tassadar is one of those examples where they archetype naming breaks down.  Is he a support?  Well, technically yes.  He has support abilities (shield and vision).  But he also has a very potent aoe and some great autoattack bonuses.  In application we tend to call Tass and his ilk (currently Tyrande as well) a secondary support.  You wouldn't want them as the primary support character.  They don't quite have the healing uptime for that.  But they make fantastic support sidekicks.  A little defensive bonus here, a little offensive bonus there, a decent amount of damage to round it off.    I'm not a Tass player by heart, so I can't speak to all his nuances, but in general you want to build him according to your team.  If you're the only support, grab a few extra support spells.  If your team is weak on push and wave-clear, spec into his psi storm for the extra PvE control.  If you're fighting Zeratul or Nova, spec into his vision talents to shut them down.  And so forth and so on."

If you die as a warrior then its not always a case of you have a bad healer, similarly if you die as a healer its not always because no one was keeping an eye on you. Whether AI, QM or HL you will have teams that just naturally click and work well together, you will have teams that work terribly and seem to get chewed up from the first minute; occasionally you get two teams that seem pretty balanced in terms of team work and competency.  I say this because you shouldn't let trying your hand at HL be put off by concern for letting the team down... that's presuming that everyone playing HL is great and knows what they're doing... they really dont. Especially in the first tier 50 - 40 (where losing matches doesn't result in losing HL rank points) you find that a lot of people don't know about team composition, they don't know how to play a wide selection of characters/roles well. You can spot these players as even when the first three people on a team might have picked Assassins, they'll still pick their Assassin character that they flagged up first because that who they want to play regardless of whether it makes the team stronger.  So just play and don't sweat it, you'll get better slowly, you'll advance into the bigger leagues against players who know what they're doing at the same pace as you start to know what you're doing."

NexusNewbies,3bzump,HyoyeonFan,3,Fri Jul 3 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"I was going through the same recently, and the way i managed to do it and get a bit more rank climbing was by:   improving my micro, which means practice, practice practice!!! Best start is on try mode, practice micro offensive, and defensive, repositioning out of aoes, etc watching videos of the hero i was playing, not focusing on the fight/comentators so much, but instead on the individual moves, rotations(spell order) and positioning of that said hero. Like for example seeing where the jaina was in relation to the tank, when does she dive and move in and when she stays a bit more back, against what sort of heroes and comps. improving my situational awareness, by setting a timer every 30 seconds and take a quick look at the map and glance what is happening, who is where, missing players, not soaked lanes and so forth. reducing my own rage/flaming, i have learned that sometimes when i just wanna say something snarky, if i stay silent and just keep playing, the game turns out better 90% of the times, while at the same time avoiding hurting players that just go emo and refuse to join team, finally don't abuse on pings either, 1 ping as objective is spawning, or signaling i am going to a camp is enough.

Very powerfull against heroes without escape ability. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxc38jYYy5M skillshot hit, because amount of times i used to fail shots as nova, thrall, valla, etc was horrible. skillshot reposition practice, as in Anub'arak position yourself to maximize impale targets hit in the middle of the fight, or valla getting 1 extra person hit by multishot. enemy movement prediction, although still allot of improvement to be done in this part, i already make some good blizzard double hits by getting both the initial hit + the probable escape route covered. Also works good with non aoe spells http://i.imgur.com/F4jPylR.gifv (not me!)   And keep going back to them even after you have mastered, practice makes perfect!

NexusNewbies,3bzump,EZZE__________,2,Sat Jul 4 10:37:51 2015 UTC,"I think the best use of your time would be to level all free heroes to 5 each week in whatever mode you like. This helps you understand their mechanics better so you're not struggling against a good counter. For example, if you play a specialist, know what assassins can gank and kill you when you're laning.  If you have a style preference (support, etc) choose a hero out of that group to focus on. If you divide time between several you won't get familiar with their mechanics on all maps. For example, a specialist has totally different mechanics on Cursed Hollow vs Haunted Mines. You can't focus on laning CH because you need to be available to rush tribute. On HM you're almost exclusively laning since it's only two lanes and you want to push far enough that the enemy team can't easily get into the mines.  And remember that regardless of MMR, sometimes you just get a bad comp. In QM matchmaking (not with friends/family) you're not going to know who will be on your team and sometimes you get stuck with a non-healer support vs a healer with survivability which makes it pretty difficult since you can't just focus them to knock them out of the way.  I agree with u/CunningCartographer though. Just have fun, enjoy the game, and if you play the way you want to play, you should get better and win more often."

I realized that I've been playing long enough that most of my heroes are level 5. One of my level 1's is Abathur and I don't see him being free to play anytime soon.  I'm trying to pay attention to why team wins or loses and what I could have done differently. For example, last game was on the new map (my 4th time ... I keep dodging it) and the other team grouped the whole game and had over 50 kills. My team had 17 kills and I was in on 10 of them as Tyrael. I could have encouraged us to stay together and either defend our immortal or attack the enemy immortal. Effectively we fed the other ""ball of death"" team kills by not coordinating.

NexusNewbies,3bzump,henrax,2,Tue Jul 7 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"Here's what I learned from playing bots and jumping into quick match.  I was like you and played a lot of bots to get heroes up to level 5. When you play bots you win like 95% of the time. I think a lot of people that play bots are trying to improve without ruining other people's play time. At least for me that was the case. There's a lot of pinging and people mostly play the objectives. When you hop into quick match you start out with a low MMR and there are a lot of people that jumped right into QM and didn't play bots at all at that MMR. They don't know how to ping or even know what the pings mean. A lot also play like dota or lol and lane the whole time. They don't even know the map objectives. It's REALLY FRUSTRATING! I started at 1500 MMR so it's bad for a while.  You also learn some bad habits playing bots, like rotating deep in enemy territory and over extending without getting punished. I think a good way to practice getting better in QM is try to go a whole game without dying. This means playing ultra passive. Do this as much as possible and you'll eventually learn when you can be aggressive. You're gunna have to tell people in chat what pings are and that map objectives are important. They will flame you, but it's better than not telling them.  I would spam a lot of QM games with top tier carries or tanks to climb the MMR ranks to get to people that at least know map objectives and can ping. I think people start to get it around 2000ish MMR. I made it up to 2700 doing this, I'm back around 2500 now though.  Good luck bud! Hope to see ya up in the QM ranks!"
NexusNewbies,3bzump,insanemetal187,2,Fri Jul 3 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just your group of friends? Not saying they're bad players, but if they played primarily League and play HotS as if they were playing League i.e. laning longer than needed, missing key map objectives, trying to snowball, etc. then you may lose more of your matches.  I played tons of League before and it took a few games to figure out HoTS mechanics/meta. You can be super good at League and still get stomped in HoTS if you don't understand what's going on with the map you're playing.  To improve your own game play I would suggest:   Play Heroes you've never played with in an AI game to get a feel for their kit. Some would say get them to LVL 5, but that's up to you. Getting a good feel for a Hero isn't always about collecting that 500 Gold, since you may hate the Hero right off the bat. Find a Hero you enjoy playing. If you enjoy a Hero you will do better with them. Win or Lose, understand why the game swung that way e.g. Did you win a critical team fight? Did your team ignore objectives? Watch your Replays. If no one else is Pinging Objectives, then you should. Try to get your team to work as a team. Sometimes doing something stupid together as a team is better than everyone running around loose and alone. Learn the Maps. Understand what objectives need to be captured and when. Never give up, fight till the end."
NexusNewbies,3bzump,henrax,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"Quick reply on the never give up ... I don't. If nothing else sitting waiting for my death timer to tick away gives me a chance to look at the map, reflect and see if there is something can do now. If not ... Is there at least something I can do better next time? Can I do something productive preferably with others and not die.  My team recently got 4 of the enemy team and only lost 2 of ours late in a game we were clearly losing. I'm really glad I was with people who will try till the bitter end. The other team was likely over confident and getting sloppy ... We took advantage of that. We still lost soundly but those small in game victories give me hope."

Also watch some good streamers (chu8 or Grubby on Twitch are very good and explain well).  It's normal to lose at the beginning, just focus on having fun and improving. Try to understand what you did bad and where you could have played better.  Also, what server are you on ? I'm on Eu and would be happy to play a few QMs with you if you're interested."
NexusNewbies,3bzump,henrax,4,Fri Jul 3 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"There's a middle ground and you won't pick up many bad habits if it's only a couple games.  There's nothing more enraging than a newer player playing a hero for the first time on your team.  Last week with Illidian this was happening constantly, guys who have never played him just diving blindly into awful spots.    Personally I play any new hero to lvl 3-5 vs AI to get a feel for them, figure out how each skill works and play with different talents, then do some research then go off to QM.    My team shouldn't suffer because of my complete lack of knowledge."
NexusNewbies,3bzump,SmokeSerpent,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"I always play my first game with a new hero against coop, so you have time to check the talents and do random stuff. And I agree that there are some exceptions like Illidan, Abathur, Murky or the Lost Vikings which are really hard to play at the beginning and should be played against bots for a little while.  I was more talking about playing regularly against IA, and getting used to that gameplay. Of course a couple games here and there after a bad losing streak for example won't do any harm ;)"
NexusNewbies,3bzump,N8CCRG,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"The only issue is that some heroes have their best talents locked until Lv3 so you're really screwing the team in QM by playing a new hero and hamstringing yourself with beginner talents. For example, laning Sylvanas with her basic Lv1 talent isn't as easy since that's geared more towards chase than waveclear.  I realize this doesn't apply after Lv25 but since this subreddit is for newbies, they'll need to know it's probably not advisable to do QM without all the talents available. For OP though, by all means bring a new hero to QM. Just be considerate and let the team know ""hey, I've never played this hero, don't hate me if I make mistakes with abilities"" or at least ask for help on picking abilities (or load a build on IcyVeins before queueing)."
NexusNewbies,3bzump,iwearatophat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"That's true, talent-gating can be an issue. Getting to lvl 3 with the lvl 10 stimpack is really fast tho, maybe two games ? So you can practice two games in coop before playing in HL.  Once again, learning to play the horoes in coop is a good idea. I was just saying that playing against bots almost all your games doesn't help you to improve your strategy and your overall skills.  It's okay to play coop if you think you need it, but most of your games should be played against real people if you want to improve."
NexusNewbies,3bzump,iwearatophat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"Make sure you understand the role your hero is playing in the team and choose your talents and actions to meet that role.  Understand the map dynamics and try to learn some of the meta like how the team should split a map at the beginning or at what level do you go for or defend which camps. Keep in mind that there are competing ideas about this and try to learn to recognize them if the team isn't communicating clearly but is trying to follow them.  All of that aside, the oft-repeated stanza that following stupid will make things more fun and possibly work better than trying to drag stupid along is true. If you're Li Li with no other healer and it's clear no one is letting you play your support role at the beginning, switch gears and build her to survive on her own a little more until the big end-game battles. If no one is going in the mines from your team, don't keep jumping in there to get killed, help do whatever other fool's errand they are on, it can and has led to a close game or a win for me.  Communicate clearly at the beginning of the game so that people understand that you are there with some knowledge and want to communicate. Take the starting warm-up to Say or ask what the initial strategy is going to be, ping your first destination with the boot, etc. Maybe the rest of the team will follow suit. If someone starts doing nonsense like pinging all the camps to mean ""let's get some camps"", follow up after the ping fades with a clear marker (defend/coming) on ONE camp that makes the most sense to you. If someone starts pinging or saying to take the Boss at level 3, ping it with Danger. But again, always be ready to go with the flow and try to shift the flow in a better direction when possible."

The very best players are around 4k. 3k+ is considered as good and generally corresponds to rank 1. Between 2k and 3k are the average players and less than that means that you have still room for improvement. You start with 1700.  This is however very approximative, since the mmr obviously doesn't determine your level with a great accuracy. I've seen mediocre 3500 mmr players and good 2000 mmr players. Your first 100 games and if you play solo or grouped have a great impact on your mmr."

Are you just above Bronze's top player? That means you're better than 20% of the players. Each league corresponds to 20%, aside from Diamond which is 18% and Master being the top 2%, IIRC.  The question is what's ""good"" for you. Are you just above the highest gold, at about 2200 MMR in QM in Europe? That means you're better than 60% of the players. Is that ""good""? Depends on who you ask, it's better than most people. But people in online fora like treating everyone not in the top 5-10% as terrible.

Storm Bolt and Dwarf toss both have a bit of a delay and go where you send them, not to whom you send them.

With heroes like Kerrigan and Muradin be patient with throwing that skillshot unless you are trying to do a leap and bolt type of play.  It's better to land it then miss, and frankly if they are juking around and you aren't biting you are winning."

That being said, it's not your only option. The easiest ""no run"" option is to cc him after he drops the brand. Stuns, silences, anything to make the brand be wasted. If you don't have cc, you probably should run but another option is if you know your stuff, kite him. Bait the Butcher with brandshots and damage him while running. Similar to the last one, if you're melee, bait him into overextending to get to you. Have other teammates wait in fog of war or bushes/vents while you ""run"" only to have him in a 2v1 or 3v1 as he chases you while you're branded."

NexusNewbies,3bylhs,ziggmiceter,8,Fri Jul 3 05:36:48 2015 UTC,"Do you play with friends? If you play with friends -- patient friends! -- Abathur is not that hard to get into. After 1,500-ish games played, mostly as Support, I bought him and paid some attention to him over the last week or so. I learned so much about the game that I was not cognizant of before.   If you don't have friends to play with, don't be too afraid of learning him in Quick Match alone. You might run into some unpleasant people, but I find most people don't really know how he works so the worst that will happen (probably) is that you'll be whined at for not hatting someone. They won't complain that you aren't soaking right, aren't in the right lane, aren't leaving the base when it's safe, etc. Most of 'em just don't know. What this also means: even a totally average Abathur will get compliments by people who don't realize that you're just doing your job! It feels nice.  As far as playstyle, man, I am no expert here. I can tell you what I'm doing and it might give you some ideas to play with. First, you can go to HotsLogs and see how people are building him. Sort it by Diamond league so that you get some reasonably informed results.  Basically, from what I can tell, people seem to prefer building around the hat. The other option prefers locust talents. Depending on your team, one might work better than another. Abathur feels very flexible in this regard.   Generally, I take Pressurized Glands, Adrenal Overload, Needlespine (or MULE in appropriate situations), Monstrosity, Spacial Efficiency, Envenomed Spikes or Locust Brood, then Hivemind or Locust Nest.   I find as Abathur that the minimap is key. I look at it way more than on any other Hero. You have to be watching for potential teamfights so that you can hat someone, pick places to put mines if you need vision (boss, bushes, obj, lanes), etc. This is not difficult to do and will feel natural because you'll be looking for something to do on the Hero. With more experience, you'll be able to put together the pieces of the map faster. At first it'll feel overwhelming (if you're as dumb as me) and your decision-making will feel slower, but then it'll be like, ""Okay, this is where it's safe to be,"" ""I need to remember to move when burrow is off CD so Zera can't get to me,"" ""Teamfight looks likely, gotta get on Illidan.""  Any time I can get out into the middle of a lane, I do it. Aggressive play with Abathur is really fun. Mines starting? Sit in a lane! Boss fight? Sit in a lane! Their team is dead? Sit in a lane! You can actually push pretty well doing this and it adds another element to the character. You need to figure out what lane is safest/most useful to be in while other stuff is going on, but this is not difficult with a little attention to the minimap.   I find the character really intuitive. I would recommend getting him! I was feeling burned out on the game with so many played and no new Support (Monk hype!!), but then I played Abathur and I've fallen in love with the game again. Don't be afraid to be ""bad,"" because you will get better. It will make you better at every other Hero, too. You will see people do INSANE things while you hat them or scan around the map. (This might be an argument for not playing with friends when you're learning Aba, because you will see their shameful secrets as I have with mine...) I'm not always great at following other people's instructions, more of a hands-on guy and a dude who needs to see mistakes happen before I figure something out. That's how Aba teaches you the game mechanics. A masterclass in What Not to Do. Abathur will teach you how to position yourself, soak, and analyze the minimap better as every other Hero.  There's some additional info here (ignore OP, dunno what his deal is, but the replies are good): https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/2ztd43/abathur_players_is_experience_soaking_in_lane/  Also, Trikslyr, a Heroes' CM, does a fun stream and his Aba play is great to watch, if you can catch him on a night he's playing Abathur. http://www.twitch.tv/trikslyr"

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Boobtape,5,Thu Jul 2 20:12:00 2015 UTC,What are the basic strategies for each map? EG when to take the merc camps and when to fight for objectives. I got scolded once for taking a merc camp on haunted mines too early when I thought we had no chance in the mines already.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,porh,16,Fri Jul 3 02:08:43 2015 UTC,"Whew, that's a big question.  Let me see if I can shape it down without losing too much info.  General map strategy:  Soak exp in lanes until level 10.  After level 10, run around the map with your team.  By level 17 you should be working with your team at every moment unless you have an explicit reason/communication to do otherwise.  At most times throughout the game, the objectives take priority when they spawn.  Objective priority has a few specific caveats.  First, if the opponent team is 10+ and your team is 9-, then you aren't likely to win a fight and should avoid skirmishes in all contexts.  Second, if your team is already likely to lose the objective and throwing another player or two towards the fight is unlikely to swing the situation, it's best to let the other team have control.  Third, certain maps (currently Blackheart's Bay) can have their objective use postponed until later (at risk of losing currency) for more efficient results.  This last option is normally reserved for higher tier play where teams can fully communicate.  Mercenaries in general don't do a whole lot for your team if you simply pick up one camp and then abandon it to the lane.  That is absolutely the worst way to use mercs.  The best ways include three major strategies.  First, when you can push with them for extended periods of time for large results.  Second, when you can stack merc camps together.  A single bruiser or siege camp isn't deadly.  A bruiser camp plus 2-3 siege camps can clean out a whole lot of buildings.  Combine with players for extra power.  Third, when the objective is about to spawn on another part of the map.  In this situation it's acceptable to abandon the mercs in lane, because it allows your team to focus on the objective whereas the opponent team needs to decide if they want to weaken their force at the objective in order to defend against mercs, or potentially lose buildings.  Again, some caveats exist.  On the Cursed Hollows, it is a poor use of your time to claim merc camps during the curse.  Either claim the merc camps immediately before or immediately after the objective, but not during.  On the haunted mines you can use your team's siege giants to attack the golem, given appropriate timing.  On the first golem, claim the camp just after the golem passes through the enemy gate.  On subsequent golems, if the golem still needs to destroy your fort, claim the camp just as the golem crawls out of the ground.  General merc tips: Certain maps (dragon, garden, spider) the merc camps disappear (their icons will also be removed from the minimap) when the objective is in full effect.  If you still see a single merc icon on the minimap it means that camp is contested by the opponent players.  Sneaking out to the opponent's side of the map to steal their mercs is a highly dangerous idea unless you're absolutely certain that you'll be safe (you need to know where all the opponent players are located).  Mercing should only be done by characters who are exceptionally good at the job (Gazlowe, Zagara, Sonya, Illidan, and so on), or by groups of players.  Preferably both, since the combination of merc-capable heroes and a few friends is significantly more efficient than soloing.  If your character is not adept at merc camps do not, under any circumstance, attempt to solo a camp.  You have better things to do.  Boss tips:  The boss is frequently called ""the throw pit"", and for good reason.  Grouping your team up to fight the boss is a great way to get all of you killed.  It is best to save the boss for moments when you know the opponent team has absolutely no chance of punishing you for the choice.  The boss scales dramatically with game time.  Early in the game (<11) the boss is only slightly more useful than a bruiser camp.  Mid game (14-19) the boss is formidable as a distraction during objectives or as a point for the team to group around and push.  Late game (>22) the boss is incredibly powerful and, if not properly defended can wreck and entire base or even solo an opponent's core via an exposed lane.    Hope that helps.  Let me know if you have other questions."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,porh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:16:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's totally cool.  Take your time.  At this point in your learning the best way to go about mercs is to let teammates choose when to take them.  If you see someone ping, or if they're already fighting a merc camp nearby, go over and help them clear it up.  But don't fret too much about believing you need to take them yourself at a certain time or that you need to do a specific thing to make use of them.  As you continue to play you'll develop a better sense of when your team likes to take mercs, when the enemy team likes to take mercs, when they work best for your team, when they're most frustrating used against you, and so forth and so on.  When you begin to feel a good sense of that timing it becomes much easier to see how and when is best to take the mercs on your own terms."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,kurros,6,Fri Jul 3 09:13:57 2015 UTC,"I keep dying, and frequently have 12+ deaths in a game. Play mostly Warrior Heroes (been using Sonya lately). What should I be doing through the game? Do I run in to melee too much and without support?"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,burning-ape,22,Thu Jul 2 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"What should I be doing through the game?   Jobs of a warrior.  1: Disruption and crowd control.  2: Peeling for teammates.  3: Spatial control.  4: Initiation.  5: Dealing damage.  6: Taking damage.  Disruption and peeling are pretty obvious.  Most warriors have control skills.  Use them to disrupt fights and protect your teammates.    Space control is an extension of the first two.  Opponents should be afraid to just walk past a warrior.  Not because a warrior can win a 1v1 duel, but because warriors use disruption to enable their team to destroy opponents.  So owning the space around you, even if there isn't anything going on at the moment, is a big part of your job.  Most simply this means you should stand between your squishies and the opponents.  But it also means if the team needs someone to scout around a corner, watch a corridor against incoming opponents, or soak up pot-shots while someone else grabs a macguffin, that's your job.  Because when a baddie comes into view you're the one who can land a stun to give your allies time to reposition and still survive taking a few hits long enough to join them a moment later.  Initiation is a subset of spatial control.  People confuse it for the broader definition of initiation, which is ""starting a fight.""  Starting a fight is insufficient purpose.  Anyone can start a fight.  A fight will start whether or not a warrior is present.  Your job is to start a fight in a way that gives your team the best control of space, and allows the most disruption.  This also does not necessarily mean to start a fight by using disruption.  Sometimes it's best to save that for later.  In a similar vein, this means that if the opposing team has your teammates on the run, you won't win back the space by simply being there.  Part of your capacity to control space relies on having your teammates at your back.  No help from teammates means no spatial control, and therefore no point in initiating.  If all of the above needs are met, make sure you get in a bit of damage now and then as well.  Now, Taking damage, which is where this whole long post gets back to your original question.  Taking damage is your last priority.  None of the above 5 jobs require you to take damage.  You probably will, because the world is dangerous, but that wasn't the point.  If anything, the point is that you should not take damage.  Don't do it.  It isn't your job.  Everything that you need to do can be done without taking damage as a requirement.  This diverges from what most people understand about warrior archetype characters.  The general belief is that Warriors are tanks, and tanks are supposed to take damage so that other players don't need to.  But this logic creates two fallacies.  First, Sonya, Anub'Arak, and Tyrael are not tanks, and it is not their job to tank.  Second, damage can be avoided.  It doesn't need to go to someone.  You can all simply stay out of its way.  And as a warrior, there's no more reason for you to eat extra damage than any other class type.    Pithy tips tl;dr: Warriors are not the team's battering ram.  Don't smash your face into the opponent team and hope that they, like a wooden door, break open and let your team in.  You aren't tough enough for that.  You will lose.  Instead, warrior's are the team's riot police.  Wait for someone to come to you, then beat them on the head with a billy club.  Or beat them with the club if they attacked one of your friends.  But otherwise, don't provoke an attack against yourself for no good reason."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,2,Fri Jul 3 01:17:02 2015 UTC,This is the best post on warriors I have ever read.  Going to completely change how I play them.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,WhiteStripesWS6,2,Fri Jul 3 07:40:19 2015 UTC,Glad to hear.  I hope the advice works well for you.   Best of luck with your warrioring!
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,2,Fri Jul 3 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"Fantastic, this is exactly what I was looking for. So as a Warrior, I should basically be protecting my team and making sure any fights we get in to can be won by using disruption?"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,burning-ape,4,Fri Jul 3 13:37:02 2015 UTC,"For the most part, yes.  You have to adapt the strategy for certain warriors.  As example: Sonya and Tyrael and Chen have low CC output for their archetype.  Unlike Diablo, Anub'Arak, or ETC, players can walk past them without the expectation of getting locked down for an extended amount of time.  Not only will you need to use what little CC they have with smarter timing, you'll also need to rely on their damage output to bully opponent players out or away from the space.  This is why these warriors are often considered ""secondary tanks"", and picked to fill the role of a survivable melee dps in conjunction with a more standard tank.    Lets take Sonya as a quick example.  Your crowd control consists of the chain, and maybe the leap.  What a lot of inexperienced players tend to do is use the chain as soon as they're in range of opponents as a way to get into battle.  Sure you enter the fight quickly and gain a little bit of rage, but you've also blown your only CC for the next 9-13 seconds.  So if a teammate needs a peel or a low health opponent is about to escape, you're high and dry.  Likewise, I'll see Sonya leap into a group of 4 players well ahead of her team.  It seems like a good idea on the surface: you're initiating with a stun that hits 4 people.  But you're also burning the best mobility tool and CC to get into a 1v4 without their team there ready to help.    Now, these are not issues particular to Sonya.  I see people do this all the time with all sorts of Warriors.  Diving in far ahead of their team (this kills the warrior) or burning their CC at the very first sight of an opponent.  Those actions don't fulfill any of the good reasons to bring a warrior.  Instead, save CC for a peel to save a teammate, or for lockdown when you see a dps focus on a target.  Don't use mobility spells to enter the fight, save them for pinching a fleeing opponent or escaping damage or pressuring opponents from a new angle.    Back to Sonya: your Seismic Slam can get pretty bursty in the mid-late game.  It may not be CC, but you can punish melee divers (Illidan, Thrall, Butcher) for getting close to your team with Slam>Chain>Slam, or you can pressure opponent ranged dps with Leap>Slam (remember not to jump to your death) to a very similar end result as a standard tank would achieve with CC.  Either the opponents get wrecked for going ham, or they scatter out of position, and your team benefits either way."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Captaincastle,3,Mon Jul 13 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Sonya is more of an assassin to be honest, she is very paper tanky if you try and do that. She is a good initiator but you never want to try and take them all on. AnubArak is also a good initiator and can escape in a bind.  You'll die more than the rest as a warrior but it's important to know when to run off. Don't overestimate how tough you are Captaincastle said. Play more cautiously till you are able to peel for your team and get away in the process."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,m_takeshi,2,Thu Jul 2 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"The problem I had in playing a warrior was over estimating my toughness.  Coming from wow, I'm used to diving in and pulling aggro. That only works with dps shooting your enemies and healers keeping you up.  Basically, just play cautiously. Punish their mistakes, don't try to brute force it.  At least until you get more experience and get a better sense of when to push and when to bait."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,PopEffingTart,2,Thu Jul 2 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"just a small note: sonya is not too tanky compared to, say, Muradin, ETC or Johana so it might be that you're overextending with her a bit.  Also, tanks usually need a good healer to support them or you have to play carefully as well"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,m_takeshi,5,Thu Jul 2 21:07:30 2015 UTC,How do you play the lost Vikings and should I even try?
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,mertcan1k2,4,Thu Jul 2 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"while I'm still not very good with them (specially after the patch), the way I usually do it is:  -split into 2 lanes (Olaf in one, Erik and Baelog in the other)  -have your team push the third lane heavily and pressure for kills or rotate aggressively for objectives  -if an enemy leaves a lane, sit one of the vikings in the bush while pushing the other lane (forcing the enemy team to do something), otherwise just try to not push any of the lanes while soaking xp in both (being very carefull)  -whenever an objective spawns, you have to make a choice to either split into lanes or go for the objective  I usually have 2x the amont of XP of any other team player. Before the last patch, I would have a good hero damage as well, but now I have just a decent siege damage...  Overall I recommend getting them because its really fun but they are a bit of a stress to manage (and pricey at 10k...)"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Bflakes1486,6,Thu Jul 2 21:05:41 2015 UTC,What is MMR?
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,3,Thu Jul 2 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"MMR = Matchmaking rating I believe, coming from league it is essentially an invisible ""ranking"" that matches you with players of the same ""rank."" Someone please correct me if I'm wrong."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Bflakes1486,3,Thu Jul 2 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"You are correct in concept.  In detail, a little off.  In Hots, not all players in a game are expected to have the same mmr.  In fact it's very rare that you see all 10 players as close together as +- 50 mmr.  Rare on the order of less than 1% of all games.  More commonly you'll see a spread of +- 500 mmr per team.  It's necessary for the algorithm to accommodate these swings since the matchmaker cannot prevent multiple players from grouping up prior to entering the queue, which means it cannot prevent a 2500 mmr player from grouping with a 1500 mmr player.    Rather than matching each player on the team, the algorithm attempts to match the average rating of teams against each other.  Eg, a team of players ranging 1500-2200 with an average mmr of 1800 would get matched against a team of players ranging 1700-2500 with an average mmr of 1850.  You're still looking at a large mmr spread among players (1500 to 2500) but a much smaller spread between teams (1800 to 1850)."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,2,Fri Jul 3 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"Oh ok thanks for clarifying! I have a question though, according to Hotslogs my QM MMR is 2355 (I know this isn't 100% accurate). Do you know what rank that is around? I came from league and I wasn't really motivated to get a high rank (Gold 3 was my highest I believe), but with HotS I really want rank 1 :D"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Anglefyre,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"According to hotslog's version of the ranking that puts you on the low end of Plat.    Keep in mind, however, that MMR and Rank are separate entities.  It is technically possible to be Rank 1 with 1500 mmr, or rank 40 with 3000 mmr.  The current behavior of Rank follows the structure that you see in Hearthstone.  Feel free to look that up if you'd like more info there, I personally don't know much about Hearthstone."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Anglefyre,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:29:44 2015 UTC,It stands for matchmaking rating. It's how Blizzard matches you up with players.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,WhiteStripesWS6,5,Thu Jul 2 22:15:29 2015 UTC,What is Murky?
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,WhiteStripesWS6,4,Thu Jul 2 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"Guess i'll just answer myself...  Murky is a Specialist hero in the game called Heroes of the Storm, he has very unique and a fun and interesting game style! Currently murky is 7,000 gold or $8.49 USD.  You can find more Murky related information here"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,ghost03080,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:42:40 2015 UTC,Haha I was going to say Murky is a troll :P
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,elpy2000,2,Fri Jul 3 00:16:33 2015 UTC,Is the idea behind Murky to just be a pest and get people to focus on him while your team blasts away at the enemy heroes?  What penalties do his deaths come with when he's got the assault egg out? Does his respawn time stay short or does it get longer as the game goes on?
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Bflakes1486,4,Fri Jul 3 07:28:24 2015 UTC,"Murky can do pretty good damage to heroes if you let him. He used to be amazing at pushing towers + forts but not so much now. BUT if he is left unchecked he can do some good damage.   He gets underestimated a bit imo, he is capable of pretty good damage in a 1v1 from what I have seen.   As for his respawn timer, it will always be 5 seconds as long as his egg is up. If you kill the egg and then him straight after, he has a normal respawn timer like everyone else. If you kill his egg he is revealed globally on the map until he plants a new egg. I believe every time you kill him it is 0.25 or 0.5 of a kill (I forget which).  I will say if the team is focusing murky all the time they need to change their priorities since a good murky will constantly move the egg to be nearer to an objective."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,3,Fri Jul 3 17:25:06 2015 UTC,what does the easy medium and hard mean when choosing a character I'm assuming it's the difficulty of learning the character?
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Dunked_Biscuit,3,Thu Jul 2 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"I see it more like a way to indicate the difficulty to use it efficiently. It can be because of its inner mechanics (for example Abathur) or because it is less mistake forgiving; Illidan is hard, not because he's complex, but because a mistake will result in a certain death; Raynor or Valla can make mistakes and survive."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:03:16 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it, could mean they have built in spell rotations or mechanics that take a while to master. Don't let it deter you though if it's a free hero take it into an AI game and atleast try them you never know"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,EonShiKeno,3,Fri Jul 3 00:05:30 2015 UTC,How good do I have to be with a hero before I play pvp matches? I don't want to be raged at.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Ceadol,3,Fri Jul 3 02:02:53 2015 UTC,"As soon as the AI begins to feel easy, you're ready for PvP.    Keep in mind that vsAI games can teach you a lot of bad habits which will make your transition to PvP more difficult.  The longer you continue to play vs AI, the less easily you'll get over those bad habits.  It's better to switch as soon as you're ready.  You'll still have a lot to learn, and the transition is rocky no matter when you decide to do it, but keep a positive attitude and you'll certainly grow to match the difficulties.  You will inevitably run in to a rager.  If not raging at you, then raging at someone else.  It is a sad but honest truth of the environment.  What is more important than avoiding these people is learning to not let them ruin your day.  They're getting upset over a fun game.  And that's silly.  There's no reason why you'd have to share in their tantrum.  It's highly unlikely that you'll see them again.  And if all else fails, it's probably a good time to take a five minute break away from the game anyway."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Ceadol,2,Fri Jul 3 02:34:57 2015 UTC,There are always ragers in QM. Don't let it dissuade you from playing!
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,elpy2000,2,Fri Jul 3 12:15:54 2015 UTC,How do you solo a boss as Gazlowe? I tried taking the 50% less damage talent along with his Robo Goblin ultimate and still have a hard time surviving the fight.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Bflakes1486,7,Thu Jul 2 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"I think the more important question is why you'd want to solo a boss?    Not to imply that you should never solo a Boss.  But the reality is that soloing a boss takes a great deal of time, resources, opportunity, and safety.  Even in an optimal situation with the correct talents you should expect to lose most of your life and mana and need to return to base soon after.  Chances are, the majority of situations will not be optimal.  Chances of getting ganked rise dramatically, and when you include the time of returning to base to heal, the possibility of missing out on a critical team fight or setting up for an objective will certainly riset.  On the other hand, Gazlowe is already so good at clearing mercs that just one other player, of any type, will drastically improve the situation.  A tank to sponge damage will increase turret uptime and thus damage output, a ranged dps will rapidly decrease the time-to-kill, a healer can provide enough upkeep for you to stay on the map afterwards.  These are all massive efficiency gains.  I know soloing bosses gets touted as one of the few places that Gazlowe shines.  But that doesn't make it a smart decision most of the time.  Some times, very rarely, yes, it is both doable and savvy.  But most of the time it's a way to get killed by savvy players.  In any case, to answer your question directly.  First, set up as many turrets as possible in advance of the fight.  Don't crowd them all at the feet of the boss, or they'll all get erased with one of the aoe stuns.  Instead, put one down near the boss to tank a couple hits, and space the others out so that they won't get hit with aoe.  Let the turrets round-robin the boss attacks, and keep replacing them in their original location each time the boss kills one.  This should mitigate most of the damage for you.  After that, it's all about speccing for damage output."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,TrueGrey,2,Fri Jul 3 00:32:37 2015 UTC,Make sure you set up your turrets before you start fighting.  Don't let the boss kill your turrets.

Not that it matters, I didn't buy it for the Stimpack, I got it for the characters. But still, I was curious."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,NFLfan2539,2,Thu Jul 2 22:37:10 2015 UTC,they do stack
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,jmcq,2,Thu Jul 2 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"This is my current hero roster  Warrior: Arthas, Tyrael, ETC  Assassin: Zeratul, Valla  Support: Lili, Tyrande  Specialist: Sylvanas  I plan on going into hero league fairly soon after I hit 30, and i'm looking to pick up Jaina or Kael'thas and another support (leaning towards Rehgar / Uther) with my next hero pickups, does anyone recommend something else?"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,elpy2000,3,Thu Jul 2 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"I recommend EXACTLY that.  After jaina/kael and rehgar/uther, your 3rd priority might want to be a true specialist or something weird & fun: zagara, azmodan, murky, hammer etc - they're so much fun to play and very different"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,jmcq,2,Thu Jul 2 22:21:34 2015 UTC,"Just a fair warning when you get into Hero League:  If you're the final pick and your team needs a support, do not pick Tyrande.  She is not a true support since she heals for very little compared to LiLi for example.    It probably doesn't matter when you first start out, but as you climb higher in ranks, you will get flamed if you do what I mentioned above."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Helix1322,2,Fri Jul 3 02:40:26 2015 UTC,If at the beginning of the game the enemy team all stack in 1 lane and push what's the correct reaction? Join together and try to push back enemy (seems right?) or should we still be soaking in lane? This has happened to me at least a handful of times and always on Spider Queen...
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Sq33KER,6,Thu Jul 2 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"Before level 10, a minion wave will give more experience than a kill. The correct reaction is to soak xp on lanes"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,nightshiftb,5,Thu Jul 2 23:47:24 2015 UTC,Just spread out and soak. They will look for kills but if you stay semi passive and near  your towers they will fall behind in exp while your team is in all 3 lanes.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,dtyanes,2,Fri Jul 3 00:18:44 2015 UTC,When I tried to stay in my (empty) lane and soak 3 members of my team kept suiciding into the enemy 5 and we ended up losing the fort. The E.T.C blamed me for staying in my lane and being afraid to die (lol) and then AFKd for half the game.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,SerenaRosaire,2,Fri Jul 3 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"Ignore them if they say that. Getting the exp lead > kills. If you can team fight while you are on a new talent tier and they aren't, they are going to get rekt.   After about level 15-17 you want to stay with your team as much as possible though."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:10:13 2015 UTC,To add to the people above don't feel forced to play standard lanes. Definitely have 3 people stay in the lane they are rushing even if you wouldn't in normal situations. If you can have a tank and healer in that lane and just try to not die and let your two solo laners push as hard as they can
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,dtyanes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"Either stack 3-2 in the other two lanes for the push and exp, or stack 2-1-2 where the 1 stays in the lane with the 5 opponents, but just in range of exp for the minion soak.  Your team will then gain substantially more experience from minion waves than the other team, and hopefully you can turn that into a lead as the game reaches the mid-late stages.    If you are playing in QM or HL do not, under any circumstance, attempt to push them back.  It's very easy to feed their team one player at a time when you don't have the appropriate communication to decide how or when you'll all enter the fight.  If you're in Team League, your best opportunity is to wait for their team to wash against your gates, and then pincer them by running in the middle of the lane towards your base.  They'll be trapped by your walls and take extra damage from your towers.  By focusing on the correct heroes you can use this advantage to secure 2-3 kills fairly quick."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"The ideal strategy would be to lane as a 3-1-1 setup. 3 people plus your towers should be able to easily hold off 5, and your team will get a massive exp lead. Another option would be to go 4-1 if your team doesn't feel confident defending against 5 with 3. I would suggest putting ranged characters and healers on defense, while the melee go soak. The reason for this is that your tank is not going to be useful in a 3v5. He can't go out and engage and really you want the 3 to be behind the towers where they are safe."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,dtyanes,2,Fri Jul 3 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"As a new player, I have had a lot of trouble playing melee character both Assassin, and Tank.  How do Melee fight in a group battle with no healer?"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,PyroKirby0,2,Fri Jul 3 00:10:21 2015 UTC,"Without a healer it is very difficult and it varies from hero to hero but put simply:  -If you have single target cc (Thrall's W), wait for an enemy to stand far away from their team the cc them and get your team to burst them.  -If you have aoe cc (ETC's Mosh pit), wait for the enemy to be in as big a group as possible then engage and use the aoe cc and focus their supports if they have any (especially if you dont)  -Squishy no cc DPS (Illidan) DONT ENGAGE. Your job on these heroes is to kill people escaping. do not run into the fight unless one of the two catagories above have already done their job.  (these will all work well with a healer on your team, especially ones with cc)   -Tanky but little hard cc (Chen) just sit near your team and stop the enemies from doing ^ to your team by taking any damage necessary. For talents, if you do not have a healer or only have Tyrande/Tassadar, make sure to take the more defensive talents where possible. Also consider abilities that will heal allies like chen's enough to share or etc's groupies (which are not bad anyway) to become a substitute healer."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:20:16 2015 UTC,"Melee can definitely be challenging. I've found it requires a new mentality as opposed to a ranged hero. As a ranged player, you can harass your enemy and start to bring down their hp from a distance. This means you don't have to commit to an engagement until you are ready. Melee heroes, on the other hand, have to commit to the fight from the start, and it highly depends on the target to determine if jumping in is smart/safe. Therefore, in the early and mid game non-tank melee should be paired up with either a tank or a ranged dps. Consider this if your team already has a Johanna and a Kerrigan for example, and help your team stay balanced by picking a ranged hero instead of Illidan or the butcher."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,3,Fri Jul 3 00:17:30 2015 UTC,It is free. You should be able to master it with enough practice. Just start with the AI and work yourself up. You are going to lose and be okay with that.

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Eriennyl,3,Fri Jul 3 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"18-23 minutes is standard for a game.    But that's just the time for the game itself.  It's more realistic to expect a minimum of 30 minutes for a full game ""session"", where the additional time goes towards puttering around the UI, waiting for the queue to pop, reviewing the end-game stats, deciding which hero to play, and other little things like that.

However, don't get that confused with free deaths.  You still want to survive.  It's just much more difficult.  Stitches: Overnerfed in prior patches.  He went from a must-have-pick to one of the least used tanks in the game in short order.  In part because the nerfs did him in.  In part because counters have been discovered/introduced.  In part because meta shifts placed other tanks in higher regard.  Diablo: Debatably underpowered.  Easily the most perpetually bugged character in the game, with the past 4-5 patches involving some kind of severe bug at one point or another.  Great fun when used well.  Recent changes to his talents introduced damage-oriented builds that don't seem to fit him all that well."

He was top tier upon release, got nerfed into oblivion, then nerfed again, then buffed into a reasonable state, then buffed into a good position.  Stitches and Diablo have both gone from top dogs to low interest picks as well, and are likely to rise again at some point.  Patches happen.  Metas change.  Counter-picks are introduced.  All sorts of things can happen that take a strong character out of the loop or vice-versa.  Pick first from who you like, and second from who is good."

Since the last patch he is somewhat squishy until you get a healthy number of souls, but as long as you play somewhat cautiously he is extremely fun to play. Lots of CC and tossing heroes around. Watching the enemy try to scramble back to their gate after you just shoved them into your back line is pleasant. I recommend trying him out!"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,2,Fri Jul 3 12:13:55 2015 UTC,"What's the logic behind the picks in the hero league?  I watched whole tournaments during the past two weeks, trying to ""soak"" as much knowledge from the players and the commentators; unfortunately, I did not learn a whole lot from them.   I knew some of the interactions and considerations before, and now I know more of them, but I still don't grasp the general strategy behind the picks. I would love an explanation on this topic."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,hacdladf1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:05:28 2015 UTC,"Not the best person to explain but u get the rough idea.  Maps most importantly, and counters to opposing team.  On maps like TSQ, Azmodan can get his 500dmg stacks up fast with Johanna doing the setup. Haunted mines will do good with Sylvanas or other lane pushers like Zagaara."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,orangeway69,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:27:11 2015 UTC,"While gathering info on this topic, I keep finding propositions like: - Hero X is particularly good on map Y. - Hero X is particularly good as a counter-pick to hero Y. - Hero X has significant synergies with heri Y. - Hero X is a strong / weak pick in current meta / patch.  This stuff is definitely useful, and I maintain a list of this kind of notions.  What I still struggle with, is understanding the basic / general / macroscopic strategy behind the picking of heroes, and I'm hoping for someone to explain those dynamics to me.  What are the priorities? Aka: should I focus more on filling roles or on map synergies? or hero synergies? or counter-picks? or just picking ""good"" heroes on current meta (because they are just plain better)."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,me__uk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:09:03 2015 UTC,"Priorities go in order from most general to most specific.  In the most general: Am I, personally, good at playing this hero?  After that: is my hero choice sensible given the map we're on, the opponent heroes (do you know who is difficult to play against?) and my teammate heroes (do you know who has good synergy with the character you picked)?  After that, the priority shifts to meta, build ideas, whole-team-composition, and expectation of future hero picks.  This may sound like a lot, but insofar as what you need to know for hero league, it's sufficient to just understand your own character.  You don't need to understand everyone's character or the entire landscape of the game.  You only need to understand enough to make your personal pick effective.  Who are they good against?  Who shuts them down?  Are they better on that particular map than your other pick options.  For example.  If you want to pick Illidan, and you see your team has a Rehgar or an Abathur and no other melee dps, this is a good combination for you.  However if your team has Brightwing, and their team has Uther and Jaina, this is a bad composition for illidan.  And that's it.  That's pretty much the extent of what you need to know.  Furthermore, this is all knowledge that you should have about your best characters given that you play them most and have the largest gamut of experience with them.  The larger-scale understanding of the game will arise as you continue to play.  Paying attention to the tournament scene will provide solid information, but try not to treat it as gospel.  Somethings combinations work in pro-leagues a whole lot better than they work in HL or QM.  In any case, you're trying to learn in the right way.  Continue that and you'll figure it all out eventually."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,2,Fri Jul 3 13:48:42 2015 UTC,"So I started this game this week.  Been a blast so far.  My question is, aside from XP and clearing the path, what does killing Forts/Keeps do for you?  Anything?  Does killing a fort make the minions in that lane get stronger?  Does killing the keep trigger the catapults to spawn in that lane?  Does killing all 6 of them make the core weaker?  The game doesn't really tell you if anything happens.  I just thought I remembered stuff like what I listed happening in DotA/HoN."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,EZZE__________,3,Fri Jul 3 07:25:53 2015 UTC,"Killing the final big Keep/Fort thing in front of the core will spawn catapults in that lane. Minions stay the same strength, I think they scale with level. You can't attack the core until at least one of the final Keep/Forts is destroyed."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,SeriousCaller,4,Fri Jul 3 09:15:07 2015 UTC,"The castle that is closest to the middle of the map is a Fort.  The castle that is closest to your Core is a Keep.  Each is worth the same experience bonus, but a Keep will cause catapults to spawn in that lane as well.  To damage the Core, at least one Keep must have died.  To damage a keep, the preceeding Fort must have died."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Archemyst,2,Fri Jul 3 11:39:58 2015 UTC,"First and foremost: don't gauge your quality of play, or anyone else's for that matter, by the scoreboard numbers.  Not the same thing at all.  Is it normal?  Yes and no.  There are certain builds with Zeratul that allow for more persistent damage output, though they're usually more dangerous as well.  But in all cases you'll necessarily be relegated to bypassing moments for general damage output in favor of landing a kill when its just right to do so.  Other damage oriented characters don't need to be so selective about their timing, and so they can rack up damage on the meter here and there a little at a time.    So, yes, it is somewhat normal that you'll have high kills and low damage."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:30:53 2015 UTC,"As a roamer you're not going to be getting a lot of xp. Also you're mostly a single target hero. Yes you have an aoe ability, but most of the time it's against a single target. The power of zera is burst. This is really nice for zoning people out early game to get the XP lead. Sending the other team back to base is your main goal early game, besides outright killing them when they are out of position."

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,ghost03080,2,Fri Jul 3 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"IMHO, once you begin playing Quick Match, don't return to vsAI.  AI will teach you all sorts of bad habits that are very difficult to break vs players, and will certainly put you at a disadvantage.    There are a select few characters who are just so weird it might be worth playing the first game on them vs AI.  Namely: Abathur, The Lost Vikings, and Murky."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,Eriennyl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:46:26 2015 UTC,"I always just played QM even if it was a new hero.

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,ghost03080,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"I usually run 1 or 2 games vs AI to learn the basic mechanics of a hero. QM after that. The AI are extremely forgiving if you overextend, and you'll find yourself developing bad habits. You won't pay for a mistake, and they'll continue to rush you 1v4 as they respawn. You won't learn when to take camps, how to efficiently approach objectives, etc. Also, you'll tend to avoid defensive talents because you won't need them. Play QM and learn as you go. If people start bitching in QM just say ""new to this hero, sorry"" and I find 99% of the time they cool off immediately. IMO start by playing a char and trying to die less than 2 or 3 times. As you get more comfortable with them start playing more aggressively. GL!"

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,orangeway69,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:39:34 2015 UTC,At the start you can sit at the towers on the outer forts and you should be able to soak just fine. Good Abathurs I have seen will move around the map to empty lanes and soak that while symbioting a different lane minion to get that experience. u/Balancedbreakfast has a video he did on Hero League Abathur Symbiote build play recently that I think might help you to see how he is moving around. I believe he has some more Abathur ranked plays if you want to check them out.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,TheMieberlake,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:21:13 2015 UTC,How does XP work?  Do 5 heroes in the same lane get 1/3 the total XP of 2-1-2 split?  Why does TLV end up so far ahead in XP then if he splits up and is sharing each lane with another hero.
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,envygm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:43:26 2015 UTC,"Theoretically its 1/3 if u stack 5 in a lane instead of 2/1/2(or any).

NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,maldrame,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:09:31 2015 UTC,"Also, when objectives are up, TLV can keep one (or more) Viking(s) soaking XP while the teams are fighting."

This was my theory.  TLV aren't actually ""that good"" then at lane soaking, right? since they just open up the possibility of 2 1/3-1 1/3-1 1/3 which is basically the same.  It just overstates their own impact on the scoreboard.  I guess they really shine when the rest of the team is off doin objectives and they are 1/3-1/3-1/3"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,dtyanes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"so 3-1-1 earns the same xp as 1-1-1 earns more than 5-0-0? (just in terms of lane soaking).    Correct.   TLV aren't actually ""that good"" then at lane soaking, right?   On the contrary, they're debatably the best.  You see, each viking earns a full amount of Exp for a leech, not 1/3.  This effectively means four of your team members can go after an objective (like the curse) and you still get 1-1-1 soak in all the lanes, not 1/3 in each.  A well played Vikings will exploit this benefit to give their team an early game level advantage."
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,dtyanes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if the rest of your own team with TLV is in lanes, he's not actually earning more XP, but his scoreboard will be vastly overstated? (since basically hes taking shares from every other player on his team, rather than printing XP)"
NexusNewbies,3bwsmr,_beloved,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"Supposing you have a 2-2-2 lane setup where TLV has one viking in each lane.  The three individual players would show 0.66 total exp gain, and TLV would show 1.0 exp gain.  So, yes, this would show TLV as earning more.  Which is technically true.  He's running three lanes at once.  In many ways one could argue that it's fair for him to show a higher exp gain on the scoreboard that way.  Though all in all I think this simply teaches us that we shouldn't trust the scoreboard.  For any reason.  The numbers are fun, but they don't equate to the weight of one's contribution."
NexusNewbies,3bzax9,Tiamatt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:46:52 2015 UTC,"My advice is to play more, try another week or 2 of rotation before buying. You listed 3 heroes with different playstyles so its hard to give u an answer but anyway I posted a similar reply on who to buy in another thread. They are not necessarily the meta as that changes with every patch but IMO they are the most value for gold and have proven good so far, or better post-nerf/buff.  My list of decent/good heroes:  2k - Valla, Muradin, Malfurion, E.T.C  4k - Illidan, Anub'arak, Tassadar/Tychus(both are okay but I would hold off buying these 2 IMO)  7k - Rehgar(so good now), Uther, Tyreal, Zagaara  10k - Jaina, Kael'thas, Johanna, Zeratul, Sylvanas  Don't have much experience with the rest"
NexusNewbies,3bzax9,Eriennyl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:54:34 2015 UTC,"You might like Valla. She's very mobile with a ridiculous damage output. She's squishier than the ones you've listed, but has better escape to make up for it. Also, she's only 2k gold, which you can make up over half of back from leveling her.  Past that, I would say just keep trying out the free week stuff because each hero really plays in a unique way that might or might not click with you. I really hate tanks in general, but Johanna's one of my favorite heroes to run."
NexusNewbies,3bzax9,EraserParticles,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"Save your gold. Like others have said, play another few weeks of free rotation. By the time you get to Lecel 40, you'll have ~45k in gold, which will be enough for a team in HL. When you get there, just buy the heroes you enjoy to play, but keep in mind that you need at least 2-3 supports and 2-3 warriors. What I did was make a list that I edited over time of the heroes I enjoyed the most, enjoyed the least, and somewhat enjoyed. That way you can keep track of who you liked to play when they were free so that you can buy them when you reach Level 40.  My first 11 heroes, for reference  Assassins: Falstad Zeratul Jaina Valla  Warriors: Anub'Arak Muradin E.T.C  Supports: Brightwing Rehgar   Specialists: Zagara Sylvanas  This would be over 45k in gold, but I got Zeratul, Jaina, and Zagara from the starter bundle and BW on sale."

I like to take Marked for Death instead of Thirsting Blade for extra damage as the fights you pick tend not to be very long and you want the most damage in the shortest amount of time. I take Blood for Blood instead of Second Sweep because Illidan doesn't need two charges of his W; with it's modest cooldown and his trait it should pretty much always be up. Blood for Blood also gives you some sustain that you're missing out on by picking Marked for Death instead of Thirsting Blade. Plus it adds to your play style of Hunting someone alone and just making their health bar explode. I also take Nexus Blades instead of Nowhere to Hide for that very reason. If I've been unlucky and someone else shows up to help my victim fairly often that game I'll take Bolt of the Storm to stay alive. Plus no map is usually big enough to warrant needing Nowhere to Hide since you can just mount up and ride 5 seconds to be within range."

NexusNewbies,3bwb1q,drunkengeebee,2,Thu Jul 2 18:23:49 2015 UTC,Adding to drunkengeebee's comment  Leaving 1/2 enemies undevoured let's your team kill them. However as you get better you need to learn who to leave out. By leaving a tank like say ETC/Arthas out you are able to kill off their front liner and then position to kill the remaining team. Or you leave out their dps/squishies like Thrall/Valla and limit their ability to do damage to your team. Ultimately your own team composition will affect how and when to use Maw
NexusNewbies,3buv0d,Sreyz,2,Thu Jul 2 09:55:52 2015 UTC,"I think that the top 3 Tanks are currently Anub'arak, Muradin, and Johanna, with Johanna being the best ""true"" Tank and Anub'arak being a good off-Tank (or 2nd Tank). Her waveclear from Knight Takes Pawn is extremely good. She's really solid all around and has no counters. All she lacks is mobility."

NexusNewbies,3bsicy,Bazylik,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"To fully recharge, yes.  But sometimes it's more viable to grab a lil health/mana and get right back into lane.  Or you could grab a healing fountain once you get back into lane."

NexusNewbies,3bsicy,zeohi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"My only issue is that it seems like you can't queue up mounting if it's on cooldown. For example, you can't be mounted up and run up to turn in coins on Blackhearts Bay, then queue mount and queue running away. You have to wait til your mount is off cooldown which often happens near the end of channels like tributes, coins, etc so it's still doable but it's kinda annoying."

NexusNewbies,3bsxb3,Pandemicx,8,Wed Jul 1 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"First of all, a character doesn't have to be top tier to be used or even first picked in Hero League. Second, if a character looks fun, play it. No matter what anyone else says.   It's actually funny you said you played Valla after mentioning top tier as Valla is literally the definition of mid tier. Valla isn't seen in a lot of competitive matches, and there are a lot of choices for ranged damage above her.   Tl;dr, play what you want to play, don't worry too much about tiers ^"
NexusNewbies,3bsxb3,EnvyHotS,2,Thu Jul 2 03:02:14 2015 UTC,Tychus was always a pretty good character at least. He got a huge buff to his aa range and got some nerfs to the typical build that centered around the grenade. My friend who plays him well has been having a great time since the patch dropped playing him.  Also I would say that playing a hero you know well and you feel comfortable with will help you more than a meta pick you don't. I've seen Nazeebo's and other nonmeta picks mop the floor with top tier heroes when played by someone who that hero just fits with.
NexusNewbies,3bsxb3,dreamslave,0,Thu Jul 2 06:36:09 2015 UTC,"I used to hate tychus and put him in the shit tier along with stitches but I guess the changes put him in the Raynor tier at least, maybe not falstad/Valla level and not close to Jaina/kael but we will see."
NexusNewbies,3bst38,asher1611,3,Wed Jul 1 21:24:09 2015 UTC,"At times like these, I like to remember my favorite gaming quote ever by Day9. ""Your rank on ladder is not a measure of skill, it's a measure of progress.""  ""I'm just fearful of being stuck in Rank 30 and being on a kind of semi-competent player treadmill."" - This right here is what will hold you back. The fear of being competent is what makes you competent. Ladder anxiety is a very real thing however, and if you don't wanna queue up, then don't. I've found that duo queueing, maybe a trio queue can help to liven things up a bit, but just remember if you never play the game, you'll never get better at it. If you actually belong in the rank 30 range, playing against significantly higher ranked people will not help you as much as you think it would. It's a process, it's a climb, you don't just strap on a jetpack. Climbing a ladder in any game is about getting better whether it's fast or slow, just try to learn from what you did wrong and move on.   Also, skill bonus can come back. Your first 100 games or so have a drastic effect on your MMR and this can affect skill bonus, etc. Best advice I can give you is to look up ladder anxiety and find what works for you to get past it, and remember that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being a mid tier player. Don't listen to anyone telling you that ""This game's easy"", and ""Rank 1 is free, you just have to play the game"". Just don't give up."
NexusNewbies,3bst38,EnvyHotS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"First, understand how the ranks work. Two numbers are made to determine your level, and are linked to each others : your rank, and your mmr. Your mmr is hidden and works like an elo ranking. When you win a game, you'll win a certain number of mmr points, depending on two things :    The mmr difference between your team and the opponents  Your ""uncertainty level"", aka how much the system believes to know your level. The higher this level, the more points you will win (or lose).   Your uncertainty level is very high at the beginning and will decrease progressively. But you can raise it by ""disappointing the system"" : winning against supposedly better teams or losing against worse. So if you hit a long winning streak you'll win more and more points for example.  Then, the game will check if your rank match your mmr, and give you more points or less in order to be where you belong on the ladder.  So all you can do is improve and win more than 50% of your games. Good luck with that :)"
NexusNewbies,3bst38,henrax,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:29:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think the system will give you less points based on your mmr individually.  Someone way back made a post that tried to explain how it worked, but basically it was something like this:  -if you team and the enemy team has the same average MMR, whoever wins gets 100 points.  -whichever team had higher MMR gets less than 100 for winning and loses more than 100 for losing -if the system thinks your rank should be higher based on your MMR, you'll get the skill bonus rank points -the uncertainty level comes in your first X matches (where X is undisclosed) but it can come also in cases of long winning streaks (in which case your MMR will rise faster than your rank) -lastly, matchmaking will try to match based on MMR and not rank (that's why a lot of people complain that they are rank X and are paired up with rank Y) trying to even out matches for 5 minutes. If no match was found, the search is broadened and will include people with varied MMR"
NexusNewbies,3bt1jc,randomechoes,4,Wed Jul 1 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Unless your group is full of healers, your Melee and Assassin teammates are making a mistake leaving a lane to you alone.  Maybe a good time to ask someone to jump from a full lane to help you out?   If nobody answers, then you could jump into the lane and flee to your teammate's lanes if you get overwhelmed.  Although soaking lane XP early on is important, healers are much more useful when they have teammates to heal."
NexusNewbies,3bt1jc,Siegfoult,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:27:43 2015 UTC,OK that makes sense.  I've been hesitant to talk on chat since I feel that I have no idea what I'm talking about and didn't want to say something stupid.  Next time I'll mention something.

NexusNewbies,3bt1jc,cooldeadpunk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"Unless your running some crazy strat capturing objectives, psuhing with golems/dk/etc or on BoE, you always want at least one person in each lane until lv 10."
NexusNewbies,3bt1jc,BirosHS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:29:21 2015 UTC,"You can ping yourself asking for assistance. Hopefully somebody is going to realize that you are alone as a healer in that  lane and will help you out. If I play with a hero other than a support I am more than happy if I have a healer on my side during early game laning. :)  If nobody comes, stay in lane to soak XP until level 10 and play really passively try not to die. Use the towers smart to clear the opponent minion waves.  If the towers are in danger you should really start spamming the ping on yourself.  If still nobody responses, probably you have bad teammates and it's highly possible you are going to loose the game anyway. So it's no problem if you give up the lane and start support your teammates."
NexusNewbies,3bt1jc,JeepCrew,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:42:07 2015 UTC,"As a big fan of Lili and support/healers/specialists, this is a sad reality we live in. Ping yourself asking for assistance (press g, click and drag down on the minimap or your location) may help.  If you see everyone waiting at the gates at the start of a match, just say something in chat. Let them know you're a healer (they may not know your hero at all) and that you can't take a lane solo.  Unfortunately solo queueing is really hit or miss and very dependent on your teammates. You have the ability to make up for errors and bad decisions since you can heal and protect but you can't win by yourself.  Sometimes your teammates just don't care or just want to do what they want and nothing you do will stop you from losing.  If that happens, just forget about it at the end and move on."

NexusNewbies,3bt408,Yahmahah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:46:26 2015 UTC,"The key difference between Arthas and other Warriors is that he lacks any form of direct escape, so you'll have to play more careful about not overextending. He can be pretty good in roam squads with a Kerrigan, Tyrande, Uther, or another warrior thanks to both his root and his aoe slow. Team fights I'm not great with, but I think you should stay close to your team. You don't have as strong of an engage as Anub or Tyrael, so you can't really dive in, but his E can do good damage if everyone is close together, and his W is pretty good in the middle of a wombo combo.  So it basically depends on style. If you like to passively lane, try to stay a bit farther back, if you're a bit more aggressive, try to roam with another stun/high burst for early kills. And in team fights try to stay close to your team."
NexusNewbies,3bt408,haelcher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:16:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Since of posted this I've gotten a lot more familiar with him, and I found out that what he lacks in mobility he makes up for with damage and sustain."
NexusNewbies,3bt408,zeohi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:34:27 2015 UTC,Arthas only really shines when you know your limits in every situation. He doesn't have the option to really retreat so you need to make the call as to whether or not you can go HAM on someone. He does an excellent amount of burst damage and a solid amount of sustained damage with his E. The problem is if the fight ends up not being in your favor you're usually dead in the water.
NexusNewbies,3br12e,Ramaladingdongwoop,5,Wed Jul 1 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"The outer structures are Forts, the inner structures near your core are keeps. Taking a fort only gives XP, and makes it easier to access the inner defenses.   At least one keep must be destroyed before you can attack the core, and once an enemy keep is destroyed, your minions in that lane start to spawn with catapults, which are fairly strong units that will out range the the core's defenses. This means the enemy team will have to periodically push the lane back to keep their core safe."
NexusNewbies,3br12e,jmknsd,4,Wed Jul 1 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"Note that it is possible to destroy a keep without destroying a fort, but both the fort and the keep have to be down to do damage to the core.

This tends to Mimic other popular MOBAS, ""Inhibitors"" in LoL, if destroyed, begins to spawn Super Minions in that lane. In DOTA2, killing ""Melee or Ranged Barracks"" makes the associated minions in your lane more powerful. These are similar to the concept of keeps in HOTS :)"

Like evenom, it gets almost useless and if you have another viable talent at this tier I think you shouldn't take B4B or evenom.  For Sylv Cold Embrace is better than B4B imo, but Evenom is still the best of its tier for her I think. Kerrigan is the one suffering the most imo, her other talents are so bad."

I've only taken b4b a handful of times on Sylv, and I doubt I'll take it again now that the utility is far lessened. It was marginal at best and if you want to gank or solo there are far better heroes than Sylv."
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,cloral,3,Wed Jul 1 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"You had the right idea... In all honesty, 4 levels is extremely difficult to come back from late in the game (but don't give up!).    I think the best action is to clear minion waves, soak XP, clear camps, and only engage enemy if you have ALL 5 of your teammates against less than 5 enemies."
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,ckax,2,Wed Jul 1 16:31:44 2015 UTC,This and also perhaps to pick off any out of position if you can without starting a team fight
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,CynicCorvus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"I'd add in that you should avoid team fights as much as possible as well. Obviously you can't let the other team run away with objectives, but don't jump into a fight against a much stronger team for no reason."
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,Sprinklesss,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"If it is just you, go soak! Nothing you can do v 5 of them. It's hard to come back from a huge gap but you have to stay together at that point and hope to pick off heroes one at a time."
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,Boobtape,2,Wed Jul 1 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"In general, map awareness and positioning are key.   Clearing lanes is good, but it has the drawback of telling the enemy where you are. If you let them know where you are, with a 4 level advantage they can simply rotate and crush you. So you have to be careful that you are close enough to safety, or that they are busy.   Splitting in to 2 or 3 groups to soak is extremely risky, and you basically shouldn't push out past a fort/keep.  If there are mercs you can take safely, then those should be prioritized because they allow you to stay out of the enemies sight. But if your mercs are the only objective available on the map, you need to be more careful because the enemy team will likely engage there.  It's not always a clear answer when you are extremely behind. Someone like Abathur or murky is super useful here because they can not only soak, but push lanes out, and get you some vision on the map."
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,jmknsd,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"Map control is key. Don't engage in team fights, let them have 1-2 kills and keep lanes pushed out a little but don't overextend.  Have your assassin/Dps focu on the squishy. Set up a kill order or at least one person to focus first. That might let you get the advantage on a team fight.  Try to set up a trap, lead someone that is overly aggressive into an ambush. You don't have to kill, just mame... Donny never wanted to kill... Anyway. By jumping them you'll scare them into staying grouped.  When they stay grouped you can get camps, gaining XP and map control.  Don't try to push one lane, you'll over extend and lose. Push all the lanes, kill all the towers.  Unlike League, pushing towers early helps gain and advantage. These towers have a limited number of shots. Forcing someone to sit on their tower is great (vice versa, it's bad for you to do it)."
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,Spe333,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"It really depends. You can be down on levels, but otherwise doing well. If the team is really trying and still failing, I'll stick with it. If the team is failing because they just don't understand the game, the map, and their heroes, then I'll just spin off and do my own thing, and patiently wait for the end. Just being honest. :P"
NexusNewbies,3brhwr,HaiKarate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:52:32 2015 UTC,"At that point, I think it's best to switch to a defensive strategy. Try to push out some lanes a bit to relieve pressure and soak XP. Deny merc camps on your side of the map to relieve pressure and also provide some of your own.    And make sure you're ready for a team fight. The most important thing to remember at this stage in the game is that if your team loses the next teamfight, it's GG. So stick together, maybe give people some kill instructions or plan your stun...    last night I was in this situation on the Raven curse map and we had an amazing comeback thanks to some very clutch play from everyone involved, excellent team fighting and surviving. that allowed us to take the boss and push the enemy core for a win"

NexusNewbies,3bqw08,pranavbijwe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:36:52 2015 UTC,Are you playing on NA?
NexusNewbies,3bqw08,Seel007,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, since Singapore is a part of the ""Americas"" region."
NexusNewbies,3bqw08,Seel007,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:21:24 2015 UTC,Looks like you already have it fixed but I was gonna suggest maybe switching to EU.
NexusNewbies,3bqw08,Ph0Mai,0,Thu Jul 2 06:11:54 2015 UTC,I feel your pain my friend.   I believe that matchmaking chooses the server based on where the people in the game are from.  If there are more people from NA then it'll put you in NA.   I have the same problem playing in SEA. I think the key problem is Blizzard really doesn't give a shit about anyone outside their customer base in Europe or NA.  It's understandable as that's where they make the most money but it's still irksome.       The best that you could do is try to get more friends that live in your area to play.  There's no way to force the matchmaking to put you on the Singapore server.
NexusNewbies,3bq4eq,-Saraei-,3,Wed Jul 1 06:24:48 2015 UTC,"I could try to help. Whats the specs on her computer? Please post, cpu, gpu, ram and OS thx"
NexusNewbies,3bq4eq,PilgrimOfGrace,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:28:27 2015 UTC,"I'll find out when she wakes up, thanks!"
NexusNewbies,3bq4eq,PilgrimOfGrace,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:31:48 2015 UTC,"Ok here it is-  AMD E2-3000M APU with radeon HD graphics 1.80 GHz  4GB RAM  Windows 7 Home Premium  64 bit  Model- HP Pavilion g6 Notebook  She had no issues running Diablo 3 on it, but seems to get high MS on hearthstone and heroes. Can't work out why!"
NexusNewbies,3bq4eq,angrmgmt00,2,Wed Jul 1 09:10:58 2015 UTC,"Are you sure its not MS thats low but the actual frame rate of the game? The system requirements for this game via their official website exceed what your sisters computer actually has. Her CPU is only 2 cores at 1.8ghz which is very very very slow. This is the kind of speed that was fast over 7 years ago. The requirements for the game are for a 4 core. So with 2 less cores than you should have to run this, the game is going to be choppy. Also, she has no graphics card in an old chip. Put all her settings in the videos option to lowest, then load up training and hit Ctrl-Alt-F on the keyboard, the frames per second will show up in the top left corner. It is probably a low number."
NexusNewbies,3bq4eq,angrmgmt00,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:21:15 2015 UTC,"All settings on lowest, she is 50-60 FPS on home screen, around 40 in training.  Took it into vs AI with AI team mates, MS started off fine but rapidly went up."
NexusNewbies,3bq4eq,angrmgmt00,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:32:57 2015 UTC,"How does she connect to her router?  If she's using a wireless adapter, that could be one potential problem.  Wireless is a neat technology, but it's far from perfect.  It's also possible that she's connecting to a server very far from where she lives.  The following article can help you identify which server she's connected to (after using the command ""netstat -a"" in a command line) and how long the ping time is.  https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/performing-a-traceroute  Finally, make sure she's not running any other applications like torrent clients, background downloaders, VOIP clients, etc.  While many of these programs are designed to have a low latency impact, some of them can be a bit greedy with bandwidth (Skype, I'm looking at you).  Just as a pedantic aside, the ping time or latency is measured in milliseconds (ms), not megasiemens (MS), which is a measurement of electrical conductance."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,ProfXanthos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"His laning is pretty weak against ranged that do some kind of burst damage. Basically, you just want to soak hard till 10, so you can combo with your teammates to eliminate a target in a fight instantly.  Octo grab is just better than march, march has a delay and does just pitiful damage if your enemies do not grab 3-4 murlocs. Also they can be easily dodged, and the cooldown is massive.   Octo grab on the other hand just provides a huge single target stun that forces a cleanse/escape if you find them out of position. Also it allows follow-up into a quick 4 v 5 as your target is basically deleted and hopeless.  Bribe is decent at level 1, however, getting block is most of the time more efficient. It gives you stronger laning power and teamfight potential due to not getting instantly 2 shotted by a huge ad assassin like butcher, zera, nova or hammer.   Bubble build for talents is generally subpar due to 1 reason, you are so reliant on your cds to keep alive, bubble cd can be reduced and make sure you live longer. However, if you do not provide enough of a threat, you do not have a presence in teamfights, with smaller puffer aoe, people would easily run out after getting cleansed or just take the damage and retreat if you are going a more defensive build. Having the extra 400-600 damage at level 13/16 is more valuable than just surviving the fight and being annoying."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,harrydesmart,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:25:37 2015 UTC,"So my current updated build to try tonight: 1. Block 4. Living the Dream (or Tufferfish if other team will bank me often) 7. Compressed Air 10. Octo-grab 13. Wrath of Cod (accidentally typed ""ocd"") 16. Slimy Pufferfish 20. ... And A Shark Too!"
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,harrydesmart,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"The ult upgrade can be easily replaced by rewind, actually it's better to get rewind in most scenarios. It rounds out the 50-60s cd timer very well, and the damage cannot be cleansed off.   It provides much more pressure with 2x puffers that 1 shot and a nice slime>puffslime>slime>puffslime>ult>slime combo that does over 4k damage if everything goes off.  Overall, the 300 damage from the ult upgrade is just meagre compared to the benefits of the overall survivability and aoe potential of rewind."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,tundranocaps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:59:54 2015 UTC,"900 damage from the ult, it's 300 per second for 3 seconds. But Rewind actually comes ahead on damage, yes."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,harrydesmart,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:53:42 2015 UTC,It's actually 100 damage per hit x 3. You can check it if you want.   The only damage increase you get from ult other than the upgrade is the 15% damage buff from living the dream.
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,tundranocaps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"It's actually 100 damage per hit x 3. You can check it if you want.   Just verified, it's 300 * 3. Makes sense, since regular Octo-Grab is 1 damage times 3, and Shark increases it by 30k%, or 300, per hit, or a total of 3 to 900. Also, if it were 300 total, it really wouldn't be worthy of a level 20 talent :3"
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,harrydesmart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"This was a undocumented change. It was previously 100 x 3. As it was 10,000% damage increase, making it 300 damage.  Either it's bugged as they added in multiple hits 10k x 3 x 3 hits, or it's a change that wasn't listed. But that's just stupid."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,tundranocaps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"The current tooltip clearly says it's 30,000% damage increase. So it's not a bug. They just hotfixed something about Murky's heroic. And it's 3 strikes of 300, not multiple of 100. Also, it's an upgraded single target Heroic that can be cleansed. Nova's Triple Tap deals 770 damage per shot at level 20, for comparison."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,harrydesmart,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:49:27 2015 UTC,"Undocumented change. Talent info still lists 10,000% damage increase. It's only when you talent into it and hover over tooltip does it show 30,000%.   Regardless, it's still pretty shit if rewind is an option."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,tundranocaps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:26:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, you meant ""shit"" like that. Yes, I think Rewind is the much better option as well. At least/especially if you get the Pufferfish talents at levels 13-16."
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,DFxVader,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:29:16 2015 UTC,Here's a Murky Gameplay/Build/Walkthrough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3smoMhLE2xw  Only thing to note is that you should be placing your pufferfish down before using Octograb :-O
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,DFxVader,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:46:41 2015 UTC,Thank you. I did a YouTube search on Murky to try and watch the updated Murky videos. I plan on trying a few different builds to see what works for me at my play level ... Casual in QM.
NexusNewbies,3bq0lr,cookswagchef,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"That's a good call, I try to make all my videos easy builds to play at a casual level. There's lots of viable ways to play Murky in quick match so keep trying builds :)"

NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,Elloba,3,Tue Jun 30 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"I've only played one free week's worth of heroes (have bought two on top of that) so I don't have much exposure to Murky, but he seems kind of unique, can anyone give me an overview of him?"
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,eaglessoar,5,Tue Jun 30 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"Check out MFPallytime's vids, they give a good overview of heroes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOcvzyTbFTg"
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,jayme0227,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you ! I didn't know this channel, really instructive. I often use Grubby's channel for guide but it's limited in content as he's streaming games most of the time."
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,eaglessoar,2,Wed Jul 1 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"No problem, he's great and I want him to keep producing great content so the more people watching him the better. Don't forget to subscribe to his channel!"
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,jayme0227,2,Wed Jul 1 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"I bought Murky on Saturday and I can tell you this much: there's nothing more satisfying than using octograb on Illidan right after he ults into the middle of your team.  He's a lot of fun to play, and trying to find good places to put your egg without having the opponent team find it is half the fun of playing him. Also, just because it's ""ok"" for Murky to die a lot doesn't mean you should play like an idiot. You still should try not to die, though if you can have a 1:1 trade with an enemy hero you should pretty much always take it (unless it's TLV or another Murky)."
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,Captaincastle,2,Tue Jun 30 18:12:45 2015 UTC,Why is it OK for him to die? His deaths count as less or something right?
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,jayme0227,3,Tue Jun 30 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"As long as his egg is alive, his deaths only give a quarter of the experience of a typical hero death and he revives in 5 seconds. This affords him the ability to get more aggressive as the game goes on because a simple trade hurts the enemy more than it will hurt him. But, like I said, you shouldn't be an idiot about it. You still enemies experience when you die and you still end up out of position for some amount of time as you cross the map to get back to the team fight."
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,mediEvil,2,Tue Jun 30 18:40:11 2015 UTC,"His deaths actually always give .25, you just don't respawn faster without your egg"
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,YoloSand,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:48:22 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thanks!
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,Talashandy,2,Thu Jul 2 13:07:35 2015 UTC,I have never seen my son so excited about a HotS update as when he saw this. Came and found me immediately to tell me about it.
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,ProfXanthos,2,Tue Jun 30 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks blizzard, now do the same thing for Abathur please !"
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,XunTzu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:45 2015 UTC,I spent 10k on both of them and have no regrets. Both are totally worth it. :)
NexusNewbies,3bn2ug,Captaincastle,2,Wed Jul 1 00:20:58 2015 UTC,"Of course I paid 10,000 three days before this. Oh well, I'm really enjoying him / her / ... The little Murloc. So I can't really complain. I'm having fun and still winning more than I was before. This could be my style in game."
NexusNewbies,3botft,asher1611,7,Tue Jun 30 22:54:51 2015 UTC,I really like Sylvanas. She has super fast waveclear and if let alone can push pretty hard.  Also she is so squishy that you definitely want to stay behind your tank in teamfights. Keeps me on my toes all the time.
NexusNewbies,3botft,epaphos,2,Wed Jul 1 07:33:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the super satisfying part about Sylvanas is following a teamfight win, just run all the camps and clear all the lanes in under a minute. With a proper build, you can just hold down Q in lane and the passive shuts down most camps from attacking.  It's helpful if your team is smart and doesn't waste time helping you clear camps bc let's face it, Sylvanas can solo anything but the boss (since passive doesn't apply).  I'm still only Lv7 with her so I haven't fully mastered the Wailing Arrow. But even without it, in most 1v1/gank situations, I'll just use W (with vuln), blast a full set of Q, then if they're still a threat I can E to safety and they usually have to base. Then proceed to push lane."
NexusNewbies,3botft,creamcityjw,5,Wed Jul 1 20:32:21 2015 UTC,"Murky man. He's just hilarious, and being a dedicated troll is awesome.   Plus wombo comboing an illidan who tries to gank you is immensely satisfying"
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,2,Wed Jul 1 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"I second Murky. He's an absolute blast. From running at someone dead on and watching them run away, to taking down that damn Zeratul that kept harrassing me at the beginning of the game. Murky is a giant pain in the ass and that's what makes him so fun. Mrglrglrgl."
NexusNewbies,3botft,Talashandy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:14:25 2015 UTC,Plus his murloc army heroic is stupid funny
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,2,Wed Jul 1 01:09:50 2015 UTC,What do you do to counter Illadin? I just started with Murky ... 5 QM so far. I like him but basically had to run from an Illadin / Valla in the top lane.
NexusNewbies,3botft,ProfXanthos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:21:06 2015 UTC,"Before octo grab you just gotta hope his blink is on cooldown when you're bubbling away. After octo, you wombo combo. Slime puffer octo grab. If you don't have shark yet it won't kill him at full life, but if anyone else is around that dude is dead.  Edit - I'm far from anything impressive playerwise so don't only take my word for it lol"
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,0,Wed Jul 1 05:23:03 2015 UTC,I was trying to figure out Murky's rotation of abilities in a fight. Why that order? I've been doing lots of harassing and moving my egg around to keep the enemy guessing.  Bribe? Pufferfish or Bubble build?  Why Octo-grab over Marchh? Doesn't seem to do much damage until level 20 shark.
NexusNewbies,3botft,ProfXanthos,2,Wed Jul 1 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"BTW, if you can manage the keys, rewind is better than shark for level 20, where pufferfish + 2 slimes + octograb about equal slime + puffer + shark, and the 2nd puffer adds a lot more damage."
NexusNewbies,3botft,tundranocaps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"If you drop a fish before you octo-grab, the person will get hit with it - also, if it's during a team fight and your team doesn't suck, whoever you grab should get focused"
NexusNewbies,3botft,byrel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:49:18 2015 UTC,"Slime first to slow, drop your fish to set up, octo grab.  They are slimed, take the puffer hit to the face, and then when octo runs out you can slime again then aa.  If you have shark they should be dead after octo.  I like bribe, because free siege camps are awesome. The bubble option is my fallback, i haven't tried block yet.  Octograb is just more reliable. Take their support or tank out of a fight and everyone is gonna jack up their assassins. The march is hilarity incarnate, but much harder to make work."
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:01:08 2015 UTC,"Tell me more about murky. Like, how do you actually play him? For example, MFPT uses him mainly for harassing/distracting/CC the enemy team but mostly for siege damage. I have a friend who says he plays him like an assassin."
NexusNewbies,3botft,mediEvil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"I just push a lane usually, until we start getting towards 10 then I'll roam a little, usually keeping an eye on lanes to make sure we're not losing xp.  I like to try and hit the little duels and help finish kills or block for escaping teammates, or nail objectives. If I'm using bribe I'll try and take siege camps.  I just try to stay liquid. You can't really assassinate people til you get your shark, but you can fuck up a team fight with puffer fish"
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,3,Wed Jul 1 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Brightwing! She's so ridiculously sadistic and if you're halfway decent your team will love the hell out of you. Also, her purchasable skins are hilarious. you can be a butterfly or a god damned flying monkey. And a support. Everyone loves a good support."
NexusNewbies,3botft,moorlu,6,Wed Jul 1 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Her voice is fantastic. ""Do you wanna take this merc camp? Because I doooo..."" makes me drop whatever I'm doing for a merc camp."
NexusNewbies,3botft,AC_Mobius,4,Wed Jul 1 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"""You know bw, i do want to kill those mercs"""
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,3,Wed Jul 1 11:42:25 2015 UTC,That flying monkey creeps me out
NexusNewbies,3botft,Captaincastle,3,Wed Jul 1 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of fun with Zeratul and Tyrande as a combo. We will roam and my buddy will use Tyrande to bait people off and bring them to me. Then we ""Drop the D"" as we call it, by putting hunters mark at the enemy then taking them down. It is quite fun."
NexusNewbies,3botft,mediEvil,3,Wed Jul 1 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"I've been having a lot of fun with Rehgar. He's just so versatile: heals, shields, slowing totem and he can hold his own in a fight as well. Not to mention instantly turning ghost wolf and leg it (or charge in).   Plus once in a while it's great to just pick Bloodlust instead of Ancestral Healing and hear the WRAAHRARRARARGH, and see your allies just Hulking out."
NexusNewbies,3botft,Frunzle,3,Wed Jul 1 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"I've only just started but one thing I love about HotS so far (coming from LoL) is ALL the heroes I've tried so far are fun, even LiLi support last week, the heals are great, I love having double dragons out and doing some damage and the ult with the cups is just awesome, and people always love a support!  Sonya is a blast, love spin to win and her W is fun to spam, plus hitting great Qs feels awesome. Muradin is a blast to just jump into the center of a fight pop your Avatar and just start fucking shit up, or catching people running with your Q. Those are the two heroes I bought. At first I hated Zagarra but learned to love her dropping mutas on people and raining down Q. Anub is a blast too, popping people up and then chasing them down to stun them, I love catching people of guard or escaping. The only one I didn't really enjoy was ETC but I didn't play him enough.  So far this week I've only played Falstad and he's a good time. I cant really get a hang of when to use his E except for escaping. He's an assassain so I don't want to dive in with it, I guess it's good for chasing. His Q is super fun though and his first ult is so satisfying to hit on a bunch of people. I really like his lightening W too.  Sorry I don't know skill names, just buttons :)"
NexusNewbies,3botft,eaglessoar,3,Wed Jul 1 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"I like Uther a bit, and Malfurion. I just like the click-heals and the CC more than what the other supports offer. Neither are exciting, but I like 'em.  Who do I really like? Zeratul is a lot of fun. There's something about blinking to get the last auto-in, being The Predator (note he even looks like him), is just sort of cool.  I too really liked Nazeebo and Thrall from last week. And I enjoyed Chen quite a bit too. I dunno, I just never really clicked with the other specialists, but Nazeebo's ambling run which I hate on D3 (though the female WD is even worse) is funny, and it's so nice to get kills after dying or to bait people with the wall and then drop a gargantuan in there with them :D  Chen is fun to play. Screw good, but just leaping around and being a nuisance is fun. Thrall just feels to me like a much better Sonya. Just run in, unload damage, run out. The Butcher seems like he might obviate him, but the Butcher also feels overtuned right now...  The final one is Jaina. I just really feel powerful playing her, constantly hitting people and stopping them from running away, or dropping a huge combo on someone while still being safer than someone like Kerrigan. Can't do Kael'Thas, but Jaina's my gal.  I plan to buy Murky now that his cost's reduced, hope I like him too. For HL, I have to make do with some champions I don't care for all that much, but still trying things out. I didn't like Zagara in my 2nd week in the game, but haven't really tried her much since, and then I did better with Sgt. Hammer and even better with Nazeebo, so maybe my increased game knowledge will give me a different experience with her now, but she still feels more passive."
NexusNewbies,3botft,tundranocaps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"I also liked Thrall, and will probably buy him. I'm just waiting to see if he goes on sale."
NexusNewbies,3botft,HaiKarate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"He will at some point! Which is why I buy only the champions I ""need"", because the less champions I buy now, the more I'll have what to do if the nerf hammer hits everyone I already own. With zero gold, you can't really react to those changes, and with the prices of things in this game, that can put you out of HL in a competitive manner for a while... Or forcing you to spend money, which I do too for sales/starter pack (off battle.net one).  Also, since Butcher is so similar to him, I'm gonna wait for Butcher to be on rotation and see which I liked more before buying either, I guess, or wait for a sale if it happens first :D"
NexusNewbies,3botft,tundranocaps,3,Wed Jul 1 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"For me it's Li Li, I love just running around and initiating a fight and then my team can come in and wtpwn. People think ""oh its a sup np just kill"" but you get so much satisfaction avoiding the jukes properly with Fast Feet.   I am trying to have fun with Kael but I keep lamenting over the fact that Pyro looks fucking fun but it sucks to cast + land properly."
NexusNewbies,3botft,Boobtape,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"I love Li Li; she can do an amazing amount of heals with her Ult, if you can avoid the interrupts. Many times I've brought the team back in a battle from certain defeat to crushing victory with 1,000 Cups."
NexusNewbies,3botft,HaiKarate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:24:56 2015 UTC,I love the double dragon fun. Especially if there's another sup but jugs + kfh is godlike. I actively try and tank the damage then haha.

As someone who is relatively new to the game, I found there's nothing more satisfying than laying waste to their structures solo.   Level 16? Opponents haven't really been paying attention to their lanes all game? Fuckin' PUSH GAZ, PUSH.   Just the other night, i somehow managed to singlehandedly push through bot and take their core down by myself, it almost felt surreal because that doesn't seem like it should ever happen."
NexusNewbies,3botft,xm00g,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:05:06 2015 UTC,This might work when no one knows what to do against Gazlowe in lane. Enemies won't normally just let you go HAM on a lane. Gazlowe is good for rotating around mercenary camps and securing objectives.

Then follow up with W to lock him in, get behind him and E before he can run away. If ult is up, definite kill.  Pushing lanes is super easy with him if you run in front of the minion wave, throw out zombie wall to aggro turrets and then go to town. It's only feasible if you know the enemy won't come up during the W's CD, but if you can throw down ult as well, tons of dmg and XP."

NexusNewbies,3botft,tpiardi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:42:29 2015 UTC,Cool! I just bought Abathur and am trying him out in QM.  I feel like I have so much to learn.  Any advice for how to play him or resources to look at? I've watched a few videos and all they seem to focus on is somewhat playing a split push build.  I'd like to know more about some of his other styles as well.
NexusNewbies,3botft,tpiardi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well, there are many better Abby players here than me, I will post some tips I got here and there, but I'm no pro abathur.  While I can play abathur solo on qm or even ranked, try to find someone to play with, his strengh grow as your team mates have more awareness of Abathurs powers.  First your main priority is to look for team mates that need help. While you still new to abathur, focus on his survival, with time and experience, you will know when you can push your enemy more and when you need to focus on defense.  You need to learn to read the minimap all the time. Always know where your allies are and try to track your enemies.  Try to use all your toxic nests. They can be used for view points or to make a trap on a key location, like mines entrance, if your enemy step in a bunch of nests, he will be with a good damage in the mines and will have to retreat or be a easy prey for your team.  Positioning can make a huge difference for a good abathur. Find the right place and the right our to hide in a lane will help your siege damage (because your locusts have timed life) and your xp farming. But, wait till you have confidence in your minimap skills, or you can die a lot. Other than that, read every abathur guide on heroesfire and others sites and try a lot, there is lots of builds for him, you can damage, you can heal, you can siege, you can set traps with the nests... with monstrosity you can even hunt enemy heroes, with simbiose and 30 stacks, it can do 2x1 most of the heroes."

NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,HardlyARiot,6,Tue Jun 30 18:11:28 2015 UTC,"Only real advice I can give ya is to focus on playing her as a ""long range assassin support"" cuz that's what you are, you support your assassins in getting that clutch kill by either throwing an owl at the back of their head or using lunar flare (either hitting them for the stun or putting it in front of them so they have to alter their path, allowing your allies to catch up). Due to this getting close enough to use your trait is, well, pretty rare unless you get jumped.  Straight up though, if you can't land your skillshots then you will play a bad Tyrande regardless of team composition or skill selections; she is very dependent on those hitting semi-reliably.  Beyond that, and assuming you're solo support, focus on how much healing and self-sustain your team has. It would be prudent to forgo an owl build if doing a solo support since you can boost your healing at lvl.1 and get protective shield at lvl.4.  So Tl;Dr is to not suck at skillshots and, when solo support, suck it up and go for a healing build; not the best heals but you can provide some while helping ensure long-distance kills like the other supports can't."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,silverhydra,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"Queue with another healer. When solo Queueing with Tyrande you can often end up with her as the only support on your team against a rehgar, uther, or malfurion and Tyrande is not a full healing support like they are."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,DFxVader,-1,Wed Jul 1 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there is a way.  It's really disappointing but right now Tass and Tyrande are not viable in solo QM. So if you just want to practice it's fine but if you want to win games, the match making makes it so you will face healers like brightwing or Malfurion and you can't do much against that. Basically taking Tyrande in QM is starting with a big disadvantage.   The best imo would be to find a friend who plays support so you're certain to have a true healer in your team. Tyrande with Rehgar or Uther is really good.  Even in HL it's hard to find a good spot for Tyrande these days.  Edit : I didn't say that she was not fun to play or not useful. Tyrande is a great hero, but by playing her in QM you deprive your team of a healer, which is missing a great asset. The problem is not the hero but the way team comp are made in QM."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,henrax,2,Tue Jun 30 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree that they aren't viable in QM. I played Tyrande last night against a Lili and we did just fine. Its how a person plays, not necessarily the comp. She's a blast to play and most definitely brings a lot to a team.   Please don't discourage people from heroes by saying they aren't viable. Its QM and people should play what they enjoy."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,Talashandy,3,Tue Jun 30 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that she can be made to work in other setups, but she shines with a support. It's worth checking if someone in your group wants to play a full healer."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,d20diceman,0,Tue Jun 30 23:57:33 2015 UTC,"Of course you can have a lot of fun with her. I love Tyrande and play her a lot, in QM and in HL (she's my most played hero with brightwing). What I'm saying is that currently, having a healer in your team is a great asset. Playing Tyrande in QM allows the enemy to have one while you don't (she is not a healer, even if she has other very utilities), so you start with a small disadvantage.   Once again, I didn't say she was not fun or you were doomed from the beginning. It's just that the way matchmaking works leads to Tyrande having a bad winrate in QM. And Lili is probably the worst healer so Tyrande vs Lili is still manageable. But Tyrande vs brightwing is often not pretty."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,henrax,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:39:47 2015 UTC,"Lili is actually a pretty good healer for QM, where people mostly don't try to stop her ult.  Also, she's insane at 20. To top it off she's really easy to play.   My winrate with lili in QM is just as high as with Rehgar,  my other favorite support.   I'll grant you that with the blind being her only utility,  she's weaker than the rest in ranked play."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,levinho,2,Wed Jul 1 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"Yes she is, especially at low mmr. But Tyrande vs Lili is not too much in Lili's advantage because Tyrande's stun is very good against lili's heroic. It's quite easy to stop it."
NexusNewbies,3bnq6k,henrax,2,Wed Jul 1 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"I have been having a lot of fun with Tassadar in QM. As long as your team can survive pretty well on their own, you can do a high DPS build and take Healing Ward and you can help with healing while still doing a lot of damage. Tassadar is a Support, but he is in no way a Healer. He more is built to just support one person at a time by helping their damage output and negating some of the damage they take."
NexusNewbies,3bmuns,dgvertz,9,Tue Jun 30 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"yeah so.   a long time ago, everyone on reddit decided watch tower was a bad idea.   then everyone on reddit decided that follow stupid was the best thing to do.   you have nothing else to do in that first minute. if your composition is gank/poke friendly, you might as well try to get an initial kill in or at least damage them to the point they need to use the fountain.

NexusNewbies,3bmuns,kataxist,5,Tue Jun 30 14:36:59 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.  You have nothing to soak in the first 30 seconds, so if your team is posturing for the vision, then support them.  In a pug if they are going in with or without you are are better supporting them to try and salvage a win or an even trade instead of a total loss.  It's less about the importance of the vision and more about the importance of team play in a team game.  use chat, pings, whatever to make your intentions known and support your allies, because no 1 person is going to win a match on your own, regardless of how ""right"" you are."

NexusNewbies,3bmuns,henrax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"It's nice if you can have a kill at the beginning of a game but it is really useless. It grants almost no xp (less than a wave of creeps) and that's only if can manage to have one kill. So if you see that your team is going all in on the watch tower follow them cautiously but :   Always have someone bot since you probably won't have the time to go back to bot before the first creep wave arrives. On Backheart's Bay go heal if you need to so you are ready for the first chests at 50s.   I have the impression that when you go up in ranks / mmr, those fights are less and less frequent since the vision is not very useful in the first minute or so of the game."
NexusNewbies,3bmuns,asher1611,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:24:13 2015 UTC,I try and remind my teammates to not die for the WT and to get back to lanes once there is XP to soak.  Usually they listen.
NexusNewbies,3bmuns,DFxVader,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:30 2015 UTC,The key is to try and get a quick kill and not over extend. There's nothing wrong with realizing you're not getting a kill or the vision and just backing out to lanes as they start to hit the middle.
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,eaglessoar,9,Tue Jun 30 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"Why do 4 go top and 4 go bottom on the mines map?   The idea on the Mines is to out-push your enemy, more so than any other map. Why? Because when the golem rise, the less buildings it has to destroy, the closer it will get to the core.  What you should do is this:  1) evaluate which team has the stronger push. 2) If it is your team, then go 4 in your golem's lane and try to get some siege damage before the mines are up. 3) If it is the enemy, you will probably need 3 or 4 defending their golem's lane to avoid taking too much siege damage   How does this transition to when the mines open?   Everybody should go to the mines. Try to use the same entrance to avoid being picked out one by one. Someone can go outside to soak some XP depending on the circumstances (e.g. enemy team is wiped)   How do you decide who goes solo?   If we are talking lanes early game, I think the best is to leave a hero with a safe wave clear (like Tassadar), so s/he can hold the lane alone.   What is their job when their solo?   Soak XP and not die. If the enemy team seems to be outpushing yours, call for reinforcements.   Should I be killing the golem or helping mine push? How do I know when to do which?   Rule of thumb: is your golem stronger? Push. Otherwise, defend. If you have a Sylvanas in the game, then use the other rule of thumb: push if she is your team, defend if not.  Disclaimer: all of those are guidelines, there's no golden rule to what you should be doing at every moment. With experience you will learn to evaluate on the fly on the go where killing what :)"

NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,ChaosManifesto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"I do want to add that ideally your 4 man lane should take down a tower or two. When the first mine event starts, most games have teams at lvl 3 on each side, but with tower exp that gives a team a lvl advantage as well as the lvl 4 talent tree advantage.  polak is right in that its about pushing, but the 4:1's ""ideal"" goal is to get two towers or even the gate before the mine event starts so that they have lvl + talent advantage leading to an ultimate win"
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,N8CCRG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:15 2015 UTC,"1) evaluate which team has the stronger push   What are some things that determine this? Do you mean solely on hero comp (and if so, what comps are stronger push than others?), or are there other factors as well?"
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,bsmntdwlr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"Strong solo pushers are heroes that have mechanics especially suited to bring down buildings and eradicate lane minions by the wave.  This includes all Specialists and a few others, (like Raynor, Kerigan, Tassadar and Sonya).  Most of these characters, if supported by their team, can quickly drain ammo, destroy structures and eradicate whole minion waves.  As an example, Sylvanas, Azmodan, Johanna and Kael, will absolutely push down a fort without any problems if there isnt immediate and sizeable response"
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,bsmntdwlr,6,Tue Jun 30 23:14:13 2015 UTC,"This is my take on the mines, YMMV:  The purpose of the 1/4 split is to send 1 person to defend your towers, this should be a strong solo hero like Muradin, Brightwing, Raynor or Zigara, someone who can poke and push from range or someone who can self heal quickly.  The purpose of the solo person is to 1) Not die, 2) prevent the towers from falling, 3) Not die.  Simply put, your only job is the deny the enemy team any XP but minion clears.  The 4-person lane needs to be a power-pushing lane. It should be stacked with heavy siege like Azmodan, Sylvanas, Raynor along with some heals or CC to keep them healthy or ranged DPS like Kael/Nova/Vala to push back their defenders.  The purpose of this lane is the opposite of the 1 man lane.  Their whole goal is to push down the towers/fort to get an XP advantage prior to first mines phase.  The most successful application of this nets the friendly team a 1 level advantage (and 1 talent advantage) for the first mines phase.  Edit: many people are saying the point is to get a better golem starting position.  While this is a benefit, the actual goal is the XP advatage.  If you can push the Xp advantage that sets you up for a better teamfight, which sets up a skull advantage which sets you up to push with your golem, which means your stronger golem gets more done... it's all about getting the early XP lead and riding it as far as you can and letting it snowball to victory.  Once the mine's pop (i.e. ~15-seconds to mine open), the 1 man off-lane should join the 4 man lane to enter the mines as a solid 5-man unit.  From there, you generally have 3 options:   If the enemy team doesn't immediately enter the mines, you want to fan out and have every member of your team solo 1 skull camp.  Priority should be given to the 2 middle camps on the left hand side of the mines as they have the most skulls.  You should only do this if you are confident you can clear camps and regroup before the enemy team can gank someone. If the enemy team pushes into mines immediately, If you are up a level/talent tier or are even-level and have the better team-fight potential i would force a teamfight and try and gain a manpower advantage to force them out of the mines.  If you are behind a level/have a worse teamfight i would try and grab ~40 safe skulls and then retreat to prevent feeding and start work on jungle (in order: their siege->neutral bruisers->your siege) In the late game, your third option is to abandon mines entirely and go for the hard push.  If you can knock down a keep (or two) while they are in mines, this is essentially a free-trade.  Their strong golem will absolutely take out your buildings before you can kill it, so you simply take theirs while they are busy farming skulls.  This is risky so should only be used if you are behind/respawning at mines pop and are unable to properly contest it.   Other things to keep in mind: You want to capture your siege camp as the first golem is passing their gate/mine entrance, this way your siege will engage and help DPS their golem.  Siege giants do very good damage against the golem and can free up DPS for pushing on your ofensive lane.  Know when you GTFO. If you gain 40-60 skulls early, you may want to consider abandoning the mines to jungle or push lanes.  If you are in a weak position/over-extended Dont push for a 60+ skull golem if it will cost you deaths to achieve.  Feeding an XP or manpower advantage for minimal gains is never a good idea.  If both teams are coming out of mines, don't contest bruisers.  They aren't going to net as much as siege camps & your simple lane presence.  Most of this advice assumes organized play, and most of this advice is the ""popular"" approach.  I would actually advise working on counters to these strategies to be effective against the customary approach (like going 3-2, 3 to defend against the 4 man rush, and 2 to gank/counter-push their 1 man lane, for example)"

NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,nochroot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"Muradin can engage, CC, deal some damage/disrupt and then back up behind the wall and self heal to full with very little time between harasses  BWing has self heals, polymorph, ranged damage  Raynor has super long range and can effectively sit behind structures and pour on DPS  The goal isnt to kill their heroes, the goal is to force them back and prevent them from killing your structures.  Gazlowe would be a fine choice, but is fairly weak early game in a 1v4 harass, Azmo and Sylv dont have self sustain at level 1-3 and are much more necessary in the push lane.  Jaina and KT would be fine, but with their low health pools there is little to no margin for error... and again, their DPS would be better suited on the other lane, IMO.  The solo lane is all about defense."
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,creamcityjw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:51:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah with Sylvanas, the key to her push ability is Q+passive. If you solo with her, she doesn't push and can't utilize the passive. When you group and she waveclears, she can shut down one tower.  For those who don't know, her passive prevents attacks from minions, mercs (not boss), and towers. This makes her especially good at clearing merc camps as well.  I haven't had many opps to run Mines with Sylvanas in QM but I'd be interested to see with a good team how far we could push before mines opened."

A good practice IMHO is to clear all the groups, watch for where the enemy team goes, and if they go after the boss, wait a bit for them to shed health and surround them.  So many times my team goes in first and heads right for the boss, they are the ones that get surrounded, and we end up with a 20/80 golem strength disadvantage."
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,Eriennyl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"This is all quite situational, but I've found it works best to put four in your golem lane to try to keep the minion wave back and push down the wall/towers if possible.  In a perfect world, this allows your first golem to potentially get the fort.  When the mines open, if your golem lane is pushed, you have a free trip into the mines unless the enemy responds in kind.  Then it's a race inside.  The solo will usually be someone with good waveclear, or someone with enough sustain to stay alive.  That can slightly offset the lack of bodies.  As for which golem to support, again this is very situational.  I think a good basic assumption is to go to the stronger golem.  You can base the rest of your decision on what the enemy team is doing, and also on what the rest of your team is doing.  If they need you for a teamfight and you're off fooling around, you're wrong.  There's my noob opinion, based on 32 total games in the mines."
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,henrax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:29:23 2015 UTC,"To try to push down the opposing towers/gates so ur golem can walk further in Depends on team comp, if u have a strong gank squad vs the opposing team u can 4v5 in the mines while 1 guy soak the other lane. Or the 1 guy will join the 4s in the other lane and enter together. Strong siege heroes like Sylvanas, Gazlowe, Zagaara, etc will be in the 4s. Tank can go top, I like Falstad soloing top as he can join the 4s in 2 secs by flying so less time wasted travelling. Some will split if there are 2 siege heroes, and that depends on the enemy comp. Like if the enemy has 2 siege heroes and they all push 1 lane, it might be better to just send 4 to counter their 4s. Hard to answer but it depends which team has more siege potential and then react accordingly. Soak, staying alive, stop them from pushing ur towers/gate. Again that depends on ur team comp vs theirs. Which ever has more siege potential, or stronger golem, or who controls the siege/knights camps."

For this point, if your the solo, do you want to go in the mines or try to push back their golem lane as far as possible so their golem cant make it to your fort?  I know it's all very situational (and I love that) but I'm just trying to get a general idea."
NexusNewbies,3bmlu7,Nairin21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"If ur team is capable or handling their 5s then yes u will want to push as far as u could because the siege/knights camp always go opposite of where ur golem is going.   One way is to grab as many small camps in the mines then exit and cap the knights camp while giving up the boss for them. So now they have to worry about both lanes and will have to split their numbers to defend both.  This is of course in a prefect world, u have a 70 skulls golems in lane and knights/giants etc in other lane. You can send like 2 guys to harass them while they try to kill ur golem and ur other guys push their other lane. (After killing their golem of cos since it dies way faster than urs)"
NexusNewbies,3bnv8o,Morander13,3,Tue Jun 30 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"It relies entirely on the data it gets from uploaded replays, and it ignores all vs AI replays.    So if you play a Quick Match with Malfurion who's a level 5 and you upload that game.  Then you play 10 vs AI games with Mal and get him to level 6.  Hotslogs will still think he's level 5 b/c that's the last replay it sees.  (I think that's what your question was.) Also I noticed that it has only calculated about 40% of your games so far, so some of the info may still be in processing.  When you upload a big batch from past weeks like that it will take a while to get through it all.  In general it's not super useful for profile information, but it's really good at statistics.  The MMR is useful NOT for 'ranking up' but for self improvement.  Other things like win rates for each class, or against certain heroes is also good information for yourself to help you improve.  Then having everybody else's statistics is nice so you can see what talents and heroes get picked the most and which one have better win rates, etc."
NexusNewbies,3bnv8o,andraes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply! I appreciate it. This has been where I have been pulling most of the builds I use from since it seems to get better updates than heroesfire.com. I appreciate you explaining it to me. I know this question may sound dumb, but how can you use your MMR to improve? Is MMR your ""skill level rating"" type thing?"
NexusNewbies,3bnv8o,andraes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"Nexus Newbies is the place for questions that may sound dumb!  (though it's not at all a dumb question.) You use MMR as a mirror.  How would you make yourself look better for a date if you couldn't see yourself, right? (dating jokes aside) You use MMR so that you can 'see' yourself and know that you are getting better in a measurable way.  It is a numeric representation of your skill level, it generally works like this: you start playing, the game learns your ability and you get an MMR value.  Then you get matched up against other people of similar skill and you win and lose the same amount (have 50% win rate).  Then your MMR stays at about the same number until you get better or worse and win or lose more games.   Then if you want to increase your skill you can watch VODs, study replays, memorize patch notes, whatever you want to do to try and get better. Then you can see if your MMR goes up as you do those things, and then further decided how to continue improving. (for some people ranking up and improving is a large part of the fun.)"

Which is searching for any changes that have been made to the current version. That's how they also sometimes will show small things in a patch that blizzard does not have listed in their regular patch notes.
NexusNewbies,3blv7v,Eddiero,5,Tue Jun 30 07:18:55 2015 UTC,"Some heroes have very good heroic upgrades, like Nazeebo, Anub'arak, Muradin, Diablo, Malfurion... Heroes that lack escape take bolt (Kael'thas, Jaina, Asmodan...) and storm shield is often very good for support like Rehgar or Brightwing. Also, some heroes have a very good special talent like Lili or Johanna. Nexus blade is also very good on melee assassins.  I think that the best is to check hotslog ans see for each heroe what is the most popular / effective."
NexusNewbies,3blv7v,henrax,2,Tue Jun 30 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the hero, depends on the game?  Nazeebo usually upgrades his Gargantuan heroic, E.T.C. usually upgrades mosh-pit, but if you really need the group shield you can take Storm Shield.  There usually isn't a one-size fits all rule, the level 20 talents are powerful and depend on your composition, hero, and how the game's shaping up thus far.  For Li Li, you usually take Kung Fu Hustle, to keep all your abilities up more often, or 1k jugs for more healing.  You can check HotsLogs to see what other people chose and how it went for them. There often are 2-3 right choices at 20, where neither of them is bad."
NexusNewbies,3blv7v,tundranocaps,2,Tue Jun 30 07:36:21 2015 UTC,"Specifically for Malfurion I would say Storm Shield is a good pick.  Assuming your Tranquility is on cooldown, Storm Shield gives you a nice buffer for your Regrowth to kick in.  Malf has good healing output but lacks burst heals, so that few seconds from the Storm Shield gives you a nice buffer to work with.  Rehgar's Ancestral Healing is amazing, but kind of the same thing - in a pinch you can pop the Storm Shield and give that person with 1% health a second for the Ancestral Healing to kick in.  And we all know how a successful Rehgar ult can swing a teamfight!"
NexusNewbies,3blv7v,phoenixmike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"With Malfurion i consider storm shield almost a must pick, he needs burst healing soooo much that i think its really detrimental to pass it up unless bolt is completely necesary.  Which Rehgar generaly you want rewind, it basically gives you te ability to increase the time frame you have to land the ancestral healing, and landing it goodly can turn around the whole fight"
NexusNewbies,3blv7v,HarrekMistpaw,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:56:21 2015 UTC,"As a very general rule of thumb, if you're winning by a lot, picking the upgraded heroic if it's good usually results in your team pulling farther ahead. The safety talents are always the safest pick because escaping with your life and staying alive longer are almost always the best thing to do whether winning or losing."
NexusNewbies,3blv7v,hacdladf1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:27:17 2015 UTC,As the others have said its really up to the situation you find yourself in. Taking the heroic talent for supports is typically a good idea if you really need the extra healing. Bolt and other movement talents if your finding yourself being focused down before you can use your heroic. Rewind is really good if your able to stay in the back lines and are safe.
NexusNewbies,3blk0j,AC_Mobius,7,Tue Jun 30 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"I feel you should never use Wailing Arrow at the start of team fights unless in some scenario your opponents are already at low health, because it doesn't do much at the start and usually it's tank's job to engage.  What you should do with Wailing Arrow is secure kills by silencing enemy healers and prevent certain heroes from using their key abilities like Illidan for example who can be a nightmare to your team. You can also use it to finish off opponents.  If you use it at the start of a fight, sure it silences them for a bit and does some dmg but more often than not they will deal with it easily and you end up with a wasted heroic."
NexusNewbies,3blk0j,Yoruichi90,3,Tue Jun 30 06:17:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But I will say that if you come across an enemy assassin alone, then you can ambush them with your Heroic, and with your W/envenom/full stack of Qs, you can take them out before they can escape. Its sometimes worth it to take out their DPS for 65seconds.   I also use it for sniping running enemies, or if a cloaked enemy is coming around the back of your team. If your team lacks CC or the CC hero isn't doing his job, it may be worth to use it on enemy heroes who are popping their heroics like Valla or ETC, to negate it. Or if there's a Jaina just save it for her. Without her spells she's a sitting frosty duck."
NexusNewbies,3blk0j,scarred_assassin,3,Tue Jun 30 08:51:02 2015 UTC,"That is one way to use her ult but don't underestimate how much burst and aoe silence can just win a teamfight right as it begins. If your team is very bursty or aoe based and they clump up, silencing them and bursting them with arrow can prevent escapes, cc, and deal enough damage to kill one or two enemies before they can react."
NexusNewbies,3blk0j,scarred_assassin,4,Tue Jun 30 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"To understand when to use a heroic, you have to realize that there is never going to be one specific time to launch it in all games. First, lets look at the three different things of this heroic.   It does Burst. That can be the difference between catching a tank out (or an assassin only slightly out of position) being a bad engage vs a good engage. If you catch out a tank slightly out of position, it is only bad to use cooldowns on it if 1: You can't kill him before the rest of the team arrives, or 2: You can't win the resulting 5v4 without the cooldowns you used AND you can't avoid them while still pushing a 5v4 advantage ( relatively easy on maps like pirate bay where you can pve to win). By having wailing arrow as burst, you can make it so #1 doesn't happen as often, but you want to be careful of #2. This mode is probably best when behind and needing a catch, or when you're sure you have a catch, or when playing a pick comp with a lot of cc.  It silences. This means it can interrupt important heroics or heroes. Heroes that generally hate silences in general include all in assassins like Illidan. It also means that it helps peel of assassins diving your back line (including you). If your team wants to have its back line sit back and kite back enemies, this probably is the best mode to use it in. It also is best to use it this way if you have no one else on your team or no heroics off cooldown that can interrupt important abilities such as lili's thousand cups or ETC mosh pit. It does aoe. This means that the more people that are grouped, the more damage you do. Looking at only this, you would never want to waste arrow on one person, so its important to remember all attributes of your heroic. Since it does aoe, you want to use it on as many people as possible. IN GENERAL, when a teamfight starts is when you are going to see 4 to 5 people stacked up in a small circle. The times when you need to aoe with this heroic are generally when you want to burst the enemy team down, and you don't need the silence or you can burst 1 or more targets down during the silence. If your assassins are looking to dive in and pressure the enemies' back line instead of kiting their front line, this may be the best mode to use IF you are ok with dying to their dive or they have no dive.   TL;DR there really is no one answer. How you use this ult relies on your knowledge of both team comps and the situation at hand. You can maybe realize that you need to save your ult for a mosh pit or a diving illidan, but if you see a catch that only your ult can make, it may be correct to use it then. Remember, in most cases even without your heroic, a 5v4 is hard for them to initiate."

Plus Zeratul, he probably felt like he needed to make 'the plays' and it wasn't going well. Or he's just a d-bag. So mute and move on! Chances to win drop drastically with those kind of players anyway. Check his match history, if he's lost the last 5 HL games that's a telling sign."

You'll be able to gauge really quickly if the abusing player is even worth listening to in game.  I tend to mute, especially if they are saying nothing useful.  Most of what needs to be communicated in game can be done so through pings anyway.  If this was your first HL game, I imagine because of your MMR (match making rating) that this Zeratul was at or near your same level.  You can right click in chat to check the profile.

Team games always have bm, as people are very invested in winning but aren't good enough to get to Rank 1, so they naturally blame other people. I recommend just muting everyone at the start of the game and focusing on your own gameplay and what you should be doing. You learn way more by focusing on yourself than focusing on what your team is supposed to be doing or saying."

I'll call it mental fatigue - I start making poor decisions that I wouldn't normally make because I'm getting a bit worn out.    11 games is a lot to lose in a row, and can be discouraging. I remember playing WoW PVP competitively. Once my arena partners and I would lose more than 2-3 matches in a row, we discovered that we should quit and take a break. We'd start getting frustrated and get too aggressive and communicate less, ""tunnel visioning"" and then increase our losing streak.    I'd chalk it up to having bad luck in QM matchmaking, poor team comps and some new players. That plus not being in the ideal mental state required to play a game this complex.    Try again today!

On the other hand, in both games 2 players were always either laning alone (Anub) or feeding (Raynor), and we lost every team fight because of that (and the other teams were really good for our luck).

NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,CLMoose8,2,Tue Jun 30 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"Boring answer, but this stuff gets better with practice :)   If you're having trouble finding your character, try pressing and holding spacebar. This puts a spotlight on yourself.  As for the mechanical issues, try playing less complicated heroes (Lili, Raynor) first so that you have fewer buttons to press and fewer things to click on. After you get a little more comfortable, push yourself with other heroes/more active skills. If you're not finding AI matches absurdly easy, it might not hurt to play a few more of those instead of QM, just so there's a little less pressure. You don't want to get too used to playing vs AI, but for someone new to Mobas, it doesn't hurt to get familiar there first."
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,mrrreow,2,Tue Jun 30 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"As the other person said it will come to you as you keep playing.  I find it odd that you do better with a + click than right click though...  My normal hand set up is pinky on Q ring on W middle on E pointer on R and thumb on SPACE and that's it. Some heroes use D but that's usually on a long cool down so I hit it when I need it but don't hover it. Then I ONLY use right click. I thought I was going to hate this game because tutorial made me use a + click and I cant stand doing that.  Right click is simple, if you right click the ground you'll walk there, if you right click an enemy you'll attack them.  Do you play with the camera unlocked? If you play with camera locked IMMEDIATELY start playing with it unlocked. It is an absolute must in these games. You'll get the hang of it after a few games.  With the camera unlocked I'll usually move my view to where the battle is and click my character there. I make HEAVY use of space, anytime I'm moving I am toggling between space and moving the camera where I am going. In a fight I use space a lot, it centers the screen on your character so say I want to attack someone I will right click on them and then be toggling on and off space to see my screen moving with my character to make sure I'm headed where I want, that way you don't have to worry about finding your character in the melee but rather you simply know where your character is because as soon as you hit space he is in the center of your screen.  Also, this game unlike other MOBAs relies less on AAs for most heroes so you don't have to worry so much about hitting your AAs but rather being in the right position to use your skills. I find the skills are even more spammy in HotS than in LoL which is considered more spammy than DotA, and I love that it's spammy because skills are fun to use! So in a big melee it is more about being in the right position to either deliver skills or avoid dying, and it is a balancing act. If you are a melee guy run in, drop some skills, cc and damage, take some aggro, run out of the fight while your team bombards the guys now chasing you then when they are off your tail and your cooldowns are off you go back in with your skills."
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,eaglessoar,2,Tue Jun 30 12:59:02 2015 UTC,Wait say what now?  There's no need for me to A + left click to attack?
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,TheTank123,2,Tue Jun 30 15:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yea you can just right click someone to attack. So so so much better. I don't know why the tutorial teaches you a + left click, its so clunky and almost made me quit out of the tutorial.  I only touch left click for taking talents or moving my screen on the minimap, you can right click on the minimap to move there right on the map too, so just right click to a lane or a vision shrine or a merc camp and off you go! Right click to use fountain, right click to attack, right click to move, right click to turn in gold/tribute/gems.  I'd love to do a mouse tracking or something, I must be right clicking multiple times per second throughout the entire game (except when dead). I am just constantly following the hero I want to attack with my mouse and right clicking them, if I miss the hero and click the ground then at least I am sending to move in that direction. Even just moving somewhere it's like a tic I'm just always mashing it."
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,eaglessoar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"So from what you're saying, I think it is that if you A + Left Click on a spot your character will attack anything on the path from point A to point B, whereas right click will just move you from point A to point B, unless you decided to use the right click on a specific character/minion, in which case your character will attempt to attack that specific character."
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,TheTank123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly, should make your life much easier and the game more enjoyable!"
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,eaglessoar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"no. A + clicking is going to tell your character to move to that point while attacking. Right clicking a target will attack that target. Using the ""A"" key is good for kiting, stutter stepping and laning.    Figure out your character's max range and try to stay that far. Keep your melee frontline characters in between you and the enemies.    Right click to move, right click to attack. You can also queue movement commands with shift+right click.    As for team fights, remember your health bar is yellow. You'll get better at picking out enemy heroes, knowing who is who and which one to target, just by playing more. Things do get chaotic in team fights, if you get overwhelmed - just remember to keep attacking something, even if it's the wrong target."
NexusNewbies,3bl5u4,fanboyhunter,2,Wed Jul 1 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"It just takes a ton of practice and experience. It's something you'll get down eventually, but to speed up the process, I recommend playing the same hero several games in a row that you get accustomed to it and skills, movement patterns, etc., become second nature. Also, you might find it helpful to hold space so that you can focus on your hero."

NexusNewbies,3blzzt,Captaincastle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:37:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I sound harsh, but that is no tutorial. It's just 5 guys playing together while being on teamspeak - with a dedicated shots-caller. So the only advice I can get from this video is a) get 4 friends to team up with and b) get them on team speak.  Also some of the plays made me cringe - and I don't consider myself a good player by any means... Using Sylvanas' escape for damage when extended and without support. Going 1vs1 with completely arbitrary outcomes. Staying in lane and near fog with 1/3 health for a considerable amount of time. Letting coins lie around for the opponent to collect uncontested. And those are just the things I remember. A better opponent team would've slaughtered them...  Disclaimer: I'm German and understood their talking - to a degree since it was a terrible mix between German and Gamer-Semi-English. The last part my just be my preference, though. :)"
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,orangeway69,5,Mon Jun 29 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"I would read some guides, maybe watch some pro streams to get a better feel for the game tbh. If you haven't read Welcome To The Nexus I highly recommend it."
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,Ruhnie,2,Mon Jun 29 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"If you are leveling heroes to level 5, I would suggest going against AI first to unlock talents and get a better feel of each of the heroes before attempting to QM.

NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,Elloba,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:20:44 2015 UTC,"That probably means the problem lies in positioning and cooldown usage. Either you are out of position and getting ganked a lot, diving into a team fight when it's not appropriate, or something else along those lines and/or you're using your abilities at the wrong time leaving yourself to get picked off with no escape. I highly recommend checking out some streamers on twitch and watching how they go into fights, and get out of them. That's what has helped me a lot in my positioning."
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,Spe333,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"I've written quite a few posts about the basics for the game.  Priorities are very important. Learn the maps and how they work. More than anything else, if you have board control you win this game. Individual skill has little to do with winning if it's not based on teamwork.  Search for strategies on each map (you can go through my recent posts too) then apply them.  /join lfg  Try to find people to play with. Tell them you are new and looking for some advice.  Don't play vs AI, you will pick up bad habits. If you do, play full AI vs AI, the boys respond to your pings. Use this to learn the map and how to control them. Timing is everything.  Research your hero, get them all to 5 and then pick your favorite. Anub is awesome, he is my go-to hero."

If you're at least halfway serious about improving, you should put some time into reading up on the game. Mechanics. Strategies. For each character. Map strategies. Laning. Team fighting.   Lots of good resources on this sub! And sites like Icy Veins and others. Good luck and keep at it, just work on studying up! Sounds geeky but it helps :)"

NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,fanboyhunter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well, it can't hurt to know your heroes ;)   Anyway, if you are having a hard time in QM, I strongly suggest you play Against A.I. for a while, get used to the maps, the heroes and general mechanics.  Against A.I. is easier, and even with lots of mistakes on your team is very possible to win.   Another thing: you said you are usually 1st or 2nd on XP. That's not necessarily a good thing, it might mean you are spending too much time in the lanes when you should be helping your team, but I can't tell just by the given information."
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,kirolm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:00:42 2015 UTC,"Tbh I probably do spend a little bit too much time on lanes. So playing as Anub'arak, I should pretty much be always with the supports?"

After that your team should be grouping up as often as possible."

Eventually you will find heroes that ""click"" with your playstyle. Whenever you really miss playing a hero after its free week is over, buy it"

NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,fanboyhunter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that simple, but yes it will definitely help. I think learning your own heroes very well is important. You'll learn more about others as you play and can study them at your leisure.    Watching streams is also a good way to break down proper ways to engage, rotate on maps, etc."
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,RogueT3ch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"All things aside, it takes a lot of games to get good with a hero you're not immediately good at.  With Anub, I picked him up and instantly felt at home. With other heroes, like say, LiLi, the playstyle isn't natural and it's much tougher for me. But realize your ability to play the game from a macro standpoint doesn't mean you'll be able to pull off the same plays as you do with heroes you have a ton of games in. Sometimes, it takes those first 20-30 games with a hero before it finally clicks. If you are trying a lot of different heroes by leveling to 5, realize that you are learning a lot about the game but not spending so much time on any one hero where you're going to be amazing unless you decide to concentrate on it.  Don't burn yourself out grinding gold, either. Play what feels good, grind when that feels fun."
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,Elloba,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:30:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I realize... it's just the fact I almost never win discourages me from playing...
NexusNewbies,3bjzfw,RogueT3ch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:20:08 2015 UTC,"If you are not sure why you lost a game, watch the replay. Check when you were losing towers/keeps and when people died and why. Learn from mistakes you or your team made. sometimes it's just that the team doesn't have the same idea, for example 4 want to retreat and 1 wants to engage. the person jumps in, there is a game changing choice here, you all gonna jump in and help (and risk the whole team dying) or are you gonna sacrifice him.   What I noticed is, that it's important to watch the other team, are they aggressive and pushy or defensive and waiting for an opening?   anyways I can't explain all that I learned with a few words, if you wanna try a match together some time add me: Hannemaster#2651"
NexusNewbies,3bjfsh,wellsdavidj,7,Mon Jun 29 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Still very important! It's a given that the more exp you have, the better. If you're three levels behind, and get slaughtered in team fights, then all you're doing is giving up exp your team could be getting, and giving the enemy team a bonus. If you're split up, you can soak more experience. Sure, they can come and steamroll one of you, say, bottom lane, but that's a big waste of their time if you have people farming elsewhere. If you can close the level gap, then literally the only advantage they have over you is the forts they took before you caught up. Some heroes and teams scale much better into late game too - they're weak early, but once they catch up, they're unstoppable."
NexusNewbies,3bjfsh,LittleRed5,0,Mon Jun 29 18:52:49 2015 UTC,I'll have to remember that next time. In this particular match our team wasn't that great and kept sprinkling into fights instead of waiting. So the enemy team was just able to steamroll us from that point on.
NexusNewbies,3bjfsh,N8CCRG,3,Mon Jun 29 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's probably not just soaking, it's also clearing out some potential backlog of minions at that point. If you're behind and there are minions knocking on your gates, then you can push the line back to the middle, or even back to your opponents' gates. This can be crucial when a push happens on one side or the other."
NexusNewbies,3bjfsh,dreamslave,3,Tue Jun 30 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"When to soak:   Most of the time before ten (minus objectives). When you are down a few levels. When a big wave of minions and/or mercs is freepushing a lane (this is equally as much about getting xp as it is denying your enemies xp they're seeking). Similar to above, when a promoted minion wave is knocking down your door. The promote mechanic will change in the patch in a few hours, making promote punish people who ignore minion waves more as the resistant to damage and bonus minion damage of promote now only affects nonhero damage/targets.   Most of the situations above are not just about getting xp yourself but denying it to your enemies. I've had too many matches where I as a support have had to clear out a promoted wave or a merc wave because we're ahead and my allies don't see the danger or respond to my help pings. Even if there are no heroes to back them you really shouldn't let a big wave of minions freepush.  As for when you're down levels, stay close to your base and soak/clear the minions safely. Unless they're pushing directly into your core, soaking usually isn't a bad idea even if you lose a structure. It's better to catch up levels and go into a more even fight than to rush into a fight underleveled and get squashed as they freepush uncontested."
NexusNewbies,3bjfsh,bmh825,2,Tue Jun 30 05:05:08 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a better idea than team fight when you are behind. If they have a better team comp and have an advantage in talents, then you will just lose a team fight. Might as well split push and soak."
NexusNewbies,3bjfsh,m_takeshi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"Its not easy to give a definitive answer with only that bit of information, but I'd say in general, I think you should have forced a team fight before the enemy team gets 20.  If the enemy team reaches 20 (or would hit 20 before the team fight erupts), just split and soak until 20 but defensively.  I think soaking is important if you're behind in talents. If you're ahead however, you should try to leverage the talent advantage and work on objectives, mercs, team fights.   In your case, the enemy team should push his advantage by soaking until 20 and them going in as 5 (either objective or push)"
NexusNewbies,3bj40k,SquidQueenToken,13,Mon Jun 29 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"Buy nothing. Wait for a few more rotations and see who you like.  Also, play heroes in quick matches before deciding to buy them, you might think you like a hero only to find out that you don't when you actually play them against other people.  If you absolutely must buy something, wait for a rotation to end, play the new heroes, and if you keep thinking how much you're wishing you owned a hero from a previous rotation cause you wish to play them, then buy them. For instance, I'm mostly fine with the rotation champions a month in, but did get the ones that I felt, ""Damn, I want to play X."" But otherwise, the rotation is good enough to keep me busy until I do HL and need specific roles.  Check the sidebar for buyer's guide, the FAQ at top has a link or two to buyer guides that are more than hero descriptions."
NexusNewbies,3bj40k,tundranocaps,6,Mon Jun 29 17:35:11 2015 UTC,The best advice i've gotten and given is buy characters you enjoy playing. Worrying about tier lists is for later. It all really depends on what your goal for playing is. Is it just to have fun? get who you like. is it to rank up in Hero League? then remember you need at minimum 10 characters to even play which is 20k alone just going all 2k chars (this all depends on whether you want to spend real cash or not).
NexusNewbies,3bj40k,TheDarkHorse,3,Mon Jun 29 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"There aren't 10 2k characters, only 6. So right now, the bare minimum gold needed for Hero League is 26k."

NexusNewbies,3bj40k,mmi9tfp,3,Tue Jun 30 07:24:14 2015 UTC,"Keep playing and enjoy the free heroes.  You need 10 to get into HL, so if you plan to do that then buy cheap heroes.  Wait until you find a ""go-to"" hero. Or one that you really want to play (Diablo is a personal favorite lol, he's good but I just like hearing ""your soul is mine"" from him.)  Then look at popular heroes (like sylvanas) and try them out on free week. Find the play style you like and then find the ""popular"" hero for that style.  Use ""try"" mode. It lets you play any hero and see if you like it. This is also good to do to learn other heroes when you play against/with them. Make a glass of something strong then play all of the characters in Try mode, worked for me at least haha.  Hope this helps!"
NexusNewbies,3bj40k,Spe333,3,Mon Jun 29 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"I think chu8 said on his stream once - and now I agree - that you should wait until you have a fairly good amount of the 'good heroes' before getting too serious into hero league. I mean if your objective is to get a high rank (talking single digit here), you should own and be good at the higher tier heroes and since those can change every patch, I'd recommend saving your hard earned gold until you're really comfortable with the top heroes.  I say this because I was so eager to get into HL when I started that I bought all of the cheap heroes but end up playing only the 'good' ones right now (jaina, anub, johana, BW, TLV), most of which cost a lot (except anub) and I'm still at a pretty low rank (23-ish)  On the other hand, if you want to maximize the fun, save your hard earned gold until you find a hero that you must play every other game (TLV for me).

Humans play way differently than bots, so whatever you enjoy stomping the computer with might not translate the same way against people.  You earn more XP via QM too, so you can level your heroes faster.  I personally resolved to not buy anything until I've taken all the heroes up to level 5.  I've broken this rule once when I played Brightwing with my friends and found myself really enjoying supporting them.  So now I can always play her when that group is online.

I would buy LiLi, Valla, Zagara and another 2k hero you enjoy. (Zagara is 4k, right?). Raynor and Mauradin are on rotation this week, so maybe Malfurion or ETC?

He is a great way of learning from others because he fights through his teammates. He is hard to figure out at first but his global perspective is really useful for learning the game as a whole.  That being said, you should still buy those heroes that really click and make you think later after their rotation is over ""I really want to be able to do X ability that Y hero can do"".

After you get your profile to level 40, gold is really slow to come in and 10k is hard enough, let alone 15k, so definitely wait that two weeks to buy."
NexusNewbies,3bj40k,RogueT3ch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"Leoric first, and 3 weeks apart, not 2."

NexusNewbies,3bj40k,RogueT3ch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't worry about who is ""top tier"" so much.  This game is patched regularly, and heroes will fluctuate in power over its life.  Who is top tier now may not be top tier a month from now, etc.  Just find someone you enjoy playing as, and buy that person.  It's more important to have a character whose mechanics you like than it is to have a character the community as a whole thinks is good."
NexusNewbies,3bj40k,MutatedSpleen,0,Tue Jun 30 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"I cant tell you who to buy, I started playing 5 days ago! but I will say as some others have said, jump into QM asap. Play against other people. I've never played a bot game in LoL or HotS so far. I play the game to play other people. You learn your character better when playing other people. You might suck, you'll probably use your first game of any hero but whatever. Playing against bots is boring. If I want to play computers I'll go play Diablo 3  That said, I have bought two heroes because I got all the free people this week to 5, so I bought Sonya and Muradin.

NexusNewbies,3bkn09,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think not. People say you do, but it's anecdotal, someone ran numbers and it seems games in HL are on average slightly longer, but less likely to be super long than QM, so maybe that does it.  In general though, no."

NexusNewbies,3bkn09,tundranocaps,2,Tue Jun 30 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you like?  If you grab all 6 2k heroes, you can have four 7k heroes to hit 10 heroes, or two 10k heroes and two 4k heroes, to hit 10 heroes with exactly 40k.  A lot depends on what you're good with/comfortable with, but I'd try to get Muradin and Anub'Arak, Malfurion and either Reghar or Uther, to get you started. If you're solid with Illidan, get him too. Then it's much more about what you're good with at the 7-10k price range, but you usually want either Zagara or Sylvanas, or Nazeebo, to fill in the specialist role."
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,snowpuppii,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Is that the thing for everyone? load up on 2k heroes first? That gives you 2 heals, 2 assassins and 2 tanks right. Out of them i don't care for Raynor. so to fill in the rest; probably 1 more tank,support and  assassin and one specialist? I like BW but dunno know how he'll play after patch. Ditto for Illidan. Thats leaves extra tank and specialist. I don't really enjoy Anub'arak or sgt hammer too much. So guess something like jo jo + gazlowe or sylvannas + [is there another 4k tank?]"
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"That's for everyone. I don't like Li Li much, and E.T.C. is pretty rubbish too...  If I had to make this list for myself accounting for what I like/am not terrible with?   Assassin: Valla, Illidan, 10k hero (Jaina). Total: 16k.  Warrior: Anub'Arak, Muradin, Tyrael. Sonya is a ""warrior"" for 4k, but she doesn't actually tank... so she's a poor, poor fit for the role. Tyrael too is a bruiser and not a warrior, but he's actually good... Total: 13k. Cumulative total: 29k.  Specialist: Zagara. Gazlowe just can't compare to any of the others. Total: 7k, cumulative total: 36k.  Support: Li Li (cause you just have to), Malfurion, and we're at 40k, and one hero short. Which is why I'd recommend waiting a bit, or grabbing E.T.C. instead of Tyrael, since he does what you need to, and then with the extra 5k, and the 2k you specifically got from saving up on Valla, grab Uther/Reghar. The other option is to find another cheaper assassin (Tychus or Falstad?), and you're good to go.   If you're willing to spend some money, drop $15-20 online for the Starter Pack, it has Li Li, Zagara, Zeratul, Jaina, and Sonya.  That means you pick up the following extras, with 40k gold (I got the above, so this is more or less what I suggest, suggesting more universal heroes, accounting slightly less for taste):   Support: Malfurion, Uther/Reghar (Li Li), total gold: 9k.  Warrior: Muradin, Anub'Arak, Tyrael. Anub'Arak is just that good. 2 hard CCs, initiation, escape, high damage. Total gold: 13k, cumulative: 22k.  Specialist: (Zagara). Total Gold: 0, Cumulative: 22k.  Assassin: (Jaina, Zeratul), Valla. Total Gold: 2k, Cumulative: 24k.   You'll see I didn't mention Sonya above because you don't really rely on her. You have 16k gold left at this point, which I'd drop on Johanna if you don't like any of the above warriors, and if you drop Anub'Arak/Tyrael, you also are left with 8k/13k gold instead of just 6k to play with. You can then pick up Sylvanas, upgrade the 7k healer to Brightwing, or just pick up something you like, or a couple of 7k heroes, like Sgt. Hammer and the other 7k healer you didn't pick up.  I think spending $15-20 on a game I play this amount is worthwhile, especially with how many options it opens up."
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,snowpuppii,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:07:22 2015 UTC,I was looking at that. I think out of all the packs that has the most value. But i've been thinking about targeted spending. For example since BW is on sale for 5 bucks i can grab that and wait out another deal on a hero I like to be on sale. I know the waiting game can be lame but starter pack gives you like 30k gold worth of heroes? But out of that 1 or 2 is a luke warm choice.
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"Yah, and you can probably get keys for the rest on eBay, especially Zeratul/Jaina. If you can get all the ones you want on sales, it's definitely better. But well, it was useful :)"
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,cm512,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:39:27 2015 UTC,"I would play around with Kaelthas or Jaina and see which one  you like, and then pick one of those two.  Its a good idea to have a bursty mage type for HL and they are pretty high on the tiered list."
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,snowpuppii,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:11:15 2015 UTC,I enjoyed playing both actually. But don't Valla cover that niche?
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"Not really. Those two bring burst, she has to auto-attack and keep auto-attacking. Their AoE is also much better. Valla is more similar to Raynor/Illidan."
NexusNewbies,3bkn09,cm512,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:40:20 2015 UTC,I love Valla but she's more an auto attack hero than a bursty mage. Jaine and Kael can just wreck with their combos

NexusNewbies,3bj456,G9zoner,7,Mon Jun 29 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Illidan is balanced upon a single function, auto attacking.  His entire kit cannot be based around mana, due to 1 specific issue. His cooldowns and how they function.   His Q does terrible damage and is only used to dodge abilities and chase targets down.  His W does moderate damage, but is very short range and puts up a timed buff for his autos.  His E puts him on AA immunity for 2 seconds.   His R does medium-high damage, and puts additional hp cancels most targeted/skillshots and aoes.  If you remove his cooldown reduction on his trait, he doesn't function, as he does no damage and has no survivability. If you put him on a mana bar with that cooldown reduction, he has to base for mana every minute. That's not a good design.  He trades off ST and AoE damage for sticking potential."

NexusNewbies,3bj456,Spe333,3,Mon Jun 29 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"Icy Veins is great, I used to go there for World of Warcraft info and I'm glad they're covering Heroes as well.    Just like playing competitively in WoW PVP, one of the best ways to increase your effectiveness is to learn all you can about each hero. Knowing how that enemy Illidan plays will help you counter him better."
NexusNewbies,3bj456,rtnal90,0,Mon Jun 29 18:11:30 2015 UTC,He's a beast and I heard he is getting nerfed soon.  In the right hands and build he will tear a team apart late game. Pair him with Aba and they can kill a team singlehanded if Illidan is a good player (and the other team isn't lol)
NexusNewbies,3bj456,Spe333,3,Mon Jun 29 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think Illidan is that OP to be honest. If you land one good stun he's out. The problem is that you need to coordinate with your team to take him down, and that's easier said than done when playing with randoms and not having voice comm. If you play against Illidan, always make sure to have an escape-plan, no matter where you are on the map. Never engage him 1v1, instead try to rally up with your nearest teammate. In a teamfight, ignore him until either his evasion runs out, or until someone lands a stun/root/silence. After that you crack down on him with great vengeance and furious anger. If he escapes just let him run (depending on the situation ofc) don't break formation with your team. Illidan wants to catch you alone and isolated, don't let him play by his rules."
NexusNewbies,3bj456,Eriennyl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:05:58 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think he's OP most of the time, but with a healer and right skills he is a bitch to deal with.  People are scared of him and ignore him after he ults, so it causes problems. All it takes is a bit of focus and he usually goes down. I personally don't have an issue (Anub - ult, stun, stun usually takes him out quickly... But Anub is a bit OP atm as well imo)"
NexusNewbies,3bj456,hacdladf1,2,Mon Jun 29 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"This.  If u have a hero that stuns, save for his metamorphosis(unless he using to escape), he'll usually end up towards ur team trying hit as many as possible. Stun him right at the moment he re-appears.   Even when I play Valla with the shadow beasts ult, save it and use it on his metamorphosis, then vault back towards ur team."
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,JeepCrew,5,Mon Jun 29 14:22:04 2015 UTC,"I may not be the best Abathur out there, but I could give you some tips on how I play it with the melee specialist build (instead of pushing build).   The symbiote's strength is to immediately turn any 1v1 or 2v2 into a 1,5v1 or 2,5v2. It is not equivalent to a whole hero, but it has the element of surprise and is often underestimated. This helps a lot on dragon shire where there is a lot of 1v1. That explains why you should be changing the host all the time, and saving a jaina against a zeratul is possible if you are quick enough and watch your symbiote cooldown. The thing that really improves Abathur's utility is his mines. The damage is negligible, but the 4 seconds visibility of an ennemy hero is key. I always position in the mid lane because I then have the largest range for the mines and I try to put one in each bushes between 2 symbiotes. Do not underestimate how many ganks you can avoid with that (looking at you, zeratul). However, before level 10, you can place yourself close enough to a lane to soak exp, but be very careful to your own body. I tend to forget that, by always looking elsewhere. If there is a zeratul/nova on your opponent's team, they will always be in the bushes, meaning that maybe there is no safe place to soak. Your 2 attacking symbiote abilities allow you to reveal stealthed heroes, but they are quite useless if the ennemy is behind minions, or beetles... You can teleport with mine+deep tunnel to a map objective like a curse or a dragon Shire lane, but then you have no escape. Use with much caution, when fully aware of ennemy positioning. A monstrosity with 30 stacks is able to take down most heroes 1v1, when symbioted, if it has at least 2/3 of its life. You have to avoid getting hit by structures/minions, but this thing moves faster than a minion, meaning you have to make it go back by 1 wave when necessary. 2 additional things: your monstrosity can be healed by support heroes, it is not ridiculous at all to keep it alive, and heroes have little clue how powerful your creature is. 5 stacks ? 30 stacks ? They WILL engage then go back when realizing. Keep your 40% slowdown for that delicious moment. Your double symbiote at level 20 brings your presence as a hero to 100% on a teamfight. I recommend to cast your symbiote on the monstrosity so that you can stay close to the 2nd symbiote manually. Be ready to lose some Tomb of the Spider maps. And of course, know which heroes benefit the most from your symbiote, have a team that knows that they can chase a bit more with abathur, etc."
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,vpix,2,Mon Jun 29 15:43:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply and tips :)
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,vpix,2,Mon Jun 29 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, I guess you already know some of this. In case you're worried like I was about Abathur's utility: he was used in a pro match between Nova and Fnatic and the Abathur team won :)"
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,N8CCRG,3,Mon Jun 29 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"Don't sit in base or behind walls.  This is a dead giveaway of a bad abathur player.  Your body needs to be soaking XP all the time.  You need to be mining minion waves in another lane for more XP on kill or mining escape paths to kill enemies.  Your symbiote needs to be soaking the third lane.  You need good map awareness to make decisions on where to place your body and where to soak with your other methods.  If you aren't leading XP on your team by at least 1.5X (ideally 2X) then you are a bad abathur.  Fortunately, bad abathurs can improve.  If you are playing aggressively (and you really should be), I prefer a build similar to THIS.  Which allows you you help tremendously in teamfights and allows you to be super aggressive with siege starting at lvl13."
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,vpix,2,Mon Jun 29 16:46:06 2015 UTC,Wow. I'd seen so many Abathurs do this this that I assumed they got xp from their locusts. Now I'm retroactively mad at so much lost xp :(
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,xx17xx,3,Mon Jun 29 17:42:57 2015 UTC,"You only get XP from Locusts if they make the kill.  Same as any other skill.  To summarize:  Passive Soak:  1) Aba's body 2) Symbiote  ""On Kill"" Soak:  1) Locusts 2) Toxic Nests"
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,Viridar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips.  I am currently a ""bad Abathur player"" and am trying to improve that. First good player I saw with him was top hero, seige, healing, and xp.  Teammates complained about him being ""AFK"" but I knew better than that at least.  Since playing a few games with him, I definitely haven't been top in anything but have been soaking minion waves, so at least there's that lol.  Thanks for the link to the build as well too. Think my biggest weakness is tunnel vision and not paying as much attention to the map as I need to and pay too much attention to hatting a player and helping them too long.  Thanks again!  edit: Could you give some examples or a link to a guide that talks about playing more aggressively? Hard to wrap my head around aggressive play (especially body position-wise) with a hero that you don't control all the time. Thanks again."
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,emberchicken,4,Mon Jun 29 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with the aggressive positionning, but saying ""sitting behind walls means you're bad"" does not make that much sense. You can only deep tunnel every 30s, it takes time and can be interrupted. Meanwhile, locusts give you away pretty badly. It's not like bushes were the last place people go to mount/go back to core/wait for gank/check for incoming gank... I guess I play Aba differently than Goldmonkey007, but for now if you can soak xp when distractive objectives pop up, and still help the teamfight, I would say you're not a bad Abathur."
NexusNewbies,3bigp5,dreamslave,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"I went hyperbolic in that statement of sitting behind towers in order for it to stand out.  Sometimes you just can't leave the safety of towers -- Nova/Zeratul, heavy laning by other team, etc.  However, usually you can and usually you won't be able to passive soak from tower range so you have to get out into lane.  However, if I never see an aba move from tower range, they are most certainly an AFK Slug.  A term I heard Grubby use to describe abathurs who sit in base all game.  Also, because you are down a body the whole game.  Abathurs MUST make up the lost ground by providing the numerical advantage that levels provide.  If you aren't destroying the XP curve for your team, then you are probably dragging the team down with you.  There are exceptions to every rule, of course.  Having a roaming pair of Nova/Zera probably means you won't be able to soak as much, but on the flip side, 2 roaming heroes the whole game means that the enemy team is going to have lower XP gain as well."

You just have to work on paying more attention.  4) Not, not at this time.  5) Like a number? no, you can see their health bar when you see them on the map, but no way to see it if you can't see them.  6) Your in-game profile has things like most takedowns with X hero, etc., but that includes all of the games you've every played including vs AIs.

They are just being dicks and don't tell me what to do better besides that I am useless :\ So I guess we are playing around rank 15?  Half of the game is onesides stomps rest is slow, close games.  5; I try to, I watched few games of msi yesterday and saw quite few zeratul picks (which usually used same build as me), and looked at hotslogs to see which champions are stronger/weaker."
NexusNewbies,3bitht,Spe333,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Well it sounds like you don't belong on this sub haha. On here it's usually telling people to work on priorities and learning the game objectives.  When do they say you're ""useless""? I played a game with a group and one guy didn't have any clue how to use the terror from the garden. I tried to say something about it and he got all pissy.   Priorities are the biggest part of the game. Unlike league, kills don't actually mean much, it's your level and what you do after those kills.  So if you get the terror in the garden (I really don't know the right name for it) early game, rain the lanes and drop the plant to disable the turrets. Then push with your team/wave. I see people rush in and waste the advantage by taking the turret head on and no team with them. The goal is to have your health go down about the same as the timer, so that it does about the same time the timer runs out... Or has low go when the timer runs out. This is the same thing for the dragon.  For the mines map, make sure to kill the middle group first then the others. When fighting the golem, if the other team comes to fight you, run away and harass them. Making them take most of the dmg and cause chaos. The goal is to have over 30 skulls at least, but as close to 50 as possible. Trying to make it an even fight. Then get the camp on your side of the map.   At least these are the strats that work for me and that I have been told to use.  Also, pushing waves help. The turrets have a limited number of bullets. So pushing early game can help down towers late game. Just be aware of the map of course. The goal of kills is to get people out of the lane so they miss out on xp and then force a team fight at lvl 10 when they are lvl 8. And then again if you are 20 and they aren't. If you are behind on levels, focus on staying alive and in lane.  The biggest difference is that this game is about teamwork and working together. If you play with a team/people that don't work well together then it won't be good. I have a close friend that I can't play with because we don't play well together. He is very ""this is what you're supposed to do"" and I believe in the 70% rule, and don't get mad over decisions made in chaotic fights.  I only just hit HL yesterday and played 2 matches, but the people are much more organized than QM, I Iove it.  Maybe try playing solo more? You'll learn a lot of you ask questions and be friendly to people.  Just try to think team strategy over ""ooo I gotta kill him!""  I tried to just throw a lot of info out there to see if any of it is helpful. Not saying you don't already know stuff, just that I don't know what you know already haha."

So playing with them will not make you any better.  I grouped with a newbie once, explained things during the game and we won because of the map and priorities/patterns I taught them. Player skill wise, the other team was better. But when I died, my team knew what to do that we wouldn't get our shit pushed in.  Camp timing is important. Knowing when they will disappear, when to get them vs push without, and when the other team will get there's.   Watching the times on resurrections is also a big deal.  Looking at your recap. Your team comp is weird... And might be good if there is synergy, but i don't see it. The other team has a solid team though. Very ""go-to"" looking.  It looks like murky focused on lane pushing and wasn't there for team fights, where they were all there or at least grouped up for team fights.  The XP contribution of the other guys is lower than yours... And that's odd to me, because you should be roaming and killing. Not soaking lanes. But idk, I'm not that good at the game yet haha. A lot of things could have caused that to happen, over my head honestly.  PM me your user name of you want and I'll duo Q with you if you want.

NexusNewbies,3bitht,HaiKarate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:22:30 2015 UTC,"Looking at that screenshot, I wouldn't say you were a major fuck-up. Bad players usually have low XP contribution and lots of deaths. It looks to me like you did pretty good, overall.  People complain about Zeratul and Nova because they generally don't have a lot of XP contribution; they are focused on sneaking around and killing heroes. But like I said, your numbers look fine.  If anything, I'd say that your healer died a few too many times, and didn't pump out enough heals, compared to the competition.  Also, Jaina has a high number of deaths, and fairly low XP contribution (because of being dead all the time, no doubt).  All those numbers are soft because you're sharing XP, damage, and kills with any teammates in the vicinity. But deaths are strictly your own. You had high participation and only 1 death; you did great.  Whether you followed map objectives is another story, and one we can't get from the stats. But most likely, your teammates were being dicks and blaming you."

So...I guess yeah, don't attack me. ᕦ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᕤ"
NexusNewbies,3bho94,m_takeshi,3,Tue Jun 30 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to counter Johanna and they are both opposites. You have to commit to whatever choice you make as a team or things will go poorly for your teamfights.  The first and most popular is to ignore her. Push through her cc and in your faceness and go straight for her teammates. Her damage is abysmal, she makes up for it in health and kit antics so she now has to use her abiltiies to pull her off her buddies. Most people find this route the most successful, but I dislike it overall compared to the second option for a few reasons, but if it works for you that's cool.  The second is smart bursting. Johanna's strength usually lies in numbers because alone or focused, she cannot stand the pressure. Few people know this, but if you destroy her shield, she loses her unstoppable. I can burst it down extremely fast when I play as Jaina, and if another assassin focuses her down with me even her huge health pool falls fast. Either by burst damage or waiting it out, once her unstoppable goes down, bring out the cc train. Alternate your stuns and silences and she's done for.  I personally prefer the latter strategy because right now a lot of Johanna's power is in people fearing her or putting her up on this unkillable pedestal. She's far from it and as long as these rumors persist people will do the silliest things just to avoid her, which will lead to things being in her favor and her team's. At the same time, if your team is intent on the ""ignore Johanna"" train, trying to burst her down alone will just lead to your team suffering. If you see Johanna pop up on the enemy side, ask your team what their strategy is so you're on the same page before the teamfight even breaks out.  I hope this answer helped you out. :)"

NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,TheMoeBlob,5,Sun Jun 28 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"I've recently come to the conclusion that blaming stealth heroes for our deaths because we can't see them is kind of a cop out and blinds us to the real cause: being way out of position. Yea, they can stealth and can spring a gank anytime.. but that's mostly because the target thought they were safe. More and more I have been acting like I'm always fighting near tall grass when there is a stealth character on the other team. You just have to always be wary of being alone.   That all said, triple tap is extremely strong and the best thing you can do is swarm the fuck out of nova late game when she pops up. She can't triple tap if she's dead"
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,nightshiftb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:11:25 2015 UTC,I agree with everything in your post except for the triple tap part. It's actually really terrible. It can be bodyblocked by other heroes or buildings to save the target. She can be stunned or interrupted out of it (preferrably after one of the three shots has gone off so it's on the full cd not the 10 second one!) and her ult is completely ruined and she's dead. Precision Strike is the superior ult due to it's lack of a straight counter and higher utility in teamfights or objectives and it's global presence. A triple tap Nova's far easier to shut down.  Also for patch notes the new daze effect will still interrupt triple tap since it's a stationary channel and not a mobile one.
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,dreamslave,4,Mon Jun 29 04:12:57 2015 UTC,"I have plenty of tips to help you out against these two. I picked up on shimmer spotting relatively quickly (artist perks I suppose) but that's not the only way to stop them, though it is the easiest.   During the lane phase, as long as you're not laning against Sylvanas, hug your minions. They're going to block skillshots for you. Nova is completely shut down if her snipe hits a minion. Zeratul's cleave may hit you but his Singularity Spike has a similar chance of missing. Either way, they're caught out in the open. If you can spot the shimmer, save abilities for the right time. On Valla, save your multishot. On Jaina, any ability of hers will knock Nova or Zeratul out of stealth (even Frostbolt if you can land it). If you get the jump on these two, the tables have completly turn. Zeratul may blink away, Nova may drop a decoy and run, but both have an equal chance of being bursted down by you. Lane buddy with a stealth spotter. It's hard to know/ask people if they can spot the shimmer, but if you're really that worried it may be worth asking. Teamwork wins this game, and it could make your laning phase easier. Without asking, however, there are several heroes that innately reveal the stealthed heroes. Tassadar is the king of reveals. His trait, Oracle, reveals all enemies, stealthed or not, in a radius. It can be specced to be proccable as soon as every 15 seconds. Tomorrow's patch will give Brightwing the trait called Peekaboo, which will reveal any hidden or stealthed enemies wherever she phase shifts. Tyrande can land her owls on Nova or Zeratul and reveal them and her kit can also rip them to shreds between Hunter's Mark and her stun. Rehgar can get Farsight that reveals an area completely every 45 seconds, and Kael'thas, Murky, Nazeebo, and Uther can get Clairvoyance which is more or less the same trait with a different name. The most likely heroes to take that talent choice are Rehgar and Uther though. Play safer. Both stealthed heroes punish being out of position, taking high risks, and overextending. Most of the time, you have an equal chance of dying from a nonstealthed hero in the situation you died in. Eventually you learn the balanced of risk and reward, but starting against stealties, try to avoid wandering alone unless you see them somewhere else on the minimap. Play as if they could be right beside you unless you know they aren't. Don't fear them, but anticipate them. Try to see if they fall into patterns and see what you can do about working around those patterns. This may be unpopular advice, but if they catch you and it's an even match (1v1) do not run unless you can just vault behind your gate or something. Running away from them after their initial burst is almost guaranteed a free kill for them. There was a recent game where I was playing Falstad. The enemy Nova was gunning for me. She popped out first thing, hit her combo, but instead of running I traded with her. She went down hard. Whether I angered her or not I don't know, but she kept coming back after me. She killed me a few times but died nearly ten, either by me or my ally who was onto her and ready to kill her when she popped up after me. Either way, her kill farming turned into ours. Jaina and Valla can also outtrade stealthies if you know your character and you're ready to fight. Yes, there are times to run, but if you know it's you or them or your allies are running to your aide, you can either kill them with a sliver of health left or even out the kill trade by making sure they die as well. Understand that you will probably be a target for Nova or Zeratul whether you can shut them down or not. Jaina and Valla are two of their top targets. Even knowing I could spot them, they still tried to kill me pretty relentlessly whenever I play Valla, Jaina, Falstad, Kael'thas or any other squishy hero. If your team comp is rock solid and tanky, the Nova or Zeratul has to more or less hope you screw up to get their kills or hope your tanky heroes get low on health and aren't used to being in a stealthy's crosshairs (usually the case, most tanks are used to taking their full burst at full health and walking away like nothing happened so they don't look for the shimmer or watch out as much).   I hope these tips helped you. It's more or less the advice I've given a few people and what has worked for me."
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,dreamslave,2,Mon Jun 29 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"Great advice! I'd add a few more things:   Keep moving, and not in long, straight lines - Nova's Snipe requires precision, and it can be hard to land if you're constantly moving in unpredictable ways. It's also easier to avoid Nova's nuke if you're already moving. If your health is low, don't hearthstone in neutral territory; take the time to run behind your own barriers (far enough in that you can't be targeted) Always try to run into the grass to mount up; if you can't be seen, you can't be targeted, and by the time the enemy runs into the grass to shoot you, you may be mounted up and on your way. Worst case is that they unload on you in the grass -- but they will be right next to you, so you can unload on them in return. Save your best attacks while laning if you know you're being stalked. Most heroes have a simple melee or ranged attack that they use when targeting a nearby minion. Save your Q W E R attacks for when Nova or Zera pops and unload on them! Watch the mini-map to see if they pop up somewhere else on the map; if you see them actively fighting elsewhere, you know you can let your guard down just a tad."
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,HaiKarate,2,Mon Jun 29 15:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, these are wonderful tips as well! :D"
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,dreamslave,3,Mon Jun 29 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"Well first off there are no invisible heroes yet, only cloaked. Second, Jaina and Valla are probably the most well equipped heroes to deal with them as they have a lot of untargeted aoe. When you see their shimmer just toss a cone their way to reveal them and then vault away or combo your skills to kill them before they kill you.   Zeratul DOES have the shimmer, he just has a blink that he can use to jump from walls and bushes. He's also melee so Zeratul players likely stand still in wait for someone rather than move around trying to get a shot like Nova's do which makes him harder to see. Nova's typically run around mounted which is easier to see and Zeratuls typically do not which makes it harder to see. Its absolutely there though."
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,Psysaturn,2,Mon Jun 29 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, they both have the shimmer. I learned to cope through continuously trying my best to be aware of my surroundings. Check the minimap and look for the shimmer on your screen. You also have to watch for your positioning and mid/late game you must stick to teammates. I am a level 10 Zeratul, I feast upon those lost lambs ripe for the slaughter... :)  They have low health/no sustain, so if you can escape their burst and have a teammate, they are dead meat. Zeratul has a blink and Nova has a clone to throw you off or escape, you can't avoid his blink unless you stun him, but you can learn to recognize nova's clones. You have to watch the movement with a calm and clear mind and view your minimap to look for her portrait.   Those are some quick tips."
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,Lanceloet,2,Sun Jun 28 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"I hate that even if you see the shimmer, some characters that dont have aoe effects can't do anything about it. You should be allowed to attack the air or something."
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,N8CCRG,2,Mon Jun 29 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"Well, you have the option with your position. Nova's Sniper Shot needs a clean shot, ie: nothing in the way of it. Same with her Triple Tap. Zeratul's Singularity Spike needs the same thing. So keep to another Hero or put yourself in the middle of the minions. Watch your position. Don't over-extend. If you see the shimmer, get some distance from it. Both Nova and Zeratul have a range on their skill shots. Know where they are. Watch the mini map. If you see Nova mid, and then she starts to run top before her icon disappears, you know she's on her way.   There are ways to avoid them. Or at least take the advantage from them. Both of them work off the element of surprise. If they can't do that, they are screwed."

In LoL with Shaco you could ping him before he splits and the ping would stay on the real one, or ignite him (bit of a waste but same idea).  Anyway to tell which Nova is real? I always run off in the wrong direction. Also, does she control the clones or do they run around randomly?"

NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,CBTao,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:03:16 2015 UTC,"Play one of them! It helps spot the shimmer and learn how they work.  Playing an assassin helps spot the shimmer and makes you more aware of the best locations and waiting spots. (Close enough in lane for xp, but out of random aoe dmg)  For all assassins, focus them. Letting them run away with 1/4 hp is not good. They can wait and pick off stupid mistakes. Granted don't chase if you know you won't catch them, just focus them when they pop up.  Zera does have a shimmer. He's just better at getting away than nova."
NexusNewbies,3bg4wk,Spe333,0,Mon Jun 29 13:33:38 2015 UTC,It's a good a idea to pick talents to counter the stealthy characters. I main Anub  and always pick Burning Range because   I build DPS and helps along with +dmg scarabs and locust swarm I can de-stealth characters by walking near them

When you start out, the matchmaker can't assume you're terrible - you have experience with other games, and you may just pick up the game faster than others. You're not starting out with a low MMR and scaling up - you're starting out with an unknown MMR and the matchmaker is trying to place you.  Given that HotS is a team game and many factors aside from your own performance can influence a game, it takes awhile (I've heard the number 80-90 games quoted) for the matchmaker to truly put you where you belong."

Rather, try to be a pain in the ass to the other team. Body blocks and shields give you great escape ability and engage ability. Judgement launches you into one of the best team fight starters in the game. You don't deal the damage so much as facilitate the vallas and jainas and novas. Good luck!"
NexusNewbies,3bgjy9,nightshiftb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:57:10 2015 UTC,Thank you for your response!
NexusNewbies,3bgjy9,Roslyne,2,Mon Jun 29 02:05:40 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, Tyrael is one of the most mobile warriors in the game. El'druin's Might allows you to weave in and out of fights and generally be a nuisance to the enemy team. Typically you'll want to use judgement on a squishy and have your team focus spells on them, just be sure to call it out first either via pinging or chat/voice. After which you can move straight on to the other squishy targets on their team and either outright kill them or push them far out of the fight. Oftentimes focusing damage out on an assassin will force their support to peel you off them, essentially taking 2 heroes out of the fight, while at the same time your team wipes up the rest of their team without a support and damage dealer. Tyrael is one of the stickiest heroes in the game and near impossible to peel, abuse that.  Tyrael has the best attack speed of all the warriors so abuse bodyblocking and get off as many autos as you can, its where a large amount of your damage comes from. Additionally, with Battle Momentum, this sends your Smite/Eldruin's Might/Righteousness off cooldown faster, letting you deal more damage and be tankier.  Finally, remember to be flexible. Illidan metamorphs into your team? Drop your ult and make him embrace judgement. Team has no assassins? Go for auto attack Tyrael build. Adapt to your situation and make changes appropriately, sometimes you might not want initiate with judgement, sometimes you do. Read the situation accordingly."
NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,PigsDigTwigs,4,Sun Jun 28 18:28:44 2015 UTC,"Team up, counter push, send one or two people to grab objective, keep pushing.  You will win with map objective in a base race every time."
NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,kirolm,3,Sun Jun 28 18:48:06 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just having bad luck with uncooperative team mates. Every match the other team pushed hard it just ended up a defeat rather quickly
NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,mrrreow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, games where everybody does their own thing really suck. If you encounter someone on your team who communicates and responds, try inviting them to party up for the next game. It sort of snowballs once you get a few such people on your friend list. Get a group together, chat a little in hero select, and the team tends to be much more cohesive once the game starts. Much less flaming too, and even a loss can be fun."
NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,FCDRandy,3,Sun Jun 28 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had an issue last night with a Thrall who wouldn't come assist on a Tribute while we got wiped 4v5, because he said ""if you tell me not to lane before 10 I'll just ignore you.""  It's just uncooperative teammates mostly, the best way to counter is to ask for help on map objectives and push the other lanes, and hopefully they'll help you out."
NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,cthomlan,7,Sun Jun 28 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. They took the ""lane until 10"" axiom as an absolute: lane until 10, no exceptions.  That Thrall was obviously a Sith."

NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,Spe333,2,Sun Jun 28 22:12:51 2015 UTC,From what I've seen so far 5 people doing anything as a team is going to beat 5 individuals regardless of strategy.   Maybe there are some push builds which make it much easier to push core but backdooring core is nearly impossible if they are contesting as 5.
NexusNewbies,3bfa3o,PhloofyTron,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"If they push mid then push the sides in. Have someone with sustainability try to help mid hold out and soak xp.  If they All push mid then they are losing out on lane xp early game. Under lvl 10, lane xp is priority. Combine that with camps and you should out level them quickly.  The person holding mid should ping when they back off, giving you time to back off and hopefully hold the line/soak at the gate.  Then you have he bubble strat. If they are a team and push in to the gate, try to come in on the sides, split them up and bloody block on the turrets. Make sure to kill minions near turrets as well so they focus heroes. If they have assassins, focus them first."
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,vpix,2,Sun Jun 28 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"10 is a really important level for soaking. It is not the only level. Early Lv. 4 with your other teammates roaming can help you lock down the early game. Early Lv. 7 means having a lot of map control to let your team grab mercs or secure/get a lead on map objective. Whether that's coins, seeds, skulls, temples, tributes, whatever. Lv. 13 is usually a turning point as that will usually quickly lead to your Lv 16 talents if you win a team fight (and there should be a big 5v5 or two at some point of the game) and you have a lot of pressure with 8 bodies for blocking and damage and targets, etc. Knowing how to manipulate TLV within a battle is really important, almost as important as being able to have that map awareness. Longboat doesn't always have to be an offensive clean-up. It can help you cut off a big battle before it starts and give your team breathing room to back or re-group or re-engage.  I don't bring up Dragon Shire because it's really easy to know exactly what to do with TLV there. They are made for this map. It's not something you brought up because I imagine that comp would have no problem on that map. But that's the thing. One comp doesn't work for all maps. TLV isn't as good in Haunted Mines or B's Bay because they're smaller maps. Cursed Hollow and Garden of Terror have a lot more roaming than Spider or Dragon Shire. A roam can take out TLV easy, force him to play his soak lanes a lot safer, and any coordination on the enemy team means getting kills on individual vikings if they attack at the same time.   As for damage, you want to get that spin with all three members to melt shields and do a lot of damage in the scuffle, then get out."
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,kirolm,2,Sun Jun 28 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I agree about the early levels, but isn't it more important to win teamfights after 10 rather than soaking lane xp ? At that point the lane splitting may harm my team I think.  About the maps, I would definitely say that Spider has more roaming than Cursed Hollow or Garden of Terror. The lanes are closer and the smokes favor ambushes. I did not bring up Dragon Shire because I still haven't played on it with TLV, but I still wanted to ask why these 5 first games were a stomp. Were we very unlikely to win before the games had even started, or did I play TLV wrong ?"
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,kirolm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"It is, but you aren't team fighting 100% of the time. If your team is rotating together, you have time to split a viking or two to get vision, or using 2 of them to get easy mercs, or scout bottom shrine or turn in or something. Being able to move 3 characters on screen gives you a lot of flexibility from having to stick with the death ball post-10.  As for your team comps, it looks like you were seriously lacking damage, concentrating on one high damage dealer who might not have been able to pull the weight, particularly against some of the sustain you were going up against. That TLV being a Jaina or a Kerrigan might've turned things around."
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,kirolm,2,Sun Jun 28 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, so at which level are 2 vikings able to make a camp ? Also I avoid taking coins with them, as they are squishy, am I wrong ?"
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,OrganzdChaos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure at what levels it becomes viable, and usually, you want to take camps as a group. But like, seed camps or skulls are good things to grab. Easy camp is something you should do if like, you just won a fight and you have people rotating to turn in or something. And it depends on which viking takes it, and how good you are at getting away. Also, if you deposit as a group, you can use your jump to grab coins maybe an enemy has just cracked open all at once and float away / run so they don't get all 5 coins out of it."
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,kirolm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:29:07 2015 UTC,"Let me quote you for each time and then ill do it piece by piece, because i am seriously confused by your logic. And im not even going to bother going into your first paragraph because it is just wrong... Level 10 for soaking? if you have a 10-9/8 lead then you group and push with LB ult, no question. Lets get back to your 2nd paragraph tho.   I don't bring up Dragon Shire because it's really easy to know exactly what to do with TLV there. They are made for this map.  TLV isn't as good in Haunted Mines or B's Bay because they're smaller maps. Cursed Hollow and Garden of Terror have a lot more roaming than Spider or Dragon Shire.   Ill start by saying that the lost vikings are extremely bad on DK. They thrive when the enemy team leaves lane, on DK the objectives are not only touching the lane but they are also not permanent like EVERY OTHER map! You have 1 mid, 2.33 top and 1.33 bot. They cant possibly lose all shrines to that, the advantage is much greater for them. I have never lost vs the LV on DK, it is actually always a stomp fest. And i have only won once with the LV on my team on DK and that was me... It was lost the entire game but the enemy team threw it, so we won. At low levels maybe you can win, but its so much more one-sided on the other maps anyway so that changes nothing.    Next you say they arent good on haunted mines or B's Bay because they are smaller maps... 1) Black hearts is not small, it is one of the larger maps in terms of height and width does not matter with the LV. black hearts is the 3rd best map for LV and its very close to terror and sky. Haunted mines is not bad bc of its size, rather that the objective is quick and will punish you for only being 4 in mines, AND there are only 2 lanes, that is the main problem that you should notice instantly, not map size......   Cursed hollow and Garden... 1) cursed again is not a problem bc of roaming, its bc u need 5 on trib most of the time unless your team knows what it is doing... Again i havent lost vs a LV on this map yet. The size is actually the good part about the maps, and if you can micro well enough to not die to ganks then you shouldnt be playing lv. Its like if you have 10 apm and you die all the time, you dont blame the map, you blame playing like shit.   Ill make a separate paragraph for this one... The garden is tied with the best map with sky for LV BY FAR! 95% win rate + on this map because its so broken, its hilarious how dumb it is, and i assure you ganking is not an issue. ill even post a game of LV along with on black hearts and show you how easy it is to win. 1:15 you get 4 to get seeds as fast as possible while you soak, and the only problem for LV are strong laners, but thats for every map so that doesnt change shit. You then Get teror asap with the 3rd LV and push, while your team finishes up mercing. You split push get an early lead and then after that you win!!! You dont team fight either, because thats how you lose. LV are not strong at team fighting, regardless of what others may say, LB is not good enough to carry a fight nor win one effectively.   Ive played the lv for over 150 games with a 70% win rate in HL with mostly SoloQ which is impressive, because some players get mad when i pick them and some rage quit, so that brings down the win rate. I win almost all the time with friends when we make a comp tho, its cause its strong as fuck. I also dont sit in bush ever in a game, i am always pushing and i am always rotating between vikings, thats how you play them correctly. And as for order of worst to best map - DK, Tomb, Mines, Curse, Black, Terror, Sky... It is that order no matter what.   https://www.hotslogs.com/Replays/ShareReplay?ReplayShareID=6424 https://www.hotslogs.com/Replays/ShareReplay?ReplayShareID=6426  And if you dont believe that i am one of the best LV players then you can watch these, i just picked them randomly so i dont know if i played my best or not, either way - MEH!   EDIT: ALSO double hit the number i am, so for sky temple im 10 so double tap 0 and it will follow me to see how fast i rotate and see what i do. Ill be adding more as they upload - Also in Sky i was typing quite a bit, so if i ever stand still it is most likely because of that, was talking to a friend in game with out coms :O"
NexusNewbies,3bfpti,OrganzdChaos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:14:33 2015 UTC,"Soak to 10, not past 10.   TLV are third in best heroes on Dragonshire with 1550 games this week alone and a 55.3% win rate. At Master tier, and because TLV are mechanically difficult to play properly, this jumps to 2nd best hero on Dragonshire with a 70% win rate over 80 games in the last 7 days. During skirmishes, they can grab shrines. To defend, they can bully one shrine against one hero trying to steal easily. They can harass, they can sustain until it's the right time to steal the shrine, or easily get back together for roaming or when team grabs DK. Dragon Shire is a great TLV map.  Black Hearts lack of width late game means in a late game battle either your team is pushed and your vikings are more vulnerable at T2 defenses or you're pushing and, although you shouldn't split push this late in the first place this late in the game, if you are you're still closer together than split pushing, say, Sky Temple.  Cursed Hollow has their win rate at 56%, but at 17th under a whole lot of other heroes at the Master tier. Meaning, people know how to deal with the Vikings here. They are second on overall, but the better your opponents, the less effective TLV becomes on this map because they are not difficult to counterplay here if your team is organized.  Similarly, in Tomb of the Spider Queen, they are 31st, with a 50% win rate, at the Master Tier. They are also 9th on the overall tier, with, again, a 50% win rate. There are always going to be outliers, but Master Tier in HotSLogS is a great way to see what happens when everyone playing knows their heroes and knows the game well, and TLV just fall hard on a couple of maps because they are not an ideal pick.  Your personal stats are not as useful as the stats of everyone on HotsLogs to determine how effective a particular hero is on a particular map, if you want to go that route, but their kit is just not fantastic for tiny maps with a lot of hard skirmishes."

NexusNewbies,3bg3b1,dreamslave,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Not just for cheese comps, but in matches where teamfights aren't going your way, avoid them. Push hard, merc grab, force them to split up to deal with them and take them out one by one. With your comp, you could have tried in teamfights to all focus down one target. If they die, they're down a man. If they live, their team just spent almost all their healing potential for a few secs to negate your burst, now they're vulnerable. Anub'arak could have used his stuns to lock down their team as you hit them as hard as you could.   It could also help to predict what roles each support would take. Tyrande probably built like an assassin. Uther was probably their tank/warrior. Brightwing probably built for damage/cc. Malfurion probably went straight healer and Lili possibly too (not sure this is just my assumption knowing supports well). Knowing that, treat them like an average team that just happens to have self heals (I was in a similar cheese comp situation with x5 warriors that had self heals and in hindsight this is one of the things I realized I did wrong).   Over time, if you qm, you'll get used to odd team compositions for fighting them and being a part of them. I'm still learning myself, but it can be really interesting and fun to try quirky teams."

NexusNewbies,3be8p9,CynicCorvus,3,Sun Jun 28 12:14:53 2015 UTC,Great write-up and I really can take cool new things to do from it! Exactly what I wrote this post for!
NexusNewbies,3be8p9,jus_plain_me,9,Sun Jun 28 13:07:00 2015 UTC,"Cynic pretty much nails the pre 10 section that many seem to not understand.   Imagine you're a run of the mill assassin in a lane without a healer. Nova comes out of nowhere bursts you down to 1/2 hp. You now go back to a well have sip and in a bit come back to nearish full HP. You step outside the gate and BAM! 1/2 HP again. Now what?...   Either you stay in lane and are now in prime range to get killed by the next Nova volley. You have to hearthstone back get to full HP and walk back to lane. Which pre 10 will waste the exact same amount of time had you died in the first place.    Obviously it's better if you get the kill, but don't be disheartened if you don't. Remember even if you don't get exp from the kill, their team is losing exp since one of theirs is no longer getting exp from lane if they retreat."
NexusNewbies,3be8p9,CynicCorvus,2,Sun Jun 28 15:54:36 2015 UTC,Not a problem glad it helps GLHF

NexusNewbies,3bfqk5,larascrafty,5,Sun Jun 28 20:45:18 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think of is you may have camera follow on (L key) or you are absent-mindedly hitting space when you respawn.

NexusNewbies,3bfqk5,MaritMonkey,2,Wed Jul 1 10:06:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't exactly figured out the trick either so I can't tell you the never-fail way to get it to work, but if you left click the area you want to go on the mini-map and then right click around in the play area as you're spawning, usually the camera sticks around there so you can go where ever you actually want to go.  I think the key is to left click on the mini-map within 10 seconds or whatever of your spawn timer ending."

NexusNewbies,3berxq,sStarz1779,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:13:24 2015 UTC,"QM also uses a matchmaking. We don't know, but common assumption is that it's the exact same algorithm than in Hero League, only it tracks a separate internal matchmaking rating - and ofc doesn't display any rank publicly.  In other words, for all you know you're ""rank 1"" in Quick Match. ;)"
NexusNewbies,3berxq,Carighan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there really isn't a true mmr matchmaking yet. HL is mostly just a draft mode version of QM that gives you a ""ranked"" sticker. You could be rank 50 and matched with rank 14s (that was my first experience with HL). Blizzard seems to have some kinks to work out of their elo matching system before they enable it at all."
NexusNewbies,3berxq,Psysaturn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"I find it ""easier"" to play HL because my team mates are usually more cooperative and/or capable of working together. QM sometimes is a clusterfuck of madness that makes some matches waaaaaay harder than they should be."
NexusNewbies,3beupz,Stroopwafels112,2,Sun Jun 28 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"Three seconds of invincibility? Why wouldn't you want that?   It means you can blow your load, pop it, and then after you come back out mash your buttons again.   Or if you get caught and your team is nearby/on their way you can use it to wait for the counter initiate so it's not a 4v5,  But a 5v5 with them missing important cooldowns and some of their damage dealers out of position (since they moved forward to kill you)  Alternately you can use it to dodge a telegraphed ability. Kael's pyroblast slowly floating towards you? Iceblock just before it hits and it deals no damage but still goes on cooldown.   All and all it's a great talent for squishy dps/assassin's. It's like a zhonya from league of legends.  But it's not the best talent for zeebs since he has so much free health so he's not easy to kill in one rotation, and sprint is his only movement ability."
NexusNewbies,3beupz,averitasdeo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"Malf can do his ultimate heal and then ice block, effectively becoming a super healing ward and healing himself"
NexusNewbies,3beupz,nochroot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:49:01 2015 UTC,There are some instances where Iceblock has to be used to avoid a certain otherwise lethal attack.  The most common signs to go Iceblock is if you are playing against either of:   Kael'thas and he picked Pyroblast Nova and she picked Triple Tap.   Sprint wouldn't help you with these as they track you.
NexusNewbies,3beupz,Carighan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"You can disable ice block by pressing the button again.  It's nice in the middle of a team fight for hard ultimates or a sudden amount of burst / expected stun / etc. You don't have to just stand there. Use it, absorb the damage, then unpop it and move out.   It's tricky to use it right, and in zeebo, you are rarely in the deep of things. However, if you are in the middle of 4 enemy players, your team is running away and you have no way out. Save the ice block. The 3 second delay on killing you isn't worth losing the cooldown unless there is a very good reason for delaying the enemy 3 seconds (like your team grabbing boss nearby or just about to grab map objective or something of the sort)"

NexusNewbies,3bbu4b,shelbisayshi,3,Sat Jun 27 22:18:08 2015 UTC,Nice video! I appreciate the discussion of the general etiquette associated with each ping.  How do you get announcer chat to show up as subtitles where ping text appears?
NexusNewbies,3bbu4b,ponks,3,Sun Jun 28 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"If you have your sound muted (ctrl + s) then the announcer shows up as subtitles. Not sure if you can make it show up this way when sound isn't muted. I discovered this by accident, since I turned off the sound so I wouldn't have to talk over anything."
NexusNewbies,3bbu4b,ponks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:53:47 2015 UTC,Interesting. I like to mute stuff selectively in MOBAs so that I can hear audio feedback but still listen to podcasts and such. It would be nice to mute and sub the announcers on their own without muting the whole game.

He talks about how to get attacks in while body blocking. 5 seconds actually sounds like a pretty long time to block someone. In the clip, it looks like even one of the top HoTS players can only obstruct a running enemy for a little while."
NexusNewbies,3bde67,mrrreow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:12:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you so much! This was very helpful. Also, yeah I was wondering whether the person in lane with me wasn't dpsing them down fast enough or whether it was on my part that I needed to block them longer...So I guess I don't have to block them forever and if they get away sometimes it's ok?"
NexusNewbies,3bde67,kirolm,2,Mon Jun 29 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of it has to do with your positioning when you engage.   If you come in from an angle where you're running through mercs or creeps and they have more than one way out, you're asking to get kited down.  The truth is, sometimes, chasing those kills isn't worth it. Early game, if you can make them B, you are denying a lot of XP in solo lanes or allowing pressure on multi-hero lanes. You are also forcing their roamers to rotate to that lane, which takes pressure off your other lanes.   That said, it's all about prediction. If you have a skillshot that can hit them past the gate, save it for after they get past it instead of burning it for damage early on. It can get you a handful of kills you might not have otherwise if they manage to hit fountain.  Your role as a tank bodyblocking is two fold. It's not just about blocking their way out, but about making them more predictable for your assassins to DPS them down. You aren't trying to necessary lock them down, just delay them enough to where they start misclicking and your assassins have just enough time to take them down.  Visualizing what path you're going to force them to take (and making sure said path is the longest one without putting yourself in danger) before you start an engage can work wonders. Just be aware of the map so you don't end up flanked from behind."
NexusNewbies,3bdk2v,WhyNotBard,3,Sun Jun 28 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"It's usually 2 ranged damage dealers, 1 tank, 1 support and 5th could be pretty much anything"
NexusNewbies,3bdk2v,arcticf,2,Sun Jun 28 08:49:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on the map, the enemy hero composition, your teams talent build, your strengths, bans, etc.  There's no real meta. A support is nice, you need CC and damage too. Utility is always useful. Essentially, you want a balance of things that can mitigate damage/CC, things that can CC, things that can do siege damage, things that can do hero damage and some sort of synergy between your heroes. It just comes with time, but with 7 maps and growing, it's tough to have any one composition be the best in every situation."
NexusNewbies,3bdk2v,kirolm,2,Sun Jun 28 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on the team. Also it's not so much x type hero as what you're building for. The four general team types are:  Poke Comp-Most common type. Warrior tanks the damage as ranged heroes kill the enemy from afar. Poke comp heroes are usually Jaina, Kael'thas, Valla, Sylvanas, and other ranged heroes guarded by one of the popular tanks and healed up by one of the popular supports.  Dive Comps-The opposite of poke comps, these heroes jump into the enemy and try to take down the team quickly while their healer keeps them alive. Heroes that excel in this comp are heroes like Illidan, Tyrael, Kerrigan, etc.  Wombo Combos-This team focuses on ult stacking. AOE ults hitting one after the other and annihilating the enemy team in a heartbeat. It's very hard to pull off without voice or friendship coordination, but super rewarding. Heroes with Wombo ults include E.T.C., Zagara, Sylvanas, Zeratul, Gazlowe, Kael'thas, Johanna to name a few.  Siege comps-These teams push lanes hard and aggressively. They usually are centered around their specialists and they will push hard while protected by their tank and healer. Sylvanas, Zagara, Gazlowe, Azmodan, and other specialsts will be the bread and butter of this team. They can be tricky to deal with because unlike the other comps, they may even go as far as to ignore objectives to just free push, giving you a dilemma on whether to stop them or claim the objective first.   Over time you will be able to understand each comp style better and how to fit into it and counter it. I didn't list every hero that could go into each because some heroes (ie Sylvanas, Anub'arak, and others) could fit into any of them viably. Generally you want at least one Warrior and at least one healer Support and one high damage dealer (doesn't have to be Assassin, can be Specialist). Other than that it's really up to picks as kirolm mentioned."
NexusNewbies,3bd49b,Astalon_,2,Sun Jun 28 02:14:37 2015 UTC,I can go through your replays with you to see what the issues are.  Add me if you need some help :>  Fiamma#3917

NexusNewbies,3bd49b,harrydesmart,2,Sun Jun 28 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Either through hotslogs replay page, which updates every 20-60mins, or through skype, or a uploader like mega or dropbox."
NexusNewbies,3bd49b,harrydesmart,2,Sun Jun 28 18:21:20 2015 UTC,Added you and shared 3 replays on Hotslogs.  Brightwing Dragon Shire - 2306 Falstad Blackhearts Bay - 2806 Anub'Arak Blackhearts Bay - 2806  No rush and don't have to watch all 3 either.  I appreciate any help I can get.  Just thought it would be good to share 3 different hero class.  I usually prefer to play support though.
NexusNewbies,3bd49b,harrydesmart,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:12:29 2015 UTC,"I'll just copy paste my findings/issues.  Anub'Arak BHB  You are not activating W when you are going to take damage, your E's are very late, use it to dodge abilities, not just use it as an escape tool when you take too much damage. Pre-emptive usage of E will make you take significantly less aoe damage and cc.  Normally you want to do a 2 man top to push the wave out, so you can contest top chest with 4 people instead of just 3. Provides a 25-30% extra exp if you clear the wave fast.  You are very slow to rotate lanes to soak, even if you are doing a 1 man roam mid/top to soak, normally you just want to use all abilities to get as many cs as possible and just roam to a lane that has a stronger push towards your side, even if you lose 1-2 minions, moving to a lane that has more minions would net a larger exp advantage.  Know when to just play safe and soak, it's not needed to auto a wave to get exp faster if there's a high chance you are going to die to a roam. It's just better to mount up and just walk around exp range, playing it safe.  You keep fighting when you are significantly behind, or when a 5v1 pick is non-existent, also if you do get web it's better to web a target that is going to engage on you, as he would be either far behind from everyone else or get a target that follow ups.  Also it's good to note that what talents are better against what heroes, against a team comp like valla, raynor and illidan, it's better to get imposing presence so that they are permanently hit by the aspd debuff, significantly reducing their damage output. Blood for Blood whilst is generally good, the benefit doesn't outweigh the aspd debuff advantage in that scenario.  Brightwing - Dragon Shire  Try and force tap a well as BW before you contest early objectives, as the trade would favor you much more than them.  As BW, you don't auto trade as much early game as you should be doing, also try and trade mana and health much harder early game as you have the capacity to just reset it with your port.  Also whilst you are a support, you should be the one soloing most of the time as you can just port to a teamfight when necessary, whilst this is mostly not your fault necessarily, try and lead your team into a better lane setup.  If you do take bribe as BW, try not to spend 2 charges on stuff that are safe to take, if you are going for their sieges uncontested, it's better to just spend the charges, however, with someone clearing the camps with you, it's better to just spend a single charge or none at all.  xxx"
NexusNewbies,3bcrzj,kevbro22,6,Sun Jun 28 00:08:22 2015 UTC,Yeah just check the ai teammates box and it's just you and bots
NexusNewbies,3bcrzj,Captaincastle,3,Sun Jun 28 00:18:02 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Heroes of the Storm!  It's my first MOBA as well, because after getting flamed out of two matches in a row in HoN and consistently failing to act quickly enough in DotA 2 (last hits, shopping, etc.), I decided the genre wasn't for me.  HotS seems to be a better platform for learning the genre than either of those two games, and adds some exciting new features like multiple maps, team xp, and map objectives, just to name a few.  As Captaincastle said, you can simply choose Versus AI mode and check the AI Teammates box and away you go.  Playing solo with and against the AI is a great feature for learning the basics like how the various maps work, what the controls are like, and how the objectives play out.  That said, as soon as you're comfortable with those things, I'd highly recommend unchecking the AI teammates box so you can begin to see how the game works cooperatively.  Once you're comfortable with that, there really is no substitute for playing against other players.  It adds a level of enjoyment that the AI simply can't match.  There's really nothing like outwitting/outplaying an opponent, and there is something to be said for having the same happen to you as well!  I've used this subreddit extensively to help myself understand the game and it has also led me (via users' comments and the sidebar) to some other great sites that have really accelerated my understanding and gameplay ability.  Please don't hesitate to ask us questions, as that's really the whole point of this sub.

NexusNewbies,3bcrzj,angrmgmt00,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"Soloing against bots will form bad habits when you're ready to enter QM. The AI is foolish and over extend often where as real players don't. I would use vs AI to figure out play style and build but don't use it as a crutch or I promise you will regret it. HOtS is very forgiving compared to LoL or Dota as you all level at the same time and there is no items to get, just talents. If I've learned anything (just hit 30) it's that teams that communicate win. Learn pings and how to use them typing takes you out for too long you can ping for practically any reason and it works well. Plus you can't block pings people can turn off chat, which if you're getting harassed I would suggest doing that. Help your team don't just stand and ignore fights and you'll be okay."

NexusNewbies,3bc5ma,Kind_Of_Kind,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"Johanna is my main - and I can tell you she's worth it. She is the most fun you will ever have playing a tank. She's one of the tankiest tanks in the game. Has one of the longest stuns in the game. She's a really solid counter to stealthies (3 of her skills don't need to be targeted so they can reveal stealthies easily). She's amazing at peeling - a Johanna and Kael'Thas are almost unstoppable together in lane.  She's very rarely the wrong choice. No one's every been upset that I picked Johanna, as long as I play her well. I'm only rank 31 in HL,  since I just started, but my win-rate with her is sitting around 69%."

NexusNewbies,3bceiy,Oinkhammer,2,Sat Jun 27 21:59:56 2015 UTC,"There were some reports in the datamined patch about more bundles. No one but Blizzard can give you a guaranteed answer though.  Also, search the internet for the Starter Pack, roughly $15, much better value."

NexusNewbies,3bb9ss,lazywizardv2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"Your choice of traits will make an impact. I build something like this:  Conjurer's Pursuit -> Mending Serpent -> The Good Stuff -> Jug of 1000 Cups -> Hindering Winds -> Herbal Cleanse -> King Fu Hustle  Herbal Cleanse doesn't give you quite as much raw healing per second as Two for One would, but keeping your movespeed up makes it much harder to die (and anything that purges stuns is a good thing in my book). Kung Fu Hustle is absurd; get poked in a teamfight and you can instantly throw a brew. I wouldn't go for 1,000,000 Cups, since your healing rate with a hustled Q is just too good to give up.  How was your team doing compared to the enemy team? If yours was putting more pressure on in teamfights, then the enemy Li Li would be doing a lot more healing than you."
NexusNewbies,3bb9ss,etherealeminence,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Our team actually won the match, we were doing better the whole game I think."
NexusNewbies,3bb9ss,kirolm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"Where you in a lot of team fights?  Most of the time, those super high heal numbers means they were around 4 members of their team healing regularly with basically the same kit you might've been healing 2 members with."
NexusNewbies,3bb9ss,harrydesmart,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"Once you hit 20 with Lili, you get an extreme hps gain; with the Kung Fu Hustle ability.  Also to note that if your teammates are playing rather safe against a team comp that has no poke, your healing will probably be substantially lower than a game with strong poke like azmodan or kael'thas.  Numbers doesn't mean everything, but attempt to try to equalise it.  If your ult is regularly interrupted, try and wait for specific stuns to go on cd before using it, or position yourself very far away from removal abilities like maw or vp, so you can get your targets healed even if some of them are removed from the fight.   Whilst most of your heals do come from your Q spam, having a 75-100% full channel of your ult would provide significant HoT.   Also as lili you need to know when to stand near the mid range of a fight, the front line and the back line. Whilst her kit is relatively easy to play, she is the hardest in terms of knowing when to position, as she is extremely vulnerable to burst and initiates and removal. Whilst I would go in-depth about it, I would just say to play more games and get used to the game itself, it's better to play and learn rather than someone instructing until you hit a skill cap."
NexusNewbies,3bb9ss,levinho,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:44:15 2015 UTC,A tip here is that in team fights you should just hold q forever.  It's pressed automatically and auto targets so you'll get a lot more or of it.   Also holding the q doesn't interfere with your other skills
NexusNewbies,3bb9ss,tundranocaps,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"Mending Spirit + Lightning Spirit also work well together, and is a form of direct heals which Li Li lacks in general.  Also, did you die a lot more than that person?"

NexusNewbies,3bcxzf,angrmgmt00,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"Right, the first few games change quickly, and are considered placement matches.  After the initial period, you'll start to see that increase go down in size (hypothetically assuming you continue winning).  GL HF!"
NexusNewbies,3bcxzf,duo797,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"Like angrmgmt00 says below you the first few matches you play have a pretty important effect upon your MMR. When you start off, the matchmaking system has a high level of uncertainty about your skill level and so as you win or lose it makes very big changes to your MMR because it assumes 'oops this person is way better/worse than this'. As you play more and more games it becomes more and more certain of where you are as a player and so your MMR gains (and losses) will be much smaller. This is the way most MMR systems work."

NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,HarrekMistpaw,10,Fri Jun 26 15:44:22 2015 UTC,Killing your enemy is a bonus. Forcing them to not be in lane is the goal.
NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,TenspeedGames,5,Fri Jun 26 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"One of the things you'll also notice is those ganking squads usually dissipate right as the waves start exiting the gates.  Basically the mindset seems to be, ""If we can get a kill before waves start then great, otherwise, back to business."""
NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,Meto5000,3,Fri Jun 26 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"Not only this, but also, clearing waves really fast and moving on to do the same in the next lane.  Getting an early level 4 before your opponent can mean having a much easier time denying map objective.  It's an XP Rush to 10 for the first phase of the game."
NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,kirolm,5,Fri Jun 26 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"Yes! I think a big part of stepping up from ""newb"" level is learning self control, and mechanics like this are one reason why. Even if you were able to dive and secure an early kill, you may have to retreat or may even be picked off yourself."
NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,fanboyhunter,5,Fri Jun 26 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"A big thing with HotS seems to be board control more than K/D ratio and even levels.  That being said, the kill might be worth if they self heal at all. As the goal is to get them to recreate and miss out on xp... Without biting the dust yourself, and that's when self control comes into play haha."
NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,Spe333,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"At the lower skill levels, getting an early kill often intimidates the enemy team. Sometimes players will even leave the game. Bullying a team out of lane and objectives frequently wins games."

NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,mcandre,4,Fri Jun 26 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"To be pedantic, it's technically not a zero sum game - if you gained xp for each friendly minion that died without an enemy near enough to soak it, creeps would be a zero sum game (the amount gained minus the amount lost sums to zero). Similarly, xp from kills isn't zero sum - if a kill stole xp from the enemy team instead of just giving your team xp, that would be.  Your broader point and what you meant still stands though, and ties into what /u/HarrekMistpaw said."
NexusNewbies,3b7c2b,d20diceman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"You learn this when you first kill a hero :)  The XP advantage fromkilling an enemy hero is that they are not soaking those minion waves until they return. The more you can deny them lane presence, the better for your team."

NexusNewbies,3b8wen,TXKSSnapper,0,Sat Jun 27 03:41:49 2015 UTC,Yup. For example is useful on Gazlowe who has no instant skillshots to reveal stealthers. Just run to them and they are revealed.  The flipside as the other guy said is that you shouldn't pick it on Zeratul because it can damage an enemy and kick you out of stealth when you don't want to (and because it is by far the worst talent in that tier)
NexusNewbies,3b8wen,cheesesamishen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"Zeratul's Burning Rage stops when he stealths, doing no damage at all until he becomes visible again, therefore not kicking him out of stealth."

Otherwise in pubs you should move more as a unit, killing the enemy team as a group as they enter before you take the mines, which should be very easy if you really are ahead by a large enough margin .

NexusNewbies,3b8cyk,Dombervald,2,Fri Jun 26 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"Early game you kind of just don't contest things like that.   What your job is early game is to keep the attention of enemies while your team does those objectives.   If the enemy chases and ""kills"" you while your team takes a chest/mines/plants/other, then you effectively utilized murky. If the enemy roamer (if they have a roamer) chases you instead of ganking lanes, then you've effectively used murky's early game. You dying means absolutely nothing, especially when your team can utilize it.   Set up a security net for the enemy team of ""oh murky is useless to them lets leave him alone"" then come back later and one shot their damage carry. Getting through the early game is most of the battle for murky"

NexusNewbies,3b8cyk,Talashandy,2,Sat Jun 27 07:59:23 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that early game, Murky is used a lot for keeping the other team away from xp on minions. He's great at harassing. Plop your puffer in the middle of the minions then run in the middle and slime, then float away. You can effectively chase people cause nearly everyone will run when they see puffer down. If they don't, standing on it will keep them from targeting it to take it down.  Teamfights early game, you basically poke and pull people away. As long as your egg is relatively close-by, you can run back fairly quickly and start bothering them again. People will chase you, because you are an ""easy kill"" and people like that.  Murky's biggest strength is and will always be, be annoying as possible. ;)"
NexusNewbies,3b8cyk,Talashandy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"I probably deny XP to myself too though :(. You need ~3 Slimes, one Puffer to clear a wave.

If i decide to hover with bubble on minion wave i can do a second slime, but its not enough to clear the wave. So if i die at this point, im leaving super low health minons on lane, probably losing xp. Any advice? I feel like i die way to often lvl 1-3."
NexusNewbies,3b8t4n,TehPenguin_Lord,6,Fri Jun 26 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"You gotta reorient your general attitude, imo. No one wants to be stupid or make mistakes (excluding obvious trolls who usually tell you beforehand). I've not had a significant problem with people ignoring or not reading chat in over a year of gameplay now. Some people are too inexperienced to fully incorporate more mindful play as soon as you tell them to, but they're at least going to try if you make a polite observation. If teammates are playing too aggressively or not watching the minimap, you have some options.  You can ignore it. Some games just are not going to happen. Comebacks are fairly easy in this game, but there are times where, for whatever reason, people aren't meshing. At least one person is playing a Hero they're new at, at least one person is lagging, at least one person is at a drastically different skill level than the rest of the team, etc. Don't give up and AFK, ever, but if you've tried getting people on the same page two or three times and it's not getting better, it might not be worth the emotional energy to keep going. Keep making plays, pinging, etc., but don't try to lecture after a certain point because it's going to create unnecessary tension.  On the other hand, it isn't difficult to nicely tell people to check the minimap, make sure the team is around before engaging, make sure they aren't walking into a trap, make sure if one person dies that four people don't show up to an uneven fight, make sure you don't get to a Tribute early and die in the bushes to the other team who has gotten there first, blah blah blah. If you lose your main damage because of a bad play and it's now 5v4, just say, ""our damage is down, gotta soak until res"" or whatever is the most appropriate second option. Try to provide that second option -- it looks less hostile and the team will almost always appreciate the direction. My general feeling is people are scared to speak up in chat, so they just do whatever and hope things come together. So most people do not care, and even appreciate, if one or two people are calling shots and organizing plays/objectives. You don't have to be a pedant to get people to listen. Think about how you would try to motivate a sports team or coworkers. Think about it from the other people's perspective, as well as your own. How would I want to be told to improve? How would pretty much everyone I know want to be told how to improve? If you go into it with the wrong mindset, you're not going to be able to ""fake"" good people skills. Give people the benefit of the doubt. If they prove you wrong, it's a lost cause and it's best to let go of whatever happens next.  Just keep perspective. You can't win them all. Some people won't listen. But it's important to remember that the glass is not half empty and not to remember too vividly perfectly average losses. In an average loss, a dude facechecks a bush, gets a 60 second res timer, your team starts getting split up on deaths, GG. That is not the end of the Western civilization, even though it sucks and feels disappointing. Still, it's not an exceptional loss and it's not worth the energy to remember the facechecking Valla not listening to you. It's not worth remembering because it happens to everyone -- we've all facechecked bushes, and that team that just beat you because of a dumb play from Valla had three people on it who just lost their last game because a guy facechecked bushes at the level 25 mark."

If there is a minion wave with you and they get hit by towers, the zombies can unleash their true potential, but if alone they don,t do this much dmg to structures.  As for defense, don't cast it around you if you are alone on your lane. First you are stuck between them and secondly all range heroes will kill you quickly.

If the enemy is low HP/has squishy heroes you can attempt to pick them off but DO NOT DIE. Staggering death timers can immediately lose you the game. Your objective in the situation should be:  1)To stay alive until the rest of your team spawns.   2)To equal out the levels (at least until you get your heroics)   3)Mitigate what damage you can to your structures safely  As for your team not helping you do these, COMMUNICATE.

If you hit plant first with all you team usually it will fall and you can pick off the hero inside it, which means you should have the advantage in a team fight.

NexusNewbies,3b89ym,finob,11,Fri Jun 26 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a ""carry"" in HoTS. Many people refer to high damage assassins (Jaina, Illidan, Kael'Thas, and so on) as carries. However, since HoTS is a team objective centric game, an entire team made up of 5 squishy assassins will have a hard time against a team with a tank and a dedicated healer, as they will be able to negate a large portion of your damage, and will flat out win any sort of elongated team fight.   Being a carry in the LoL or DOTA sense implies that you will be able to win the game by getting yourself fed and single handedly dominating the enemy team. However in HoTS, since all players share experience and takedowns, no one player can get ""fed"". You must work as a team."
NexusNewbies,3b89ym,partialdub,6,Fri Jun 26 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"Carries don't exist in HotS. A carry in other mobas is a hero that rises in power exponentially rather than linearly. The team carries them through the early part of the game when they are weak and squishy. If they are carried successfully and get a big enough xp advantage, they become unstoppable killing machines and carry their team to victory in the final stages of the game. You need to feed xp to the carry by facilitating safe and fast last hitting and setting up hero kills.   None of this exists in HotS but it helps to be aware of this dynamic. To answer your question, a team of 5 carries would get wiped out again and again and never get any XP because carries tend to be weak and easily killed early on by certain heroes."
NexusNewbies,3b89ym,cheesesamishen,0,Sat Jun 27 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"Well, Kael'Thas sort of fits, he's a hero who starts relatively weak, and gets stronger as the game keeps going, especially late game. And some champions start stronger, and their damage falls off as the game goes on."
NexusNewbies,3b89ym,tundranocaps,2,Sat Jun 27 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"Every hero has a different scaling curve, yes. Most assassins scale in a similar way. But there is no such thing as carrying and no way to make one individual more powerful than an entire team. Just the standard plate/leather/cloth power curves."
NexusNewbies,3b89ym,cheesesamishen,3,Sat Jun 27 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with ""Carry"" in the context of HotS. In other mobas, such as League of Legends, a carry is a champion who at a certain point in the game acts as the pivotal force on the team for engamements with the enemy team to the extent of out shining the contributions of other team members. Carries farm experience and gold with the support of their team so they can be strong enough overpower the enemy team. You wouldn't want to only have carry-based characters in those games because then the carries would 1) be competing against each for gold and 2) there wouldn't be any kill set up characters who would give the carries the ability to actually get their combos off.  Again, HotS doesn't have carries in this sense. Everyone on the team is pivotal because each represents ideally an equal impact on winning the game as a whole. The best way of seeing this is the impact of engaging 4v5. The team with more heroes present at a fight is so much more likely to win that it is usually best to just let the team with the larger numbers take the objective or at least stall long enough to equal the playing field.  Additionally, each role in HotS provides some almost essential function to winning a game. I will discuss only healing supports specifically here as the nuances of roles and hybrid roles is complex enough that one could write a book. In other mobas, the support is almost never considered a carry but rather an enabler who allows the carry to be even more awesome. In other words, when the carry reaches a certain point in their build in relation to the enemy team, the support is not necessary anymore for the carry to do the carrying for these other mobas, some might say.  In HotS, a healing support plays such an enormous role countering crowd control and damage from the enemy team that lacking the support in a serious engagement with the enemy team is extremely risky. Because healing supports don't do much damage typically, they rely on the rest of their team to destroy structures and kill enemy heroes. In other words, the healer despite all their impact on teamfights cannot carry their team from their actions alone at any point in the game."
NexusNewbies,3b89ym,Knowledgeless,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:07:02 2015 UTC,"A carry is a character that deals tons of damage but is extremely squishy.  In HOTS, they're long-or-melee-ranged assassins.  Carries do extremely high amounts of damage, so if your carry stays alive in the teamfight, they will be a deciding factor in whether or not your team wins that fight.  Carries are usually extremely squishy, weak early on, and susceptible to all sorts of crowd control.  You need other roles in a team to make up for the carry's weaknesses (like immobility or lack or escapes) and to protect the carry."

Malfurion is receiving an extreme buff and sits at 2k. Valla is amazing and 2k. Off the top of my head, I'd advise you to split your resources and get Valla, Anub, Malfurion and then save for Tassadar or perhaps Zagara? Gives you resources to learn multiple playstyles and since you earn 500 Gold each time you reach Lvl5, they help you more on the next ones. (Sorry, just read, that you already own Malf... So just ignore my request to buy him... Li Li is pretty fun and powerful, too.)  If you're dead set on buying one really expensive hero, I'd go with Jaina, Sylvanas, Kael'Thas or Brightwing. Jaina and Kael are somewhat redundand, Sylvanas is just crazy fun to play, but not the easiest of heroes (you'll always feel important, but you could be doing better with her all the time...), and Brightwing is a really good support. Complementing Arthas and Malf, I'd really lean towards Jaina. I tested Thrall and I did not really like him too much."

Yes, against AI it's all quite nice because they don't punish you hard, but against humans it's most likely going to 1for1 trades since if you don't get someone completely out of position, then you'll likely die, too. My requirement of assassins is not ti have a balanced takedown-death record, but a lot more on the plus side.

But as others have said, 10k heroes do not necessarily mean the best heroes. In fact, Thrall is my least favorite of all of them that I have played so far (I think I've played everyone but Nova, Murky, TLV and Abby). Gold becomes really hard to make once you hit the level cap, and you'll only make around 30-40k during that journey. You don't want to spend a chunk of that on a hero you'll regret buying.  If you're okay with spending real money (worth it if you think you'll be putting many hours into the game) you can buy the Starter bundle that includes Raynor, Malfurion and Muradin (all great at their roles) for $5 or the $20 starter pack which includes Jaina, Zagara, Zeratul, Lili and Sonya, as well as an extra Zeratul key (the costume unlocks both Zera and costume) and an exclusive mount.

If you are still deadset on buying a 10k hero, and buying it right now, I recommend Sylvanas.

NexusNewbies,3b7n98,BlasI,2,Fri Jun 26 18:32:43 2015 UTC,Better to save your Gold till you're around Level 30+. By then you should have about 40K Gold saved from leveling your Player Level and leveling Heroes up to Level 5 during the weekly free rotations.  At the point you will probably have played most of the cast of Heroes and can start picking out your 10 Heroes for Hero League.  Gold isn't all that easy to come by at the moment and you wouldn't want to blow your first 10K on a Hero you don't like playing.  If that 10K is really burning a hole in your pocket. Then I would suggest:   Sylvanas Brightwing Jaina   Also note that you can try out any Hero from the Shop before buying. But its better to play them during free weekly rotations to get a better feel for them.

Any other situation usually means I'm using a-click, because it's a safer way to deal damage.

NexusNewbies,3b2yft,Zuggy,3,Thu Jun 25 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"I played a match yesterday that was a perfect example of taking advantage of a misplay to come back for the win.  The game had been pretty even the entire match. The enemy team comes in and starts hitting our core, it was down to 15%, but they overestimated their damage and we wiped the team at above level 20. We had over a minute of no opposition on Spider Queen so we finished turning in gems, grabbed the boss and destroyed their core just as they were respawning."

NexusNewbies,3b3xy9,nawkuh,10,Thu Jun 25 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about tier lists.  In Hero League: Play what your team needs that you play best. Find stuff you like, do that well. I have seen a lot of bad Anubs lately who are playing it just because it's FOTM. In Hero League, if we need a tank, I take Muradin over Anub because I'm not good at Anub's playstyle. Muradin is not bad at all, but I see people who might be better at him taking Anub just because.  There are two reasons to be careful with Nova and Tassadar. In QM, support gets matched with support. Tassadar doesn't bring the healing that a Rehgar or Uther does, so if you run him against a Brightwing, you might have trouble. If you don't mind this, have fun. But if it bugs you, might wait until some resolution to this happens. In HL, Nova is not difficult to counter pick, so you need to be careful you aren't taking her first and then getting countered with a Tass/Uther combo. In HL, it's about picking what meshes with your team and what counters theirs. Do something you're good at that works with your team, rather than take Illidan when your team comp does not favor it.   Tier lists are subjective and display some amount of personal preference. For casual or even moderately tryhard play, don't worry about them. You will find that if you like a ""weaker"" Hero, the weaknesses are obvious to you -- so a tier list telling you he isn't as good as Brightwing isn't particularly helpful, right?   I played Murky when he was really not good. A buff had to be coming for him -- BELIEVE! -- and when it did, I had a headstart. I'm not Best Murky NA, but if you really love a Hero, just stick with it. You will be rewarded and have fun in the process."
NexusNewbies,3b3xy9,__shoe__,6,Thu Jun 25 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"Any champion is good if you are good at them, tiers don't really mean anything except for pro play."

As much as i like Nova, she is a gimmick pick and can be completely shut down by several heroes.    Now, if your team needs an assassin, the enemy team isn't stacked with counters (tassadar, tyrande, etc) and there's a lot of squishy on the other side... then yeah, there is no problem bringing strong Nova play to a HL match, regardless of what this month's flavor is."
NexusNewbies,3b3xy9,bsmntdwlr,3,Thu Jun 25 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"Short answer, no. The ""tiers"" are defined by meta at the highest level of play and can differ greatly based on what region you are in. The ""best"" heroes are sometimes the hardest to play. In rare instances, a hero will be nerfed a lot and may seem unplayable, but keep in mind that the two most important metrics for selecting a hero is 1) how well does it compliment my team composition or the strategy they want to use (split pushing vs. hard engagements) and 2) how well do you typically do with this hero in your skill bracket.  I have seen every hero played well, and only in the cases of heavy recent nerfs or strong enemy team counters do I consider hero selection as influencing a casual game's outcome."

NexusNewbies,3b3436,Shanaki,2,Fri Jun 26 12:12:09 2015 UTC,"A is to issue an attack-move command. You press A then left click the location you want your hero to move. Your hero will then move to that location and auto-attack any minions, mercs (that have been captured), objective spawns, ability spawns, or heroes.  When quick cast is turned on, the attack-move command takes on the qualities of quick cast. You will no longer have to left click, the hero will move to wherever your cursor was placed when you pressed A.  For abilities, it works rather the same. If it is a skill shot, the ability will go in the direction your cursor was pointing rather than having to left click. It goes off instantly. Same with targeted abilities, it will go off on whatever target your cursor is over when you activate the ability without having to left click. The only abilities that are different are positional skill shots, like Brightwing's Q. She will move into range of where you're cursor was before casting."
NexusNewbies,3aztzf,jeskette,7,Wed Jun 24 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"Removing line of sight is a huge deal. Most attacks require line of sight. Several times I've been able to get away clean when a stronger hero was trying to take me down, by running a tight circle around a map object until I had an opportunity to slip away. If Illidan doesn't have clean line of sight, then he can't slice me to ribbons.  Running through mist or grass will remove line of sight, and remove opportunities to attack.  Also, use mist or grass to hide in when you are laning and waiting for minions, or if you are summoning a mount or hearthstoning back to base. It greatly reduces the likelihood of getting ganked, and may even give you an opportunity to jump someone else."
NexusNewbies,3aztzf,HaiKarate,3,Wed Jun 24 21:05:49 2015 UTC,Yeah good points. I forgot to mention about mounting up or backing while out of line of sight.

NexusNewbies,3aztzf,EsquireSandwich,2,Thu Jun 25 12:16:04 2015 UTC,"It is completely okay to die sometimes. It's way to common to see Sylvanas split pushing only to get a fort down to very low health then try to run and end up dying. It's better to die and take the fort down with you.   If your choices are die and take the fort or die without taking the fort, then yes. But the most preferred option, usually, is to realize the other team is coming for you and back out earlier. You stay alive, don't give the other team any xp, can farm some extra xp for yourself, and can always come back and finish that fort later."
NexusNewbies,3aztzf,EsquireSandwich,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:44:51 2015 UTC,1 death for a for is worth it 99% of the time no matter what the circumstances are. The xp they gain from the death is not greater than the xp and map advantage you gain for destroying it.
NexusNewbies,3aztzf,kaloryth,7,Thu Jun 25 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"Depending on the how late in the game it is, your also putting your team at a 4v5 for what could be a very significant period of time. You can back out and come back in a minute to finish the fort off and basically get the same result with no loss.   This is especially true for a fort. A keep is more worth it, because you get a much bigger advantage for killing the keep than you do a fort.  Yes the xp from the from the structure probably outweighs the xp from the death, but how long will you be down for and whether your opponents can capitalize on the 4v5 is huge. If the objective spawns while you are dead, it could be devastating.  I just think the better, long-term tip is ""do what you can to survive, but if you realize that you are going to die, try to get a kill or take a structure with you."
NexusNewbies,3aztzf,N8CCRG,2,Thu Jun 25 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"No, this is absolutely not the case. When you die, regardless of whether it is from creeps or heroes, you give experience to the other team, and you are... well dead. You are out of the game.  If your team is ahead in levels, your death is worth SIGNIFICANTLY more than they are. If you are ahead in levels, 1 vs 1 trade is not a good trade. Likewise, a fort for a hero who is ahead is not a good trade either.   Yes, you get an advantage in that you get more map control by destroying a fort, but staying a couple extra seconds to get that fort down and dying because of it is RARELY worth it if you're ahead (OR EVER).  When you die, you can no longer participate in team fights. You can no longer contest objectives. You have given them exp. You are putting your team at a disadvantage for the duration of your death and until you can get back into position.  So no, 99% of the time you want to remain map aware and back out and COME BACK LATER. For most heroes, the most important thing to do in the game is NOT DIE."
NexusNewbies,3aztzf,Rayalas,0,Thu Jun 25 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"I got body blocked twice this week. Once by an Anub when I was a Brightwing trying to retreat from a Naz. He knew exactly when I was going to attempt to switch direction. Fortunately, self healing kept me alive just long enough to get back to my fort and away with double digit hp.  The second time was today when we were pushing a gate. The other team came from behind and I attempted to retreat, only to find myself pinned in by my Siege Giants and my own teammate Sgt. Hammer. The pathing ai couldn't figure out that I couldn't get past them and just sat there and stuttered for like 3-4 seconds before I finally got killed."

NexusNewbies,3b1pvj,MercWithaMouse,7,Thu Jun 25 06:54:44 2015 UTC,Tyrande is pretty good. another stun plus the damage amp makes a good roaming comp. not to mention a patch up heal for between  fights.
NexusNewbies,3b1pvj,CynicCorvus,6,Thu Jun 25 07:46:12 2015 UTC,"I've seen people recommend Tyrande, Uther, ETC, or Muradin.

Other than that I like Muradin because he's my favorite warrior to play, plus the stun and escape."
NexusNewbies,3b1pvj,TXKSSnapper,4,Thu Jun 25 07:54:56 2015 UTC,I'm surprised nobody mentioned Nova. I play Kerrigan a lot and when I play with a Nova we always make a great ganking duo. You just ask the three others to lane peacefully while you clean lane after lane. Most of the time we manage to be 2 levels ahead by level 10.
NexusNewbies,3b1pvj,henrax,3,Thu Jun 25 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"Jaina and Kael'Thas can make good use of Kerrigan's Combo, as can Nova, Zeratul, and Falstad."
NexusNewbies,3b1pvj,MitruMesre,3,Thu Jun 25 09:04:55 2015 UTC,"An unusual duo (thats not burst) that no one ever thinks of is malfurion.   Kerrigan is extremely mana hungry. Malfurion's D will sustain that mana hunger. If kerrigan pulls of a stun combo, malfurions root will keep them in place awhile longer. You can harass quite easily. and set up team plays."
NexusNewbies,3b1pvj,kataxist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:57:20 2015 UTC,Any burst dps is good with Kerrigan since she basically pulls off her combo and another dps hero can unload during the stun. Great for ganking but really HotS is more about full team composition and not just duo composition.  Also any other hero with an additional stun is good so you can chain stun. But yeah if you just want to get a good pick for a friend of yours to queue with then probably Tyrande or Uther so you get some support and additional stuns.

NexusNewbies,3b061j,MadDingersYo,6,Wed Jun 24 22:22:50 2015 UTC,As a rule of thumb for the first 10 levels or so it's better to stay in lanes and soak XP only leaving for objectives. Takedowns are not important in these first 10 levels and it's better to stay back killing minions and staying alive. If you have the chance to kill a hereo easily by all means do so but they won't grant as much XP. But staying alive and soaking XP is more important.   I'm new to the MOBA genre as well. Never played League or Dota or even WC3. I'm still on a steep learning curve and am constantly learning with each new game.   EDIT: This video explains it well
NexusNewbies,3b061j,elaboratekicks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:11:50 2015 UTC,Thanks very much!
NexusNewbies,3b061j,C_Morley,4,Thu Jun 25 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"Your points:  XP gain is an important metric, to be sure, but really you should only use the 'stats' as a rough guide to performance. As well as being able to play characters' abilities well, it's incredibly important to learn which tactics are most effective in which situation> As a ganking character, you would expect to have lower xp gain, but higher kills than your team (eg Nova, Kerrigan). If that is the case EVERY time you play, then you are probably not playing your character in the best way, and are likely playing them as a ganker even if they are not. You mention you like warriors, and tanks tend to have high kills, simply because they should always be present in a teamfight. NOT all warriors are tanks however - Tyrael and Sonya are brawlers, and should be played more like lane bullys and gankers. The single most important stat to look at is Deaths. ANY time you die, you have made a mistake. Maybe other players have too that has contributed to that too, but you should really be striving for a 0 death game. To be clear, most of the time you won't achieve this, but understanding WHY you died, and what you could have done to prevent that is incredibly important. You can almost always tell the good players from the bad by number of deaths. To give insight into why this is the most important stat, when you die, you not only give the enemy team xp, but you make it so that your team is 1 person down, meaning they will likely lose any even teamfight, or so they have to play more conservatively and lose map presence. As well as that, you are denying your team 1/5 XP gain potential for the whole time youre dead, putting you even further behind. A 1 for 1 trade is only worth it if you a) are behind in levels, since you'll get more xp then they will, b) killing a character that relies on gathering power (Nova, Kaelthas, sometimes zeratul) or c) killing a critical member of their team, when you are not (eg if you are a valla in a team with plenty of other dps, and you take out their Illidan if they are a dive comp)  People in HL can definitely be more toxic. To understand this, players have a lot more invested. Dropping a rank in HL can be a dent in hours of effort from a player, so they are a lot more critical. The best way to handle this is to be positive, play sensibly, only play characters you know well, but also try to compliment the team as best you can. Ignore people who get really toxic. It might also be worth looking at some tier lists. there's a good chance if you pick Nova on Haunted Mines, everyone will hate you for it. Not only is she a VERY bad hero on that map, but she's currently quite weak in the meta. http://getbonkd.com/tierlist/ Keep an open mind on these lists though, ANY hero is viable on any map, but you should pick based on the opposing team, your team, and map.  That's a big variation in winrate! You should definitely look into it. Luck will probably account for a lot of it, but it's significant enough to show that you are probably doing something wrong on BB. BB is a difficult map, because you have a lot more to keep track of. Part of the problem with BB is that it encourages a lot of splitting up, since there are so many camps and objective points, but then it also encourages grouping up to turn in coins. You need very good map awareness to pull this off. If you get caught in a 2 or 3 when the enemy has just turned in and they're all there, you'll probably all die. Be aware of where the enemy are at all times. Remember where you last saw people, and work out where they could now be. Another mistake is turning in with only 1 or 2 people present. This is pretty much a death sentence and a loss of those coins, so don't do it, unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure the enemy won't stumble on you.   You should watch the getbonkd videos as they are really good guides that focus well on positioning mistakes."

Maybe other players have too that has contributed to that too, but you should really be striving for a 0 death game.   God, flashback to a QM I played yesterday where I had to take a ton of shit from some asshole for being a Muradin and leading the team in deaths. Pretty pathetic to be sure, but we also had a Lanyor who ""Doesn't teamfight"" because he is ""better at ganking"" and an Illidan with <10k hero damage who captured exactly 0 camps.   Sometimes deaths can be the teams fault, especially if the team does not communicate properly."
NexusNewbies,3b061j,DrMikeTyson,2,Thu Jun 25 13:46:34 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, it's also your fault because you knowingly engaged in a lopsided fight over and over.

It wasn't even a situation where we could get there to back him up he would just hit his charge into the middle of a group regardless of where everyone else was on the map (or who was dead) and then complain about it.

NexusNewbies,3b061j,Thizzlebot,3,Thu Jun 25 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yep HotS is my first MOBA as well. I thought I would never play a MOBA game because of the communities these games have. Then Blizzard made HotS and one day I just wanted to give it a shot when I learned that Blizzard does not support toxic behaviour. Tried it for luls and been hooked since. I have over 600 games, but a lot of them are against AI though since I wanted to get some basics down first. When I stepped in the Hero League it was totally a different experience. I am rank 28 in HL at the moment. I can say that soaking xp early game till 10, not overextending and thus not dying is very very important indeed.  I also hate Blackheart's Bay map, don't like it at all, but if you have the team that sticks together you probably win it in low ranks. Until higher ranks it's often enough to guarantee a victory if you can convince your team to deliver coins together, collect them SAFELY and disrupt your enemy team from delivering them.  Also when it comes to low rank/low skill games do not take seriously ANYTHING what toxic dumbasses say there.  HOWEVER since this matchmaking sometimes does weird things and pair high ranks with low ranks, if you get teammates who seem to have some experience with the game and actually give tips BEFORE mistakes happen then you should definitely listen and try to do your best to help. This is called shotcalling and you should NOT ignore these calls as a newbie. These people are often a blessing and can win you games and give pointers on what you can do to improve your play. Some people may take these tips as toxic behaviour, but given correctly, it's not toxic at all just guidance and I like them and want as much of them as possible to learn more and get better.  Communication is very important when playing with equally skilled players and if you have a team that can constructively chat with each other, you probably win those games while having a ton of fun. Just few days back I had my best day in HotS yet and it was in HL. Somehow I was finally teamed up with nice normal human beings instead of toxic turds and I won 8 games in a row. I'm not saying there are toxic turds in every game, but often when someone is chatting, it's toxic.  In higher ranks consistency is a big word. Hitting skillshots, getting combos, avoiding skillshots and general map awareness gets a very important role. Mechanical skill is not acquired in short time duration so for new moba players like us, we just have to try to enjoy games, get some losses, improve our skills game by game.  I felt this was something I wanted to share here :)"

NexusNewbies,3b061j,N8CCRG,2,Thu Jun 25 03:52:12 2015 UTC,"Experience is earned primarily from being around killed enemy minions, but also champion kills.  Blackheart Bay is all about getting coins from mercenaries camps and chests, turning in coins to the pirate, and stopping the enemy from doing the same.  Getting the first coin turn in on the map is very important.  The top vision points is also important because it makes getting two of the small coin camps safer.  It's the map where laning is the least important. BB is one of my best maps."
NexusNewbies,3b0t5t,clenchedbuttocks,7,Thu Jun 25 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"Your post explains in a roundabout way, why the stats screen does not tell the full story of your contribution to a team.  Yes, Zagara has a high capability for delivering siege damage and pushing a lane, but if you are focusing on map objectives (as you should be), that capability will not always be reflected in the stats.  Blackhearts Bay is a great example of that, because you can spend the whole time collecting and returning coins (thus contributing to your teams result), but as you pointed out, it won't be relfected in the damage scores.  Your talent build will also have an effect on this. If you are focusing on creep spread talents, you might miss out on other talents that will boost your siege/hero damage. The vision the creep will grant your team will help immensely in a way that is not quantified.  Short Version: Don't sweat the stat screen, it only tells part of the story!"
NexusNewbies,3b0t5t,Crimefighter500,2,Thu Jun 25 11:05:17 2015 UTC,"As Crimefighter500 said, don't get to obsessed with the stat screen numbers. I think it should be removed, or only shown at the end of the game, because lots of players think that those numbers are the absolute measure how well someone is doing in the game. There was a game where one of my teammate continously trolled and harrased my other teammate (warrior), because his numbers was low, but he carried the game with play calls, objectives, damage soaking, peeling etc. It was obvious that he was an experienced player, but this other team memeber just bullied him because those stupid e-peen numbers... So my suggestion: forget those numbers, and help your team. If they start complaining about your gameplay that's okay, if they complain about the numbers just tell them to stfu."
NexusNewbies,3ayaap,CPaladino,12,Wed Jun 24 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"I almost exclusively play Team League and we usually stick to a 1-1-1 setup with two roamers/gankers (usually Anub + Zeratul).   On a map like Dragon Shire it's a good idea to make sure you claim one of the objectives and then slowly out-rotate the opponents (you don't HAVE to get the Dragon Knight).  On Haunted Mines we do the usual 4-1 setup with a strong laner like Tassadar being alone, but we always change it up according to the enemy teamcomposition.  Always have at least one guy on each lane to soak the XP."
NexusNewbies,3ayaap,kvkBEAST,4,Wed Jun 24 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer to this question.  It's  less about what you're supposd to do and more about finding the ""why"" you should do it.  On haunted mines and enemy is 4/1? Don't just blindly mirror them, throw out a 2/3 and counter them, for example."

NexusNewbies,3ayaap,andraes,6,Wed Jun 24 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a good grasp on the principles, and that's all that really matters.  Laning in Heroes is about getting XP and trying to not give XP, aka maintaining soak and staying alive.    I see a lot of people who get by them selves in a lane and freak out and just run away.  If the enemy team is pushing 2v1 in your lane and you can stay alive, (even if it's hiding behind your gate sometimes) and still get minion XP, that's a good contribution to the team because it means somewhere else your team is out numbering them.    If you do feel like you need to rotate, or the enemies in your lane are hard countering you then just communicate to your team and get a switch.  As you play more different heroes you'll understand which heroes are good against which and you know early on if you'll be okay in a lane alone or not."
NexusNewbies,3ayaap,ReKaYaKeR,2,Wed Jun 24 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"Temple, 2 / 2 / 1 because the first temples spawn top mid.  Haunted mines a common strat is a 4 / 1 or 1 / 4 split.   I really like 1 / 1 / 1 with a brightwing / warrior or assassin. That way brightwing can pop into a lane that is having trouble else they can roam and do camps with great sustain."
NexusNewbies,3ayaap,BlasI,2,Wed Jun 24 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"Is there a more general tactic that someone can explain (or confirm that I have it correct)?   No, as it depends almost entirely on what the objectives are and how they work.  For example, on Sky Temple you almost always want to start with 2-2-1, as the first two temples to spawn are ALWAYS the top and mid ones.  On haunted mines you want a 4-1 split so that as soon as the mines open you can start roaming as a group.  On Cursed Hollow you want 1-3-1 so that the 3 in the middle can easily go top or bottom depending on where the first tribute is."

If you're running away from a non-melee hero or you have some sort of gap closer you can run into the hedge and fly out the back or outplay them if you're lucky.  It's a very rare case when it comes in handy, but it's there, and if you are waiting on a cooldown and are about to get ganked, it can give you the right edge. Again, provided they don't have AoE, in which case they'll just run near and start damaging you."

NexusNewbies,3aximo,alandluk,11,Wed Jun 24 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas is ridiculous when it comes to pushing lanes in conjunction with a boss. By disabling the towers, the boss lasts a lot longer and just wrecks everything.   Now, apply that to haunted mines with it's massively strong golems and you can see the potential. She basically forces the other team to have to defend against even a fairly weak golem.   That's on top of the fact that she can destroy a lane by herself while everyone is in the mines fighting for skulls.  You basically can't allow a Sylvanas player to split push unless you want to lose towers and forts."
NexusNewbies,3aximo,shinjinrui,6,Wed Jun 24 08:26:01 2015 UTC,Personal experience: In the HM map where u usually split 4-1 in the 2 lanes. Sylv will stick with the 4 and go siege build and wreck the towers/gates so fast before the first mines open. So ur golem will just walk straight and attack their fort.  Then she can proceed to soak the other lane and try to wreck the other tower/gate too while ur team 4v5 in the mines.   Or she could just push down the fort while the enemy team are in the mines.

NexusNewbies,3aximo,Hiroxis,3,Wed Jun 24 10:22:51 2015 UTC,"As the others have said already, Sylvanas in general is incredibly strong when pushing with camps, and this is only amplified with the stronger golem on Haunted Mines.   The thing is that the enemy team can't really push with their golem ever, except if they have something like 90 to 10 skulls. Sylvanas can push so well with the golem, so the enemy team has to either a) push with their golem and lose a lot of structures or b) defend against your golem and get very little out of their golem"
NexusNewbies,3aximo,rrrrupp,2,Wed Jun 24 11:04:33 2015 UTC,"Assuming the team knows how to use her, it's huge to have her on that map.  I'm seen some Sylvanas play defense instead of pushing. In that case, no she's not really OP."

Anub'Arak, Brightwing, Jaina, Illidan,  The Last Vikings, and Sylvanas all received some nerfs this upcoming patch (judging by the PTR notes), while Murky got some indirect nerfs from Envenom/Blood for Blood's nerfs, if he were to pick them.  tl;dr? Kael'Thas, but aside from that can't be answered until next patch is live for a while and people can judge how the prior patch's effects shift things about. Most of the healers getting changed, the ""dazed"" as opposed to ""stunned"", and proliferation of Cleanse might change the meta in unforeseen ways.

NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,N8CCRG,6,Tue Jun 23 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"Just because you're playing a melee hero does not mean you are a tank. Don't run into a group of enemies thinking your team is going to follow you and help you. You won't magically soak all the damage either. That's the thing with HotS: Most (if not all) of the heroes are squishier than heroes in DotA or champions in League of Legends. If you came from another MOBA, you have to know that you can't take run through all 5 enemies and somehow magically survive while they chase you. You'll end up dying.  If that isn't the case, take a here like Muradin or ETC. They're a lot easier to use and they can help you practice how long you should stay in a fight, when and how you should engage, and how to play during a team fight.   Watch your allies. Even though you know your team would have won the fight, watch your allies. Some of them are scum-sucking road whores and just leave you after they auto-attack twice. As much as I hate it, run away with them. It's better you disengage and run away with those weak scums than you staying in a fight and dying by yourself.   Also, as a melee, don't be afraid to back off a little so you don't take as much damage; heal a little and go back in. Just make sure you stay to where you can kind of zone out your enemies and prevent them from shoving themselves right in the middle of your team.  Most of the melee heroes have a small self-healing or some kind of cc. Use it on their assassins or supports and just constantly focus down assassins. Try to put yourself in a place where you can force them to split up. Be like Moses and just split dat Red Sea down the middle. Once they're separated, just shove your big, throbbing axe/sword/hammer up their asshole and kill them off. If you're playing ETC, make sure you always use that self-healing ability (I forgot what it's called).  Remember, it's okay to back off a little so that you don't take too much damage/pressure."

NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,fanboyhunter,2,Thu Jun 25 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"Melee assassins, or warriors? Either way, it probably has to do with initiations - as an assassin, you generally can not initiate, you need to stay around the edges of a fight and dive in to pick off their squishies when the opportunity presents itself. If you're the warrior, you have to know how to pick the right spots to initiate, and have trust in your team to follow up. In a good initiation, you're still reasonably likely to die, but hopefully as a good trade for your team.  In either case it can be useful to save your mobility skills to make an escape, unless they're absolutely necessary to get into the fight, along with practicing your awareness and reaction time to bail when the enemies turn on you."

NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,Mr_Kid,2,Wed Jun 24 07:59:03 2015 UTC,"Once you know your enemies, you'll know when it's safe to go in as a melee assassin. Wait for your enemies to use their big damage moves on your tank. Follow the tank, since he should be the one to initiate fights. Go for their ranged assassins or punish someone for being out of position. Learn good positioning yourself so that you're not picked off.  On positioning, keep yourself out of enemy sight as much as possible. Use bushes or corners for ganks. If there aren't any safe bushes available, keep your tank between you and your enemy. Don't wander off by yourself."

Re-position and strike again. For more tanky heroes honestly it will depend on your ability to cover your escape with stuns, shields and other delay tactics until a team-mate can bail you out. A good support will be your friend."
NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,hacdladf1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"Watch for their team to drop their stuns, slows, etc before you go in and drop your combo (mainly for assassins)  A lot of heroes have specific ways/tricks to survive while being effective and there's not really much broad advice for all melee characters that you can give apart from what I just said. It might help if you could be more specific. Are you having problems with all melee characters? Or just one class type like assassins or warriors? Or 2-3 specific heroes who just happen to all be melee?"

NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,hacdladf1,4,Wed Jun 24 07:57:39 2015 UTC,"Rehgar stays back until the fight is over. He's decent at chasing and cleaning up kills with his feral lunge and special mount. You want to auto attack someone who is deep into your team, but apart from that you're not there for damage so you should never be on the front lines.  Say you're on Kerrigan, once you use her Q W E and possibly Envenom/Blood fo Blood combo, then what do you do? You should immediately run out. Don't stay for auto attacks, don't try to wait out your cool downs in the middle of their team. If they started attacking you, you want to use Sprint or Bolt of the Storm if you took them, otherwise you want to save them for obvious reasons.   The whole move back after you drop your combo applies to Zeratul and Thrall as well. Illidan plays a bit different than all the other melee assassins. Playing well with him is incredibly difficult. Most people can't do it. I honestly wouldn't even try to get good with him if you're having trouble with other melee characters. If you do, his Q and W both double as escapes. Go for their back line and when things start to get rough, use your Q on their front line and W away if it's off cooldown.   There's two types of warriors, tanks and bruisers. For tanks, your job isn't to kill their heroes. You're more of a bodyguard. You stand in between your squishy Jaina and their team and if someone goes for her, then you stun them slow them or whatever you got. If the enemy team starts to focus you, then simply run back and stay behind your healer until he can heal you. If you have any ranged attacks you can throw them out.  Tyrael, Anub'arak, Sonya, and Stitches are all in the bruiser category. They go for the healers and assassins and can take more of a punch than assassins. They're basically hybrid warrior assassins.   Never ever fight when you're down a man, just run. Like it's not worth it. In the first place you should never be in a situation where you'll stumble on a bigger group of them than your team, but if you do then just run. Second place, you're going to lose unless you can instantly drop some of them to make it even. The chances of them being low enough health and close enough to you is so low that it's probably not even worth remembering this. Just run and ping retreat.  For every single hero, staying alive is paramount and thus when you get low on health, you go behind the back line. It does not matter if you are a warrior or assassin or healer or whatever. Once you get low, you go back and there's nothing wrong with that.   Watch for their big damage skills and stuns before you go in as an assassin. You want to go as deep as you can and get out in the shortest amount of time. Bruisers want to go as deep as they can for as long as they can. Tanks want stay in the shallow end for as long as possible. All without dying."
NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,TXKSSnapper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:25:56 2015 UTC,"thanks for this detailed answer. One more specific question I have:    I'm playing ETC a lot this week. He's a tankier character, and I understand my role is to soak and peel for my allies. My problem is that I get a bit trigger happy and spam my Q W.    what should I be saving these for (if at all?) how much damage are they adding, and should I reserve them for peels/stuns or cycle them for damage/stuns during the teamfight?    may be a vague question, I'm just trying to learn the best times to use abilities for everyone."
NexusNewbies,3aw2nq,TXKSSnapper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"This is a good question. They're not adding much damage at all. The only thing you want to be spamming is your E, the self heal and attack speed bonus for your team with a low mana cost are what you want. ETC isn't someone you play solo honestly. Like he's fun and awesome because he's a cow with a guitar, but he really can't do much on his own. He needs a solid team to be effective.  You should be saving them, but I'm not too sure what you should be saving them for honestly. I'll try though. W is great for peeling. Thrall tries to run in? Boop, push him back. Gives your team time to notice and maybe focus him down if he's still coming in. You can use your Q to secure kills, like say someone's <25% health but they're going to escape. Q past them, then run and W them towards your team. Q is a great initiator for Mosh Pit. Also, if anyone gets into your team, their tank, bruiser, assassin, whatever, then you should use Q to stun them and give your team the chance to escape and/or kill him.  ETC is also good at singling out squishies if he has a good assassin backing him up. Q into the back of their team and W that assassin/healer away from the rest while his assassin partner goes off to the side and focuses him down. You're not going to get that down with just a random person though."

NexusNewbies,3axmiq,N8CCRG,0,Wed Jun 24 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that's almost always what I do. I just had an unchallenged lane most of the game and I guess decided to be lazy."
NexusNewbies,3axmiq,kamimaiku,3,Thu Jun 25 06:39:33 2015 UTC,"No, turn in doesn't give experience by itself. You just soaked more than your team."
NexusNewbies,3axmiq,lazydemon,2,Wed Jun 24 09:12:39 2015 UTC,Meaning I killed a lot of minions? Still not even entirely sure what soaking means.
NexusNewbies,3axmiq,pHageHunter,0,Wed Jun 24 09:15:13 2015 UTC,Soaking is just not being near dying minions. last hitting is not a thing in hots.
NexusNewbies,3axmiq,lazydemon,2,Wed Jun 24 09:19:53 2015 UTC,Last hit will still give you xp if you are further away than the normal xp soaking range (common with Azmodan).
NexusNewbies,3awgno,jeskette,4,Wed Jun 24 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"Killing Murky means little to nothing. I wouldn't worry about being squishy. He's there to bait enemy damage and kite them around as a distraction. If they are chasing you often, you're doing your job."
NexusNewbies,3awgno,RogueT3ch,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:26:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, as well as providing body blocks for your team to escape if need be. Furthermore if left alone he will take down lanes as he does a lot of damage. He is not ideal on bhb though. With a nova and an abathur murky is truly a problem."
NexusNewbies,3awgno,gpnrunxm,4,Wed Jun 24 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"He's freaking amazing on maps like Dragon Shrine that require you to hold a point. I've had a few games where I took a point by killing Murky, no problem. 5 seconds later, he was back, and I killed him, no problem, but now I'm down to about half mana and health.   5 seconds later, he's at full health and cooldowns, and I kill him, but now I realize I'm not going to survive another fight.  He comes back another 5 seconds, kills me, I'm on a 30 second cooldown, and we lose Dragon. He traded a full kill for a full kill, because his deaths were only worth .25, but we couldn't take dragon the whole map because of him."
NexusNewbies,3awgno,AmnesiaCane,2,Wed Jun 24 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"Murky can be especially useful. The caveat is that you fight a big uphill battle to make that happen. You have tp have the right map, comp, and enemy comp to make Murky viable.   The amount of time you spend making Murky work for you could be better used learning hero that is useful in every situation, such as Sylvanas."
NexusNewbies,3awgno,xaelra,2,Wed Jun 24 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"On Hot Slogs Murky has a low usage rate but a high win rate, which tells me he is dangerous in the right hands.  I've never had any real success though."
NexusNewbies,3awgno,cm512,2,Wed Jun 24 13:51:42 2015 UTC,"Murky has inordinate amount of health regen and coupled with one of the best escapes in the game on comparatively short cooldown, he isn't as squishy as he looks.  His burst damage is one of the best and lategame you will be seeing 1k+ damage all the time.   He excels in lategame because his burst can kill any assassin in a single combo and he doesn't care if he dies doing that. For him it's a 5s respawn when his target will be away for 60s."

YES MURKY IS THE BEST HERO 2015"
NexusNewbies,3awgno,vulzashi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"Murky is amazing. I bought him a few days ago and I'm already addicted to his playstyle.  Murky is a amazing lane clearer, he can basically one combo the entire wave go to another lane combo it too and go back to the first lane to do it again. I'm top siege dmg and xp cont almost all game with him.  At early game his kinda weak but after the slime on blowfish talent he can burst any assassin into the game with the blowfish+slime+Octo Grab combo. Last game I just won a duel against Illidan because of double Blowfish double slime Octograb combo on him. Feel good xD."

NexusNewbies,3avnvd,Mundology,2,Tue Jun 23 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"I don't get BFB as Sylvanas, unless I'm feeling assassin-y.  Cold Embrace tends to do a better job in team fights anyway. Envenom nerf stings (because her other level 4 talents are below average) but she's just slightly worse at single target bursting. That's not really your job so I'm not sure it'll change anything."
NexusNewbies,3avnvd,dooblevay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"New Blood for Blood might be really nice on Anub'Arak, who's not as tanky as other tanks, as it'd heal him more, the loss of the slow can hurt. Both Epicenter and Imposing Presence are nice talents though.  I'd probably recommend Stoneskin on Illidan. He has to dive in and is pretty squishy. Illidan's ultimate was never about the damage, though it was a nice bonus, so no reason to change anything there.  As for Sylvanas and Kerrigan, time will tell."
NexusNewbies,3avnvd,tundranocaps,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"For Anub'arak I think the nerfs will effect damage most but his self healing should still be clutch. Swarm's healing was not based on damage done, but rather an amount for each enemy hit so no change. Blood for Blood should heal more now. The healing from beetles (if you chose that talent) will be effected (I'm hoping only slightly). YMMV and you should try it out for yourself, but I don't think his value as a tank will fundamentally change. He's still big and good at getting in the way, has 2 excellent CC abilities, a good escape, and staying power (self healing). Slower movement speed on the beetles will situationally change his ability to be immune to skill shots."
NexusNewbies,3avnvd,MadHatter5045,0,Wed Jun 24 18:59:39 2015 UTC,The PTR just went live. I would suggest logging on to there and trying out the changes. Nothing teaches like experience.
NexusNewbies,3au9rm,Uberdavid,4,Tue Jun 23 15:43:27 2015 UTC,"1: You shouldn't be hard engaging a fight you should be the follow up, let your tank get in and then you R so you get access to the back line.  2: You are a lane bully, especially if you went with the shield at lvl 1.  Hardly anyone should be able to out damage your early game dominance except Jaina and Kael since they can blow up minion waves, but if you are careful with positioning and use your dash and dive to dodge their AOEs you should come out on top.    3: Positioning in fights is key, you want to stay to the side of where the team fight is going to start at, as you are very important at both the follow up and clean up process of team fights.  You want to do your best to have your Metamorphosis hit the backline where their damage dealers are, but hit as many people as possible for the damage.  Then Attack the nearest damage dealer or healer and go to town.  If you take the Hunt your job is to split push though, wait for the enemy team to commit then swoop to take out their DPS."
NexusNewbies,3au9rm,zekselden,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"One last thing, if a get shrink rayed should i stay in the fight and just press E or should i Q to their tank and get out safely to get back in with my cooldowns up and un-shrinkrayed?"
NexusNewbies,3au9rm,zekselden,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"Usually I would say to leave and comeback after you are normal again, it can be difficult to keep from dying when you can't fight back.  Dive out and wait.  Decide if it is safe to go back in, as your follow up is now most likely on CD it can be hard to reengage the back line and they may have done a lot of damage to you team. You do not want to  rely on your Q except for chasing low health targets and body blocking so be careful when you try to Q onto the tank to escape as you may just get CC's as you do it."
NexusNewbies,3au9rm,Soupramacist,3,Tue Jun 23 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"For laning, it really depends on who's in the lane with you. If the enemy has a Zagara in your lane you might want to switch or call for help because she can absolutely destroy you 1v1 in the early game."
NexusNewbies,3au9rm,Eriennyl,2,Tue Jun 23 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"1 - You shouldn't be the engage. Your job is to punish the backlines or the ones retreating since u can chase really well have good gap closers.  2 -  You will want to be in a safe lane as u're squishy and in melee. Being in lane with a enemy melee AA is often the best, or range to a certain extend. Just W in the mobs, poke the back mobs and press E if enemy pokes u back, then Q to a front enemy mob to get back to ur own mobs. Once u have Immolation at lvl 4 u can start poking slightly more aggressively.   3 -  Start close to ur team, let them blow ults so u don't get insta-gibbed in a split sec the moment u engage. It's very tempting to hit Q and go in but rather just W in to close the distance and AA them. If they run u have Q to dive in for the kill on the runners."

NexusNewbies,3awazs,rhinoseverywhere,5,Wed Jun 24 00:45:00 2015 UTC,"No hero is a must pick.  Sylvanas is awesome on Haunted Mines -if left alone-. Lost Vikings are awesome in Dragonshire -if not harassed-. If they're going 4v5 on Haunted Mines, go 4v4 and have someone punish Sylvanas over and over, especially if she goes full siege build.  It's not just about how to take advantage of certain heroes, but playing them enough so you can play against them. If you get Sylvanas, you can counter her."
NexusNewbies,3awazs,kirolm,5,Wed Jun 24 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"Well she is incredibly strong on haunted mines, but she is soo squishy. If you can't play her well then don't buy her due to the importance of positioning and low hp pool."
NexusNewbies,3awazs,sStarz1779,4,Wed Jun 24 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"She is very good on haunted mines but still has a worse winrate than bw or anub on this map. You don't need to have her if you are not good with her. If people rage because you don't first pick Sylv on HM they are wrong, a good sylv is obviously very powerful but a mediocre one won't do much. It's always better to take a hero you're good at."
NexusNewbies,3awazs,henrax,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, i have to be ""that guy"" here, Sylvanas is in fact a must have for Hero league, its one of the most consistent damage dealers in the current meta, she scales pretty well, is really mobile and her trait and heroic are stupidly powerfull used correctly. Shes just good overall on all situations and almost any composition.  Beeing completely realistic, you are somewhat hindering your team by not getting her first on Mines, and the higher the level of play the more you'll notice you need the wailing arrow.  Ofc, its actually more important to be good with a hero than to use a good hero, but in a vaccum, not considering skill level and only raw hero power, Sylvanas is one of the best heroes right now"
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,la_boomstick,5,Tue Jun 23 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, you should be leveling up every free hero to level 5; that gives you a bonus of 500 gold (plus however much gold you earned per game). It should take you three to five games. If, after playing five games with that hero, you're still not having fun with it, move on.  There's been heroes that I leveled to 5 and thought, ""Meh... just not for me."" And other heroes that I played one game and purchased immediately."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,HaiKarate,3,Tue Jun 23 14:43:18 2015 UTC,next patch will grant 750 gold at lv9 which is retroactive so ideally you level each hero to 9 now.

NexusNewbies,3au0zf,Pyroraptor,3,Tue Jun 23 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"If you like playing them but are not performing to your expectations then do some research, try some new builds, and try and find out why you are not using them as well. If, after that extra effort, you still can't get them down then move on to a someone else."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,polakovoador,3,Tue Jun 23 17:15:53 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  I've been watching pro games on how they perform on those champions I play and I guess maybe it isn't actually the best thing to emulate since they have actual compositions to back them up. Playing QM and not having healers (or at least having like a Tassadar or Tyrande vs an Uther) isn't exactly the best time to start diving in with Illidan.
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,gommerthus,3,Tue Jun 23 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"Besides watching pro games, watch MFPallytime. He plays soloqueue quickmatch, so it's all the crazy comps and lack of coordination you can expect to find."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,gommerthus,3,Tue Jun 23 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"This is something that a coworker of mine mentioned too.  He comes from a League of Legends background, and dislikes Heroes of the Storm, because he can't ""farm by himself"" and snowball by himself and suddenly become an unstoppable monster.  He said ""it just seems like in hots, everyone just pushes middle and that's it"".  Now when you see that type of comment, you can probably immediately guess what kind of level this player is.  I pointed out to him that well...you shouldn't be just all by yourself really, in any MOBA, all game long right?  For his comment ""everyone just pushes mid"" well - his team was all spread out and there was no communication to speak of, so no surprise his team loses.  But anyways due to the way the XP is spread out evenly across all the team members, IMO it emphasizes the team, over the individual."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,just_liv_a_little,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"I get what your coworker is coming from. However, in LoL I wasn't the ""carry"" type of player which is kind of an oxymoron when youre dealing with an AD player such as myself. I fashioned myself more as a supportive AD who let others carry and I would assist where I could so there's not really a me against the world mentality here.  I do kinda agree with his sentiments that everyone seemingly isn't playing for xp soak/objectives and more on just getting into fights at mid. If I was a mechanically better player, I'd play Abathur or TLV just so I could soak more and ""win"" via xp but unfortunately, I'm not.  However, if you're thinking that I'm at the same level as your coworker, I'd hope that I'm not. If Hotslogs is to be believed, my MMR is hovering around 2200 to 2400 (61 games played). Clearly I still have tons of things to learn in this game and I don't think I'm at my peak yet but I do hope I'm approaching the game with a better mentality than your friend."

The fact that you're asking questions, seeking insight and also sounding like you're already fully experienced and immersed in the genre speaks greater where, in my friend's case, he only plays where he can, and likes to ""show off"" in these variations of LoL games where you have a smaller party of 3, and would pick Diana to show everyone how awesome he is at the game.  But in truth when it comes to a ""real"" game, he does the strangest things, like try to gank with Talric while we're doing bottom lane."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,ItsNeu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say that if and when you decide to play HL, you have to be able to play all roles. Sure, you can tell your team mates to leave a specific role to you but so often, people pick what they like and the more versatile players pick around the selected composition, and if the situation comes down to you having last pick and you can only play as an assassin for example, but your team needs a support, it will be very tough for your team.  My suggestion is to practise with 1 hero from every role. Master them and understand the best builds for them by watching hero tutorials. Soon enough, you'll find your favourite support, warrior, assassin and specialist. Once you've found them, go on to discover your second favourite heroes for those roles. You'll need to be prepared for when your favourite hero gets picked by someone else.  About how to up your win rate for heroes. Number 1: Know what each hero role does. How they should be positioned in team fights. Know your priorities as the hero of that role. e.g. Never initiate fights if you're not a warrior unless you're baiting them and your team is nearby, ready to gank.   Number 2: Pick the right build. This is partly a repetition of what I've written - to understand your hero by watching tutorials. You cannot afford to just pick a talent that sounds good to you. These builds are used by pro players for a reason. You can deviate a little depending on the situation but usually, these builds are effective.   Number 3: Know how the opponents' heroes act. You need to understand what sort of abilities they have in order for you to take advantage of their cooldowns, bad positioning and weaknesses.  Of course, there are a number of things you need to learn up about the basics of laning, capturing mercs, backing your team and so on.  I hope I managed to shed some light on this awesome game! Good luck!"
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,Epicthunder25,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"I have actually at least 2 heroes for each role that I'm relatively proficient in. I own 25 heroes so I'm not lacking in choice but I guess I'm lacking mostly in proficiency with these assassin heroes. However, I will say that i do need more practice with some of the other roles since i've been so assassin based for quite some time.  I've basically based all my talent choices from pro games and looked closely at their map movements, positioning and target selections during teamfights and tried to emulate that. However, I'm now thinking that it might not be the best choice to do in QMs just because I might not have a team to back me up."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,MitruMesre,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"Well before i give up on a hero i try a few other popular builds incase its down to the talents ive selected and if that doesnt work i move on to another hero, at least then i understand more about the hero for when i face it in the nexus."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,hlxino,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:20:07 2015 UTC,"In personal experience I never ever seem to do good until i hit character level 5 with them, could just be me but I think 5 was set up as that learning curve for matches played for heroes.   The heroes are pretty unique to themselves blizzard has done a great job at not making duplicates so I think it's just adaption over who you are also playing against as well since you're most likely not playing the same people as you did when you first started playing (skill wise).  All I can really say is you should play them all to level 5 and trust me there will be some that you just won't want to go back to and some that you are meh and some that you will love.  Just look for guides there is a ton of guides and personally I don't think their is any cookie cutter build for any one hero it just depends on your preference. As in if you failed that badly to get synergy with a comp you were plaiyng with switch up the talents again or your opponents builds were just countering to yours to hard (which is more likely of the case) and the third reason is you probably just don't have enough experience the specific hero so just pick em up and keep playing.  GoodLuck HaveFun :)"
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,MilkTaoist,2,Tue Jun 23 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, the heroes I've mentioned above I've already at least gotten 3-5 games on (and thereby getting level 5 on each of them). However, maybe I'm just not respecting the learning curve for each of them and just incorrectly assuming that I'm not any good with them because I played a few games with them without having all the talents unlocked.  I'll definitely do more in terms of adapting my builds. Aside from emulating pro game builds, I also have the LoL AD mentality where like 75% of the builds are basically the same so I don't ever actually need to make alterations for the most part unless there is some differentiating circumstances that require such a change."

You should try Kerrigan, in the early game she is best for laning and getting some XP, but in the late game she can 1v1 almost anyone."
NexusNewbies,3au0zf,clenchedbuttocks,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"I will try her out. Thanks for the suggestion.  I've been staying away from her just because I already have a couple of melee assassins that I wanted to try to improve with (Zeratul and Illidan) but as I've mentioned above, I haven't gotten the results I've wanted so far. Well, not in terms of numbers, but in terms of wins.  However, looking at her kit a little more makes me interested in what she could bring to the table."

NexusNewbies,3ati1p,egoslam,2,Tue Jun 23 16:41:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. They games are only like 20 mins long. Just stick it out. You never know what happens. At one point we were down something like 21 to 7 kills and a three level deficit. Pulled it out in the end though. I really wish there was a way to see the opposing team chat though. Seeing how excited we got at the end I'd like to see their panic and anger knowing it was over.
NexusNewbies,3ati1p,N8CCRG,2,Tue Jun 23 16:58:59 2015 UTC,The other day I had someone ready to call gg when we were only level 7 to their 8 and they'd gotten one round of whatever the objective was. This is why there shouldn't be a surrender button.

I actually just got out of a qm where one of our players was constantly shit talking us even though we won and he did the worst across the board on our team.

NexusNewbies,3at3ro,dooblevay,0,Tue Jun 23 21:35:23 2015 UTC,In HotS allied chat is by default turned off afaik. So the community is going to obviously split into three different groups. 1. Those who use chat and turn it on. 2. Those who don't use chat and leave it off and 3. Those who don't know how to turn it on.  Group 3 is going to be far more common in the lower levels. I'm part of group 2 myself. I don't think chat adds anything good to an ongoing game so I leave it off.
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,landerwi,2,Tue Jun 23 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"Uther and Brightwing are top tiers. Slight nerf to BW from the PTR notes (can't remb what) but she/it(??) will still be solid. Rehgar is also good for clutch heals.  Uther is the tanky dude who can go infront, throw a stun and take a beating and poke enemies while heal is on cooldown. He's decent from early game to end game.  BW is a strong partner with anyone early game, and can push for ganks due to Polymorph/Teleport(instead of mounting). All in all a very strong lane presence with a partner and can be anywhere on the map.  Rehgar is alil middle of the pack. Okay-ish heals with a clutch saving heroic that can turn team fights in ur favor. Gets better after lvl 10. Starts out alil weak imo.  Malfurion only has 1 heal, and I don't play him much. Never tried Tyrande/Tassadar so idk.  Edit: New patch has no new supports. Monk is like over a month away"

NexusNewbies,3av0fu,spiderguy22,2,Tue Jun 23 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"I'll chime in about the remaining Heroes and some other random thoughts.   Malfurion is fairly solid with the right build and provides alot of utility (scouting drone, healing ward, protective shield, shrink ray, storm shield) in matches. Plus that innervate can help with early fights. Later in games he can spec in Life Seed which allows him autocast regrowth on nearby heroes. Tranquility is a fight changer when used right. He has a shorter cooldown on his heal which means he can toss it out more unlike Uther which is one big one and done. Only downside is when people are being focused fire on his heal can be negated fairly quickly...  Tyrande and Tassadar fall into a similar category of ""support"" but really they are more of an off support that can put out considerable damage. If you draft and that is the ""support"" for the team people will be upset most likely. You can spec Tyrande into a healer but I haven't done it in awhile.   LiLi hasnt been mentioned is actually fairly solid as well. She puts out decent damage and heals especially later in the game.  IMO for Heals it goes  Brightwing Uther Rhegar Malf LiLi  Tassadar is still a good support pick just make sure there is a healer on team. In fact Tassadar is wanted by many comps just for his damage, sight, shields.   Last note is as always with any comp and communication with team I think all the healers are viable in the hands of practiced player and even some of the pro teams were using Malf this past weekend."
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,spiderguy22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:38:53 2015 UTC,This past weekend I think Tempo used Malf and his MULE talent to stall a game out and eventually win just to add to his potential and amazing utility.
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,RogueT3ch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:41:40 2015 UTC,"I agree here. My first support was BW and I regretted it for a day or so until I started to get better with her. She is definitely top tier. Aside from Uther, I'd recommend Rehgar or Tassadar. You'll want to have 2 or 3  supports though for HL, but starting early with BW is a good idea cause she takes a lot of time to get good at."
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,Bstodds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:41:51 2015 UTC,I have found Brightwing the overall best and most enjoyable hero. Obviously hero preferences are very unique to the individual player but since you asked for a recommendation... Brightwing has the ability to make big impact plays in team fights. Polymorph is a great CC that can turn big team fights and there is versatility amongst talent choices that keep Brightwing interesting. I would try the supports available free to play each week and determine which one you find suits your play style and go for it!
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,Eriennyl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:29:42 2015 UTC,just done reading ptr notes .. polymorph duration reduced and no longer do dmg on application .. :(
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,MilkTaoist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"Li Li is cheap and probably the easiest support to play, but the parts of her kit that make her easy also make her not as good for a more skilled player, particularly her heal's untargetability. She may be getting a little better in the patch, with the changes to blinds and the introduction of daze. She's also on the free rotation right now, so it's a good time to give her a shot.  If you use pro play as a metric, currently Brightwing and Uther are regarded as the strongest supports, but BW has a long list of changes on the PTR so that may change. Rehgar and Malfurion are good choices as well, Li Li seldomly pops up, though she's probably fine to play unless you're a top-tier player - it's just rough not being able to give your heal to a priority target. Tyrande and Tassadar are labeled support in game, however they don't see much play as supports - they don't heal a team very well, and they lack defensive ultimates."
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,HaiKarate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:23:07 2015 UTC,"Li Li is probably my favorite healer to play when I'm on a good team (if I'm on a bad team, it doesn't matter which healer I have!). More than a few times I've turned the tide of a 5v5 skirmish with my 1,000 Cups ability... just gotta watch out for the enemy heroes with the interrupts."
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,HaiKarate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"Ten Ton Hammer has a nice list of HotS heroes ranked by tier. But if you don't feel comfortable playing one of the Tier 1 heroes, it won't matter that they're Tier 1.  My recommendation is that you buy the ones you have the most fun with and feel most comfortable with."
NexusNewbies,3av0fu,cm512,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:58:49 2015 UTC,Lili is not a top tier hero as previously mentioned but I think she is the ideal support trainer.  Since you do not target heals you can focus on positioning which is critical for healers.  She is also versatile in that can you spec her for damage with the popular serpent build.  Its a nice alternative if the comp allows for it.
NexusNewbies,3ataps,smekarn85,4,Tue Jun 23 09:49:25 2015 UTC,"Hi there, from my experience (see below for a tl;dr version of each point):   Ignoring a lane is a big no-no. It could work if you manage to kill every other player in the game and then head back, but the amount of XP you lose from leaving nobody in a lane is way more than you'd expect. The only time you want to consider leaving a lane empty is for a major objective (example: contesting a Tribute, especially when you or the enemy has 2/3) or when your own lane opponent leaves to gank (even then, if you can warn your teammates and make sure they don't die, you can stay and soak to get an XP lead over your opponents). In short: soaking in all 3 lanes early is paramount to make sure you don't fall behind. I'm not sure on this, but I believe you have to be within a certain proximity of a minion death or cause the minion's death. This means if you W a minion wave and walk away, then it dies, you get no XP if you're out of range. I have a pretty terrible sleep schedule, so I don't catch streamers that are on prior to 5PM-ish EST, but I really enjoy watching chu8 and Kaeyoh whenever I catch them streaming. You can find them at http://www.twitch.tv/chu8 and http://www.twitch.tv/kaeyoh. chu8 is a streamer only but he streams for very long periods of times (usually ~10PM EST till ~7AM EST, give or take an hour on each end). Kaeyoh is on Tempo Storm, a professional team who is known as one of the top 2 teams in NA (they recently won the North American June Qualifier for the Road to Blizzcon) I've learnt a lot about team compositions from watching streams and playing a ton of games. You start to naturally get a grasp of what works and what doesn't (i.e. double support works really well, no support is disasterous, only having tassadar as a support is terrible, stuff like that). Aside from that, there was recently a post on the main HotS reddit  with a link to a really in-depth and informative post on TeamLiquid (here: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/heroes/485714-hero-league-101). You can also see the reddit post here (some more tl;dr info for HL): http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3apsf5/how_i_messed_up_my_mmr_in_hero_league_and_am_now/   tl;dr version   99.9% of the time flat out ignoring a lane is really bad. Only under circumstances should you leave a lane alone, like contesting a major objective or helping a large teamfight that could let the enemy get a larger XP lead than just leaving your lane. XP is given by proximity or killing the minion, 'tagging' it with damage then leaving does not work afaik chu8 and Kaeyoh from my experience, but I don't watch streams prior to around 5PM EST so I don't know if others are prior to that Play, watch streams, get a grasp of what fails and what works. You can also look here for an informative post on TL: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/heroes/485714-hero-league-101"

NexusNewbies,3ataps,I_AM_A_UNIT,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:48:04 2015 UTC,Another question regarding camps!   When should I be including killing them? I know that when you get into mid and late game you roam a lot in a group and picking camps on the way is pretty mandatory.  I'm just wondering at which point in time can I start looking to securing camps? Pre-10 and/or post-10..  I understand there are abilities (bribe) and certain heroes (Sonya) that makes it easier.
NexusNewbies,3ataps,HaiKarate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been looking into myself too. It's generally ok to take mercenaries whenever you can (especially enemy mercenaries, but make sure they can't contest or it could turn around quickly) but if you can time the mercenaries when an objective will spawn, that's the best. For example: on Sky Temple, you want to take bruisers at 4:40 so they push top while the bot temple is active. For Haunted Mines, delay the cap of the siege camp until the enemy golem is at your gate. This will allow it to safely help you kill the enemy golem. Stuff like that is important to making sure the camps aren't wasted. Bribe is pretty good for ninja'ing enemy siege camps but more often than not doing that just wastes the siege camp so use it as you will (I enjoy using it, but it's really just a deny not really a steal in most cases)."

This means if you W a minion wave and walk away, then it dies, you get no XP if you're out of range.   I believe that's right. XP is only disbursed when you're within proximity of a death or a building destruction. It doesn't matter if you participated or not, and no XP is given for simply attacking without a kill.  This is where team grouping is really powerful. If all five together are mowing down Forts and Towers, the building destruction XP is multiplied per hero in proximity."
NexusNewbies,3ataps,hacdladf1,3,Tue Jun 23 14:38:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure XP never gets multiplied by the amount of heroes nearby nor is it necessary to be near buildings when they get destroyed to get the XP.

NexusNewbies,3ataps,topher78714,2,Wed Jun 24 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's important to have at least one hero per lane so you don't miss any xp (unless you can rotate effectively but it's clearly a more advanced level). SO you can have up to 2 heroes doing some ganking. Of course if you have Nova, don't even try to lane, you should be roaming at all times. Zera and Kerrigan are very effective also, and basically anyone with some burst damage. You have to last-hit them or be near them when they die. I'm completely in love with chu8. He is insanely good, funny and clear in his explanation. Grubby is also very good imo. Both of them do almost only solo Q, use a lot of different heroes and explain very well (they don't look like they are too focused on the game and don't really think about what they say). The right side-bar is a good start ;)"

It really depends on your playstyle, what character you pick, your talents, your team comp, and the map. What character(s) have you played and had fun with? Have you gone to the shop and fooled around with trying out characters? Or just used the weekly free ones?   If/when your team is behind, the easiest answer is just to group up and push together. Communication is key, and if you're too busy to type, try using the ""g"" pinging thing. I've been playing around with it in AI so I don't annoy more serious players, but it's really useful for quick communication.   I'm not sure on everyone, but I like being a support. I'm not too great at dealing damage, as a lot of the bursty dps have to line up their attacks, and position better, and I'm not good at that just yet. I like lili, to help keep teammates up and sylvanas, who can lane and push towers alone. (though team fights she's not too great).  As for what to learn? I'd say play around with all of them in the shop, try out talents and attacks to see what characters bring. You can learn when to just run or when to slam hard once someone uses all their cooldowns and they're just a punching bag trying to run away. You can learn to counter and avoid stuff by learning at least the basics about other characters and their cds, so I'd say that's your best bet, if you want to play competitively!"

NexusNewbies,3atpj7,andraes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"Malfurion and Li Li are two very good supports.  The other top heroes in that class are Uther, Brightwing and Rehgar.

They play differently though as Uther is naturally very tanky so don't be afraid to always stay in the back, as u have a stun too.  BW starts off as a very strong lane partner due to her trait, and can find early ganks with a ganking partner."
NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,HaiKarate,8,Mon Jun 22 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"When I started in HL, I found it a real mess compared to QM. My understanding is, at least at present, your HL MMR is separate from your QM MMR. I had some really bizarre HL games until maybe my 10th game or so. One possibility is that you just had really tough luck getting your MMR sorted out. So many factors are involved.  Streaks happen -- both winning and losing. If you lose more than three or four games in a row in a short time period, it's probably time for a break and an analysis of what has happened. I would say first step is to rethink the drafts you saw: Did you pick a bad Hero for your comp? Did your team get Gaz, Stitches, Murky, Aba, and ETC? If you didn't have a series of bad drafts, look at your replays. Did your team soak appropriately every game? Did your team avoid early feeds? Did you shutdown a split-pushing Azmodan? Were you ahead two levels until you lost a teamfight during a boss pull?  Try to figure out what the primary cause of each loss was beyond just, ""Our support really sucked."" If you notice a trend -- you always have bad drafts or your teams are not soaking to 10 right -- then approach HL differently. (""All my teammates suck"" is not a trend! You need to have information you can improve with.) On draft screen, say hi and ask what the plan is. Pick a Hero you're comfortable with rather than one that is flavor of the month. On the draft screen, if you see the opponents take Illidan, ask if your team has a good BW or Uther. If someone on your team blind picks Aba, ask if anyone plays a good Illidan. Did the other team take Nova? Get Rehgar or Uther for Farsight/Clairvoyance. Rather than just going for ""tier one"" Heroes, think about how your team's Heroes mesh and how they counter the other team's.  Approach it like a flowchart. If your problem isn't in draft, see if it's in game. What decisions are your team making? Do you play with people always rushing the boss? Do they tunnelvision objectives when it's better to let one Tribute slide so you can soak? Did you run to the Tribute too early and die before your team could get there? If you start noticing what is going wrong in your games, you can better stop it in games going forward. You'll know what to look for. While it's true that five people doing a dumb thing is better than four people doing a dumb thing while you do a smart thing, it's also true that you can quickly type ""don't pull their boss - even levels, 5v5, we will get ganked,"" or some variation, if that has cost you two games already and people are trying to do it a third time. More often than not, people will listen.  I notice in your post you talk about your own ability -- the builds you use, your understanding of mechanics, how you fit into a team -- but Heroes relies just as much, if not more, on team cohesion, at least in my experience. You need to be communicating. If you watch your seven losses and see that no one ever said anything useful in any of those games, that might be your single biggest problem. It's okay to talk. Talk at the start, during the lane phase, late game, whenever you think someone's gotta call the shots, because most people don't. You can play the perfect Kael build, but a team that isn't gelling isn't going to be saved by Living Bomb. You gotta have both the skill and awareness as well as the team cohesion.   If you go through your drafts and your seven losses, I guarantee you will learn a ton, especially about what you can improve on. Blame on the matchmaking system, poor teammates, etc., is very common in any game that is competitive and requires team play. I know you aren't doing this, but just keep with the mindset that you can always improve, that most people you play with want to succeed and have fun, and that it's time to take a break if you meet your predetermined max number of losses (if I lose three in a row, I'm out for the night)."

If it's people doing it at start on a map like BB or Sky Temple, I'd just say at the start of the match to avoid a fight on it to get ahead on XP/levels. Otherwise, decide if you think your team comp can win a level 1 fight. If so, go help. If not, tell them you're going to soak. That last part puts the choice in their hands -- get useful XP, or dick around at a watchtower."

NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,wanderlustcub,7,Mon Jun 22 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"Agree with that last sentiment. Most of my good heroes were already taken and I was picking 10th. I somehow at Rank 43, got matched up with Rank 6 and 7s. I asked if it was cool to play Gaz, and my team just went ""GG"" (like we're going to lose).   We MURDERED them, partly because I know Gaz the best out of any character. If you have to choose between a hero you're a monster at, and a ""Tier 1"" hero, pick the one you're good at. Don't let naysayers get to you (turn off team chat if need be). And most importantly, play your best and learn as much as you can."

NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,madrounds,5,Tue Jun 23 10:19:35 2015 UTC,"I also found it helpful to at least take the meta heroes that are dominating and spam some of them in QM just to try and get a step up. If heroes like anub are murdering in win rate and you have the gold to get them maybe try spamming them in QM to see if you like them. I agree play who you are best at whether ""tier 1"" or not, but it doesn't hurt to try and keep with the meta champs and get decent at them to take advantage at where they're at for that patch. I spammed stitches until he got nerfed into oblivion then moved on to the next power champs. People tilt so easily in games that I try and do my part to pacify them by getting comfortable with meta champs and staying positive in games.

Other than that game though I have been pretty lucky. The main issue I am seeing in HL is players who take XP soak WAY WAY too seriously and don't know the mechanics of when to pull away to team fight. They also don't want to hear any advice on it. :(  OP or anyone else, feel free to add me if you want to play sometime - LBCoupeGT#1961"
NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,gommerthus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah on my first HL game I noticed something too.  I wish, when the opposing the team locks in the character you had in mind, a big red ""X"" appears on your side's box(to tell you, that you can't have that character anymore, because the other side took it).  That would have saved a lot of grief and even a panicked re-pick because someone didn't notice it in time.  Another thing about this ""XP soak"" business.  This game is not League of Legends...but yet The Lost Vikings have one of their number sit there in the beginning of the game to ""soak"" near the turret.  So I need to understand something.  Is this soaking as important as some make it out to be?  Or is it honestly seriously overblown?  How important is it, that people stick to their lanes?  And what is the support person supposed to do?  Always stick with a partner, or take a lane?"
NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,CozyHeartPenguin,2,Tue Jun 23 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"My thoughts might not be the best, but I focus on teamwork more than ""stick to lane."" My main issue is when someone uses ""Gotta soak lane XP"" as a reason to stay out of a full blow 5v5 team fight or to ignore things like shrines, tributes or seed collection. Here are the issues:   The entire enemy team is in a single lane, so there is no losing XP in comparison to the enemy team (unless like you mention they have a trick like Vikings). Enemy kills are worth much more XP than a couple minions. Someone picking up a few minion kills and leaving the the team down one in a team fight means that they are basically giving the enemy team a higher opportunity of coming out on top. So this means your team loses big XP opportunities and the other team will get big gains. Both are much more significant than the XP from minions. I feel the same about this when someone clears a wave of minions instead of focusing on a map's main mechanic. Typically something like holding a shrine or collecting seeds is going to much more XP than a few more minions. Towers and forts give you big XP boosts and holding both shrines or having a plant spawn is going to take them out way more quickly.   Obviously these things don't apply in every single moment of the game and you have to know what is more important in the end. Overall though, there are too many people who take the VS AI game play and bring it to QM and HL and think they are doing things right.  I watch MFPallytime mostly to figure out more about the game. He releases a video pretty much every day and explains a lot through the match. https://www.youtube.com/user/MFPallytime"
NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,puttybutty,2,Tue Jun 23 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"I think you should avoid using guides. In my opinion, everyone has a different play style. So if you use a guide, it might pull you out of your play style and (maybe?) confuse you during team fights or objectives. You should experiment with your heroes and talents and see what fits your play style.   For example: Maybe you read a Nova guide that said ""Nova's Snipe is love. Nova's Snipe is life."" and it revolved around bursting heroes down with Snipe; but your play style is like deceiving enemies and dealing damage while slowing or stunning. Then you wouldn't necessarily follow the guide and build around her clone and pinning shot ability.  Also, build to counter your opponents' builds/play style.  Are they being too aggressive with no sustain/defense? Then go for that Snipe, Cloaked move speed, and 2nd clone. Make them use all of their abilities on 2 clones while you run behind them all and shove a sniper bullet up their flaming assholes."
NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,ReKaYaKeR,2,Tue Jun 23 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"This.   Moreso, you won't really get good experience and you will never be able to adapt if you keep following cookie cutter guides.   It's not a bad thing to start out with, but you definitely need to think on your own. Just look at the options, consider the benefits and such, and think about how they would be useful or hinder you.  This will make you a better player and give you higher awareness for enemy builds.    Also, this advice ties in. Comps are extremely important. If you go in thinking you want to play Nova, that's great. However, you HAVE to consider your team, as well as the enemy team. Even if you want to play someone, always go for the person that is better suited for your comp. Sure some people can get to rank 1 playing 1 hero, but you aren't them. No offense. Disclaimer: Don't play someone that you are not familiar with because they are strong with your comp. My above advice does not apply if you aren't moderately comfortable with the hero.   Hope this helps, GLHF!"

The two examples I can think of are Brightwing's Blink ability (which I had neglected) and Anub'arak's beetle line (which I had grossly neglected)."

In the end, you're still following a guide that would make the most sense or that you agree with.   There are so many different combinations of talents that you can get. Most of them won't be in guides. Just the 1 or 2 that some popular streamer/youtuber is using.

NexusNewbies,3aqyjg,zonine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"The thing turned my HL game around completely was realizing the need to communicate.  Communicate, communicate, communicate.  As soon as the draft screen pops up, start at least with a ""hello,"" it starts people talking. This is good because people tend to not be good at respecting the draft when choosing characters - if they're already talking it gives you an opening to go ""hey, make sure someone grabs a healer and a tank"" ""I'm last so I can fill"" ""XYZ is really good for this map if someone can grab that"" ""Hey person, could you grab X to counter their hero?"" Things like that.  Carry it over into the game. Always ping where you're going and let people know where they should be going. People hate being told what to do so the approach I find useful is (for example) ""Mines soon, back off and heal up"" or ""Tribute coming up, let's all get here so we can contest."" Also, if you notice that someone is pushed forward too far, ping the FUCK out of the danger ping. People will typically respect it and back off."

Sure, the higher tier can sometimes mean the hero is overpowered and it's very easy to be good with them, but up until you're the best of the best you can be competitive at your skill level with any hero. Also the top tier heroes might require exceptional teamwork for them to be good and generally most people don't have that.  You always want to be good at different roles, so Zeratul is good since you already have some experience at ranged assassins. Zeratul also has a built in escape from level 1 so he's a lot easier to survive with. Nova is better at picking off lone out of position heroes, but Zeratul has a much larger impact in team fights.

This was quick, and great. I loved the notation.  I'm a newbie, so maybe it's standard, but 3441,233 was really straight-forward.  What's the , signify? Is it just after the level 10 Ult? I loved the variation(s).  Need a stun?  Take this.  Need an escape?  Take this.   I would have liked a 2 sentence summary of the build.  I understand that 30s of the video was explaining the notation, but a quick ""Valla is a ranged DPS, and this build maximizes her auto-attack damage for players with good positioning: 3441,233.  If you are new, and get hit more than you want to, taking 2332,233 will give you a big more survivability - but remember, you are a squishy ranged dps, no matter the build.""

It seems that if you make a couple mistakes in a row you can expect to see ""omg worst <heroname> ever."" or something to that effect. Rarely do I see actually helpful advice when I make mistakes. I try to tell them to chill and give me advice and that advice usually ends up being some smart ass remark that isn't helpful at all."

I can't see how it's possible to play the game correctly when you spend so much time insulting instead of strategizing.   I feel like people forget it's a team effort and having an effective team is necessary more than 1 or 2 strong players. A good team helps cover the negatives in order to secure victory.   Ever since it left beta, I've seen more disrespect and more XP mining, which is super frustrating."

And my favorite is is had one game where an azmodan and sylvanas kept pushing lanes (different lanes mind you) no matter what else was going on such as objectives or team fights.

NexusNewbies,3arsz6,Hiroxis,3,Tue Jun 23 00:20:54 2015 UTC,"You should definitely choose depending on your team comp and the enemies team comp.  Personally I never take Life Drain, because Unstable Poison is just too good for pushing, and I usually don't need the sustain that much.  If you wanna focus an pushing and you feel like you can survive without the movement speed from Evasive Fire, then Splinter Shot is a good alternative. It provides a decent amount of extra AoE damage.  At 16 if you have a heavy team fight comp, take Cold Embrace. The 25% extra damage on the enemy team is massive, and makes a huge difference in fights. But if the enemy team has a heavy dive comp (e.g. Tyrael, Illidan etc.), and you have trouble surviving, then you should take Blood for Blood. Also if you prefer split pushing, Blood for Blood is often better, as the damage and health helps you to either survive or win a duel."

NexusNewbies,3aqosf,HaiKarate,2,Mon Jun 22 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"That's my problem with Valla; I always want to Rambo with her, and use my sprint to chase rather than save it to run away. And as soon as I do, two more enemy heroes pop out and kill me. :("
NexusNewbies,3aqosf,Brrackis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of people chase waaaaaay too much. The best thing to do with valla is to hold off on chasing, or blowing cd's (sprint or vault) until you know that someone a little more beefy is gonna be in on the chase, or just don't chase at all and go push or objective.  The biggest problem for me is knowing when to strafe, and having mana (I do the hugering arrow hits more targets with the vault refreshes hugering arrow cd, sooooo good against someone who's away from minions)."
NexusNewbies,3aqosf,Hiroxis,3,Mon Jun 22 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"Are you using the auto-attack build or the Multishot Build?   For the auto attack build, Rain of Vengeance is a lot better, because you can't AA while strafing, and having the CC and extra peel for yourself.  For the Multishot build, you should almost always do Multishot, then Hungering Arrow then Strafe. If you Strafe while the other two are off cooldown you lose damage. Also the slow from Multishot helps you stay in range.  Another thing with Valla is that you should almost never use Vault offensively. You are better off staying in the back and hitting the tanks, than you are jumping in and attacking the carries. The only times you should use it offensively is if you are certain that you can get the kill and not die.   Valla is a sitting duck without Vault, and you will get blown up instantly if you are out of position, and Vault is on CD"
NexusNewbies,3aqosf,Brrackis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"I do a mix of hungering and multishot, I never build AA builds, especially on valla cause I like her skill set too much to just right click to victory. Usually I'll go hungering arrow, vault, hungering arrow, multishot and start my strafe. Using vault offensively is good with the setup I use, you just can't use it like a retard, I.E. I vault to get my second hungering arrow out as fast as possible once the fight starts, but never vaulting towards anyone. Vault towards someone and you're most likely going to die."
NexusNewbies,3aqosf,jorrod,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:23:49 2015 UTC,Getting multishot at level 1 is pretty helpful. I love using vault offensively too. This is the build I usually follow: http://game-brain.com/heroes-of-the-storm/valla-guide/

NexusNewbies,3apszd,UncleSlim,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"LoL player of a couple years here, Heroes player since early alpha.  Your favorite champs vary wildly in style so I would recommend just trying out different heroes to get a feel for which you're comfortable with.  Some comparisons:  Graves - Try Valla. They're both attack damage carries based off of a solid auto attack and some good abilities. Valla's vault is comparable to Graves' dash move. Raynor is also similar in style.  Rengar - Try Zeratul or Illidan. Rengar's stealthy burst assassin type is pretty similar to zeratul's playstyle. Illidan is another melee assassin with a lot of punch.  Thresh - Try Stitches or Johanna. Thresh is a huge utility CC support and there really isn't a hero in the game like that. Stitches and Johanna are both tanks but have good CC. Stitches has a hook more like blitzcranks pull, but its a hook if that's what you're looking for. Johanna is an unkillable CC machine.  Hope this helps!"
NexusNewbies,3apszd,UncleSlim,2,Mon Jun 22 16:47:05 2015 UTC,Thanks! I tried Raynor and Zeratul both are not too far off from what i like! I think the first hero im going to buy will be zeratul
NexusNewbies,3apszd,Psysaturn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"To answer your meta question, Zeratul is pretty good. Raynor has seen better days, but there are very few champs that are considered ""trash tier"". Gazlowe is notorious for being weak at the moment."

NexusNewbies,3apwk4,Maestro_Da_Vinci,5,Mon Jun 22 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"1) not sure what you are asking here. Can you try stating in a different way?  2)you can see what heroes you own (or are on free to play rotation) by looking at the character select screen when you go to play a game. Click play at the top, then click the hero in the middle of the screen.  That will bring up hero select. The ones you own or are free to play will be in full color. The rest are greyed out.   3)the level of a hero outside of a game is shown in hero select. You gain levels for a hero by playing it.  During games you level up by killing minions, towers, etc.  You can see your team level (there are no individual levels) at the top of the screen.   4)you can use gold to buy heroes at any time (they are either 2000, 7000, 10000, or 15000 gold) or master level skins once you get a hero to level 20.   5)quests are things that you do to earn more gold such as winning three games. You get one a day and you can only hold three at a time. You can see what quests you have by clicking the ! icon at the bottom right hand corner of your menu screen.   6)I don't believe there is key mapping but I may be wrong. To figure out what keys to use are pretty simple. Q,W,E,R are typically your abilities, Z is mount, B is hearthstone, and 1234 are assigned if selecting an active talent during games.   7) the game is out, and the beta is complete. Anything you do now will stay, no more wipes.   Hope that helps. Have fun and play vs.AI games until you learn the basics."
NexusNewbies,3apwk4,topher78714,2,Mon Jun 22 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think for 1), he might be asking about how the tabs are set up at the start screen.  If so, the first screen (the HotS logo) is a brief summary of the newest character, people looking for parties or your own ability to look for a party by checking the box, your new quests, and so on.  The next tab, ""Play"", allows you to select a mode to play from those you have unlocked, as well as enter the character select screen as described above.  ""Shop"" allows you to browse heroes, skins, mounts, and bundles available for purchase with in-game currency or real money (something you can also accomplish from hero select).  The final tab, ""Watch"", allows you to watch replays of your matches, so long as you have those turned on in the options.  You can reach the options by clicking the gear icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.  Finally, on each tab you will also have access to the chat box in the bottom right, where you can chat to other players in channels you have automatically joined (such as general chat, or a party you're in), or those you join by typing the ""/join <channelname>"" command.  For 4), you are actually able to purchase a master skin at hero level 10 for 10,000 gold.  For 6), you can change your hotkeys by entering the options menu (the gear icon previously mentioned), and clicking ""Hotkeys"" at the very bottom of that screen."

The 1234- are things that i don't understand, during one of the games i had 1 active and was able to click it, but when i did i had mostly some kind of an icon with X on it meaning that i was inactive so i hope for some kind of key mapping."
NexusNewbies,3apwk4,topher78714,2,Mon Jun 22 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"You have to click to select the character from that screen.  If it has a gold/real money amount above it after it's selected and the hero model shows up in the center, you don't own it.  It's kind of obnoxious, but it works.  As for the ""X"" icon, that means you can't use the ability on that type of enemy.  For example, you can't use Blood for Blood on a mercenary or boss.

You click ""Play"" to play, click ""Store"" to go to the Store, and click ""Watch"" to watch your old games. The main menu is in the bottom right, which has options and such.  2) Click ""Play"" then click your character at the selection screen.  You can play all of the ones that are not greyed out (darker). The ones with the blue logo next to them are the free ones. The other light ones are the ones you own.  3) You level up each character by playing them and you level up yourself by playing. If you right click your avatar in the top right corner you can select your own profile. It will tell you your level and the levels of each hero.  4) You get gold from playing games and completing daily quests. Here is a good guide to amounts of gold.  5) You have up to 3 daily quests. The quest button is the exclaimation button in the bottom right of the main menu.  6) This game has fully customizable key mapping. Click the menu button in the bottom right of the screen. Then click Options. You can click Hotkeys and then Advanced to get a list of every button by type.   7) Someone else will have to help you with this one. I think I know the answer, but don't want to give you wrong information.  I'm trying to do this all from memory since I don't have the game on this computer.

Newbie things to pay attention to are: -Is someone in your team in each lane in the early game? -Are objectives up, or about to be? -Where is enemy team in relation to your team? -How many people on each team are alive -What camps are up -Retreat pings when your team is outnumbered"

NexusNewbies,3an8ui,Lunkx,3,Mon Jun 22 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"Erik has very low health, so the Viking player will likely hide him in a bush close to the lane (or use the talent that makes him invisible).   That way, a seemingly ""empty"" lane actualy has a Viking character soaking XP."

You don't do much damage as a support, so healing yourself is much less effective than healing your tank/dps heroes. That being said, you'll never get a perfect team solo queueing in quick match/hero league. It's best to get a team of friends together and if possible, do voice chat."

NexusNewbies,3anp1e,micfijasan,2,Mon Jun 22 01:20:16 2015 UTC,"Some of your problems just happen in QM and Hero League. If there's no one to support before level 10, just farm (you'll hear the term ""soak"" more often) as best you can. If you're pushed back to your wall early, just stay safe, since you'll get the xp for minions that die to the towers. But the number one priority is making sure there is at least one person in each lane. After level 10, I would stop farming and actively seek out the rest of your team, since it becomes your job to try to keep your teammates alive. If they don't respond to your pings, do whatever they do instead. After level 10, the general advice goes along the lines of: it's better to be idiots as a group than smart by yourself.  Hope this helped in some way."

If your teammates are butts and don't respond to pings or help you out, go do what they're doing instead. You'll get it done faster, and safer with two of you, rather than getting ganked while by yourself. People who insist on soloing by themselves in lane, don't participate in teamfights, or objectives, will almost always be the weak link in your team.  It's a team game, if they team won't help you, swallow your pride and help the team. You're looking to win, not to be right."
NexusNewbies,3anp1e,polakovoador,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:31:34 2015 UTC,If there's a lane empty (which happens a lot in QM) it's more important to soak that lane (Even if you get pushed) compared to leave it empty and find a buddy. You should ask in chat for someone to relieve you so that you can be more helpful to the group though.
NexusNewbies,3alx38,scene_missing,9,Sun Jun 21 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"Your healing is more valuable than your damage, so stay back & use your abilities until you can attack safely. You should let the tank(s) go in first, and try to stay behind them. The best time for you to deal damage is when you have the numbers advantage (ex if you're 2v1ing a lane) or when someone gets out of position (ex if you're in a teamfight and an enemy gets behind your lines).  Basically, you want to avoid needing to use your healing ult on yourself, because it's much more valuable on one of your allies (esp. the tank, as the total healing will be greater on someone with more total hp). Usually, I focus on using my totem to catch people and then attack them, & you can set up a good pick-off on anyone that ends up behind your tank this way.  Also, pull off the attack whenever you're in a situation where the enemy can focus on you. If you're on the front line with your tank, your tank will take up a lot of the damage for you. If you're in front of the rest of your team, you'll be targeted first and you'll go down."
NexusNewbies,3alx38,Rkynick,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"It also depends a bit on your talent build. If you're the only support on the team it's generally a good idea to pick mostly healing talents and stay back like the other guy said. If you have another healer, then you can pick more aggressive talents and ""fight"" more, but still be careful about overextending."

NexusNewbies,3amlgp,_AbedNadir,4,Sun Jun 21 18:32:31 2015 UTC,Zagara would save you some cash and is a stronger pick in most comps. I would really give Sylvanas another shot she's a great fit for any comp.  Not saying Murky is bad... but it's more of an uphill battle to be truly competitive with him and at 10k there's better ways to spend your gold before buying him.  I would also point out that you haven't spent money on Murky yet - meaning you haven't fallen in love like other Murky players. Not a bad thing - but Murky is a character you play for the love of the character; not the team.
NexusNewbies,3amlgp,xaelra,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"Its not that I don't like her, I got her to 7, almost level 7 when she was in the free week rotation, but its just .... I prefer, I like heroes that can make stuff happen, you know? Can kill people and force team fights on their own, heroes that are right there in the action.   From all the specialist Murky is the only one who seem that way. Sylvanas is more of a shutting down the minion wave, turrets and farming camps. You leave your finger holding the Q key down .. and thats it you've done your job.  I don't ... maybe I'll end up buying her after all.

If you're not happy with Sylvanas, don't pick her up! That's why I suggested Zagara though. Different play style with the same push\team fighting abilities."
NexusNewbies,3amlgp,Snacksfan,2,Mon Jun 22 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"Murky is very good in the right hands and situation, his win rate exists as it does for a reason but I do not recommend him until you've fleshed out your roster a little. Lost Vikings, Abathur and Murky are heroes you purchase after you've got a really good grip on the game and a versatile roster.  If you want a good, more normal-esque Specialist that isn't Sylvanas, try out Zagara. I think you can get spare codes for her for like 2-3 bucks on key selling sites if you want to hang onto your gold."
NexusNewbies,3amlgp,rllebron200,3,Sun Jun 21 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite. I'm still technically a newb even though I'm level 26. Most characters I play are on the free hero roster. If I see what that interests me, I'll buy them and try them out. If I feel like I did okay with them the first time, but not comfortable with them, I'll look up videos to see how most people would play them and try the same things or something similar, especially for the harder difficulty characters.  Case in point, I really wanted to try out abathur and see what he was like so I bought him because I had the coinage for it. I played a game or two with him with my friends and I felt like I did okay even though we lost. I've looked at some videos on how to play him and now I can't wait to try him out again with the new strategies I learned by watching those videos."

It's probably better they pick a hero they're comfortable with anyway, than have some level 30 pick a tank cause you need one and they have no idea how to tank.

Those guides are also succinct, but with a different focus.  For brand new players (as I am, with just over 200 games in HotS, and this being my first MOBA), sometimes brevity is too exclusive."
NexusNewbies,3ajlz3,angrmgmt00,6,Mon Jun 22 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a deep dark pit of MMR in HL you don't want to get stuck in. You're already well on you way into it by losing your first few matches. You should try to play with a group of friends until you get to at least rank 35 or 40 because if someone has rank 40 to 50 that means they never do HL or they always lose. I got up to rank 18, but then had a rather nasty streak of afkers and feeders. I had a few decent matches during this streak, but my team ended up losing them. All the way up to rank 18 I had good matches, evenly balanced with teams being teams. Now when I solo queue I get teams that are so bad the compositions don't matter.   I always have to be the damage role because any other role I'll have to play as if I were the damage because my team's assassin or specialist is either going to be killed clearing minions (by the minions) post level 20 or soloing merc camps (usually the other team kills therm, sometimes the actual camp) while ignoring every type of ping and message in the book. Trust me and stop  queuing alone. Find people to play with. You might still lose, but you'll be saved the trouble of playing with the people I play with."
NexusNewbies,3ajlz3,hacdladf1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:03:19 2015 UTC,"What rank are you now? I also got into this pit, I think you get out of it once you play people who are brand new to HL. That means you're now back to where you started, only you wont advance as fast as the new people since the more games you play the slower your mmr movements."
NexusNewbies,3ajlz3,swartkrans,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:56:26 2015 UTC,"I'm 25 right now. You don't play people who are new, you play people who have been in it and have also fallen down to the level you are. Except most of them seem to actually belong there unfortunately."
NexusNewbies,3ajlz3,hacdladf1,4,Sun Jun 21 03:39:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who tried playing soloqueue on my own terms (I bring out new champions in HL pretty fast because I dislike QM for serious practice) I eventually became stuck at rank 20ish, now I don't want to brag but after spending some time on that rank it was obvious I wasn't improving much because the teams I met were not very good. So I stopped focussing on what I wanted to play and picked something that's essentially a hypercarry - something that doesn't rely on your team to win. For me this is Zeratul. It took me less than 60 games to reach rank 1 after mostly spamming him. You need to decide some things for yourself;   How good am I really? What is my goal in this game? Am I able to reach this goal with my current path? What's my biggest improvement?   I read here that you get in mismatched teams, this will continue to happen on all ranks. You also play Brightwing, now she's certainly really strong and she is able to carry games, you're still always reliant on your team to do well, because she mostly brings utility.  Now if your main goal for HL is to gain ranks it doesn't take much study to realize what champions are good to do so, lower ranks will have no idea how to stop The Lost Vikings, or how to deal with a strong Sylvanas who's an intelligent splitpusher, while still impacting teamfights. Nova and Zeratul both bring great carry potential, since they use stealth, something lower ranks don't pay enough attention too. Jaina is an all-round carry that's capable of deciding teamfights on her own terms. KT seems like this, but I feel he requires much more time to hit his powerspikes to essentially solocarry games, even though when he eventually hits them he will be more able to.  Champions I was unsuccesfull with on lower ranks, are now able to get positive winrates on 3kish MMR because they bring utility or have a concept that players need to be aware off, think abathur the closer you get to your true MMR (about 100 games played) the more likely you are to carry on champions like BW, since your environment in on your level and therefore bringing good utility becomes more relevant. If you consistently meet teams who are not on that level, I feel you should focus on hard carry champs to do exactly that.  I do have to point out that on the lowest ranks you should not have much trouble climbing, even when you are faced with some bad games, some teams have such poor knowledge of how MOBA's work that they will ignore your splitpush, while you simply get 1-2 levels for free. I can not count the amount of Valla games where it litterly took 5 minutes before someone would show up to stop me from pushing lanes. My team would even flame me because they didn't realize that me pushing gave us bigger advantages than chasing kills all over the map, you only want to join low elo teams when you really have to, for important map mechanics or when you're able to win/clean up fights that are close. I'm not saying ignore your teams, but rather find lanes your enemy seems to ignore and gain as much EXP soak as possible while they derp around on the map."
NexusNewbies,3ajlz3,iuppi,3,Sun Jun 21 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"Hero league is a tough animal to face solo queue.  Even if you know the right moves and what strategies work, oftentimes it is just as much of a struggle getting your team on board as it is executing against the other team.  Sometimes you're going to lose despite playing well.  BUT do not made the mistake I was making for awhile.  I was so busy breaking down my teammate's misplays that I wasn't taking a look enough at what mistakes I was making that were also hurting my team.    Remember, it is still preseason.  Take this time to try and improve yourself as a player.  Every game.  Try and improve yourself as a leader.  If people don't know what to do? Tell them.  If people don't agree with you or seem to be falling in line with someone else, follow their lead.  The thing that really separates HotS from other MOBAs is that team play is paramount.  People can't go off and do their own thing and succeed.    I'll add that HL is tough and getting tougher as more people level to rank 30.  I also, sadly, am falling down the MMR rabbit hole others have mentioned in this video (was on a brutal 9 game losing streak where many of the loses were from poor team coordination combined with lesser drafts).  Keep your head up.  These games don't really matter.  If you're not having fun, play in QM and then try and queue HL with friends.  Just know that it may mess up your MMR long term."

NexusNewbies,3ajlz3,MysterySteve,2,Sun Jun 21 00:16:38 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what's up with this game, or why it's soloQ matchmaking system is so poor compared with other MOBAs, but I haven't had a single game in HL that hasn't been a profound stomp one way or the other. I experienced competitive games on a fairly regular basis in QM, but literally not once in HL.  You'll get a lot of general ""how to improve"" advice in here - all useful obviously - but the solo matchmaking experience is definitely a lot weaker than every other team game I've played. Hopefully it's just the case that the system is still ""learning"" where the new population's skill is, but your experience definitely isn't unique."
NexusNewbies,3aju28,SelfImmolationsHell,3,Sat Jun 20 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of Reghar and Malf in both QM and HL so hopefully I can give you a bit of insight. Now let me preface this by saying that I am in no way a pro, or even close to one. I just like playing support and wanna help a brotha (or sista?) out. Ok, so if you want to try out support I would suggest starting with Li Li. She is super easy to use due to her ""auto heal"" to whoever has the lowest HP on your team around you. I don't mean auto as in it will do it on it's own, I just mean that when you use her heal you don't have to select a hero to heal. Simply press the button! As for positioning and getting the ""feel"" of the support role I would suggest sticking with your squishiest ally at the start of the match. (Valla, Illidan, Kael...pretty much any assassin) Stay with them, slightly behind them so you don't get caught out of position by the enemy. Heal them when they need it, and help poke enemies/clear waves of minions. I normally stay with that character for a while until either a team fight breaks out in another lane, or if I am specifically requested by an ally. After the initial teamfight I will analyze who is in what lane, against which enemies, and who REALLY needs me. Again, it's going to be a squishy assassin 99% of the time. They are the source of your DPS which is always needed, so keep them alive! The most important things to remember when supporting are remaining vigilant about your positioning and managing your mana. A support who is OOM (out of mana) is just a hero who is easy to kill and offers nothing to his/her team. Remain behind your tanks and assassins and heal as needed. Another good support to try out is Reghar, and I say that because his heal is a chain heal. This means that you cast your heal on the ally who needs it most, and the other allies around him will get some heals as well. This is great because you can heal multiple enemies instead of just one at a time. I really hope that helps a little. I know it may be a little scatter-brained but I tried my best. Good luck!"
NexusNewbies,3aju28,GoldenTicket_HotS,3,Sun Jun 21 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"These are really good pointers for Support. Like OP, I am terrified of playing Support, mostly because I'm not sure where I need to be, aside from team fights. I assumed sticking on a Warrior was the right thing to do, but helping a squishy assassin makes a lot more sense.   My biggest issue is mana conservation. You say you play Malfurion? I just got him to level 4 in Training and did 1 QM that we lost horribly on. My biggest question is: when do you recommend I use Moonfire and Entangling Roots? I feel like knowing when to use those is the most important part of playing him, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. Any advice you can give for him I would greatly appreciate. :3"
NexusNewbies,3aju28,AC_Mobius,3,Sun Jun 21 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm basically in the same situation as the redditor above : i like playing support in QM & HL (Reghar & Uther lvl 10 and Malf on the road to 10), but i'm not a pro player, neither a high ranked player (rank 29 ATM).   Indeed, Malfurion's mana gestion is pretty ""touchy"". I get used to it and have never though about ""rules"", so I tried to figure out some tips, but be advised this is not the ""absolute truth"".  First : be sure to grab a lot of regen globe to increase your mana generation. Before lvl 10, you can even deal some life to get one (but don't be a kamikaze). After mid-game, take any occasion to get one (just kill the minion that  give one when you cross a lane for example) Heal will always have the priority, unless i can secure a kill with other skills. Keep grabbing globe In the early game, I prefer use Roots instead of Moonfire to kill creeps waves. I usually keep Moonfire to reveal a cloaked hero. Grab globe again Do not hesitate to back regen before going to objective (mines, shrines etc). Learn the timing to know when to back. Finally, be sure to grab enough globe. ;-)"
NexusNewbies,3aju28,To-Ga,3,Sun Jun 21 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I could help out a little! With Malf it depends. If you build him to be more aggressive with hindering moonfire, entangling/tenacious roots then you will of course be using them more often and focus less on your healing. I normally will do this is our team has another support such as Li Li or Reghar. With that being said the timing of these abilities is crucial. For the roots, which are my favorite part about Malf, it depends on who is chasing who. Say you are low on health and running away from one or more enemies with no team mates around you, throw down your roots behind you so your chasing enemies will get stuck in them, thus giving you some time and room to escape. This will take some practice to perfect, but once you get it down consistently, it will separate you from just average Malf players. Now if you want to use them offensively, I normally throw down some roots in front of an enemy when I am hiding in the bushes. If the enemy(ies) are about to engage your team mates, even better. A well placed root can help to decimate the enemy team. Notice how I said help; as a healer it is important to ALWAYS remember that you are not a wrecking ball or an enforcer, you are simply a tool to maximize your teams longevity and attacking potential.  As for Moonfire I normally use it to poke early to mid game, but then use it to finish off enemies who have low health later on in the game. It does a surprising amount of damage if you build it up through your talents. Also, the strike radius of it is bigger than it seems, so use that to your advantage.  With all of that being said, in terms of mana conservation, it all depends on what your team needs. Are you the only healer? Then focus your talents for that and heal all the things. Is there another support on your team? Then you can get away with building Malf a bit more aggressive. Talk to your other support at the start of the game to get an idea of what they want to do and go from there! Hope that helps! If you have ANY questions about Heroes I'm always willing to help. Just send me a message."
NexusNewbies,3aju28,GoldenTicket_HotS,5,Mon Jun 22 00:00:56 2015 UTC,You rock. Awesome detailed response. I appreciate it.
NexusNewbies,3aju28,AC_Mobius,2,Mon Jun 22 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all it's nbd to practice vs AI and even QM to get comfortable with different roles. Sometimes a support should stick to someone, like Rehgar on Illidan, who can wipe teams with good support, but usually you soak with your team (try not to lane alone, but it's not the end of the world if you do) and go into objectives and teamfights with them as they develop. I think the hardest thing is knowing when to lay back from a bad engagement, as you don't offer a lot of power, and when to follow your team into a fight because they need you, even if you don't like going in."
NexusNewbies,3aju28,Zarco19,0,Sat Jun 20 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"If you want to play in hero league, you have to draft. To make sure you have a well rounded team, you'll sometimes need to play support because everyone else picked warrior/assassin roles. Because of that, it's highly recommended to own 3 warriors, 3 assassins, 3 supports and a specialist or another hero you're comfortable playing.    It's 3 of each because the enemy team might pick the one support you like to play and you'll have to play someone else.    I hate playing support, but like you, I know that a great support player can dominate a game and that is a really exciting feeling. I want to be that player for my team when necessary. If you want to be successful at this game, you just have to get good with a few supports.    The three supports I'm working on are: Brightwing(the obvious choice in win percentage over the others), Uther(can tank and body block better than others and continues to help out after death), and Rehgar. These 3 also have the highest win percentage overall for supports on hotslogs.com."
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,Lotusx21,3,Sat Jun 20 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"The specialists are usually hybrid roles between the normal ones or have a special talent that doesn't fall into warrior, assassin or support. Specialists are usually pretty good at lane pushing, like Azmodan, SGT Hammer, and Sylvanas because they do extra damage to structures, can nullify the towers from shooting or can over power enemy minions.    If you're like me and enjoy ranged assassins/support, I'd recommend Sylvanas. She's fantastic in solo lane and she has decent burst damage 1 v 1 especially at level 13(16?) when she gets a talent that makes enemies affected by her Shadow Dagger vulnerable(they take 25% more damage while affected). Shadow Dagger also spreads to nearby enemy minions or heroes. That single ability is why she takes down enemy minions so well. In addition to that, her trait allows her basic attacks to stun enemy minions, towers(stopping them from attacking) and even mercenaries, essentially allowing you to solo merc camps from level 1.    Throw in a decent AoE/escape ability and she's pretty well rounded. Highly recommend trying her out.    For Nazeebo, I've never played him, but he seems good at pushing because he summons lots of extra minions to fight along-side you making it easy to overwhelm a lane if left alone. For TLV, they are great for laning, because they can split up and soak xp from all three lanes at the same time while only granting the enemy team 25% xp from killing one of the three and a total of 75% if all killed. Basically giving your team an xp advantage. Abathur is his own breed of specialist in that he usually just hangs out behind a wall and supports the team by laying mines around the map and giving the ""hat"" to team mates. It allows him to activate offensive/defensive abilities from that team member and assist in attacking or shielding them. Basically, you can make a 1 v 2 fight in the enemy's favor even by providing a hat. The ability to ""be anywhere on the map"" to assist your team is a great asset."
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,RogueT3ch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:47:25 2015 UTC,"I see. So the specialist role would be a mixture of potential roles, one more towards a specific role and one for another one - like one being more supporty, assassiny or tanky caracther right? So it seems like it's neither white or black, it's grey?    Yeah, Sylvanas seems very simple to play I might pick her up later."
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,binbrun,2,Sun Jun 21 23:43:55 2015 UTC,"I would say that specialists are the ones who break stuff around the map. They are not bursty like assassins, they are more about constant damage whenever they are around. They don't kill, but they hit easily.   I play regularly 3 specialists, so I can teach you a little about them.  Zagara: All her moves is about summoning minions to fight. She also have a decent auto-attack. By casting minions and shooting from a distance, she can poke and damage constantly while staying safe. Her creep also gives great mobility and vision. But since she is all about casting minions, she have no escape and no moves to help her out of a sticky situation.   Sgt Hammer: Biggest range in the whole game. She is all about bombarding stuff. If her team protects well, she can fire constantly at the enemy, adding crazy amount of damage. Unlike Zagara, she have some moves to escape, but she is really slow. She is all about finding a good position to damage constantly using her auto-attacks.  Abathur: My favorite. He's all about map presence. His body is weak, you can't use him to fight. He haves 2 moves, Symbiote and Mines. Mines just drop mines where you want, giving you some vision and damage if somebody walks over it. Symbiote ""possess"" an allied hero, minion or building. From there, he can shoot spikes or drop a shield. He can remove his Symbiote when he wants, and jump to another ally to boost him. He also generates a small minion (locust) that can help push a lane. Played correctly, you can boost any allies in need while constantly pushing and soaking XP.  Others have suggested Sylvanas and is a good choice. She is similar to Valla in some ways. If not, I think Zagara is an interesting choice if you play safe (like Lili, cast your stuff and stay behind). Hammer only if you're good with positioning and map awareness (easy to snipe if you're not careful). Stay away from Abathur for the time being. He's really really hard to play and grasp. There is nothing like him."
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,binbrun,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"People told me Zagara was quite alright. Although i found her trait odd, i could only understand it gives you movement speed and health regeneration. I might end up going for Sylvanas but a friend told me her push/assassin build is better than the full push build. However i feel like her utility on pushing is if you have a minion wave or mercs with you while keeping them alive all the time with Sylvanas's passive rather then the kit itself allowing it to ""push better"" in comparison to other specialists. Point is, in case i want a diferent thing than Sylvanas, which specialist would you reccomend?"
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,micfijasan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"If you want an ""entry-level"" specialist, I would say Zagara or Nazeebo (almost forgot about him). They are useful in team fights and can provide good pushing power. Also, Zagara is probably the best hero 1v1 in a lane early game.   The trait of Zagara comes from Starcraft 2. The best Zerg players (the race Zagara is) are the ones who put actively creep on the map. It's the same thing in Hots, the more you put creep, the better you have vision and escape route (you move at 120% on creep, your minions too). You can also put the tumors in the bushes to give you vision, preventing ganks.   You can't really focus your damage with Nazeebo, he's more about zone damage. But he plays similar to Zagara, you cast your stuff from a distance, you stay alive and you provide constant damage whenever you can.   I would class specialists like that:  Safe to start: Zagara, Nazeebo, Sylvanas  Tricky: Azmodan, Hammer, Gazlowe  WTF is that?: Abathur, Murky, Lost Vikings"
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,italianhandgun,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:52:37 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for your input! I'll make sure to try them in the next rotations.
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,iuppi,2,Mon Jun 22 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Specialists fall into 3 categories for me:  1) The ""push"" category you mentioned. Achieved by either being capable of avoiding tower damage (Sylvanas, Hammer), or by spawning something to tank the shots (Azmodan, Gazlowe, Zagara).  2) Having some sort of gimmick attached to their playstyle. This is specifically the Lost Vikings, Murky, and Abathur, as their playstyles are so weird compared to the rest of the cast that they don't fit in any other category.  3) Nazeebo. Looking at his kit, he really strikes me more as an assassin. I guess it's because all of his abilities summon things, but I'd lump him in closer to a poison-themed mage than anything else."
NexusNewbies,3ajzvu,Gorgoleon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:06:59 2015 UTC,"Nazeebo can push towers if you use his W to tank the tower shots, also his spiders allow you to ""out range"" towers because the spiders can't take damage from the towers."

NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,dreamslave,13,Sat Jun 20 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on the situation, the state of the map, and who you are.   I'll use two examples.  Scenario 1:   Map - Haunted Mines 30 second timer for the 4th Golem skulls to appear goes off Enemy core is at 85% Team fight at enemy core. I'm arrive mid battle, bodies flying around the screen. A team, not mine, triumphant. Keal'Thas's broken body crumpled at the steps of a ruined keep.  Friendly Core is at 60% has shields regenerated. No minions at the moment.  Golems are at both cores waiting to awaken. Timers for friendlies is at 35-55 seconds.  I am Sylvannas, and I am in enemy territory. Enemy team has everyone.    I first look at the mini map and see if I can see where they are heading. I've escape to the top of the map, and three are coming towards me clearing a wave of minions. One is clearing out minions bot. And I don't know where the 5th is.   The three group turns to get  siege (really?!?) so I actually go into the mines and turn left. There are no minions to betray my position, I'm effectively hidden. Siege alerts me that they have been taken. The clock is ticking. 15 seconds until skulls activate. Watching the map, I see bot hero go into the mines, and to the right I then see the three heroes top head for the mines. They want the 100 skulls.   One word. greedy.   They go for the right side of the underground map, the same exact path they have taken every time in the game. I slip out top, and race for the core. I type my teammates, who are 5-10 seconds from res to ignore skulls, Rush core. I run into Sgt. Hammer. With minions. She is waiting near the broken Keep gates.   Fuck. I'm found.   I explode as best I can but only get Hammer to around 40% health. My W wipes out most of the minions, but still not much I can do. Knowing the game is done if I die, I use my E and get away. Hammer turns around and heads to base  Siege is gone, so I can't get that.   Skulls are being collected. Fast.   Two team members, Kael and Raynor res, and head over to me.   Skulls climbing. There are a couple camps left. And the golem below.   They avoid detection by cutting through the middle, avoiding the sight where possible. We know there is Hammer,   We meet up. The Muradin is back and on his way. Same route. Only the Golem is left.   Since we in the advanced party are all squishy as hell, I doubt we will live. But we push on.   In the core area, minions and Hammer are there. Minions spawn.   Great timing... Ugh.   Kael uses his trait, and with his firestorm , takes the minions out. I and Raynor focus on Hammer who hasn't healed from our run in 15 seconds ago. Dies.   Skulls now over 70  Kael pops ultimate- Phoenix, Raynor pops Hyperion.    Shield is gone. Core is dropping  I shift to the lower end of the Core, furthest away from the nexus. Kael and Raynor is at the 3 position. I'm at 5:30 position. I am spamming Q like like I'm a pianist doing a Bach piece with running 16th notes. Hitting the W when it comes off cool down. My mouse straining under the clicks. Since we have minimal minions coming from bot now, I am taking damage from the core.  Music crescendoing in my headphones. Fast music, hardcore music. Fun music.   Skulls stop accumulating. 100.   20%  fuck.   Heroes appear pouring out of the Nexus.  10%  Focus focus focus. We are getting there. ignore them please...  Kael goes down instantly. Glass cannon has done his job.   Raynor's Trait activates. he focuses on core.   Muradin appears, and leaps between me and the enemy.  Ultimates.   4%  Just a couple more seconds....  gg    Scenario 2   Map Sky Temple temples just got off. (Third round) My team lost the fight at mid temple.  I'm Motherfucking Lili Mid game... nearest first tier fort is gone. Bottom fort is alive, enemy goes top.    Since I have speed, I loop around through the jungle, and stay behind the fort, throwing blinding wind and my serpent, delaying tactics until the team comes back.   They take out the gate.   I fall back. No use dying for a gate. Wait for my team. I slow enough of the teams momentum so that they end up not taking the fort at that time. I run, stay out of range, and only dart in to blinding wind. They are focusing on the fort, but can turn at any moment. Holding q like a good boy to auto cast heal on myself. Wait for re enforcements.     When you are on your own, Map awareness is vital for your survival. You need to use the clues on the mini map to know where the enemy is going, and what they are doing. Are they taking camps? Clearing minions? Are they running past minions to go to boss? Are they not visible?!?tab to check enemy siege damage numbers to see if they are hitting boss are they pushing? Finishing objectives? The map (and the stats) will tell you everything you need to know. This will guide you in what you should do.   In the first scenario, I had several choices, I could have b back and waited at the core. Had the enemy team taken a minion wave on our side of the map, meaning they were skipping the mines, I would have B back from the mines to the core and prepared a defence, knowing that I would likely die. My goal at that point would be to slow them down however I could so that my team could have a chance at a fight. The downside was our squishiest heroes were coming back first.  I wait until they decide what to do. This gives me the widest options available. Once you commit, you commit.    I also took a huge risk. Had they turned left into the mines (where the larger groups of skulls were), I would have been found, and stuck and likely died. But, they were consistent in their habits and I took a calculated risk which paid off.   In the second scenario, it was much less dire, I didn't need to risk anything. Our levels were even, but I didn't want to let them have the xp bump by taking another fort.   The biggest thing to remember when alone is that you have options, but they are largely dictated by the other team. In both scenarios, they didn't chase me (too hard) , but had they, I would have kept running, using my E to get further away, or blinding win to deflect attacks and hope for the best. If they were coordinated, I would have B back. But in both cases they left me alone. In scenario one I gave myself as many options as possible for the benefit of the team. The stakes were at their highest and committing early may mean a missed opportunity later. Hanging my ass out in the wind helped me there, but I had to hide, sneak, and avoid as much as possible to do it... And I still almost fucked up.   The second scenario needed not for theatrics and risk, but common sense. I wasn't strong enough to do a camp. Minions would give me Xp, but leaving the team U harried would have been worse. Using the fort to help cover me, I could take pot shots at them while waiting for the Calvary to arrive.   Sorry this went long, but I hope it helps."

NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,wanderlustcub,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"First off I want to thank you for this wonderful, detailed post! It's been very helpful. I feel like I've learned a lot from your post. I kinda have a followup question now. Do you think that knowing what the situation calls for will come as I improve in positioning, map awareness, and other stuff I'm already working on, or is it something I'm going to really focus on? Also, should I start studying the enemy team to see how predictable they are with their strategies and things like you mentioned?"
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,wanderlustcub,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"Hello and thank you! I am glad it has helped you out!   For me, it is Prioritisation. When to do something, what to do next. In order to make the best decisions, that means positioning, Map awareness, and communication with my teammates. What do I need to do next? should be followed by all of these things.    The other thing you will need is time. You will get to the point where you won't ask the question ""what next?"" but simply react to the situation at hand. If there is a 4 Hero wipe on my team, I have to prioritise my actions, starting with ""living"" and I go from there.   On the flip side, if my team just wiped 4 players. Then I think about the following:    Can we get boss (where are we, How many of us are alive, how long are the death resets, who is alive to stop us) Can we finish the Objective (And use that objective to push) Can we push a Fort of Keep (So that we are up in XP)  Can we collect Merc camps (to give the other team more threats on the board so we can continue to push/get other objectives quickly)   As for Learning the Enemies movements. You should always want to anticipate your enemy. That means scoping them out early game so that you have a fair knowledge of what they will do late game. Think of this as Game time Recon. Similar to Football players watching tapes of the other team leading up to the game, knowing what your opponent does helps inform your decisions.   In my first Scenario, the opponent were making non standard decisions. They made several mistakes throughout the game. Their priorities were wrong. For example, after the 4 Hero wipe, they should have pushed. Ignored everything else and push. That would have put us in a situation to react with one hero vs. five. Instead, they got a camp and went into the mines. That gave me many more options to work with. Their mistakes were my opening.   Also, people tend to have habits. So if you know that they almost always do the same thing each Objective, then you can anticipate it. conversely, don't make your gameplay repetitive, because your opponent will begin to anticipate you and that could very easily be game over.   Good luck, and if you need anything just message me! I will help where I can!   Btag: wanderlstcub#1461"

NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,phoenixmike,11,Sat Jun 20 14:15:13 2015 UTC,This is really it.  Most common way to throw a game in quick match is to have staggered deaths and people trickling into the enemy team 1 or 2 at a time.  Do what you can safely.  Watch the minimap and avoid the other team.
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,JustAmys,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"^ This.  The absolute most important part is to stay alive until your team is back.  You really won't be able to make a serious contribution by yourself, but if you do die your team will still be outnumbered once they've respawned.  If I wipe 4 of the enemy team, most of the time my team is going to immediately go steal their merc campus and/or boss which means those are dangerous places for the last man standing to be.  Often not worth the risk!"
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,hacdladf1,2,Sat Jun 20 15:57:02 2015 UTC,This happens to me on support a bit as well. Since I predominately play brightwing I go through a priority list in my head.   (Because I take bribe) Take a merc camp. Push a different lane. Stall enemy team.   There are some instances where stalling the enemy team will override the others but for the most part a favor causing pressure and getting as much experience for the team as I can while everyone else is down.  Since I'm new too I don't know if this is exactly what I should be doing but that's my reasoning at least.  Can someone tell me if this is good or bad?
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,JustAmys,4,Sat Jun 20 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"If you don't die, then it's good. If you die, then it's bad. Pushing a different lane could be dropped because it's so dangerous and you don't have much pushing power as Brightwing if you don't take promote and are alone. Stalling their team is always good and grabbing merc camps is good, but not because of the pushing power, but because it prevents their team from getting it and giving your team an extra thing to deal with when they spawn."
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,hacdladf1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:26:26 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks!
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,iuppi,5,Sun Jun 21 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"After reading this again to remember what it was I was being thanked for I want to add that pushing back lanes is a good idea. Like say if they're coming up against your towers or core, then feel free to clear them out. Just be wary of the enemy team's location and don't follow your minion waves out into open areas or onto the other side of the map."
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,Snacksfan,2,Sun Jun 21 04:28:52 2015 UTC,"Rehgar can clear pretty much all merc camps, just understand where your enemy will be and what you can do with that information. If all you can do is push lane, then push lane. If you can get a merc camp because all lanes are pushed or they have too many numbers to stop you, then go merc camp."
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,hossimo,2,Sun Jun 21 01:19:13 2015 UTC,Just don't stick your neck out and die. Don't go for anything that you're not positive will be safe. Scattered death timers and unsure attitudes are a big factor in throwing games. There's nothing wrong with playing it safe and just clearing close minion waves.
NexusNewbies,3ahxt1,henrax,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"I find myself in this situation a lot as Li Li, what I do depends but in all cases I try not do die.   If there is an objective up I'll try and poke to see if they are going for it,   If we have a pushed in lane I'll try to defend from the creeps.   But generally I just try to find out what they are doing, and not die."
NexusNewbies,3akc55,mhedaya123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:18:40 2015 UTC,"Smite is pretty different from not only HotS, but the moba genre in general. With the camera being different, a lot of your mechanics won't transfer over as easily either. In hots, there is no last hitting, there is no defined ""jungler"" role, lanes are not static, team comps are way more focused on the comp/the map than they are lane setups, no items, etc. Tbh, if you liked ADC's, play Valla in HotS, and see how you like it, as it's a very different game."
NexusNewbies,3akc55,EnvyHotS,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"The transition will probably be hard at first, but HotS isn't too hard to pick up overall.  As for heroes, start out by playing the ones on free week. If you find yourself on a different week thinking, ""I really wish I was playing X hero right now,"" then look into buying it. Based on your suggestions, Valla and Raynor would be good places to start, and they're both free every 3 weeks or so. From looking at the Loki/Thor wiki pages, I'd look into Falstad, Thrall, Zeratul, and Nova, though they're more expensive and will likely take time to earn."
NexusNewbies,3akc55,micfijasan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:24:46 2015 UTC,"Thrall is probably your closest to Thor. Zeratul is probably the closest to Loki. Most assassins (that don't have cloak) are classified as ADC's. Valla is a straight right click ADC whereas Kerrigan is a combo. Definitely a ton of different and diverse styles in this - try them all on free week! (Especially Sgt. Hammer, for no reason other than it's a bloody tank.)"

NexusNewbies,3ak572,g4ttsu,3,Sun Jun 21 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"Some of the rewards you get along the way of leveling your profile are extra slots in the hero rotation. Like previous post mentioned, you get an extra slot at level 12, and another at 15."
NexusNewbies,3aj1o6,Cairden,6,Sat Jun 20 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the map, but more than that, it depends on who you are going up against.  Going up against a team with a healer? A healer is probably a good idea, unless you have a lot of hard CC to zero in and lock him down.  Going up against a team with a lot of warriors? You are going to want some high damage to counter their huge HP pools.  Going up against a lot of specialist? Either need a good specialist on your team or a stealth hero to counter their pushes.  Going up against a lot of assassins? Get heroes with a lot of ohshit buttons and sustain to live through the burst and outlast them.  Fighting on a small map? Get heroes that excel at early game to push that advantage hard. Lots of team fighting too, so AoE has more of a place, particularly skillshot choke-point-friendly AoE, than single target damage.  Fighting on a large map? Get heroes that can excel in soak lanes, push hard and get advantages quickly. Mobility is key. Heroes that can have global presence are a plus. Heroes that can solo camps or hold objectives (or disrupt them) are amazing.  Fighting against a balanced team? Get a balanced team.  Fighting against 5 healers? Get 5 warriors.  Warriors can make healer's life a living hell, but can get outplayed and burst down by assassins. Assassins can take out specialists quickly, but get shut down by CC or healers. Specialists can give you huge map advantages but are vulnerable to assassins. Supports can give your team an advantage as a whole, but can get shut down by hit and run tactics.  There is no optimal overall strategy other than adapting to the strategy of the enemy team, your strengths, your team, talent builds for both teams, the map, playing around bans if you're doing competitive, etc.  The best advice I can give you is to learn the heroes, learn the interactions, and you'll start to recognize counters without even thinking about it."
NexusNewbies,3aj1o6,kirolm,2,Sat Jun 20 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome response, thanks a ton for the information. It does seem to be a rock paper scissors type balancing, and getting more scissors to beat there paper (or rock-scissor whatever) is what is best it seems. Thanks again :-)"
NexusNewbies,3aj1o6,Zarco19,2,Sat Jun 20 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"Usually every team needs a tank, a healer, and usually 2 DPS (though 1 can be ok sometimes), with the last slot being an assassin, a 2nd tank/healer, an off-support like Tassadar, or a specialist. Teams can deviate from this but this is pretty standard and solid.  Another thing to look at is having a good balance of frontline and backline. If your team is something like a Tank, Sylvanas, and 2 Ranged DPS, you should probably pick a melee support like Uther that can stand on the front line and CC/bodyblock to protect your ranged heroes.  Finally, a good team has access to CC, good initiation, some semblace of mobility, etc. In other words, you want a team that is versatile enough to fill niches."
NexusNewbies,3ajrzf,somkeweed123,3,Sat Jun 20 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"Tychus is really fun to play. His main issue is that he's inconsistent: he has significant strengths and weaknesses. He's an extremely mobile assassin, and by that I mean you can maintain movement while continuing to put out maximum damage via his Q (Overkill). Overkill also lets you use your other basic abilities as well, so you can Run and Gun to escape or catch up while channeling Overkill or use Frag Grenade to create distance. He's also got fantastic pushing power via his level 4 talent Melting Point.   Tychus also has, in my opinion, two primary issues. Firstly, he's extremely short ranged. The wind up time combined with his shorter auto attack range mean you probably won't be auto attacking much in fights unless you're hitting a diving enemy. Secondly, and I think his primary weakness, is getting Overkill disrupted. Other assassins have the advantage of being set and forget: you drop Kael's Flamestrike and that's it. There's no way to prevent Kael from using Flamestrike if he has the capability to (IE, not crowd controlled). Tychus, on the other hand, has a huge majority of his damage come from an interruptable channeled ability with a long (15 second) cooldown. That means that if you start channeling and are hit with a CC of any sort, your damage output plummets significantly.   In terms of playstyle, I think he's my favorite ranged assassin. Mobility of a melee assassin plus fantastic pushing power make him really fun to play. In terms of effectiveness, he's no Kael/Jaina. They may not have the same mobility as Tychus but their damage output is much more consistent."

Generally I wouldn't recommend Abathur if you aren't playing with friends, Abathur's got quite a bad reputation.  For Tychus I'm not sure, have almost never seen him played myself and I've never seen him picked in pro games, so it's safe to assume he's in a rather bad state."

However, you need to use more abilites on the wave so he doesn't force you to lane whilst he goes for objectives early on. Later in the game, by just using keg to prevent him from doing a setup, or to push him towards your team would be the only thing you can do, chen doesn't do anything at this point.  Tychus just destroys chen, there's really no counterplay.  You can prob eliminate his damage potential if you keg him far away from the fight, but that's it.   Chen is overall in a terrible spot atm, unless your opponents are of a lower calibre than you, the chance of losing is astronomically higher."
NexusNewbies,3ahol3,b_oarder,2,Sat Jun 20 07:22:38 2015 UTC,the +range/damage talent is on the same tier as the mutalist talent so no they dont stack as you cant get them both. you can however get brood expansion which wold allow two charges of mutalist if you want.
NexusNewbies,3ahol3,CynicCorvus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:54:38 2015 UTC,Mutalisks aren't hindered by walls like hydralisks are. That's something to keep in mind when to sic them on an opponent.
NexusNewbies,3ahe7f,professionalevilstar,2,Sat Jun 20 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. Brightwing doesn't have an efficient clear but it's still easy to stack up kills for bribes using Q and just passively laning before using Z to jump to objectives or team fights. I wouldn't use promote as Envenom and Shield are better options. Envenom after a polymorph can melt squishies after a few autoattacks or a Q. Don't waste it on a tank.  Rhegar probably has the best clear by self casting W, becoming a wolf, and lunging at the middle of the minions. Uther's W comes out in a straight line so it's efficient in that sense. At level 16 can make lane clearing more efficient but that's way beyond the classic laning phase and benediction might be more useful. You are right he doesn't have damage but has AWESOME stuns. Unfortunately, in quick matches no one will usually take advantage of your 5 enemy divine storm :/  With malf you can use E to lane clear but it's not mana efficient and he is better off laning with someone who can actually clear lanes like a boss but needs mana like a KT (since malf's trait can give mana over time). The little tree guy you could get at level 4 can help waste ammo but i usually pick other talents.   I love Tass and Tyrande, but they aren't really healers and in QM, the matchmaking system will always match you up against teams with a true healer."
NexusNewbies,3ahe7f,nochroot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"Supports aren't meant to have great clear, or all that much damage to begin with, uther and rehgar clear the fastest out of the healing supports"
NexusNewbies,3ahe7f,ionxeph,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:23:46 2015 UTC,Of all supports it is Tassadar.   You will struggle to put out quality healing versus the healing supports though.  Of the healing supports it is probably Rehgar.  You can lightning shield your own totem if you dont want to be in melee and I think a minion but even if you can that wouldnt be as efficient as minions wouldnt be in the middle to really clear a wave.
NexusNewbies,3afdtl,Woundar,2,Fri Jun 19 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"tldr: play heroes that require map awareness like bw and etc because they can jump to other parts of the map and set up a timer to beep every 15 seconds.  I don't think you need any of these, you just need to have a constant curiosity about what else is going on the map that you should be feeding. Don't get too focused on just what you're doing. It's like in a chess game you look at the whole board, not just your current move.   I look at the towers. I look at the forts. I look and try to count 5 enemy heroes. I look at where my team is. I look at objectives. I look at xp and who is dead. I look at score screen and talent choices.   I think a timer is a bad idea because I don't just want to glance at the minimap I want to understand what is going on. So I look less often than 15 seconds but I look long enough to see what is going on. I try to look as often as possible."

NexusNewbies,3afdtl,cthomlan,0,Sat Jun 20 02:52:26 2015 UTC,You can use it to see if enemy is taking boss if you don't see them attacking towers and siege is going up.
NexusNewbies,3afdtl,swartkrans,0,Sat Jun 20 03:54:10 2015 UTC,really every 15 seconds is not often enough but i guess it's just trying to get people into the habit. It's natural for starcraft players to pay attention to it.
NexusNewbies,3ah8gt,Anjo_Smash,2,Sat Jun 20 03:58:48 2015 UTC,Your friend is sort of right..however if you watch the pro plays they are able to rotate between the lanes extremely well so they dont lose on much exp. even so this isnt that common and they will still often soak all the lanes. But on our scrub level? no dont try this always have someone soaking lanes.   i see this attitude alot honestly but trying to replicate what the pros do isnt the best idea all the time. the skill gap is so huge that alot of average players wont understand the decision making process behind it. These team practise alot and can weigh up the risk/reward much better then normal players.   tk/dr - at average skill level  its best to play safe and soak everylane in early game
NexusNewbies,3ah8gt,CynicCorvus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:07:11 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is exactly what I had in mind. I honestly felt that we kept losing because of trying to constantly group early game.
NexusNewbies,3ah8gt,CynicCorvus,2,Sat Jun 20 04:11:47 2015 UTC,"not a problem. if your friend does like the ball up and roam tactic maybe suggest a 2 person roaming comp to que as, like kerrigan+arthas or tyrande+a burst assasin"
NexusNewbies,3ah8gt,kirolm,2,Sat Jun 20 04:39:37 2015 UTC,"Usually, you want one person in each lane, rest of the players grouped and rotating between lanes setting up picks, pushing lanes to manipulate map control and being the first at map objectives as the rest of the team transitions into team fighting.  Before Lv. 10, kills don't net you as much XP as you will usually get from soaking lanes and taking down fortifications. Essentially, anywhere the enemies roam team isn't should start getting pushed. When the roam comes around, pull back. This back and forth happens with roaming team hopefully catching any overextensions or mispositioning by the enemy team.   Once you hit 10, kills become a lot more valuable not only because of the XP, but because death timers mean making members of the opposite team unavailable for group combat. This means taking uncontested map objectives and boss camps. You should regularly clear merc camps on your side of the map as you need to to push lanes (not just randomly so they get killed before doing damage). Map objectives tend to be the strongest decider of where the game is going and should always be priority.  You will never be as strong individually as you are together as a team. Unless you have a very specific push strategy that will revolve around one person pushing, you want to group up as much as possible. A 4v5 will almost always turn out in favor of the bigger group. That's why you group later all the time but can split your attention earlier where, if the enemy team decides to group and slam one lane and kill the Gazlowe there 11 times, it won't mean as much as the damage you did in other lanes and the soak you get from multiple lanes."

Abathur uses Ultimate Evolution to copy Zagara and together they attack the enemy keep.

He's a good pick if you have a melee assassin or if the enemy team has any stealthies.  I really like supporting, and when I choose the hero it's usually to counterpick their team or deny them good synergy."
NexusNewbies,3af8q6,Mr_Kid,3,Fri Jun 19 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Tyrande is considered in the same category as tassadar. She just doesn't have the raw healing output as the others. She does have super high utility though, with vision and stuns and her huntersmark debuff.   Rhegar, brightwing and Uther are all considered top teir because their healing has an AOE element to it along with some form of crowd control. Uther can stun, BW can use her polymorph and Rhegar has his slowing totem. Malfurion can provide some great healing but his is based on healing over time and isn't as effective against high burst combos like Kael+Jaina. His CC ability can be a bit harder to land than the others as well.  Lili is considered bad because her healing can't be targeted and she has to spec into her CC and put it on an ability that doesn't quite do enough anyway since it only helps against auto attacks and so many people favor ability heroes."

NexusNewbies,3acx6o,cocogate,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"I don't want to have to do that just to play against cloak. As a Valla player I'm trying to find ways to play smarter, like sticking with group, positioning and knowing to stand your group in some situations (some cases you can just out burst Nova)"
NexusNewbies,3acx6o,snowpuppii,2,Fri Jun 19 15:51:36 2015 UTC,I do that too. I was laning near the dragon knight capture point for xp. I kinda needed an upgrade though since I was on absolute minimum graphics before a medium resolution of 1280x1024 with avg of 4-17 fps... Now Im at 1920x1080 running at Extreme (the max) settings at 60-98 fps. I capped it at 60 though since my monitor is only 60hz. Its like going from a 20 year old beat up truck to the brand new corvette sting ray XD

NexusNewbies,3acx6o,bsmntdwlr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"Depending on the build, nova can have enough burst even without her snipe to bring a Valla down to low, at which point she may be able to AA you once and down you."

Toxicity in QM is a minor inconvenience compared to how much funnier the game gets when you have some challenge. It's a completely different game, and if you just mute annoying people you have zero trouble."
NexusNewbies,3acx6o,henrax,6,Fri Jun 19 11:04:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I kinda stupidly rushed into QM before doing any AI matches, and I never had any problems with bm despite being ridiculously unprepared.

NexusNewbies,3acx6o,Not_Nigerian_Prince,2,Fri Jun 19 11:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've called some ppl out before and it helps. If someone is just constantly raging though, I'll just mute them. Not only is it annoying, but it is also a pain when someone complaining types so many messages it starts to take up space on your screen.  As for QM, I nvr really fooled w/ AI games. When I first started I went through each tutorial and then training. Then I did one AI match and went to QM."

NexusNewbies,3acx6o,henrax,3,Fri Jun 19 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as hard as it is to start with, you learn so much more in QM than AI. I generally only AI to finish dailies if I'm short on time. I don't think I've ever had an AI match go for more than 15-20 and I've never lost one. Losing in this game (probably most games) is the key to improving your skills, so go for it in QM. Mute or report abusive people but understand when they have a point but don't fear playing against other players.  Edit: I actually came very close to losing an AI game this afternoon on mines when the other players completely ignored collecting skulls.  And it occurred to me that I think people playing AI games are often only grinding out XP or just want to play but aren't interested in any of the strategy involved.  So doubling down on the my previous commend and saying go QM."

NexusNewbies,3acx6o,just_another_ryan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"It depends. I had a humorous match where a Lili kept giving the enemy Zeratul a water dragon that revealed his location realllly easy. I would assume the same could be said about Rehgar's shield (not sure I haven't tried or seen it done, may test tomorrow in game if I remember in custom match with buddy). As for healing, the people below have answered that. Observant and experienced players will figure it out, but sometimes it may be worth the risk if they really need the heal.  So watch out for Lili and cloud serpenting stealthies, otherwise I'm not sure. Another stealthy warning is to beware Abathur tophats on a Nova dropping clones. The clones do NOT get the tophat."

NexusNewbies,3agvbv,MexiShadow,2,Sat Jun 20 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that you can't just pick a hero and be a carry like you might in LoL or DOTA.  With team experience shared and gold farming not being a thing, it's going to come down to team work and getting your group to work together.  To that end, I find warriors tend to be best for me to get people to move along.  I dunno, maybe it's my old WoW tanking days, but somehow I'm better able to get people to step in line when I'm the one that can soak the opposing team's damage.  it's unfortunate that people are playing heroes ofr the first time in HL instead of in QM, but that's the nature of the game being so new.  Given enough time, general game knowledge will increase.  For now, just embrace the fact that it is Preseason and work on cleaning up your own play as best you can."
NexusNewbies,3agvbv,asher1611,2,Sat Jun 20 01:59:20 2015 UTC,Maybe you could play Nova or Zeratul and just roam and get your team fed. The level advantage may help you get objectives and win a couple team fights (assuming you're Lv. 7 compared to their Lv. 5/Additional Talent). Just show them your alpha-ness and make all the calls. Make sure they are going to listen to you.  PS: This isn't League of Legends. You aren't limited to Solo or Duo queue. You're allowed to play in a premade team of 5 with friends or family members. You'll have a much better advantage due to communication.

NexusNewbies,3agvbv,MisterBigStuff,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"The heroes that are considered to have the biggest impact on the game are the damage dealers like Jaina or KT, and of course Illidan who is game changing when well played. Also TLV or Anub are completely overpowered when played well.  However, I love to play bw to carry. I tp to everybody out of position, I heal and shield the shit out of everybody and if it gets bad I increase their movement speed. Keeping everybody alive makes me win about 80% of my games.  Also, maybe more interesting : chu8 is playing on smurf accounts these days so he has to carry against much weaker opponents. Apart from Jaina and Illidan, his most picked heroes are raynor and Kerrigan. Raynor has a huge range, deals a fair amount of damage and can bait easily. Kerrigan is great to gank opponents out of position and her combo is deadly if not dodged. I also use her often with a 70%+ winrate. Nova is also a solid pick to get fed.  Tl;dr : any hero is good if you play it well. Just play the hero you're best with and you will win most of your games if you are better than other players.  Edit : also, matchmaking is not the reason of your winrate. Any good player is able to win 80% of their game at low level, no matter the teammates. You can watch chu8 run to rank 1 in 36 games all solo Q to see what I mean."

NexusNewbies,3adovi,N8CCRG,4,Fri Jun 19 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"How were you with Uther? Having just 1 support you're comfortable on isn't very good, and I personally really like Uther, he can also sort of fill part of the tank role with his stun, which is really great for helping some compositions.  Your Warrior situation is actually an issue, indeed, because Anub'Arak is likely to be picked/banned before your pick, and you don't like Muradin/ETC. If you liked Diablo, then he's fine. He's large and body-blockerish, has displacement, has stun, is tanky.  Illidan 4k, Uther 7k, Diablo 7k, that's 18k gold, and would flesh you out more than just having two more heroes. A melee assassin is not a must, but having just 2 assassins is a bit lacking, especially when Valla is commonly picked.  If I had to pick two and were in your spot, champion only wise? Uther and Jaina, probably. Taking into account which champions you feel uncomfortable on, and that Sylvanas sometimes functions similarly to assassins? Brightwing/Uther and Diablo/Johanna, respectively, because one healer you like and one warrior you like are not enough."
NexusNewbies,3adovi,tundranocaps,3,Fri Jun 19 08:19:49 2015 UTC,Brightwing is a solid choice. Have you tried Lost Vikings or Jaina?
NexusNewbies,3adovi,kirolm,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:38:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Abathur and TLV are two of the hardest acts to play since to play them well, you need to be on top of multiple things (laning and objectives) instead of concentrating on what's needed at the moment."
NexusNewbies,3adovi,anansier,3,Sat Jun 20 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"When you say you don't need another assassin, allow me to disagree. Melee assassins are useful in some setups, you say you liked her and were good with her, i'd say go for Kerrigan ;)"
NexusNewbies,3adovi,elpy2000,3,Fri Jun 19 07:49:09 2015 UTC,"if you want warrior pick up johanna she is strongest tank at the moment imo  for assassin i would suggest jaina if you want burst kt if you want sustained dps both are good and must pick in HL  i really think you should either pick brightwing or uther for support  for specialist since you already have sylvanas, the lost vikings,abathur,zagara are solid choices imo"
NexusNewbies,3adovi,buyusetna,2,Fri Jun 19 07:49:36 2015 UTC,"Brightwing is certainly a good pick. Other than that I'd honestly look into extending your Assassin repertoire a little: Kaelthas and Jaina are both really strong bursty assassins and compared to Raynor and Valla and they fill another niche. Kaelthas is a strong, long-range poking and AoE damage machine, whereas Jaina is probably the burstiest assassin around. Both are 10k though.  Other than those two, Illidan is really strong (once you get comfortable playing him and can dodge skillshots) and quite cheap (4k?) and you don't have a strong melee assassin yet. He's also one of those characters that can solo all merc camps quickly from level 4 onwards, since you play Gazlowe I suspect this might interest you.   If you don't like ETC but you still want another warrior the next best is probably Tyrael, but I'd honestly just buy ETC for 2k since he's so cheap."
NexusNewbies,3adovi,louki,2,Fri Jun 19 07:52:58 2015 UTC,Have u tried Johanna? She's really solid and price dropped to 10k.
NexusNewbies,3adovi,Eriennyl,2,Fri Jun 19 10:18:48 2015 UTC,You need more assasins. As you only have two they can get picked and our team might need more damage. I would suggest Jaina och Kael'thas for damage but they are very squeeze and have no escape (Jaina can get sprint at lv 13 and both can get bolt of the storm at 20). Falstad is also a good pick and can play in a similar way as Valla.  If you are really sure you don't want assassins I would recommend Uther or Brightwing. For warrior ETC or Tyrael. Specialist Zagara or Nazeboo (if you want to have fun Murky!).
NexusNewbies,3adovi,Tralamin,2,Fri Jun 19 12:00:15 2015 UTC,"If you need another support, Brightwing is a lot of fun. You might need another tank too so Diablo for crowd control is quite good for pickoffs."
NexusNewbies,3adovi,nochroot,2,Fri Jun 19 15:27:27 2015 UTC,Brightwing for sure. Maybe Tychus as well or ETC?
NexusNewbies,3adovi,rrrrupp,2,Fri Jun 19 15:36:17 2015 UTC,Kerrigan and Brightwing

NexusNewbies,3advo1,Raishu,7,Fri Jun 19 09:08:27 2015 UTC,"Only defend with terror if you are losing the game and they're pushing hard with a boss/mercs. Terror is a really strong pusher, but sometimes you need to use that advantage to stop them from snowballing into a win. Ideally, you want to use the terror to take down a fort in it's early game lifetime. Later on, you can probably take down 2 if your whole team is pushing for you, or a keep. Use polymorph to keep their healers and tanks disabled while you're team bursts down the fort/keep and chunks (takes lots of health from) their assassins. Try to place your fort disable ability somewhere where the enemy can't just burst it down without putting themselves in danger.  The dragon knight should be used early game to take down towers and walls. The forts give you a damage reduction so unless you are pushing with minions and boss/mercs, you want to take down all the towers first. If you are about to die, run away, the AoE push on death isn't that strong and you can easily be bursted down. Ideally, someone like a specialist takes the DK. If your tank takes it, play safe while he's in DK form and then try a surprise initiate when he goes down. Try not to let your healer take the DK if you are planning on team fighting, as not having your heals means the enemy can be really aggressive. Late game, you want to use DK to push hard and don't be afraid to help bringing down heroes if someone is low and dancing around you. Try to kick heroes into the base if you're losing and away from it if you have an advantage, particularly assassins that can be easily bursted down, or if their tank/healers are channeling.  In short, when you get DK/Terror, try to group around it in concerted pushes, unless a team fight is happening elsewhere, then split push hard if you are far. Rarely is it a good idea to take a Terror/DK to a teamfight unless you're losing hard, mainly because they are so much better used elsewhere."
NexusNewbies,3advo1,kirolm,3,Fri Jun 19 09:53:07 2015 UTC,"This, hands down best us is siege."
NexusNewbies,3advo1,dbsysadmin,3,Fri Jun 19 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"yeah, the dragon knight is good at siege because of its inherent bonus attack damage. The Garden terror doesn't have a bonus but is good at siege because the flower pot"
NexusNewbies,3advo1,nochroot,3,Fri Jun 19 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Just remember that, despite their pushing power, they need a team around them to be most effective. Last night I encountered an enemy Raynor who took the DK and then tried to push top lane by himself. He didn't last very long."
NexusNewbies,3advo1,cloral,2,Fri Jun 19 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"Another nice use of the Garde Terror is to keep running from lane to lane, droping flower pots  near forts/towers/keeps. If the enemy team does not follow you, keep bashing the fort. If they try to fight you, run with your E, drop polymorphs behind you and go to another lane.  This will keep them running around while you and your flower pots do siege damage and your team might be pushing somewhere else (or taking the neutral garden terror, for example)."
NexusNewbies,3advo1,polakovoador,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"For either your main goal is going to be to push a lane, ideally with your team or split if they can handle the enemy team without you. Obviously certain circumstances will dictate how you go about this and if you want to push as hard as possible or play it safe.   With the Garden Terror the thing to keep in mind is just that this is a large map and you're starting from your base. This gives you a little more flexibility in deciding what to do. If the enemy team is in your base, or pushing with their own terror it's not a bad idea to use it defensively. The polymorph can be a great asset to help clear the enemy team. Also, if it's still night when you take it you could always help clear the last neutral garden terror and deny seeds for the enemy team. I'd avoid looking for a fight though, since it is such a strong pushing tool. If the enemy team gets the jump on you, dash away and drop the polymorph as you go. You can do it in a bush as you pass through to try and trap them."
NexusNewbies,3advo1,productivealt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:23:09 2015 UTC,Terror is good for team fighting later on. You should focus on sieging with it though (i.e. You'll want to be pushing a fort and dropping the seed a lot). DK should always be used for sieging.
NexusNewbies,3advo1,rrrrupp,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"With the Garden Terror its best to push unless the enemy team is in your base or there's a large team fight when you're moving towards their base. Once you get to their gates, lay out the plant (I think its the W?) right in between all of the structures. If you plant it right, you can hit 3 towers, the gate and the fortress with it. At that point you go one of two ways: 1)If the enemy team is not around/defending, destroy everything and keep your plant active. It does MASSIVE damage to structures. 2)If the enemy group is defending and you're in the early game you're going to get killed pretty quickly. What I do is place the plant in between all of the structures and then sprint over to the next lane. There i'll beat up on a tower until my CDs are up and i'll drop another plant. If enemy team has moved to where I am, I again sprint over to the next lane and drop a plant in between the structures. Some people are succesful at doing this on all three lanes though I'd advise against it starting out.  The dragon knight should also be used to push lanes, but hes really good at clearing out enemies as well."
NexusNewbies,3adm5b,omgitsjavi,2,Fri Jun 19 06:49:53 2015 UTC,"They all stack, additively though, 40% increased + 30% increased = 70% increased from base, rather than 1.4 * 1.3. At least that's what I heard, and didn't test myself, though I guess I should."
NexusNewbies,3adm5b,tundranocaps,2,Fri Jun 19 07:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is correct, I went ahead and tested it myself, ha. This is true for Focused Attack, Searing Attacks, Assassin's Blade, and Nexus Blades; both separately and together, they calculate bonus damage from base.  Altogether that's 270% attack damage on the first crit, and 195% for 5 seconds afterwards. Not too shabby."
NexusNewbies,3adm5b,dizzyMongoose,2,Fri Jun 19 07:53:39 2015 UTC,"While we're talking about auto attacks, note that Seasoned Marksman adds directly to the base attack damage, so it stacks multiplicatively with the percentage attack boosters, as well as Vampire Assault. On the other hand, Giant Killer procs separately, so it will not be affected by attack boosters."

NexusNewbies,3ae133,Ghash,5,Fri Jun 19 10:31:26 2015 UTC,"It varies from map to map.  You should always be trying ""soaking"" exp in the early game (1-9),  and only leaving to take map objectives.  Some maps, like sky temple, have really strong objectives that it is worth leaving your lane for, whereas others it might be worth it more to stay in your lane and soak up experience for your team.  Once you hit 10, you can start to look at roaming with your team. You only need to split up and soak in lanes again if you fall 3 or more levels behind.   Your team might also want to split push a lot rather than engage in teamfights. It comes down to what your team wants to do from the midgame on, but generally you should try to stick with your team and do what they are doing."
NexusNewbies,3ae133,MinhD,4,Fri Jun 19 11:01:57 2015 UTC,This. Always keep in mind that no matter how appealing it is to try and over extend or roam early game to kill opponents you are always guaranteed xp from minions if you don't get zoned out. You can do more damage to the opposing team most times by zoning them out of xp.
NexusNewbies,3ae133,dbsysadmin,2,Fri Jun 19 11:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, level 1-9.  Level 10 is when things change because you get your heroic abilities and can generally team fight."
NexusNewbies,3ae133,MinhD,2,Fri Jun 19 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"If you see an empty lane at the start of the game and nobody has said they are going there, then absolutely go there. Especially in quick match games can snowball easily if a team gets a solid level advantage. Once you are level 10 always try to be with your team unless the plan is for your hero to split push and the team is agreed on your plan."
NexusNewbies,3ae133,hacdladf1,2,Fri Jun 19 16:22:17 2015 UTC,"1) You should be killing minions in lane up until level 10, unless an objective needs you to leave (tribute, mines, temple, etc).  2) Yes, there should be 1 hero in each lane, who is within a half-screen from where they minions are dying to earn XP.   Yes, Zagarra is an amazing solo lane hero and is very strong early.   *Yes, regardless if who you are playing, if there is an empty lane someone needs to be there.  Keep in mind in the first 10 levels You should focus on clearing minions and zonig out enemies.  Don't chase hero kills.  If you can safely force someone to leave and heal and lose XP while you keep soaking you are doing your job.  Keep in mind, unless trying a lane push strategy, you should be helping your team with objectives, even in the early game.  After level 10, you are better served by supporting your team and sticking together in most cases."
NexusNewbies,3ae133,bsmntdwlr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"All lanes should be covered until around level 10 and you should only group up for objectives (DEFINITELY pursue the objectives over laning).

NexusNewbies,3aajbq,drpestilence,6,Thu Jun 18 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"Diablo is a pretty fun tank imo. Personally I like to use his trait boosting talents to make him extremely tanky to where he can easily have over 6k hp. Diablo is meant to help his team. he isnt meant to solo merc camps and things like that. Whta he does is disrupt the enemy team by throwing enemies out of position. The main combo is using over pwer (E) to toss enemy behind you and then Shadow charge (Q) to push them far back.  This allows you to throw an enemy into the mid of your team. It gets better though. Diablo can also over power enemies neart the gate of towers into the base where they cannot escape and get obliterated by cannons. He is good at peeling as well. In other words, if a team mate with little hp is being chased you can over power or shadow charge the enemy away. His fire stomp atack is good for some aoe dmg and lightning breath is a fun ult. He can be built to do more damage however as he has plenty of talents to make fire stomp a very dangerous move.   If yo have ever played magic the gathering, Diablo feels a lot like a green and blue combo: Tanky with lots of control"

If someone rages at you for QM picks, fuck them just mute them, they won't contribute anything anyway if they're busy raging over QM picks. HL is a different story, it's drafted and competitive so people get overly upset about certain picks. In a perfect world people wouldn't rage and would just try to make their comp work and work as a team, but oh well. You shouldn't have to limit yourself to AI games just because people are douchebags though :)"

Keep your eyes on the minimap and Phase into teamfights at the last possible second (you will get an idea of when that is the more you play).  Soak as much as you can and be aggressive in the early laning phase because it takes 2+ people to push her out of lane due to great starting autoattack damage, passive heals, and solid poke (Q)."

NexusNewbies,3abaal,perfectm,5,Thu Jun 18 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"Gazlowe, Chen, and Stitches are all pretty bad and have very low winrates. LiLi is bad at a high level but she's new player friendly and can be pretty good at lower levels. Some heroes like Tassadar and Muradin are good but have low winrates because they depend on their team comp playing correctly. Heroes like Anubarak, Jaina, KT, Valla, Brightwing, Johanna, Illidan (late game centric and often depends on team so can be frustrating at low levels. Also has a very high skill cap) and Sylvanas are pretty universally good. Certainly a few I'm forgetting. Hotslogs.com is a great resource for checking all these statistics out. Play what you enjoy though :)"
NexusNewbies,3abaal,pirateflavor,2,Thu Jun 18 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"The real answer is no. Unless you're playing at the highest echelons of competitive tournaments, tier lists or best/worst comparisons are ridiculous and actively unhelpful.   Try playing as many different heroes as you can and see who you are best with. Your ability to effectively use the hero is WAY more important than Hero League win rates."
NexusNewbies,3abaal,drunkengeebee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any TERRIBLE heroes but some are very difficult to play as, especially for a beginner (such as abathur). If you are looking for easy to play and good heroes I suggest: ETC, Li Li, Jaina, and Valla to start. You are a lot of them even at higher levels and they are all relatively easy to play. Out of those LiLi would probably be my favorite."

Of course YMMV and you may find you're better with a lower tier hero, making that lower tier hero actually a better pick for you.

If so, there's your issue, and it is likely on Blizzard's side. About a week and a half ago I believe they put out a notice saying they were working on it. If there isn't that icon, I don't know what to tell ya. Most of your gold will come from quests. It'll probably take just over a week for 10k, at least it did for me. In the mean time, experiment with the weekly free rotation. You will be able to play more free heroes as you level up. Also level every free hero to level 5, you get 500 gold for your trouble each time. I haven't been playing long enough to know about sales, sorry.     Make sure you really like playing a hero before you buy. On top of that, only really buy heroes when their free rotation ends and you miss them. Playing the objective is crucial, as is communication. I've been on many huge comebacks due to communication coming around. Learn a hero in Training mode, master them in Quick Match, then take them into Leagues. Experiment with builds! The meta and tiers constantly fluctuate, so any hero can be amazing in the right hands.   Any other questions? Happy to help!"

NexusNewbies,3acqvv,Epicthunder25,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"1) The graphical demands of this game seem really low to me, however, FPS seems to be tied to internet performance so any time your connection lags hard you will drop to sometimes less than 1fps chop that will cripple you.  you can turn on a performance monitor with crtl-alt-f (i think, going from memory here) and watch your current frames and other statistics  2) I would suggest not buying anything until you are level 30 or 40.  by that time you will likely have 30-50K gold saved up and will  have a good handle on what characters you really want to buy and will use effectively.  Also, i would suggest considering one of the bundles if you really find yourself liking the game.  They are reletively inexpensive and give you starting point.  if you wait till later to buy a bundle you may also already own some of the heroes which is kind of a bummer.  I find it easy to earn 20-30K per month, but I use stim packs and i play quite heavilly  3) sales rotate weekly and will be 1 hero, 1 skin and 1 (additional skin OR mount).  launch specials were doubled.  4) Subscribe to TGN squadron and MFPallyTime on youtube."

NexusNewbies,3abdd1,BishopDMJ,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Yes I just tested it, the cooldown is around 2-3 sec. The max attack speed when you build for that is above 8. You should have 720 APM to properly stutterstep at that speed :)"

NexusNewbies,3ac8xc,Suicidal_Inspirant,0,Fri Jun 19 15:44:51 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. Splitpushing azmo is a dead azmo. You can push globally with your passive and the range on your Q. But you should be at fights.

NexusNewbies,3a9y6k,Cabamacadaf,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:21:15 2015 UTC,"Actually Valla can deal with Illidan (and I had a couple of really nice duels with him), especially after taking searing attacks. Just wait for him to pop evasion and then turn it on. You should still always watch your positioning, it's the main thing when playing Valla as well as many other ranged assassins."
NexusNewbies,3a9y6k,blergh_1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:32:40 2015 UTC,Searing attacks go through evasion? I never knew this.
NexusNewbies,3a9y6k,kamimaiku,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:16:08 2015 UTC,"they don't you wait till he pops it and after 2s you pop searing.  also you can deal with him as a team by focusing healer instead of illidan, since he does not do too much burst and you can try to kill/zone healer and then switch to illi since he can be quite elusive and hard to kill between evasion heals from healer and meta dodge"

NexusNewbies,3a9y6k,polakovoador,3,Thu Jun 18 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"As Jaina, I usually just mash all the buttons and its a close match (depends on talents / level / skill of the illidan player).  If its past 13, just sprint away. If you have Ice Block, just freeze yourself and call for help."
NexusNewbies,3a9y6k,StarrkDreams,2,Thu Jun 18 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"Well, running from illidan hardly ever works, unless you're close to a fort or to friends. Your best bet might be just trade with him and hope you can burst him down faster than he can heal"

If I were you I'd pick who you want to play as (assuming there is a slot for him on the team, so if you are last pick and still no support, please pick a support), and if you play him well and your team wins they won't cafe.

First one is to not change anything and continually get frustrated. You probably don't want to do that. Second is to start out in the game by being friendly, toss out a few hey, how are you, gl hf, that sort of thing. That way people know you're not an ass and won't be an ass to them so they'll be less hesitant about talking. You don't want to outright say ""I'm not a jerk."" because that's gonna seem desperate and you're going to seem like one. This is a mediocre option. The third and best in my mind is to add friends who communicate. If someone talks to you in game and responds to pings, then whisper them after the game and see if they want to play more and possibly add you. Also, in the main Heroes subreddit there's a thread each week where people can post to find people to play with."
NexusNewbies,3a97bq,hacdladf1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:06:35 2015 UTC,"I've made a habit of always starting every game with a glhf.

NexusNewbies,3a97bq,gooblaster17,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's a good habit. I've long since given up playing quick match alone because I still get games where someone refuses to coordinate or simply ignores everything and does what they want. Also was no stranger to people who are just flat out terrible at the game. I felt that avoiding playing solo is the only solution. Sure getting a 5 man group of people you know can be tough, but just playing with 2 or 3 man groups is good too. It will limit the amount of random people on your team, so the other team will have 5 potential people who don't play with the team while yours only has 2. Finding one person who often plays the same hours as you would be ideal. They will have friends who in turn become your friends and you can play with them and just keep expanding your friend list. Don't be afraid to add them, the worst they could do is just decline it.   Another option is the lfg channel in game or just clicking the looking for party button. I had some decent experiences with those before I had a large enough friend list that there was someone to play with most of the time."

NexusNewbies,3a8t5j,BlackSparkz,3,Thu Jun 18 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer these as best as I can:   It's honestly pretty fluid. Some strats like 4-1 on Mines, 2-2-1 Sky Temple are more set than others, but as long as you coordinate, you can make it work. Just won a game where we went 1-3-1 on Shire, which I don't know if that's actually the ""meta."" Going off-meta on certain maps can be incredibly helpful in catching opponents off guard, but you should still be sensitive to the map objectives when deciding laning. Also, you tend to rotate earlier in HotS as well, so it's not like you stay in a static laning formation for too long. Sort of. At least for SoloQing HL, you'll want to have a decent balance of supports/assassins/warriors, so if you get stuck with a role, you can reasonably function with it. You could probably get by with 2-2-6 in terms of your least preferred roles to your most preferred, but I think 3-3-4 is preferable just to ensure you don't get picked out of your only options. Incredibly important, but not the end-all-be-all. You can, in fact, win on Cursed Hollow without getting a single Tribute, but it requires coordination. But if you adhere to the map-specific objective like at Bay, collect coins, attack/defend the dropoff zone, then you can snowball the game incredibly quickly and win in 15min. In general, objectives require coordination with your teammates. Taking Merc Camps are also important objectives that can compensate for losing an objective or help you press your advantage further. Really, just try heros and buy them if you like them. There are ""typical"" powerhouses like Brightwing, Sylvanas, Kael'thas, Jaina, Uther, that are more expensive, but there's plenty of cheap powerhouses, such as Anub'arak, Illidan, Valla, Muradin. Sales only impact real money value, not the gold coin. Similar to LoL. Playing HL gives you more than QM which gives you more than vs AI. Couldn't tell you people tend to not speak in chat. I usually try to write ""glhf"" or something, if people at the start of the game get a bit of talking going I tend to find that coordination down the road is easier and I've tended to win more when that happens. I don't think there's an organized league. Random tourneys here and there, mostly. EU and NA have developing scenes while Korea and China have really young scenes. I'd go to http://www.gosugamers.net/heroesofthestorm/rankings#team for more info."
NexusNewbies,3a8t5j,egumption,2,Thu Jun 18 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"Each map has it's own meta, however, depending on your composition, this can change. For example, in Haunted Mines, you usually want 4 on offense on the side your Skull Golem will spawn so you can push. However, if they have a strong split pusher, you want to defend. But if the enemy uses this to send their team to offense, you can switch to offense to and base rush it. What level are they? What level are you? What's their pushing power? Will they have to overcommit? Can you set up a trap? Meta is nice but there are so many moving parts that you just have to know the maps and adapt adapt adapt. Meta is changing a lot, and there is no set in stone composition. However, having one of each role is incredibly useful, though specialists are sometimes replaced by a second assassin or warrior. Support is super important, and unless built specifically to exist without it, most compositions need some sort of sustain / heals / shielding. One person stays in each lane for the first 8-9 levels. After that, the XP from map objectives and kills becomes more significant. The rest can roam and rotate around the map helping push waves and get kills, map control, etc. Map objectives > forts > mercs > kills Whatever hero you like and can get good at. Top tier heroes change constantly, can fall down with a patch, and if you don't like it, you won't be playing it. If you're buying with gold, anyone who isn't 15k or 10k is probably going to stay that way for a while. Cash wise, the Starter Bundle is prety solid. You get a 7 day 150% XP boost / 100% gold boost for getting to player Lv. 10. You can also buy boosts. Playing with a friend is another 50%, and for the next week there's a flat 100% boost for everyone. They do, but you have to initiate, and some people are more comfortable communicating with pings, which is actually more feature-ful than you'd think. The pro scene is pretty big. Lots of support from Blizzard. There's a $500k prize for Blizzcon tournament, iirc. The same leagues that hold tournaments for the other MOBAs are starting to have a HotS category. Comparable but slightly smaller to your average League competitions. Changes on the region and whatnot, but a lot of familiar names (Team Liquid, C9, Fnatic, etc.) No clue who that is. No idea. There are just different maps. Game mode is the same. 5 on 5 vs nexus."
NexusNewbies,3a8t5j,kirolm,2,Thu Jun 18 04:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm also from LoL, and I've leveled up to 38 now. What I've learned so far about HOTS:   Objectives are priority. Whichever team bullies shrines more effectively wins. Farming/Soaking is still important, but games are shorter (think ARAM or Twisted Treeline). Ganks are much more common, so grouping up for protection happens sooner. I think chat is off by default, though pings should be enough to effectively coordinate. Even so, there are plenty of HOTS and LoL players who don't read, speak another language, or otherwise play their own solo game, getting ganked constantly and failing to protect objectives. Assuming the HOTS and LoL subreddit activity is representative samples of their respective player bases, HOTS is a smaller community."

NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,sunsetter,2,Thu Jun 18 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, I tried one of the answers from the ""I got 3 dragons in a row, still lost"" thread. The suggestion was never beat on a tower while in range of another tower. I tried this out last night and boy what a difference. You can attack a wall tower while standing off to the side so the other wall tower cant hit you. Additionally you can attack every structure in a lane without being in range of that lane's fort/keep (since fort/keep attacks slow your movement speed AND attack speed) .. I was kind of amazed how much HP this saves and contributes to a good Dragon Knight run."
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,nightshiftb,4,Thu Jun 18 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"Well what problems are you having?    Getting DK is obviously the big objective and the quickest way to win, but getting it and then using it effectively requires a lot of team coordination, and everyone needs to rotate down or up to secure a shrine where needed.    If you're up top solo and you see two coming to take the top shrine, obviously you need to leave and help your team secure bottom and/or retake top.  Harass where you can, but being dead doesn't help anyone.  If your team loses the fight at bottom, you need to move to middle to harass the DK activation as long as possible.  Your goal is to get the DK, but preventing them from getting DK can be just as effective in winning the game.  When you get DK, for the love of shit don't push until you have at least half of your team with you.  Run behind your tower if you have to, DK isn't a time limit, you have it until your health runs out.  Don't attack other heroes with DK, you should only be kicking heroes out of the way if your teammates won't be able to kill them.  Your job in the DK is to attack structures, because you can chop up a fort in half a dozen swings.  If you don't get the DK, your job is to hang out in front of it and kill the dudes doing damage to him.  Pretend the DK is your healer and you need to protect him.  Use your stuns on assassins (first) and healers (second), and chew up the other guys.  The same rules of normal team fighting apply, if it's you and DK versus three others, you both need to fuck off to another lane or back up until your team regroups to push.  If you're against the DK, your job is to do damage to it as much as you can - and try to stay behind him, so he has to interrupt beating up your forts to kick you across the map.  Try to prevent DK from moving forward at all costs - put a ring of zombies around him, have Sonya crater, whatever it takes.  Keep that thing from getting to your goodies.  If you're losing a lot on Dragonshire, it's because your team isn't coordinating.  On most of the other maps, you can carry your team quite a bit by beating down objectives by yourself (capturing temples and beating up the dog dudes, collecting tributes, gathering dubloons/skulls/gems), but Dragonshire requires your team to do two separate things at the same time before you can do a third thing, and the other team is competing for the same space.  If they're coordinating better than your team, you're going to lose every time.  Make it clear to your team at the load that when those shrines pop, they need to drop everything and get to the closest one to hold the position."

NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,sStarz1779,2,Thu Jun 18 16:03:11 2015 UTC,"1 top, 1 mid, 3 bot lane is the normal setup. If they put more people in the mid or top, they'll never control the bottom. Eventually they'll send more down and you can take the top shrine. Keep someone in every lane to soak xp until at least level ten. Don't get discouraged if you can't hold a shrine. Chances are it means that your team can hold the other one. Just focus on keeping a bigger team than them at one of the shrines and get everyone together for a team fight if they group up to take a shrine."
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,RogueT3ch,2,Thu Jun 18 02:33:26 2015 UTC,"A few tips.   Don't attack Forts with your DK unless that is the only thing left to attack. Kill the towers (and walls if you can while in the scuffle), then move on to the next set of towers. Forts give you a damage reduction, so unless you have minions pushing, it is going to make your DK has as effective as it could be. DK happens very quickly. The channel to get the DK is only about a second and a half. This isn't about having complete control of the map. It's about snagging both shrines at just the right time so you can have someone sneak mid and grab it. Don't roam as a death ball or you will have the enemy team sneak the other shrine constantly until your death ball stops working because you split and you will be easy pickings. Use your merc camps wisely. Grabbing a merc when everyone is up and nobody is pushing means it's probably just going to get killed before it does any damage. Get your camps according to what you want to do with your DK. Their top is all the way up? Get top mercs and push with DK. Top and bottom are up? Get top mercs, rush bot with DK to get a split push. Their squishy is on your side of the wall trying to burst you down? Kick them into the middle of the map and have your team pick them off. At 10% and their Fort is over 25% HP? Back off. Don't have your healer take DK. Don't have your healer take DK. Don't have your healer take DK. Don't have your healer take DK."
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,kirolm,2,Thu Jun 18 04:47:02 2015 UTC,"Don't attack Forts with your DK unless that is the only thing left to attack    If you are not in pressure then attack the stuff around the fort, but if you are pushing 5v5 then you will 99% of the time go for the fort or keep, killing a tower is like standing around with the DK, it is extremely important to either have full pressure on the DK or your team. IF on the DK then your team will be able to poke and get heroes out of position, if they decide to say ""fuck the DK"" and go for team, well you dont want to waste your time killing towers when you could easily pick off a KEEP! Killing a Keep puts all the pressure on you, if not then they will have plenty of time to re-engage you once they have 5v4'ed your team :O  also early Dks can be taken by the healer because you are going to be split pushing during the laning phase anyway."
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,OrganzdChaos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:31:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on the DK.  Your first DK, taking down 6 T1 towers gives you way more map control than taking down 2 T1 towers and a keep. (edit: fort)"
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,kirolm,2,Thu Jun 18 13:55:30 2015 UTC,"The first line is a fort, the 2nd line is a keep. also it would be nearly impossible to take down 6 towers because of the short time limit, i was also mentioning that it would be a later DK. because good luck getting a keep with the first one early on"
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,OrganzdChaos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:00:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, and I mean, if you've been trying to push down one of your lanes, using DK with a group of 3, you can have someone split push 2 towers while DK takes down 4.

The deathball that is so powerful in maps like Mines and Garden just doesn't work here, and just being good at teamfights will never be enough. If you can pick before you know the map, go for a duelist, and avoid most supports and warriors. If you have to pick sup or war, go for one capable of dueling effectively - Tyrael and Tassadar come to mind. The most powerful heroes on this map are Nova, Zeratul, Falstad and Illidan because of how great they are at skirmishes and duels, and how quickly they can sneak a dragon. Nazeebo gets an honorable mention because of his amazing ability to zone."
NexusNewbies,3a8hq3,TheLolomancer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:33:13 2015 UTC,"The first thing to understand about Dragon Shire is that the whole point of the map is not to capture the dragon knight, it's to control the dragon knight.  If you capture and hold a single shrine, you may not cap the Dragon Knight, but neither will the other team.  So long as you soak all 3 lanes and hold absolute control of one shrine the other team cant cap the DK.   Ok, but what then?  Well, you playing ""keep away"" will usually force the enemy team to take action.  If they pull people out of lanes to try and cap the other shrine you will get an XP lead.  If they pull people from the shrine they hold you can counter-cap their shrine.  Usually, if they are wildly rotating lanes you can also force picks on people out of position to get an XP lead off kills.  If they mirror you for the stalemate you can push camps and overwhelm a lane, forcing a response.  In short, Dragon Shire is the most interesting map because you control when the objective happens.... which is huge.  At the end of the day, if your team can be patient and soak lanes without feeding against uneven odds, you will have a real good shot at exploiting your advantage in the long term."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,red_spooks,12,Wed Jun 17 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"E also gives a speed boost.  It's perfect for when your assassins over extend a bit, you can block an attack and help them escape.  It's also nice to toss on your tank in the middle of a fight.    Your passive heals everyone around you every 4 seconds.  Get the level 7 talent where you can activate an extra gust with 'D', this can be huge.  Level 4 talent to shield is very good too.    For Blinkheal try to understand what people are doing and where they want to go, if you think they'll die even if you heal them then don't!  Only heal if you think both of you can get out alive.  A nice combo is to blink to the tank, then polymorph whoever is wailing on him, then bink out to one of your ranged characters.    Brightwing is all about map awareness and knowing where people are going, and who you can help out the best.  Just keep trying!"
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,andraes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:06:13 2015 UTC,I have been enjoying the teleportie aspect so much I think I'm sold on the 10 bucks for the unlock.
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,drpestilence,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"Sounds like something that'd be better to try at once I'm a bit better at the game.  Still, thanks to yours and everyone else's advice, I think I can get through brightwing free week :D"
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,pbpope,2,Thu Jun 18 00:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'm fascinated by different players' approaches to the different Heroes. I played the game for 2-3 weeks and felt frustrated with it before trying out the support role and falling in love. Then I spent several weeks just playing the free Heroes (mainly Li Li, Malfurion and Rehgar) before there was a sale on Bwing and I took the plunge and picked her up. For me, it was a revelation. For whatever reason, her play style just clicked with me and I went from a decent support to outhealing everyone I went up against.   Like Andreas said, using your Blink Heal as both a snap heal and an escape is a great thing. The E gives a decent little speed boost that can mean the difference between life and death for you, your teammates, or even an enemy Hero (when they're about to escape, that little extra speed can be just the extra bit needed for a friendly Hero to close the game and get the kill). Combine that with Sprint at Tier 5 and you have multiple escape options."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,RemusShepherd,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"She seems to have fairly serious mana problems.  In my two games trying her out so far, I never felt that I had enough mana to waste my E as a speed boost.  This makes BW the slowest support ever, and you will be last to every fight until she gets her teleport at level 10.  So far, I'm not a fan."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,CrashingTheInternets,5,Wed Jun 17 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Your Z (Mount) is another teleport, so you shouldn't be the last one to a fight. That is one reason Brightwing is really good. You can be anywhere on the map when needed."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,drunkengeebee,7,Wed Jun 17 20:42:05 2015 UTC,"If you look around and no one needs you for the second (no PvP is happening right this second), hearth back to base and mana up then warp to a teammate. This only takes five extra seconds, but makes your up time way better."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,pbpope,3,Wed Jun 17 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"While she does run out of mana fairly quickly, she can also recharge and be back in a fight in 10-15 seconds max, as long as there's another Hero nearby your original location. Just B back to base, recharge mana, then Z back to the Hero at your original location."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,andraes,2,Thu Jun 18 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"It is easy to run out of mana with her.  I usually use W very rarely unless I get the slow talent with it.  As for wasting it, I feel like as a support I'm supposed to keep my team a live, and if I can do that by speed-boosting them out of trouble, then it was mana well spent."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,rrrrupp,4,Wed Jun 17 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"BW is incredibly hard to kill once you're good with her. Use dust on yourself for the speed boost when you aren't teleporting to someone. Also use it on your self for the speed boost to retreat. Another great use is on a low HP ally who needs to retreat. It's best for the speed boost, not the block.  Blink heal is amazing. Yes, it can put you in harms way but it has 2 charges. Blink in, blink out. Don't forget you can teleport to friendly minions to get out of dodge quick.  It's a must pick at level 7 to pick the gust of healing talent. It heals SO MUCH it's pretty much impossible to die when it's going off.   Personally, I LOVE it when the team focuses on me (unless I got in really poor position) because I can easily kite the team while not dying."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,henrax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"Focus bw is clearly a bad call, she has one of the best survivability in the game."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,rrrrupp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:11:32 2015 UTC,Unless she's out of position and you know her cooldowns on her heroics are up (hard if she has blink heal but easier if she took wind).  The one benefit of targeting BW is that she can't really heal herself outside of a possible shield talent or the level 7 talent that has a minute cool down.
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,henrax,2,Wed Jun 17 18:58:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking about a bw with shield and tp heroic (the best of the two imo). She also can get 20% faster and avoid two aa. And if she has the talent that improves her trait she can heal quickly. A bw game with zero death is quite usual if you don't get too bold or try to save doomed teammates.
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,rrrrupp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:07:02 2015 UTC,Haha very true on that last part. I'm still learning when I can save someone or not. I sometimes teleport into a horrible situation thinking I can save them only to have both of us die :) I'm horrible at just letting someone die.
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,henrax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:05:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't worry most people are. Especially when you know that it's going to be followed by a ""OMG bw why no heal ? ffs"". Well my dear Illidan, if you didn't jump 1v3 for no reason you would still be alive.  Support is a cold-hearted role."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,SmokeSerpent,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:11:45 2015 UTC,Yeah it's rare for me to have more than one death in a game where I am running BW
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,Kandiru,3,Wed Jun 17 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"You can talent your E to also block 50% of ability damage. This lets you save people from Pyroblasts etc.  You should try using the Emerald Wind R, it lets you have a lot of control in team fights by pushing away and damaging your enemies. Blink Heal is good, Emerald Wind is also good. They are very different abilities."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,henrax,3,Wed Jun 17 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"All the other advices here are very good. I would just like to add that one of the main aspect of BW is map control. You have to know all the time who is doing what, who is fighting who and where you are needed. Use your tp when it's useful (you should be in every fight) but don't waste it. Also don't roam, always do something productive (soak, bribe merc) and tp at the right time."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,Lyramion,3,Wed Jun 17 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"I have like 70% brightwing winrate and I somehow find picking myself some Talents most guides don't have as their No#1 choice:   Sticky Powder Sticky Flare Emerald Wind   I never feel the need of Sprint and Iceblock. The massive slows usually allow me to escape anyway. However they are useful in chasing after a won fight and get more ahead.  Many people just read ""Push Back"" on the Emerald wind Ult. However you can also use this to seperate the enemy team so you can focus down 1-2 heroes without the rest being able to instantly help. Also during the push back animation the enemy heroes can't act resulting in a 1 second stun that often wins teamfights.  I feel the secret to Brightwing is all about spacing. You want to be close enough to max your passive healing AoE on your team. However you want to be far enough away to not get cought in wombo combos and be able to use your Polymorph to cancel channels.  At the start of the game look at the enemy team and analyse who has the stuns. If you fight against heroes with no stuns you can always phase shift away and create space by them chasing you."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,pbpope,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"I almost never take any of the talents you listed, always take Sprint and have a 72% QM win rate and 80% in HL with Bwing. That said, I absolutely love your thoughts on Emerald Wind and will be thinking about taking it in upcoming matches.   I think it's a testament to the Hero that there can be such successful build diversity. It's very cool."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,perperub,2,Thu Jun 18 17:22:52 2015 UTC,I love playing BW. I'm so eager to kill so I play her almost like an assassin.  Do you guys think BW is TOO strong? Is the nerf hammer coming?
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,Ltwizard,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"There are suggestions that she passively heals double the tooltip amount, but I'm uncertain if the tooltip will be corrected, or the hero nerfed.  She does have a very high win percent globally, so it's likely at some point in the future, but it's also possible that other heroes will just be bought up, considering a few have existed since early closed beta without many changes."
NexusNewbies,3a62xf,SmokeSerpent,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:26:54 2015 UTC,Right now in QM few people know how to deal with Brightwing. I only started playing him because I needed it for a daily and I'm coming to love him. I think in a few days people will have a good handle on how to take him out though and it may become less fun. He can solo most camps easily and does great in the Haunted Mines if you're stuck in a match where no one's going in.  You want to time your polymorphs and use them to prevent combos and OP support spells for the most part. Emerald Wind and polymorph are a good way to slow the momentum of a push and he has enough range to really help in team battles. His heals and shields aren't that great but his other denial skills make up for it.

NexusNewbies,3a62xf,Magravan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"My build is typically Bribe > Envenom if we need damage, shield if we need mitigation > Gust of Wind > Emerald Wind instead of the teleport heal > Sprint > Critterize > Emerald Wind v2, Group shield if I need the mitigation. As for playing BW, I play her as an aggressive support. I self heal, so it's in my best interest to make them spend mana to try to kill me, so long as I survive. That's how I trade advantageously.  On any map where it makes sense to farm until the fight starts, I send my lanemate to the objective and hold in lane for as long as possible before teleporting to them with Z so that I can soak that last little bit of xp, but still be part of the teamfight.  When possible, I always try to B before porting to people so that I can get my mana back for the impending battle. If someone is where I want to be, my Z is up and I'm low on mana, I'll go back and then just come back to lane for the free recharge.  Remember that Alt-E = Self boost without having to target yourself, and Alt-2 (if you built Bribe > Shield) will self shield you. Combining these with Poly / Sprint / Emerald Wind, and you're a pain in the butt to chase if they don't have hard CC.   I had a lot of trouble with her at first, but now she's probably my favourite support. She definitely takes some getting used to, but once you put in the time, she's so much fun.  Some relevant information: http://www.heroesfire.com/hots/guide/brightwing-your-entrails-are-tasty-4294   Also, Sneaky Bribes. Once you get 2 stacks of Bribe, be on the lookout for any uncapped golems. This is ESPECIALLY great in maps like Cursed Hallow if you can nail your opponents' golems just as the countdown timer for a Tribute comes up on the other side of the map.    The last HL game I played, I had a Tychus that I was pretending to be delaying, but secretly I wanted to cap his golems without risk.. So I just futzed around until he had to make the call between wasting his time with me or being able to contest the tribute.   He bailed, so I grabbed his Golems, and then teleported to the teamfight just in time to polymorph him as he came storming in. We got the tribute, the golems doing uncontested damage in their base, and an easy kill on Tychus."
NexusNewbies,3a8l4e,MysterySteve,3,Thu Jun 18 02:11:46 2015 UTC,"I have found choosing the right hero during draft to be as important how you play in game. You need to learn tier lists, what heroes counter what, what heroes are good on what maps. If you're picking heroes that are easily countered (lili and chen by cc, Sgt hammer or vikings when there's a kael, nova and not many squishy heroes on enemy team) or just picking heroes that hardly ever win in HL (Gazlow, Murky) or going up against 2 tanks and a support and you're all assassins you're going to have a hard time winning.  I recommend watching popular rank 1 players on twitch for a while."
NexusNewbies,3a8l4e,swartkrans,2,Thu Jun 18 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"I have a fairly reasonable handle on what heroes are top tier and some of the more obvious counter-picks (hammer and kael, illidan and brightwing etc). Honestly, most of the time the drafts are reasonable as far as role diversity goes - And yet, things always seem one-sided."
NexusNewbies,3a8l4e,swartkrans,2,Thu Jun 18 03:43:20 2015 UTC,Are you dying a lot? Do you usually have the most deaths on the team?  Are you usually where the team is at critical times? Do you find yourself alone often?
NexusNewbies,3a8l4e,swartkrans,0,Thu Jun 18 04:35:04 2015 UTC,"nope, usually have the fewest deaths and I'm present during teamfights. Sometimes I think my hero damage is too light if I'm playing a DPS class but I genuinely think I'm alright at the game based on my QM experience. I put out like 120APM in StarCraft, I understand the basic principles of positional play from RTS. It honestly feels like something's not right from a systems POV, but who knows."
NexusNewbies,3a8l4e,m_takeshi,4,Thu Jun 18 04:44:49 2015 UTC,Watch the replays. See what went wrong. There are usually a couple of key things you might notice. When did xp become uneven? In team fights who's health dropped first? Who was getting cc'ed? What was the enemy doing differently? Look at talent choices. There's a reason why one team wins and another one loses. You just have to find that and learn from it.  Also check hotslog to see who your opponents were and what their MMR was and what their match history was. At the end of the game hover over their nicks in the score screen and see if they were in a party.
NexusNewbies,3a8l4e,OrganzdChaos,3,Thu Jun 18 12:30:54 2015 UTC,"Just to add a little: watch the replays with an honest goggles. Its hard and heartbreaking at times, but it's to me the best method to self improve."

Im guessing you will have laning issues, map awareness problems, not knowing what to do next (shot calling), and not the best team fighter (esp higher levels i see this ALL the time, which i figured out when playing the highest level teams like symbiote. I see this all the time when i play and most people dont even realize that they are playing extremely sub-optimally.   You can have a player think they are doing well ""Oh i got most hero damage and fewest deaths! i must be the best player on my team"" That is what i thought early on, and you know what, it is extremely incorrect. One, there are only a few assassins in each game to begin with, and some naturally do more than others, two some heroes should die more than others given certain circumstances, like if you are playing vs a high burst comp and you have no front line - your squishy back line is going to get fucked over.

Lots of games during my loss streaks the other team was obviously a 4/5-stack, and the people on my team.. well sometimes I feel like even an AI would be better.

I had a similar problem and so I started to track my win rates and losses and learned where I need to improve with hero league. For example if I had first pick I used to pick kael because he is such a strong dps, that I thought I would kick ass with him. And I honestly though I did okay with him. Then I went on hots logs and found out I only had a 20% win rate with him. So I learned I needed to practice with him more in qm and vs. AI before going into hero league with him. Try to pay attention to what your team needs and where your strengths are. A lot of hero league has to so with good team comp. Try to communicate and pick heroes that go well together or counter the other team well (bw vs ilidan for example).   Also try to find people to play with instead of solo queing. Going in with one or two others that communicate well and you have played with before makes a big difference.   Good luck and if you ever want to join up my battle.net name is Smithel#1480."

The only constant in your game is you, unless you have people you play with all the time, so if you are not deserving to lose so much you should get back on track and win.  I used to play a lot of DPS too and never got over 50% winrate, maybe i am not good at it, maybe it's just that the role lacks impact.

NexusNewbies,3a7obt,To-Ga,0,Wed Jun 17 21:47:55 2015 UTC,I'd prefer a desktop and be able to use it for other things such as art and writing.
NexusNewbies,3a7obt,Siphon1,2,Wed Jun 17 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"If you plan to build your own pc, you can use https://pcpartpicker.com/ . Pcpartpicker also will tell you your wattage for your pc. I chose a 500 watt PSU so you will be good with any where between 450 and 600. It will let you know what is compatible and you can balance out your budget pretty easily. If Not, I've heard good things about ASUS computers and Alienware computers but you will pay more for a completed build. You may not be able to upgrade a pre-built computer either.  Depending on how important graphics are to you, you may or may not need an actual graphics card. By actual, i mean one not built in to the mother board. I have a GTX 960 card and it easily runs the game at makes graphics settings.   Idk what sort of art you do but I'd recommend at least an intel i5. Processors are important for video editing and can be for art depending on how hard it is on your computer. I dont fool with art so im not that familiar with what you can create with respect to the processor, but if you are seriously into your art work and like to make very detailed and graphic intense work, you'll want an i7 for best performance.  8GB ram is pretty much a gold standard right now.   SSD or soldi state drive is essentially a flash drive made into a hard drive. they are more expensive but are less prone to failure and Toshiba has one that is incredibly fast at reading and righting while being at an awesome price compared to other ssd's.  if you arent looking build your own, then when looking at prebuilt computers' look for these stats."
NexusNewbies,3a7obt,m_takeshi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"What To-Ga suggested is a really good starting point. But, if you intend to upgrade the PC little by little, I'd recommend a different approach:   start with an Intel Core i7 with an integrated GPU (will run HotS just fine) decent MB (not pcchips / asrock ) with almost nothing integrated (certainly not GPU) 8gb of RAM is a great starting point I'd advise a 600W PSU  I'd skip the SSD for now    And them, from there, if you can spare a little more cash, buy a GPU, more RAM, SSD, etc etc"

NexusNewbies,3a7obt,babybigger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:06:00 2015 UTC,You can play the game on a low to mid level computer. I play on a laptop and the highest graphics or screen resolution have little impact upon the game. You can get a decent budget gaming computer for $500 to $600 that can easily play this game.
NexusNewbies,3a7obt,Zool2107,0,Thu Jun 18 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"I've got the following specs: Core i3 (2105, so not the newest type) 8 GB ram nVidia GTS450  The game runs fine on 1920x1080 resolution setting everything to ultra in graphis settings. So my configuration is pretty old and cheap, so you don't need the best to run the game smoothly on it."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,Zool2107,3,Wed Jun 17 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"Ideally, you should buy 3 supports. Healers are often what is most needed in HL (with tanks) and 3 is a good number to start HL. If you are going to solo Q, I would avoid Tassadar, and Tyrande is really special. None of them are really healers so they don't fit into team as easily as BW or Malf. However, I completely love Tyrande and she can be great.  The main supports are Lili, Malf, Rehgar, BW and Uther. Brightwing is often considered as the best but honestly all of them are very different and have their advantages / flaws. You should try them and see which ones fit you best.  Also, Sylvana is great and fit well in a lot of teams so it's never a bad idea to buy her. But you have already 2 specialists so I would prioritize an assassin (like Valla, Jaina, even Raynor if you play him well) or a 3rd support."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,henrax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:23:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions :) I have Valla and doing pretty well with her, but I suck with Jaina and KT. I haven't played Raynor a lot, he seems a bit lackluster to me. Is 3 supports a must? I saw some builds and videos about Sylvanas built as a semi-assasin for some dps. Could she be used as an assasin substitute? I can only afford the cheapest 2 supports if I buy her. Or 2 supports ony if I buy BW and a cheap one."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,henrax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"In my experience, 3 supports is a must. Or two expensive / not too easy supports like brightwing and Rehgar. The problem is that Malf and Lili are very easy supports and very cheap, so basically everybody has them. When you start HL it's not that rare to be last pick and the opposing team has already picked both of them. When you climb up the rank, players have more heroes and it becomes less of a problem.  Sylvana is a specialist and excellent for push and merc. Using her as an assassin is not the best idea imo. Some assassins (like Valla) are better suited for this role. You already have Zagara and Gazlowe who are good specialists, I wouldn't buy another one.  And of course, don't buy Raynor, or any hero for that matter, if you haven't ""clicked"" with him. Raynor is a very hard hero to master. It's easy to be decent with him since he is simple, but to have a real impact on a game is difficult.  If I were you I would buy brightwing, Lili and a third support depending on who you like / how much gold you have."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,CLRekstad,2,Wed Jun 17 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"As you mention yourself you're lacking in supports. I can't tell you what you will enjoy playing but I find Reghar to be lots of fun playing as a healing oriented support. Tyrande and Tassadar is regarded as secondary supports as they don't have as much healing power as other supports do. On this note, even though Li Li does have heals they are not targeted which makes her healing potential a bit weaker than other healing oriented heroes.  I say buy heroes you enjoy playing, regardless of what is considered low tier, as I think having fun playing a hero gives you a lot more incentive to actually improve and perform better."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,CLRekstad,0,Wed Jun 17 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Last week there was Uther and Reghar as the free heroes, and I find that I can play Uther better than Reghar. My main support would be either Uther or Brightwing if I choose that way, and Malfurion/Lili would be a secondary solution if I can't choose my main hero in draft.   I really liked Sylvanas, abd she is a top tier hero, but my concer is that if I choose her, then I have to go with two shitty support (Malfurion/Lili). Would that choice affect badly my HL experience?"
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,Raggsocka,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:45:04 2015 UTC,I can't really tell you how that will turn out. I really enjoy playing Sylvanas as well and she will be my next purchase for sure.  From the support perspective I think it's better to have a player pick Li Li or Malfurion than not pick a support hero at all ;)
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,Raggsocka,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"I would buy Uther, Malfurion and whoever else you're interested in. A third support is not a bad idea but Sylvanas is really strong right now and if you like her it's a great choice. Otherwise I would consider a mage type hero like Kael'thas or Jaina, have you tried them?  Best of luck to you :)"
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,Magravan,0,Wed Jun 17 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've tried both mages and I sucked with them :) The strange thing is that I'm doing pretty good with Valla, Sgt. Hammer,  and was good with Sylvanas in the free week too. Maybe that's because the mages don't have a reliable escape tool."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,Magravan,2,Wed Jun 17 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"I see, sounds like you're more into the right-click-dps kind of heroes? You should definitely go for Sylvanas then, even though she is a specialist a lot of people consider her to be more of an assassin.  About the supports I'd definitely get Malf and then either Lili if you can't wait to get into ranked or Uther if you can hold on a bit longer. Lili is fine but I think Uther can bring a bit more to the table. :)"
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,tundranocaps,0,Wed Jun 17 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"Sylvanas gets grabbed a lot in HL. I've seen people on my team queue up for her a couple times, only to have the other team snag her. I don't know that you're going to get the best bang for your buck on her.  Not to mention the fact that when Bans arrive, she's probably going to be first ban on a number of maps."
NexusNewbies,3a67xe,ckax,0,Thu Jun 18 11:53:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Are there any rule on who picks first (like MMR) or is it random?
NexusNewbies,3a5l7x,slasher_lash,3,Wed Jun 17 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"While there are certainly great ways to shut down heroes with a counter pick, a lot of what countering heroes comes down to is talents.  They have a Nova on their team? Take Burning Anger on your tank (several warriors can get this) and she'll have to run around you or you'll knock her out of stealth if she's not careful.  They're going auto attack Raynor? Take Imposing Presence to slow him down if he focuses you, and if he's not, you can get in his face and make him scramble.  Learning about what talents do, what passives do on each hero and what at least their most popular builds look like will do a hell of a lot to teach you how to play against specific heroes and counter them properly."
NexusNewbies,3a5l7x,kirolm,2,Wed Jun 17 12:33:21 2015 UTC,"Also, compared with a lot of other MOBAs with much longer laning phases, counter-picks are much less important compared to picking something that works with your team composition."

It also gives tips for using that hero and playing with one on your team.  heroescounters.com is another option, which is more directly what you seem to want, but lacks context and some matchups aren't well developed there due to it being voted on by visitors to the site."
NexusNewbies,3a5l7x,micfijasan,2,Wed Jun 17 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"Just try and think somewhat intelligently. They got Li Li? Pick a hero with a long range stun such as Tyrande or Muradin to be able to cancel her healing ulti since it's a channel. They got Vikings? They're really squishy so pick either Nova or Zeratul and gank them 24/7 on each lane. Do they have a lot of burst dps? Don't pick a healer such as Li Li, Malf or Bright, pick a burst healer such as Uther or Rehgar."

But you just have to play a little safer, if you don't over extend you egg, they won't solo jungle just to find it, unless they have snowball and have a total map control.  And a good point for you, is that we see really few murky in HL. So a lot of people donesn't how to deal with a very good murky ;)"

NexusNewbies,3a773a,Epicthunder25,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"I really want to start playing SOME_HERO in HL   QM is for fun, HL is for winning. If you really want to play a particular hero, you should play that hero in QM and not have fun at the expense of team members who want to win. In HL you play the heroes that win. The heroes that win depend on first picks, the map, the current meta, tier lists and your skills.  As it is Murky is a very poor hero to play in any case in HL. He's just underpowered and easily countered. There's always a better hero to pick in any situation where you think Murky would work. And even if he was a good hero to pick and you already had a Gazlow and/or an Azmodan picked on your team, would you still pick murky just because you want to play him? This isn't what HL is about."
NexusNewbies,3a773a,swartkrans,3,Wed Jun 17 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"OP don't listen to this guy - Murky is definitely in the current meta and not underpowered. Check Hotslogs, Murky has the 5th highest win rate. Check your facts before you rant on someone asking a simple question."
NexusNewbies,3a773a,Epicthunder25,-2,Thu Jun 18 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"Here are four tier lists that put Murky at the bottom:  kenma's tier list  zuna's tier list  idream's tier list  Chu8's tier list  I've heard chu8, NickHots, ZP, Khaldor and Grubby say Murky is bad right now.  Here's an infographic about the recent DreamHack competition. Guess how many times Murky was picked or banned? 0 times.  The only remotely positive thing anyone has said is Tenton who puts him at tier 3, but says he's terrible in team fights.    Check your facts before you rant on someone asking a simple question.   So what meta are you talking about? Where are your facts. Hotslog doesn't break down QM from HL.  You know what siege specialists you should pick? Sylvanas, Zagara or maybe Azmodan.   And finally, even if Murky were in the meta, that wouldn't in any way invalidate anything I said about how to pick for HL."

Kerrigan might have more burst until late game, but she has to go into melee to do that, and Kael'Thas also has better AoE. I don't enjoy playing all that much though, especially when I'm sometimes prone to fat-fingers. I like Jaina much better, personally.  Chen... is in a bit of a weird spot, it seems his main purpose is to sit there and be annoying while he's unkillable, but he doesn't have hard CC until you get to his Heroic Ability, so you're better with other tanks (ETC, Muradin, say), and he doesn't deal enough damage, so you're better with other bruisers (Tyrael, Sonya).  I like him overall, but his kit doesn't have enough of anything really. You could take him as a second warrior, but you're probably better with someone else."

He's hard to pick up but once you get the hang of him he's fun.  If you pick his +stun and +dmg talents, he almost feels like a tankssassin to me. You can sit there and soak damage while brewing and if you picked brewmaster balance (which increases speed by 20% when under 50 brew, occasional keg+ fire, then when he starts running, kick+keg+fire and chase him down with BAs."

Then they decided to do it by difficult. Hardest is 10 and easiest is 2. Raynow, muradin, valla all follow this. Illidan at 4k is kind of off.   They changed the approach again. I personally believe it will be be priced according to popularity. The price drop on anub from 10k to 4k opened him up to regular play. This excludes the unique characters.

You're more useful to your team when you're baiting somebody (as you're good on health and sort of on standby) then you are running away with low health since in the latter scenario it's too risky to re-engage."
NexusNewbies,3a4del,silverhydra,5,Wed Jun 17 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"As others have said, with so many ranged DPS heros, you need to be much more judicious about when to engage and when not to engage.  Posturing is important as Anubarak because he is not a ""tank"" warrior as much as others are.  You don't want to dive in without a highly coordinated burst following you.  Instead you want to serve as the focus of attention without overcommitting and leaving your team without someone to peel their dives.  Believe it or not, when you are staying back, you aren't useless.  You are generating beetles which are annoying and serving as the line of engagement.  If either team oversteps their bounds, then you are there to either dive and engage or stun and peel.  It feels weird, but you don't have to be doing direct damage as Anubarak to be useful."
NexusNewbies,3a4del,gpnrunxm,2,Wed Jun 17 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"I just played a match for the first time in which I directed everyone, and we won. I wrote in the beginning at level 10 and on let's generally group up and death ball. And I pinged enemy players that were by themselves to gank. It was highly effective. A few times when my team mates didn't group up we died. That's the game, work together and frind the players that are out place and take a camp or boss with enemy heroes down. If only the people would that I play with in QM would be like that all the time.  I've also played the tank a lot and if you are too far ahead of your team and you don't intiate by pressing your only escape the tunnel for anub, you use it to chase as the enemy retreats or you use it to escape death. To intimate you use the spines. And then the Mage throws their ult etc"
NexusNewbies,3a4del,rrrrupp,2,Wed Jun 17 04:06:25 2015 UTC,"Watch how far you go into their camp. Don't burrow charge into the middle of all 5 of them ;) Get close, stun them.. and then back off a bit. Protect your back line. If they target you, great! They aren't targeting your high DPS characters. Just don't die. You'll need to learn how far back to go, when to retreat and how to re enter the fight without dying.  Anub is hard to kill late game when his beetles heal him and he has his healing ult (even harder if you take hardened shell or whatever at 20). You just need to make sure you don't get too aggressive."

NexusNewbies,3a4del,Magravan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"Just remember that your roles as a Warrior are to initiate and peel. Land some stuns so your team can unleash damage, save your burrow for a escape or for when the enemy will not be able to 5-man focus you down. Pay attention to your assassins: if an enemy dives into them, it is your job to stop this enemy, which is another instance of good use of your burrow.  Warriors don't have do attack all the time, their role is to be annoying: harrasing the enemies' DPS and peeling for your own."

NexusNewbies,3a56kn,henrax,5,Wed Jun 17 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"The meta is that depending on the map, some heroes are better than others.  There aren't many OP heroes. K'T has huge burst but is easy to pick off and doesn't reach potential until Lv. 20. Johanna is a super tank but needs a team that will capitalize on her moves or she is just kind of there. Jaina has huge burst but is super positioning based and can easily be taken down if she's not careful. That said, those 3 heroes are often brought up as 'OP', also in no small part because KT and Johanna are both new and don't have a ton of patches into 'em yet."
NexusNewbies,3a56kn,kirolm,4,Wed Jun 17 10:01:34 2015 UTC,"Adding Sylvanas to this list - her trait is extremely strong for pushing lanes, some may say she's OP on haunted mines. Also Brightwing is one of the best healers and currently bugged - trait heals him/her(?) twice."
NexusNewbies,3a56kn,PM_ME_YOUR_WHEY,4,Wed Jun 17 10:08:00 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest difference between this and other mobas is teamwork. After one team hits lvl10 everyone should group to work together and team fight instead of seperating and going off to do their own things.

She is super unbalanced imo and I really don't like going against her. Illidan (if played right) or K'Thas for assassin just because of huge burst damage. Uther or Brightwing on Support. I've had games where an enemy hero is about to die and they hop in and suddenly full health in seconds. Specialists are pretty balanced from what i've seen. Azmodan is more powerful, I think, compared to the others but a good team can destroy you with a Sgt. Hammer or a good Sylvanas"

NexusNewbies,3a56kn,slasher_lash,2,Wed Jun 17 12:00:44 2015 UTC,Sky Temple and Dragon Shire = 5 man objectives. You are going to deal with a lot of burst.  Garden Terror and Blackhearts = Lots of little objectives people spread out for. You are going to have a lot of little fights.
NexusNewbies,3a56kn,kirolm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:51:36 2015 UTC,"Well on the Sky Temple and Dragon Shire you need to hold points. On Dragon Shire there are two shrines that your team has to hold in order to activate the Dragon Knight plus you have to be able to push mid and actually grab it so you need survivability in order to sit on the shrines and make sure they're captured for your team. On Sky Temple, when the temples activate you have to hold them for an extended amount of time so the Temples damage enemy structures. If you get there first you have to A. Fight the temple minions that are stronger than standard minions, and hold off enemy Heroes that come to contest. So you have to be able to survive and hold the temples. On Blackheart's Bay however, you are constantly running to grab coins and turn them in. Dealing damage fast is crucial to swoop in and take chests, which give the most gold. And high burst damage is amazing in order to gank or run off enemies turning in. On the Garden Terror, you jungle a lot to collect the seeds. Fast, high amount of damage are the best here because you are just killing minions to take seeds, and then team fighting the bosses to take a lot of seeds. High DPS is especially helpful here because the faster you can kill the bosses, the less chance the enemy can come steal your seeds, and the faster you get your Terror."

NexusNewbies,3a29bx,twothreesevenseven,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been studying this video... it's kind of what prompted me to write the question in the first place.  Here's an odd question, don't know if anybody knows the answer...  But does the click to move override the attack?  So in the video, it looks like when he plays Valla, he clicks to attack, then after the arrow animation, he clicks to move away (and clicks pretty far away), but then it looks like Valla turns and shoots again before they reach that area.  Now, I get that you're supposed to be clicking, then attack clicking, clicking, then attack clicking... But when I click to move away, then either click back on the baddie, my toon doesn't turn around and shoot, she takes several steps forward towards the target which unfortunately usually puts me in the path of some devastating attack.  What am I doing wrong?"
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,nfefx,5,Thu Jun 18 11:11:50 2015 UTC,"Well I turned smart cast on as soon as I installed so I'm not sure if this is how the game functions by default or just smartcast BUT - if I just press A anywhere on the ground that will 'attack move' me in that direction without having to click again. Basic orb walking in a situation where you are like a Valla being chased by an Illidan would be either right clicking on Illidan or A clicking on the ground in his direction then immediately  right clicking to move away from him once the attack animation has fired. As soon as your attack timer is off cooldown you repeat this process, attack him, move away, etc etc. Attack-clicking or right-clicking directly on your target as opposed to on the ground is optimal if there are multiple targets in the area but easier to miss and click the ground, and if you right-click the ground you just fucked up and moved right next to them as opposed to attacking.  It sounds simple enough but when your char can attack once per second or even more than once per second, perfect orb-walking while getting the most out of your attacks and still keeping distance is a fairly difficult thing to do."
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,cbb692,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"So you do have to essentially re-target after every click to move, right?  I guess that's the thing I'm confused about.  If Attack-move attacks something in that general direction, how do I single out the Illidan if he's in a wave of minions?"
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,nfefx,4,Tue Jun 16 18:00:33 2015 UTC,I made a rather lengthy video about the topic for a different moba a while back. The content might be confusing but the concept is still the same. There's a little bit of history fluff at the beginning but otherwise it should I hope be helpful?

NexusNewbies,3a29bx,Seel007,2,Tue Jun 16 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"If he's around minions you need to click directly on him, and it becomes harder to orb-walk perfectly because clicking directly on someone is harder than just on the ground. You are more likely to make a mistake.  If they are the only target close to you, you can just A-move the ground."
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,nightshiftb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:02:28 2015 UTC,Can you just hold A while clicking the ground?
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,SawcasmOfficial,3,Wed Jun 17 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you got a full answer to your question.. so here it is in simple terms:  Stutter stepping is the term used for a technique which allows heroes to maneuver around a battle while still doing your right-click attach (or auto attack).  So, a player who does not attempt stutter stepping basically will right click a spot on the map, arrive there, and start doing auto attacks. Then move a bit, and do more auto attacks. But a player who is stutter stepping is moving from point A to point B with a bunch of pauses in between to allow the hero to get off their auto attack. As you can imagine, the second scenario allows for much more dmg output while still retreating or repositioning."
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,dizzyMongoose,2,Tue Jun 16 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, that when you take too long to ""stutter step"" it can actually lower your effective right click DPS, unless you time it perfectly."
NexusNewbies,3a29bx,hsramm,2,Wed Jun 17 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"Here's my rundown of how stutter stepping works:  Every hero has a cooldown on their basic attack. For instance, after Raynor shoots, he has to wait 0.8 seconds before he can shoot again (thus the 1.25 attack speed: 1 attack / 0.8 seconds  = 1.25 attacks/second). The idea behind stutter stepping is, rather than just stand around, you can use the time between attacks to move around for just under 0.8 seconds, then tell Raynor to attack again, and you will have gotten to move during his attack cooldown without losing any DPS. The constant attack/move stop-and-go action is why it's called stutter stepping. This is the key technique to master when playing any hero built for auto-attacking, like Raynor, Falstad, or Valla, because you need to be able to stay within attack range of your target, but you need to stay out of range of enemy melee attacks.  The process:   Attack something with your basic attack. Right click where you want to move. If you want to kite, click behind your hero; if you want to chase, click in front of your hero. The distance doesn't have to be exact, because you'll cancel your move in the next step, so it just needs to be in the right direction, though the less you move your mouse, the easier it'll be on your wrists, so don't click too far. Before your hero's attack cooldown finishes, tell your hero to attack a target again so they'll shoot as soon as they're off cooldown. This is usually done in one of three ways:   Right click a specific enemy target. This has the advantage of not requiring any key presses. However, it requires the most mouse precision, because if you miss your target and click empty ground, you'll move without attacking, which can be disastrous. Use your attack-move command (A by default) to either specifically target a unit or to attack-move to a location. This is more complicated than right clicking since you have to issue a key command at your mouse, but it's safer, since if you miss a specific target the attack-move will at least shoot the closest enemy instead of moving without attacking. Use the stop command (S by default). This cancels your movement, and the AI will then attack the closest enemy in range. This is the simplest way to cancel your movement, but you can't specify who to attack in case there are multiple enemies in range.  Repeat from step 2.   Note that if you take too long between moving and cancel-attacking, you will reduce your DPS, because you won't be attacking on cooldown, so stutter stepping properly requires you to have a good feel for how long your hero takes between attacks. Raynor in particular is a special case, because he can regularly boost his attack speed with Inspire, so you have to know to shorten your steps when you're buffed. Also, some heroes can take talents like Nexus Frenzy or Berserk that can change their attack speeds permanently, so you always have to account for the current state of your hero.  Also, regarding Tychus: don't bother trying to time your steps. His attack speed is so fast once the minigun revs up that it's pointless to try to time it properly between cooldowns.  Here's something that helped me with stutter stepping: map your attack-move key binding to your Space key as an alternate. I find it's much easier for me to hit Space constantly than A while keeping my fingers on QWE. I remapped the centering and spotlight functions that are normally on Space to the grave accent (`) key to the left of 1; you shouldn't need to recenter your camera nearly as often, so that's a convenient place for me to hit it when needed."

I like her because I personally love playing any sort of backline role and Siege Tank. There's a reason her difficulty is hard. She's a hard character to play.  Don't get discouraged though. If you like the idea of how she plays the commitment of learning her is rewarding. I'm a casual player.

You don't want to treat her like the others and rush in to fight. Positioning is huge with her as is keeping your mobility (Z boosters) ready.

NexusNewbies,3a2gxf,You-Can-Quote-Me,2,Tue Jun 16 23:36:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that using your rockets while in siege mode will immediately take you out of it and make you mobile regardless of what skills you've taken.
NexusNewbies,3a2gxf,Chunderfluff,2,Tue Jun 16 23:33:56 2015 UTC,You're right it does force you out of siege
NexusNewbies,3a2gxf,AndhereKatil,2,Wed Jun 17 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part, but I disagree about solo seiging and seiging early on. Hammer has one of the best escapes in the game. If you are solo Qing, you should get her talent heal. This combined with the booster makes sure you almost never die. Someone else mentioned this, but the booster will also take you out of seige mode. Seige all you want, but make sure your booster is off cooldown. Team fighting with her is definitely hard, and without mobile seige tank talent picked up, it is almost never worth seiging  for fights. I would say Hammer is better played as a reactionary hero. When a lane is empty, seige up in it, push it, back off to a merc camp and if your team is fighting nearby, great. But don't expect to contribute a lot to team fights by running in. The hero is very position dependent, so you really have to get comfortable with knowing where to seige. One thing you didn't mention is her seige range against enemy towers. She out ranges towers, so if you see a friendly lane pushed all the way up, head to it, seige just barely in range to shoot one of the towers and take it out in 10 seconds before leaving. It's a massive mistake to not hit towers as hammer. That's about all I would add. SoloQ with hammer is very difficult because often times you will seige up to help a teamfight and before you know it, all your teammates have retreated behind you."

The engine is based on SC2 and the pathing algorithms would not have lasted long if they were random or inefficient.  One thing, are you spamming move commands while trying to move long distances?  Small changes in your end point can cause rather large changes in the chosen pathing.  When traversing maps, I highly suggest only clicking once to move -- its easy to get stuck behind a circular obstacle and ping pong back and forth for a while because you are spamming move commands that are right on the edge of two efficient paths.  Not sure what you are talking about concerning the HOTS maps and boxing in -- body blocking is a huge and underrated component of this game and really separates the good tanks (for example) from the mediocre tanks.  Maybe I misinterpreted your question, however."

If you plan on spending real money in the game it's generally considered more efficient to purchase the 10k gold heroes and but the cheaper ones with igg. Another option is to look into buying the Zeratul code off a site like Kinguin or g2a for cheap since an extra was included in the starter set and there are an abundance of them.

NexusNewbies,3a49a5,dartmasternl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:14:38 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to try the free rotation heroes. If you like one of those you can buy them and if you don't, you didn't wasted any gold. The 3 you mention are very fun heroes, but abathur and murky are not very viable in HL unless you are a beast with mentioned heroes."
NexusNewbies,3a49a5,dartmasternl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:13:01 2015 UTC,"If you can multi-task well with TLV, I highly recommend Abathur.  I picked him up after playing a lot of Brightwing (global presence) and haven't looked back -- Pajamathur OP."
NexusNewbies,3a2bj1,redstar_5,3,Tue Jun 16 17:57:43 2015 UTC,http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wombo-combo.  Amazing combo plus the crazy fan reactions are what makes it a wombo-combo.

NexusNewbies,3a2bj1,scene_missing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:37:17 2015 UTC,I'd known it in Hearthstone for about two years now. Think it came from fighting games....  Can't get the KYM link to work.
NexusNewbies,3a2bj1,xDigster,3,Tue Jun 16 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"In mobas it is used to signify a combination of abilities coming from different heroes that synergises very well.  For example, hitting Sonyas Leap with Arreat crater and then having Jaina using Ring of frost on all enemies caught in that crater with the Ring of Frost. And then continuing stacking other abilities on top of this."
NexusNewbies,3a2bj1,MyAlternateAlternate,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:25:11 2015 UTC,"1) Zero-to-Death ownage in just a few seconds,  2) Zhu’s painful demise by the hands of Silent Spectre and Tang,  3) To be utterly destroyed very quickly.  It means the ability to chain ultimates or skillshots to basically 100-0 a player before the player or healer can react with a save. This is the difference between ""burst"" and ""sustain"" characters, referring to a hero's ability to front load their damage (ie. Jaina) vs. have it drawn out over time (ie. Sylvanus). To a lesser extent, a character with the ability to stunlock (ie. prevent a save from being cast) also plays a part in helping set up a wombo combo.  To a lesser extent, it can infer synergies between heroes, but the true definition is just tearing the enemy a new asshole before they can stop the bleeding."
NexusNewbies,3a2bj1,AnteupAlante,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:31:53 2015 UTC,E.T.C. CC Ult + Nova AoE Ult = Wombo Combo.
NexusNewbies,3a2bj1,SawcasmOfficial,0,Wed Jun 17 17:18:09 2015 UTC,A combo followed by a wombo

NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,PoodleDestroyer,6,Tue Jun 16 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine decreased xp from a kill would even closely warrant a hero dying   Well he only gives 25% of normal XP if his egg is up (which is always should be), so if you can make 2-3 people chase you for a while then they end up getting less XP than if they just went and soaked a wave, thus you waste their time. You could also be pulling them away from an objective, or putting them out of position. Additionally, effort spent killing the hero that respawns quickly means time and cooldowns that aren't spent killing the ""more important"" heroes on your team who have longer respawn timers."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,BoxOfAids,5,Wed Jun 17 00:17:07 2015 UTC,"Egg shenanigans usually; with that 3 second respawn and the ability to place the egg anywhere I've seen some hilarious things when my friend played Murkey.  One that I can remember is that he bullied top while there was a 4v5 in bottom, the enemies could not leave the Murky unattended so they sent somebody up there where my friend promptly suicided. His egg was in bottom and now it was a 5v4 in our favor and a fort was down.  And that's basically Murky's strength, he fucks with people. He's annoying, you try and kill him and he bubbles away. This makes you angry so the next time you see Murky you swear you'll kill him, and he does, but now he's on the other side of the map destroying stuff and causing you to reposition yourself while the enemy team takes advantage of the confusion.  Once you get the hang of him he's great to screw with people."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,silverhydra,3,Wed Jun 17 01:08:58 2015 UTC,Where is everybody getting 3 second respawn from? It's 5
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,SawcasmOfficial,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"I actually just got that number from the other comment, I knew it was super short but wasn't sure of the number."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,silverhydra,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:39:31 2015 UTC,You are correct. Still a lot shorter than a majority of ability cds.
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,Seel007,3,Wed Jun 17 03:43:08 2015 UTC,Wastes time of enemies and distracts them. They also get nearly no exp from killing him
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,ajdeemo,0,Wed Jun 17 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"So, he does less overall and has to die in order to have his team benefit? :/ Doesn't seem like a very well executed champ concept to me... Still feels like i'm missing something."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,ajdeemo,5,Wed Jun 17 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"He doesn't HAVE to die to have his team benefit, but if he does die, then the enemy doesn't gain much.   See, Murky can push and challenge objectives without being in nearly as much risk as other heroes."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,Magravan,2,Wed Jun 17 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"Murky dying for no reason is still a bad thing. All else being equal, 25% xp is still an xp gain.   Murky dying while doing one of the many things that he's good at doing, on the other hand, can often put your team ahead overall, despite the minor setback of him dying.  Ultimately, he's just a character that can be played very recklessly for small gains over time that add up."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,Kiumbra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"Nice, this is the type of answer I was looking for, if I was to say, the risk of playing a character recklessly should be lesser than the benefit. I suppose someone with perfect game sense would play murky very well but I have a hard time getting behind the character's concept (high risk low/average reward).  All that being said, thank you for the well written reply and my apologies for not being able to write a better one than this(mobile)."
NexusNewbies,3a3mjn,angelini5,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:58:52 2015 UTC,I haven't seen anyone mention anywhere that because of the reduced death exp if murky trades 1 for 1 or even dies twice to secure a kill it's completely worth it because it's still less exp than the enemy you killed gets
NexusNewbies,3a21x8,SlNATRA,4,Tue Jun 16 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"My impression is that a lot of Heroes players have previously played LoL, Dota 2, etc. So if you're brand new to mobas, Heroes is a good place to start since it is relatively easier to play, but you'll still get destroyed by someone who has more experience. Try playing Co-op vs. AI for a while to practice if you're not having fun in PvP?"

NexusNewbies,3a21x8,topher78714,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:44:35 2015 UTC,I sent you a request ! Thanks for the tips !  Right now i'm using Raynor with an auto-attack build that I found online. Seems great for beginner.
NexusNewbies,3a21x8,topher78714,3,Tue Jun 16 17:48:18 2015 UTC,"Not a bad choice. My beginner friendly heroes are:  Valla Raynor LiLi (my favorite of this list, but I like playing support) ETC  If you have some real money to spend, picking up the starter bundle in the store is a good way to go and provides some pretty good heroes. For now I'd stay away from heroes like abathur, Vikings, uther, and kaelthas. They are great heroes but require some skill and practice to use them correctly. I typically play evening east coast time so feel free to join up if you see me on, or message me with any questions you may have. Also check out sites like www.hotslogs.com and www.heroesfire.com for ideas on how to play each hero."

NexusNewbies,3a1yhk,PoppedBalloons,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"Seeing how they already answered your question, a small tip that i see most illidan players dont know is that most of the time you should not use your ult to engage a fight, you use it when you are getting low and to get out of roots or dodge aoe effects. it will give your team time to attack them while you turn invincible for that period of time."
