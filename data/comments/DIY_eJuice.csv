DIY_eJuice,3e571g,gremlinjuice,3,Wed Jul 22 01:20:54 2015 UTC,This is great news. I'll be looking in soon for sure. And it will give me an excuse to try some gremlin juice if I can sneak it in with my diy supplies.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,La_Pesadilla,3,Wed Jul 22 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"That's awesome to hear. We can always use another reliable supplier, that's for sure. Do you plan to sell a concentrate of your vanilla custard? I've never had it but I've heard good things about it."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,ThirdWorldOrder,2,Wed Jul 22 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely second/third the Inawera vote, and Flavorah as well."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,HocusKrokus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:12:27 2015 UTC,Yu0. Inawara biscuit seems to be the other popular flavor that's sometimes hard to get.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,MrsCustardSeesYou,2,Wed Jul 22 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"It's because crazies like me buy it up whenever it is in stock. Since its from Poland the shipping times are higher to US distribution companies, so it can be harder to come by."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,HocusKrokus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:55:59 2015 UTC,Favorite recipe with it?
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,MrsCustardSeesYou,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:02:21 2015 UTC,Funny you say that. I have 200ml of it coming from BCV. In 10ml bottles each... looks like I'm going to have some fun re-bottling this weekend.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,KeggsNA,2,Wed Jul 22 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"Also, it's nice to have a vendor that is so active in the community, and sharing discontinued recipes at that."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,skiddlzninja,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:35 2015 UTC,Congratulations. A couple flavors I've been having a hard time getting my hands on are FA cream fresh and CAP cinnamon danish swirl. The latter I've been able to get once but cream fresh has eluded me entirely. Double up on those and you'll be off to a good start.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,McHairpie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"This may be a dumb question, but are cream fresh and fresh cream 2 different flavors?"
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,Anemiatic,2,Wed Jul 22 02:00:41 2015 UTC,FA is made in Italy. They say shit backwards over there. Hence the confusion.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,McHairpie,2,Wed Jul 22 02:24:55 2015 UTC,Don't even get me started on INW...
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,skiddlzninja,2,Wed Jul 22 02:54:39 2015 UTC,Thank you for saving me from asking that question.  LOL
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,Botboy141,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:30:55 2015 UTC,Same flavor.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,SCReVAC,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:22:36 2015 UTC,Any International shipping available?
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,Botboy141,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of that... Being an e-liquid vendor I am used to saying no, but the e-liquid is completely different.  The problem I will have is finding a way to block the sale of the pre-made liquid, but allow the sale of the flavoring.   The other major hurdle will be the payment situation. I have opened international funds a couple times in the past and have had to close it up after less than a week each time due to chargebacks, shipping problems and just plain theft. (A purchase is made, paid for and shipped, and after it leaves the country I get a chargeback because the card number was stolen.)   I would like to think that we can work something out... Dwolla is vape friendly, I've used that on occasion with a few select customers in France and the UK.  Short story long, I would like to remain optimistic on that."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,SCReVAC,2,Wed Jul 22 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure who your gateway is but I've filled orders for Singapore, UAE, Great Britain and France and a few others all using www.authorize.net as my gateway. With the right requirements in place, I've never had a chargeback either."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,marybd841,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:14 2015 UTC,"(A purchase is made, paid for and shipped, and after it leaves the country I get a chargeback because the card number was stolen.)   Well, I guess thats why we cant have nice things :( Best of luck with the plan though, will be interesting to see how it takes off."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,Botboy141,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"This is exciting and I wish you the best of luck with it!  I think the most popular sizes right now are normally 10 or 15ml, 30ml and 4oz sizes.  I think most of us are just doing DIY for ourselves and maybe a few friends so those sizes usually fit our needs.   The most frustrating thing though is vendors not having flavors in stock.  I know it is a difficult task but if you can keep a majority of your flavors in stock at all times, you will be successful. There is nothing more annoying than having to place orders at 3 different vendors and still not being able to get everything you wanted because they were out of stock.  Also, check out Inawera flavorings.  They have some really excellent ones(Biscuit, Raspberry, Cactus)."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,marybd841,2,Wed Jul 22 01:41:54 2015 UTC,And worse yet paying shipping 3 times because you couldn't order enough of what you wanted from one vendor alone to qualify for free shipping =).
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,Botboy141,2,Wed Jul 22 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly!"
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,rastal3x,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Keeping things in stock is required in our shop!  :)  If we run out of flavors, we can't sell product. If we can't sell product, we can't pay the rent.  Now... if FW is out of stock... that's a different animal. There are a few flavors I know are hard to depend on with an order, so those are kept at high re-order levels just in case. I HATE running out of stuff!  I will definitely check out Inawera. I've heard good things. /u/flavorah - I'm looking at you too!!!"
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,MrsCustardSeesYou,2,Wed Jul 22 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely pick up Flavorah, think you'd be the first re-seller and it'd be great to not have to go direct.  Inawera is a must as well IMPO if you really want to compete with the BCV's of the world. Hangsen while not wildly popular is easy enough to at least offer in 10ml bottles.  FWIW, INW is easy to get set up with and you can always pay with PayPal or WireTransfer (just not CC IME)."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,hotwingsandcoldbeer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:01 2015 UTC,I definitely love most Inawera flavors as well :)
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,skiddlzninja,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:33:06 2015 UTC,I'd als9 be curious about German Flavours flavoring offerings. I wouldn't expect you to carry that right off the bat but maybe down the line?  However I will be happy to order from you because I think geographically you're closer to me than the other vendors I've ordered from. Maybe it means the postman won't thwart me as much making me wait.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,C-Hayes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like you have 4 of the most popular brands covered. Now if you can somehow manage what seems to be the impossible, always being in stock on all flavors, you will be rewarded. If I didn't have to jump around to 2 or 3 different websites, usually having to pay shipping at each, I'd go to your shop as first choice. The flavor bases are a huge plus."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,vaperforlife,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:50:58 2015 UTC,Protip: buy gallons of INW buscuit. You'll get plenty of orders just for having that in stock.
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,vaperforlife,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"+1 for Flavorah! And it will be awesome to craft some gremlin juice of my own, been so long since i've tasted that delicious vanilla custard!"
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,christopherson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"I would make sure that you have all the flavors listed in the sidebar under My First Flavors order. Please remember that, regardless of what you're going to carry, just carry enough so that you're not selling out in between shipments."
DIY_eJuice,3e571g,WaterFlourYeast,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:03:08 2015 UTC,GREAT suggestion. Tomorrow I'll put an order in for the one's I'm missing.

What kind of profile does it have as a single flavor mix? Was looking forward to ordering some and experimenting. Any feedback on any of their other new flavors?"
DIY_eJuice,3e3u55,Sugawolf,2,Tue Jul 21 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"I actually have really high hopes for it, it tastes very bready and doughy, it adds a lot of body and texture,  not good by itself but I thought it has high potential to be an add in like AP for dessert and bakery flavors. I have yet to try mixing it with anything else, hopefully it doesn't take over my mixes like it did for OP.  I got a bunch (not enough) of Flavorah samples during their last sale, and all of them have blown me away with how good they are. Typically they're some of if not the best representations of certain flavors I've ever tried; Blueberry just by itself is insanely good, definitely ordering a 4oz of that when I run out."
DIY_eJuice,3e3u55,Mercy404,2,Tue Jul 21 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"I co-created this recipe with OP. Agree 100% very doughy taste and feel. I have another strawberry cheesecake recipe that uses .5 and its almost too full of a flavor. The strawberry is FLV in that, taste is very similar to strawberry jam.   I also have boysenberry which is a fantastic standalone flavor but haven't found a good mix yet and cream which is a nice simple whipped cream flavor. Ugggh I need more FLV."
DIY_eJuice,3e3u55,Arodsteezy2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:04:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it would probably be best to try at 0.25% - 0.5% as an additive more than a flavor per se. Would you mind sharing your progress on the strawberry recipe?  I just got around to trying FLV Strawberry tonight, and I also thought of jam or jelly but not nearly as sweet. I want to expiriment with a combination of Cap Sweet Strawberry, TFA strawberry ripe, and FLV strawberry as a strawberry base.  For Boysenberry I wad thinking it would go really well with Blueberry flavors (FLV, TFA, maybe both). If I had the chance I'd also trying mixing it with Hawk Sauce, which I haven't had in ages but used to like before I started DIYing. It would probably work well with any sour berry flavor, but hawk sauce is the only one I've encountered."

Ive used some to make hard candy, flavor frosting, milk, coffee, tea pudding, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. Ive also put some flavorings on the furnace air filter, let it dry first if it is alcohol based.

You can buy a gallon of USP glycerin with free shipping to the UAE for about $120 which is expensive but a gallon is ~3800mL.  That's 160x 30ml bottles or under $0.75 per 30ml bottle of eliquid.

DIY_eJuice,3e3mc7,BCV_Jeff,3,Tue Jul 21 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"You should post an estimated date for flavors that are coming in, and add a pre-order option for those items. With perhaps an option to grab items in stock, and ship at the same time when it's all together? Save some people headaches, and would probably make more sales in the end. I know that's a lot of work on the backend coding, not to mention having to store packages that are awaiting the future items, but probably worth it ;D I guess the only option if ordering like that would be one shipment, otherwise it would complicate things further. But just ideas for you."

DIY_eJuice,3e3mc7,BCV_Jeff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:58 2015 UTC,There should be a place on the product page for you to put your e-mail address in for notifications. I think it only works on the desktop version though.

DIY_eJuice,3e3m5m,Amelite,6,Tue Jul 21 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"The easy math is this:  Nicotine is calculated using mg/ml.  Your 100mg/ml solution is in fact 10% nicotine, 90% base.  If you want a 6mg/ml result in your juice, that is 0.6% of total volume but 6% of your juice needs to be your 100mg/ml base solution. 1.8ml is correct.  If you want a 6mg/ml result in your juice, that is still 0.6% of total volume, but now you are using a base that 4.167 times weaker than your 100mg/ml solution. This results in requiring 7.5ml of 24mg/ml solution in a 6mg final mix @ 30ml batch size.  Another way to think about it:  100mg/ml = 10% 24mg/ml = 2.4%    You want a 0.6% end result.  (0.6 / 10) * VOLUME = ML required by volume for 100mg/ml (1.8ml in 30ml) (0.6 / 2.4) * VOLUME = ML required by volume for 24mg/ml (7.5ml in 30ml)    Hope this helps to clarify and not confuse further."
DIY_eJuice,3e3m5m,Botboy141,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"OHHHH! Thank you! That clears everything up for me. I was using the nicotine base as a whole, rather than a fraction. So, with 1/10 nicotine strength @ 100mg/ml, we would multiply the 2.4% nicotine by 10 to arrive at the 24% mark."
DIY_eJuice,3e3m5m,bmorrison1982,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:07 2015 UTC,I think your are confusing yourself  .06 * 30 = 1.8mL of 100 mg nic  .24 * 30ml = 7.2mL of 100 mg nic
DIY_eJuice,3e3m5m,wurzle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"Right, but this post is what confused me:  [–]crappy_guitaristSoV Shift Mod & Rhyno 3 points 5 hours ago   Vaping does not deliver nicotine the same way. In cigarettes, nicotine is delivered into your body via ammonia, which is why you feel the nicotine ""surge"", when taking a drag.  In vaping, there is no ammonia, so, while you get the nicotine, you don't feel it immediately.  I think 24mg (2.4%) is too high for you. That's why you're getting the sore throat. I smoked a pack a day, and started with 6mg (.6%), but I think it was too low.  Might I suggest trying a 12mg (1.2%)?"

The nana cream clone is one i have begun to mix, and i like it a lot so will definitely try your recipe next time i order some concentrates.   Something weird i noticed though, i'm not sure if its due to vapors tongue or whatever, but i find that if i brush my teeth and then vape a while afterwards the nana cream is SO much more flavorful, even if i vape it after i wake up its never as good as after brushing my teeth, so, this poses a question. Could it be that it has a small amount of some mint in it too? I mean if i'm the only one who notices this then probably not, but, try it and see if you agree!"
DIY_eJuice,3e1u7m,kaizokushinobi,3,Tue Jul 21 11:52:34 2015 UTC,"It's probably the fact that brushing your teeth clears any other flavors out of your mouth, and replaces them with that minty taste. Try brushing with a cinnamon toothpaste and see if you get the same results.  I'm positive there isn't mint in 'NC, and it may just be that he uses a sweetener or two to really pump up the flavor and mouthfeel."

I agree that while fizz's recipe is good, after tasting the original, I found that something was missing. Very subtle though. I almost get a small rind-ish back end note to it. Sorta like the inside of a banana or orange peel (the white stuff). It's very very light though. Maybe it's just me, but that's the only real difference that I get from it. Maybe less dragon fruit too. Definitely no CA as well. CA is harsh to me and bombies is very smooth.  I'm certainly gonna give this one a try though. Thanks!"

Bavarian cream or sweet cream would also pair very well with this. I always add a couple drops of lemon concentrate to make fruits pop too, sour can mute flavors over time, and 2% is a little high IMO.

He even has some of the 'unusual' stuff that they have, like the faded bottles.   Look at this, from his website, versus this, from container and packaging supply. All of the glass bottles are like that.  He's selling at a reasonable markup from their website, which just makes me feel like he's buying from them and reselling. There isn't a point if you know the other website exists, they will ship the same stuff for cheaper.  And honestly, this account is brand new, with already removed posts, so it feels like a shill account to me.  I can speak for the validity of Container and Packaging, so if he's reselling their stuff, then they're good bottles. I'd rather buy it from them directly though.  EDIT: Not a shill account, was an unwarranted attack on my part, and I apologize to /u/BS-Shawn for claiming he was a shill. I don't think he is.

It is amazing. Taste like butter beer. If I could get a vape flavor of that I would be in heavan.

DIY_eJuice,3e13l4,Vapespin,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:31 2015 UTC,I use Heartland Vapes. Good prices on gallons of PG/VG and free shipping on orders over $75 (even VG/PG - unlike most other places).

DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,holisticbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:11 2015 UTC,Etekcity 0.001oz/0.01g 500g Table-Top Digital.   The problem with this is it has no A/C adapter to run off the wall - and it has an auto-off feature I believe.  Best of luck though!  I can't wait to start mixing by weight.
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,holisticbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:03 2015 UTC,Well I mixed up a 30mL batch and it seemed to work fine.  The auto off takes a while and I haven’t noticed any shutoffs while I’m pouring juice in.  I guess I went for a cheaper scale because I bought 17 flavors for my first order.
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,Madnapali,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"Hey man, whatever works for you for sure!  I'm really stoked to get into mixing by weight, seems like it's going to be so much nicer.  Gratz on getting into DIY, 17 flavors is a great start!  I think I'm up to 50...  O_0   it's a problem."
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,toonerz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:48:43 2015 UTC,Thanks... It is a breeze I really appreciate Botboys guide on the sidebar. I followed that and this calculator   http://e-liquid-recipes.com/create   mentioned elsewhere around here.  I used to work in a lab so just the thought of mixing by mLs was giving me PTSD.  I can already tell it is going to be a problem I'm one of the damned.  Between this and home brewing  I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is going to leave me
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,Madnapali,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:55 2015 UTC,Why is the 3000g model cheaper?
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,MurderMelon,4,Mon Jul 20 20:28:21 2015 UTC,That (and the 1000g model) only show up to 0.1g of accuracy whereas the 500g one shows up to 0.01g. Really important when mixing by weight.
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,Glitchlol,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what I thought. Shame, I'd like something that could weigh that high."
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,MurderMelon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"Even if you use a glass bottle, you'll still be able to mix like 300mL of liquid. And since mixing by weight is so fast, you can get lots of batches done really quickly."
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,Glitchlol,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:39 2015 UTC,I've mixed 2L glass bottles with the 500g scale. It's a 500g limit per measurement when using the TAR button.
DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,MurderMelon,0,Tue Jul 21 01:26:08 2015 UTC,That will damage your scale. The sensor inside it is only meant to handle 500g total.

DIY_eJuice,3dz40n,johnstone1690,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"As someone stated further down, they are cheaper because they aren't as accurate (.1 vs .01 grams)    When mixing by weight, you need at LEAST .01 accuracy, some of these concentrates are POWERFUL."

DIY_eJuice,3e07v6,Vendeta44,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Not worth the risk. But to be clear ethanol and water should evaporate from these flavorings really easily by letting it sit without a cap or heating it up. Leaving you with essentially pg based flavoring. Although who the fuck knows if there safe, you would need a MSDS to find that out."
DIY_eJuice,3e07v6,jmillermcp,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be as worried about the water or ethanol as much as I'd be with what molecules they used to arrive at those flavors. Some are harmless enough when ingested but to be vaporized and inhaled?  Plus other than the coconut, the others look to have artificial coloring which you definitely don't want to vape. Steer clear."
DIY_eJuice,3e07v6,Marikc1,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"Any way to determine if they're safe for vaping?   Well, you could vape it and find out, but I wouldn't advise it.  The serious answer: don't even think about trying to vape that."

They sell the tops separately on everything including child resist droppers, non-child resist droppers, etc.  If you buy in bulk, 30ml clear glass bottles are $0.17 each (360 minimum), dropper tops are $0.26 each for 1800+. If you want Child Resistant Droppers, they are the same price.  $0.43 each for high quality glass with child resistant dropper = win."

DIY_eJuice,3dzxj9,dolla777,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"I ordered both bottles. I use the 2oz bottle to hold my PG/VG. They are good bottles I guess? I mean they do what they're supposed to do and they haven't leaked yet. As for the unicorn bottles, I ordered 30 of each size, which is the most they would let me. I love these unicorn bottles. No leaks and no problems. They are great quality bottles for 0.40 cents each. You can fit the end of your syringe in the bottle without the needle; people seem to have a problem doing so with the lower quality unicorn bottles because the tip is too small. Also, the cap is a clear color. In the pic, I think it was black.   tl;dr- Great quality bottles. OSDIY is the cheapest I found for unicorn bottles but they won't let you order more than 30."

DIY_eJuice,3dzobx,Nikkotine,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:50 2015 UTC,What exactly are you going for?  What flavor profile are you trying to hit (Fruity / Savory)?  Boysenberry you might want to bump up some as I find it kind of weak at 1%.    The banana nut bread kind of stands out as something I would omit.  I wouldnt use MTS Vape wizard at .5 to start.  I would make a test batch of 15ml with the vape wizard at .25 and a test batch without.   While FLV Blueberry is an awesome flavor I would drop it down some so It won't overtake the strawberry; unless that is what your going for.    The most important thing is: If you enjoy it then it is perfect.  I have all the flavors but Banana nut bread myself.
DIY_eJuice,3dzobx,Davesnothear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm going for a fruity berry mix that isn't cloying or sickening sweet. I'm basically looking for additional flavor suggestions (other fruit, marshmallow, EM, AP, etc). I've tried it with and without the BnB, and found it to be better with it--everything seems to layer well. I will try dropping the MTS to .25 and dropping the FLV Blueberry to .5. Does MTS mute flavors above a certain percentage? I'm a lurker on this sub and haven't contributed much, but this mix seemed worthy! I keep reaching for this over my other DIY."
DIY_eJuice,3dzobx,dgpro5000,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:14:52 2015 UTC,Id start more simply. Tfa strawberry and vanilla bean go excellent together.  Try 8 and 3 % and try variations on that.

DIY_eJuice,3dznpd,Botboy141,3,Mon Jul 20 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"I've made 4 or 5 purchases from them, one turned into a nightmare. I already had FA Raspberry, made another order for Cap Raspberry, and they sent me a bottle of the FA. First had me take pictures to prove it, which okay...  fine. Told it would ship out the same day, but never even got an apology, even in future emails.  4 days went by. Sent an email. Classic response. It's been sent, give it more time. Another week goes by. Same thing. Told to wait another week because sometimes USPS is slow.  When it finally arrived, checking the shipped date, it was sent after my final email I had sent them. If you mess up, okay fine. Forget to send it? Okay, that's fine too. But lie to me?  Multiple times? It's a bold faced lie, or incompetence. You pick.  Needless to say, think I've made one order from them since for two items, because I couldn't find them anywhere else. I won't be making a large purchase from them again."
DIY_eJuice,3dznpd,mentive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:00 2015 UTC,Call capella and get on their wholesale list. They didn't ask me for my Resell info even though I offered. Their wholesale pricing on their 13mL bottles are cheap as hell compared to it's retail. IIRC something like 40% cheaper.

I remember checking like a year or so ago and it was ~$23 a bottle and ECX had it for $20 so I just started getting it there but they've been out of stock for like 2 weeks at least.
DIY_eJuice,3dy6go,ju1ceboxx,8,Mon Jul 20 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"Been trying to clone this myself. It's probably my second favorite juice of all time. The more variations I try, the less TFA Bavarian Cream I taste in the original.  Since Witty offers an 85/15 blend. The flavor total needs to be 15% or less, and TFA BC isn't strong enough unless used at a high percentage, so I really don't think it's in there.   I started thinking about how to make a Bavarian Cream without using TFA BC. First I went the food recipe route. And added those flavors to a mix. It didn't come out close though. So what I'm going to do next is use TFA's component list here: http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=338222  I think Fresh Cream might be better than Sweet Cream, since it has both Ethyl Vanillin and Vanillin (Sweet Cream is missing the Ethyl Vanillin). TFA Maple looks to be pure Cyclotene, so that's an option. But Caramel Candy also has it in addition to the Guaethol, so we'll use that. Veratraldehyde is covered by the Toasted Marshmallow, Toasted Almond also has it though, so it could also be used in here somehow. And last we have Coumarin. Toasted Almond also has this, so that probably definitely needs to be in there.   A good starting point will be to use:   Fresh Cream Caramel Candy Toasted Marshmallow Toasted Almond Cap VC   I'll be mixing tonight, so hopefully I have more direction to go at tomorrow after initial smell/tasting."
DIY_eJuice,3dy6go,seratne,3,Mon Jul 20 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"Warning: Some rambling at the end.  Mixed two batches. I thought I had TFA caramel candy and fresh cream, looks like they were Flavor West and FlavourArt respectively. But I made a batch with the above first.     Ingredient ml g %    Caramel Candy (FW) 0.03 0.03 0.2   Cream Fresh (FA) 0.45 0.45 3   Toasted Almond (TPA) 0.3 0.3 2   Toasted Marshmallow (TPA) 0.9 0.9 6   Vanilla Custard v1 (CAP) 0.45 0.45 3    No steeping obviously but smells like the Cap VC is too much. Caramel Candy is also pretty strong somehow at just 1 drop. It's good, although it reminds me of Dulce de Leche.   Second batch was more of a sniff each bottle of flavoring I have side by side with the original and see if it was in there.    Ingredient ml g %    Brown Sugar (TPA) 0.1 0.1 1   Cream Fresh (FA) 0.2 0.2 2   Dairy Milk (TPA) 0.2 0.2 2   Toasted Almond (TPA) 0.2 0.2 2   Toasted Marshmallow (TPA) 0.7 0.7 7   Vanilla Custard v1 (CAP) 0.1 0.1 1    To this I also added 3 drops of Vanillin and 1 drop MTS after it was mixed and thought of them afterwards... Cap VC is still there almost front and center from just smelling it. Definitely going to need to steep both of these batches. But as a shake and vape it seems closer to the original than batch 1. The mouthfeel is a lot closer, it's still missing an almost chalky sensation though. Maybe Malted Milk? TFA doesn't list any components for this though. I'm going to have to order some more TFA flavors, especially Maple Flavor. My gut is the Cyclotene is a key in the recipe. And the more I vape the original the more I'm convincing myself I get a maple flavor from it. And, TFA says the Cyclotene has ""nutty nuances"" that might be where the nuttiness from the original comes from.   Not sure where I got the TFA Fresh Cream from though since they don't make one. Thinking I typed that instead of French Vanilla. And I might sub the Cap VC for Vanilla Bean Ice Cream depending on how it steeps.  btw, sorry /u/ju1ceboxx for hijacking your discussion into my own quest to make a clone."
DIY_eJuice,3dy6go,seratne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"No worries, you're doing awesome work here! I think you're onto something with the cyclotene though. There is a definite nuttiness to the OG that I can't replicate otherwise."

If on the other hand those are all of your supplies that's a rather small supply resource so I wouldn't say you overdid it there.   If anything welcome to the world of diy.

DIY_eJuice,3dx03g,Glitchlol,21,Mon Jul 20 06:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'll kick things off. Going to give a blood orange creme brulee a crack.  Starting off with the first hit from google...   1 cup blood orange juice, plus the zest of one orange ¼ cup sugar 2 cups heavy cream 4 egg yolks 3 tablespoons sugar   As far as oranges go, FW Blood Orange is going to win hands down. I know some people don't like that it separates, but after a good spin through the magnetic stirrer at 55'c, I haven't had it come undone on me yet. I'm thinking of starting at 5%, maybe introducing some FA Orange if I need more orange flavour.  I don't want this custard to be too sweet, but TFA Strawberry ripe at 0.5-1% will be perfect here amongst all the heavy creamy flavours. At a low percentage, it should just add a subtle sweetness..  Cream, hmm. I need that dense heavy sort of cream, so I think TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust will work really well here at 2%. I'd use Bavarian cream, but I think this will add more complexity and I really love the smell of it.  I really want the orange to blend well with the custard, so I think FA custard here is a no brainer. I'll drop in 2%. If the Cheesecake GC doesn't carry the depth far enough, I might add 5-6% CAP Vanilla Custard V1 for that creamy sweet diketone goodness.  So that's given us all a bit of an idea of the components. That sugar towards the end is going to be TFA brown sugar extra at 0.25% and FW Salted Caramel at 2% to give that burnt sugar taste.   Sooo... we have...  Bloody Brûlée!   5% FW Blood Orange 5% CAP Vanilla Custard V1 2% FA Custard 2% TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust 2% FW Salted Caramel 0.5% TFA Strawberry Ripe 0.25% TFA Brown Sugar Extra   I'll mix it up now and let you know how it goes!  I really wish I had FA Joy to mess around with for this, maybe I'll score some at ECC next month :)"

LET'S DO FUCKING CUSTARDS THEN  *I AM GONNA SWEAR THROUGHOUT, DRUNK GUY ON DECK  So I sell juice to my buddies because smoke shops are expensive and blah blah blah.  My buddy Michael shot me a text and was like hey, I need a new juice. I asked him what he was looking for, he said surprise me, but call it Gypsy Tears. I was like ok, what the fuck do gypsy tears taste like?  So I looked at my list of flavors that I already sold to them, looked at all that I had left ever, and said fuck it, gypsy tears taste like peaches n cream.  The initial recipe (all TFA/TPA):  6% Juicy Peach  2% Sweet cream  2% DX Bav Cream  I handed him the juice, he gave me some cash, and he went on his way. I decided maybe I should QC this juice and make sure it isn't shit and I tasted it and immediately said, liquid, you piece of shit, that's not done yet. Followed by a text from my buddy saying it was awesome and two other guys wanted some. So, Gypsy Tears v1 was stuck.  I made their juice, then made up another one that would become v2  7% Juicy Peach  2% Sweet cream  2% DX Bav Cream  2% Cheesecake Graham crust  This was more what I was looking for, but it was still a creamy flavor, and this post is about custards right? So after selling a bunch of my v2 and vaping it like a madman over the course of a couple weeks, I decided to shelf it because I was sick of it.  I made it to order, but I wouldn't touch the stuff.  After trying to find some new custardy flavors as my bottle of vanilla custard was out, I landed on getting whipped cream, vanilla bean ice cream, and marshmallow to try.  When I opened the vanilla bean ice cream I knew exactly where it would make its home, and v3 was born:  7% Juicy Peach  2% Sweet cream  2% DX Bav Cream  2% Cheesecake Graham crust  1% Vanilla Bean Ice Cream  The hint of vanilla and the hefty flavor of the ice cream sent this recipe over the top for me. And that is how I changed the flavor of a Gypsy crying in the gutter to a peaches and custard, a peach cobbler with ice cream on top, and my current all day vape.  Fin"

DIY_eJuice,3dx03g,Darren6560,2,Mon Jul 20 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"So I'm still questing after my ultimate Custard recipe. I have trouble tasting strawberries so all of the Mothers Milk, Unicorn Milks, etc, just don't do it for me. On top of that, plain old vanilla custards, unless they are well spiced, are meh to me.  I enjoy my Vicious Vanilla recipe which includes some custard, but I'd consider that more of a Vanilla Cream recipe than a Vanilla Custard even though you taste some custard notes.  I've been working on a Berry Custard since discovering FLV Boysenberry and I think it's finally getting close.  So I decided to cut the crap and start from scratch after playing around with this variation on Looper. For some reason, as good as FA Meringue is, I just can't vape the stuff as an ADV.  I started very simple with this one just using the good old CAP Vanilla Custard V1 as my custard base and adding in my Boysenberry. Honestly, just the two of those together makes a great simple vape, but it's just not good enough for me. One thing that was definitely missing was layering of the Boysenberry so I proceeded to add one of my favorite ingredients, INW Raspberry Koncentrat (Malina) and a splash of TFA Strawberry (ripe).  On next tasting it was very very good but was lacking a little bit in sweetness. I proceeded to add a little EM (10%) solution, as well as some TFA Toasted Marshmallow to round things out and add a bit more sweetness. I chose toasted marshmallow here cause I love the stuff, but TFA Marshmallow or FA Marshmallow still need to be tried.  Lastly, after aging and taste testing that it, it was lacking a little pop for the berries and missing just a little bit of the fullness that I still wanted it to have. I decided to use MTS Vape Wizard to add some fullness and knowing that it would take the edge of the custard a little, which should allow the berries to shine through a bit more. It did take the edge off the custard, while I don't think it muted the berries, they still weren't quite as tart as I wanted them now that the custard base had been sweetened up.  Last addition was a splash of Citric Acid to tarten those berries and finish off the full mouth feel.  In the end I wound up with:  Berry Custard V0.6 6% CAP Vanilla Custard V1 1.25% FLV Boysenberry 1.5% TFA Toasted Marshmallow 0.5% TFA Strawberry (Ripe) 0.25% INW Raspberry Koncentrat (Malina) 0.25% Citric Acid (10%) 0.25% MTS Vape Wizard (10%) 0.25% EM (10%)    Pretty damn close to where I want this thing now. I've thought about adding some crust to it via a splash of TFA Pie Crust or some Graham Cracker but I just don't like how that's played with Boysenberry in the past for me. Still need to try other Marshmallow variations, thinking TFA Marshmallow, and that may allow me to drop the EM and maybe even the CA as well.  Mixed MAX VG with 3% Distilled Water for wicking purposes. Requires 7-10 day steep for the true custard flavor to round itself out and appear the way I want it to be. Haven't had it steep beyond 2 weeks yet as I haven't mixed a large enough batch.  Enjoy everyone!  Edit: If you like your flavors strong, you probably need to bump this all up by 25-50%. As it stands, it's a nice, light, all day custard vape for me."

I ordered something called 60's tobacco without realising it is marijuana flavour. Well, he vaped it. His favourite blend became 2part 60s tobacco and 1part honey.  Still, he did not want fruit. I made ry4 with apple and/or strawberry blends that were ""not too bad"" (I.e. shit).  This was my try to make a custard he'd like.   4% vanilla custard Cap 1.5% seven leave tobacco FA   This makes for a wood scented, slightly earthy custard with hints of fresh cut grass. He didn't like it, I do.  Edit: Forgot the reasoning as to why I used FA 7leave instead of ry4. Never mixed it like this, just my thoughts.  RY4 tfa; too much caramel and vanilla notes, it would not have the floral tobacco I was after.  RY4 iw;  too dark, deep of a flavour, I wanted something more light, playful."

He is using it at 1.5% in a mix. That means the mix would only contain 0.3% EM. Sounds like the perfect amount of EM to use without suffering from the flavor muting aspect. I say leave it in.

DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,neonstereo,3,Mon Jul 20 10:49:13 2015 UTC,"1.26 g/cm³ is not mass, it is the specific gravity. Specific gravity is basically the density at a given temperature, usually 22 C. This explanation could very well be part of the problem you are having. For instance, if your environment, which is affecting the temperature of the liquid, is not at 22 C then 1.26 g of VG will most likely not equal 1 ml (same as cm³). It is also possible that even if your room temperature is correct, the temperature of your liquid is not. For instance, if your VG just arrived and was traveling around in the cold it could take as long as days, depending on the amount, for it to equalize to room temperature. Either way as long as you are mixing everything by SG, and not SG and some stuff in volume, everything should be fine; When the end product returns to 22 C, or whatever the SG is measured at and assuming it's mixed well, you should still have the right amount in volume.  Note: I am not a scientist so if a scientist, or other educated person, is reading this and sees an error in my explanation please feel free to correct me."
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,nmsmith89,4,Mon Jul 20 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"That's a very good explanation. In summary of the replies above, it is either increase in water content or a temperature differential.  Another variable may be a completely separate chemical added into the VG?  How does it taste?  And how does the consistency compare?"
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,VapeClarity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you and yes, this explanation is assuming the SG is really 1.26; If water or another liquid is present either due to bad processing or by ""cutting"" it then the MSDS provided is an obvious lie."
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,nmsmith89,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:23 2015 UTC,I completely trust the new VG as it's from a reputable pharma company. So it comes down to how much I trust the old VG and whether or not it may be 'cut' with something.  My concern now is the accuracy of my recipes and how they will translate to the new VG..
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,nmsmith89,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"PS: This is not only true for your VG but for basically every flavor, additive, and liquid you are using."
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,nmsmith89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, this part I already understand (even though I called the specific gravity as mass).  I don't measure anything by volume, only ever by weight.  So I made two bottles using the same recipe (a recipe ive made many many times before). One using the new VG and one using the old VG and they came out to a noticeably  different volume.  Temperature should not have played much of a part in it, especially at such low amounts, but regardless both VG's were sitting in the same room and similar vessels so I can't imagine their temperature as being very different.  What  I guess I'm curious to know is if anyone has encountered VG at a SG different to 1.26g/cm3 before?  I tried to do some tests tonight and I measures the old VG and new one and did some tests where I heated them to 20c and then measures 1ml and 100ml amounts and they both came to the same weight.  It's really doing my head in as to why they came out different!"
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,Dark_Jinouga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:14 2015 UTC,It could very well be that the VG you previously had was a substandard product. In addition there are a countless number of uncontrollable variables that could lead to every batch to vary ever so slightly. If the difference in volume isn't that much I wouldn't worry about it
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,Dark_Jinouga,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"only theory i have is the newer VG is more ""pure"" then the one you had before. more water in it decreases its density, IE giving it more volume for the same weight"
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,aaa12585,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:33 2015 UTC,"So do you think that my new VG is likely to be more accurate?  I don't have any background info or MSDS data about the old VG being honest, but the new one is direct from a pharma company distributor (the product is Palmera 995)."
DIY_eJuice,3dxkfr,apolonious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:00:48 2015 UTC,"I would think so, as water has a lower density then VG, the purer the VG is the denser it will be (and the lower its volume per 100g)"

I appreciate the time and effort that it took to put the list together but there are some really bad recipes in there. It's also the most up voted post in this sub's history. You can go back to the original post and there little or no discussion as to the quality of any of them. That's mostly due to the short lifespan of a reddit thread. Hopefully we can keep this one going with some reviews and revisions.

DIY_eJuice,3duntd,dehydratedchicken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:23 2015 UTC,I took a lot of recipes from the original thread where these came from. I definitely  like the format they're in here better than the old one.
DIY_eJuice,3duntd,McHairpie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:03 2015 UTC,I actually found the brown sugar to be too overpowering and a coil destroyer. Then again I've never had the original so don't know how it's supposed to taste but I did end up binning that mix
DIY_eJuice,3duntd,McHairpie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:41 2015 UTC,Really dont think the brown sugar was the problem. I'm gonna mix it again at 2% butterscotch and drop the cream to around 3%. I'm thinking whoever posted the old thread made a serious typo or two on that one.

DIY_eJuice,3duntd,McHairpie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:47:51 2015 UTC,Huh. I've never tried the juice this was cloned from. It just sounded good so I mixed it. The butterscotch was almost undetectable around the other stuff. Which is usually (from what I've read here) caused by using too much flavoring. I've made other recipes with half as much butterscotch and it was more prominent there. I'm also still fairly new to mixing and I'll admit that I'm not that familiar with the optimal %'s for all of the flavorings I've acquired.
DIY_eJuice,3duntd,Anemiatic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:41 2015 UTC,I'll keep an eye out for your results :)
DIY_eJuice,3duntd,overachiever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:52 2015 UTC,I decided to cut all of the flavorings by 50% instead of my original plan. Which made it exactly 100% better than it was. Mixed at 70/30 vg/pg with about a 24 hour steep. I'll be vaping this for the rest of the night.

That could just be your decision about how you want flavors represented simplistically, which is your preference. You have a relatively nice acronym ""BCV"" you could work with. The contrast with ""Bridge City"" and ""VAPE"" seems a bit jarring (from a typography standpoint) and could be a little more smooth. Also I feel Bridge City Vapor or Vape Co. seems to flow a bit easier.   Just a few of my immediate thoughts. Best of luck with everything."

Bridge City Vape Co. Does have a RI g to it and I will think about adding the Co. My only hesitation is my OCD, if I did go with the addition of Co. then I would feel the need to change my urls & handles to match it. Anyways, thank you for the critique!   Edit: how would you consider smoothing the contrast between BC &V? I was thinking of thickening the stroke around the fonts and maybe positioning them differently in combination with the bridge."

However, I've purposely given each recipe a tab so as not to have row-after-row of information. For me it's more digestible to have a menu (which is to the left of the tabs on the bottom), so I can browse the contents of the document, choose an item, then view its information isolated from all the other information.  Its definitely a work in progress. As I build it out I may end up combing individual user recipes on one tab (if it doesn't take away from the navigation point of view I'm trying to create).

I'd love to make some different juices with a number of these attributes without a direct correlation to the flavor.

I did a little more reading and it seems that that the flavour and pungency are unique to isothiocyanates, of which there are weaker ones (brussel sprouts, radishes, watercress).  But either way, it seems the burn and the flavour are a package deal.  Now that you've narrowed down what you're looking for, maybe post over in /r/Deeper_DIY to see if someone smarter can help you out?

Really another level to vaping in general if it could be applied without changing taste.

DIY_eJuice,3dwops,DrKickflip13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:54:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah good luck with DIY, it's really fun and you'll learn a lot in the process. As far as the recipe, looks like it should be pretty tasty! If I remember correctly, TFA Cotton Candy is a 10% EM mix already (the first ingredient) so that might be the easiest option. It's one way to add sweetness to a mix without using the harsher sweeteners.   EDIT - To clarify the EM thing, because that was confusing to me when I started, he uses a 10% EM solution but mixing it at 1% of the juice. The Flavoring Apprentice has a cotton candy flavor that's 10% EM suspended in PG. Using 1% of that would be the same as using 1% of a 10% EM solution...they're the same thing. Hope that makes sense!"

DIY_eJuice,3duh6s,McHairpie,3,Sun Jul 19 21:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's so hard with tobaccos because everyone seems to have different tastes. I really like the ECX Tobaccos - Desert Ship, Cigar, Captain, Black Mile and Black Mile Plus, French Pipe to name a few.   TFA RY4 Double is one that everyone seems to like and there are a lot of recipes out there that use it.  FA has some nice flavors - FA Tobacco, Maxx Blend and 7 Leaves.   For ""nutty"" tobaccos I like ECX Real Cig and INW Tobacco Symphony.   And lastly for something along the analog lines (although I don't think they taste a thing like an analog) I like INW S'Camel with a little bit of INW DNB added."

I wanted to recommend that based on what I've read about backwood's brew's casablanca flavor but haven't been able to grab it myself to compare.  This may sound odd for the OP, but I wonder about going in the opposite direction of sweet--flavors like Oakwood, or Amber. And since nuts seem to pair so well with beer, any nut-heavy blends, especially if you find ones that go more salty than sweet."

(trialling strawberry ripe (TFA?) just now and its pretty nice)   These two mix very well together for a very nice SB. Use the Ripe for the smell and the CAP for the flavor. So a little more Ripe than CAP. You might be surprised at how the smell of Ripe will alter your perception of the CAP SB. 4-5% and 3-4% respectively is where i am at on a couple recipes.

DIY_eJuice,3duhol,skiddlzninja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"Try dropping it to 1-2% and see how it steeps out. I'm guessing you make small bottles so they don't last more than a week, but the best way to see what your flavors do is to make two bottles, one with the 5% and one with 1.5% and set them aside for a week while you make other flavors to vape immediately.  This will really help if you plan on making flavors for others, as their vaping habits may not be the same as yours, and you will have to worry about how your flavors mature."

DIY_eJuice,3duhol,catdumpling,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"Here's my Strawberries & Cream thing, minus the cream part. Should still be pretty tasty.    6% TFA Strawberry Ripe  0.75% TFA Strawberry  3% TFA Marshmallow  2% TFA Vanillin  2.5% TFA Sweetener (sucralose)   Note that I like a sweeter vape, so you may want to use less sweetener. The marshmallow also adds some sweetness, but I'd lower (or remove) the sucralose first. Anything much above 2.5% sucralose and it starts getting a noticeable ""artificial sweetener"" flavor.  I personally think Strawberry Ripe gets a little floral-y after a few days if you use too much, so it looks like something in the 6%-7% range is right on with most of us. Otherwise this is pretty much a shake-and-vape for the most part, so there's no long steeping required (I give all my mixes a hot water bath or two after I mix, but otherwise I don't really steep anything.)  EDIT: If you want a strawberry-peach vape, just add about 1.25% of TFA Peach (Juicy). I'm still tweaking that recipe, but it's pretty good so far and is just a slight variation on this."

DIY_eJuice,3dtrwa,VapeQueen214,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:31:24 2015 UTC,Unfortunately i have never tried it. Are you sure theyre using berry crunch? They also posted a list of flavor syggestions and they mentioned they dont use a lot of berry crunch because it can get corn-chippy at high amounts. I severely dis agree with the comment that it is a week flavor. Its not a week at all to me. 3% berry crunch combined with 2% vanilla custard abd various other creams and 1% strawberry ripe gets me a really solid berry crunch recipe. It gets so much better with about 2 weeks of steeping though.
DIY_eJuice,3dtrwa,hotwingsandcoldbeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:08:48 2015 UTC,I found this somewhere and it's my favorite crunchberries recipe. Overall flavor % may be too high for some but I don't focus on numbers since my mouth can't taste numbers.  TFA Berry Crunch 15%  TFA Graham Cracker Clear 2%  TFA Strawberry Ripe 2%
DIY_eJuice,3dtrwa,Discchord,2,Sun Jul 19 11:57:30 2015 UTC,"I've been playing with Berry Crunch a lot over the last few months and I can understand why you went with 15%. It's a relatively weak flavor for TFA. I get a mushroom taste though if I push it past 12%.  I find a drop of EM / Cotton Candy per 10mL helps boost it.   Rounding out the rest of the Berry flavor has been tricky though. I've kind of been banging my head against the wall on that, but fortunately even the failures are super tasty at this point.   I've never had Crunch Addict, so I have no idea what to go for on the cream base. My favorite so far with Berry Crunch is 0.5% FA Cream Fresh, and 0.5% TFA Malted Milk. It's pretty solid after a 24 hour steep."

In this recipe I'd try probably a 4/2 or a 6/3 depending on how much you want the strawberry to come through. Add 0.25-0.50% Dragonfruit (any more than that and the DF overwhelms the strawberry imo) and you're golden.
DIY_eJuice,3dtpzb,frizzyburr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Your problem might the strawberry ripe and bav cream. Original bav cream has >10% ethyl maltol, which mutes flavors, I believe the DX has it too. Strawberry ripe has a buch of maltol which has the same effect. I also have trouble tasting strawberry ripe in my recipes.  I have similar problem in a straw ripe + bav cream recipe. I haven't tried this yet (awaiting my shipment), but asking and lurking led me to believe that blending a different strawberry in like TFA Strawberry, or replacing the ripe entirely might help. Also going with even slightly less bav cream can help. That stuff is basically flavored ethyl maltol."

DIY_eJuice,3duoja,altneurose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:20 2015 UTC,Ok I have been looking up this additive and seen that it can also dull flavors. It seems to be tricky for some people. I have some on the way and was wondering what makes it such a double edged sword.
DIY_eJuice,3duoja,chumchumsqueal,2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:11 2015 UTC,"I do not know which one you referred to.  Triethyl citrate was tested in the deeper diy section by /u/captaincannibal here, and pre_analysed by /u/abdada here.  Triacetin is used as a carrier for other aromamolecules. It changes the mouthfeel and possibly reduces steeping times. It ""mutes"" flavours the same way propylenglycol does, if you dilute something too much you are not gonna taste it prominently."
DIY_eJuice,3duoja,ihatetoridethebus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:32:02 2015 UTC,"what kinds of fruits are you using?   I find LA Peach can round out some of the top end notes that some citruses have, use sparingly though if you don't want the actual peach flavor. Maybe start at 2 drops/10 ml"
DIY_eJuice,3duoja,___on___on___,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:29 2015 UTC,I add 1-2% coconut to most of my fruit mixes. It rounds out the mix well in my experience.   Heres my ADV for the past few weeks TFA Grape Juice 7% TFA Acai  6% TFA Bluberry Wild 3% Lorann Coconut 2%

DIY_eJuice,3dsygm,Vapespin,2,Sun Jul 19 05:33:32 2015 UTC,"The only reason hazelnut is in there, is to try to capture a little bit of nutty/grainy flavor of the oatmeal along with the AP. I'd have used INW almond as /u/abdada suggested but I didn't have it.  Other than TFA Peanut Butter, that's the only nut flavor I've got.   So if you've got almond, use that."

It is actually fairly common for manufacturers of any solution (not just eliquid) that is meant for storage to add citric acid at the end of the formulating process. Solution is made under batch volume, citric acid is added, and then brought up to batch volume."
DIY_eJuice,3dt8cj,1800fullytorqued,3,Sun Jul 19 05:52:35 2015 UTC,"/u/MineDogger is correct – anything more than 1% is way too much. To me it tastes like lip balm when mixed to high.   You should not be getting any sort of menthol or mint taste, though. What's the Polish name on your bottle and where did you get it from? Should be Czarne Jagody."
DIY_eJuice,3dt8cj,fizzmustard,2,Sun Jul 19 11:32:35 2015 UTC,Inawera Blueberry? Its the business... But you don't want to use more than around 1% because its stupid strong.

DIY_eJuice,3dt8cj,MineDogger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:58:43 2015 UTC,"It has a strong odor, but if your nose isn't used to super-high flavor concentrates you may just be confusing the strong tart/sour scent with menthol... Otherwise I'd have to think that either the bottle is mislabelled, (possible if repacked by someone like Ecigexpress,) or there's been some cross contamination with another flavor. I use plastic syringes for a lot of flavors but some stronger flavors don't wash out. Unless you're mixing by weight, menthol, tobaccos and oil based flavors ""get around"" if you don't have glass measuring tools or you mix up your syringes."
DIY_eJuice,3dt8cj,guntherslunt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"It was from ECX,  so repackaged, possibly mislabeled, but it has a dropper top so no cross contamination.  I'll play around with it more at lower percentages and see if it's better.  Thanks for the info."

DIY_eJuice,3dt7x1,KeggsNA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:46:24 2015 UTC,"I think you get the most for your money by skipping starter kits , a lot of the stuff is not needed .  I recommend going to ECX and read the reviews of the flavorings that appeal to you , the users of these flavors really explain what the flavors really taste like, recommended starting points etc  , I like BullCityVapor for ordering as they ship really fast and prices are very good , i recommend you go with flavors from either TFA,  FlavorArt or Capella's  , all are very good .  Buy flavors that cater to your favorite recipes not flavors that you are very unlikely to ever use."
DIY_eJuice,3dt7x1,surffishman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:58:26 2015 UTC,Is there a thread with a list of stuff I would need to get started? I like the idea of buying flavors separately.

DIY_eJuice,3dt7x1,surffishman,0,Mon Jul 20 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"All you need is:  This is the bare minimum you need by the way .    1-  A bottle of your preferred nic % in the PG/VG you like .  2-  A measuring cup in ml  3- Your preferred flavoring in small sample bottles  4- Empty juice bottles to hold your new mixes  Thats exactly what i started with and i spent very little $$,  made lots of juice with just the above."

DIY_eJuice,3dryv1,treesnbongs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:12:35 2015 UTC,Nice! I saved that post. I like your method of comparing the volatiles. I was spending a lot of time on TFA's CSA listings this morning for a different recipe. You can really learn a lot about a flavor when you see how it shares similar qualities with others. I know way more about artificial *berry flavoring today than I did yesterday.
DIY_eJuice,3dryv1,MrsCustardSeesYou,4,Sun Jul 19 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a very helpful tool that TFA has put together, and one of the reasons I used their flavorings the most. It's obvious that they realize transparency is extremely important in this industry; something that other vendors really need to emulate."

DIY_eJuice,3dryv1,zenergy1321,2,Sun Jul 19 19:33:37 2015 UTC,This is so true. I bought 4 oz. in my last TFA order because of how much it is used here. I hadn't even heard of the fucking fruit before I started vaping.

DIY_eJuice,3dt23e,lvanDrago,4,Sun Jul 19 04:32:56 2015 UTC,That is roughly right to me. Problem is drops are different sizes based upon different bottles and tops/drippers
DIY_eJuice,3dt23e,Vapespin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on the bottle you use for drops.  Essentially, the weight per drop depends on the size of the drop; there's no one you can ask that can give you the best answer."
DIY_eJuice,3dt23e,skiddlzninja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"You can just weigh 150 drops and divide by 150 and use that as a starting place... I suspect that even coming out of the same bottle using the same liquid, not all drops are the same size (depending on how fast you're squeezing them out, e.g.), so mbw wins again."

Do mix up the clone you found, it's really not bad. If you like it, that's it! :) My recipe has same ingredients anyway if I ever get there. And like joshualeet said, cheap, cheap, cheap. The best part of DIY for me is that unless you really screw up, at least you'll have something half decent to vape and it costs pennies.  Hell, in a pinch to get more juice and no ""easy"" recipes / flavors for them on hand, I hastily mixed two flavors I liked with eyeballed percentages (+pg, vg and nic). Shake, and I suddenly had a 10 ml of not perfect, but perfectly vapable juice with my preferred vg/pg/nic ratio. That 10 ml cost me about half a dollar and took 5 minutes to make."

DIY_eJuice,3doyi0,VapeQueen214,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:08 2015 UTC,"For cutwoods monster melons, its simply TFA papaya, cantaloupe, and mango. I think theirs is super over flavored maybe 25% but the recipe I make is a lighter and not sickenly sweet recipe. I use 4% of cantaloupe and mango and 3% papaya and that shit is potent. Although that recipe is good, tfa mango and cantaloupe are very weak flavors. I REALLY love Capellas mango and sweet guava. With watermelon LA definitely has the best candy type flavor, personally I use a combination of a small amount of capellas sweet watermelon and tfa's at about 8-10% since its slightly light. With tfa's strawberry ripe its a good flavor, but is very potent and can tend to have a green taste if you use too much. I like to combine abour 1-2% with other strawberries like TFA'S or Ca's sweet strawberry. Another good tropical flavor is TFA jackfruit, Tfa's pineapple is pretty good at low percents. Capellas has a good cucumber, inw cactus is magic. FA citrus mix and forest fruit are amazing too that I have really been digging lately. You can find this all of the sidebar but Im bored today so i hope this helps lol."
DIY_eJuice,3doyi0,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:36:13 2015 UTC,Man I love TFA jackfruit. As for the Pineapple man this stuff is harsh on the throat. I find 1% too muchso I tried 0.5% and its still too much.

DIY_eJuice,3doyi0,VapeQueen214,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:46 2015 UTC,"Looks good. Only thing i havent tried is fa mango, but their mangosteen is on point. With the FA flavors start really low with the percentages and work tour way up. Theyre alot more concentrated so i typically use anywhere between .5-2% typically. I rarely go over 3 % on any of their flavors except for fa lemon sicily. Yeah tfa jackfruit is a must and i forgot to mention fa coconut is also the best coconut i have tried. But youll be ordering more flavors soon anyways haha, it never seems to be enough."
DIY_eJuice,3dmd0l,Lavalamb,2,Fri Jul 17 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"That's almost 30% flavoring, that's probably too high - depending on the flavor and your palette of course, but I'd suggest starting at 15% or so..  edit: just remembered reading that most of MBV is good at 20%. 20% flavor goes as follows:  If you want your amount of base to yield 5x50ml juices:  50 ml base + 12 ml flavoring  If you want to use a whole 20 ml bottle of flavor per juice:  80 ml base + 20 ml flavoring"
DIY_eJuice,3dmd0l,altneurose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"The concentrates are things like hawk sauce, thug juice.

I know it is cheaper for me to do it this way, but I'm not sure what prices you are paying on your side of the pond for these materials."
DIY_eJuice,3dmd0l,subarutim,2,Fri Jul 17 16:39:10 2015 UTC,You can do it even cheaper if you buy the vg and pg separately. Also you will want to look into individual flavor suppliers eventually like TFA (the flavor apprentice) CAP (Capella) and many others. I'm making juice at $.04 per ml right now. Another major benefit to individual flavors is that you can experiment and find recipes to modify to create your own masterpiece. Good luck.

Depending on how much juice you plan to make, an alternative to having them printed for you is print them yourself. I've found this particularly useful because you can print on demand, meaning you aren't stuck with too many of one label and not enough of another.   Highly Reccomended: Avery sells sheets of printer-friendly labels, both glossy and matte, and they have an online design center that is actually quite useful. You can buy their labels at most major stores, such as Walmart.  Now, I can tell you I've gone through TONS of ink, but my labels are very colorful and I'm definitely starting to expand. At the start it was a great option for quick, easy, instantaneous results. I'm moving on to having my labels printed elsewhere now. Still keeping some of those Avery labels on hand just in case I need them in a pinch.  EDIT: Oh! And if you chose to use this method, ALIGN YOUR PRINTER FIRST! Trust me, it's frustrating when you print out a sheet of glossy, beautiful labels, only to find them ruined by one rouge streak."

Another flavor I'm sellin btw. If you want more Banana you can kick it up to 3% or drop peach down to 1%. But otherwise this is more peach heavy so I wouldn't touch the % on that. If anything you can lower it and add whatever else you'd like. A touch of Koolada gives it a smoothie taste. Great shake and vape but I would steep at least a couple days.   A little recipe I had when I told everyone about my cereal recipe. It's my favorite Peach and Cream to date. Just take out the banana if you don't want to use any.

Then again, like /u/skiddlzninja said, it's not a bad idea to have a few sizes of syringes handy - just in case your scale does crap out.

Think we could move 2-3 liters? =)  $5.00 for a 15ml ($0.333/ml) $9.00 for a 30ml ($0.30/ml) $27.00 for a 120ml ($0.225/ml)    BCV is $3.49 for a 10ml ($0.349/ml)  (no other sizes) when they have it in stock...

I'd happily pay more than online prices to get something today.   Cause even at ridiculous mark up, they make very little on it and require a much larger inventory to be effective compared to stocking and selling juice to the public. On top of that, the market is much much much smaller locally.  Only way it really makes sense for a retail shop to offer DiY supplies is two possibilities.  1.) They make their own juice in house and aren't opposed to having large stock of flavors they don't use in current lines. 2.) They have a reasonable online presence for DiY supplies and offer retail to pair with the rest of their business."

DIY_eJuice,3dl4te,mayor-of-whoreisland,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"I know strawberry ripe contains higher amounts of EM compared to regular, so it may be flavor muting caused by the EM, but it usually doesn't show up after only an overnight steep :/  I used 3% strawberry ripe and dropped the regular strawberry 3% in mustard milk because I enjoy the mix, so I don't see anything wrong with using straight strawberry ripe.  As for other strawberries, I wouldn't suggest CAP, from what I've tasted it's just a worse TFA strawberry. Doesn't add anything unique to a mix except making it taste bad. Hangsen's makes a pretty interesting strawberry, and FA always has great flavors; their strawberry is no exception."

I'm majorly into a lemon kick lately so I'll play around with a couple variations of this and report back.  Have a feeling I'll like the FW Yellow Cake a little bit higher (4-5%) and drop the custard down or out or replace it with a little bit of FA Custard. I made add some alternative lemon as well.

DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,Botboy141,3,Fri Jul 17 01:14:56 2015 UTC,"Catalan has spices to it moreso than lemon. FA Custard has a lemon note to it though as well.

Lastly, really wanting to get some FA Joy in as I think that'll play well with it also.  I'll shake and vape it here in a few minutes and report back.  Edit: Some LA Cream Cheese Icing could possibly send this thing over the top. Unfortunately, I'm completely out and forgot to add some more to the order that just arrived from them today...Am hint of TFA Brown Sugar Extra may also add some bakedness around the edges, maybe 0.2-0.4%."

To me, it added to the butter notes, and gave that mouth feel like you've just swallowed a mouth full of buttercream icing. That sounded wrong, but you get the idea. Haha. Anyone else ever use this flavo? Thoughts?"
DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,McHairpie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:10:12 2015 UTC,"I commented on your recipe. That was the inspiration for it, but I haven't been digging the bilberry no matter how much I tried to tweak it and bavarian cream didnt work as well as I thought it would.   As they say, the best ideas come from the ideas of others! Thanks for giving the idea brother. Its still rough but I put it up so we could pick it apart. No quite where I want it yet as a solely lemon cake flavor but it will get there eventually."
DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,spaceghost_n_moltar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"When I first tasted bilberry, I hated it. Wasn't what I expected at all. But after mixing the blueberry lemon cake I fell in love with it. Now I like it in whatever I mix it in. Acquired taste I guess lol.     Glad I could provide some inspiration for ya. I think I'll start messing around with this one again. I'll try your mix without the bilberry and see what i can contribute. I do like the idea of more yellow cake."
DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,Randeum,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:32:00 2015 UTC,"Bilberry smells like cat urine straight from the bottle.  Is this normal?  I actually bought a 10ml right from FA and it smelled this way.  I tossed it, thinking it was a bad bottle.  Just purchased again because of recipes calling for it and this new bottle (from a reseller) smells the same.  Is it just me?  Or will it vape alright?  I'm just to scared to inhale cat-urine flavor into my lungs."
DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,mentive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"lol yea I thought it smelled weird as well when I first got it. Its definitely got an astringent odor. It tastes much more berryish than it smells I promise. To me its a very flavorful, tart, almost sour tasting blueberry. I think the smell is what turned me off when I first started using it."
DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,mentive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:37:57 2015 UTC,I made something similar for a friend who wanted to try something with lemon and vanilla.  4% Lemon TFA 5% vanilla custard TFA 3% yellow cake FW I didn't even try it but it smelled fantastic.
DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,mentive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:14:26 2015 UTC,i have everything but the CAP vc1. the only custard i have is FA custard cream but that's quite a different flavor.

DIY_eJuice,3dkct4,0ptimusRhyme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:39:27 2015 UTC,I made a Lemon Pound Cake Recipe that was pretty damn good. Looks like ours are very similar. I personally LOVE the cake batter taste. It makes it much richer. I still vape this recipe all the time. Good to know someone out there has similar tastes!  https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/370xfd/lemon_pound_cake_pretty_good_first_try/

DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,bowtieler,5,Thu Jul 16 22:51:05 2015 UTC,"You got the wrong scale buddy, sorry to be the bearer of bad news. You need I to be 0.01, 500g is more than enough max weight for even a fairly large bottle."
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,mentive,3,Thu Jul 16 23:35:13 2015 UTC,It wont make a major difference when you are measuring a very large batch (100ml+). It can make a dramatic difference when measuring a 10ml batch where 0.06mg would be two drops versus 3.5 @ 1.0mg/ml.
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,Botboy141,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's a good point that I didn't think of.   Maybe I'll try tinkering with adding fraction of a drop (ie adding a small enough portion where the tenths place digit doesn't increase). Do you think that it might be enough to offset the difference? Or should I just go ahead and return this scale and get the other?   Ninjedit: Thinking about it, even if I want to measure something > 500g, chances are I'll be able to split it up and measure it in different segments - especially since the only thing I plan on using it for is recipe related stuff (whether that's for food or eliquid)."
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,MurderMelon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:23 2015 UTC,You're right about the multiple batches. You should definitely swap it for the more precise scale.
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,surffishman,0,Fri Jul 17 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"Dammit , i have a regular habit of not being the most accurate mixer , sometimes a drop or two off but seems to be OK to me ."
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,Botboy141,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:37 2015 UTC,"As long as it tastes good, nothing else really matters unless you're aiming for consistency cause you are selling."
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,surffishman,0,Fri Jul 17 06:24:05 2015 UTC,"Makes sense , yeah no way i could sell the stuff i make lol.  I was reading about a vendor closing shop and he stated the key to making great juice is all about the right percentages , he said it's very easy to ruin a recipe by getting the percentages wrong .  Makes sense to me , what are your thoughts?"
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,Botboy141,2,Fri Jul 17 06:28:51 2015 UTC,I was reading about a vendor closing shop   ...   he stated   ...   the key to making great juice   Not sure I'd trust a guys opinion on how to make juice when he's out of business...  Correct percentages are just one small piece of the puzzle.
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,serfingusa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:34:13 2015 UTC,Maybe he was hoping others would learn from his mistakes.
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,spaceghost_n_moltar,2,Sun Jul 19 04:34:02 2015 UTC,"Basically it comes down to the accuracy of the scale. If the recipe calls for 0.25g of a flavor, a 0.01g scale will get within 0.02g. A scale that measures to 0.1 has a tolerance of 0.2-0.3g so when measuring small amounts it could be inaccurate enough to ruin the recipie. I would say that if you do anything smaller than 120ml at a time it could be difficult to recreate the exact same thing again. That also means you can't accurately make 15mls just to see if you like a recipie you found.   I'd see if you can return the scale you bought see if they'll work with you."
DIY_eJuice,3dk6t0,iamgr3m,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:21:34 2015 UTC,I went ahead and got the latter since I figured the 4x max weight was more important than the preciseness.    Nope. You want it to be as precise as possible unless you're mixing large batches. Max weight shouldn't be a problem for the average DIY'er. It isn't until you start making larger batches that you need to start worrying about max weight. (As long as the scale goes to 500g at .01 precision you'll be fine)
DIY_eJuice,3djggi,ConvictedConvict,4,Thu Jul 16 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"It is a Canadian based facility and at this time they are only open to wholesale orders (1 liter + sizes). I inquired into the timeframe of them being fully functional and was told 'by the end of summer'.  As it stands right now, I wish I had just ordered from FA-IT as I placed my order manually with the N.A. warehouse 6 days ago and don't even have a confirmation of my order being received yet (despite calling my contact and asking him to confirm the order on Tuesday). They are about a week behind from when you submit an order until they start to process it (IE calculate shipping cost and send you info for a bank transfer). Supposedly, after they send you shipping costs and you send bank transfer though, they can ship next day.  Shipping costs will still be lower coming from CA to the US versus IT to the US, but it's still a hassle.  Additionally, if you're like me, your CC won't be accepted by them and you'll have to send a wire transfer every time for payment.  I placed a $400 order worth of FA flavors from ELM again, despite the pending 5 liter shipment of FA Joy from the new FA-NA facility. Had I been smart, I would have just ordered it all from FA-IT and likely saved money due to the more progressive discount structure. FA-IT has wholesale discounts starting @ 200Eu versus FA-NA starting @ $1000."

Edit: By the way, your guide to mixing by weight has made my DIY endeavors so much easier and enjoyable. I really appreciate people like you who make this community awesome. Cheers!"
DIY_eJuice,3djggi,Jtetsuki,2,Thu Jul 16 20:35:52 2015 UTC,I ordered direct from Italy a couple weeks ago. Didn't take horribly long even with standard shipping. Took a few of weeks.
DIY_eJuice,3djggi,Botboy141,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:51:28 2015 UTC,Yeah it's usually ~2.5 weeks or so with them from when I place an order until it's at my door via their standard DHL shipping.
DIY_eJuice,3djggi,hectomaner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"What sucks even more is once they are up and running, any orders to FA-IT from NA will be pushed through NA, so you will end up paying more and still having to deal with them."
DIY_eJuice,3djggi,Botboy141,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yup yup. I'm sure once the ordering process is streamlined and online it'll be fine. What sucks is, I basically just asked if I should order from N.A. or from IT and they told me to order from N.A. and sent me the form to do so...If I had ordered from IT it would be delivered tomorrow for ~10% higher cost, instead I don't even have confirmation of the order yet."

DIY_eJuice,3djggi,HexCoils,2,Fri Jul 17 00:23:01 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing somewhere that it's up and running, but in Canada, so the person talking about it was bummed as they are in the u.s. and still have to deal with huge shipping fees. Hope this helps you find a more complete answer."

DIY_eJuice,3dkrxd,abdada,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't share that information because of their wholesale policy (which aggravates me because I prefer 100% transparency).  If that's the US price for 4 ounces, there's no profit margin for reselling."

DIY_eJuice,3diq39,Sirhcl04,5,Thu Jul 16 16:24:13 2015 UTC,Try scaling back your percentages a bit and let them steep more.  Less flavor muting/fatigue over time and more flavor in the long run.
DIY_eJuice,3diq39,crosstown_rebel,2,Thu Jul 16 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"Actually sounds pretty damn tasty! but like rebel said, try like 8 or even lower percent each!"
DIY_eJuice,3diq39,Tking012,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say stay around 10-15% total [not each] The flavor will still be amazing. I will be trying the cinnamon cookie icecream one myself  Try  4% TFA Citrus punch (dew drops) 6% TFA Peach (juicy)  4% Vanilla Bean Ice Cream 6% Cinnamon Sugar Cookie  play around to find that sweet spot but I think you're actually losing flavor by adding too much of each  But hay, then again, it's your juice and if you think that is your sweet spot, go for it! Taste is subjective :)  Also, have you considered mixing that juicy peach with the vanilla bean ice cream? I bet you it would be awesomeeee"
