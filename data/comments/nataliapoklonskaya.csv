Thank god Natalia is there in Crimea to uphold the law. Only 2 deaths in Crimea. Much better than the thousands dead just north of Crimea."
nataliapoklonskaya,37t1ne,SiberianShibe,-4,Thu Jun 11 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"You are certainly touched.  Ukraine nor russia has rule of law.  The judges have been apointed by those thieves.  That's the first point.  The second point is that what happened in Ukraine started as a peaceful demonstration to show the government the people where displeased with the current affairs.  It was the police that cracked down on demonstrators and a president that fled.  The democratically elected officials that you so highly spoke of used a democratic process to go back to the people and elect a new president as the current one wasn't coming back to face judgement.   No ideal, but all very democratic."
nataliapoklonskaya,37t1ne,vodkastick,2,Thu Jun 11 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"What an ignorant opinion about rule of law. You obviously don't understand what that means. The police are the law. If you fight them with Molotov cocktails and lethal brick throwing then you are a criminal, not a democratic enthusiast. The president fled for his life because criminal thugs were going to murder him. He couldn't go back because the Rada sure as hell was going to try to save their own skins, seize control, and make him the scapegoat.  Wasn't the demonstrations supposed to be about corruption? Well removing one person from power does not salve corruption. It takes two to tango.   And btw if you think you can have a fair and democratic election directly following an violent uprising, you must not be a very smart individual."

These aren't US gangs remember, these are Russian gangs.  The populace of Crimea are ethnically and culturally Russian. The only reason that Ukraine ever had Crimea is that the man in charge during the dissolution of the USSR was from Ukraine. Ukraine had/s no right to claim ownership of Crimea.

Again, refer to the Budapest Memorandum.  It doesnt matter if the people or the area is ethnically and culturally Russian. By that logic, do you know how many former states the UK could take back? The United States is one of them, because its ""ethnically and culturally"" british. Which makes no sense and is a poor excuse."
nataliapoklonskaya,37t1ne,Zhangar,5,Sat May 30 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"Crimea was not militarily annexed, troops were moved in as a peacekeeping measure - have you seen the violence in eastern Ukraine? In the day, it's the Ukrainian nationalists who oppress the Russians, and at night it flips over.  It should also be noted that Crimea took the vote, Russia didn't force it.  The many of the various peoples of the commonwealth do not identify as British, or English. Neither, in fact is the US anything close to ethnically or culturally British. Given the large number of migrants to the US from south America, Europe, Puerto Rico, I don't think the average US citizen is ethnically British.

I have never said that Crimea was militarily annexed and regarding the violence in eastern Ukraine, everyone knows that the Pro-Separatists are Russians fighting in Ukraine.

I think, however that you need to appreciate your own bias, I know mine. Fact is that this subreddit is one of the few that is at least somewhat sympathetic to Russia. Rest of the world is in support or mildly resentful towards the US. The US isn't a fantastic country, very few are.

So she is not exactly a deserter, or an officer who changed army. She left her ukraninan post w/o any offers from crimean government (which came under russian legistation even later)."
nataliapoklonskaya,37t1ne,masuk0,-5,Sat May 30 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"She kept her position after Russia annexed Crimea and swore allegiance to Russia instead of Ukraine. That is defecting.  Here is the definition of defection, in case you are confused: ""In politics, a defector is a person who gives up allegiance to one state in exchange for allegiance to another, in a way which is considered illegitimate by the first state.[1] More broadly, it involves abandoning a person, cause or doctrine to which one is bound by some tie, as of allegiance or duty"""
nataliapoklonskaya,37t1ne,Zhangar,5,Sat May 30 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"From the point of the duty, she officialy retired from her post. She did not abandoned her duty, she was relieved from it through a proper procedure.  From the point of a state allegiance, you are forgetting about the overthrow. Turchinov's government was illegal, they had no power to remove president, and in particular to assign new prosecutor. What she was supposed to be loyal to was gone and defeated."
nataliapoklonskaya,37t1ne,masuk0,2,Sun May 31 05:58:27 2015 UTC,"She went home to Crimea before it joined Russia.  There was already a bounty on her head because she was a prosecutor assembling files on people who were attacking the police with deadly weapons.  Crimea held a referendum (self-determination was included in the wording of the Ukrainian constitution and it's an international principle anyway).  Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to secede and subsequently joined the Russian Federation.  About a third of the Ukrainian armed forces stationed in Crimea ""defected"" with her.  The ratio in police units was probably much higher.  She's may be badass, but she's a good guy badass."
