4PanelCringe,3dap1k,ScarredCock,4,Wed Jul 15 08:11:57 2015 UTC,"Abs are the result of a low body fat percentage.  Everyone has abdominal muscle. Everyone. It only becomes visible when there's little fat covering it up.  A skinny person does not have this fat, so their abdominal muscles could be exactly the same as an average weight person and still be much more visible.  The saying is pretty accurate. I have plenty of friends who have skinny abs that they have not trained or worked for whatsoever."

4PanelCringe,3dap1k,joosha,3,Wed Jul 15 10:05:50 2015 UTC,I hear a lot of fat strong people use this saying but you need under a certain amount of body fat so saying this means anyone with abs is skinny and it doesn't count

4PanelCringe,3dap1k,ScarredCock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:42 2015 UTC,Skinny≠scrawny. To be skinny you need a low body fat which is also need to have defined abdominal muscles you can be built and still be defined as skinny. To be scrawny you can have a low body fat and abdominal muscles but you can't really be classified as built as you wouldn't have much physical strength. So maybe if the word skinny was replaced by scrawny then I could see were the joke is coming from
4PanelCringe,3dap1k,DUNKA_DUNKA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"So basically what you're saying is, skinny is based on BFP, scrawny is based on BMI?"

4PanelCringe,3dap1k,bryanrobh,-8,Tue Jul 14 22:50:37 2015 UTC,Having a low amount of body fat doesn't automatically mean you also have abs. It is the first step for developing them though

4PanelCringe,3dap1k,bryanrobh,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does. The six pack is the natural definition of the abdominal wall. Training the abs doesn't make them look any different, just bigger. Yes, training abs makes it much easier to see them, but it is not absolutely necessary to do so when you have like 6% bodyfat."

4PanelCringe,39jg4i,skulldan,2,Thu Jul 2 00:49:53 2015 UTC,Can't really do shit about what they learn at school once they're at school unfortunately. My daughter is being home schooled and I put up quite a fight about it with her mother in the beginning. She was adamant about it since she was home schooled and she actually turned out really well. Shit like this is making me see the benefits for it
4PanelCringe,39jg4i,henrokk1,10,Fri Jun 12 13:32:26 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how much you shelter your children, you can't keep them from this kind of stuff, especially after the age of 10.  I'm no where near having kids, I just graduated high school a few years ago. But my parents tried to keep my from this stuff and I speak from personal experience when I say it doesn't work.   The best thing you can do is tell your kids why it is so important to keep their name and face off of what could potentially be embarrassing online. If they wouldn't want their grandmother to see it, they shouldn't put it out there."
4PanelCringe,39jg4i,this_isnt_productive,3,Fri Jun 12 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree. There's not much you can do after a certain point. And it's not like we shelter her like crazy. She still socializes with other kids and goes to soccer practice and ballet and all sorts of group activities. But the fact that she doesn't get dropped off at school for the majority of the day, and effectively the majority of her life, to be raised by teachers and peers does give us more control over how she gets raised. But I digress, I'm just finding myself defending home schooling more and more as my daughter gets older.   But I agree with you, you can't hide shit from them forever and it's better to speak to them instead of shelter them."

Should our society just pretend like people who aren't white don't exist in order to protect little white children (I'm not exactly sure what they need to be protected from)? Should our society go back pretending that people don't have sex because a few parents got lazy?  Why is every fucked up little kid the product of exposure to Miley Cyrus?

He portrays a scene in which the statement is going in one direction by saying i'm not the smartest, strongest etc. BUT, now wait for the joke part of it. at the last minute he takes your perception of where the statement is going. in this case most people will think he will say something long the lines of but i'm still a good guy so date me, but instead he said something you don't expect and here its rape.   so that is how jokes work, if you knew the ending it isn't funny.   i assume you didn't expect the ending to be a rape joke so therefore you didn't see it coming  if you did see that it was gonna end in a rape joke then you should probably see a doctor cause you have a bad case of tumblritus."

Maybe it was when he tried to get affectionate and she rolled her eyes, or when she stopped making the kids go to school if they whined about it. Maybe it was the fact that his 14-year-old daughter outweighed him that finally did it, or when she came out of the closet as a worthless pretentious fuck (a.k.a. ""pansexual"").  We all have our limits. If you're a middle-aged white male like this thing's father, then yours will be tested continually. The presumption is that you'll take it, or, at worst, just disappear.

4PanelCringe,37f11n,EffrumScufflegrit,41,Tue Jun 2 21:44:16 2015 UTC,I don't think there is such a thing as an overreaction when it comes to receiving threats from people who have tracked you down on the internet.  We might not be talking about Mossad but they knew how to get her address. And we know there are plenty of violent crazies out there.  So if she felt threatened enough to move I don't think it's anyone else's place to second guess her.

4PanelCringe,37f11n,thebestwes,9,Thu May 28 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"Serious question: what are the differences between a cheapest shitty tablet and a good one? I can't really imagine that, can someone explain? (I'm asking seriously, not trying to imply that there's no difference)"
4PanelCringe,37f11n,librettomusicale,3,Thu May 28 07:58:41 2015 UTC,"Size, sensitivity, and resolution, as well as a lot more information related to the manner in which you're holding the pen.  The Intuos can measure angle, tilt, and pressure to a very precise degree, which does a lot when you're simulating an actual brush stroke. It's one of those things that you don't really think about until you try painting without the ability to precisely control those things. The Bamboo and other budget tablets just feel... clunky. It doesn't feel like painting naturally, it feels like using a stylus on a trackpad.   In a lot of other products this wouldn't matter so much, but since drawing and painting are very tactile experiences it makes a lot more of a difference than you would think. Something about the feel is just very, very different. I guess that's kind of a shitty answer since it's not very quantifiable, but I've logged quite a few hours on a lot of different tablets and I can assure you it makes a big difference even when using them casually."

I think a lot of those types of peripherals that came out for PCs were often less than stellar unless you went for something which actually cost some bucks. I mean, most of the sketching and paint apps you can get on your iPad for a few dollars these days are infinitely better than the budget line stuff like Bamboo was cranking out."

4PanelCringe,36k3bp,bryanrobh,7,Wed May 20 15:38:04 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously.  Why should anyone be forced to accept these people with their horrible life choices?
4PanelCringe,36k3bp,Afrew,-15,Wed May 20 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Body fat is not a direct indication of health though, and people don't seem to understand that. A high-calorie diet doesn't necessarily mean it's an unhealthy diet, just like how a low-calorie diet isn't inherently healthy either, because there are several other considerations you have to take into account if you actually want to determine a diet as ""healthy"" or not. Granted, people who are ""overweight"" can be at a greater potentiality for certain health risks, but ""overweight"" is fairly subjective anyway, especially since the calculations for determining someone's BMI are practically useless. Some girl on a 1000 calorie per day diet is just as disgusting as some girl on a 4000 calorie per day diet.  Also, the picture has nothing to do with ""life choices"" anyway, it's about accepting physical appearance.   But I'm going to be downvoted anyway because this is the hivemind I'm going against."
4PanelCringe,36k3bp,dijit4l,11,Wed May 20 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"Jesus, you are all over the place.  Body fat is a direct indication of health.  If one is severely underweight or overweight, then you are abusing your body by either under or over eating or exerting too much or too little energy.  It's pretty fucking simple.  I don't know this girl's diet, she may be a devout vegan, but you know what is also vegan?  Refined sugar!  She clearly has put in more calories than she has spent and has done it for long enough to build up that lumpy spare tire.  This girl is way more than overweight, she is morbidly obese and it is a clear case."

4PanelCringe,35l1mv,thebestwes,10,Tue May 12 15:05:28 2015 UTC,"This is potentially going to be more cringe-inducing than the OP, but this isn't emo. That haircut and the shit he's saying is decidedly scene. Emo is much more subdued, and even clean-cut at times. Sunny Day Real Estate is a good example of this, as is early My Chemical Romance. Same with Weezer (Pinkerton was one of the definitive albums of second-wave emo in '96). Heart-on-their-sleeve scene kids have very little in common. I think emo's fashion legacy exists more in the whole metrosexuality thing that was huge in the late 00's than with scene kids, which took over the demographic (whiny, obnoxious 14-year-olds) but had nothing to do with the style."

I'm a bit of a fashion geek, and I get really defensive about emo fashion because 99% of the time people say ""emo"" when they mean ""poser indie hot topic bullshit."" This is the scene aesthetic, and this is emo (or this if you want a more seminal emo example). The closest emo gets to the theatricality and absurdity of scene is probably My Chemical Romance, but many would question whether that's even musically related to emo or if it's just rock-ey hardcore with David Bowie influences."

4PanelCringe,35atl4,Afrew,6,Sat May 9 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to do with being short and young, it has to do with being skinny. Any skinny kid can train a couple muscles to look bigger, but that doesn't mean that those muscles are actually big."
4PanelCringe,35atl4,floor-pi,-4,Sat May 9 14:12:51 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense...the muscles are big in proportion to the rest of his body. So if they look bigger, on his body, then they're big. It's not like a 5'6"" guy can never have big muscles, because they'll always be smaller than a 7'0"" guy's. And that's the thing about delts and upper chest...they're probably some of the hardest muscles for casual gym goers to develop.  I'm not saying that he's big big by any means...but he isn't just skinny, is all."
4PanelCringe,35atl4,Believeyourbeliefs,2,Sat May 9 14:19:51 2015 UTC,He's very skinny. He probably just does push-ups and maybe pull-ups. There's no way he benches over 160.

4PanelCringe,34ugcy,Neuro_Skeptic,-6,Tue May 5 16:37:41 2015 UTC,I think that is an awful lot of trouble to go through just to be verified on a message board to talk about the fat pigs.

4PanelCringe,34ugcy,matisata,-70,Tue May 5 03:06:35 2015 UTC,It appears you have the slanted opinion. Listen fat is wrong and every one knows it. That's all
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,iYokay,47,Tue May 5 03:13:58 2015 UTC,Then help them.  Don't tell them to kill themselves.  And who are you to judge if something is wrong?  Substitute the word fat with gay and hear what you sound like.  Or you could just fuck right off to your hate circlejerk and cry about how all these fatties are mocking your self-righteous hateful opinions on another sub.
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,matisata,0,Tue May 5 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna start off by saying I frequent FPH. This may immediately decide for you whether to downvote this or not, but at least hear me out.   As a someone who is subscribed to FPH and has a lot of ""overweight"" friends, here's my point of view:  I don't hate people for being fat. I hate the attitude of most fatties. If you're fat and you can admit that it's wrong and you're trying to change I have respect for you.   What really bugs me are people such as HAES advocates attempting to glorify obesity just because they're too lazy to fix themselves, so they make excuses so they don't have to feel ashamed about it.   My condolences to overweight people attempting to right themselves, who can admit to having a problem and don't hide behind ""genetics"" or ""obesity is beautiful.""  I would never, never tell anyone to kill or harm themselves, regardless of size, gender, race, etc."
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,bryanrobh,7,Sat May 23 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"You're being ignorant if you're claiming that FPH gives a fuck about whether or not obese people are trying to improve themselves.  FPH is a hate sub, don't try to defend it."
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,matisata,-49,Sun May 24 00:45:36 2015 UTC,I have never told a fat pig to kill themselves. Besides they are doing that all on their own. I have tried to help them. I have given great diet and work out advice. But you can't force someone to take it.   And you can't substitute the fat for gay because being gay isn't a choice.
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,bryanrobh,36,Tue May 5 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"You still call them ""pigs.""  That's not help.  That's petty namecalling.  Giving them advice, however, is helping.  You're still prejudiced against them.  I'm not saying being fat is healthy.  I'm saying you and your sub are hateful bigots, which you are.  Definition of bigot, according to Merriam Webster:  a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. : a bigoted person; especially : a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance  Notice how it doesn't matter if they can help it or not.  (Yes it says especially race or ethnic group but that's because those are the most common types of bigotry)  You're still hating an entire group of people."
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,matisata,-46,Tue May 5 03:40:23 2015 UTC,Yes you are right I hate lazy. And fat people for the most part are lazy. Of course there is that one exception to the rule that can't lose weight but overall there is no excuses.   And even worse is when the fats want people to accept them as the norm. There is nothing normal about it. The lies that Haes and FA spread can be very dangerous to impressionable kids. That is not ok.
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,eversaur,32,Tue May 5 03:46:48 2015 UTC,And even worse is when the fats want people to accept them as the norm. There is nothing normal about it.

4PanelCringe,34ugcy,bryanrobh,2,Wed May 6 00:53:08 2015 UTC,That is.... incredibly shallow. You think you would be completely unhappy with a person you have grown closer to and started to love because they gained weight even if their personality had not changed? What the actual fuck is wrong with you?
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,ftidda,-2,Tue May 12 08:12:04 2015 UTC,I will explain this again.  What is wrong with wanting to be physically attracted to the person you are with?  There is no reason to get fat the older you get unless there is something medical but if it just out of sheer laziness then that is unacceptable.
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,bryanrobh,2,Tue May 12 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"But that isn't what you said, you said if she gets fat you will leave her. There were no caveats about her health declining, you just said you would leave her. There's no issue with wanting to be attracted to the person you're with but once a relationship has started you have to realize how shallow it is to completely write it off because of weight gain."

4PanelCringe,34ugcy,Depressed_Jesus,-3,Sun May 10 02:18:55 2015 UTC,So you think it's ok for someone to let them selves go after they are in a relationship?
4PanelCringe,34ugcy,bryanrobh,-3,Sun May 10 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"Did I ever say that? No, I'm saying you should help your girlfriend lose weight and support her, not just leave her if she ever let herself go."

4PanelCringe,33l81n,chilivanilli,41,Thu Apr 23 17:43:12 2015 UTC,Her great great great great grandfather's daughter's uncle's roommate's best friend's bank-heisting partner that ratted him out's sister's godfather's aunt's cousin might maybe perhaps be related to a black person somewhere. That makes her a strong independent black woman.
4PanelCringe,33l81n,LordDurand,34,Thu Apr 23 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no guesses at all as to what ethnicity she's claiming. She might, in fact, be a white person trying to include herself in things that aren't relevant to her.  Edit: Some light lurking revealed she is Latina. I am also a pale Latina, but the fact is, if you look white, you are effectively white. It's a weird disconnect, being white but having a very Mexican family, but the fact remains. For someone who very firmly believes in white privilege, it's incredible to me that she believes she doesn't benefit from it. My black friends (and Hispanic family) would laugh in my fucking face if I called myself a woman of color. You're white, mija. Lo siento."

4PanelCringe,33l81n,_lilPoundcake,6,Fri Apr 24 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's any person of Latin American descent, which is why it's crazy that she's using it to mean she's not white. My family is mestizo (indigenous and European mix) and is what people tend to think of when they think of Latinos/specifically Mexicans in my case.  Edit for more info: Mestizo Mexicans are very, very thoroughly mixed, so in the same family you can have people who are very dark and very light. My mother is lighter but distinctly non-white, one of my sisters is very dark, one is like my mother, and another, like me, is very light and looks more European."

4PanelCringe,33l81n,_lilPoundcake,6,Fri Apr 24 02:38:52 2015 UTC,"Europeans went around and mixed with absolutely everyone, so there's a lot of diversity in ""white people""! If you're sufficiently white enough, your ethnic/racial background is totally ignored. It's weird being the white sheep in my brown ass family, but that's how it goes, I guess.  I also got the lightest eyes in my family! Mine are hazel and very green, everyone else has different shades of brown. Another weird thing - I look way more like my aunt than my mom.

Kurt was just messing around since Axl was one of those macho metal heads Kurt dispised.  Anyway, after Nirvana played Krist threw his bass in the air and caught it with his face, Kurt was trashing the stage and Dave grabbed the mic, found Axl Rose in the crowd and kept saying ""HI AXL"" really obnoxious-like. They didn't really ""beef"" beyond that, Kurt just thought Axl was a douchebag, which he was."

It was actually Courtney that instigated at the MTV awards, sarcastically asking him to be Francis' godfather, and Axl told Kobain to control his woman, or something to that effect. So it just kind of went from there, and Kobain kept taking potshots at him in interviews after that.  I remember Dave doing the whole ""HI AXL!"" thing after their performance, but at the time, I had no idea what it was all about.

I enjoy history so I thought it'd be fun and interesting. Here's the problem. Whenever someone presented their opinion to an open ended question that the professor asked, someone else would chime in with petty corrections or objections. Which isn't a big deal intrinsically because it was an open dialogue, but the passive aggressive debates would almost always lead 100+ years off topic.  This one guy named Ben would do this odd, almost pecking motion with his neck that coincided with the condescending inflection in his voice as he one-upped everyone constantly.

I don't like who I used to be. Then she started moping around when things stopped going her way and she would be so mean to poor Shinji...yeah, she's cute and usually confident, but she has so much maturing to do."

4PanelCringe,2z3wkt,Maziekit,4,Sun Mar 15 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"EVA SPOILERS:  Asuka being a total bitch to everyone is just her coping mechanism for being unloved and lonely. Nobody ever gave her attention as a child and it completely wrecked her sense of self-worth. To compensate, she became a complete show off and acted superior to everyone else to hide her true sense worthlessness and major self-esteem issues.  She is one of the best written characters in anime history."
4PanelCringe,2z3wkt,daddy1fatsack,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"But she still lacks maturity, right? Yes, she's a complex character, and I suppose she was only 14 or so, but this is how a child handles these problems. It certainly worked within the framework of the story and even the world as a whole, but when you get right down to it, I don't think I'd want to be trapped in a room with her."
4PanelCringe,2z3wkt,Maziekit,6,Sun Mar 15 22:43:55 2015 UTC,"""Maturity"" isn't even a factor when we are talking about intense psychological scarring. Her mother went insane after Eva testing and thought Asuka's doll was actually her daughter. She never spoke to Asuka directly again; always speaking to that doll as if it were Asuka right in front of her face. She then hung herself from the ceiling right in front of her.  Asuka is pretty psychologically fucked up; her character is symbolic of the ways that we all cope with our own insecurities. She learns that her behavior is only making things worse by the end of the series and demonstrates that she can now move on, so I'm not sure what your issue with her is. Evangelion is one of the most powerful and moving works for depressed people that you will find in any medium."
4PanelCringe,2z3wkt,daddy1fatsack,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"I just found myself confused by it more often than not. At this point, I am strongly tempted to rewatch it to get all the things I missed: it was very deep and complex and all the characters felt very human. It's just that every sixth episode or so seemed unnecessarily complicated and obtuse."
4PanelCringe,2z3wkt,Maziekit,2,Sun Mar 15 23:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a very abstract show and incredibly hard to digest, but my god is it beautiful. The End of Evangelion is my favorite movie of all time. The series really and truly changed my life."

Once you get out of the 4chan/reddit womb and into the real world (assuming that ever happens), you'll realize that normal people don't have a special term for people who have a problem with rape, much less act like having a problem with it is somehow something bad.  It's just called not being a stupid asshole."

How do you not notice it when you do that? The actual center of this thing is jokes, not real rape. I really don't understand why this is so upsetting that people immediately equate someone joking about rape to being totally fine with rape. What an insane leap.  If you discourage rape jokes I wonder what else you don't want people to say. Does your life contain any sort of humor? Because I can guarantee that by your own standard you can be seen as an awful person.  But I suppose it's presumptuous of me to assume that you make jokes, ever. I bet a life with half as much joy is magnificent. Also, the real ""stupid a-hole"" is you because of your condescending tone."

They’re not the same thing. If you’re saying “fedora family” you’re referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself.

Enjoying shows like my little pony doesn't make me a loser, it makes me strong for breaking through what people consider 'normal'. Being atheist is liberating, rather than following some false idol that is constantly crammed down society's throats like the dicks you all choke and splutter on daily. Growing what you call a ""neck beard"" shows people that we are too hardcore to conform to what society seems acceptable and how other people see us. Instead of cringing, I stand proud that I have broken through the constrains of modern society while the rest of you are freely being spoon fed the lies that your government are feeding you.

4PanelCringe,2xvv5z,mrtman327,25,Wed Mar 4 17:45:00 2015 UTC,What if someone that's gay was offended by it? Would you tell them to stop being offended for themselves?

Being gay isn't bad, but being mocked with a term for homosexuality, when you are clearly trying to win over women, is still an appropriate response.  In short, no, we don't use gay to mean lame anymore, we use gay to mock punchable/whiteknighting straight men."
4PanelCringe,2xvv5z,CakeBoss16,5,Fri Mar 6 18:05:50 2015 UTC,I just don't see being gay as being beta. Why not just say beta? Gay does not equal beta. Just my opinion

4PanelCringe,2xjkmr,BunsinHoneyDew,-45,Mon Mar 2 19:35:12 2015 UTC,it sounds shitty tho. and why would you waste time typing extra letters?
4PanelCringe,2xjkmr,invisibowl,35,Mon Mar 2 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"Because it sounds odd in a normal conversation flow. This was a force of habit.    Like if someone has a cold people say ""her voice was all nasallly""  it just sounds odd saying ""her voice was all nasal"" or ""she had a nasal voice"".  It just seems to have naturally evolved to be a word like whiney in terms of flow.  That y at the end gives a more natural flow to the word, like if you are speaking Italian.  I guess nasal just shows the Germanic roots of English."

4PanelCringe,2xjkmr,Gallarlove,3,Sat Mar 7 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"""Nasally voice"" - pretty sure voice is the noun here, since it's the object that the adjective (nasally) is describing. Yes, ""nasally"" is actually an adverb so its usage was technically incorrect, but you were incorrect in claiming that ""voice"" was a verb in his sentence.   And I can ""voice"" my opinion, which turns voice into a verb."

That or she's a helluva lot older than she looks. Living with grandma explains a lot though. I just feel sad now. Edit: after seeing that comment below I take it back, whatever her deal is I'm behind her, at least she's not hanging round boards saying: ""I can't stand fat people""."
4PanelCringe,2vb9zj,Comicbook-girl,3,Thu Feb 26 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the fact that she's not making obnoxious comments like that directly relates to her being any less cringey,    I don't think it's learning difficulties,  per se, rather I think this is more a social dysfunction or inability to properly make social connections.     Also,  while the comment was obnoxious by the poster in the link you provided and it adds little to this discussion,  I would like to note that if she took better care of herself it is likely that she'd find more fulfilling social relationships,  since while many people won't say it like that guy did in the link,  on the grander scale being overweight will and does affect your social ranking and interactions.  It's not a conscious and overt response like the poster in your link asserted,  but on a lower level it simply is as things are."
4PanelCringe,2vb9zj,sirgraemecracker,13,Wed Mar 4 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's incredibly condescending and ignorant for you guys to assume she is alone and suffering from mental and social issues simply because she does things you do not like, and lives a life you don't find appealing. At least from what I've seen, she doesn't appear to be depressed. She's just a fat girl who really likes anime and really likes to express herself in ways that most people find awkward or cringey.  Your ideas that she doesn't have ""fulfilling social relationships"", that she doesn't take care of herself, or that she's socially dysfunctional are based on nothing more than assumptions based off of some pictures. You're all acting as if you know her or are her psychiatrist or something. You're hovering above the line between constructive criticism and petty bullying."
4PanelCringe,2vb9zj,oTToMaN77,2,Thu Mar 5 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"You do understand the subreddit we're in right?   It's not really here to be fairy dust and happy kittens.    It is condescending,  because that is somewhat an expectation due to the nature of things that make us cringe.     She doesn't take care of herself.  Pictures of her show clearly this,  you don't get to be her size when you do take care of yourself.    She's dysfunctionally socially because,  unless she's doing this as some sort of inset meta-commentary on people who do suffer from dysfunction,  she assuredly is.   Liking anime and talking to pokemon plushies you've named fred is not usually found within normal social hierarchies.     It is fully expected that many comments will be extremely condescending here.  We cringe at behaviors we find below our level of behavior.   Condescension arises from those who look down on others,  in this case,  for her behaviors and actions in her comics,  the same as you'll find we feel for most cringe worthy behaviors.   It is to be expected and I feel you're in the wrong place here."
4PanelCringe,2vb9zj,PickleSammiches,2,Thu Mar 5 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"Hm, I did lose it a bit at that guy's comment. I just felt it was uncalled for. She may be on meds that make her balloon up? Obviously she gets little exercise...I dunno, it just made me a bit mad for 5 minutes. I'm over it now, which is utterly fickle, I know.  Agree about the social inadequacies, just feel there's more going on. Not really my place to say though, I over reacted. In the grand scheme of things, she's harmless and probably really sweet. I like her plushies.   I knew I was going to get called out for my comment and regretted it, you have been more level headed and thoughtful about the whole thing, I should take notes.   At the very least, I should count to 10 and change tabs for a while before replying. Knee jerk abhorrence does no one any good and makes me look reactionary. Moving on then....."
