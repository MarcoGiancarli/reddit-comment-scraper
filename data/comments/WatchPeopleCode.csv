WatchPeopleCode,3dtwdp,robsoft,3,Sun Jul 19 12:36:35 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure twitch uses flash. You might need to update it.  It has always worked fine for me in Chrome.  However there is a possibility that the dev team has made tweaks that have bugs still.
WatchPeopleCode,3dtwdp,chiproller,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:00 2015 UTC,It switched to HTML5 using WebSockets pretty recently and only uses the flash version as fallback. Might be that the new implementation still got a few problems or might be worth looking into updating his browser if he's running an older one without WebSocket support and it actually turns out to be the reason.

The client is paying me for code, its theirs to decide to release or not. It's probably not the end of the world to disagree on this, but it'd be nice to see what the consensus is."
WatchPeopleCode,3cna2k,hiver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:58:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, went on vacation and just got back.   The majority of what I did was straight HTML/CSS on Sublime Text. Something anyone at anytime has access to simply by going to the site and using developer tools. What little php I did mess with didnt actually work with the database itself and is not something that doesnt already pre-exist in pretty much every wordpress site out there.   As far as what I choose to work on within stream. Every one of my clients know that I stream. I give them the option to opt out of allowing me to stream their site/app. Most of them view it as free advertising.   However I generally follow two steps: 1) If it directly would compromise their site/app or show something proprietary I do not stream.  2)If the site/app is not yet available I develop the application in pieces on separate projects and when the stream is over I move it into the real project. This way the streams only show little pieces of what is being built but not the over-all project itself.  In otherwords most of the time I make things that anyone can make and it gives no clue as to what app/site its for.   As long as you are up front with clients and are careful about what info you show then you can stream anything you'd like. No need to feel guilty about it if you get their consent."

WatchPeopleCode,3ckwc1,jhpy1024,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:50:36 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's great to hear you're excited about diving into a new language/area of research to play around in.  If you are familiar with python, then I'd probably start learning one of the other programming languages you've mentioned. You'll certainly need some variant of C during your degree, or at least need to know the syntax well enough to be using Java and other Object Oriented C-style languages. As for which? Well it's up to you! C is nice in that it can feel far less overwhelming when you're starting to learn it, but it lacks a lot of things you might take for granted in python; like strings, for example.  Machine learning/AI is a HUGE field and you'll have plenty of time to research this broad area while studying for your degree. That said, there's certainly nothing stopping you from learning a language by implementing something that really interests you about the subject. Maybe you want to try and write a spam filter, or a noughts and crosses game with AI. Python is quite good for getting started with this, as the PyGame module makes getting some basic game graphics up very straight forward - there are plenty of tutorials online!  What interests you the most?"

I'm now looking around for some good resources, this looks pretty good, and it's used to teach 1st year CompSci students C#, so it should be at my sort of level. I'll be starting next weekend, streaming on Twitch, and WatchPeopleCode.

WatchPeopleCode,3ant6u,Thornsten,3,Mon Jun 22 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"I'm building an app to facilitate communication between people looking for parking spots and people leaving parking spots in crowded areas. It'll be a .NET stack from front to back. Mostly outside-in TDD but I'm not a zealot about it.  I'll go for at least an hour, maybe 1.5 or 2. My goal is to end up with a series of 25 minute videos documenting the process of building the app from start to finish. I'll record the streams and upload the first one tonight after it's finished, then try to release one per day after that. I'll probably stream twice a week for a few hours at a time. Tonight is mainly to work out the kinks since this is my first time streaming.  E: To set expectations a little, I've been a professional developer since 1999. I was in the public service sector for the first 11 years or so, now I consult. Most of the stuff I build is standard line-of-business software, CRUD with some rules. After 11 years of programming I thought I was pretty awesome. When I joined the private sector I was lucky to be surrounded by people much smarter than me who were able to show me how much I didn't know that I didn't know. I've been working on getting better even since that wake-up call.  I'm no Jon Skeet but I know my way around C# and EF well enough to get the job done.

WatchPeopleCode,3afvby,Pindaman,2,Fri Jun 19 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"hey, yeah it is like that. everything is very simple right now; the client (javascript) basically just takes your input and sends it to the server (c#). Each time the server gets an update from the client, it advances that client forward one timestep and then responds with an update about the current state of the game.  this is somewhat similiar to the quake 1 server model, except even simpler since communication is done over websockets (tcp) instead of udp, and there is no need to worry about lost packets. the client is basically just a dumb terminal with no client side prediction, so you will feel the latency  alot of the game logic for handling the ""physics"" i translated directly from the source of openliero so it has some of the authentic liero feel. collision with the terrain is based off of pixels in a bitmap, which lends itself to display in the html5 canvas as you can easily write pixels to the underlying array.  theres alot i could improve on, but im trying to work on this in a limited timespan with the additional limitation of not using any 3rd party libraries. Im not sure if this aspect makes it more or less interesting for the viewer."

WatchPeopleCode,38gywl,erikb85,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:35:15 2015 UTC,It's not like he's using some kind of magic. This is how you have to figure out most code anyway: using debuggers or print/log statements and playing around with the code until it makes sense.
WatchPeopleCode,38gywl,happy_spanners,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm not familiar enough with Javascript to know if it's obfuscated to make it hard to understand on purpose, or if it's done that way to make everything even more condensed than simply minifying it allowing to save even more characters with everything obfuscated like that.  The game uses over 1 PB per month so I'm guess he wants to save every byte that he can."

I might have it so that it controls external commands or something like that, it'd be nice to give it a definite set.    mksession   Yeah it's really cool actually. When you run mksession it basically saves the session. So say you open vim, open a few files with :e ./file, create a :vsp and that, and then run :mksession, it will save all of the buffers that you had open, and which files you were editing (i think it saves the position as well...). Which is really handy!

Well the creator added a feature for mods/plug-ins and my goal is to make a chat bot plug in. So I can have some sort of a conversation back and forth that's more meaningful than pre scripting every aspect of the ""computer's"" side into the voice attack profile. Because I tried that with a small conversation flow to ""run ship diagnostics"" with a couple of random responses like problem with the shields or weapons or everything's working fine. It was awkward and clumsy and very time consuming. If a real chat bot could be plugged in that would be much better. But I'm not sure how he has that all set up and what sorts of things can be passed back and forth.

WatchPeopleCode,32vlvw,beohoff,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"Hey I wanted to spend some time talking about what I did during this stream, but more importantly the logic of what I did. I think as we program some things become intuitive to us that aren't to the casual beginner, and since it's intuitive it's hard to explain using words.  I had a camera class. Towards the beginning of the stream, I mentioned that the camera class was too ""smart"". What I meant by that was it was responsible for too many things. My camera class at the beginning of this stream was responsible for not only handling the camera feed (whether it be from a webcam or a video file) but also for handling the face detection logic. For what I'm trying to do these are two large pieces of functionality that should not be in the same class. For a smaller project that is scoped narrowly, this would be fine. But because I plan to use this code base to explore the OpenCV libraray, I need all of my classes to be as extensible (which means able to be added to/built upon) as possible.  The problem with having too many large pieces of functionality in the same class is they become intertwined in weird ways that make a lot of sense at the time, but eventually become a chore to add on top of or to swap pieces out. So knowing that the haarcascade method for facial recognition is inherently slow and I'll want to look at different methods for doing the facial recognition, it becomes imperative to isolate the facial recognition logic in it's own class so that I don't have to untangle that logic out of a bloated camera class later down the road.  This doesn't make sense all the time. If you're writing a quick script, or a program that is going to do one thing and one thing only, you're better off not breaking up your program because it's only going to make the logic harder to follow. So keep that in mind!"

Did you upload a full resolution version to YouTube? I see it as 360p, too. But it might get better as time elapses. They don't provide all resolutions immediately as they don't all process in the same amount of time.  That said, cool project. Do you provide commentary on your thought process?

Have you ever wanted to add a status bar to your command line program? Or maybe color the output a bit? Or do you want to write a fullscreen terminal application like ls, top, vim, or emacs? Then you need to speak a bit of terminal! This talk describes how to talk to your terminal from scratch and goes on to show why Python libraries Blessings and Urwid are so awesome.   Abstract   The terminal emulators we run so many of our programming tools in are more powerful than we remember to give them credit for, and the key to that power is understanding the interface. This talk will cover terminal colors and styles, writing to arbitrary portions of the screen, handling signals from the terminal, determining the terminal's dimensions, scrollback buffer behavior and relevant environmental variables.  Terminal programming can get hairy; along the way we'll deal with encoding issues, consider cross platform concerns, acknowledge 4 decades' worth of standards for terminal communication, and consider that humans at interactive terminals may not be the only users of our interfaces. By gaining an understanding of these issues, we'll be able choose from the abstractions over them offered by Python libraries Urwid, curses, and Blessings."

YouTube streams - often have a Git Repo that accompanies the stream, no backing music, generally focussed on the task at hand.   Twitch - Some shit balls EDM track playing through their laptop speakers, far less input into what's actually going on and  the thing vanishes when it's finished   I've noticed that I don't even bother clicking twitch streams most of the time for these reasons. Half the time they've vanished and half the rest are poor.   Not sure if that was a rant or an observation. /obsrant."

I might get sidetracked into working on a DSL for describing terminal state to make the tests prettier.

I am not sure what happened to two other accounts(/u/Henrik-LivecodingTV and /u/mu_livecodingtv),  but there it's very likely that they got banned. Although maybe you simply deleted them.  Also, please don't spam in old threads, this helps no one. I was annoyed when I got like 3 notifications from you in 3 different(old!) threads that I created.  A couple of questions:  1) Why do you put misleading numbers on the ""browse streams"" page(total views instead of current viewers)? It is really confusing and it took me a while to figure that out.  2) Why don't you let streamers download their own videos? Both youtube and twitch allow this(although in case of twitch, with some hassle).  PS: You copied twitch's ToS, but you forgot to change this statement: ""Livecoding.tv allows certain users ("" Broadcaster "") to distribute streaming live and pre-recorded videos of video game related activities."" :) (No, I am not a weirdo that reads ToS.  I was trying to figure if it is possible to download vids, but then I found an entry in FAQ that covered this)."

On forcing login, how are you controlling/filtering that? 1000 people could sign up in a n hour. It adds friction to the process of getting people to watch and interact.
