But I can tell you what I avoid immediately:   summaries that have any sentence starting with ""What if"" ""I suck at summaries"" or the equally annoying ""I promise it's good, just read!"" summaries with spelling/grammatical errors. If you can't even spend the time proofreading your own summary, then you're definitely not going to be proofreading your story. In which case, I'm not going to bother. Same applies with titles. Please capitalize your titles properly. Just please. words/sentences in all caps also this is probably just a weird thing for me, but I usually don't even bother reading summaries for stories with titles that start with ""Harry Potter and the...."" I honestly don't know why. I just feel like that's such a boring and easy way to title a story. There are exceptions to this obviously. For example, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Auror is an excellent fic. But yeah, that's just a personal thing for me.   Overall, I like summaries that give enough info for me to know what to expect, but still leave plenty of room for guessing. So on a spectrum, it should be on the more mysterious end, if that makes sense. Mysterious is always more intriguing for me."

Your summary should entice me to read the story and often if I have to open the link just to see what this is about ... forget it. ""No slash"". Why so many people think they need to point out explicitly ""no slash""? I very often search stories with word ""slash"" filtered out. Like many many others. We missing out on many potentially good stories! List of acronyms about relationships in your story. I saw a summary that had nothing, but long list of every ""romantic"" pair in the story! Quotation from you story. This is a particular pet-peeve of mine. Many summaries simply are a quote that some character supposedly says. Usually cheesy and out of context. I prefer simple description. bad grammar. Try to get at least your summary right. Please!"

He was neither particularly popular amongst his peers, male or female, nor particularly smart or well-read, and, though his prejudice goes as deep as any wizard's ever has, preferred Harry Potter as a victim over Hermione Granger or Ron Weasley, throwing only occasional half-arsed jabs at the two of them.   However, the majority of fanfiction writers will insist that he has gorgeous, flowing silvery platinum locks, eyes as deep and blue as the ocean, and abdominal muscles that can clearly be seen rippling through his semi-transparent shirt. He is, in their eyes, a positive God of sex, having bedded half the women in Hogwarts and then some, and is constantly surrounded by a band of loyal followers that far extends beyond Crabbe and Goyle. His academic prowess is rivaled only by that of his arch nemesis, target of the majority of his bullying, the stunning but bookish beauty Hermione Granger, who will no doubt convince him that muggles aren't so bad with her clever retorts and sizzling curves."

Sure, Harry hated his guts, but it's not like Harry made that much of an effort to get to know Slytherins or people who would view them more neutrally.  Also, while I don't think Draco and Hermione were necessarily academic rivals, it seemed to me that successfully fixing the vanishing cabinet was evidence of some above average intelligence in his part."
HPfanfiction,3e1zh3,someorangegirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"While I can see it potentially happening, Draco pulling a few charming moves and upgrading to better friends, attracting the attention of one or two girls, it very much annoys me when fanfiction states it as though it's such an obvious thing, as though he's always been surrounded by a fawning harem of gorgeous women, and he barely ever associated with Crabbe and Goyle, always opting for the company of cooler, more interesting characters like Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass, when there's no evidence of him even associating with these people in canon.   My belief is that Draco probably wasn't very popular amongst his classmates, Slytherin or otherwise. He was a self-important bully, openly bigoted, loudmouthed, and generally not a nice guy. Even amongst those who did hold with his ideologies of pure-blooded supremacy, they probably didn't want to spend all their time talking about it, or be associated with someone who was so vocal about it. He cheated and bribed his way onto the Quidditch team and then promptly lost most every match, which can't have made him popular amongst Quidditch players or fans. In his first year he lost his house 50 points in one night, which probably didn't win him many points either.   I think Draco had a lot in common with his Aunt, in that he took things way too far, got unnecessarily obsessive, and the people around him, even those who agreed, seldom wanted to deal with the consequences. Unfortunately, Draco seems to lack the strength to back it up, or prefers to run to bigger, badder players for help, so rather than coming off as crazy and fearsome, he's simply annoying and weak.   As for his academic prowess, I'm by no means suggesting that he was stupid. Most likely, he rests a little above average in terms of intelligence. However, Draco comes from a privileged background, and has come to expect everything to be handed to him throughout life. I doubt he would have put much effort into his studies, and probably wouldn't have been above bribing and cheating his way to better grades. Certainly, we never saw him achieve anything spectacular in his schoolwork; despite potions being cited as his best subject, he wasn't part of the Slug Club, and never really excelled at any other subject, just coasted along with good enough grades to get by. Though he showed he was adept at casting advanced, and particularly dark spells when he wished, he seems to simply have not taken enough interest in his school work to really have bothered.   As for the vanishing cabinet, though we can ascertain that it was tricky, we have no idea how advanced the magic used actually was, and it did take him nearly a year. I'd hasten a bet that even Crabbe and Goyle would have somehow found a way to get the Death Eaters into Hogwarts in that time scheme, if Voldemort was breathing down their necks."

Harry is raised at Hogwarts by house-elves and teachers, and though not allowed to get a wand or officially study magic before he turns 11, he does sit in on classes and reads a lot and by the time he does start at Hogwarts he's able to perform some really advanced spells, teaching himself to apparate (illegally) within his first year, and figures a lot of stuff out much faster than he did in the books.

It's not Harry-centric but you said that could be flexible.  Harry is in it, but he has a minimal role as it's a next gen fic.  They're great action/adventure stories that the author has planned out since the first book so everything is interconnected.  They're really very good, though the first book is a bit slow.  However, they get SO GOOD after that.  There are also great original characters in it."

None of them is (should be...) slash, all of them are complete. Have fun.   Harry Potter and the Dark Passenger   When he witnessed the murder of his parents, the darkness got in him. Dumbledore took him in, taught him the best he could, and when it was clear the darkness was in too early, Albus taught Harry how to hide it, and how to get away with killing. AU based heavily on Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. Update: New sections in chapter 5.   Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise   This story chronicles the rise of Harry Potter, the right hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Features a dark Harry in Slytherin, from pre-hogwarts to the end of the war. Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.   The Nightmare Man   In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man… and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.   The Birth of Evil   Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years   Hit the Ground Running   The Horcrux in Harry's head wakes up and begins talking to Harry long before he's ever heard the name Voldemort. Philosopher's Stone AU. Warnings for some instances of child abuse. No pairings. COMPLETE.   To Preserve   Voldemort realises that Harry is a Horcrux as he is escaping from Privet Drive at the beginning of Deathly Hallows. Voldemort captures Harry and is determined for the Horcrux to be in control. However, Harry will not go down without a fight, he is determined to finish the task Dumbledore has given him. Includes Hogwarts. Very dark version of Deathly Hallows.   Too Young to Die   Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.   Somewhere in Time   Sent back in time by a mysterious person and trapped in the past with a missing Dumbledore and an overbearing, charismatic Dark Lord, they had no idea how much they could dabble with before the world they had known shattered into pieces.   Trouble   Harry Potter is a thief and a lawbreaker long before he gets his letter. Upon discovering he's a wizard, he sets out for the wizarding world - but he's doing things his way. Dumbledore has no idea what his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys has wrought. Harry/Multi, darkish, some Dumbledore bashing, rating may go up later.   World in Pieces    AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE.    Delenda Est   Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.   Had I Known   After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash   Finding Home Harry Potter X Avengers   When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.   As Black As Night   The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.   Stages of Hope   Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.   The Other Boy Who Lived   AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.   Renegade Cause   A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks   Boy Who Lived   Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope   The Weapon Revised   After Sirius's death, Harry devotes himself to learning magic in a desperate attempt to protect the people he loves. Warnings: Profanity, Extreme Violence, References to Non-Con -Not of Main Character-, Dark/Questionable Harry   The Other Side of the Coin   Harry Potter, defeater of Grindelwald, has come to Hogwarts. Raised by Sirius Black and sorted in to Slytherin, Harry finds his way under the guidance and watchful gaze of his mentor and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, one Tom Marvolo Riddle.   Path of Decision   Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover COMPLETED!   The Lie I've Lived   Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.   The Substitute The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.  Destiny Reversed   -COMPLETE- One morning Harry wakes up in a different world. His parents are alive and Neville bears the scar. Things are different and Harry starts to like that the weight of the world isn't on his shoulders. Neville may not be able to bear that weight.   Friend or Foe   To what length would Harry go to keep his promise? Harry goes back home and is about to start his fifth year in Hogwarts 'again'. He is confused and doesn't know what to do with Voldemort anymore. Are they friends? Or foes? Sequel to Learn from History   Hogwarts Houses Divided   The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?   What Lies Beneath   COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller   Stronger than Hope   AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE   In Blood Only   Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]   The Darkness Within Death Eater Harry; the only one I know.    [Complete] PostOotP. The Golden Trio sit together laughing, all of them happy at the moment. A blink of an eye and the innocence is lost, destroyed from within by jealousy, distrust and above all a destiny, undeniable in its darkness... Dark!Harry"

Going through 30 stories on mobile just to see tags would take forever. I think that automating the process wasn't a bad idea.  If people don't want the bot to work even if someone else does, they can just use the !ignore tag."

If the OP would've read Saving Connor specifically hoping to read slash, they would've been disappointed because that story doesn't contain any. The two stories following Saving Connor don't contain slash either, and there's no slash yet halfway through the 4th (where I am). It's all pre-slash (working towards a relationship but said relationship hasn't happened yet).

HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,FreakingTea,20,Tue Jul 21 09:33:21 2015 UTC,"More speculations of wizarding culture. There are some odds and ends I really love;   in one fic I read, a girl and her father go to a wizarding dinner theater type thing, and see a show where a woman sings a manticore to sleep. Some dangerous entertainment that seems to fit into the culture. another, Draco, Crabbe & Goyle go camping out in a ""Muggle-hunting"" tent and for the evening's entertainment, make crop circles with their brooms. I found this especially clever, because there's been reports of crop circles IRL in Wiltshire, and that's where Malfoy manor is. That fic had a lot of neat little details like that. In another, it touched on briefly that Pureblood boys thought Mudblood and Halfblood girls are loose, because they wore more provocative clothing in comparison to Pureblood girls. It was set in the late 70s, though.   Expansions on Pureblood culture, I guess, is what's really neat to me. Most of these fics were Slytherin-centric, too."

HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,MagicMistoffelees,8,Sun Jul 19 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yes! I absolutely love world/culture building fics. It's part of why the inheritance trope is a guilty pleasure of mine. While those tend to go more toward government/marriage and such, I've read one where pureblood influence, money, and connections were used by women to help fight from the background in the first war. It was little things like what the wives were expected to be doing or putting their energies toward (which wasn't that).   I've read another (could actually have been the same fic now that I think about it) where a pureblood has no idea how she actually looks while she's walking when wearing Muggle clothes. It wasn't thought about, the idea was grace and poise, walking 'properly' just draws attention to the hips when wearing tight jeans apparently. [Part of me wants to say it was Roundabout Destiny]  One that I know was a different story (I think it featured Draco, I'd have to hunt it down) held the idea that pureblood boys in marriage contracts were sometimes expected to have multiple partners before marriage as 'practice' so to speak so they could properly please their wives. I think their partners would end up being half-bloods since the pureblood girls weren't having any action.  I just love elaborations on both wizarding culture in general but the more isolated 'traditional' culture people assume purebloods have. The entire worldview I guess.

HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,7,Mon Jul 20 02:34:48 2015 UTC,I'm tired of almost all the expansions of pureblood culture being super patriarchal and sexist. Magic is the great equalizer. I would expect there to be much less of a power imbalance between the sexes in magical culture.
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,denarii,4,Mon Jul 20 12:52:14 2015 UTC,"Which is part of why I'm all for more people writing it and expanding on it! The more stories we get that decide to expand on wizarding culture in general, the more we'll get that don't rely on ultrapatriarchy or default sexism.  It's one of the things that makes me wish I could write fiction with any decency. I can do a kick ass essay or rant, but the minute a character is brought into it I can't do it. Everything would be so massively out of character it's awful Lol."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,3,Mon Jul 20 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah. :( I think I'm a decent writer, but my problem is that it's really hard to get myself to sit down and actually devote time to it. I started a fic... almost two years ago I think. I haven't finished the first chapter. I've spent much more time on worldbuilding."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,denarii,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I could take it either way if it's written well. Both ways are plausible to me, since the pureblood families seem mostly entrenched in capitalism."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,FreakingTea,14,Tue Jul 21 09:41:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm all for fics that explore the wizarding world's lore. But I'm not a fan of how some people write about how the British Wizarding World is a decaying pit of human depravity and the pure definition of backwardness... This is usually coupled with how great and progressive the American system of doing things is. I feel that whenever the author's do that there's just a sense of how America is better than Britain coming from the author that is expressed in fiction.   Just as a disclaimer: I don't care if you believe that the US is better than the UK (in HP world or IRL) or not IRL. However I do find it irritating to see people legitimately bashing the hell out of literally everything over here in the UK (fictional and real) whilst continually praising the US' way of doing things and locations (fictional or real). The fics tend to go on to have Harry either moving to the USA or going on and on about how great it is over there. Despite him never having been there previously and whatnot... Yeah. No continuity. I have other things to say about the differences between the US and UK Magical worlds, but now isn't the right forum for it.  Anyway, back on track: I like when people go into HP fics and just expand upon what is canon and effectively make more believable headcanon which attaches onto what was previously established. I also like when people explore things like the pureblood/halfblood/muggleborn/squib relationships and heritages. I find that fascinating and honestly believe it's an area which has loads of potential development."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Cersei_nemo,11,Mon Jul 20 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"This is usually coupled with how great and progressive the American system of doing things is.   Or French or Japanese, if the latter.. expect Harry to start taking out Death Eaters with magical karate."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,denarii,9,Mon Jul 20 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, Japanese wizards don't use wands for their magic! Instead they use handseals which look like they were lifted straight out of Naruto."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Subrosian_Smithy,6,Mon Jul 20 04:59:31 2015 UTC,"I don't mind alternate magic, as long as it's neat. I was reading a Fate/Stay Night Harry Potter crossover where Matou Shinji goes to Hogwarts. Now, the writing isn't always the best, and in recent chapters it's starting to be kind of annoying how many references/crossovers the author is adding, but I really liked that when he added magic from Japan it was Ofuda, something that has roots in history and lore.  As for hand signs, I would totally be ok with them as long as they were more in style with proper Mudra. Including the bodily movements, and dances that tend to go along with it. Also, Mudra tends to be spiritual, so interaction wtih ghosts, divination, and healing would be cool. Also I imagine it taking a little longer. What I don't want to see are people using hand-signs faster then a person can flick a wand, doing everything better through hand-signs, or god forbid, just straight up using jutsus."

HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Karinta,4,Mon Jul 20 08:34:30 2015 UTC,"I may have to read that... I've heard nothing but good things about those fanfics.   I have other things to say about the differences between the US and UK Magical worlds, but now isn't the right forum for it.   I meant this statement, but let's just say that in a fanfic I once wrote, the American system/wizarding world isn't exactly how most people portray it. That's all I'm saying."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Cersei_nemo,3,Mon Jul 20 12:56:41 2015 UTC,"I've heard nothing but good things about those fanfics.   And deservedly so. The first of the series is a bit rocky, but it's not at all bad. The second through fourth are unbelievably good, and the fifth promises to be even better. [That is, when it actually comes out. Hopefully by the end of this year...]"
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Karinta,2,Mon Jul 20 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"I really can't agree more. If magical civilization(s) existed alongside mundane civilizations since the first cultures arose then they have had thousands of years to develop their own society with all the beliefs/morals/traditions that entails. These would likely vary greatly with their mundane counterparts. Particularly given how insular magicals have been shown to be in canon, and the gap between them would almost certainly have widened after they withdrew behind secrecy. Magical and mundane countries would most definitely not line up.  During the 1600s pretty much all of central Europe and northern Italy were part of the Holy Roman Empire (a loose confederation of princedoms, petty kingdoms, free cities, and archbishoprics) under the elected dynasty of the Habsburgs. The Low Countries and southern Italy were controlled by Spain, as was huge swaths of the Americas. Those are just the most blatant examples.  And the magical world being backwards and archaic in laws and equality sort of make sense if you consider their society to be frozen in time in the 1600s. That was two centuries before slavery was first outlawed. Think about that. Women didn't have suffrage. Heck, anyone who wasn't a landowner typically couldn't vote! A society stagnated in such times would be a truly ugly thing.  I've written a few ongoing HP fanfics where I try to be fair to the rest of the world but bring realism to the setting. The history of the magical side of humanity would not be something an egalitarian could endure."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Mortaegus,6,Mon Jul 20 03:43:07 2015 UTC,And the magical world being backwards and archaic in laws and equality sort of make sense if you consider their society to be frozen in time in the 1600s.   Just because they cut off contact with the muggle world doesn't mean their culture suddenly stopped changing. It would just start developing in a different direction.
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,denarii,3,Mon Jul 20 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that it would develop in a different direction, but at a slower rate.   You have to take into account the size difference in population, more people leads to more social interactions, which leads to more conflict, which leads to more resolutions, which leads to changes in the base social structure.  That being said, there would be a constant intake of muggleborns into the society which would help speed up the progression some, but the issue there is that muggleborns are viewed as outsiders."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Ocdar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"That being said, there would be a constant intake of muggleborns into the society which would help speed up the progression some, but the issue there is that muggleborns are viewed as outsiders.   I'd say it really gives context to why Muggleborns are hated in the Wizarding World. The families of said Muggleborns burned a lot of pureblood/halfblood/muggleborns at the stake in the past... The ones who started the hate would have valid reasons to mistrust them and view them as outsiders. But their descendants would misinterpret the reasons why they did such things or mix the messages of the past, with it eventually becoming this notion of pureblood supremacy over anything less than what came before.  Hell that probably is what happened."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Cersei_nemo,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"I'm all for AUs where magical and non-magical territories don't exactly match up (British MoM governs Ireland in canon IIRC), but overall canon seems to paint another picture. A few centuries back, Bulgaria was under Ottoman rule, most of the Indian subcontinent was governed by the Mughal Empire and what is now Burkina Faso was a collection of Mossi city-states. Despite geo-political change not really meaning much to wizards (as far as we know), all of those countries now have their own Ministries of Magic. I'm not too fond of that to be honest, but it's canon.  As for suffrage, Elfrida Clagg was Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council in the seventeenth century, with Artemisia Lufkin following in her footsteps as Minister a century later. Throw in the Chocolate Frog Card of a black Mungo Bonham and I think we can safely assume that the Eurocentric kyriarchy was a mostly Muggle phenomenon."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Ihateseatbelts,4,Mon Jul 20 10:27:48 2015 UTC,"It makes a certain sense if you assume that there is a Ministry for Magic in every muggle government purely to keep their eye on magical interference in muggle affairs. Any time a new government forms, a rep from the ICW who is familiar with the area is sent to infiltrate, investigate and sign off on the government's purity of muggle purpose. There is probably a collected Ministries of Magic office for all of Central Africa, another for Asia Minor, and the Carribbean one is designated only by which of the 15 local government reps is most sober when the 'Ministry' is approached with a concern. The Polynesian Minister is effectively the Minister for Magic in 30 separate but generally cooperative governments spanning the South Pacific. She goes by many names, but everyone knows that her appearing in your office is not a good sign."

As a Londoner of West Indian extraction, I take exception to this one - we Antilleans are notorious for being able to hold our liquor to the surprise of Slavs and Celts alike.  Ican'tspeakforTrinis,though..."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Ihateseatbelts,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:21 2015 UTC,^ This. So much this.    I've written a few ongoing HP fanfics where I try to be fair to the rest of the world but bring realism to the setting.    I'd love to read your fanfics if you've done that. :)
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Cersei_nemo,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:28 2015 UTC,"During the 1600s pretty much all of central Europe and northern Italy were part of the Holy Roman Empire   This comment leads into the thing that I wish was expanded upon, non roman based societies of magic.  It makes entirely too much sense think that the animagus transformation was derived from the Native American wizarding culture. If there is one thing that the general population thinks about when they hear Native Americans, it's spirit animals and guides.  I can see occlumency and legilimency having been born in India, or from another culture where self discipline came in the form of meditation.  I imagine the prevalence of the Abrahamic religion in the middle east would have prevented any magical society from rising up and differentiating itself there.  Also what kind of magic would china have wielded, especially during the warring states era? The immediate thought is definitely Chinese martial arts, probably not DBZ style energy blasts, but definitely some sort of hit that would disrupt the energy flow enough to cause anything from pain all the way up to death."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Ocdar,12,Mon Jul 20 18:11:56 2015 UTC,I'd like to see switched at birth in a story. Harry winds up with some random muggle couple and their baby winds up with James and Lily.
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,KeriRussellBrand,6,Sun Jul 19 14:48:25 2015 UTC,so no Voldemort?
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,psi567,9,Sun Jul 19 19:39:32 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. The baby born to them is the prophesized one, not necessarily whatever child is being raised by James and Lily. The requirements are being born at the end of July to parents who defied Voldemort three times.   Since Voldemort had decided to target the Potters, and the child there doesn't fulfill the prophecy, the entire family would perish, and Voldemort would be fine. But if he chose to then target the Longbottoms just in case, it would turn Nevile into the Boy Who Lived. Possibly.  Or, say Voldemort becomes top dog because neither child vanquished him. By targeting the Potters, he marked Harry as an equal. Mark doesn't have to mean physical mark. So plot!Harry being in the right place at the right time, having been born to two powerful people and powerful in his own right (corporeal patronus at 13?!), saves the world. Or something. Someone would realize something fishy was up, and cue the inheritance trope."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,8,Sun Jul 19 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"I think the prophecy would work regardless of the child chosen by Voldemort. IIRC Dumbledore said that prophecies only have the power that people choose to give  them or something like that, so in this case Lily's love would still protect to baby and make the killing curse rebound on Voldemort."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Guizkane,6,Sun Jul 19 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"But there's a qualifier in it: ""born to those who have thrice defied him."" The swapped baby was not born to parents that defied him three times- it was born to Muggles. Voldemort is enough of a psycho to decide to kill Neville's family as a precautionary measure. Because by him deciding to target any child, he's giving power to the prophecy, and thus triggering it.   It would be interesting to see what Lily's sacrificial magic may have done while protecting a child that doesn't belong to the prophecy, but I do think the prophecy comes down to Harry or Neville. There'd have to be some fanfic magic worked in where the baby's Muggle parents survived three different attacks (bombings? fires? something?) that were ordered by or done by Voldemort, which would then fulfil that qualifier."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,6,Sun Jul 19 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"What I meant is that in this particular case, with Voldemort not knowing that the baby is a muggle, the prophecy would still trigger because Voldemort himself is the one who gives power to it and it just acts as a guide to the actions of the people it concerns."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Guizkane,5,Sun Jul 19 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"So it might end up with RandomBaby as The-Boy-Who-Lived, while Harry is still the ""chosen one""."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Slindish,4,Mon Jul 20 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"So many ways it could play out!  Oh and since the baby was from a random Muggle couple, if we assume the baby is a Muggle and not a convenient Muggleborn, if the baby somehow fulfills the prophecy, the wizarding world would have to credit a Muggle with the ending of their war and vanquishing of Voldemort (though they'd think it was a squib?). How would he do it? A gun? It's not like he'd get a Hogwarts letter."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,4,Mon Jul 20 01:18:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lily's sacrificial magic depended on the prophecy. It's still a mother dying in place of her child either way. So she sacrifices herself, baby lives, curse rebounds on Voldemort and the world calls this the BWL. A bit like a false prophecy, where everyone believes this is the saviour, while really it's Harry and he's later marked in a different way.   I think it's the blood protection that gets iffy because Harry was protected through his mother's blood, but a wrong!child wouldn't be a blood relative of Lily or Petunia so it might not last.  So maybe the wrong child  grew up with the Dursleys because Dumbledore thought the blood protection would keep him safe. It never comes into play the next ten years because the free DEs either don't care for finding their Lord or don't know how to navigate the muggle world. The wrong child shows up at Hogwarts, and the Philosopher's Stone happens and the kid dies at the end because Lily's protection never lasted or was renewed or whatever the reasoning behind the Dursleys were."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,chatterchick,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:29 2015 UTC,"Expanding on this, how does the Hogwarts letters work? Maybe the real Harry Potter receives a letter, returns the letter because it is the wrong name. Eventually Hogwarts gets it straightened out, realizes that there was a switch and now has the prophisized boy, and the muggle boy who lived?  Further the muggle boy was marked as Voldemorts equal, yet his parents did not defy him thrice. So the story could be a drama about Dumbledore not knowing who now fits the prophecy, Muggle Boy, Real Harry Potter, or Neville Longbottom."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Evilsbane,3,Mon Jul 20 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Look at us all, practically writing a collaborative fic lol  If Harry received a letter while living in a Muggle household, with no knowledge of magic, he'd probably be one very confused child. I say confused instead of excited because it's likely he had a normal childhood and doesn't need an escape. Without a proper response, a staff member would probably be sent to the Dursleys for Muggle!Harry, at which point they'll probably realize the problem. Maybe.   There's gotta be some kind of magical blood test to make sure someone is who they think they are, test relations and such. Then they have to find out where the real ""Harry Potter"" is, if he's even still in the country."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,3,Mon Jul 20 19:49:16 2015 UTC,"It would also be nice if ""Harry WrongMother"" wasn't a super wizard, just an average student, perhaps skilled in..... Divination? Like the scrying stuff not seeing the future. But the point is, give him something that he excels at that Voldemort wasn't big into, but besides that make him normal. You would have Herbology Neville, RandomThing Harry, and Science Boy who lived."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,Evilsbane,3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"Yes! Heck, he grew up in a muggle home going to Muggle schools, so he probably learned proper math up until Hogwarts, and actually being allowed to do well without being bullied. Stick him in arithmancy! It's something we don't see often without it going the super!Harry route (or at least I haven't seen it much). We rarely even see it mentioned in canon. So then you've got muggle science, herbology, and wizard math."
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,girlikecupcake,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that Voldemort's AK would rebound and destroy him, as per canon, but the ""adopted"" Harry would die as well.  The ""Survive against Voldemort's AK"" Power He Knows Not wouldn't be in the adopted child.  Unless it was! Dun dun dunnnnn.... a muggle as the Prophecied Child??"
HPfanfiction,3dtwjn,bloopenstein,2,Tue Jul 21 02:09:39 2015 UTC,"Such a scandal! But if nobody figured out they were switched, they'd assume he was a squib, which is still such a taboo from what we see!"

I can imagine British magical society determining that such a thing was possible, but the person in such a situation can't perform magic, so it's useless as a means of staying alive.

Her fluff is never saccharine and doesn't ignore tough topics as they come up, like the war, and the story feel substantial even though they're just about the everyday. As long as the story isn't marked with dark/horror, it'll likely fit your criteria (her angst stories are fairly light).   Amaranthine and Some Kind of Beauty are stories I rec here often, the former is a James/Lily and the latter is an ensemble next gen Weasley family short story. Hunter's Moon is her new Marauders era that I literally just read, and it's silly and wonderful. The Enemy of My Enemy is a riff on the female Marauders trope, which is my next to-read. She writes all genres and eras, so you'll probably find something to your taste.

HPfanfiction,3dtfkp,FanfictionBot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:44 2015 UTC,Dearly Beloved was so sweet I think it gave me diabetes. But it was worth it.
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,AntichthonLives,9,Sat Jul 18 20:58:09 2015 UTC,Well there is another reason purebloods don't like muggleborns! Because purebloods have paid the taxes that cover the muggleborns education. Not only do they come in without knowing the culture but the proper magicals foot the bill for their schooling.   I guess this sort of explains why we don't hear about any British competitors to Hogwarts. There is no need for a cheaper option.   Author revelations like this seem trite in the age of Twitter. Before the interwebs an author would have to write a new book to do something like this. Now they can Tweet from the toilet (I mean WC) and you've got some fresh canon.
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,CalcasieuRed,6,Sun Jul 19 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"This will certainly be interesting. Makes Harry a bit wealthier when the series ended, disregarding whatever he may have been given or earned at that point, since he wasn't paying tuition. Also makes me wonder just how little Arthur was making, for them to be that poor while only having to take care of multiple children three months of the year.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this gets implemented or taken into account. And it does explain why the ministry seemed to have the ability to appoint Umbridge. Maybe the Board is an intermediary between the ministry and the school. Ministry appoints or approves of the board, board oversees the school, ministry can go over the board's authority."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,girlikecupcake,15,Sat Jul 18 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"She said the tuition was free. She did not say the school supplies were free. Sending kids to school is not cheap. They would need trunks, wands, robes, quills, parchment etc. The cost would add up if you had to send seven kids to school.  That's not including extras like pets and brooms."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,nounusednames,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it would be as expensive as people make out. I know how expensive it was to put myself and my brothers through school- there were 5 kids in my family on one income low enough to keep us on free/reduced lunch, and I was the one going to the store with my mom for both groceries and school supplies.  Let's massively lowball and say that it was $400/mo to feed my family of seven people ($58/person/mo). That's $4800/yr just on food. Increase that to 9 people and you have $6200/yr. For every child that they send to Hogwarts for nine months of the year it frees up $500 (or leaving home completely, $700). I can see them being extremely poor before Bill goes to Hogwarts, and that first year being difficult, but after that point they should be saving enough money from food alone to easily afford school supplies. After Bill's first year, they're saving at least $500/year. And we found out in HBP that Hogwarts has a means of helping the poor or otherwise monetarily hindered afford supplies, which the Weasleys may have used those first few years.   Yeah it's expensive, I came up with an average of $200/year for 7 years, unevenly spread, per child for school expenses. Assuming every child got a broom and pet. Not including clothing that would be provided regardless of school status. But that's still less than the family would have been paying just to feed the kid the nine months they're gone. And that to me indicates that they shouldn't have been as poor as was implied in Chamber of Secrets, unless Arthur made a ridiculously low amount of money for being head of a department."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,girlikecupcake,3,Sun Jul 19 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that uniforms add a significant cost. I went private and we had a number of students who were on scholarships. My first uniform kit (in 1995) cost my parents almost $1000. There was a second hand shop but they'd have your size if you were lucky. And then there's the bag, the sports uniform the winter uniform and so on. My friend who was scholarship had one item of each clothing. It was cheaper to wash them every night (and then only if needed. I remember her crying if she spilt something on her clothes) then to buy another brand new one. Every year we'd go to the shop when it opened every week until they got her size or the next two sizes up."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,Lozzif,3,Sun Jul 19 07:28:39 2015 UTC,"They have to buy parchment and stuff, though, and that shit is expensive. They aren't buying plastic pens and mass-produced paper, they're buying quills and ink and parchment. Then you need to get them cauldrons, which are expensive, and if they join Quidditch they'll need brooms... What if Molly and Arthur were saving money to pay for Ginny's wedding?  Children are pretty expensive, especially when there are 7 of them."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,haloraptor,5,Mon Jul 20 09:19:44 2015 UTC,"I dont think the Weasleys are POOR. Remember they helped throw Bill and Fluer's wedding. I would say that compared to the Malfoys, the Weasleys are poor. We only really hear rich people calling the Weasley's poor, and we only see into their vault the one time. For all we know that was just Arthur's account. I am certain that Charlie and Bill send money to their parents when needed, same with Percy after they make up."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,Zerokun11,6,Sat Jul 18 22:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's likely that they're only comparatively poor, instead of actually in poverty. It's still something I'm rather curious about, since they're described as being poor (though only by those with money) and getting things secondhand (Ron didn't even have his own wand or robes)."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,girlikecupcake,0,Sat Jul 18 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I was surprised now that I think about it on how expensive Ollivander's is. 7 galleons for a wand. wow...

HPfanfiction,3drsh6,Riversz,2,Sun Jul 19 09:56:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe wands are subsidized? Or maybe they are pretty cheap to make but the process is proprietary. At $50 a wand it does seem like a tough business model to make successful if wizards use the same wand for most of their life. I don't know, it feels like there is not enough information to determine anything definite."

HPfanfiction,3drsh6,Slindish,3,Sun Jul 19 11:38:27 2015 UTC,This is completely unsurprising; the only way Hogwarts having tuition would work is if there were also state schools for people to send their children to. Having your one and only school be private doesn't really make sense.
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,Emmarrrrr,3,Sun Jul 19 06:38:16 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the tuition idea with he public schools being the cost-free alternative for the majority.  I mean, just looking at the amount of students, one would think ""That can't be all of them"". There have to be more children out there, or else the whole wizard society of Britain would have about the size of a medium village.  Are there some official numbers? How many wizards and witches are the in HP's Britain?"
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,UndeadBBQ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:24:49 2015 UTC,"She wasn't very good with any of the numbers, but there are meant to be anywhere between 1000 and 30000 wizards in Britain. It's difficult to tell because certain things suggest \ smaller population (e.g. the number of children at Hogwarts) but others suggest a larger population.  Rowling said once that she sees Hogwarts as a school with ~1000 students, which would imply a population somewhere in the range of 3000+. BUT we don't have any official figures really because lots of things are contradictory.  FWIW Hogwarts being free makes more sense than it being fee-paying, at least from my perspective. The majority of schools in the UK are free to attend, and the wizarding population is very small, and I think it's mandatory that children go to Hogwarts. It's a small population and every magical child has to attend."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,haloraptor,3,Mon Jul 20 09:25:30 2015 UTC,Rowling was never very good with numbers anyways. I'd take it all with a grain of salt.
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,tusing,8,Sun Jul 19 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"This makes no sense to me. If the Ministry covered the costs of operating Hogwarts I would expect them to be much more involved in the running of the school, not just when Umbridge shows up as the Villain of the Year."
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,denarii,10,Sat Jul 18 21:05:12 2015 UTC,I think there is a Ministry-run Board of Education mentioned in Prisoner of Askaban.
HPfanfiction,3drsh6,girlikecupcake,8,Sat Jul 18 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking they do but via the board of governors. Idk how things are done in the UK, but I know the US federal reserve has a board of governors, who are appointed by the President & Senate. So if it's similar, the board oversees the school, the ministry only steps in when they feel like getting their hands dirty, by going over the board. We know how Fudge was- content to sit by and assume or pretend everything was fine."

Hogwarts being free doesn't surprise me at all because er, she did set this in Britain after all and there's a very British feel to the whole thing and Hogwarts was literally the only wizard school.  That would be like having only fee-paying Welsh language schools in Wales."

HPfanfiction,3dsfqe,ClaraBlack,10,Sun Jul 19 00:35:58 2015 UTC,"While what you're saying makes sense to me, perhaps you are underestimating the physical side of becoming infatuated with someone.  Oftentimes crushes don't make sense, and I'm pretty sure Dumbledore's was one of those, given that they only knew each other for a couple of months, and Rowling has even said that Grindlewald didn't really return Dumbledore's affections.    I think you're right that most people writing are trying to explain how it happened and anything as slow-burning as you'd like to read would definitely be more AU."
HPfanfiction,3dsfqe,cavelioness,5,Sun Jul 19 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a lot of writers go with ""Albus is Light, Gellert is Dark"" - as if Light/Dark are actual character traits like smart or funny, and not labels. Gellert did evil things, and felt that wizards deserved to rule over muggles (and he should rule over wizards). That's not the same thing as ""being dark"". Albus also thought that wizards deserved to rule over muggles and he should rule over wizards- he was just less comfortable with the violence that would be involved in setting up such a system, and after getting a taste of that violence first-hand when his sister died, decided that the violence was wrong, not just a necessary evil, and that if the violence was wrong maybe the idea that wizards should rule over muggles was wrong too. He doesn't seem to have been as bothered with the idea of strong wizards ruling over the rest, though he did feel that he was a bad choice. Making those decisions didn't make him ""light"".  Albus/Gellert works just fine when they want the same things and avoid really talking/thinking about the bits that make Albus uncomfortable with their plans. And it's really easy for 17/18 year-olds (the summer after Hogwarts) to ignore things that they don't want to think about as long as they're not shoved in their face- especially when they're in love."
HPfanfiction,3dsfqe,PresN,4,Tue Jul 21 01:21:53 2015 UTC,"We don't know if Albus was always light. The way he acts - it is very likely he agreed with Gellert and Gellert's goals until the death of Ariana, when everything changed."

HPfanfiction,3ds0it,albeva,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:17:35 2015 UTC,"I think it would work. The whole concept would not be that Harry is rejecting the fact that Sirius is dead. He would want the PAIN to stop. Sirius is the first death that Harry faces, and in my mind, that is his most intense moment. And while I agree that he needs to be able to eventually work through it, my Harry would hate that people feel pain. He would attempt to numb himself, and others in his quest to feel less hollow inside. That would be where he fell into darkness. Harry never really felt love, and when he did he had it ripped from him by a psycho bitch. (sorry Bella) So I want a harry that would react as if he lost the one thing he always wanted, followed by being told that his whole existence is simply to kill a man who wants him dead."

I think part of this is ragehate on the part of the H/Hr shippers, part of it is disappointment in Harry's systemic underachievement throughout canon, with Ron being a convenient scapegoat.   I ship H/Hr but I don't hate on Ron and in fact it's something that constantly gets on my nerves when I read it in practically any fic, regardless of who's shipped with who. It's all over the top bashing of his flaws that he displays early on, the things that he eventually gets over.   But yeah, it's literally at the point now that the only bashing of Ron I'll accept is when Harry is sorted into Slytherin. Because that is acceptable bashing. It's canon effectively, given that Ron has a natural bias against all Slytherins regardless of who they are and what they do. So it's natural that his target would respond in kind. Honestly that bias is probably just a problem with his upbringing, but it's something that's tolerable if not understandable if we put ourselves in his shoes.  Any other bashing of him or outside of that context will literally make me put down the fic and read something else. H/Hr fics are nice usually, but the level of Ron bashing in some of them is ridiculous. Not to mention it usually downgrades into ""let's bash the whole Weasley family, the only people who treat Harry like true family and say Harry and Hermione's love lives were actually manipulated by Molly Weasley, Ginny Weasley and Albus Dumbledore for whatever reason we choose to invent by use of love potions."" Honestly, that gets dull and repetitive real fast.  Tbh I agree in part with the user howtopleaseme on this. It would be easier if the trio didn't date each other, perhaps it would even be preferable. Which is why I guess in non BWL stories like Kwan Li's the Other Boy Who Lived, Harry is not even in the trio and is therefore ""eligible"" to date Hermione without competition or hatred from Ron."

It doesn't help that they're all more or less the same story of Dumbledore's manipulation, secret vaults, Ron's bad influence, love potions, etc. etc.  Needless to say, a good portrayal of  H and Hr without any of those things is something of a rare treat for me.

If only I could pay Ella to finish her stories (This one, but specifically Yellow Submarine and Socks), I would do it in a heartbeat.      Also, Harry/Ginny stories in general rarely bash the rest of the Weasleys and Ron is generally an important character, though almost all of them pair Ron with Hermione, so YMMV. Try linkffn(After the End), which has the best Ron characterization ever, linkffn(The Black Library) and Linkffn(Phantom Limb) for other good Ron characterizations.       Also, Syn's Wake the Dead has a very heroic Ron. Plus, the whole story is basically an zombie invasion of Hogwarts, which is awesome.  Not very fond of Jbern's Number Games. Ron doesn't feel very Ron-ish (All of Jbern's protagonists are pretty much the same regardless of which story), and I don't have much reason to read a Ron story if Ron isn't characterized right."

HPfanfiction,3dm9rx,FanfictionBot,2,Fri Jul 17 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"linkffn(The Price of Love by RogueSugah)  I'll make this recommendation with a few caveats, which I'll get out of the way right quick.   Firstly, the simple AGE of this fanfic (2004-2006) means you're likely to encounter multiple tropes that have simply fallen out of fashion in the years since. This also means, of course, that the fic is post-OotP at the most.  Secondly, you have to be able to live with the author's form of dialogue, which can be a bit shouty even when it's just internal dialogue. For me, it works though, because it seems consistent with Ron's character and age to be a bit internally confused and constantly changing his mind/arguing with himself.  If you can get past that, plus other issues I'm sure I don't remember thanks to my rose tinted glasses of remembrance, this is one of the few longer stories I've read where Ron's good intentions are honored and recognized, despite his faults."

Considering your website also just makes a mention and doesn't go in further detail, I'm suspicious you're just using them as buzzwords to attract your target audience."
HPfanfiction,3dld9c,Makinporing,0,Fri Jul 17 11:27:28 2015 UTC,"Nope, but I respect your suspicions. I wrote that copy and it is aimed more toward writers than readers.

Not intended as a radical or buzzy message, but I admit it means little until we prove we mean it!"
HPfanfiction,3dld9c,Makinporing,3,Fri Jul 17 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"I want you to clarify something, how exactly will your company get a good reputation if you're admitting you're not really looking for what's best? How will people feel when you contact them, and then find out that they were picked for their race/sexuality instead of the quality of their writing?  It's funny because you're acting like the publishing industry is prejudiced against fanfiction writers, when we have The Mortal Instruments and Thirty Shades of Grey being best-sellers, and J.K. Rowling (which according to your definition is ""diverse"" for being a working class woman, somehow) being one of the richest writers in the world.   As I said, it does look like you're just using buzzwords to capture the attention of clueless fanfiction writers for some dastardly reason. I don't think people will fall for it."
HPfanfiction,3dld9c,SteelbadgerMk2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've gotten this response, and I'll be thinking about it. But we are not ""picking"" any manuscripts based on anything other than quality. We don't do memoirs, so there's no real benefit to us contracting a manuscript based on the author's identity.   The bottom line is that we hope to see a diverse array of submissions from a diverse array of authors. Don't see anything wrong with that. Although FWIW, those aren't exactly the kinds of company values known for making dollar signs appear in the eyes of investors, so let's not get the motives twisted here.  I get that you're not buying it, though. That's cool. I will say that I don't think fanfiction writers are clueless, and I don't really expect them to fall for anything. Again, nothing we say means anything until we prove it, so only time will tell."
HPfanfiction,3dld9c,someorangegirl,2,Sat Jul 18 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting idea and after reading over the sister post on /r/Fanfiction I can see the value that you might add for the authors (over and above simply choosing to self-publish).  Of course it means little to me, I don't have any significant original works and my fanfiction is very closely tied to the fandom worlds to the point where attempting to decouple it would be both futile and damaging to the story in question. That said, one thing I see a lot of while perusing the various fanfiction sites is people looking to get into writing original fiction that they can actually publish. It in no way surprises me that you have been receiving a lot of manuscripts, after 50 Shades there has been a very real interest in making the jump and if this gains traction in the larger fanfiction communities I can see you getting swamped.  I wonder how discerning you are intending to be. Your site says you do not discriminate between the various genres of fanfiction, and that is to the good, but just how good do you think a story has to be to see any real success in the dog-eat-dog world of real publishing? It seems to me that in many ways quality isn't all that important, in truth. Instead it's about some kind of x-factor, or simply momentum. 50 Shades did well because the fanfiction community gave it the kick-start needed to gain visibility among the thousands of books published each week. Will you be reliant on that same mechanism for the works you publish, or do you have other plans on how to promote the stories you end up publishing?  Basically, are you going to be aiming for quantity or quality? Are you going to publish all the books that reach certain standards and simply hope that one or two make it big or are you going to focus effort on a few stories that you think are exceptional?"
HPfanfiction,3dld9c,someorangegirl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:07:24 2015 UTC,"So, this is basically about me, because I'm the sole captain of acquisitions. And here's the thing: I am a writer first, and a reader. I am not a publishing executive. The entire reason this press came about was because I had a great relationship with a publisher I work with, and we had a lot of conversations over drinks about my self-published fiction, my thoughts on things like 50 Shades, and my obsession with the world of fanfiction.   I had never once considered starting an imprint until my publisher started bouncing the idea around. I was just someone who had read some fucking mindblowing fanfiction and couldn't shut up about it.   So my point is, I want to publish that mindblowing fanfiction. I don't know if it will make lots of money or not. I certainly have to hope so. But ultimately it just drives me insane to compare my favorite fanfics to the manuscripts I've seen behind the scenes while working as a freelance writer and editor.   I mean so much fanfiction is just so fucking good. And I love fannish communities and all the different subcultures, and I would just be thrilled to see all this talent and uniqueness kind of break into publishing and claim a space.   With all that said, we do have to also consider quantity at the beginning. Not only because we're brand new and I have a quota to meet, but because we're not yet getting nearly swamped enough by submissions. The more submissions I get the pickier I hope to be.   I like cult hits and niche stuff. I know good, weird books can succeed. Maybe not on the 50 Shades scale, but enough to be worth publishing. I would much rather focus on exceptional stories than throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. That's been something I've stressed throughout the development of this idea, so we'll see how much I get yelled at for it in time, haha."
HPfanfiction,3dld9c,Imakemyownjam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"The other post is really informative! It'd be great to have that information more readily available somewhere on your site. I don't have a manuscript yet, but your imprint's mission is exciting and I hope your first releases do well. I've planned to convert one of my fics--but in a total rewrite, almost as if I'm writing an AU of it, keeping only the character shells and beats. Fic's been a great outlet to go nuts with story lines; it's a very first draft-y process for me.   Some general questions: When querying and submitting to presses, those that don't look for fic authors specifically, is there a particular way we should sell these manuscripts? Especially if the fic is popular with a sizable readership (and what would they find sizable?). What about a social media presence? I've gotten really lucky with building an audience and I wonder if it's anything that can give an edge in proving my story has a market.   I've heard these converted-fic stories are a hot new thing, but it still feels like there's a stigma attached to them. What's the general feeling in the industry right now? Also, all of the ones I've heard of seem to be Twilight/50 Shades-esque. Are they just scouting for that type specifically? In any case, I'm glad your imprint is looking specifically for offbeat titles. Fandom excels most at telling stories outside of the mainstream.  Also interested in how you plan to market these stories, but Steelbadger asked it better."

HPfanfiction,3djmhr,FanfictionBot,12,Fri Jul 17 00:02:41 2015 UTC,"I don't read a lot of fanfiction, but I really enjoyed this Snape centered one: A Difference in the Family. It is written with Snape as a point-of-view character, starting with his birth and ending with his death. I though it was fascinating and well written. I also think that Snape, as he is presented in the story, aligns closely with Snape in the books. He's a more sympathetic, but only you see first hand his life and how he is influenced to make the decisions that he does. Well worth a read, imo!"

HPfanfiction,3dizkp,Phantom_Peacock,4,Thu Jul 16 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"Here is my personal rule. If the story has not been updated in 12 months, its abandoned. The only exceptions are if their profile is updated with info. Do some research on their profile, and generally, if its 12 months with nothing, its probably abandoned, sadly. this only really applies to Harry Potter Fanfiction. Anime/manga fanfictions are normally abandoned after 9 months, movie fanfictions are normally abandoned after 6 months, and all else is 4 months. Keep in mind these are MY personal rules. I do not pretend to speak for others."
HPfanfiction,3dizkp,Zerokun11,8,Fri Jul 17 04:45:38 2015 UTC,Every time this question comes up (Is X Abandoned?) odds are that we have the exact information you do: When was the last post; has the author said in their profile or in the chapter that they are abandoning it or just busy; when was the last time they edited their profile or fav'd a story (showing activity). You can look those up for any author and make your own guess as to whether the author quit or is just busy.

But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of ’92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he’d thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet  -A while back, I wondered what might have happened if, instead of being stuck with a child whom he viewed primarily as James Potter's, Snape had to protect a child he considered predominately to be Lily's.  -I also wanted to augment and explore Harry's extraordinary capacity for love, an aspect of the series which intrigued me and which I'd have liked to seen more of.-I have rated this fic as ""Mature"" both to account for future chapters that have not yet been written, and because this pairing, particularly in the context of this fic, where Harriet and Snape know each other from her first year, is one that many people may find hard to accept. My rating is meant in respect of that distinction.-Cheat Sheet: If you want CoS, start with Ch 1. If you want PoA, start with Ch 15. If you want GoF, start with Ch 49. GoF is still ongoing. -Finally, sometimes I quote from canon, but I don't have it marked because that always really jars my reading experience. Considering that this is fanfic, I'm sure you're used to assuming that anything you recognize belongs to JK Rowling, who deserves all the credit. We wouldn't be here without her.    Life As She Knows It by Meg_NeverMore   Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not  when  she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]  This DOES NOT reflect my actual attitude towards God. I believe in Him, and I know He loves us - I just don't think that Hollis would think so. As far as I know, Harry was never exposed to church or to God, and I think the lack of knowledge in addition to what he had been through would've made him less inclined to think well of Him.    Gravity by SlytherinsQuill   What if Harry Potter was born a girl and known as Rosalie Potter? How might it change the dynamics of life as the most famous teenager in the Wizarding World? At the end of Rosalie Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, war has broken out in the Wizarding World as a result the attack on Hogwarts. Forced to spend the summer at Grimmauld Place for her own safety, Rosalie learns more about herself and the people around her than she ever thought possible. Relationships form, friendships change and she learns just how much the people in your life influence who you are and who you have the potential to become.  A/N: Hi all! This is my first HP-verse fanfiction! This is a repost from other sites as I have posted elsewhere. It's a WIP currently that I am just returning to after an enforced break due to real life dramas, but I am back writing again now which is very exciting. I hope you all enjoy it. Just something for you to consider while reading, while I've read over this for spelling and grammar, etc myself, I currently don't have a beta reader, so I apologise if I've missed anything.In this story Harry was born a girl. He will stay a girl throughout, but most of what happened in all the books up the end of the sixth book stay true to the plot. I'm not going to give you a background to the plot because you should be able to pick most of it up from the story line.Please let me know what you think :)~Quill ********************************************************* Disclaimer: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by JK Rowling, various publishers including but not limited to Bloomsbury Books, Scholastic Books and Raincoat Books, and Warner Bros., Inc.

HPfanfiction,3dg7r9,FanfictionBot,3,Thu Jul 16 12:41:59 2015 UTC,"The only Fem!Harry I have read is A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh (enjoyed it).   I am wondering about Fem!Harry/Snape stories. How do writers get around the squicky feeling that Snape (unintentionally or not) pairs with H to recreate what was lost with Lily?   Canon Snape is the prototypical ""stuck-in-the-past"" guy. So it seems a bit odd that when he does get in his first mutual relationship he overcomes the social hurdles of a 20+ age difference, a student/teacher history and pairing with the kid of his childhood friend and unrequited love? Each one of those factors is not impossible to overcome (it happens in real life for sure) but to overcome ALL of them? If it is a time-travel fic then at least the age issue is resolved. It seems like unless their was a strong incentive, why choose H over choosing someone more compatible  or just continuing the single life? What draws him out? If Snape starts with canon characterization, the simple fact of Harry having different bits this time doesn't seem like enough to fundamentally change Snape.   So, I am genuinely curious, how do writers get around this issue? What plots devices and character developments are usually used? Are they compelling enough? Or is the issue not addressed? Should it be?   Thanks!"
HPfanfiction,3dg7r9,CalcasieuRed,3,Thu Jul 16 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"As a Snarry fan, the fact of the matter is the best Snape/Harry does not really have canon characterization of Snape. Canon Snape is a creep. Fanon Snape is a tortured, deep hero. Canon Snape is obsessively fixated on a girl who he hadn't talked to since he was 16, and who died when he was about 20, and it has become so twisted inside him that he becomes something almost like Gollum, fixated on the precious.  Fanon Snape discovers that what he felt for Lily was a pale imitation of love, compared to the true parternship and respect and connection he feels for Harry (or fem!Harry as the case may be). Usually he comes to understand that Harry's life sucked and Harry has dealt with hardship, just like Snape, while Lily was beloved by her parents and lived a charmed life (until her untimely death). This understanding that Harry brings helps Snape realize that what he felt for Lily was a crush, an infatuation, not true love. Canon Snape could never get to that point, because he was too obsessed with his own pain to see anyone else's."
HPfanfiction,3dg7r9,practical_cat,4,Thu Jul 16 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"So you see, there's this useful little tool in language known as paragraphs..."
HPfanfiction,3dg7r9,tusing,4,Thu Jul 16 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know what those other guys are complaining about at all. There is nothing wrong with a good sized paragraph and they shouldn't be grammar shaming. They're not obese, bloated, and wordy, they're beautiful, big structured, and heavily detailed. I can't belive they have never heard of health at every structure. All paragraphs are equal in usefulness no matter their size or shape. Just because someone who has a PhD in literature they automatically have all the answers and are  always right and get to make up al the rules? It is a sad state of affairs when we let someone who so openly hates and oppressed larger entities rule over all. Why are concise paragraphs the only sign of good writers? You can't be a good writer if you make your paragraphs a little on the hefty side? Whale I'll tell you what, they don't get to tell you what makes a good writer, only you do. You're the only one that matters, and I say make your paragraphs as big as you want and let your sentences run wild and free and hell don't even bother with punctuation Take back your freedom to express you self any way you want! Fight the man, man! If they don't like it they can just go back to not offering you professional work exactly how they were before you wrote that paragraph. And if the readers don't like it too bad, you don't need their stinking praise and applause!"

HPfanfiction,3dfj04,Lukc,10,Wed Jul 15 21:36:10 2015 UTC,Don't write too many
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,KwanLi,5,Thu Jul 16 00:09:06 2015 UTC,Let there be at least some doubt about who will win the fight.
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,KeriRussellBrand,5,Thu Jul 16 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"Also your protagonist has to lose at least one if not two battles. Make them retreat in agony. Have them be wiped and saved only because the antagonist was forced to retreat by arrival of reinforcements. Injure them and their friends, Let one or two be killed.  I'm rereading A Black Comedy for the dozenth time and I really like the battle with Voldemort because even though we know Harry's going to win just by the fact that it is more crack than not, it gets really close: both Harry and Sirius have the absolute shit beat out of them, and Harry's wand is exploded. Harry only wins because he had a backup weapon and that almost failed him too. On top of that, they are immediately forced to face an inquiry at the Ministry, a negative consequence of the battle, AND Voldemort wasn't even killed. He was back in action within hours."
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,NedryOS,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:33 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Curb-stomp battles can advance the plot and be realistic too.
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,Karinta,12,Fri Jul 17 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"Realism is very important for me. Real fights aren't clean, especially with cutting spells involved, blood, guts, viscera, screaming, panic. If transfiguration is involved not everyone is a master like Dumbledore, half-finished transfigurations should be a thing, a half-lion half-table, dragging itself towards the enemy. Combatants holding in their intestines begging for their mothers, friendly fire from spells cast out of desperation, shrapnel kills more people than direct fire in real combat, would be the same thing especially from Reducto spells.  If you want to get really graphic, use spells that boil the victims blood, melt them like the nazi's from Raiders of the Lost Ark, skeletons ripping themselves out of the victims body, spells that liquefy organs, eyeballs, shrivel skin like a dried fruit."
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,-Oc-,6,Wed Jul 15 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is very much good advice - and it goes for more than just magic duelling. If you're writing combat of any kind then it should not be clean. If you get into a fight in real life, you'll notice afterwards your knuckles might be slightly raw or skinned, you'll be badly bruised - blood from cut lips, swollen eyes, and that's if you came out of a fight well. People throw against a wall will probably catch their skin on a nail, rough surfaces will scratch you up. If you punch someone hard enough they might bite their tongue - replicate these dangers in duelling, even the more minor spells could cause side effects. Get hit by a banishing spell or anything that knocks you down? You could hit your head on the fall, dislocate your shoulder if you hit something at a bad angle, bite off a chunk of your tongue. In the wizarding world people can take a lot more damage and recover in a few days, so don't be afraid to actually have them take that kind of damage."
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,Robosprog,6,Wed Jul 15 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"Others have already made some excellent points. I would also say to be careful with pacing. Remember that the character is in the moment. This is not the time for an inner monologue, long death scenes, or long descriptions.  People should injure themselves or even die in really unglamorous ways. I don't like it when people come out of fights completely unscathed, they should be a bit banged up and a little dirty."
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,OwlPostAgain,6,Thu Jul 16 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"To start I would say avoid if possible the wand-gun problem of 'he was running low on energy and every spell his shield took meant another he couldn't cast.'  ie. it is guns, ammo, cover but magic without the feel of said magic.  Physically tiring is good but not magically exhausting.  Having read the Voldemort vs. Dumbledore fight fairly recently I would say this- that the greater the wizard the greater the ingenuity and variance.  The most important I think is that each spell/action is accomplishing multiple things.  Such as breaking the spell cast on them and turning that into an offensive weapon while moving into their next step.  They are always thinking steps ahead but can adapt.  This doesn't necessarily mean they know that many more spells (they do but not to the point where all their power comes from having memorized a million), rather it is their use.  ex. We don't know if the silver shield conjured is a) a purely magic shield such as protego, b) if it is a purely physical shield and if so whether it is pure silver or alloy etc. c) whether it is a combination- having been conjured and then imbued with protection etc.  I think the potency of the masters is getting more out of a simple spell, using it in inventive ways, and knowing it so well and working it until it can do extraordinary things.  Don't go on too long, often the information not said but only hinted at is all the more powerful.  Going into blow by blow can just make it a slog to read whether it is knife-stab, knife-stab or amazing ancient sumerian death magic with wand-incantation, wand-incantation.  At the same time while I agree realism is good and messy is good I would word it a different way.  Consequences are good, even with magic- permanently scarred, sickened, after effects.  Or given magics amazing healing possibilities make it matter such that the timing of events means getting injured here, even if mended within hours/days, means for example a critical team member being unavailable just when the info comes in on an important limited time event.  Also I would say that describing the effects of the magic in a real way is good (melting flesh etc.) but when writing I think you have to keep a focus so that the reader knows what is happening.  ie. in a magic fight a bit here or there to round out and make it feel like so much else is happening, and it is chaos is good.  Actually going into detail about every engagement and result is too much imo.  Rather keep it on Harry/POV character and then notice bits here and there while having the mass be immediate to him and his situation and goals.  Which is another thing- fights for fights sake I wouldn't recommend.  Even if a very talented writer the fight should be about more than the fight (it should be hero and goal-preferably as part of their overall goal- and then someone else, with their own goal, in his way).  ex. for me at least look at Star Wars IV-VI: choreography not the best but there is so much more going on (father vs son, using anger to wail on vader, realization and seeing his robotic hand etc.) which I find infinitely more riveting than the shallower lengthy pristine choreography found in Episodes I-III.  edit- Also joins with overall writing but keep power balance in check.  I heard Jim Butcher say that the protagonist should just have enough to survive- Like if you are a super advanced space marine with amazing tech and then are told that no soldier has all they want but just enough to maybe get by... well the point is no matter how awesome and powerful you get there should be other built up that are opposing him (to offer a real challenge and occasional setback).  PS This got me thinking back about a good write up Taure did on Horcruxes and their invulnerability being due to charms/magic applied and not because of the soul itself/being a horcrux.  This leads me to the point that if he can make a muggle paper diary, magic metal receptacles, and (iirc?) a live snake impervious to everything we know about bar Fiendfyre and Basilisk venom then did he do this to his own robe as well? (or himself in the dark rituals) or did Dumbledore to his own wardrobe? is that why Avada Kedavra is used so often and spells of such power that clang and reverberate of the shield Voldemort summoned are required? is this something that's been addressed before?  I know it doesn't take much to break the Potter world but even if Voldemort was selfish enough you'd think if this were possible Dumbledore would make up a set of holy underwear for his OotP members :P  Could be interesting anyway such that certain spells like the Dark Arts and great ingenuity in spell usage are required."
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,brucktoo,8,Thu Jul 16 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"Any magical battle outside of Hogwarts shouldn't involve spoken incantations, unless it's an Unforgivable Curse. Even those don't require it, but their use is often a game-changing moment, so speaking the spell is meant to intimidate the victim (and tell the reader 'we've just upped the ante').  Battles with mooks should leverage the spells we've seen- it bugs me sometimes when authors present 'adult' combat as not using the spells taught at Hogwarts. I admit that there must be more out there, but the foundation spells are taught because of their effectiveness- either from speed of casting or overall 'this is the best tool for the job'. Stunners were very effective during the battle in the Department of Mysteries- the mistake Harry and friends made was in not following through with a more permanent defeat for the stunned opponents.  That said, the battles with Big Bads should involve less blasters and more 'warp our local reality', as each of the major combatants attempts to surprise their opponents enough to unsettle them, then finish them off with the usual attack spells: Stun, Bind, Convert/Possess, Incapacitate or Kill.   Pacing is the biggest thing- you can't get wordy with the descriptions. It's better to use short actions during the firefight, followed by slow creeping and sneaking in the lull- that's when you get descriptive, because the viewpoint character has more time to take in these sorts of details.   EDIT: One more thought- any wizard with a wand and reasonable experience will defend against most spells unless they don't realize they're being attacked or the spell is too obscure- in which case their instinct should be to shield and/or shuffle off to a safer cover. A muggle can't resist the effects of spells, but wizards can, and if they're expecting a fight, they'll be ready with pre-made charms and a couple spells they know well."

HPfanfiction,3dfj04,albeva,2,Thu Jul 16 10:19:38 2015 UTC,"A sense of being inside your protagonist when they're fighting - a sense of realism with regard to what they're feeling and thinking, and a feeling that you know now exactly what it would be like. That's one of the things that is most important to me in any fic."
HPfanfiction,3dfj04,Karinta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"There are several aspects that you have to pay attention to:  The environment they are fighting in. Is it cramped, open, cluttered or clear? Is it outside or inside? Are there spectators, extra participants or is it a one-on-one thing?  The fighting style they employ. Are wands their primary duelling tools? Do they carry or use any other potential weapons? What about their strategy-in close or at range? How does this reflect on the tactics they employ in their chosen environment? What about what spells they use?  Ah yes, the spells. AOE or targeted? Fast or slow? Incantations or silent? Direct or indirect targeting? Defensive or offensive?  Accurate or sloppy? Spellchain or individual? Dodging, shielding or taking cover? Honorable or dirty?  Then there's the pacing to consider as well."

HPfanfiction,3dfu5o,dannndell,2,Thu Jul 16 17:07:32 2015 UTC,"Right. One of my posts got deleted, so here we go again.       Curse Breakers: The Maya is my favorite of the lot.     Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter.   Linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb): Best Slytherin Ginny Fanfic around.       Save Me: Another fun Slytherin Ginny story, abandoned early. Great character voice for Ginny.        My foot started tapping to the beat of my humming, impatiently waiting for the hat to get on with it. ""You will make your mark in—SLYTHERIN!"" I’ve never heard the Great Hall that silent. I’m talking crickets.   Linkffn(A Call to Arms by My dear professor McGonagall) is very good.       Linkffn(The enigmatic headmistress) has the same premise, with an excess of smut.         Linkffn(The albatross did follow by Chromeknickers) is an excellent story, with a Groundhog Day style Infinite Time Loop. It is Ginny/Draco, which I generally don't read, but this one's really good.        Linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire) features Ginny as the Hogwarts Champion for the TWT held in Beauxbatons. Takes place during her final year at Hogwarts.        Ginny Weasley and the Chamber of Secrets is CoS from Ginny POV.        Horrible brothers, unrequited love, and leaving home for the first timewhat else could possibly go wrong? Ginny Weasley is about to find out. FINISHED        Linkffn(The Rebirth by Irina) and Linkffn(Galatea by Irina) are both interesting, if not particularly high quality stories. Rebirth has a shaky start, but gets better later on.      Try Lady Darkness by Angstpuppies for a well written Dark!Ginny, though she isn't really the protagonist. Also a side of H/Hr.       Being possessed by Tom Riddle wrought changes in Ginny Weasley no one could have imagined. Six years after first finding the diary, she's reached her goal. Now, Harry and Order face their most difficult challenge: fighting a friend.      Compromise: A Love Story is an excellent oneshot, a brilliant portrayal of the post War Harry/Ginny relationship. One of my favorites and my headcanon too.  Hmm. Did I miss any?       Edit: Ignore the first one. Stupid Bot hates me."

We can gather the offer was a way to calm McGonagall down as she was rather stressed out. Combine that with the fact that he elaborated on the subject a little more than just a simple offer and you get a powerful first impression of a grampa who offers candy during tense times to help people calm down a bit.   If the books are anything to go by, Harry Potter's life is full of tense times."

There are probably some others I am forgetting.  My questions:  First, are there enough similarities that it feels gimmicky, like the author is saying ""hey look! She's just like Potter!""?  Second, if the similarities between HP and AQ are a bit overdone, does it matter?   Here is the post. You might find the responses I got helpful.

HPfanfiction,3dcyxr,Atheistical,7,Wed Jul 15 08:19:03 2015 UTC,"I imagine idle Bludgers make wanton arcs around the field, speeding along until it decides to change direction, with some enchantments to make it somewhat homing toward players. Enough to keep it interesting and keep it away from the audience, especially when it's struck by a bat.  I once wrote a story that shows Quidditch equipment being sentient (because the game can't get that much sillier), so there's also that."
HPfanfiction,3dcyxr,someorangegirl,2,Wed Jul 15 08:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think that Bludgers are commanded by enchantments to travel in random arcs, no matter what is in their path. The stands would have ""bludger repelling"" charms on them, to keep them in the field. This would explain why there are two bludgers in a game. The Snitch most likely has a similar enchantment except instead of random movement, it is enchanted to constantly evade capture. I also bet that the Hoops in Quidditch also are enchanted. Probably with a barrier charm to prevent bludger damage. Just my personal thoughts on the matter."
HPfanfiction,3dcyxr,Zerokun11,2,Wed Jul 15 08:42:58 2015 UTC,"Enchanted items are never really explained, so there's really no way to speculate on how they actually work according to canon, but it does seem that wizards can impart a sort of limited sentience to objects; mirrors that can comment on your appearance, portraits with the personality and some of the memories of their subject, flying cars that can go feral and rescue children from Acromantulas, etc. It's only full, human-level intelligence that arouses suspicion (like Riddle's diary) and seems to require Dark magic - but even that is possible.  I see no reason why a ball couldn't be enchanted to have an understanding of Quidditch and a basic mission - the Snitch flies around avoiding capture, much like the flying keys from the first book, while the Bludgers try to disrupt play by striking players with non-lethal blows. The enchanted chess set shows that enchanted items can have operational understanding of complex games, probably the witch or wizard's own understanding 'embedded' in the object by the enchantment.  As far as a fun, imaginative explanation: Bludgers are made of a Whomping Willow wood outer shell, a magically active wood of an aggressive nature, around a lead core (for weight) wrapped in a dragon-wing sinew netting (a core material that contains the essence of flight). They are crafted using a proprietary process, a Fidelius-protected trade secret of the International Quidditch Association since 1123 AD, combining elements of Broom and Wand-crafting to impart flight and basic magical sentience to the Bludgers, and then are enchanted to be aware of the rules of Quidditch and their role in the game."

HPfanfiction,3d8shj,frog_expert,17,Tue Jul 14 11:52:18 2015 UTC,"It should be interesting to get a new, adult protagonist. Harry is a good character to write, but sometimes the limits of his character can constrain you.  That said, Newt is going to have to do a lot to become Harry's equal.  I do wonder what tone the film is going to take, given that its main character is an adult, and given that there are now far more adult HP fans than kids. Will they shift the tone to something more mature to age along with the main body of fans? Or keep the ""children's fiction"" tone to try to win over a new generation of kids?  Of course I don't expect Game of Thrones sex, violence and rock and roll, but some increased maturity would be interesting."

Or keep the ""children's fiction"" tone to try to win over a new generation of kids?   I think a little of both, but i'm erring towards attracting a newer generation. There are going to be school age characters in it and it probably makes more sense to attract new viewers as existing fans will go and see it regardless of what age it's aimed at."
HPfanfiction,3d8shj,TheKnightsTippler,3,Tue Jul 14 12:41:47 2015 UTC,"The character Newt himself feels a fairly lighthearted. I think you've got it right, in that it will be a mix. Certainly there will be action, probably some death, but it won't be gritty. Unfortunately none of these will probably make an appearance: stark portrayals of most wizards' disdain for muggle life, magical fighting in WWI, taxidermy of Galapagos Pixies or rendering grindlows to their constituent parts for potions ingredients.  I think the HP book series probably has a lot of new-ish fans who will be excited for the movie Series like LOTR, Redwall, Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, etc stay popular. With how many copies of her books JRK has sold (around 500 million I think) I don't think it is in danger of losing popularity. The old farts (25-35 yr olds) who grew up going to midnight showings will be introducing their kids to the boooks too."

HPfanfiction,3d8shj,ImDepressedAsFuckAMA,6,Tue Jul 14 15:38:48 2015 UTC,It's a prequel so doesn't do much in the long run. It will give more back story and bring in more $ for an eventual(?) continuation of the main series. I suppose this could be one big litmus test for JKR to see if there is enough interest in writing more.   Would JKR greenlight movies taking place after HP & the Deathly Hallows without writing it in book form first? Maybe in 50 years when JKR is gone Disney will buy up the rights and have Brian Sanderson Jr. produce a new HP series.
HPfanfiction,3d8shj,CalcasieuRed,2,Tue Jul 14 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"JK says its not a prequel.  Although it happens before the originals and MUST reference the world, so i'm confunded."

HPfanfiction,3d8shj,CalcasieuRed,10,Tue Jul 14 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"It will definitely hurt/help fanfiction. One negative being what StudentOfMrKleks mentioned in this thread: the world building of some fanfics will clash with the newly revealed canon. The historical, political and geographical background of stories like Alexandra Quick or Bungle in the Jungle could be made non-canon compliant. Not a big deal, we'll still love those stories and there could be a new tag like AU denoting it a fanfic is disregarding the new film.   The film with give new characters and material to work with and more structure to the world. It will also give us new plot holes to fill and cliches to create/hate. It will most importantly give us new canon to distort, mangle, parody and throw-through-apparently-abundant-time-portals. Someone will make Newt will spend time pranking famous muggle botanists or something. One of Luna's NextGen, L-themed sprogs will travel back in time to save/destroy/accidentally-marry their great granddad Newt.  Or the gritty end of life view: It is 1996 Newt is old, will be dead soon, and reflects on his life. He sees the his world's careless destruction of magical species. His books led potion suppliers to untouched areas where they drove the wildlife to extinction. He helped create the Werewolf Registry in the 1940's with good intentions, but now he sees it being used to persecute and hunt down Lycanthropes (maybe a close friend is 'disappeared' by the ministry). The ministry warns him to be quite and play the part of a cultural icon. With the clarity of age he sees the oppression of sentient magical species that he did not do enough to change."

For the story that I'm currently working on, that new weird London play might just wreck it...but I've put a time stamp on it so people will know that it was written before the play/FBaWtFT. It's a little hard to find the motivation to write when I know it probably won't be 100% canon (I'm one of those weirdos who can only write canon), but I'm working hard.  It's very bittersweet.

HPfanfiction,3d9nxb,CalcasieuRed,6,Tue Jul 14 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"I've actually read it, it's really good, and not only for a self-insert fic. The main character seems to be hit and miss for a small percentage of readers, but if you read a few chapters and don't find anything wrong with him you should be fine.   Unfortunately, yeah, there aren't many decent SIs in the HP fandom. A curse of truth is pretty much the only complete one I'd recommend. SIs are pretty much my weak point and I've read an embarrassingly large number, so I'll give my opinions on the other recs in the thread.  Magical Me is good, but ends at an awkward point in the story and will leave you wanting for more, so only read it if you're desperate.   In Bad Faith is less a Harry Potter fic and more an exercise in pureblood worldbuilding (this might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your tastes). Also never updates.  I haven't read The Perks of Survival but I'll get right on it, will edit this post when I'm done. EDIT: Eh, I can't really see the appeal.

HPfanfiction,3d9nxb,CalcasieuRed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"I've read it and I was not a fan at all. First the protagonist was poorly written and spends most of the fic hitting on 11-14 year olds while being hinted at being in his late teens. The second gripe for me was the awful climax, much of the later half is spent angsting over ""what if they/Hermoine find out the truth"", but that confrontation ends up just being about his future knowledge, not the fact that he's from another universe and regards/regarded this one as fictional."
HPfanfiction,3d9nxb,DoubleFried,2,Wed Jul 15 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"Hermione is 15 and according to the writer he thought of the main character as around 18 years old. It's not that awful.

Having read the Naruto manga, if I ended up as a average ninja in the world, I'd probably bunker down and run to the hills whenever anything canon was too occur.  As a regular wizard, I think anyone not suffering from the J.K Rowling breed of plot-based idiocracy, and a dash of genre-savvy, would end up in a very good position in a very short amount of time.
