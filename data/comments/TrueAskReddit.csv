Texas is the only one that has its own power grid that is completely independent from the rest of the country. They are also pretty big and have a mixed economy of agriculture and industry.

Besides the federal government being one of the largest employers in Texas, a LARGE number of the businesses in Texas also rely entirely on federal government contracts.  If Texas ever seriously tried to secede, all of those would go away, and Texas would go bankrupt inside of a year or two.  As for the ""good number of military bases"" - who do you think OWNS those military bases?

TrueAskReddit,3dxu99,phatwithaphd,6,Mon Jul 20 14:58:19 2015 UTC,The idea that overhead costs should influence your choice of charity is flawed. http://overheadmyth.com/
TrueAskReddit,3dxu99,MistaSchlong,4,Mon Jul 20 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"This is a nonsense website. All charities should be actively working to put themselves out of business (I.e., end the problem that they contribute their charitable work towards); hence, ultimately, the only metric that really matters is results.   Instead, this website uses faulty and incomplete logic to argue that unreasonable overhead and marketing costs are ""good expenses.""  Overhead is NOT a myth. High overhead, unreasonable overhead, is a terrible thing in ANY organization."
TrueAskReddit,3dxu99,chiliedogg,0,Mon Jul 20 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"Among other arguments already made - there's the history and endowment status of the organization to consider.  If an old organization has a good endowment with enough interest to keep the charity's overhead to a minimum a higher percent of donations can go directly to the cause, but that doesn't mean it's doing it efficiently.    For instance, a charity that's mission is to supply school supplies for children may have an endowment that covers 100 percent of overhead, but the supplies they purchase are overpriced, low-quality, and supplied by the organization's president's cousin.  Meanwhile, there may be a new charity fulfilling the same mission, but they're building an endowment AND have to pay their overhead, so they may only spend 50 percent on the school supplies, but they're being smart in their purchases and getting better supplies for half the cost.  So even with that extreme overhead, they're the better investment.  They're already doing more good than the 100 percent funded charity, and as their endowment grows they'll do even more good.  Using overhead costs as your deciding factor in this extreme case would be supporting inefficiency and corruption."
TrueAskReddit,3dxu99,phatwithaphd,2,Tue Jul 21 01:10:47 2015 UTC,"The point of this website is the same as your first point. The only metric that really matters is results. Using overhead costs as a metric is not useful, because having a high overhead does not mean that a charity isn't efficient at getting results.  The overhead myth is ""the false conception that financial ratios are a proxy for overall nonprofit performance. While overhead can help us identify cases of fraud or gross mismanagement and serve as a part of an organization’s dashboard of financial management metrics, it tells us nothing about the results of your work (i.e., how you meet your mission).""  I don't see how you're taking that to mean that they justify ""unreasonable overhead"" as a ""good expense."" They are arguing that overhead is simply not a good metric and gets too much focus as such. (I can't find the word ""unreasonable"" on their website and I think that your using it is intellectually dishonest.)  And as for it being a ""nonsense website,"" it is at the very least advocated for by Peter Singer, who has written a book on the subject of charitable donations called ""The Most Good You Can Do"" and runs a website specifically dedicated to finding the best and most efficient charities."

I think these differences can be subtle (though substantial) and it will certainly require more thinking on my part before I can give you an equally fair reply. (So, please, I hope you will grant me some time to think about this.)  Also, Peter Singer is a great guy and a fine scholar, but just as you seem to consider his advocacy a suitable metric for determining the trustworthiness of a non-profit-related website, I absolutely do not consider his advocacy an acceptable metric for determining operational effectiveness or for determining dependability of a website speaking to operational effectiveness.

It's the only agency like that I'm familiar with, but if the others are similar, my advice would be to find other means.  First off, all our staff were paid salespeople, and some of them were very well-paid.  I did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation one day and decided that our payroll had to be at least 10k/week.  I don't know how much money we took in, but I'm certain that most of it stayed with us.  I got the impression the charities looked at this kind of campaign as self-funding advertising and not much else, especially the smaller or less recognised ones.  Secondly, the owner was a smiling psychopath who ran a series of just-this-side-of-legal businesses.  His 'Christmas gift' to the staff one year was the chance to join a pyramid scheme.  I don't trust him to do the right thing with your money if there's any other option open to him.  Other owner-operators might be different, but the whole industry struck me as pretty sleazy.  I wouldn't have been there if I didn't need a job so badly.  And thirdly, some of the organisations we campaigned for didn't seem entirely legit.  I'm more than half sure some of them were just selling their reputation to private fundraisers like we were.  I know for a fact that at least one of them diverted money we raised for counselling to conveniences for their paid staff.  So when you get cold-called, my advice would be the ask the difficult questions: are you a private fundraising company, do you work for multiple charities or just one, how much money goes to the charity, do they open their ledgers to public scrutiny, etc.  If the caller doesn't know or won't say, be very careful."

This means that the member state of the Eurozone are beholden to other states in terms of the currency, but have no ability to make independent economic decisions on most issues. This causes issues- one very popular strategy for getting out of a recession is to weaken your currency, making exports cheaper, thus boosting them and strengthening the economy. This type of policy isn't available for member states of the EU- when Greece or Ireland or Spain (etc.) face a recession, they cannot simply inflate their debts away- they are beholden to the other members states and their (often conflicting) agendas."

There will then be some particular policy setting that works best for any given area and most helps them economically.  Across a larger area, you'll have sub-areas that would benefit from different policy - states in the US, countries in the EU, possibly even cities within a state, so when you have them share a currency (and thus force them to share the same monetary policy) there will be some areas that do better than others. But if you can tax the area that's doing best and redistribute to the area that's lagging then it'll relieve the tension created.  But that only works if people in the richest areas feel enough common-cause with those being helped that they don't complain (too much) about being taxed to subsidise them.

TrueAskReddit,3dqzzx,tobiasvl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"Blue states emphasis on finance, trade, and knowledge and education makes for a lot of middle upper class blue people.

TrueAskReddit,3dqzzx,SiberianShibe,2,Sun Jul 19 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"I watched the vlogbrothers video today. Basically, it boils down to the fact that with the Euro, the countries control spending while the EU controls the printing of the money. Greece needs the EU to print more money, but the rest of the countries, like Germany and France, don't want them to. The majority wins out and Greece is SOL.  With the US, the Federal government controls the spending and printing of money. If problems with the economy need us to print more money, we can."
TrueAskReddit,3dqzzx,ctrl2,3,Sun Jul 19 06:35:36 2015 UTC,"Here's a great lecture on the topic.. His main points are:   Workforce mobility. The workforce in the US is mobile while it is not in Europe. This is evident by the 26% unemployment (and 50% youth unemployment) in Greece, and similar for Spain. If the workforce was mobile these unemployed would just move elsewhere to get a job. A system of ""risk sharing"". In the US, if one area fails economically, there is a redistribution of wealth directly into the affected area via unemployment benefit, etc. This is obviously not the case in Europe."
TrueAskReddit,3dqzzx,POGO_POGO_POGO_POGO,2,Sun Jul 19 04:23:55 2015 UTC,"I suspect that the recent focus on Greece is the biggest reason for recent focusing on the negatives of the Euro. Many comments suggest that wealth transfers are the reason the US does not face this problem, yet Europe (via the EU) does feature a system for such transfers. Weathier EU members pay a higher fee for membership, whereas poorer members benefit from a larger amount of EU spending. (See here for a breakdown by country http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/money/expenditure/index_en.htm). I think that European economic woes tend to put the spotlight on the relatively young single currency area, whereas similar issues in the US focus on other factors rather than the US dollar's role in that problem."

TrueAskReddit,3dqzzx,thehillshaveaviators,0,Sat Jul 18 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"A big issue that I haven't seen raised is imports/exports. A nation like Greece should be an exporter. I italicized ""should"" because it can't as a Euro-user.  Because the French and German economies are so strong, the Euro is one of the strongest currencies in the world. That's a problem for a small, weaker market like Greece. If Greece had its own currency, it would have a favorable exchange rate with not just the Euro but also the USD, CAD, yen, etc., which would allow their product to be cheap and importable by those countries. But, with a strong Euro, Greece can't export their goods because the exchange rate isn't favorable for them, and for that they can't even get people to invest in the country.  In short, Greece and the other weak European economies are doomed unless (a) they received tax redistribution from the stronger countries (à la the U.S. States), or (b) they leave the Euro."

TrueAskReddit,3di3ay,willkydd,2,Fri Jul 17 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"I'd also say general financial ignorance is another reason on top of this.  Kids aren't even taught basics about credit cards, debt, interest rates, etc in high school (at least in America).  This is critical life information that's assumed to be passed down from the parents for some reason.  Unfortunately, lot of parents are also in debt and don't understand the basics either.  When kids go off on their own in college and post grad life, they are immersed in debt and digging their way out is their learning experience.  We need knowledge, so we can be better at prevention and damage control.  Ignorance was my situation.  I got a credit card in high school.  I had no idea how the concept of credit worked.  I just knew it had a limit, and I couldn't get over that, and I had to make monthly payments.  I made the minimum monthly payment with my part time job cash, and by the end of high school, I had a credit card around  $1,200 in debt.  I did not know that at the time, however.  I wasn't aware my interest rate was incredibly high due to my age and lack of credit, and my minimum payment went almost entirely just to interest.  I was just wasting money.  My parents were aware of the card but didn't have the general understanding to teach me about it.  They told me to get it, and it'd benefit me for college.  They didn't analyze the plan and spot the horrendous interest rates.  They didn't warn me of the problems you can get into.  They were in their own financial mess.    Anyway, to make a relatively long story short, I forgot about the card, as I was told by my parents they'd take care of the payments while I was away in college.  The problem is, they couldn't afford it.  Payments were missed.  Delinquency notices were ignored.  I wasn't informed of any of this.  The card went delinquent and tossed around credit agencies for years.  I didn't learn this until I was out of college at 22 years old and tried to sign my first apartment lease.  I was declined.  My credit score was pretty much as low as you can get.  After a dozen or so phone calls, I finally tracked down which credit agency owned my card.  At this point, it tallied about $2,500 in total fees.  I was able to pay it off the following year (which was an amazing feeling).  I was lucky, because $2,500 isn't that much, but it was an incredible learning experience.  I took control of my credit and debt management right then and there and haven't looked back.  That's not the case for a lot of people though.  They have 10, 20, 50 times that debt at a young age and can't control it.  I do not blame my parents at all.  I was upset they didn't tell me about delinquent payments for over 4 years, but I was just as responsible for just handing it off to them and figuring it would just be taken care of.  That's just not how things work.  You have to take care of your own problems.  However, this is just one reason we critically need a Debt Management 101 class or Introduction to Credit class in high school.  These classes are critical life lessons we need to be taught at a young age.  tl;dr Ignorant teenage me got a credit card in high school and forgot about it until after college.  $2,500 in delinquency fees destroyed my credit."
TrueAskReddit,3di3ay,Bonowski,3,Fri Jul 17 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"I hear this being said a lot these days, that there needs to be a class that teaches how to manage money. They have two in my state, home ec. and economics, and they're both go in depth on credit, taxes, and money management. They can't teach to always save, which is what I think you would want being taught, because that's not sound economic advice.   The classes I took taught that with every economic decision you take a risk. No one really knows whether or not they end up being good decisions until they've already been made, and often with the assumption that no changes will be taking place that will end up causing a bad outcome. Your parents didn't want to not have the money to pay for your card, and they could've easily earned the money another way, but those are economic decisions your parents might not have had available at that time for reasons unique to their situation.   Most economic decisions are good if there's always enough money to offset any risk, not something the average person has the ability to ensure before needing to make decisions. You could've just as easily chosen not to go to school until you had the money to pay for it up front, a wise economic decision, but you'd miss out on the gains that would come from the kind of job that that degree would make available, making it a dumb decision. How it would it be possible to teach that a decision can be both wise and dumb at the same time? We don't do either, we teach the basics, give clear examples, and try to make it relatable to whichever economic situation we're in at any given moment. Teaching students to always be saving isn't wise, there are always too many unknown variables that can come into play at anytime."

You're complaining that people think they can't succeed in life by doing work that doesn't require a degree, and therefore get a degree and complain about their loans.  I quite agree with both of your points, that one can lead a perfectly acceptable life doing blue collar work and that there are alternatives to paying one's student loans.

I hardly think everyone shunning the military buys into the ""poor"" stigma you mentioned.

What can't be taught with real money can be taught with resources that even young children understand.  The takeaway is that no one will rescue you from your choices.  ""If you eat all that candy now, you won't have any later"", if properly enforced, is an important lesson in finances.

If it costs more than that to buy and repair the car, get another car from somewhere else instead. At the end, your car is paid off, runs well, and did I mention that it is paid off in full?

TrueAskReddit,3di3ay,Whats_a_narwhal,16,Sat Jul 18 03:23:08 2015 UTC,"The majority of my debt is from College. I have two credit cards as well, but their max (which is maxed) is 1k (mostly due to college costs before I figured out the fin. aid. gamut). My debt outside of College debt is roughly 2k, about 1k of that being for College.     In my personal experience it comes from low-wage jobs--paying under what is called ""living-wage."" Essentially, unless you make (example based on my locale) $13.10/hr at a f/t job, you are expected to gradually slide into debt every year. I'm not exactly sure what the MIT calculator takes into consideration. Obviously things like car breakdowns, or medical emergencies would quite easily knock-out any savings, if one is lucky enough to have savings. Having that in mind--saving becomes, in a sense, futile. Why work more hours, penny-pinch expenditures, to only save $50-100 a month, $1200? The GB&U quote: ""If you work for a living, then why do you kill yourself working?"" That spare-change ends up being used for fun or entertainment, and I mean--why not? Fuck it--I just worked 40+ hours this week I want to go to the g-d damn arcade and eat pizza, or something.   Nonetheless, this low-wage routine becomes cyclical (""poverty-cycle""); saving money is too much of task, and not really worth it. Nonetheless the expenses come in--gradually racking up year after year, diverted through more credit. There are other things too it--less financial and more existential; constant dejection, alienation, low-self esteem, etc. It takes a toll on the mind, trust me.   Money operates a lot differently depending on the level of income, and liquid-cash you have available; even in the grocery store the lesser amounts of food cost more per #. Some people don't have the cash to buy the $12 bag of chicken. So they buy the $5 bag of chicken, despite it being $1 more per #--they run out of chicken sooner, and end up spending more over the long-run. Are you repairing that lemon POS car, or are you buying a decent used car to replace it, one that won't fall apart every month. I could go on.   Moreover--the middle class seems to be getting rocked on Obama-care; the more money you make the more fiscal responsibility you have on yourself. My friend cleared 28k last year, had to pay in $500 for taxes for OC. I think my dad, fresh into disability, has to pay like $450 a month for his health insurance. There's still a deductible he has to reach until they pay-out for anything; there's still a copay at each visit; there's still an excessive cost on top of the excessive monthly cost.   The odds are stacked against the majority of people in terms of financial freedom, in terms of being debt free.   But I look at my -40k self and, really, I'm not that concerned. I'll probably not pay the CC or Medical bills. I don't have the cash right now--is there a benefit to paying a collections agency? I'm not sure there is (Ohhh, you can haggle them by the way--the longer you hold out the cheaper your debt becomes!). Maybe for housing, or car loans. But, I think if you make a decent yearly wage, they overlook the abysmal C-score.   Of course, if I get a decent job where paying it back isn't a huge struggle, I'll gladly pay back. I'm into this option. I'd rather be a ""upstanding-citizen"" who pays their bills. But, I've learned to act ""me first."" Sometimes paying debts get you no where--if not further into debt."

I'm going to be finishing school in December and I really hope I can land a job when I graduate that pays enough to afford stuff but still be able to go have fun at the end of the week like you said. Because it's inevidable that you'll want to have fun at the end of a work week and try to unwind, if you don't you'll begin to drive yourself crazy.

Combine that with the idea that you must attend college and drown yourself in loans being ingrained in every young student's mind, you get large amounts of people in debt who don't make nearly enough to pay it off within a reasonable amount of time.  As well, a lot of people don't fully understand credit or debt. They see a $30,000 car and normally would probably not be able to afford it. But wait! The salesman said he can get my monthly payments down to something manageable (Say $300 or something). That's not so bad! Only thing is, that's on an 84 month loan at exorbitant interest rates.  My former co-worker just got hit with that last one. He traded up from his 2014 Subaru Impreza to a 2015 Subaru WRX. Says it's an 84 month loan.   Eighty. Four. Months.  He's 24 now, so he'll be paying off that car sometime when he's 31. I didn't even know you could get an 84 month loan."

If I had the option of buying a car I can buy outright for sub-$7,500, or getting a 4-year loan at a low interest rate for a substantially nicer car, I would take the nicer one every time.  You seem to be at the other extreme of car-buying that plagues /r/personalfinance. Not to say it's a bad thing, but keep in mind it won't apply to everyone.  My co-worker from my example definitely went to the other extreme with such a long loan, but getting a 4-year loan at a low interest rate isn't necessarily a bad financial decision. He's big into cars, so I can understand spending a bit more than the average person on one, but he went so far past his level of affordability."

Why do people have this mentality that they ""deserve"" something nice? They go into debt and then they are just slaves to their debt. Mahhhh. It makes me sad for them because I know what pain debt can cause. Any instability (and instability will occur) and you're stuck.  A friend of mine took out a car loan and has student loans. She got a job, but then she had an adequate cause to suddenly quit her job. Then, she had no money, and debt payments stacking up. It was a modest car loan, yes. But, she couldn't afford it anymore.

Once you accumulate equity in the property you can then monetize it fairly easily by renting it out or selling it if the market goes up substantially.  In addition, housing is a necessary cost regardless. Unless you are living with family or in some other rent-free situation you are going to be paying out money every month to have a place to live. You may as well be building equity when you do so.  Finally, the tax write-off from the interest is fairly substantial.   I'd recommend talking to a financial advisor and running some numbers before discarding the notion of buying real estate."

People see an increase in pay as a way to increase their lifestyle. They make no attempt to save. They live at, or above, their means, and go into debt doing so.  I have a friend who complains about money constantly. She says she ""lives"" paycheck to paycheck. But there is a huge difference between living paycheck to paycheck and simply spending all your money before your next paycheck. She isn't poor AT ALL. She just spends all of her money. If she gets a bonus, or any other extra money, she immediately thinks of something else as a ""need"" and the money is all of the sudden spoken for! She pretty much saves nothing. I make substantially less money than her but I am able to save much more simply due to living a more reasonable lifestyle.  It's a mindset that many Americans have.

Then my wife started having some trouble with her back (spinal stenosis) and we needed to get a new mattress to help with that. We also had a ton of other 'little' things that needed to be taken care of, so we got a $13k loan to take care of it all. We're still workin' on that one.

TrueAskReddit,3d95kf,Mako18,92,Tue Jul 14 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"The colonisation of the two continents took place several centuries apart. Further, America received immigrants from a much wider range of sources, particularly German and French. Australia, on the other hand, was entirely governed by the British and saw very little in the way of immigration from the other European powers. Finally, there wasn't much of a push for a distinct ""Australian identity"" until the dissolution of the British Empire itself, whereas the generations following the American revolution were very keen on establishing their own identity separate from the homeland.  As a result, Australian dialects are much closer to the British source than American ones, and share a lot more in terms of slang, idioms, and other grammatical oddities."

What's ridiculous is that as soon as a rule is put into place that benefits the people, our representatives not only want to overturn it, but also block any similar rules like it from ever existing in the future.

I am going to pull a few quotes from here that talk about life back then and then compare that to now.   During 1701, seven public wells were constructed in the city. These were built in the middle of the streets, and were especially designed for security against fires. Water was generally scarce and bad.  In 1706 Francis Makemie who is considered the founder of the Presbyterian church in America, being arrested in New York for preaching without a license.   [1712] First reported slave revolt in NYC; twenty slaves hanged after nine whites were killed.    Around 1700 NYC had a population of around 5000 so it would be considered pretty tiny by today's standards.  If I were to guess what this person were to think waking up on a bench they would first say nothing.  They would be overwhelmed by the sights and sounds coming from all around them.  They would hear car horns and the roar of the city, which would likely be more sound at once than they have ever heard.  They would probably see the shiny buildings reflecting sunlight and more people in one area then they thought possible.  The variety of people and fashion would also overwhelm them.  For the first little while they would be completely overwhelmed, probably saying nothing.  They might just wander around a while trying to figure out what is going on. Assuming they spoke to people I would imagine eventually they would be turned over to the police or make their way to a social services group.  I think they would be drawn to a church as that would be familiar to them.  They would likely be considered crazy (as no one would believe their story) and would enter into the system as someone who has a mental disorder.  They would likely be in a homeless shelter (or stay in a church) for a good while and beg for food and money.  Eventually they would adjust over the next few months or years as to how to live life."

Even if we ignore the fact that austerity is only going to hurt the common Greeks, people who had no hand in crafting policy (funny how people only start claiming modern representative governments are truly democratic when it suits their argument) it doesn't change the fact that this is a moral statement not an economic one.   It is a notion informed purely by ideas of the morality of debt. That if you owe something you are morally obligated to repay it. Ok let's all agree that's true, what does it have to do with sensible macroeconomic policies? And what of those who so irresponsibly loaned the money?  And that's where the rubber meets the road, if we has a global society have decided that nation states should have to repay debts no matter what then we have incentivized irresponsible loans and investments. Isn't the whole idea of financial capital that good investments succeed and bad investments fail? If the bankers get paid no matter what then they'll just keep doing this. Smaller countries will just keep defaulting and will keep being forced to adopt neoliberal austerity and privitization policies.   Now were I a more cynical man I might be inclined to believe that that's the goal. But that'd just be crazy right?

Basically, Greece is now a  de-facto puppet state of the international finance community, even if there's a democratically elected figurehead running things and ""agreeing"" to give up Greek assets."
TrueAskReddit,3d58cn,Mikeavelli,3,Tue Jul 14 23:25:38 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know what that is. I'm sure that there's an arsenal of political weapons available to Germany and the EU that we aren't aware of.   I'm also interested to know what sort of administration Greece ""agrees"" to go under.   We're at a crossroads here with how Greece is going to be treated under the terms of this new deal. Are they going to be seen as debt addicts to be rehabilitated? Or an economicly defeated state that must submit to the victorious econommic powers?   For the sake of international stability, I seriously hope that the EU chooses the former. The international community dosen't have a very good track record with the latter."
TrueAskReddit,3d58cn,Chinaroos,9,Mon Jul 13 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"The arsenal is simply not caring about the Greek Citizens or the stability of the Greek State.  EU Ministers can simply point out exactly how Greece will suffer from a Grexit, and how they won't be obligated to help out at all - and wait for Tsipras to blink.  The goal now is to punish Greece, and punish Syriza, for having tried to renegotiate the terms of their debt.  This way the European Union can take aside any other country that might want to try and renegotiate (Spain, Portugal, Italy) - and give them an example of why it would be a very bad idea to pull this kind of stunt again.  So, the international stability the EU cares about in this circumstance isn't for Greece, it's for everyone else.  It's an open argument whether this will be beneficial (other tottering countries are 'scared straight') - or harmful (this example persuades the rest of Europe that maybe union isn't such a great deal.  Maybe the EU doesn't have their back).  It'll also provide a new home for radicals and terrorists with a free pass to enter into the rest of Europe.    You've got something like half the young men in Greece having no job, nothing holding them down, and a seething hatred of Germany.    I don't know what's going to happen, but I know it isn't going to be good."
TrueAskReddit,3d58cn,Mikeavelli,6,Mon Jul 13 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"The potential radicalization of Greece is what concerns me.  So far we've been lucky in that there hasn't been a 'strain' of terrorism that's been attractive in Europe beyond radical Islam. A secular motivation for terrorism, and lack of foresight in how to combat it, can have major impacts on both Europe and the US.  The weakening of Greece can also open up Greece to influence from Russia.  Greece needs to be rebuilt, not taken apart. I agree that this could go very poorly for NATO countries in the long run if the EU focuses too much on punishing Greece."
TrueAskReddit,3d58cn,Chinaroos,2,Mon Jul 13 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that there's an arsenal of political weapons available to Germany and the EU that we aren't aware of.    It's rather simple: Greece needs a lot of money. No one is willing to give it to them at all... except the ESM, which is only ready to loan them the money under certain (admittedly rather draconian) conditions. This puts Greece in a bad bargaining position and Tsipras has finally understood that.  On the other hand you have to understand the ESM members. They need to ensure that Greece pays back the money - especially after all the trust the current greek government has squandered."
TrueAskReddit,3d58cn,MartianSky,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"What impacts will a capitulation from Tsipras going to have within Greece?   I totally agree that Greece's economy can't function in its current form. Greece simply cannot have a stable and functioning country with a culture of tax evasion like there is in Greece, especially for an economy that relies so much on tourism.   However with the new agreement containing such items like the ""valuable Greek assets"" blaming rich Western Europe (and Germany especially) is going to be political heroin for Greece domestically. That combined with the coming impoverishment and humiliation is going to lead to perfect conditions for secular radicalization.   Right on the EU's doorstep too. That's not good at all.   Personally, I think that the best solution would be to shoot for an economic Marshall plan rather than an economic Versailles. But I don't think that's going to happen unfortunately"

TrueAskReddit,3d58cn,emptyhunter,0,Tue Jul 14 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Some have argued that Greece has essentially become a colony or a vassal of the EU, but I think that's rather extreme.  They have given up a lot of sovereignty, however, and there was a push for Greek assets to be essentially seized, held in Luxembourg by a newly-created agency (the Germans called it ""holding in trust"") and to be swiftly privatized. The Greek government resisted this, but agreed to privatize the assets (50bn EUR worth).    The willingness of the rest of the EZ to rake on the burden of full governance.   The EU countries would not want that headache and that responsibility. They also don't want to take the blame for their demonstrably flawed policies. Imagine if the Troika had actually taken up the government of Greece and pushed through all the previous austerity: they'd be responsible for a depression greater than that seen in the US during the 1930s, and would have no ""profligate Greek government"" to blame it on.  Euroscepticism is currently on the rise in the EU, and the narrative that is quickly gaining credence thanks to people like Nigel Farage and other prominent eurosceptics is that the EU is a fundamentally undemocratic institution ran by elites in Brussels that don't give a damn about democracy. These people argue that the EU is an empire that seeks power above all else. They argue that the EU seeks to dissolve the nation states of Europe until they become a single European superstate (protip: this part of the argument, that the EU is meant to supersede nations, is more or less accurate).   Obviously the EU has an interest in not proving the eurosceptics right, so they wouldn't just take a country over. They're a lot more subtle in applying pressure to get what they want, as we've seen over the past few days, but one must take care to remember that the Greek negotiations show that it's still the heads of state in Europe that hold the real cards, not the European Commission or European Parliament.   EDIT: Plus, the Greeks already plaster caricatures of Merkel wearing a Nazi uniform on the front page of their newspapers. If the EU was to take over, the parallels between that action and the Nazi occupation of Greece during WWII would be too great to ignore. People wouldn't lie down without a fight."

TrueAskReddit,3d3m8s,hbomb30,15,Mon Jul 13 06:55:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, barring a complete civilization collapse and a consummate reduction in carbon emissions.  In that, we're pretty much hosed.  That said.  There are many options on the table to mitigate it through geoengineering. For example, putting sulfides in the air has been proposed as a solution to Global Warming since the LBJ Administration(as in, government scientists proposed it in a report). Putting this into the air would reduce the luminosity of the sun by enough to cool the planet. There doesn't seem to be any real doubt that it's within our technical abilities. There are a few problems with it:   It doesn't do a damn thing for the acidification of the oceans, which will keep on absorbing huge amounts of carbon. So the temperature may cool/plateau but the oceans would be just as dead. It might do some damage to the ozone layer Screwing with the amount of light coming in might screw with plant life It would likely encourage people to kick the can down the road regarding carbon emissions, which doesn't really solve the underlying problem. Why cut emissions if we can just keep making the sky darker?   Another option is ""iron fertilization"" in order to induce plankton blooms that would sequester large amounts of carbon in the ocean with less ocean acidification.  That has some problems as well:   It'll require a staggering amount of iron, I think I read somewhere that it requires 90% of the annual iron production on the planet to induce a bloom large enough to significantly offset the carbon levels. It could potentially cause a toxic ""red tide"". and just as with cloud seeding, it might make people think we can not worry about reducing carbon emissions.   Ultimately, geoengineering has to be done hand in hand with drastic cuts in carbon emissions being made. Some of this will be happening organically(like once self-driving cars proliferate), but I doubt that that can be achieved without government intervention."

But things will get worse the longer we take to correct them, so at the same time it isn't too late to stop it.

As far as our reliable climate records go, the past 12000 years of relative stability is an outlier.   If you're defining ""global warming"" as any change, such as might flood some islands or change some weather patterns, then yes it's completely ""too late"". The degree of oncoming changes is very hard to estimate, though.  If you mean catastrophic, civilization-dooming changes, then the answer is ""maybe"". AFAIK (and I'm not a scientist), it could be that the amount of carbon and heat we've introduced into the climate will keep pushing the system into some sort of dramatic change, or it's possible it needs some more ""push"".   We should be limiting our impact as much as possible, as quickly as possible, because as it is it's like we're playing russian roulette. We keep spinning and shooting, but we have absolutely no idea when we've ""doomed"" ourselves, and we may not know for a generation.  As someone else said, Earth isn't doomed, it's fine, it's not going anywhere. Humanity isn't even doomed, but civilization as we know it is in danger.

The acidification of our oceans is something that truly worries me, but I'm still reading up on the matter. But I think this is what we should focus on.

Issue 1: the test. Have you ever looked at the voter tests given to blacks during the Jim Crow era? Not only are they very difficult, but several of the questions are able to be interpreted different ways. This allowed the test-giver to say that the answers were wrong, no matter what they were. These tests were put in place by the people in power in order to limit people from removing them from power.   It's the same thing with gerrymandering. The people in charge are also in charge of setting districts, which can be done in such a way to  stop rivals from ever being elected. So the question is, how can you possibly design the test impartially, and guarantee that it will remain impartial? Controlling who can vote is the ultimate power in this country, many people will try to get their fingers in it.   Issue 2: where do you cut it off? What is a legitimate level of political knowledge? Is it enough to know the general tenets of the parties you're voting for (which is fairly reliable but still vague), or do you need to know specific facts about your candidate? What if only 10% of the country is able to vote by those standards, is it really a democracy then?   (Side note: democracy has often been criticized as ""mob rule"", with good reason)  Furthermore, if it was 10%, that minority would have an impetus to keep it at 10%. The people that didn't meet their definition of smart would seem like a risk to them. And, being in power, they could effectively legislate those people to never have a vote again  Issue 3: fundamental attribution error. I'm sure there people on the other end of the political spectrum from you that seek stupid. Making absolutely asinine decisions that hurt us all. The problem is, they feel the same way about you. And neither of you is quite right! What you define as smart, they think is stupid. What you think is backwards, they think is unwise. A test would be a battlegrounds for such ingrained ideologies, because how do you separate objectively smart from what seems smart?  And finally, issue 4: we can't measure people very well. There's not a lot of ways to figure out if group A is better than group B, which will stand up to varied testing.   I list these issues because I care about the things that you talk about. Our political system is fucked because people run it, a problem that governments have always had. You just can't trust people to do the right thing, which is why you can't give any small group power if you can help it. It's why we have checks and balances in our government.

Every serious historian agrees that she never said ""let them eat cake.""  The earliest record we have of that phrase comes from John-Jacques Rosseau, who accuses Marie-Therese of saying it - though he accuses her when Antoinette was a little girl, and hadn't even set foot in France yet.  Louis XVI was a good, albeit modest leader, who had big dreams for France and worked hard to attempt to quell the growing British presence in India and North America.  He was the third son, and so not expected to inherit, and certainly not educated to inherit, but still won the respect and begrudging admiration of the rest of Europe in his early 20s.  The army with which Napoleon conquered Europe was largely built up and innovated by Louis.   He was amazingly devout (in an age where a lot of leaders merely gave lip-service), and even prayed that God would forgive his captors and killers as they marched him to his death.  Even those of non-monarchist sympathies now decry (and many did at the time) his murder by the state.    A common quote that armchair historians like to sling about is, ""History is written by the victors.""   Well, that is the case here.   ""Marie Antoinette was a dumbass, her husband was inept and corrupt.  Columbus proved the world wasn't flat.""  These are facts that ""everybody knows"", and carry the weight of popular opinion and mythology, but they absolutely crumble under any sort of inquiry.  It's just not true.    If you wanted to use a bad monarch to refute my point, maybe Ashoka, who had a very bloody early reign, and conquered, killed, and deported hundreds of thousands of his enemies... but even then, during the war, he came to see the ugliness of violent and converted to Buddhism, spreading learning across the Indian subcontinent..."

TrueAskReddit,3crkmu,Bl4nkface,6,Fri Jul 10 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"First of all, I used ""own"" in scare-quotes for a reason.  Because I know a dynasty doesn't literally have a deed to every piece of land in the kingdom or state.    That said, barring any sort of war or succession crisis, a king or queen gives the keys of the kingdom to their child, who gives it to their child, etc., etc.  They pass on the reins to their children.  People don't like to gamble with that sort of thing, which is why, for example, monarchical wars were often limited, with very clearly defined goals.     It is little coincidence that we see the advent of the concept of Total War and ideological wars alongside the rise of democracy.   A king just wants that piece of land or those trading rights.  He goes to war, and either gets them or doesn't.  However, with democratic wars, we are now fighting ""to make the world safe for democracy,"" or ""war on terror."" (Though, certainly, technological advances play a role as well - no historical development is because of one thing.)   Nebulous wars with loosely-defined victory concerns, in which every civilian has become an unwitting participant.  If you're North American like me, it might be hard to conceptualize, but consider the bombings of London, Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki.  Or even more recently, Bosnia and Iraq.  The majority of those people that died in those attacks didn't sign up to fight anyone.   We in the west cry about 9/11, and certainly it was a vicious attack, but for the rest of the world, it is business as usual when ""democracies"" go to war.  A kingdom has never nuked anyone, and I doubt a kingdom ever will.   1) A king doesn't ""own"" its his kingdom.   2) Being a king means that he can use his powers to fulfill his own desires and don't give a fuck.   Which is it?

Have you ever looked at the voter tests given to blacks during the Jim Crow era?   Nope, but this test is about intelligence, not race, it is not about discrimination.   This allowed the test-giver to say that the answers were wrong, no matter what they were.   I have in mind a system that works better as computerized not a systematic discrimination.   Controlling who can vote is the ultimate power in this country, many people will try to get their fingers in it.    We are controlling so the commoners can't vote, you see how political environment is so polluted.   Issue 2: where do you cut it off? What is a legitimate level of political knowledge? Is it enough to know the general tenets of the parties you're voting for (which is fairly reliable but still vague), or do you need to know specific facts about your candidate?    You have to understood, high school level basic level of how government functions. You have to be aware of the issues that faces the country.   What if only 10% of the country is able to vote by those standards, is it really a democracy then?    It doesn't have to be a democracy. It will be a system government by intelligent beings.   Issue 3: fundamental attribution error. I'm sure there people on the other end of the political spectrum from you that seek stupid. Making absolutely asinine decisions that hurt us all. The problem is, they feel the same way about you. And neither of you is quite right! What you define as smart, they think is stupid.   It doesn't have to be out their political views, more about their intelligence. Radical ideas are encouraged , creativity is needed. I don't want like-minded people, I want intelligent people. I feel safer knowing the guy in front of me is intelligent yet is on the other end of the spectrum.   A test would be a battlegrounds for such ingrained ideologies, because how do you separate objectively smart from what seems smart?   I will let the intelligent people decide in the top universities create the test. It is more about how your brain function than more about what your views are.   You just can't trust people to do the right thing   I think you can, if they are intelligent you can. If this system moves ahead there will be a record that is being kept on the honesty and truthful levels.   which is why you can't give any small group power if you can help it.    Better give 3 intelligent people the power to control me than millions of commoners of low intelligence.   It's why China's attempt at communism quickly descended into authoritarianism.    I don't like using other counties as a benchmark. China has it's own issues from a historical point of view.   Who will watch the watchers?   The watchers will watch themselves. As I said there would be brutal punishment waiting fo the moment corruption occurs."

I don't know when reddit jumped the shark on this and decided the word discriminate could only be used negatively, and only about race, but the word simply means to make a distinction, and that's exactly what you're doing.

Better give 3 intelligent people the power to control me than millions of commoners of low intelligence   I don't like to incite Godwin's law, but Hitler was a very intelligent and very capable person. He led his country to extreme eminence, and could have conceivably conquered the entire world. Living in his country probably would have been pretty great... if you are aryan. If you aren't, the the heel of his boot would be hard and swift.   Do not mistake intelligence for morality. The Unabomber was a meticulously intelligent person and he killed tens of people to spread his message. Lawyers are intelligent and half of them exploit the misfortune of others. CEOs are intelligent but will not hesitate to fire thousands of people to improve the next quarterly statement.   All people hunger for their own self interest. Intelligent people are merely better at achieving it.    I don't like using other counties as a benchmark   It is foolish not to learn from the mistakes of others.

Our justice system and the laws that control it come from the government. People in control would make the intelligent decision and make laws allowing their behaviors.

It just so happened that the people who designed the test aligned it with their political beliefs.    Again you are putting words in my mouth and purposeful not understanding? This test is no political alighted nor is words contain subjective political ideologies. This test encourages people from different spectrum of politics to come together in a rational and civil way to conduct their policy. That is the whole point? If those 4 people succeeded 2 of them could be socialist the other 2 could be Anarchist, they will not be politically aligned, they are encouraged to work for and find a suitable representative.   I don't like to incite Godwin's law, but Hitler was a very intelligent and very capable person.    You are? Did he succeed my test, he would fail based on the tolerance criteria I mentioned? I knew people like you would use monsters from history who were intolerant.   Do not mistake intelligence for morality.   I'm not, remember most good people are intelligent, most moral people are intelligent, most ethical people are integument, you need intelligence to be moral, ethical and good. Dumb people like Hitler is why they are destined to fail the test and had over the power to a suitable person, right now in my test he would be going to a liberal arts college.   All people hunger for their own self interest. Intelligent people are merely better at achieving it.    That is the kind of determination I need. Any mistakes , lies, deceit and corruption would be met with swift and brutal punishment.   It is foolish not to learn from the mistakes of others.    That wasn't the point, people are quick to bring and demonize other countries and use it as benchmark.   That's going great for the U.S. government's blatant overrunning of the fourth amendment, isn't it?   Is the U.S. government implementing my idea? In fact just remember that one day you will die and the world will keep spinning and injustice will run around the world. Also note that the police department don't hire intelligent people. Let's get back to the voters instead of the policies.   Who would enforce that punishment?   That is another thing, I would preferably have a non-profit ionization taking  notes on politicians and keeping a record of them. Something akin to internal affairs whose sole job is to track politicians. Since a huge segment of the population are not going to vote, the punishment of politicians must increase thousand times, in fact I think we are insensitive since we allow trump and all these people to spew hatred and lies go to politifact and check up. I would prefer if they were killed, they just make me vomit.   Our justice system and the laws that control it come from the government. People in control would make the intelligent decision and make laws allowing their behaviors.    Wrong! Where did you get that from? You are putting the current American government as an analogy to mine.   I ask you again: who will stop the people in power from genociding an entire group of people?   Those people would have failed the exam, as noted above in the criteria.   Who will stop the government from dismantling its restraints? Who will watch the watchers?   I fully trust and obey the government once they implement these ideas, and since they don't I still obey and them. Who is stopping America from doing all these evil acts they do around the world with C.IA. blacksites? You are so emotionally fueled, you need to calm down and just focus on the voting rights."

If people with a basic education are better at electing officials than people without one, then people with very advanced educations might also be better at electing officials than people with basic educations. Why not just have the smartest or best educated person make all of the decisions for a country?  Think of it another way. Reimagine your group B as a group of very intelligent people that includes yourself. These people are extremely intelligent. They all posses IQ scores between two and three standard deviations above the mean. They read the news, are engaged with politics, and have a university level education.

The selection criteria that decides who is most fit to make decisions is also easy to game. You list ""tolerance towards others"" as a criteria. I agree that this is an important quality in decision makers, but many intelligent people would not. In fact, there are many intelligent people that would think you omitted several important criteria.  It is fundamentally important to your system that we agree on how to chose decision makers, however reasonable people might disagree.  Furthermore, people might propose criteria in a way that is self serving. I strongly suspect that you would not have posted this question if you thought you would be disenfranchised in this scenario. Even if we could agree on some objectively true metrics to decide who should retain the vote, we lose an important quality of representative government. Namely, we lose its representativeness. Your group A is very likely to enact laws to their benefit at the majorities expense. This does not even require bad intent.

Advanced implies specific and experiences dedication in certain fields. Those are rare next to Basic, that is why I chose the word basic, because it is the minimum requirement. I set the bar right there. Basic Mathematics is enough not Linear Algebra.   Why not just have the smartest or best educated person make all of the decisions for a country?

I see no flaw in my reasoning hence I'm standing behind it.   You want to ""treat low intelligence people as children,"" yet there is no way to determine a person's intelligence.   As I said we are labeling people who have succeed the examination intelligence. So the definition of intelligence will be changed. Or else we are going to look for a word to replace it.

TrueAskReddit,3crkmu,bleahdeebleah,3,Fri Jul 10 11:02:26 2015 UTC,"The following is an answer to a different question than what you ask. However, I believe the solution is not to ignore the unintelligent, because binary distinctions have a lot of bad things going for them:    the boundary is arbitrary; deciding whether a person should be on one side of the boundary or the other is prone to abuse;  it defines two groups, and we don't have a good record getting along with people in other groups.   I believe the solution, instead, is a system that someone once described as Structural Deep Democracy. What this person proposed is to use a similar algorithm to PageRank - the algorithm which Google's founders originally patented for cataloguing web pages for searching - to analyze a graph of people's recommendations of each other.  The graph we study can consist of all people regardless of age and ability; there are no arbitrary cutoffs as to who can participate. Everyone is queried as to names of other people whose judgment they trust and recommend, and the graph of these recommendations is studied to find the most central people.  The most central people in this graph, then, are those that society trusts the most. Find the top 1,000, and have them nominate and elect among themselves a government."

A source's reputation matters a lot.  Does Gawker occasionally put out good material?  Yeah.  They broke the Te'o story.  Would I take a Gawker source seriously if I found it on my own?  No, because they do a lot of tabloid crap and care more about pageviews than accurate information. Look at what kinds of coverage a source usually gives.  What kinds of people are its primary reading audience?  I stopped giving attention to NPR after realizing that it writes articles aimed mostly at liberal, hipstery, Portlandia types in their 20s.  If I had to see one more article about gay millennial bicyclist weightlifters who are vegan and recycle, I would have screamed. I ignore science reporting that doesn't link to the journal article it's talking about.  Most journalists go off of the university's sensationalized announcement, which is probably written by some PR person instead of the actual scientists involved.

That myth is that ""it is possible to change people's minds on socially divisive issues such as gay marriage, via direct contact from affected parties"". Academic integrity? Petty squabbling about a problem with no solution that misses the point. The fact that he had to fabricate results shows the myth, he had no support for it in reality.  There is no virtue in boredom.

We're in a technological time & place where the exceptionally narcissistic are able to both fully indulge their tendencies and overwhelm or dominate other conversations or activities that ""outsiders"" use to observe millennial culture.    Like, take Facebook, widely seen as the absolute zenith of millennial narcissism.  Most folks have a hundred - three hundred ""friends"" and yet pretty much everyone's news feed is or has been dominated by a few particularly self-absorbed and share-happy friends.  FB changes their algorithm to subvert this even, but I still see that loads of people I'm tight with never post anything at all, while a few people are making ten to twenty posts a day.    But to an old person on facebook - all they see is the self-absorbed excesses of the millennials dominating their feed, while they forget about or don't notice the relative silence from a whole bunch of other millennials they probably also have on their list.

All the best analyses (including the UN) predict that the population will peak some time mid-century around 9-10 billion and then start falling indefinitely.  Population growth for several decades now has been driven by people dying later as much as by actual births.  Basically everywhere on Earth, people live better now than they did 50 years ago when the population was half the size. There is a strong correlation between increased population and increased quality of life for everyone.

The UN study has disproved the old theory that the population will peak at 9 billion mid 21st century, claiming that the population will reach 9.6-12.3 billion by 2100. Just found an [article](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/18/world-population-new-study-11bn-2100] by the head of Environment at Bloomberg, Damian Carrington, breaking down this studies implications.   85% of the world's population doesn't live in developed countries, and if we continue focusing on bringing everyone into this modern age, then even the destructive amount of resources we can't sustainable harvest today will increase at incredible rates. We are failing today with just the few people using all the resources, think of all the people that live on nothing, if we do our job and increase their standard of living, then those billions will need their share of commodities. Imagine the mining, the cotton, and the gas required! Instead of scaling up, huge amounts of issues and risk could be solved by actively scaling down. We do this by educating people on contraception and removing them from situations that require them to maintain large families. Even in the developed world, contraception education remains important; in 2011 49% of pregnancies in the USA were unintentional, and only 38% of which were aborted. That leaves us with 31% or 1/3 of total US births beginning with accidental pregnancies.   Caribbean (58%), South America (64%) and southern Africa (59%) each had accidental pregnancies of 58%, 64%, and 59%, respectively. With the average abortion rate of 53% in developing regions, the amount of population prevention that could happen just from stopping already unwanted babies, could cut the population, again, by 30%. The world average for births caused by these unplanned pregnancies fares better, however, with a 20% rate. All this found through a 1995 - 2008 dataset.  In all population remains a problem because it causes problems that are easier solved by just keeping the population to a more manageable size.

I can't argue that we won't invent anything, and I think people will always survive, but at what cost could it come? Some of your examples had larger impacts than others, running out of animals most likely caused some starvation, and large enough farming wasn't invented overnight. That was a huge consequence that could have been avoided... if the population was kept in check with the animal populations. Other limitations provided no threat, such as running out of whale oil. Other fuel sources were available before that, and it was only an inconvenience.   No guarantee has been made that 7+ billion humans will perpetually live on Earth, and no past situations support this scale. A basic understanding of life, is that lifeforms multiply until they reach a resource cap and the population plummets until it can stabilize with the resources remaining. It probably won't come down to an apocalyptic human ending though, maybe our way of life will become shattered. I'd like to remain in my current time though, rather than resorting to an unwanted lifestyle.  Actually, there have been countless civilizations that died out. From ancient to recent, peoples have been growing and ending. This belief that we always find a way originates from the string of people that has brought us to this moment, but along the way, they luckily survived terrible events where others didn't. Until the modern age, peoples have been separated. If one empire crashed, others were still alive, but now, we are all intrinsically connected. Even modern greece with their relatively small economy became a large burden and disaster to europe's economy, even with all the effort to keep it afloat.   So why force ourselves into a scenario where we must come up with an invention to save ourselves when we know the problem and the answer. Let's reach that same technological advancement at our own accord without some unnecessary risks, such as lives. Let's not did the hole deeper when the latter is still tall enough.

Pursuing absolute certainty about things that cannot be certain is a waste of irreplaceable time and effort that could be spent on actual problems.   A basic understanding of life, is that lifeforms multiply until they reach a resource cap   Humans are not single-celled organisms. Our birth rates are already at replacement or lower in most of the world - voluntarily. Applying an analysis method for primitive lifeforms to populations of thinking people doesn't make sense.   If one empire crashed, others were still alive   If one empire crashed, it was still alive. An empire falling apart is just a political change. Sometimes people die in the process, but it's not like everyone in the Roman Empire died in 476. It just broke into smaller states. Global overpopulation disaster can't be compared to political shifts; they're entirely different events.   So why force ourselves into a scenario where we must come up with an invention to save ourselves when we know the problem and the answer.   Because there is no problem, and if there was, there would be no ""answer"" that wasn't a road straight to hellish tyranny. There is no humanitarian way to ""keep the population low"" besides raising living standards until people choose to have less kids - and that's what we're already doing, and it's already working.

TrueAskReddit,3cg54v,heartbeats,5,Wed Jul 8 01:29:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that at well over 7 billion people, we humans and our domesticated livestock and pets make up over 97% of the world's terrestrial vertebrate biomass. By 9 to 10 billion (Africa alone is expected to grow from 1.2 billion today to 2 billion by 2050 and 3 billion by 2100) we and our meat and our toys will easily make up 99%. And many more species will be extinct in order to make room for us.  The world's major fisheries are facing collapse or have already collapsed. Many major aquifers in breadbasket areas like India, Northern China, California, Australia, the American Midwest, are seeing remaining draws measured in a few decades, with pockets already switched to dry land farming. Mining of several crucial minerals increasingly means poorer grades, more remote locations, more costly and environmentally damaging extraction.  If a 22-year-old today has lived through the extraction of more than half of all the petroleum ever pumped out of the ground in all of human history, but the last major oil field discoveries were in the 1960s... There is going to be a problem with scarce cheap-to-extract-and-refine fuel in the next couple of decades.  So what if we switch to coal when oil becomes scarcer and more expensive - which is what the 90% of the world's current plants under construction or in planning are planning to burn? Already, every year, we put more carbon into the atmosphere and oceans - equivalent to an entire Amazon rainforest every ten years. Never mind the real and unstoppable juggernaut of climate change, which has already started chugging out of the station. Ocean acidification is already causing problems for shelled creatures at the bottom of marine food chains, reverberating upwards. This will collapse ocean life as we know it.  This ""slowing"" of population growth that you extoll is in reality a frantic race against the exponentially growing consequences of resource depletion and climate change. Even at over 7 billion people today, we are not just eating into the new growth of our renewable resources (the interest), we are eating into the the base resources (the capital). Slowly growing in population still means massive daily extraction and consumption and waste disposal for the 7 billion plus alive today.  This is not sustainable. By the time we reach 9 to 10 billion people the extraction, consumption, and waste will be at a greater pace. Even if we plateau or slope gently downwards in population, the devastation will be in all likelihood too great to recover from in mankind's timeline."
TrueAskReddit,3cg54v,hillsfar,5,Wed Jul 8 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"Paul Ehrlich, is that you?  ""Terrestrial vertebrate biomass"" is a rather specific and artificial category to focus so much on. This suggests an analysis around carefully-chosen data points designed to reach a predetermined result. The truth is, unless you hunt wild animals for your food, the amount of non-human non-farm-animal terrestrial vertebrate biomass is irrelevant.  Fish prices aren't rising, particularly. We're having no trouble replacing wild fish with farmed fish. There is not and will not be a fish shortage, simply a restructuring of the production method - the same way we went from hunting to farming animal meat 10,000 years ago.  The amount of petroleum ever pumped out of the ground in history is irrelevant; what matters is how much is left in the ground. Again, it's an artifical comparison of carefully-chosen data point designed to try to emphasize a pre-determined result. After all, any 22-year-old at any time during several decades starting in the later 19th century would also have lived through ""the extraction of more than half of all the petroleum ever pumped out of the ground in all of human history"".  Major oil fields continue to be discovered and newly exploited (e.g. shale oil in North America). Oil extraction tech gets better all the time, opening up new sources. And our economy gets better and better at making stuff with less energy per dollar of output (""energy intensity"" has fallen since the 70's).  The solution to the problems with coal power is modern nuclear power, or solar. Both are making technical leaps and bounds. Solar now provides 1% of global power and is growing very fast. It's an obvious candidate to power the electric autocars we'll all have 20 years from now.  As for your final summary, it just doesn't bear out in the evidence if you don't carefully select data points to create a misleading, predetermined result. People have been panicking about this exact thing just like you are since the 60's and continue to be dead wrong.

It's almost as if people are incapable of understanding that the resources available to us are finite, and that even without necessarily adding more billions of people just sustaining how large of a population we have by itself is not feasible in the long term. This chart will help illustrate this point.  Not only the amount of resources, but the availability/production based on our current models. A quick example with food; Soil erosion and degradation and the loss of arable land is not insignificant, in fact it's pretty important and almost never considered. You can try to argue that farmers just need to diversify their crops but the economics of that are not going to allow it. People aren't going to think long term, they never do. Future generations can suck it because I need profits now. Which is fine for the next couple years. But 20 years from now? 50? You will argue that yields increase, but they do this by abusing the land to the point of it no longer being productive, through which we lose apx. 10 million hectares of arable land per year.

We could easily support a larger population if we'd get rid of the waste and optimize production and distribution.   But more importantly, the problem of population growth isn't universal. We don't have a population growth problem in the western world. Or we do, but it's not a problem of there being too many of us. The parts of the world that experience significant population growth also have high child mortality and weak economies. That's the problem. But there's a solution, and it's not even very complicated.  Listen to Hans Rosling's many talks. He's got a number of TED Talks and a number of other appearances on YouTube. Another poster already posted a one-hour talk of his. Here's a shorter one that also addresses population growth.

Stable and healthy foundations upon which people can build a successful life don't exist in a lot of places, for billions of people, so there's great suffering as a result. That's the overpopulation problem. We have yet to figure out how to create a modern, industrial or post-industrial planet. Because of that, we are looking at not enough resources and services for the amount of people we have, which is overpopulation.   So, yes, there is a problem with overpopulation. We cannot support the population we have adequately."

The problem is ultimately infrastructure, which is a distribution problem. You can't distribute those things if the vast majority of a group don't have the education and culture that promote those things. If you could instantly educate people and change their culture then you would have the means to build the necessary infrastructure."
TrueAskReddit,3cg54v,Willravel,4,Tue Jul 7 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think the problem is culture. There's no culture which prefers dirty water or a lack of food. The problem is that the ""haves"" lack the will to aid the ""have-nots"" a lot of the time, and even have a vested interest in exporting what's tantamount to serfdom to the developing world, exploiting them for cheap labor and their resources. When combined with booming populations in the developing world, this means less money flowing in their economy, more reliance on other countries for economic success, and a cost of independence and self-reliance, which result in extreme poverty and few avenues to deal with it.   Getting this back to overpopulation, though, if the world had 5 billion less people, the infrastructure could exist to provide for all basic needs. The problem is that meeting needs hasn't caught up to population, which I interpret as overpopulation: for myriad reasons we can't properly provide for everyone, we can only provide for some.   The solution implied, however, is not less population. I think that's important. The solution to overpopulation is to reframe how we think about humanity. We're not countries and economies in competition, we're a species struggling for a good existence. Exploitation of the developing world is like stealing from your brother's first helpings because you want a third helping."

But if the population grows at its current rate, there will be a point where one planet is not enough, no way, no how. The more people there are reproducing, likely the sooner that will be. We can't say that things are fine now and shrug off the problem.

For starters, if we ever go to war, we'll be throwing bodies against bodies and the side with the most bodies wins. As of right now, a ground-war with China would most likely be a loss for the U.S.   But the real threat is, of course, more subtle: economic competition. GDP scales with population, and international political power scales with GDP. If our population even stagnates while the rest of the world's rises, we will cease to be an economic leader.  Any population-control measure must either be applied unilaterally across the globe, or must require political and economic sacrifices on the part of the particular actors."

You bring up China, yet China itself has implemented the most draconian policies toward birthrate in modern times, and somehow they do this with no regard for your supposed national security risk.    Secondly, a ground war with China has literally zero chance of occurring against anyone an ocean away.  The logistics involved are nearly insurmountable if they had the capabilities in the first place. Third, a ground war with china would include them getting royally butt fucked by the technology of the United States.    Additionally, economic competition is going to come down to robots doing work, not humans.  The cost for labor is going to continue to go down while productivity will increase into the foreseeable future.  A Zero population growth may very well be a strategic advancement in that regard.  Being an economic leader has little to do with people, and more to do with output, and adding more humans is having less and less of an impact on output the more technology develops.  To say that population control measures have to be applied unilaterally to work with ""sacrifices"" is at best misinformed, and more generally sounds like an opinion coming from someones ass."

This is true in much of the world. Japan won't have a larger population in 100 years, they'll have a smaller population. Much smaller... they're saying it will halve in that time period.  South Korea is the same, most of the developed east Asian nations are the same. China's one child policy has changed things for the worse... even when it's relaxed, most Chinese don't seem eager to have larger families.  Europe is like this as well.

But there are others.  The big one that comes to my mind is phosphorus. We use it all the time in fertilizers. Eventually it gets washed into streams and diluted into the ocean. What do we do when we run out of compounds with phosphorus in the future?  Lithium is gaining use in batteries and helium is used often in medical equipment. With more old people and more people with all sorts of electronic gadgets, where do we get the resources for them?  Say we get ourselves off of oil--though that doesn't seem feasible in the next century. Where do we get all of the petrochemical supplies?  Many places are running out of clean drinking water. Desalinization is energy intensive. How do we deal with that?  At some point, the people who are thinking about these problems, they wonder ""what would be the maximum number of people that could be on Earth wherein all of these problems could be taken care of due to modern technology.""

And yet in the developing world, countries are scrambling for ways to achieve higher birth rates. So it's not as simple as ""is it a problem or is it not?"""

I mean, on paper it's about maximizing wealth, but look at how wealth is defined in the context of capitalism: food, shelter, and the other means of reproduction.   This was great when there were barely any people on Earth, but eventually Europe became jam-packed and had to overflow into the New World and the Third World. Then, in the Cold War, when the West (capitalists) stood against the East (socialists), the West eventually overflowed into the East. China and Russia now have their own brands of capitalism.  The problem this time around is that we don't have anywhere to 'overflow' to; we can't quite colonize planets. The only solution is to cut back on the whole 'capitalism' thing, in either of these ways:  1) by establishing socialism. Ofc, it would have to be on a global scale; localized socialism fails, as seen in any tribal community that's been stamped out by an industrialized nation. PS: the USSR's Communist Party already tried this and it failed.  2) by leaning toward socialist tendencies. This will always require sacrifice, and will probably not have a tangible, measurable effect. It will require a leap of faith on the part of the individual.

Protecting American economic interests? Justified. Protecting American geo-political influence? Probably justified. Protecting human rights and spreading democracy? Maybe justified (harder to defend today, but hindsight is 20/20, many political thinkers in 2003 honestly thought reforming Iraq's political system would work).   No WMDs   There were no WMDs; not in the way they were being discussed (see next paragraph). The intelligence was bad, either because of a conspiracy or just because people got their facts wrong. Somewhere along the line, false information became accepted as fact. To be fair to Bush and Rumsfeld they did not necessarily know that they were acting on bad information.  That being said, there technically were WMDs. Technically, I can make a WMD in my garage. WMDs can include anything involving poison or disease.   perfectly legal   OP, what do you mean by ""legal""? As far as I know the US Congress has never passed a law saying you can't invade countries if they don't have WMDs.   Do you mean by international law? Because that exists, but it's fairly non-binding, as there are few methods for enforcing it"
TrueAskReddit,3cdtbi,Ironhorn,21,Tue Jul 7 09:00:55 2015 UTC,"The legality part comes from security council resolution 1441. The resolution gave Iraq one last chance to comply with an earlier resolution that among other things forbade Iraq from importing or producing certain kinds of weapons (not only WMDs). It was understood that breaking this would probably lead to a war, because that was really the only way to enforce it.  Iraq agreed to the resolution and claimed to be implementing it, but they actually did not. An excerpt from the lengthy wikipedia section:   Iraq continued to fail to account for substantial chemical and biological stockpiles which UNMOVIC inspectors had confirmed as existing as late as 1998. Iraq claimed that it had disposed of its anthrax stockpiles at a specific site, but UNMOVIC found this impossible to confirm since Iraq had not allowed the destruction to be witnessed by inspectors as required by the pertinent Resolutions. Chemical testing done at the site was unable to show that any anthrax had been destroyed there.  Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei presented several reports to the UN detailing Iraq's level of compliance with Resolution 1441.[7][8][9] On 27 January 2003 Chief UN Weapons Inspector Blix addressed the UN Security Council and stated ""Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance – not even today – of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.""[10] Blix went on to state that the Iraqi regime had allegedly misplaced ""1,000 tonnes"" of VX nerve agent—one of the most toxic ever developed.[7]   This failure to comply with the resolution made the US want to go to war. Preferably they wanted a new resolution that explicitly allowed an invasion but they could not get sufficient support in the security council, especially as France said they'd veto. At this point the US chose to go to war anyway, arguing that the breech of resolution 1441 was enough and that Iraq had been given more than enough time to voluntarily implement it.  So the final conclusion is that it was probably legal and maybe justified, based on the information available at the time. Even if Iraq did not actually have any chemical weapons, there were very good reasons to believe they did. Iraq could probably have proven quite easily that they did not have such weapons, but they chose to hide things and to be as defiant as they could."

Chapter I Article 2 of the UN Charter (a foundational document of international law if there ever was one) states quite clearly:   All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state   The US completely ignored this, and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said the war was illegal.

They were not the WMDs(specifically, the nuclear and biological programs) that were used to sell the war.  Lot of chlorine and mustard gas, but you can make those with household goods, and Hussein had just buried the stuff in the desert.  His general staff thought that the buried WMDs were actually related to the programs the US was talking up, and Saddam encouraged that belief(as part of a deterrence campaign against Iran).

But I think I was depressed and suicidal because I wanted to believe my life would matter after I died, and I think that when I realized that after I died, I'd never know or care if my life mattered, that helped 'pop the bubble' for me. I think after death there is a blissful nothingness, but as a result, I can live my life in peace.)

So I thought long and hard about how to make things look like an accident.  From various power tool accidents, etc.  I even considered taking up a hobby like building bookshelves and similar things so that I could cut my leg with a power saw and make a show of trying to reach my phone, which I would have laid on top of something just out of reach.  I was never worried about what would happen to me if I died, it was always about how others would react.  Like, I wouldn't want my mom to feel like she failed; it's not her fault that I'm broken."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,ZanSquid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:49:58 2015 UTC,"For me, at least, it's always been an equation to minimise suffering between myself and my loved ones. The reduction in suffering from me killing myself would be outweighed by the increase in suffering to those who loved me. However, if I were to die in an accident, net suffering would most likely be reduced. It's just a balancing act."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,mmmmdonut,5,Wed Jul 8 05:01:50 2015 UTC,"Would the release you think death provides make up for the lifelong anguish you would inflict on the ones who love you? It's considered selfish because of the pain it causes to those who love you, not because you yourself feel pain."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,MmmmPingas,16,Mon Jul 6 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"If a suicidal individual comes to terms with the fact they wish to die, the people who are left behind should also make the decision to accept that. It's not fair to make the suicidal person responsible for maintaining the livelihood of people around them by not self destructing, no more than you should expect the person to make sure everybody around them is fed, watered, clothed, and sheltered."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,mmmmdonut,11,Tue Jul 7 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"And in a world where people don't truly connect that would work really well. But we do live in a world where people connect, where people love each other. And the people left behind don't get the choice or have a say in the decision, they're forced into that grief. That's why it's considered a selfish act. I don't necessarily agree that it should have that connotation, but you can't deny that part of the act is selfishly driven. The only reason I haven't done it is because my mom is still alive and it would crush her, I'm not that selfish. Suicide is something that should never be mistaken as a good or noble thing no matter how depressed the person is or how clearly they've 'come to terms' with the fact they want to die because, ultimately, suicide is a tragedy."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,autopornbot,5,Tue Jul 7 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"If I knew my closest and most loved friend/relative felt like I do and had tried everything I have tried to overcome it, I would want them to commit suicide and end their suffering. I would help them if they asked. Of course I would try to help them beat depression first, but if it is like mine incurable, I would help them die and be free of it. I would also help someone I loved die if they had incurable cancer that left them with only pain.   The way we refuse to let people die, and force them to stay alive no matter how much they suffer, that is the selfishness. As a teenager, I had to watch my grandmother deteriorate in dementia for 8 years. She also had megasophagus or something where she couldn't swallow. She basically withered away and died an absolutely horrifying death that took forever. Fuck that shit. No one deserves to be trapped in a life that has no joy and is full of only pain."

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,autopornbot,3,Tue Jul 7 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"So someone should endure a life of absolute misery just so the people who love him wouldn't have to be sad for a little while?

No. My depression makes it so that most mornings, I have to physically force myself out of the bed. It is constant and every day. Death doesn't cause life stopping pain and suffering every day of your life. Depression does.   To me, it comes down to constant, life-long suffering for the person with depression versus temporary suffering as the result of a death.  I've always thought of it as if the person with depression is starving to death and comes across a cracker. Someone else approaches and is a bit hungry and says ""Give me that cracker."" They would rather the person with depression keep suffering forever in order to prevent some pain for them."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,soidboerk,2,Tue Jul 7 09:10:07 2015 UTC,"Is it selfish to want someone to stay alive even though he is constantly in pain? why can someone that is terminally ill die and someone that is chronically ill till he dies not allowed to? In the end everyone dies sooner or later and there is always someone that will feel the pain of loosing someone close. So wouldn't it be better to solve someones own misery instead of postponing someone elses misery? There is a difference between selfishness and choosing the objectively less pain creating solution.

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,BeowulfShatner,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:02 2015 UTC,What is worse though?  The pain of one or the pain of many?  I think that's where that argument breaks down.
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,lnh92,7,Tue Jul 7 08:58:11 2015 UTC,"My main point is that the pain for the suicidal and depressed is constant and won't go away. While the pain for someone who died is very real and strong, people move on. It's been 11 years since my grandpa died, and I'm no longer sad about it. I miss him, but I'm not constantly sad. I've suffered from depression and that's something that won't go away."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Elendira,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd agree, but you have to keep in mind the ""quantity"" of pain, if you will. Grief fades over time. It's doubtful that depressed people can maintain a lot of bonds with others anyway, so those affected by the suicide are limited. Having to live without any hope of joy is a torment. A little grief is a small price compared to that hell. I would think that anyone that truly cared about the suicidal person would be glad that they no longer had to suffer."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Sacrix,3,Tue Jul 7 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"People who have depression from a fresh romantic breakup, failed the final exam, was embarrassed by their crush shouldn't be encouraged to kill themselves off the back because most likely they can overcome their depression with therapy and our best friend Father Time.   To be fair, terminology becomes important at that point as well. A breakup usually doesn't cause clinical depression (it can, certainly if it's one among many circumstances going badly for that person). Being depressed in the sense of feeling bad, and being depressed in the sense of wanting to quit life and seeing no hope for the future, are very, very different things."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,jangleberry112,2,Tue Jul 7 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"What you said, about nobody asking to be born into this world so why should we force them to stay, resounds so strongly with me. I have suffered major depressive disorder since I was very young, 8 or 9. I have attempted suicide a few times. I have been in therapy for years, and I have been on goodness knows how many different kinds of medication, and the best I can hope for these days is a day where I'm NOT curled into a ball sobbing.  I've done all of the recommended, exercise, get outdoors, try to find a fulfilling career. I have a husband and a house and a dog and cats, refuse to have children (both because I don't want to pass on my disorder and I couldn't care for them properly with mine) and yet still, the best I can hope for is a day where I don't go to bed dreaming of someone pressing a gun to my brainstem and just ending it.  It's like I tell my doctors, I'm not suicidal, I just never asked to have existed in the first place, and now I'm forced to take responsibility for my own existence. I'm forced to try and find a job in a miserable economy, forced to find the money and means to feed and clothe myself, pay my taxes and mortgage. I never asked for this.  If there was a wild animal whose only inclination was towards self-destruction, would we not let that animal destroy itself and/or aid it?"
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,scartol,4,Tue Jul 7 10:52:28 2015 UTC,"I'll be the lone dissenting voice here and say that I disagree. I don't believe severely depressed people should be allowed to kill themselves, but not because it's ""selfish"". (I agree with you that forcing someone to continue living a life of pure pain is also selfish.)  My reason, quite simply, is this: Things change. They don't always change, and they certainly don't change quickly. But the woman in the article is 24, and that's pretty young. Sounds like she had a wretched childhood. I can't help thinking that she's suffering from the weight of those miserable experiences, and that if she experienced a total change of life -- new continent, new routines, new life -- then maybe after a few years she could find some glimmers of hope. If that's possible, then suicide now would be unfair to the person she could be, and joie de vivre she might one day experience.  I don't want to be Pollyanna about this; I know it's easy for me to say, having only experienced minor and fleeting forms of depression. But we've all gone through changes in our lives, right? I've known people who have struggled with horrible depression and suicide attempts. (I've also lost good friends to suicide, so this is personal for me on both sides.) Those who have stepped back from the brink eventually gave thanks for not following through. (Five-Years-From-Now-Tim is glad that Five-Years-Ago-Tim didn't take the ultimate drastic step.)  I have two caveats for my position:   I definitely believe in allowing people (esp. the terminally ill) to die with dignity, so they don't have to use some arcane and uncertain and potentially painful method of pills or gunshots or what have you. This obviously complicates things. I know most people don't have the ability to just pick up and move to another continent. But couldn't we as a society do something about that? (As Camus says in The Myth of Sisyphus: ""There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."") Maybe create a fund to help those in desperate situations change their environs? I find it so sad that we pretend like there are only two options: Suck it up, or end it all."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,iLoveGloop,4,Tue Jul 7 12:28:38 2015 UTC,"But Five-Years-From-Now-Tim won't be here to miss out on the small possibility of some glimmer of hope, if he does commit suicide.

So doesn't 2010Tim owe it to 2015Tim to hang on?   His immense suffering is not just a future possibility though, it is a present and all consuming hell. And there is a way out of it, in the present.   But that's not the only way out. While it's true that suicide will end Tim's suffering, he cannot know that the suffering won't end through other means. Again, the young lady in the OP has only had about five years of adulthood. That's a lot of pain and suffering, but many many things can change in another five years."

No, 2015Tim doesn't exist, so nobody owes him anything. 2010Tim does exist and he must do what's best for him. I find this argument a little like anti-abortion arguments, in that the mother should suffer in order to give a chance to a person that doesn't even exist yet.   But that's not the only way out.   So what if it's not the only way out? Does this invalidate it? Also, in many cases it is the only out and trying out other routes only prolongs the suffering.  Edit: sp"
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,EzDi,10,Tue Jul 7 13:22:21 2015 UTC,"Like many other people said, I agree that people have a right to die. If you don't have control over your own body (including its end) then what can you control?  Seeing no way out of your misery other than ending it all is often called selfish, but I would argue that forcing someone to continue to be ""miserable"" (not the right word; this is a misery you cannot understand if you have never been there) for 50 years because you love them or religious convictions is EVEN MORE selfish. Of course if I shared those religious convictions, I would believe forcing them to stay alive is asking them to be miserable for 50 years, but receive eternity in happiness (or similar), which is a good deal. The price is tiny in the big picture. But if they don't believe it, there is only YOU wronging them. And modern legal frameworks should not require a specific religious conviction in order to be just.  An argument could be made that society has invested in the individual and deserves to see a return. Some famous artists have been depressed and managed to channel that into great works, but I would argue that is the exception and not the rule. A chronically depressed person who has tried everything and will never be able to get out of bed will never give you that return.  So the argument could be modified to say you owe society (friends, family, school tax payers, etc) to prove this isn't a temporary issue and you have tried to fix it. Trained professionals can determine this and provide other help if warranted."

It doesn't mean that if you care about somebody you should not try to disuade them from committing suicide, but at the end of the day, it's their life and their decision and certainly the government should never force anyone to stay alive against their will or punish people for attempting to end their lives."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,stabinthedark_,29,Mon Jul 6 18:27:39 2015 UTC,I don't have an opinion yet on the matter but I will say that someone suffering from depression is not in their right mind. Depression is so miserable that one might prefer to die rather than suffer a lifetime from it yet many who wish to die find treatment and a life worth living.

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,ThisIsNotAnAlias,2,Mon Jul 6 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"At first, I wanted to talk about how an 'entry barrier' to suicide methods keeps the suicide rate lower - if there are proven methods to kill yourself readily available, suicide rates seem to be higher (see here).  But in that light, your proposal isn't that bad: Offering some kind of government sanctioned euthanasia after a mandatory period of treatment is offering a carrot to many people who think about suicide but haven't had an episode yet where they try to go through with it. I think there are lots of suicidal people who think a lot about their choice of method and minimizing damage to others (i.e. not having people witness their deaths or having to feel responsible for it, train conductors etc.). So people might more readily seek treatment if on the other side of it is a humane, painless (one can hope) death.  Tuning the bureaucracy to the point that only very few if ever any get to the point that they actually get killed is tantamount. But on the other hand you can't cheat (i.e. by heavily medicating people), which might turn people away from the official channels...   But the key to it all, which will solve many other problems as well, is overcoming prejudices concerning mental illness (no 1 reason for people to avoid treatment) and a much better coverage of psychotherapists."

Perhaps if they go through the state instead of just outright killing themselves there should be some mandatory counseling and a period of time in between to diagnose and attempt to treat them. Kind of like what they do with trangenders before making the change.   Yes, I agree. A depressed person should not have the final say in ""I want to die"" without--at the very least--being forced to explore other options before perhaps having a professional opinion.

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,TheVeryMask,4,Tue Jul 7 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Personal sovereignty. If you can choose to live or how to live, you can also choose not to.  There are many arguments here about sound mind and whether or not a depress'd state counts as sound. I haven't tried to quantitatively measure reasoning power, but I'd be willing to bet that whatever bar we set for personal sovereignty will be lower than most expect.  Because that's what it comes down to for me: your own life is within your field of sovereignty. If you can choose to live, then you can also choose not to. Further, the ability to determine what you do with your life must come after the ability to choose to live, especially if some of the open courses carry some personal risk such as a dangerous job or hobby. We can't just declare certain thoughts or desires off limits, nor say that you forfeit your sovereignty when you make a decision I don't approve of. Even if your low state and dark place are temporary circumstances, your decision in that moment is still yours.  I go back and forth about whether to make your estate liable for damages. On the one hand, we should treat suicide separately from any other damage you incur in the process because they aren't necessarily link'd. Jumping in front of a train is a dick thing to do because it requires cleanup and is horribly disruptive. It's not the train's fault, and you're inflicting costs on them they shouldn't bear responsibility for. On the other hand, charging the estate is functionally punishing your loved ones for losing someone, assuming you have some. The systems designer in me likes the disincentive this can pose as a discouragement from recklessness, but at least 1/3rd of suicides are spontaneous rather than premeditated, which is somewhat unfair. I'd ideally like to affect a cultural shift towards open discussion and psychological support, so that at the very least there would be some preparation in advance if the support doesn't lift the person from suicide.  I'm wary of giving someone else the power to end your life though, and however we implement this should include significant safeguards from abuse. Write all your laws as though you expect an evil totalitarian dictatorship and you may be able to avoid creating one. I don't want you to be able to get together with an evil doctor and off your spouse either. Implementation will require more thought.  I also extend this to the young, within limits. If you have a choice between a safe procedure for a young teen that will give poor quality of life and a risky one that can give better, then of course ""the kid says above all she wants to live"" should guide your decision. If that's so, then it should go the other way too. ""I want to be able to run, I'll take the chance"" is not differently reasonable from the first option. If the probability of the chance enters into the equation of whether you should take the teen's input, then you're only giving the choice if it agrees with you, which de facto ignores choice.  I am currently alive partly to serve others in the future, and so wouldn't choose to die now probably but not everyone is in my same position. If I had the option to prevent my own birth I would most likely take it, accepting the effects it would have on history. We are made to live long before we are able to decide if it's worth it, and whatever life you have was not wholly but at least partially inflict'd on you in the very act of your creation."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Anodynic,8,Tue Jul 7 05:10:05 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't believe you should allow anyone with a mental illness to do anything that could constitute harm against themselves or others. I struggled with depression (although, like others say, it really never goes away) and at certain points I did have suicidal thoughts. Thankfully I had a strong support system and they helped me through the worst part of it, and since then I've experienced so much more. I've traveled and laughed and tried new things and every second that I feel happy is a moment that I simultaneously enjoy being alive.  Granted that's just personal experience, however in numerous other examples (both controversial and not) I have seen mental illnesses encouraged to take permanent action to combat it/be ""happier"" and people end up regretting it.  For example (and if you are easily offended please do not read further, I am not ""oppressing"" anyone with my opinion, this is the only concise way I can think of to give a solid example) the way transsexuality is currently being treated supports my stance. If someone claims they have felt trapped in the wrong body/have gender dysphoria, they're bombarded with propaganda and urged to take drastic, life-changing action. From expensive hormone treatments to expensive therapy, doctor's visits and plastic surgeries for their nose, jaw, browbone, genital change, etc., it doesn't stop. Now there are many cases where people, a few years down the line, are trapped with crippling debt and inside a body that they can't EVER revert back to how they were prior. Sure, there are some people happy with their new lifestyle, however every day there are more and more ""regret"" stories that I am reading and I can't help but feel like the drastic action being encouraged is only causing harm.  Think of what'd happen if assisted suicide due to mental illnesses became legal. The system could easily be abused and quite frankly many lives that are likely to get better would never have the chance. When you are depressed, you're legitimately not thinking rationally or as normal. If every person I've known who had depression just killed themselves when they felt like the world was too much, there'd be so many missed weddings, vacations, happy experiences, children, you name it...  I'd say that most people would regret their decision however they'd be dead so they wouldn't be given the opportunity. Stop encouraging permanent solutions to temporary problems. The only perspective that seems to benefit from this are those in the position of Eugenicists or those who don't truly know what it is like to go through depression and the recovery process."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,slyweazal,11,Mon Jul 6 21:20:03 2015 UTC,"My gut says ""no""...but it's an interesting question and I know I'm not considering every variable.  I don't think people in a clinically depressive state are of sound mind to make such a drastic, permanent decision. Especially a decision with incomparable, wide-reaching consequences for many others (children, dependents, financial burden, etc.). That's why the phrase ""of sound mind"" is in so many legal documents. It matters.  If they still want to take their life AFTER they've come out of their depressive bout, I'd be more receptive to that..."

All people have the right to forgo their life, at any time, and for any reason they see fit.   Preventing someone from committing suicide, even if they may thank you later, even if they are not in their right peace of mind, is still the most unfair crime to commit against that person, because, in that moment, it now becomes your fault for everything that happens to that person. Every pain, anguish, and suffering of the mind, body, and soul now becomes your responsibility. And just as it is your responsibility for any human problems that they may experience, they similarly loose such responsibility. You've made that person a shell of agency, a failure of themselves and their own will.  So yeah, they should be allowed to kill themselves."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,artifex0,15,Tue Jul 7 06:11:19 2015 UTC,"All people have the right to forgo their life, at any time, and for any reason they see fit.   Consider the following situations:   A schizophrenic man who doesn't experience delusions while on medication is unable to obtain the medication for a period of time, and begins to believe that if he dies, he'll be resurrected as a god. A soldier behind enemy lines is informed of the end of the war, but doesn't believe the news, and attempts suicide to avoid capture. A cult member is manipulated into attempting suicide by a psychopath.   In all of those cases, the decision of the suicidal person is based on incorrect information- resulting from delusion, mistakes or manipulation.   While a person absolutely has the right to consent to die, consent requires an accurate understanding of the situation, and saving someone who hasn't consented to die isn't unethical.  All the people in the above examples should be saved for that reason, in my opinion.  Depression is often a temporary condition- it's something that can be treated with medication and which might fade on it's own given time.  However, it can at times be very difficult for a severely depressed person to recognize that- it's a condition that saps hope and can leave a person at times only able to conceive of the bleakest possible future.  A person suffering from severe depression might be able to make an informed decision to die if they've based that decision on the advice of medical professionals (as the Belgian woman presumably did), but if the decision is based only on their own expectations, I think it would be unlikely to represent informed consent.  If there is hope for a suicidal person that their condition prevents them from seeing, I think preventing that suicide would be the ethical option."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,TheVeryMask,3,Mon Jul 6 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"Stipulating ahead of time that within the scope of this discussion, it's possible for suicide to be the right choice.  Does that extend all the way? Because that seems to suggest that I should regret making the best decision available given the information I had, if that information was wrong, and the thing I should have done was the thing I thought was a bad idea at the time. If I think a child is afraid of clowns but loves ducks, when actually it's reverse, did I make the right call by giving a toy duck for a gift? You don't get to take credit for the facts being other than you thought, especially if that's out of your control.

That may be a point which could be argued, but all I'm arguing here is that to prevent those suicides wouldn't be unethical.  It's very possible for a person to make a completely reasonable decision free of any mistake which they nevertheless would prefer not to have made in hindsight.  For someone else to attempt to prevent such a decision might reasonably appear unethical to the person making the decision in the moment, but at the same time not unethical to an observer with more information, or to the decision-maker in hindsight.  To extend your illustration: if I, knowing that the child preferred clowns, surreptitiously switched out your gift, would I be doing you a disservice?  If you discovered the switch before giving the gift, you might reasonably think that I had, given the information available to you, but would it be unethical?  Is it more ethical to base my actions on my own understanding of what would benefit others, or on my understanding of the understanding of others?"

In the above examples, the decision-makers are making the wrong choice in the first sense, but not necessarily in the second sense.   What you should do in the case of the present is tell me I have it backwards   Frankly, that's an evasion.  We can't always present others with the evidence available to us- in those cases, we often have a moral imperative not to absolve ourselves of responsibility, but to accept that responsibility and act with consideration for the interests of others.

Correct my information if you think I've got it wrong, then correct my reasoning if you think that's wrong too which to be fair you are actually trying to do in this discussion, and I really appreciate it but don't make the decision for me. If I want to die, I should have the final say in the matter. Personal sovereignty. Further, I should be able to kill myself for any or no reason. Maybe I'm bored, or curious, or it's just a whim.

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,AF79,41,Tue Jul 7 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"I absolutely disagree.  Most suicides are relatively spontaneous. I know that sounds weird, especially seeing as how many suicide victims have suffered for a long time before that, but the actual decision to end it usually comes as a somewhat impulsive act.  In England, a lot of suicides used to be done by sticking your head in a gas oven and turn on the gas. It was a relatively quick and painless way to go, and it was always readily available. As a result it was very popular. The government decided to ban gas ovens, and the result was that the suicide rate went down by a third. Likewise, a suicide-prevention barrier was constructed on a bridge that was a popular spot to jump off of. People could have jumped from another bridge instead, or killed themselves in a million other ways. Instead the suicide rate in that area dropped by fifty percent.  Why is this relevant, you ask? Because a decision which, to that degree, can be shown to be a spur-of-the-moment decision should not be allowed to be made by someone of unsound mind. If someone who is in a state of clinical depression kills him- or herself, it's a tragedy that there was body there to stop them.  Also, I think that your argument about being responsible for their pain and suffering is hugely oversimplified. It can easily be turned around to say that if someone who is mentally ill decides to kill themselves - and you don't stop them - you are responsible for robbing them of the potentially good life they may have had.  As someone who has been fighting depression myself - and as a general student of psychology (although, to be fair, mostly cognitive- and neuropsychology) - I absolutely think that turning your back to someone of unsound mind trying to kill themselves is a serious crime."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Nimitz14,8,Tue Jul 7 06:35:33 2015 UTC,"It can easily be turned around to say that if someone who is mentally ill decides to kill themselves - and you don't stop them - you are responsible for robbing them of the potentially good life they may have had.   To quote Marcus Aurelius:   Were you to live three thousand years, [...] remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment; and furthermore that he can have no other life except the one he loses. This means that the longest life and the shortest amount to the same thing. For the passing minute is every man's possession, but what has once gone by is not ours. Our loss, therefore, is limited to that one fleeting instant, since no one can lose what is already past, nor yet what is still to come - for how can he be deprived of what he does not possess? So two things should be borne in mind. [...] Secondly, that when the longest- and the shortest-lived of us come to die, their loss is precisely equal. For the sole thing of which any man can be deprived is the present; since this is all he owns, and nobody can lose what is not his.   In the end I think it is wrong to force somebody to live until he is physically incapable of doing so. I can understand where you're coming from but I feel like your worries could be mitigated by introducing a mandatory waiting period etc."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,payik,2,Tue Jul 7 09:16:40 2015 UTC,"That's one possibility. Another possibility is that they use a way that isn't as easily proven to be a suicide instead.  People with depression are not ""of unsound mind""."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,AF79,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"As for your first point, that's a theoretical possibility. Statistically speaking, however, the difference in suicides in the examples I've linked to above is too large to realistically make that claim. In the bridge example, for instance, the drop in suicides was more or less the same as the amount of people who would have otherwise jumped from that bridge (documentation in the link right above it). They didn't even bother to migrate to a similar bridge a couple of miles down. The odds that all (or even most) of them chose a method of suicide that seemed like accidents or whatever is slim.  As for your second point, I've suffered from depression. Most of my decisions at the time were rational - although they were based in a world view that was somewhat distorted. If my depression had made me suicidal, however, I would very much argue that it had made me of unsound mind."

Who is of unsound mind? If a perfectly stable person tried to kill themselves because they feel that life isn't worth living what would you say?  Making suicides longer and more painful IS a way to prevent suicides, but is it something that we should look at in social policy? Is making the end of the lives of thousands of people who've suffered more inconvenient a viable option?  You do bring up a long of good points, and I respect that for some suicide is a spur of the moment decision, but the nature of that moment is debatable, because I can understand someone who ""snaps"" and realizes that life isn't worth living, and I understand that people should take a long time to understand the ramifications of what they might do. If we had more suicide advocacy in the public sphere I might even say that they should always take some time to think about their actions, but since so many people are geared and trained to PREVENT suicides instead of DISCUSSING them I personally feel that suicide should simply go unprevented."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,AF79,2,Mon Jul 6 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"As for your three paragraphs, here are my respective replies:  1) If anyone tries to kill themselves, I believe it is anyone's responsibility to try to save their lives. If that person is truly intent on killing themselves, they will find a way; if not, you have just saved a life. If someone is mentally ill, suicide attempts should be continuously prevented when possible, until they are no longer clinically and pathologically unstable.  2) Who said anything about making suicides more painful and full of suffering? Making it inconvenient is typically enough, and talking someone out of it can often be effective. Even if you need to fight to keep someone alive after they've taken an overdose of sleeping pills, or you need to cut the rope someone is trying to hang themselves with... yes, preventing their suicide is the right thing to do. If they shoot themselves in the head the next day, so be it.  3) I don't disagree with all of this; especially if people were more aware of the nature of suicides - particularly the dangers of suicidal impulses - we could save lives and/or help make sure that the ones who do take their lives, do it in a way that is thoroughly premeditated. That said, any suicide is a tragedy, in my opinion, whether 'well' chosen or not."

When does someone stop being ""productive""?   At all? When they die.   How do you measure ""productive potential""?   Reason.   Why should I care about how ""productive"" I'm being?   You should care about the productivity of others. Them adding to the overall well-being increases your well-being, ergo you have an inherent interest in their productivity. Them dying ends that, so unless them living is a big resource drain, you're better off with them alive.   How can you enforce your will on other people in claims that they need to be ""productive""?    Force.   What ""society"" are we claiming grants right to dying?   Whichever one the hypothetical agent is living in.   How can we declare your ""society"" to have ""incentive""?   Every person in society has an inherent interest in the productivity of others, as outlined above.   You didn't actually address anything that I said, so I hope I'm a little more direct with you than you are with me. I don't think you have a solid ground for ""ethics"", and unless you actually convince me that keeping someone in bondage, attached to an IV, and waiting them out until they don't kill themselves is a good thing for ""society"" then I'm just going to flat out call you a bullshitter.   No, of course not; that situation would be terrible. The point of that example was to demonstrate that your right to die can be taken away. Less extreme means (temporary physical restraint, etc.--most of the ones EDCs have currently) can restore a person to productivity.  I'm sorry my post wasn't very clear. Hopefully my clarification clears things up. I didn't address anything in your original post very directly, so I'll go ahead and address it better now. I read it as:   If we do not have the ability to die, we are slaves to our circumstances If we are slaves to our circumstances then we are hollow bodies that may live, but not experience. Therefore if we do not have the ability to die then we are hollow bodies (from 1 and 2) Our mortality defines our life Our ability to exert our will over mortality makes us human. If we are not human, then we are baseless animals, going through bodily processes without the power to enjoy them, and aging without the power to reflect. If you take away someone's ability to exert will over mortality, then you make them not human (from 5) If you make someone not human you force them to live without choice   My issue is nowhere in there did you give a reason why it's bad for me to do any of those things. Sure, it may suck for someone else, but at no point in your argument did you address why I should care."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,EmeraldEnd,4,Mon Jul 6 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"At all? When they die.   I meant does going to sleep stop being productive? Does lounging about for a day stop being productive? Is dumpster diving productive? But you seem to support this kind of warped utilitarianism that seems to say that the only rights people have are as far as they are useful, and that all people are fit to be thrown away as soon as they are not fit to aid other people's happiness.   Reason.   This is ambiguous as all hell, because I reason that people don't have a ""productive potential"". What now?   You should care about the productivity of others. Them adding to the overall well-being increases your well-being, ergo you have an inherent interest in their productivity. Them dying ends that, so unless them living is a big resource drain, you're better off with them alive.   I don't care about how productive other people are, and I don't care about how productive I am within your paradigm. I care about being able to feed myself and my family, and letting us have a reasonable standard of living. I really do not care how productive people, only as much as that the world economy doesn't collapse, which is held up by everyone pursuing their own individual interests.   Force.   I'm not questioning your methods, I'm questioning your morality. Now I see that you're not looking at this from a position that respects other people's opinions, but instead has this authoritarian control over the lives of people that doesn't serve to help with anything.   Every person in society has an inherent interest in the productivity of others, as outlined above.   You're ignoring the question. How can a society have incentive?   The point of that example was to demonstrate that your right to die can be taken away.   That's not how rights work. Rights are things that all people have that should be respected and understood to work. I'll do an uncontroversial one, ""the right to due process"" which is both outlined in the US bill of rights and the UN declaration of human rights which covers almost all of the world. I'm not saying that its impossible for someone to have an unfair trial, I'm saying that its an outrage of the highest magnitude for that right to be violated. Does that clarify what rights are?  As for that last bit I just have to say that it is in the interest of all people, an emotional interest, a ""productive interest"", because it would make people very ""unhappy"" that their rights could be violated so willy nilly. In order for you to be ""productive"" it is in your best interest to not violate anyone's inherent rights, because that would very heavily decrease your ""productivity"" and the ""productivity"" of those who found out about that.  You didn't define any of the terms I needed you to define, and you didn't attempt to convince me that your wicked ideal of utilitarianism to be, well, anything short of mass slavery, genocide, and self defeatist, so... yeah, I really have nothing to respond against."

There were no highs to go with his lows.  He was just flat out depressive, existing in a hell that I can't imagine (or don't want to).  In hindsight I realize it was the most humane thing for him and he should have done so sooner.   That said, a depressed person is fully capable of killing themselves should they so desire.

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,TheChance,2,Tue Jul 7 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"You know, I've suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, and this thread has me furious.  This question gets trotted out as a ""philosophical issue"" every once in a while, and my blood boils. It's a stupid question based on a stupid premise.  I have to assume that those of you advocating in favor fall into one of two categories:   Yourselves depressed (pleased to meet you!) Completely unfamiliar with depression and with no basis for comparison   Depression is a medical disorder resulting from a chemical imbalance in the brain. It can be treated to varying degrees. An individual patient's mileage may vary.  No patient is capable of ""consenting"" to suicide, any more than a 14-year-old is capable of consenting to sex. Yes, that kid is so horny it literally hurts, but that's just tough shit. Learn to masturbate.  People seem to be marginalizing the notion that a depressed person is not in their right mind, like it doesn't matter because they will never be in their right mind. Or else, why are we allowed to make all our own life decisions except this one?  Well, why is a 14-year-old allowed to make so many of their own decisions, but not that one, nor decisions about whether to attend school, nor to obtain a driver's license?  It's about competence. Whatever else may or may not be the case for an individual patient, nobody who is suffering from depression is competent to judge their worth, potential or quality of life against their suffering. The principal symptom of depression is a crippling lack of motivation. Second on the list is being oblivious to the world. You can't see the forest through the trees.  It doesn't matter how long I've been suffering. It doesn't matter how badly I just want my suffering to end. You can't trust me when I tell you that I will never be productive, never feel better, or that the destination is not worth the journey; you can't trust me, because I have no concept of what ""better"" looks like.  A severely depressed individual can't muster the nerve to change out of their bathrobe, brush their teeth, or make breakfast, let alone to go out into the world and have a life. Taking their self-judgments at face value is akin to believing the drunk who insists that the room is spinning. The room is not spinning, and your smashed friend will realize this when the vertigo begins to subside.  Well, imagine that you found a very drunk person with a gun to their head, intending to make the room stop spinning. Do you let them?  Of course not. Depression is no different, it's simply longer-lasting.  If a person in the depths of depression goes on to experience even one moment of real pleasure, however fleeting or insignificant, it will have been worth living the interim. There is no reason to believe that any person, by virtue of clinical depression, is doomed to go the rest of their life without such an experience.  If you really want to help such a person, get them the treatment they need. Mood disorders are staggeringly undertreated, because the sick mind works against its owner in many ways:   Crippling lack of motivation, and I'm supposed to make appointments, remember them, and go to them? Crippling inability to articulate my feelings, but I'm supposed to open up to this professional stranger? It's my brain, I should not need to take pills to live comfortably inside it Crippling inability to concentrate, and I'm supposed to take pills on a schedule? MAOIs and mood regulators make you feel like a zombie for the first week, and the come-down if you run out is one of the worst experiences known to man   For those reasons and more, most people will never seek treatment, and of those who do, few will follow through.  But, please, tell me more about what an indignity it is that I'm forced to live in my brain. Who are you to order my crippled mind not to destroy itself? Who are you to order horny adolescents not to fuck? Who are you to decree that a person under the influence of a drug can't consent to anything?"
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,actuallychrisgillen,2,Tue Jul 7 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...  It's a tough call. I'm just going to share my thoughts here. I apologize if it comes across more as a stream of consciousness than an actual argument, but this issue is complicated.  Firstly, it's important to understand that suicide isn't illegal, at least in my country. That means that right now you have the right to die. That's a right that has existed for decades and I see no reason to criminalize suicide or suicide attempts.   But that's not what you're referring too. What you're referring too is assisted suicide. A very different beast. So the real question is: 'if a chronically depressed person asks the state to kill them, should the state say yes?'  In short, yes I believe assisted suicide should be allowed. First reason is idealogical, I'm a libertarian by nature and strongly believe that people should be entitled to chart their own course. While I'm in no way looking forward to my death I would hope in my final days I retain the control to determine how I die the same way I determine how I live.   Secondly, I think we have a situation where suicide is legal, but safe and effective suicide isn't. That disconnect doesn't work for me and the fundamental principal of equality suggests that if some people have the right to assisted suicide, all should. Right now the most effective way to commit state assisted suicide in the States is suicide by cop, a very violent and messy affair.   Thirdly, sometimes you have to trust the experts. If her doctors are saying she's chronically depressed with no hope for remission and she's saying it. Well... sometimes you've got to just believe them and whatever visceral response I may have can't be interpreted as either knowledge or insight.  Lastly, I think about the harm to society as a whole. Other than the standard concern of someone being coerced or forced into ending their own life against their will I'm at a loss as to what large societal harm would be incurred.   I personally hate the idea that someone is so desperate to die that they would ask the state to kill them. It feels like a failure. A failure of medicine, psychiatry and society. But sometimes we fail. Not every disease gets cured and not every story has a happy ending, so if this provides some relief to a person who is suffering... well I'm not going to be one to say no."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,LysergicAcidDiethyla,2,Tue Jul 7 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"I firmly believe that all people have free will, and my belief is supported by two things:   We are said to have been given free will by God, and it is our personal choices and decisions that will influence our eternal fate.  We have the right to choose suicide, but the real question is: ""should we do it?"" We're unique, sentient beings.  None of us has the authority to make such decisions for other people.  Any such authority that does exist is artificial.  To end one's own life can only be up to the individual, not others.  No one else has the capacity to truly understand another person's mind.

I don't regret the attempt, and I wish I had succeeded.

I think this question will mostly come down to who is liable. I think most of us worry about this, which is why the question of choice can be so controversial. For those of us who are pro-choice, some of us may have grappled with deciding whether life starts at conception and after that deciding whether it correlates with our morals to terminate pregnancy if that where to be the case.  There is no absolute truth as these are man-made ideas. There are people who will never live a typical experience. They will not process emotions as most do or want as we do. Their autonomy and will is just as real and I think debating whether WE should let someone else decide something for themselves could add to the helplessness they've felt for so long.   As to the medical monopoly on substances that could aid in ending one's life, that's another question entirely."

I think the choice to die should be totally in the hands of the person.    I feel like for this to be a viable solution, a lot of precautions would need to be in place.  For example, we don't need a situation where a 20 year old gets depressed and is able to do this in the space of 2 months.  I feel like you should have to go through a year or more of preparations to make sure that this is what you really want."

This criteria would include the severity of the depression, the amount of time that the person has been depressed, at least three different medical professionals opinions re: whether or not the individual has any shot at getting better through help, improving exercise and diet, seeking a support system (outside of professionals), etc... If there is no shot at getting better then and only then do I think it's okay to commit suicide.  Depression at a very extreme level and for years on end would be unbearable, it would be hard to function and complete basic tasks, hard to hold down a job, hard to have a social life, etc.. and it truly is the same as a physical illness in the sense that it can be cured or reduced in terms of severity, but the situation might also be that there is no cure."

As someone else said in this thread, if we could account for all the outside influences of depression, then we would be in a position to answer that question because we would know that we have done all we can as a race. I don't believe we are currently doing all we can as a race and a society of human beings.

It is selfish and irrational to force other people to continue living when it is their own life.   That being said, I do not believe it is necessary to provide medical assistance. Medically assisted suicide should be reserved for those who are physically unable to complete the task themselves. The responsibility for a human being's death should not be spread any wider than absolutely necessary. Hypothetically speaking, we do not want to make suicide too easy (a la the suicide booths in Futurama). It should be the last resort.   Furthermore, I personally do not believe Depression is a logical reason to kill oneself. Perhaps this woman has an untreatable condition in her brain which would make it more understandable, but depression is treatable in many cases. Also, I tend to look at things from a macro perspective. There may be more creative ways to utilize an able bodied person who no longer wishes to live (willingly of course) that would benefit the rest of society.

See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/3buaom/what_is_your_ethical_opinion_about_a_person_who/csqce51  For cases where we strongly suspect the person is not of sound mind, then I think a good rule of thumb is to ask whether there is a reasonable hope that treatment would help them enough such that, after treatment, they would say they were glad they had underwent treatment. If there is no such reasonable hope, then they shouldn't be forced to live a life that they continually think is not worth living. However, if there is such reasonable hope, then we should indeed give such treatment, even coercively, precisely because they are not of sound mind and not able to correctly judge what is in their best interest."

The state always has to provide the option, then every person can make his or her individual decision. It is not anyone's place except the individual to decide whether or not they can terminate their lives.  Personally, I think people like that woman are heroes."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,yetitheyeti,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"I think for me, this boils down to a question of what you could consider a form of ""informed consent"". In a medical setting, a patient would be considered to give informed consent to a procedure/treatment if the doctors involved assess that the patient is well informed and fully understands the implications of the decision that they are making and that they are not under any duress. Another important thing for informed consent is that the patient is able to make rational decisions. If, for example, a patient is extremely drunk, they might not make rational decisions, so if they needed surgery that wasn't absolutely urgent/life-threatening, the doctor shouldn't let them agree to the procedure until they have sobered up so that they can fully understand what's being told to them.   How does this apply to depression?   Depression is a mental disease that is often caused by changes in the levels of neurochemicals or hormones in the brain. A good example is serotonin, which is an essential neurotransmitter in large areas of the brain. Serotonin is extremely important in a massive number of processes in the brain that regulate things like emotions, sleep/wake cycle, hunger and feeding, memory, and social behavior. The brain is very good at maintaining just the right levels of serotonin in the right places so that everything functions normally and we are happy, hungry, and we sleep well.   Now imagine that in one area or even in the whole brain, that serotonin level all of a sudden isn't right. Maybe something is causing less serotonin to be produced than normal, or maybe some of the neurons in the brain aren't responding to it as fast or as strongly as they're supposed to. Maybe the change is sudden, or maybe it develops very slowly over time. All of those brain and behavioral processes that are so important are suddenly changed. You stop feeling as good as you used to, you can't sleep very well and you're always really tied, maybe you're sore and ache everywhere, you have no appetite, you basically start to feel all or some of the awful symptoms of being depressed.  One thing that can happen, is suicidal thoughts start to surface and someone suffering from that may become obsessed with suicide, or decide that they don't want to suffer anymore. Over time, the neurochemical levels in the brain get farther away from the normal ""set point"" and the brain starts adapting to the changes and then change the way the brain is working. Imagine feeling that the only possible option in life is to kill yourself, and there is absolutely no hope otherwise. You adapt to that horrible feeling and you are 100% sure it's what you want. This isn't one of those things that you can turn off, and it runs so deeply that telling someone who is going through that to try to feel better is like trying to tell someone to go out tomorrow and climb Mount Everest.   This change is somewhat similar to changes that happen on a short timeline when someone gets drunk. All of a sudden there's a new chemical in the brain that changes the way that the brain circuits function changes, causing a drunk person to act drunk. If, say a drunk person asked a doctor to assist or allow them to commit suicide while under their care, the doctor would lose their license because that's an irresponsible thing to do, and the patient clearly isn't thinking rationally. You could say the same thing about a patient suffering from depression, in that although it is the right think to do as far as they are concerned, you can argue that the reason that they want to commit suicide is because certain areas or circuits in the brain aren't working normally. It would be kind of irresponsible for a doctor to assist with something like suicide, when restoring the patient's brain chemistry to it's normal set point might make the patient think completely differently. A drunk person would also likely regret that decision once sobered up.   The problem here is that depression is an INSANELY complex disorder with so many different causes. As researchers, we are constantly finding new explanations for certain problems in a certain group of depression symptoms or causes, and we still haven't even scratched the surface of the information that we need. Over the past 50 years, we have been able to develop ways to recognize and diagnose depression, and we have a huge number of different options for treatment based on each specific patient. Treatments might range from recommending increased physical activity for mild depression to deep brain stimulation for patients who aren't responsive to any medications. The thing is though, that there is a very high level of success in treating depression.   I'm in an interesting place because I also suffer from depression. I've been suffering from it since I was very young because I have a familial form of the disease, and I was very close to suicide many times as a teenager/young adult. The thing was though, that I eventually got help, started on antidepressants, and have worked for years in therapy to help me better cope with stress and feeling depressed. It takes a long time though to find the right combination of treatments and medication(s). Now that I have restored normal neurochemical levels in my brain though, I would never want to kill myself. I also recognize now that I wasn't thinking rationally when I was depressed, and it really did alter the decisions that I made. I am so thankful that I didn't seriously hurt myself, and I know many others who feel the same way.   So should depressed people be allowed to kill themselves? Not with the help of doctors or institutions. That wouldn't be responsible. That's why it's so important for people feeling depressed to get help. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Trust me, I've been there. It pays to talk about it. The social stigma against mental illness is a large reason why many people don't get treatment in time, and that's disgusting. Brushing off depression or other mental illness as ""just in someone's head"" is wrong. Guess what else is ""just in your head""..... YOUR BRAIN WHERE EVERY THOUGHT YOU'VE EVER HAD EXISTS!   Source: Neuroscientist that studies depression related to stroke.  Also note: Serotonin is not the only neurochemical involved in depression. There are literally hundreds that can go out of wack and be responsible for depression. I just used it because it's a good example, and increasing serotonin levels using SSRI drugs is very effective in some patients.   Edit: Clarified something."

TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:47:16 2015 UTC,"I just want to apologize in advance for this big chunk of text - this is my response to this question I wrote for a psychiatry open forum regarding the same question within the Canadian Health Care System that was published requesting responses last year from Canadian psychiatrists - It needed 3 posts, but I figured my response might be worth sharing for at least some.  As a life-long mental health patient for my entire childhood and adult life as an individual diagnosed with multiple comorbid hereditary genetic mutations active exclusively within the brain - one of which presents with the loss of serotonin regulation to produce familial major depressive disorder (MDD) - the above post by ArtHeartly honestly hits the nail on the head as an answer to this perpetual question in a way that, at least for myself and in my own experiences, has been alarmingly rare to come by in the past. Being myself someone who has struggled multiple times and been hospitalized on more occasions than I would like to remember due to suicidal-/depression-related complications in my mental health status, I think that it would do patients and psychiatrists alike a great dealt of good to give this explanation from ArtHeartly a read and then think long and hard about what it means to individuals like myself all over the world before choosing a side in this debate to support.  Following a long series of hospitalizations due to these type of neuropsychiatric issues, I ended up taking my search for answers into the field of neuroscience research, where I spent a large portion of my undergraduate and masters studies investigating many aspects underlying the etiology (cause of disorder generation), the impact and effects of the disorder upon learning, memory, and cognition in general, and in the pursuit of novel treatments that might provide a better means of symptom management than the somewhat rudimentary selection of SSRI's and SNRI's currently prescribed for patients with depression symptoms. I think that the majority of important information I've delved from my studies has been already said by ArtHeartly in a much better and much more straightforward way than I could ever begin to do so myself, but there has always been one piece of information about this all that only ever became apparent to me after grinding my way through this all and finding that elusive solution that was the end of my own depression - and I think it might be worth saying if it could perhaps help those on the outside understand the perspective of members in our community of mental health patients and their equally involved family members who endlessly and selflessly support them.  This concept has to do with a neuroscience experimental design which has been extensively utilized in the past century for the study of learning and memory that is called 'Pavlovian Fear Conditioning' - in the 50's, and most simply put, this consisted of an auditory tone being played to a rat - usually some sort of buzzer noise - while the rat was placed in a specific box apparatus; immediately following the tone, an electric foot-shock would be administered."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Final7C,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:12:54 2015 UTC,"Over time, this experience brings about the learning that this specific tone indicates the shock is coming, and in this way the animal learns to enact a 'fearful, maladaptive' response. So how does this relate to humans with depression? Basically, individuals who possess a depressive condition also have a quite intricate alteration within their processes of learning and memory: depressed individuals have an enhanced capacity for learning to predict and identify fear-inducing events or stimuli, a exponentially increased capacity for consolidating and storing memory representations that hold this fearful information, as well as both highly increased retention in the very long-term as well as improved recall for this stored information. So what does this mean? Basically, individuals with depression are able to learn to fear events of locations, even objects, in their daily lives at a rate which far surpasses the learning capacity of a normal, non-depressed individual. And thats when things get a bit more intricate with this one - in addition to this enhanced learning ability, depressed individuals at the same time have a suppressed ability to learn adaptive strategies in response to the event or stimuli discussed previously that elicits a fearful response. This adaptive strategy in a non-depressed individual would allow this person to - perhaps after burning their hand on a stove, the individual learns that by turning the stove off and waiting a moment the surface will be no longer hot and painful, thus 'extinguishing' the fear memory. However, in depressed individuals, this processes whereby the individual is able to acquire, learn, and then begin to practice at normal this adaptive strategy - or 'coping behaviour' - is robustly impaired, preventing the depressed individual from being able to dissociate the stimuli from the fear response, and thus rendering them unable to learn a way by which they can cope with the stimuli bringing them fear... and therefore in a way making that person 'stuck' at present in a state where the stimuli, whatever it may be, will always bring fear and distress, is perceived as a permanent source of this fear and distress as the individual feels completely unable to deal with this event occurring, and in which the person - just as I did - feels completely unable to deal or cope with this aversive issue or event as that person, in the state occupied during suicidal depression, is in all senses completely unable to even begin to formulate an adaptive strategy to cope with their depression, fear, aversion, and suffering.  Does this mean that a person who is depressed should as a right be able to, at this seeming point of incapacity with no end and not even a path to an end in sight, choose to by way of a physician end their life?  In my opinion, having been in this position tens of times and having been hospitalized to prevent this very event more times than I would care to admit along the way, the answer I would give to this heavy question here is that of a resounding and assured no. But, at the same time, I think that in order for me to be honest about my answer that it is also necessary for me to add that this very answer of 'no' that would deny me this choice of death would never, in any situation, have been my answer while I was going through these issues and hard times, and I think that I would have in this state answered in the exact opposite direction with assuredness in a frantic and pained effort to find an end to what I was going through and from which I saw no escape."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Pidgey_OP,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"But, from the standpoint I am in now, that discrepancy is the very precise factor that makes this discussion, this issue, this possibility of altering the framework of healthcare services caring for the mentally ill resonate with me. Because, from where I was before, stuck with my head down putting one foot forward at a time in an attempt of grinding the long and hard path to finally arrive where I'm standing today, I could not see, could not comprehend, and couldn't even begin to understand that there was another option in front of me that I could actually choose instead of ending my life and the never-ending suffering I saw in my future going forward as the only inescapable destination for my life. Understanding the science behind this now, I had the horrifying realization - as I hope I did not butcher above in my attempt to explain  from a purely scientific standpoint how depression, in its most basic essence, biologically entails the impairment in an individuals cognitive ability to perceive and formulate a feasible and attainable adaptive strategy estimated as attainable by which to deal with a horrific and fearful event or issue, and in addition a pervasive inability to learn, store, and recall these adaptive strategies and the information underlying their enactment and therein their application to cope in any sort of successful way with the stress and fear of depression - that this in itself, the incapacity to see that way of adapting to some sort of horrible situation, to be unable of even believing that I could adapt, and being unable to actually use an adaptive strategy which some helpful individual had helped me to throw together, means that individuals with depression are by definition impaired in their ability to see, comprehend, and create for themselves a strategy to cope with the terrifying and paralyzing task in front of them. And this scares me, because I know that if I had been given the option proposed by this discussion even just one time, if I had been given the free right to chose this option to end my life with the aid of a physician at that given point in time wherever it may have fallen in my past, I know truly that I would never have hesitated for even a moment before taking the path I incorrectly and ignorantly believed completely to be the only solution that I had left from which to chose.  And the fact that that option was not in front of me is the only true reason that I am sitting here plunking away typing on reddit right now. Because, by way of that precise inability to see a way out of my transient pain, I would have deemed there to be no enjoyable future possible for myself - even if that path was sitting right in front of me screaming to be noticed and adopted. But, because this option was not there and was at no point offered to me in this state, these very physicians being discussed here were instead able to engage in something the absolute opposite of what is being suggested here - to begin to walk me through these times of pain and despair, to take my hand and walk me down the very path that I was unable to see for myself or to even understand its purpose. By leading me every step of the way through this path despite my absolute lack of comprehension regarding the purpose of the pursuit I worked towards every day, through the steps and the stages and ups and the downs of the path to a way out without judging the fact that I never quite seemed to understood why we were doing these things, why we were making these changes and these routines, I began to be able to see and even eventually understand this path that by way of my disease I was blind to before. By refusing me this purported right of physician-assisted suicide, that very act enabled me to begin to be shown, step by excruciating step, that there was a way out; that my future was not hopeless. And over a longer period of time and with many hours of painful and at times seemingly hopeless work, I began to feel momentum in my life for the first time. I became able, by way of my physician's efforts to walk me down the invisible pathway to a solution instead of allowing me to end my life as I desired, to see that path, that adaptive strategy, that road to a solution that included for the first time my own happiness and well-being and with it a desire for a future for myself of growth and of progress. And because these professionals did not give me this option, over time, and admittedly following a great deal of mental and emotional development, growth, and sometimes just grinding out the work that needed to be done along the way, that path and that strategy that I had been working on and following for months became something more than a blind direction my physicians lead me along - it became something I could see, that I could understand, and that was defined in my own mind as the pursuit of a purpose in life I could both justify and understand, and in this moment - because my physician who I will be ever grateful to, when confronted with this exact question discussed in this thread instead chose the answer 'no' and took me in the opposite direction headlong into ambiguity and walked me down the path she knew would be best for who I am. And this essential choice has made all the difference in my life. Because by walking me in the opposite direction she gave me the ability to see that there in reality existed more than one option, and that the only reason it did not seem feasible was because I was biologically unable to see this option. And while I may have been unable to see this option, this strategy and this end-goal of a solution, and while I may have been on the opposite side of this discussion five years ago as an adamant believer that the only solution acceptable was the right and the choice to end my life, the choice my psychiatrist made denying me this choice and instead leading me to where I stand today - a choice I had no part in yet a choice that I will be forever grateful for which I will never allow myself to forget - I became with each day more able to understand, to actually be able to see, and to give importance and trust to the pursuit of my own happiness and of my own livelihood - something I had never before in my life been able to begin to comprehend."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,felzelle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:24:09 2015 UTC,"And by my physician making this choice and believing in its validity, I am now able to feel hope for a better future that I am capable of reaching, I am able to feel happiness again, I am able to feel purpose and desire in my life and in its trajectory moving forward, and I am content and most importantly relieved to be alive today. And I honestly believe that by providing such a choice at a time of such turmoil to an individual emerged in neurological turmoil and emotional distress is irresponsible, is unethical, is unjust, and would represent a decision that at its very core would in essence deny these very individuals provided with such a decision of their right to a future and of their right to take a different, harder road that, while long and winding, holds the very solution to ending the pain that I myself and every individual considering such a choice believed could only cease by way of death. And in my mind such a practice would contradict my morality and my value of human life, however distressed and in pain that single life might be at that incomprehensibly transient yet seemingly permanent period of the individuals path in life; one period that in my own mind should always be one of an innumerable and ever-expanding number of periods in life that hold the possibility of lacking depression, void of suffering, and even filled with happiness and hope. Because you may be depressed this year, but if you begin to make the right steps and place one foot in front of the other with the guidance of an understanding and caring health care professional, the next fifty might just be filled with so much happiness you could never have even seen it before. And I believe that to offer an individual such a choice while that individual is in such an extreme state of mental turmoil and pain is the decision by the external individual to, by way of offering such an option, validate and prove in the mind of the mental health patient that the permanence of the suffering they at present are experiencing is in fact as permanent as the pain feels to them, that the state of distress they are in is as severe and horrid as that person believes, and that a medical professional or physician specialized in treating that person's very condition believes themselves that a suitable course of treatment is suicide. And I myself cannot even begin to comprehend a greater possible blow that could be delivered to a depressed and suicidal mental health patient than the validation and verification received directly from those who care for these individuals that their cause is hopeless, and that death is appropriate.  Because in my experience, even if we are unable to see, to understand, to deem worthwhile the pursuit of a solution, this incapacity to perceive a path to happiness should not be the breaking point by which to deny suffering, struggling humans with a genetic disease that very solution they are by definition blind to. I feel that instead of the issue we are discussing here right now, than an individual might possess such an incapacity to comprehend alternative courses apart from death should be prompting discussions strategizing how these individuals in pain might be enabled to see life, and I would hope that some of you out there would possess or at least be open to entertaining such a perspective similar in some way to my own.   Yes, I would have answered differently before, and heeeell no, it was never for a moment easy to grind my way down that path chosen instead of death, but by my endlessly patient and amazing considerate physicians deciding to not present me this opportunity in my time of weakness, and instead walking me down that path I could never see for myself, I began to learn, I began to grow, and I began for the first time to be happy and content. And I think that, while I know the vast majority remain unaware of their desire for it, people who are depressed in the very same way that I was, deserve by right the pursuit of happiness, the end of their all-encompasing pain, and to the hope and desire for a future among the living. I guess in a vast oversimplification that I appologize for, I see it in this way: My mother is completely blind in both eyes, and has been for decades. Would you decide, because my mother is unable to see world around her and comprehend the information therein, that she should therefore as such be given the free decision to 'opt out' of said world and receive physician-assisted suicide instead of perhaps a somewhat less immediate and more work-intensive treatment of synthetic retinal implants so that she might at this point be able to at least perceive accurately the world which she had been offered the choice of opting out of? Do you honestly believe that, by way of my mother being unable to comprehend the visual world around her she should in as much be entailed to the absolute removal from it by choice, instead of responding by offering her a means to regain that what she had lost? Because in my head, if your answers to the two questions above are different, then I honestly hope in the core of my being to any higher power in the universe that you are not a psychiatrist."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,connstar97,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:53:43 2015 UTC,"I would lean on the side of ""no"". While I am a great advocate for people to have total control over their own bodies, we also have to ask if depression is to be considered a mental illness and if so, can people with mental illnesses be considered to possess the necessary faculties to make a rational decesion?  I suppose my question is partly rhetorical, because generally we do NOT consider the mentally ill to be capable of making rational decisions, especially life and death decisions.  I suppose my point is that if someone wants to kill themselves that much, they will always find a way to do it. But we shouldn't legalize it or make it easy for people to arbitrarily end their lives.   But then I suppose that's based on the idea that we as a society intrinsically value life. I suppose from a population control stand point we should actively encourage people to ""self-euthanize"" to stop the population from growing too far. Furthermore, we should encourage the mentally ill to end themselves so that those genetic traits (if there is a correlation) are removed from the wider gene pool which may result in a healthier population long term.  Personally I don't agree with those points, but I can see why some might think that way."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,Linshanshell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with euthanasia that is not for a terminal patient is. There are so many people that do not get the choice if they live another day, but a person suffering from depression, which is often a temporary chemical imbalance which can be eventually overcome (at least to the best of my knowledge but I'm not a doctor), the thought that someone would end their life at a part which is simply difficult to function is a bit insulting to the very act of being. I mean, I suppose it takes you out of the gene pool, which may strengthen the species but that's an awful pessimistic way of looking at it. Since we're supposed to say that depressed people are fighting the hardest fight every day of their lives. It's just that if you self select to forego reproduction and rear your offspring you've in essence stopped your genetic line. All of that data you've carried with you since the beginning has died now with you. Your evolutionary meaning is unfulfilled. But, that's the way evolution works, those with the ability to reproduce and survive last the longest. Though arguably the same could be said for people who enter the clergy, choose not to reproduce, or are homosexual. Are any of those inherently bad? No. They are all just people. But from an evolutionary standpoint, they do mean the end of a lineage, which, from that aspect is a bad thing, right? I suppose we could say that it's just a fact, and not good or bad. But for some reason my previous indoctrination tells me that life is good, and non-life is not good. Probably confirmation bias, since I've only been alive. But it's all the info I have to go on. So yes, if you have the choice to live, without severe terminal physical pain, you should probably do so, and find a way to work through it or live with it. Fall to God or religion or something to give you solace, or don't it's your life, just don't take anyone else with you."
TrueAskReddit,3cbjdb,KittyHammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:53:47 2015 UTC,"Here's my thought:  The decision to commit suicide should be a decision an individual of sound mind can make.  Where I think we run into issues is whether or not a person suffering from depression is of sound mind. Generally, depression is caused by a chemical imbalance, meaning they may make a decision in an altered state that they would not have made with their brain chemistry properly balanced.  It's the same sort of reasoning behind innocence by means of insanity, or why we don't try juveniles as adults. A brain that isn't functioning as it should is known to make improper decisions, and the person can't be held accountable for that.  Because of this, I don't think suicide can be a viable option for someone who is depressed (due to a chemical imbalance) because they may not be making the best decision for themselves in the long term. Their natural fight or flight kicks in, and since fighting hasn't solved the issue, running is the only option they can see (that is not to say that they are cowards, or running from their issue, but ""running"" as in ""flight"" of the fight or flight scenario)"

I saw one person talking sexual reproduction. All of this is out the window for an actual alien. Some of it may be vaguely applicable, but probably not.   I disagree. Yes, there certainly can be and and there very well may be organisms out there that are off-the-charts bizarre. However being bizarre doesn't make something intelligent. An organism that someone grew to become the size of its planet will likely not be intelligent, there's no reason for it to be from an evolutionary point of view.  If you replayed evolution of live on earth, and assuming that multi-cellular organisms appeared, you'd probably get very different looking creatures but they would still have familiar attributes. For example, there would be creatures that could fly. Flight evolved at least three times during earth's history: Insects, birds, and mammals all fly. With this in mind, I think that a replay of earth's evolution would also produce another species similar to humans. Who knows what it would look like or how it would behave, but it would likely have traits we would associate with advanced intelligence: creative, social, and tool-using.   This idea makes it seem plausible to me that most intelligent organisms would follow a similar evolutionary path. They probably were predators that had/have appendages to manipulate the environment. They were also likely social. I've read that social animals have larger brain to body size ratios than solitary animals. Organisms without these traits in place would likely never evolve to be something we consider highly intelligent. Dolphins or dogs, for example, are certainly intelligent, but they haven't designed a craft that could get them to the moon and back, perhaps because they don't have hands. Furthermore, they may follow a similar path of technological advancements. Our advancements build on those previous, I think it would be hard to really jump ahead on the ""tech tree.""

Flight of some form may still be possible on something that size, perhaps a large gas filled creature could float and propel itself through the air. Maybe more familiar forms of flight are still possible if the organism is small enough. Anyway, all I'm saying is that selective pressures produced flying organisms at least three separate times on Earth. Those sorts of selective pressures are likely present on every world with life, so we should expect to see flying creatures. And yes, if for some reason  flight was never selected for on another planet, then we would see other forms of locomotion in its place, such as sliding around like many creatures on Earth."

Not only will there exist environments in which all the crazy aliens that you talk about live, but there will also certainly be other ""Earths"" out there.  In our own solar system, we have several bodies with abundant liquid water. We know that water is one of the more common substances in the Universe because, again, it's pretty basic, and thus, more likely to accidentally arise in nature.   With that said, it would seem pretty likely that water oceans are common throughout the Universe, which would also mean that (tubular animals with eyes and fins) are pretty common as well.  I personally believe in an eventual future where we are able to look at any given environment, and determine the probability of animal characteristics based on that environment, based on our own understanding of existing life and biological mechanics."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,deepblueeverything,3,Fri Jul 3 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"No matter where you are in the universe, animals that exist in water are likely to have fins, because fins are one of the best, simple mechanical solutions to the problem of aquatic movement.   That's not even true on earth though. Look at squids and eels. They look nothing like fish and use a completely different mode of locomotion."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,tdogg8,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"likely   There are, of course, other possible methods of locomotion in the water. Fins are one of the best. I also think we'll see lots of tentacles and other methods of locomotion that we see on Earth. That was sort of my point.  The reason we see them is because they are mechanically viable, though some more than others, and no matter where you are in the universe, the mechanical viability of those traits remain true (given similar environmental conditions)."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,deepblueeverything,4,Fri Jul 3 22:18:42 2015 UTC,"Physics is universal, so is chemistry. With those facts in mind we now have some degree of constraint that limits what manner of life may evolve. Sure, you could imagine some kind of funky life that is based on a rare isotope of Bismuth (paraphrasing Neil DeGrasse Tyson, here), but it's much more likely that any life that evolves will be made of the same star stuff as us, right? Carbon, water, and nitrogen. Okay - check.  Next - our intelligent organism will need some means of reckoning its environment. That means sensory organs. Sensing light, sound waves, stimulus to/within its own body, chemical detectors, all pretty basic stuff. I think we could rely upon our intelligent organism having eyes, ears, nose (or an analogue). It's gotta have some means of manipulating its environment, so hands (or an analogue).   After that, it's all out the window. I agree with you that most of these answers are anthropomorphic. Starting with the very initial assumption that intelligent life will necessarily be social.  Complex society isn't the same as intelligence, it's just that humans happen to have both of those things. One doesn't necessarily imply the other, however. Ants have complex society and are very dumb, while the common octopus is very intelligent, but asocial as a species."

TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,Freiling,19,Sat Jul 4 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"I think some form of religion will always play a role. It starts with need to understand how the world around us works, but a lack of the means to find out for certain. So we make up stories. Humans came up with tons of explanations for what the sun and the moon are, and the overall structure of the Universe and where we came from. I think that this would translate to any intelligent beings."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,maowai,8,Fri Jul 3 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought too, and I'm surprised no one has debated you yet.

TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,StopMakingScents,8,Fri Jul 3 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree, and would argue that religion arose in mankind because we are a story-telling creature. Perhaps when we heard thunder, we told ourselves a story that the god X was angry, and, when we saw a rainbow, that god Y was pleased. It's almost as if we didn't seem capable of collectively saying ""we don't know (yet)"".  And what applies to thunderstorms and to rainbows applies likewise to birth and death, disease, fortune and misfortune, hallucinations, pareidolia and so on.  However, it's not difficult to imagine intelligent, curious life that doesn't involve storytelling - in particular, that can witness inexplicable phenomena and wonder about them without feeling the need to invent pseudo-explanations.  And as a side note, I wonder if such an intelligence would lead to more advanced developments simply because there are unknowns - if they don't have the ""god X did it"" rationalisation for phenomena, that would surely prompt more effort into finding out exactly what did cause them, with concomitant benefits for knowledge."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,Logofascinated,6,Fri Jul 3 09:10:29 2015 UTC,"Respectfully disagree. Storytelling is an inevitability of intelligence because it is one of the most primitive ways of transferring information, and, I think, a natural, expected evolution of the ability to speak.  Early humans told stories because they didn't have the tools necessary to actually find out why things happened, but it was a crucial part of human society because it was a way to share ideas (ideas which fostered the growth of society in some form or another.)   Storytelling also serves a crucial role in shaping social morals. There are plenty of stories, religious or otherwise, that exist to teach some moral lesson. This concept is probably even more true today, because we are more able to share our stories with one another than at any point in history."

I think fiction is an inevitability of factual communication, or just communication in general.

I really don't see how that fits in the discussion here.  If we're talking about religions versus no religions, and you had stated that the non-religious would ""evolve more"" (by which I assume you mean progress technologically) because they would care less, then I can see your point - if you've decided there's thunder because god X is angry, then there'd be less need to find out what's really causing it. A culture that says ""we don't know (yet)"" is likely to be one that wants to discover.  However, I strongly suspect that this is not what you mean. Your earlier statement that ""if its curious it will have religion"" seems to me to imply you think religion necessary for technological advancement. And I think this is spurious reasoning."

By agnostic society I meant a society that is agnostic about everything,now if they don't develop religion from the start it probably means less curiousity,less trying to explain things and if they don't pursue discovery(or explenation) of phenomenas from the start then I don't see alot of reasons that will cause them to do it in the future. Also,I look at religion the same way I do on war,it has alot of negative effects,its bad for the modern world but we needed it in the start,the first seed of curiousity in the form of story telling. Obviously in the future it would be used as a tool to control other people but on its base.religion was just innocent curiousity."

A side point is that (2) will slow down (1)'s contribution to technological advancement, as it has for humans."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,Logofascinated,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:14:59 2015 UTC,2 will indeed slow down technological advancement but I believe that a society that won't have 2 will probably be reluctant to to have 1 because if as primitive life forms they didn't try to explain phenomenas(even by using bullshit) then why will the urge to exlain the unknown would suddenly appear?You could say it would be because of war but what stops them from fighting at this moment?They could still develpe metal tools and transportation because its something that immdieatly give them fruits that they can see but I doubt they will try to explain things that are beyond them like the movement of the stars. I think that most if not all technologiclly advanced societies(at least in the level of the industrial revolution) will have religion in their history.
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,Not_A_Unique_Name,9,Sat Jul 4 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"It'll probably depend a lot on the group dynamics of the species in question.    If there's competition for mates, I'd expect to see sexual taboos, if most members are infertile (e.g. bees) then that probably wouldn't come up.  How strong the group dynamic is would also be important, a species that grouped together would probably end up more like us, one that tended towards loners might not have the same government systems we do."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,ghotionInABarrel,10,Sat Jul 4 09:44:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think a loner species would evolve higher intelligence, though. I mean, most benefits that come from high intelligence are also more or less only useful with the support of a group (Planning, coordination, advanced technology and construction). Loners would get a few advantages, maybe, but I think most organisms would  A) Develop high intelligence and ""herd"" tendencies.  or  B) Not develop high intelligence or ""herd"" tendencies."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,caliban321,3,Fri Jul 3 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. One of the major contributing factors humanity developed intelligence was the discovery of fire, and subsequently learning how to cook food, which significantly increased our ability to digest the food and nutritional intake.  This would not have been possible if we weren't herd animals. Some loner would discover fire, and then it probably wouldn't go anywhere. In that scenario, the loner would have to go against his biological instincts (and probably travel a bit) in order to teach his discovery to others.  It all comes down to information transfer. Social animals will be much more likely to communicate with each other and share ideas that could lead to or improve upon existing intelligence."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,deepblueeverything,18,Fri Jul 3 05:35:58 2015 UTC,I think races would naturally have some sort of fascination/drive for their form of reproduction that would lead to their versions of stuff like porn (like our sex drives lead to porn being so pervasive).   The only way I can see that not being present is if it was intentionally bred out of the gene pool. Like maybe they have an issue with overpopulation or the morality of their version of sex and kill off everyone with normal to high sex drives for generation while breeding the ones with low sex drives together.

TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,OtakuMecha,18,Fri Jul 3 03:12:35 2015 UTC,Yes I think evolution would favor it. Those that find sex pleasurable do it more and thus create more offspring who do it more than those that find it less pleasurable and so on.
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,kyxxx,10,Fri Jul 3 03:21:07 2015 UTC,"I think your suggestion is good because it combines evolutionary reasoning with societal developments. I wonder though, could a species with self-sacrificial sex (think some spiders) not evolve intelligence? I cannot see why that would be a breaking condition. Therefore, such a society would have the most disturbing porn. Perhaps some form of religion (sacrifice to reproduce). Surely a sentient being who knows it will ultimately die to reproduce must be fascinated by this inevitability (as are we regarding death)."
TrueAskReddit,3by2qs,DroidLogician,3,Fri Jul 3 03:28:42 2015 UTC,"With the exception of special circumstances (such as a parent sacrificing themselves to a predator so their young may escape), I think intelligence and instinctive self-sacrifice are mutually exclusive.   Think of the primary evolutionary motivation for parental self-sacrifice: it's to give the offspring some sort of advantage, be it a reduction in competition for resources, or some other esoteric benefit that can only be reaped with the parents' demise, such as using their bodies for food.   But I think intelligent species such as our own find more benefit in having elders; those past prime breeding age, whether they actually had offspring or not, who can focus on passing on traditions and experience and knowledge to the next generation. They have a clear place in the social hierarchy, usually near the top. Breeding-age adults are focused too strongly on finding a mate and contending with competition to take on these tasks.  Without elders, society cannot take form, at least not one that isn't fleeting or an arrangement of convenience."

Nothing is gained, the frequency of some alleles just became lower.  Evolve literally means to roll out, and came to have the meaning to develop, become more complex, and today, in most contexts, it means to become more advanced. In that sense of the word, societies do evolve. They often become more complex, and usually change over time.

I've read about that Armin Meiwes Case where the guy was punished in spite of the killing being an entirely mutual deal. That behaviour shall forever lie at the boundaries of acceptability. The full manifestation of Cannibalism fetish involves giving the ownership of one's life to another person, and the issue of the State interfering in this is very debatable. At what point does a sexual fetish stop being a fetish and turn into a crime or an act of depravity?  Especially when both parties are giving informed consent.  The case of Armin Meiwes's victim can be considered a good contender of the type of death I describe in my post. The 'victim' fully knew the consequences, and I dare say that his fantasy was so strong that he would have never been able to fully enjoy it while living.

Someone in chronic pain with no chance of cure isn't likely to have the above applicable, chances are they wouldn't change their mind if they'd really decided they want to die.  Of course then people would start questioning if ""just wanting to die for no specific reason"" is a mental illness itself, too, which would make this whole additional concept pointless.

""I've achieved the the best I could and thus should just end my life on a high note"", and ""I'm more or less lackadaisical about wanting to set new goals""   Is continuous setting of goals goals and continuing to live on life the only sign of a healthy individual?   both of which are signs of serious depression despite not being considered a form of aversion or disappointment towards life.   They are symptoms seen in depression, they are not symptoms specifically associated with depression and only depression.    I think such a mentality about ones accomplishments in relation to life and death is in itself a symptom of an unhealthy mental state.   If you look at it in a way, death is very much a part of life. Death can not happen without life in the first place. We, as humans, have found it possible to take many matters into our hands which other animals are forced to live through naturally. Why not the same about death then?   I think directly judging a person who is healthily approaching death as 'unhealthy minded' is a bit biased, the bias being our de facto consideration of life above death. This consideration makes total sense for animals, but if a human has arrived at it through an intellectual pursuit and emotional conclusion, his 'goal' need not align with the evolutionary goal, as is the case with many other things as I mentioned above."
TrueAskReddit,3buaom,Vilavek,0,Thu Jul 2 08:26:45 2015 UTC,"I should note that my argument has nothing to do with conceding to instinct or evolutionary drive.   We, as humans, have found it possible to take many matters into our hands which other animals are forced to live through naturally. Why not the same about death then?   There are indeed scenarios in which I can see wanting to die as a desirable or ideal solution. If I were terminally ill and guaranteed a painful slow death for example, I'd gladly participate in assisted suicide. But in the article you linked in your post for example, the state granted the right to die to person who is clinically depressed.   Is continuous setting of goals and continuing to live on life the only sign of a healthy individual?   Clearly not. However, I'd argue it is one of the signs of a healthy individual, but it is highly variable from person to person. I'd argue that for a person who places enough emphasis on goals as to want to kill themselves after having achieved them, there's a more serious underlying issue at work.   I think directly judging a person who is healthily approaching death as 'unhealthy minded' is a bit biased, the bias being our de facto consideration of life above death.   When a person decides ""I think I'll end my life now because there's nothing left to do"", I cannot see how that could possibly be seen as anything other than an unhealthy state of mind. It has less to do with an argument of the value of 'life over death' than it has to do with the fact that it is not normal mode of thinking for a person to be that detached and disinterested with life without suffering from mental health issues.  Death is part of life, there's no changing that. But ultimately, if a healthy minded person who wanted to end their life were asked to elaborate as to why, I am convinced that in doing so they would reveal underlying issues which would clearly show they aren't as healthy minded as they claim."
TrueAskReddit,3buaom,thepastIdwell,24,Thu Jul 2 08:38:23 2015 UTC,"That's just dogma.  Of course anyone can want to die for any reason, regardless of the state of their mental and physical health. Some are curious about death. Others have beliefs about what death entails and want to realize them. Others simply feel like they don't want to live anymore, for reason X. Maybe they've done all they ever wanted, or they don't enjoy the society they live in, or they just want a radical change in scenery. There's an ocean of possible reasons why a healthy person would want to die and all of them are valid.  ""I want to die now"" is just as neutral as ""I want to continue living"" or ""I want to eat a slice of cheese now"". It's just a personal choice.  If you think that death must be something no one could truly ever want, you're just being dogmatic about it and haven't really thought about it. Admittedly, the culture agrees with you, but who ever said that our contemporary society has a mature and reasoned attitude to death?

Say you are captured by malevolent kidnappers, and they take you to a basement in a building way out in the wilderness. Here, they begin to torture you, after informing you that they're never going to stop, and no one will ever find you. Excruciatingly much, intensely, and every day all the time with various methods. Within hours, days or weeks, you're completely broken and BEGGING for death. To this, they simply reply ""But you can't make that decision while you're suffering! After all, there's a theoretical possibility that someone will find this place, or that we all die of a freak accident. And if not, we still might die before you, many years from now. Hold on, it might happen! And if it makes you feel any better, once you stop suffering we can allow you to die as a means to escape this suffering, but not while you're enduring it. That would be crazy and immoral!""  This is the exact same thing you're telling depressed people or people with mental illness in general. Let it sink in.  The people who suffer right now are always the best judges whether or not they should continue living. Not you, me, society, the medical establishment or politicians. The one who suffers should have supreme authority at all times, or you are no better than those in the scenario I described.   Mentally stable people do not say things like ""I want to die"". ""I'm ready to die"" maybe, but not ""I want to kill myself now"".   False, I've talked with plenty of them and I've been one myself.

Of course depressed people and people who are being tortured are making choices they wouldn't make if they weren't suffering. But they are suffering! It's perfectly rational to want to make it end  at all costs when you're going through it. If you don't think so you've never really suffered. And depression is a lot worse than physical suffering.

Most people keep it to themselves or their closest friends only.  And the reason only depressed people have confided to you their desire to die is easily explained by statistics. One in five people will probably go through a depressive episode in their life. A common side-effect of depression is wanting to die.

The people who want to die because they're suffering want to die because they're suffering, yes, and they wouldn't want to die if they weren't suffering.  But it in no way does it follow that the latter group of people must therefore not want to die, since they're not suffering!  See the important non sequitur you're trying to squeeze in there?

TrueAskReddit,3buaom,DemeGeek,3,Thu Jul 2 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"Suppose we encounter a person (Bob) who says they want to die because they feel they have completed their life goals. Bob still has several decades of healthy life ahead of him. A team of psychologists, neurologists, and medical doctors have examined him and see he has no known health or mental issues. You might question this premise. If a psychologist interviewed him, might not the psychologist diagnose him precisely because he seems disinterested in further continuing life? There are two complications about this.   First, think of how crude an interview is as diagnostic tool. Instead of being able to look at complex, fine-grained structures in the connectome or seeing if there are any signaling pathways with neurons that are malfunctioning, we just look at outward signs of behavior. This can make it hard to catch mental illness when it does occur, like how Alzheimer's (or the precursors of it) progresses for quite a long time before it is noticed in behavior, and make it hard to avoid false positives, like in the Rosenhan experiment. Is it possible for someone to wish to die, just because they feel their life goals are complete, without some subtle emotional imbalance or the like? It is hard to say right now, simply because our knowledge and technology are too crude.  But there is a deeper complication, one that exists even if we have super-advanced diagnostic tools that can answer the above question. Saying that something is a disease, pathology, imbalance, disorder, etc., involves not only factual knowledge about how the biological systems work, but also involves a normative claim about what is good or bad. Some bacteria can be an infection, but the kind of bacteria in my gut are not a infection or disease because they are good for me. Most viral infections are bad for my lungs, but what if you use a virus to infect my lung cells with genes to cure my cystic fibrosis or asthma? The method of replacing genes in a cell is the same, the only difference is whether it contributes to my flourishing as a person. But what are the conditions for my flourishing? Suppose we use our super-advanced diagnostic tools on Bob and we do find some subtle physical differences in his brain. This difference might be big, or it might be as small as having the neural structure required in order to have that one particular desire (to end his life because his life goals are complete). That, by itself, is still not enough to say that Bob is mentally ill. We have identified the physical differences, but we also need a defense of the normative claim that that difference is bad for his flourishing as a person.   So the question now is: can Bob have a physical difference in his brain that both (1) entails his desire to end his life because his life goals are completed, and (2) this physical difference fits within the range of physical differences that any reasonable normative theory of flourishing would accept? We can approach this question from two directions. The first direction is empirical. Once we achieve the knowledge and technology to develop super-advanced diagnostic tools, we might see that, in every case of a person have a desire like Bob's, they all have some subtle physical difference that entails, say, a kind of disinterestedness in life that might be bad under any reasonable normative theory of flourishing. The second direction is normative, where we use philosophical discourse to figure out what is the range of reasonable theories of flourishing. The more progress we can make from each direction, the better we can understand the ways that people can have (1) and (2) and therefore we can more definitively answer whether they are some cases where (1) and (2) can coexist.  I cannot provide much help with regards to the first direction, but is it possible to currently make enough progress on the second direction so that they will meet and thus yield a solution? You might think ""Surely any reasonable normative theory of flourishing must entail that dying (when you feel physically/psychologically healthy under your own standard, when you are not in danger of torture, etc.) is bad!"" I do think that the value of conscious experience might be sufficiently basic in value that any reasonable normative theory must accept it, but even if that is the case, other factors may make it still reasonable to Bob to desire to end his life. Maybe he has good reason to not seek new goals, or maybe he has a reasonable fear that, by continuing to live, he will undo his previous accomplishments. Here's a parallel perspective: pain might also be considered universally bad, but other factors can make the pursuing of pain to be a reasonable part of person-flourishing. Some people think that BDSM can be a reasonable part of person-flourishing and, even if that example seems a little too strange to you, remember that the same pain-to-endorphin rush happens when you eat really spicy food. We also actively pursue activities with an element of danger, like sky diving or bungee-jumping. The pain and danger of these activities is outweighed by other factors that make the overall experience good for person-flourishing. Similarly, maybe the larger context of Bob's desire makes it good for flourishing across his entire life, even though it involves the ending of his life now.  However, you could also argue that, unlike the cases of eating spicy food and bungee-jumping, death (when you feel healthy by your own standard, when you are not in danger of torture, etc.) is a kind of activity that doesn't allow any such larger context. Maybe part of person-flourishing is the value of seeking new goals, even at the risk of undoing previous life accomplishments. Maybe there are some goals that Bob should have that would require him to live at least the rest of his healthy life, like helping others who are suffering through starvation and poverty.  My own personal view leans towards the latter answer. But we need to separate this from the question of whether or not we should be allowed to prevent Bob from killing himself. There is a concept developed by political philosopher John Rawls called the range of conceptions of the good. In a pluralistic society with Christians, Buddhists, atheists, etc., we might disagree on which particular conception of the good is right (like whether it is good to worship the Christian God, etc.), but we agree that there is a general range of what should be legally acceptable or not. A person should be allowed to pray to a different God than I what I may believe in, but a person should not be able to practice a religious ritual involving killing random people. It does seem like the view that we have the right to our own bodies, even if it isn't correct, at least fits within this range, and so it seems like, if a person like Bob seems truly of sound mind as far as we can tell of any legal decision, then he should be able to kill himself.   You might object here, saying that, while the right to our own bodies fits within this range, the right to destroy that body does not. To this, I would reply by saying that we must consider not just de jure legality but de facto legality. If we suddenly had the technology that could physically prevent any person, at any time, from killing themselves, we would feel really uncomfortable about having laws against suicide that were constantly enforced. There are many atheists (and other groups) that would feel their rights infringed in the same way that a Buddhist's rights would be infringed in a strict Christian theocracy. The reason we might feel okay with de jure illegality of suicide (and many people do not) is because we recognize that it is largely unenforceable and thus de facto legal. You have to go through a specific set of interactions with other people (like psychologists and police officers) in order for you to be physically prevented from committing suicide. The vast majority of time spent by the vast majority of people is spent in situations where people could kill themselves before someone could stop them.  Our society's current approach to the legality of suicide is far, far from ideal, but it strikes an imperfect balance between helping people who seem to be mentally ill enough to need help (like in the sense that they later would be thankful for that help) while also de facto allowing people who really seem of sound mind to kill themselves (like how a terminal cancer patient is still legally allowed to buy a gun). We should seek to improve that balance, not abolish it.  I want to close by reiterating an earlier point: while Bob should be allowed to kill himself, I think that his reasons are not good enough. If he truly is of sound mind and his goals are completed, then I think his goals were too limited. Person-flourishing is not just about checking off items on a bucket list but about exploring (and perhaps changing) our nature as sentient beings and our place in Existence."

Honestly I wouldn't encourage them but at the end of the day I think it's wrong to force someone to live if they genuinely don't want to. I will say if you are healthy, and especially if you are young (it sounds like you are) you might as well just wait it out, something good may happen and you will die anyway so have some patience. If you care about enlightenment you want to die an experienced person whose had life experiences that shape and challenge their philosophical outlook.  Wanting to live, or not wanting to live both are at their core subjective choices. One isn't more ""rational"", it's just most of us have a strong preference built in for self preservation. I'd also argue it's because we live in a culture built on judeo-christian values.  In regards to deaths in the ancient world, it's complex, unlike us they generally were built on a very different set of values. People often committed suicide because it was considered above being dishonored, to allow their property if charged with a crime to not revert to the state and be inherited by their relatives. Also the ancients loved to give their historical figures a dramatic and symbolic death. There are a plethora of deaths that seem to be ascribed to people because they make terrific metaphors."

TrueAskReddit,3buaom,DemeGeek,4,Thu Jul 2 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"for most living things.   This is the most important part, though. Most living things can not exercise logic or reason with enough ability to plan their life. We humans often plan our lives, even today, with 'future pleasures' in mind, rather than the immediate present ones. We toil in our youth so that we get a good old age. Most animals don't do that, their thirsts are more immediate and direct.   Humans, by exercising reason, have come to differ from animals in many instinctive aspects. As such, it is possible for a person to intellectually arrive at a position where he/she is satisfied by life, by overriding the 'life preservation' instinct."

You can't die right now saying that you're satisfied, because maybe tomorrow something will make you even more satisfied and happy!', which is akin to encouraging him to keep on reading because the book isn't over yet.  I too will have a different reaction if my own loved one decides to opt for an Euthanasia, even more so if that person is perfectly healthy in all aspects. I'd be stricken with grief, and pry to them about really doing this.

That being said, not all wishes to die are 100% unreasonable. Someone who has an illness or pain that makes day-to-day life unbearable might be seen as reasonable.

People who have completed their life goals might find it hard to find another ""goal"" worth achieving and fall into  a sort of depression which would lead them to welcome death as the next stage.

Another possibility is that one arrives at a sense of completion after living a wholesome life. My opinion is that this is very much possible.   As for the Mahasamadhi thingy (it's called different things in different cultures), it was just a theological example to relate to, and not my main point of discussion. It is said to be possible for a spiritually 'enlightened' person, like the Buddha. Not all such people did it, but some supposedly did. Examples historically include the Buddha and many other Indic philosophers and saints, Zen Masters, Calanus.

TrueAskReddit,3buaom,Omikron,3,Thu Jul 2 07:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, these religions have the concepts of reincarnation and rebirth. But the thing is, these processes, theologically, stop after enlightenment. The Buddhist term 'Nirvana' means going extinct or blowing out. The soul doesn't just 'stop being born', it dissolves away, because the 'ego' which drives the soul's desires and fears ceases to remain in any control, and without desires, a soul doesn't need to exist in a material body to fulfill them.  So while the regular person's death doesn't seem as 'permanent' in some eastern traditions, a death after the 'Samadhi' or enlightenment is more permanent than the death held by in any Abrahamic religion. In some interpretations, this death is so 'total' that it's very close to the death as imagined by a rationalist atheist: a complete full stop."

Right, because mental health is very subjective.  Physical health is not,  it's easy to tell when someone is bleeding, there can be no dispute.  Mental health, though, we have an accepted standard, not a threat to themselves implies that people need to be protected from themselves.  And I just cannot abide by that assessment, that was decided subjectively, not objectively.  Objectively speaking, if an organism is a danger to itself, it should be allowed, within its own power, to cause itself harm and possibly even death.  Who are we to place a standard down, who's to say that it's not part of humanities drive?  You know, maybe those of us who are inferior stock need to be culled, and maybe we know it.  Maybe we get suicidal so as to help maintain a balance between ourselves and the world?  I think that the biggest issue I have with mental health issues is that doctors have been given a standard. And with that standard comes the pills that may or may not do what they're supposed to, and the detrimental side effects of not taking them anymore.  I don't know how many people I've heard of taking their own lives because they stopped taking their anti-psychotics.  And here's where I have to nullify my own points so you don't have to.  In the current paradigm, I am completely ass backwards.  People need to be put on medications because they need to be protected from themselves. Regardless of what they want, because they have been labeled insane, they have no say anymore and need to be taken care of and handled appropriately by those who have that individuals best interest in mind.  I'm wrong for thinking that there's any other way of looking at it because YEARS of medical research has gone into creating the current paradigm and the people who are in those fields are there solely to protect those that need it.

At some point I just realized that no one else was judging my every step and it became a lot easier to do the same for myself. I don't love everything about myself but I'd still be my friend.   Instead of thinking you need to like yourself, think about it more as accepting yourself. You have good and bad in you. Acknowledge that. Get comfortable with it. Remind yourself of why you'd be your own friend.   As for what you can do to change? Well, a bit of self care goes a long way. Exercise a bit, wear trendier/dressier/otherwise nicer clothes, keep your hair maintained. Don't just roll out of bed and do the bare minimum. Effort will make you more attractive than just your natural looks because effort is related to confidence. The more you do for yourself, the more you'll like yourself and the more others will also like you."

TrueAskReddit,3boozd,theloniouszen,3,Sat Jul 4 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"You didn't really pick up on the nuance - it's not contradictory at all. You're assuming people doing anything for themselves is a product of vanity or insecurity which is just a flat out incorrect assumption. It's also not just about appearance. It could be about maintaining hobbies, or learning something new.   There is an extremely huge difference between doing something for yourself and doing something for someone else. For example, going to the gym every day made me feel disciplined, dedicated, hard working and like I had control of my life. Doing my makeup in the morning before work makes me feel like I'm 'trying' for myself.   It is completely possible to practise self-care while not disliking yourself or worrying what others think.

I realised that things I was considering as fatal flaws in myself were things that, in others, I would consider negligible- or even just interesting human colour. Why should it be okay for them, but not for me? And why was I considering those things as independent failure points, rather than viewing them as part of the composite picture of my personhood?  Either I was being too hard on myself, or I didn't respect the people around me enough to hold them accountable. I knew it wasn't the latter, so it had to be the former.  It hasn't fixed everything, but it's certainly helped a lot. I have to consciously practice it- when my brain is obsessing about a particular flaw or fuckup, I think, ""If this were <friend> instead of me, would I hold it against them?"" That mantra lets me reevaluate whether it's something I should invest energy in fixing, or whether it's just not that important.  Hopefully that helps you too, OP."

The idea is to think of bad things in your life as impersonal, specific, and temporary, rather than personal, general, and permanent.

Over the past few years, I've been finding that I dislike the person I am more and more. I've been introverted, self-isolating, and most importantly I've been limiting myself socially. because I don't want people to be uncomfortable.  There was an ex-gf that I ended things badly with. I had no feelings for her and used her emotionally to satisfy my own personal needs. I realized I did wrong, but I hadn't really forgiven myself for that in all this time. So I sent her a long detailed message about how sorry I was, not expecting a return message or anything. Just for my peace of mind. But there was her reply in my inbox, she was very honest. Apparently she forgave me years ago and hoped I was doing well now. We caught up a little bit, and then we signed off. Not the response I expected, and definitely not the response I thought I deserved.  In the weeks following, I was able to reevaluate all the decisions I had made in my life through a different, less burdened perspective. All this time, I was caught in this mindset, that deep down, I was a bad person because I was capable of using someone. Now I see that I viewed all my interactions with others through that mindset and I constantly felt like I was using people to my personal advantage. I still have some progress to make, but that was definitely holding me back from bettering myself.  TL;DR I didn't like myself because I thought I was a bad person. Personal forgiveness and introspection helped me realize that I was seeing my current self through my past actions. I can change who I am now, but first I needed to change how I see my past self."

TrueAskReddit,3boozd,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:36:58 2015 UTC,"Well you have to start sorting out what it is that you don't like about yourself.   Some things you'll have to change the same way an addict starts to quit. There will be lapses, but you have to decide you're not like that anymore and you try to change. These are things like being violent or an asshole, or a compulsive liar.   Some things, like being weird or quiet, you can own 'this is me, anyone who doesn't like isn't worth my time'  Same goes with appearance. Do you dress poorly (by your own definition)?, you can change that. Bad hygiene? You can fix that too. There are some more 'permanent' things about your appearance, for the most part you should own those too, but if you just can't get over one or two things, sometimes it's easier just to fix it medically (teeth, implants, nose job, mole removal, skin flap removal). This shouldn't be your go to solution though. It's best just to love the permanent parts of yourself as they are.   Then you look at the good things about you. Sometimes it's easier to ask friends and family about this, since you usually can't see this as well as they can. Try to do those even more. Here you can also pick one or two weaknesses that are really hamstringing your life and work on them. For the most part though you work on your strengths and work around your weaknesses.   This isn't a temporary 'I'm going to fix myself so I can love myself' thing. It's a permanent 'make myself into a better me' thing. Once you switch to this mode then you can't not love yourself.

U.S. veterans care  is comparable to slightly better than other developed nations:    http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/09/14/where-does-our-va-stand-when-compared-to-other-countries/    As for being imperfect, I don't think any care ever could be perfect.  But someone who is medical discharged due to an injury in training or combat will receive both a disability check and a retirement check.  While each service members case is different, and the amount will be based on their rank, time served and nature of injury, this amount will often add up to anywhere from 50% to 100% of what they received on active duty.  Someone like myself, with no major injuries, just aches and pains from 12 years of service will still get around 25%.  Someone seriously injured enough to be medically retired will also get free medical care for life.  For me, I at least get free care for the specific things that are injured.    In addition to the well known GI Bill that pays for tuition and a fairly generous living stipend for college students, service members also receive job placement preference in all federal jobs, many state jobs.      I don't know, it seems like a pretty decent deal to me."

I was referring to the common response to a critical point. If I say ""you forgot to do x"" and you say ""well, I'm not perfect"" then you are implying that I expect perfection and I don't.   It's very simple though. If the govt actually took care of its soldiers then there wouldn't be any need for even one charity. That wouldn't be perfect but it would be just. I'm a veteran so I'm well aware of the deal it offers. It's not a terrible deal assuming you don't actually get injured, hence the charities like Wounded Warrior.  The crux of the matter is that all of this is unimportant concerning how we take care of our soldiers except one category - the injured. Everyone else, it could be argued, do actually get a pretty good deal but the ones with PTSD and/or physical injuries don't. The charities, ironically, are there mostly to support the very soldiers that deserve support from the government they injured themselves in the service of.   The VA is another example of this discord with what we proclaim and reality. It's supposed to provide the best care to soldiers but is easily debunked if one just asks ""where are all the rich people clamoring to get VA medical care?"". If the rich don't want it then we can assume that it's actually a cost-cutting measure and not really about exemplary care. The recent stories about the VA bear this out. The soldiers are getting very substandard care. This is pretty obvious if you use your common sense though. If the govt truly wanted to give the soldiers the best medical care they would simply give them outstanding private insurance and then they get could get the best care. Yes, your care is free as in included in your enlistment, but it's hardly adequate. It's just enough to keep you on the battlefield. Once you're injured, charity time.  Also, you are not taking into account that soldier pay isn't equivalent to private sector pay even at 100%."

The curruption of the Vietnam war was a lot bigger than than those soldiers, many of whom were drafted, therein kind of victimized by the government in being forced to be involved in a conflict they didn't agree with either.   What i sometimes say to people who question me and call me unpatriotic for being against the war is, well I ""support our troops"" so much as human beings, that i don't want us sending them over seas to be injured, traumatized and killed for an unjust cause.  Also i get a lot of crap for this too, but i refuse to respect soldiers and veterans any more than i would respect any other person, unless they show me as an individual that they deserve my trust and respect. Nothing about signing up and donning that uniform makes you some kind of infallibly moral god-figure. It doesn't even necessarily mean that you're a good person. A lot of people do really shitty, questionable things when they're deployed, and i think the military generally breeds a bad environment with a really toxic breed of immature ""macho"" masculinity. Something like 30% of women in the US military report sexual assault and rape? A ton of male service members  experience sexual abuse too. People in the military are committing these crimes, and other people in the military are letting them get away with it. What about that is objectively entitled to my respect?  I honestly think the whole machine behind it is disgusting. The US government selling this propoganda romanticizing war as ""fighting for your country,"" creating this culture where it's heresy to disagree with the war or not give service members the respect you somehow owe them. To a poor kid out of high school who can't afford college, hell yeah getting respect and honor for serving your country sounds awesome. Maybe they'll even pay for you to go to school.

TrueAskReddit,3bn6mo,EatingSteak,4,Wed Jul 1 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"Not true. If you don't get promoted there is high-year tenure and you get booted. So if you can't promote past E-5, the max you can serve is 15 years, which means you get no pension at all. And a lot of times lack of promotion is due to a particular field being overmanned so it is virtually impossible to get promoted. And, relatively minor fuck ups can get you in trouble and either get you busted (lose rank) or at least affect your ability to promote.  Also, 50% pay is somewhat misleading. A retiree gets 50% of BASE PAY, which is nowhere near his full compensation. So while getting a pension immediately upon retirement is a good deal, it is not quite as lucrative as some want to believe.   And you know what, it is voluntary but you can't just ""un-volunteer"" if you don't like it.  It is almost impossible to know what you are getting into because there are so many variables.

I think it's very morally dubious to join an army fighting abroad (defending your home soil is the opposite - I think everyone should then join in).   Anyway, I think your support for soldiers depends on your support for war in general, not on any particular war."
TrueAskReddit,3bn6mo,offlightsedge,3,Tue Jun 30 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"No.  At this point in time the American military is entirely voluntary.  This means that every person in the military made the conscious decision to be there.  Whether or not they regret that decision isn't my problem, they should have thought ahead.  I respect people on an individual basis, and just being accepted into a branch of the military doesn't cut it.  I didn't vote for the war, I didn't force anyone into military service, and I therefore have no inclination to support the soldiers.    I've met cool soldiers, and I would support those soldiers.  Most have been vapid, aggressive, racist, cocky assholes, and I wouldn't support them at all.  If I see a soldier on the streets, I walk by and don't say a word.  I won't harass anyone, but I'm not going to praise and thank random soldiers for signing a few papers, passing the ASVAB, and being given a uniform.    I feel bad when the government treats the survivors like offloaded garbage, but I didn't create the problem, and their sacrifices were not made for my benefit, they were for the benefit of the ruling class.  The people who sent them to be sacrificed should be the ones supporting them.  I pay taxes for that purpose."
TrueAskReddit,3bn6mo,Exexexpat,2,Wed Jul 1 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"My opinion is no one should support any soldier fighting wars in foreign land (with very few exceptions, WWII for example). But once that soldier returns to the country as a civilian, I'll support them the same as any other person."

You might say those individuals are naïve but many of them are young and idealistic. Whether or not our politicians are corrupt and go to war for questionable reasons, don't shit on the members of the military because you disagree with the politicians.  Also, while current wars (hell, maybe EVERY war) aren't about defending your freedom, I still signed up because I believed I might someday have to do that, and I did it knowing that I might have to risk my life doing it.   Lastly, there is a difference between ""doing it for the money"" and joining the military in part to make a living.  I mean, I could argue that if you work for a company that is owned by one of the gigantic corporations like GE that shits all over the US and its laws that you are immoral for working for them.

Wars won't stop if we have less soldiers because then the work will just be contracted out.   Any person who is funded by the government in any way should quit as soon as policies are passed that people don't agree with.

Are you serious? That's insanely impractical for many many reasons.   You cannot simply ""quit"" the military, you sign up for a contract. You also cannot simply find a job after quitting the military.   Jobs do not come that easy, particularly when you've spent most of your time in the military and not developing skills and experience to get whatever job you're applying for.   Any person who is funded by the government in any way should quit as soon as policies are passed that people don't agree with.   Thats awfully noble. But who are the ""people"" and what are the ""policies""? Many people did not support the war in iraq, many people did. Whether or not you agreed with it was irrelevant at the time if you signed up to serve because, again, you signed up for a contract.   Even if they are willing to do work and help people, they're bad people for ever being part of an organization that does something people don't agree with.   You can always find ""people"" that ""disagree"" with anyone and anything. The military, and the geopolitical power we live in are incredibly complex. The wars and ""missions"" we engage in are also insanely complex. You cannot condone everything we do as a country or military power, but you cannot also blame every military personnel for being causal or supportive of the our worst militaristic actions."

TrueAskReddit,3bn6mo,muffin9,-2,Tue Jun 30 21:39:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, not all soldiers are volunteers. In the United States, yes. But that wasn't always the case, and who knows if it always will be.    Second, not all soldiers join the military to fight in a specific war. Some join to pay for school, others to defend the nation, others because it's a family tradition.  Not all who fought in Iraq joined the military to fight in Iraq.    This is important to understand because the job of the soldier is to obey, and to die if need be.  When a soldier joins the military (or is forced), he or she does not necessarily know when the next conflict will arise.  Therefore, you can't reasonably criticize the soldier for being involved in a conflict that he neither started nor knew would happen.    During Vietnam, those who didn't support the troops because they didn't support the war did very little good.  The soldiers were drafted for the most part, and had to either fight or go to jail and risk being socially outcasted.    It's one thing on an individual level.  If you hear a soldier say they joined to kill the towel heads, then sure, don't support him.  But there are so many people who join the military for their own special reasons that it's impossible to judge their cause.    So yes, we may have had no business in Iraq, but it's unlikely that all the soldiers who fought there wanted to be there, or even planned on being there.   The job of the soldier is to fight, and if necessary, to die.  Their job description doesn't include the tidbit about fighting vastly weaker enemies for causes alien to our principles."

Source: my dad was a volunteer firefighter and my uncle is a paid, career fire marshall.  In the case of firefighters, the word volunteer distinguishes people who literally fo it for charity, and people who make a career out of it.  Also, running into burning buildings to rescue people who are in danger, and gaining nothing in return is, i'd say, quite different morally from being paid a salary to run into underdeveloped parts of the world and involve yourself in complex, volatile conflicts wherein you're often putting civilians in danger, both directly and indirectly (by destabilizing a civilization and leaving a void for bad people like, idk ISIS to rise into)."

Suffice to say that those people are inclined to kill no matter if they're in a war zone or not while the vast majority have no intention or desire to do such.  How many soldiers have you actually talked to?  As for destroying countries.... I think you'll find that most don't give that particular bit much thought.

TrueAskReddit,3bf2hi,skyclerk,41,Sun Jun 28 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"Well firstly, humans are tribal. We like putting ourselves into categorical boxes. Labels are important and useful -  We need labels in order to define things. When I tell someone I am gay, I am using that as a quick way to communicate the fact that I am interested exclusively in men. And yes, this may only be based on historical data, but historical data is what we use to make future predictions. Will I ever be sexually interested in a woman? I can't say I won't, but with the information I have available it is definitely unlikely.  There are definitely people whose sexuality is more fluid, and perhaps the label of ""bisexual"" is too broad for them. Maybe this label needs to be split up to cover the broader range of sexual preferences that exist. But I don't see labels of any sort ever going away."
TrueAskReddit,3bf2hi,Rombom,7,Sun Jun 28 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's not that categorical boxes are something that stereotypes people and pounds them a fixed identity, rather the problem is that categorical boxes are sometimes limiting. What if you don't belong in that box? You make a new one. But that new box needs naming too simply because humans need to put name to things. Sure, we shouldn't slot ourselves in one box and declare that this box is our only identity. Everyone can shift from box to box, can belong in two or more, but we still need to distinguish one from the next. Imagine writing down in every survey, ""well, I only believe in God when there is some proof the he exists but I'm not completely denying God exists"" instead of ticking in ""agnostic."" Surely there are outliers, but in one form or another, labels are useful.   Not everything in this world can be totally subjective. We can be objective about our identities and it doesn't necessarily have to be for a negative reason."

It often reads as apologetic, a particular blend of self-hatred and special-snowflakiness.   Labels should be in place for issues of practicality. All gay people, in addition to sharing the obvious attribute of loving people of the same sex, share a particular set of cultural experiences that someone who is not gay will have no access to.   When discussing the experience of these people, especially in terms of improving that experience, we need an available shorthand so we're not constantly working in circles, repeating ourselves.  Ultimately, refusing the label ""gay"" (or ""black,"" etc.) is a deliberate choice to actively distance oneself from those that share your cultural experience. It's hard not to bristle at that.  There's nothing wrong with being gay, or being seen as ""gay""... So just deal with the fact that things have names and move on."
TrueAskReddit,3bf2hi,monsieurxander,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"Three valid reaons people do.  Not everyone is technically fits into a check box shares the same cultural experience  For some people involuntary associations, or what group they are a part of doesn't mean anything to them. Community to some people is nothing more than a nuisance. There indentity doesn't come from social connections. More socially oriented people often have a hard time understanding this.   Not everyone wants to be a part of where they technically ""came from"". They worked hard to leave, didn't particular like it. They may not nessecarily hate the group they came from, but don't want to be part or said collective group.  The first two apply to me for example I'm technically mixed race (black and white), but I don't really view myself as having the same background as most mixed race people and don't want to be really part of a group in that way. I am also not really connected to the black community. I always fit in easier with white people, more than either black or mixed race people since I can remember. I just don't view myself according to any label, as part of some interest group or voting block.  It wasn't a deliberate  conscious choice, it just naturally for what ever reason what I leaned to.  Why should I use a label that inaccurately alludes to a connection I don't have. Why am I obligated to be a representative in that way of something I'm not a part of, because some people think I should be or feel connected to.  Also any success I have, I would be insulted if it was labeled as successful hyphenated X, instead of just successful X, the prior reeks of you're part of the b league, the bar is lowered for what's impressive.  Personally I find group people more annoying. I don't get why someone enjoys that. So I am just as confused by people who embrace labels as you by those who don't."

TrueAskReddit,3bf2hi,gamegyro56,10,Sun Jun 28 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"We live in a world where being straight is considered ""default."" Gay people have to ""come out"" and negotiate their identities in a way straight people never have to.   Gay people have to consider how, and when, they let people know they're gay. (To a lesser extent in liberal enclaves, but it's always a consideration.)  Gay people have to consider local laws when moving to other places. It's still legal to fire someone for being gay in most states, while certain regional cultures are downright hostile.  Straight affection is never questioned, within reason. Slight gay affection is called ""shoving it in my face,"" etc. This escalation is largely due to people not being exposed to gay affection in their lives or in the media.  On a similar note, gay people have to search for quality depictions of themselves in the media, while their representation is confined to a handful of contexts. Gay people are non-existent in children's media, and even superhero films.  It's socially acceptable for a straight person to hit on whomever they choose. Gay people tend to flirt in code, making sure the other is gay before being overt... or confining themselves to gay-specific bars and apps.  It's still a debate whether to treat gay people with dignity and give them the same rights. They're well aware of multiple religious and political organizations are actively working against them. The scale of that can be overwhelming.  And like most minorities, gay people are asked to be Ambassadors from time to time, explaining their experience to people who haven't shared it.  Obviously, the severity of these examples vary by region and subculture, and it's a lot better than it used to be. But one major court victory doesn't undo an entire system of specific challenges.   I'm not one to wield buzzwords like ""privilege"" as a hammer, since everybody's got their shit to deal with... This is just our shit."

My mind turns right away to the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, specifically the subset that deals with how having a language of notation to describe something enhances how you experience it. An arborist probably has the richer experience of the same walk in the woods and the artist has the richer experience of colours.  I always thought the labels were totally backwards in their thinking though. It makes more sense to describe what you like with androphilic & gynephilic than how what you like sits relative to you. The hetero/homo phrasing implies that you're observing the relationship, where as androphilic & gynephilic describe individuals and are therefore better terms for identity."

But sexuality/gender isn't a sickness, and I think that the more people try to compartmentalize their own particular coordinates on the spectrum, they lose sight of the fact that we are all human, and there is no ""normal"".

Having a label gives people a firm place to stand in the shaky and socially dangerous arena of sexuality.   I've often told friends that I have never liked guys, and as of yet, I'm perfectly 'straight', but who knows about the future? The immediate reaction from at least one friend is 'Maybe you're a closeted gay?'.

So some women born with the anatomy of a man is great at rugby. Some of them probably suck.   A man born with Sven the Viking's anatomy is going to be good at strongman competitions, a man born with Kobe's is going to be great at basketball, a woman born with Venus's is going to be a great tennis player. Not to subtract from the work all of them have to do to make the most of their anatomy.  I guess I don't see it as an 'unfair advantage' any more than I see it as unfair that I will never outrun Usain Bolt and no matter what training I had done since Day 1 of my life, I never would have done.   I'm assuming the game you're taking about was an amateur game? Amateur games often have massive disparities in skills, natural ability, effort, etc of their participants. In the worst case scenario here, where this woman dominates everyone and her team wins the championship, why is that a bad thing?"
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,firstLOL,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:26:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure if serious. The whole purpose of gender-segregated leagues is to normalize out the advantages/drawbacks of human sexual dimorphism. We may have socially agreed that gender is fluid and reassignable... but dimorphism is a thing -- it affects game balance and the opportunities available for individuals who want to play particular roles in team sports.  If you want to follow that thought experiment a little further down the road, consider simply abolishing sex-segregated sports. Everyone plays on a level playing field, etc.   What happens to sports where dimorphic characteristics give one sex an advantage over another?"
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,handshape,3,Sun Jun 28 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was serious, though I appreciate I'm probably underestimating the importance of ""game balance"" and the other things you mention. I'm not a huge sports fan or player and it's not a big hurdle for me to shrug my shoulders and say ""so what"" to a woman born a man dominating a rugby game at the park on Saturday mornings.  But to answer your thought experiment, I think within a few seasons, everything would just drift back to how it is now - women would organise into women's leagues, and men into men's leagues. Whether deliberately or because in most sports the men would dominate the upper leagues and women's teams would drop into the lower leagues, that would be the end result.  To be clear, I'm not arguing that dimorphism doesn't exist. I'm just saying I don't really care if a woman born a man wants to play rugby with the other women on a Saturday morning in Central Park. If some of the women drop out because it's no fun being dominated by a player with a genetic advantage, I don't really see that as any different from the Williams sisters showing up to a tennis club and dominating all women (and men) there. Genetic advantages are present within and across the sexes.  I also don't think there are anywhere near enough transgendered men or women out there to make a material impact on the world of professional sports.

Over time, these accusations have worn me down and eroded at my soul. I have found solace in others who identify as genderqueer and can understand my pain.

I'm pretty sure what gender I am.  I don't believe I have the perspective to tell everyone else what gender they choose to be.  I strongly suspect that the lack of descriptive pronouns pointlessly limits the discussion, because the binary male/female doesn't allow for subtle gradations.    Moreover as we accept more gender heterogeneity, there are fewer (if any) absolute clues to personal choice of gender.  There are men who ""act female"" who see themselves as female, and there are men who act in exactly the same way who see themselves as male."

Trans people are much more likely to be bullied and harassed based on their gender identity. The are more likely to be depressed. They are also at a high probability to be killed because of the fact that they are trans. These murders are often horrific in nature.

A lot of transphobia manifests as ""they're not real men/women"", so it's important for language not to make that distinction for us."

But little kids born with male genitals correcting even their parents about their gender makes me think otherwise.  Perhaps there is some part of the brain that says ""look at what people of your gender do and imitate that.""   And then of course there was that horrible doctor who told parents their little boys were daughters.  In regards to your part about wanting to live as cis, well I think society at large is starting to realize that there are gender-queer folk who like to experiment with their own gender identity.  I think society is also unsure of how these people fit in and thinks of them as trans, which I think is inaccurate."

TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,warmshower,11,Sat Jun 27 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"Well, when looking at gender dysphoria, it wouldn't seem to happen much outside of the west (and Iran, the country with the most sex change operations). In many places it is common for ""trans"" people to live as a sort of third-gender. The two-spirit people of the Native Americans, the kathoey of Thailand, the hijras of South Asia etc.   It would seem to me that gender dysphoria is a western ""problem"". In many other cultures it is completely natural for men or women to identify as the other gender and simply live like them, or like a third-gender without the need for hormones or sex change operations. Now why this is, I have no idea. Maybe the west has more strict gender roles and expectations? This would certainly explain why Iran has such high amounts of operations. A ""you're either male or female, no inbetween"" type of deal."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,stillwtnforbmrecords,3,Sun Jun 28 00:17:27 2015 UTC,"This would certainly explain why Iran has such high amounts of operations. A ""you're either male or female, no inbetween"" type of deal.   I thought that was more as a result of same-sex relationships because discouraged. What I've generally seen is, if you're in a same-sex relationship it is frowned upon, but you can rectify that by having one person transition to the ""other"" sex so that you're now not a ""same"" sex relationship. I hope that made sense. I think I used too many quotation marks."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,Kirioko,6,Sun Jun 28 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"I think maybe in Iran, gender roles are so strict (and homosexuality so oppressed, with homosexuals being executed even) that it is ""impossible"" for men to like men and women like women, unless they are transgender. So maybe through pressure and coercion homosexuals are made believe they are transgender, idk."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,stillwtnforbmrecords,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is the documentary I was thinking of. From the summary:       Although homosexual relationships are illegal (punishable by death) in Iran, sex reassignment operations are permitted. In 1987, Islamic leader Ayatollah Khomeini passed a fatwa allowing sex-change operations as a cure for ""diagnosed transsexuals"". Be Like Others shows the experiences of male and female patients at Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali's Mirdamad Surgical Centre, a sex-reassignment clinic in Tehran. One of them is Ali Askar, a 24 year-old man who faces harassment from other men due to his feminine appearance and behaviour. He does not want to become a woman but sees no other options for him in Iranian society. Throughout the film, the patients of the sex-reassignment clinic assert that they are not homosexual, seeing homosexuality as something that is shameful and immoral. Eshaghian's opinion is that this shame is the driving force behind so many Iranians deciding to change their sex. She says that identifying as transsexual rather than homosexual allows them to live free from harassment.   There's also the Wiki page on Transsexuality in Iran:      UNHCR's 2001 report says that sex reassignment surgery is performed frequently and openly in Iran, and that homosexual and cross-dressing people, although unrelated to transsexualism, would be safe as long as they keep a low profile.   ...Which seems to suggest that if you're gay, the best way to escape persecution in Iran is for a sex change operation."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,Kirioko,3,Sat Jun 27 22:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. I just meant that some people who are homosexual in Iran may actually believe they are trangender because of all the pressure and oppression. Your surrounding can have real deep effects on you."

TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,gotasugardaddy,3,Sat Jun 27 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've read that some do and some don't. But the kathoey are a historic class, from very much before hormone therapy and operations. What I mainly meant is that the idea of transgenderism as we see it not ""factual"". There have been many different ideas of gender in human history, what we have now is just that, what we have now.  Honestly, I believe the way the Native Americans and South Asians deal with this non-binary gender thing is much healthier. To me hormone therapy, sex change operations and overall the way we see and treat transgender people is very traumatic."

I actually kind of believe that some people might have their brains better wired for a particular hormone, though I'm not sure if there is any sort of scientific basis for that. When I got on estrogen I was just like 'wow, is this how other people feel all the time?' And I've felt the same way for over a year now. I can actually tell when I have more testosterone in my system (i.e. dosage problems) based upon how bad my mood is."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,gotasugardaddy,2,Sat Jun 27 23:15:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hormones really do impact behavior, for sure. Just how behavior can impact on hormones, being aggressive makes the body produce more testosterone than the other way around, for example). And I believe that if hormone therapy works for you, that's great, it really is. Being well with yourself is the most important thing for a healthy life.  I just think that, currently, we can't really tell if, like you say, if some people's brains are better wired for a particular hormone. In the way that hormone therapy will biologically fix something. I don't believe it, but maybe the way you improved was psychological. I believe male and female brains are different and that some people can be born with it their brains ""switched"". I don't believe it's that binary, but you get the idea. But what if people that get hormone therapy get better because of a sort of psychological ""placebo""? We can't say for certain that's not true.   And honestly, looking at these cultures and how they developed these things, it does seem that gender is not this binary and transgenderism is more mental than physical. You can be born a male but not be male and at the same time not need to be bodily female. I think this fluidity would be better than the current rigidity."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,stillwtnforbmrecords,5,Sat Jun 27 23:25:40 2015 UTC,"I went the other way, female to male. I was very depressed with estrogen in my system, but I had no idea that was why. When I started testosterone, I was afraid I would get aggressive, angry, surly. I certainly didn't expect it to change my mood, or mindset, at all. I knew my body would change, but I didn't expect my whole inner world to change.   I am the happiest person in the world, now. My confidence is sky high but I'm not cocky or competitive at all. I am the coolest cucumber and I never in a million years expected to ever be like this.   The changes I found about my body weren't the cause of this. I was thrilled with them, sure, but it's not the cause of my total flip of disposition. I'm living my dream of going through life as a man, but even your wildest dreams coming true can't make a chronically suicidal mindset evaporate like mine did.   There was something that clicked and all the lights inside flipped on with testosterone in me. I didn't expect it, and one day, three weeks after starting T, after the novelty wore off, I was this new happy person and it took me a while to notice how much better I was. Nine months later it's still the case. I move very quickly through life and last month is always years of difference to the next, but this radiant me is still here.   This is something a lot of Trans people will tell you after getting hormone therapy. They don't expect it, and it is entirely independent of the changes they notice in their bodies. Sometimes they don't notice any changes and are still bummed about how they look but suddenly holy shit they feel fantastic.   It's not placebo. It's very, very chemical. It's tangible and testable and measurable. You just can't know with this level of certainty until you go through it."

I was born female and identify as female by default. Throughout my life I've gone through different phases. I had short, ""guy"" haircuts and wore clothes solely from the boys section for years. I was almost exclusively friends with boys. And I can't count the number of times I was accused of being the wrong public locker rooms or called ""sir"" by strangers.   Now I'm a teenager and I have long ""girl"" hair. I wear women's clothes in neutral colors. I don't wear makeup or style my hair except for down or in a ponytail. I have mostly guy friends because I compete and work in a mostly male sport, but I also have plenty of female friends at school.   I don't get mistaken for a guy anymore. But I don't feel like a girl either. I don't understand how someone feels ""like a ____."" For example, if you're a sensitive or emotional guy, I don't think that should mean you identify as a woman. To me, that's enforcing untrue stereotypes. I am aggressive and tough. I'm uncomfortable with the feminine aspects of my body because they get in the way of my life. Does that mean I should have a sex change?   I think the fact I was born with a vagina means I am a woman. I lift heavy weights, I work on engines, I'm better at physics than poetry, I am always outside getting dirty. Those are all ""manly"" traits. But those are what make up my personality and my life. Because of my body, I'm a woman who does all those things. Stereotypically men are better at those things. By identifying as a man I'd be enforcing that stereotype.   I don't understand how or why people consider themselves a gender different from how they were born."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,Considerable,3,Sat Jun 27 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"See, for many people, identifying as the opposite gender isn't simply recognizing gender roles that they may embody and picking the gender most typically associated with such. Most transgender people experience what is called ""gender dysphoria,"" a condition of anxiety with the sexual attributes of their body, a condition not unlike other body dysphoria disorders not unlike anorexia nervosa. They physically feel uncomfortable viewing themselves as the gender they were assigned at birth, and this anxiety, coupled with societal pressures can often lead trans people to commit self harm or suicide."

My confusion is mostly: why claim the trans label if you don't have any dysphoria and you're purely based your gender identity on gender roles?

Why can't you just be a feminine man? Or a man who isn't conforming to some (or even all) behaviours that are expected to typically come from a man?   Hey, I'm a trans girl. Well, if I wasn't deathly afraid of surgeries, I probably would get GRS (genital reconstruction surgery). What I do do though is take hormones, finished voice therapy, do makeup / hair, and this causes people to treat me like a girl, which is surprisingly therapeutic for my gender dysphoria. Boobs make it kind of hard to see my schlong anyways so... yeah! Its like its not even there.  Some trans people may identify as a different gender, but then they are too afraid to act upon their identity. Obviously self denial isn't really a good way to live through life, but sometimes that is what it comes to. Some people think still having a family, being seen as normal, or whatever, is more important than their identity so they decide to stall transitioning or avoid it.  Then of course, there are people that identify as a different gender quite loudly and then don't do much about it. That I don't understand much either, because I decided to do something about my problems very quietly.    P.S.

I wear button-up shirts and jeans everyday. I lift weights. I play video games. I ride a motorcycle. I grew up on a cattle ranch and played football in high school.  But I don't do anything for the sake of being ""manly"". I do things that I like. And I don't care if those things are considered manly or feminine.  People should be what they wanna be, as long as they aren't hurting anyone.  And I don't really see the point in being transgender. We shouldn't be confining ourselves to templates.

For most transgender people, their gender hurts...which is a very bizarre thing to hurt, as most people don't think it's possible... including quite a few transgender folk...at least until they realize what actually is in pain.  To a certain extent, gender (in this case) is like a gall bladder or appendix: unless it is in pain, you usually take it for granted.  In most cases, hormones do the real work and are most of the ""cure"", while life experience and therapy mop up the ""PTSD"" of having lived in fear/shame so long, and possibly losing family, friends, security, livelihood, and home in the process.  Social acceptance for dress wearing men would be a great thing, and I believe would be indicative of the beginning of the end of the patriarchy (do not read this with hysterical feminist tones....it's not meant this way), or at least the bits where men are holding other men to unreasonable, impossible, and detrimental ""standards"".  A man should be able to be a fashion designer or an artist without being looked as as less manly.

TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,disgruntled_soviet,32,Sun Jun 28 03:04:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there, actual trans person checking in!  Gender is made up. What is perceived as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" or ""natural"" for men and women varies really widely, depending on where in the world you are and what point in history you're looking at.  This makes gender identity sort of complicated, but the main components are: 1. the gender you were assigned at birth, probably based on your external genitals 2. your feelings about your assigned gender and your culture's construct of gender 3. your feelings about your body  To use my own identity as an example: I was assigned female at birth, but that didn't sit well with me. I didn't like the physical characteristics I developed during puberty, so when I got the chance, I got surgery to be completely flat chested and went on testosterone for a little while.  Genders are really just a cultural template for people to follow.  In the west, we have ""man"" and ""woman"", and a set of expectations, stereotypes, and typical experiences that go along with those.  Some other cultures have more genders, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to speak about that.  Some people are happy to more or less follow the template, some people like to deviate from it a bit, and some others reject it all together.  Ultimately, it's your culture, so you can choose how you interact with it.  I don't identify with any gender because I feel like it's limiting and unnecessary. I'm what most people would consider androgynous and I'm completely comfortable with that.  My ideal would be to live in a world without genders, or one where gender didn't play a significant role in anything.  As for the ""special snowflake"" identities, I just see it as being creative with a cultural idea. It's not exactly my thing, but I won't begrudge anyone unless they're disrespectful about it. Example: a very dudely-dude who follows most gender expectation and gets the full privileged of being a gender conforming man (admittedly) identifying as a woman for shits and giggles. Or a white person identifying as ""two spirit"" or another culture specific identity without having any ties to or understanding of that culture.  EDIT: I gotta go to Dyke March, guys.

How is it anything other than a binary thing? Of course, there may be rare exceptions where something genetic happens that leaves people as somewhere in-between, or people may have surgery to change their gender, but I'm having trouble understanding how gender is just some non-existent construct, a perception, or something that is ""made up.""   I'm not trying to be a dick, to be clear, honestly trying to understand. My company will likely hire someone who is gender-queer (to be clear: I don't care what others try to to), and I want to understand what that means and how to be sensitive. It all seems very complex."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,jthommo,15,Sat Jun 27 21:59:06 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between gender and sex. Sex are the physical characteristics, the genitalia, hormones, and all the fun stuff that make people male, female, or intersex. On the other hand, gender is just the societal notion of what is expected of each sex, such that women should wear dresses and men should swing axes, that sort of thing. When we say that ""gender is made up,"" were referring to the social construct that is the gender binary and all the roles and expectations associated with such, while in reality there are numerous different genders and expressions of gender, which do not align with the sex based gender binary."

Gender isn't precisely made up, it's the behavioral expression of biological sex. There are outliers and those people for whatever ever reason differ from the norm to various degrees."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,the_rabbit_of_power,3,Sat Jun 27 17:51:00 2015 UTC,"It's the behavioral expression of sex in the context of society and culture.

The social and the biological are interconnected, humans are after all biological beings and the urge to be social itself is hard wired in the species."
TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,tianan,6,Sat Jun 27 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"It may well have come about ""naturally"" but that doesn't mean it's inherently good or acceptable, it's still made up because there is nothing which suggests it's wrong to not fall into the societal norm, and so we have a duty to accept and try to get others to accept people who go against this norm."

I'd also add not everyone has to like everyone, in the sense in my personal life I am not friends with any non normative people but wish them no ill will. Personally I think being normative is a bit more admirable but more importantly I'm not in the business of telling anyone how to live their life and no one should suffer things like job or housing discrimination.   When I say indifference I mean more social indifference but anyone should be allowed to prefer or personally admire any trait they wish. So I agree that social power is the big issue.  Ostracism isn't the answer, niether is removing anyone from the discourse. The discourse itself is the answer. The progress that has been made is due to discourse being allowed to happen and more not less people included in it."

Gender is a whole set of assumptions about your personality, opinions, and traits that aren't at all related to genitals. We make assumptions about what movies people will like, what stores they will shop at, what clothes they want to wear, and countless other things all based on gender.   But, there is nothing about having a vagina that makes one enjoy romantic comedies; instead, that's wrapped up in female gender. It's one of the assumptions that society makes about an individual based on an arbitrarily assigned category.  When people say that gender is made up, they aren't saying that there's no difference between penises and vaginas, biology says that there obviously is. They are saying that there's no reason one person can't like watching sports and wearing frilly dresses, and genitals don't have anything to do with either of those things.  All you have to do if your company hires someone gender-queer is find out their prefered pronouns so you can talk to them respectfully, and get to know them as a person. Maybe they'll like monster trucks, maybe they'll like knitting, maybe they'll like both and that's totally fine because everyone is different."

Maybe being white (or whatever you are) isn't a big part of how you think about yourself, but it does impact how other people see and relate to you.  It's like a form with 2 boxes on it, it's handed to us with one of them pre-checked and most of us leave it as is. Some people cross out the pre-filled in box and mark the other one. A very few people cross out what's already filled in and write their own option. If enough people start doing that, people will eventually stop caring about that section of the form.

They'd never have to worry about if they're ""man"" or ""woman"" enough again.

And also if my upbringing makes me think my face looks better with purple lines around my eyes.

It seems that they don't really get offended as long as you are understanding and don't make a big deal out of it when they correct you. In terms of actually determining their sex and gender, it is a bit of a messy area where you're walking the line between not being thorough and being offensive (imagine asking a heterosexual male what gender he is). The point is that many of them won't have any problem just correcting you and saying ""oh, I identify as female and I prefer the pronouns ""she"" and ""her"". No harm done, let's move on."

Although it helped us lay the foundations of our society, it is no longer required thanks to technology, information etc and I believe the idea of male vs female gender is now only really relevant to war and marketing. Facebook are updating their gender options constantly, as is the LGBTQWERTY label, which tells us what? People are all different. That's it.        That said, I refuse to pity those who mutilate their bodies out of fear of being judged, because as with most things, change comes from within, and you can't and shouldn't attempt to change what you were given for the sake of other people's perception of you.       Gay people, I believe, are the ""peacekeepers"" of our society, here to slow down the population and communicate on all levels with both sexes. It's a gift.

I think it should be perfectly OK to have a dissenting opinion on semantic matters, for example, as long as you're trying to see the other side.   On the other band, in real flesh-world I have had it come up in discussion way more than ever before and the dismissal as ""freaks"" or whatever has really faded away. People are starting to become more aware and, like homosexuality, I think more people are adopting the idea that even if they don't get it or don't like it, they should at least try to accept it.

TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're starting to understand the disconnect between sex and gender. However, I think you still have a few misconceptions that are clouding your view.   I'm agender (meaning, I don't identify with any gender), and here are my thoughts:  First, let me make a few clarifications:   Sex is your anatomy. A male person tends to produce semen that can impregnate a female person. A female person tends to have eggs that can be fertilized by semen to produce another human. Gender is a fundamental label that, by itself, means very little. Your gender is what you submit to a site when you make an account. Gender roles are the stereotypes and expectations that come with identifying as a gender. You identify as a man? If duty calls, it's your job to go to war and fight for your family (which you will have). You identify as a woman? It's your job to have children and prepare food for your family.   Not only are gender and sex different-- they have no relation. It is my opinion that saying they do is false causation. Male people usually identify as men. Female people usually identify as women.   Gender roles are society's most fundamental label. Sticker. Tag. Way of grouping the world's people. Realizing that sparked an epiphany. Gender roles are, like that podcast suggests, a completely arbitrary social concept. They have nothing to do with what does or doesn't dangle between your legs. They have everything to do with your place in society.   Despite that, people tend to assign gender roles to others based on physical sex. This makes sense. After all, secondary sexual characteristics exist, and create differences between male and female people.   Male people tend to be stronger than female people-- so you'd assign a label to the group that tends to be stronger. Among other things, this label collects the set of all children and adults who are expected to be able to excel at manual labor.  Among other thing Female people have the necessary parts to carry children. When a person is pregnant, they tend to be more vulnerable. So, it would make sense to assign them a label that, among other things, encourages them stay home and away from dangerous situations where they and their child (and thus, the society's next generation) might be hurt. Among other things, this label collects the set of all children and adults who are expected to birth children and raise the next generation.  These are gender roles. However-- what if a female person did not identify with the label 'woman' and all its implications? (And remember, these are just labels. They have nothing to do with your anatomy.)   Such a thing is only considered weird because we, from the moment we're born, are pounded with the message that, if we have a male body, we are boys, and we will become men, and we will be strong and able to fight. It takes a lot to break through that conditioning.  Personally, I think we've outgrown gender roles. Our civilization is a civilization. No hunter/gatherer style system. Our population is so large, and our society is so safe, it no longer makes sense to force people to play roles in society based on traits people like them tend to have.   If gender (not gender roles-- not the obligations, just the label itself) works for you-- if you find some sort of value in being a man, or being a women-- good on you --but gender roles that make it shameful for men to cry, and disgraceful for women to go to war-- those can go screw themselves in the ass."

I complicate things because I love traditionally feminine things. I love cute things and flowers, knitting and crafting, baking and cooking, clothing and feelings. When I was a girl (that's how I like to phrase it, because my growing up as a girl is very important to me from the perspective it gave me. Many Trans people would phrase it 'when I presented as my assigned gender' or the like) I identified as a lipstick lesbian, but it always felt wrong.   The femininity didn't feel wrong, the whole being a girl thing felt wrong. I've been steeped in LGBTQ+ community my whole life, but it took me until I was 22 to accept that I was trans, because I was so inherently gentle and flamboyant. I fit the female roll just fine, and I knew transition would only make it harder for me to fit in especially if I passed.   But my body was wrong. Being seen and understood as a girl by others felt wrong. Dressing up super feminine, even though I was very feminine in nature and I loved the make up and clothes, felt wrong. I felt like I was in drag. All the time. Just acting as a girl. I was being me, I was having a lot of fun with it, but... I was Eddie Izzard. I was a guy in a dress, and I loved the dress, but people thought it was a woman in a woman's dress. No, I was a man in a woman's dress, but it was my dress so it was a man's dress but all people saw was the woman and the dress.   I can't hope to explain this in a way that makes sense to people who are very solidly masculine men or feminine women.    Edit: hit send accidentally too early.   I wrote many stories, and I always wrote the main character as a self-insert but pretending it wasn't, because my lead was always male. A pretty, sensitive male who had a lot of feelings and was universally delicate. If there was a sensitive gentle male character in anything he would instantly be my favorite.   I wanted to pave the road for feminine male leads. I wanted that to be an established archetype without being the butt of a joke because I didn't believe I could ever be a man because I didn't cut down trees and rub engine grease in my beard.   I had a lot of trouble reconciling who I was with society. I still do.   For me, being trans never had anything to do with what's classically seen as appropriate gender rolls, or masculine and feminine bullshit. It 100% had to do with the fact that my body was wrong.   I wanted a deeper voice. I wanted a beard. I wanted to be a brother to my brothers, and a son to my parents. I wanted stronger stiffer muscles and to be taller. I WANTED A PENIS! And a flat chest!

TrueAskReddit,3bb6tf,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"What bothers me is that as medicine and science have paved the way legitimacy, the entire landscape of gender non-conformity has been re-written around trans identities. In the early 90's for dudes who dressed like chicks there were transvestite organizations. These were the most populous because they adhered largely to the argument ""I crossdress, but I am a MAN. I don't want to change my gender/sex, I just like wearing women's clothing.""    It used to be really weird if you admitted that you really felt like you were supposed to be a woman. This weakened the, ""I am just a MAN."" argument by suggesting not everyone felt that way, and it was generally viewed as being kind of down the rabbit hole. At this time trans people weren't yet people in the media, they were at best a scary story for straight worried about being lured into some gay shit so to speak.   Of course things are different these days. Gay marriage has just been legalized not only here in the US, but recently in other countries as well. Trans rights still have a long way to go but things feel a million miles away from where they were in the 90's.   Today though there exist a panoply of identities: genderfluid, genderqueer, metagender, and the list goes on. At a certain point we've begun to understand gender less as a box one fits into, than an innate expression of one's self. Your standard cis person may not think about this very much, and yeah that's privilege, but I don't blame people for not innately knowing a bunch of college level gender theory.   I feel like the trans wave has been li erating but perhaps it also constrains others a bit too. Both narratives seem to at once express something deeply personal to the people attached to them, while also driving toward legitimacy. Whatever happened to all of those MEN who dressed like women? Were they all just lying? I have trouble believing that. Where in the trans movement are the transvestites? It seems we are more willing to accept people as transgender, who ultimately reinforce the gender binary and gender based mores."

One thing we fail to understand is that these roles of sex and gender, which are essentially one in the same, exist on the mental plane and higher. If your mind and your body are not in unison, your body isn't what went wrong, it's your mind. I'm willing to bet that most folks who wish to identify as a different gender, or even want to realign their sexual desires, went through some traumatic experience involving sexual acts as a child.  Of course, we should make sure everyone is as comfortable as possible while they're existing (duh), but at the same time, we need to look further than ""oh your mind and body are completely backwards from each other? That's fine, have some rights that we took forever to alter."" There's an epidemic going on behind the scenes that no one wants to talk about, and no one knows about what's happening back there because every single person in the West is compartmentalized into a special snowflake, and need their issues known to none in the name of image preservation.

Any kind of choice can be informative to anyone who can make a diligent assessment without a bias. If you have the right set of skills, you can immediately deduct some or many personal attributes when you simply observe a person just for a few moments. In some RARE cases this could be more difficult and require more time to make this type of assessment.  To your specific case: when you see one person with a significant other, the amount of data at your disposal is significantly greater, especially if you get a chance to hear the couple converse. Assertiveness does not necessarily attract the meeker type as well as short people would often prefer a shorter SO to avoid the height contrast. These particular attributes do not provide specific profile information without additional correlation. It is important not to forget that visual features may be of little importance to some/many and their choices are based on various other factors that reveal specific traits in their personalities.

TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,NWAgh,250,Fri Jun 26 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"Background: inside the Reddit/university/young-person-culture bubble you're unlikely to come across many bona-fide social conservatives. But they really do exist -- on the order of 10s of percentage points of people oppose gay marriage (and similar), even in the most socially liberated countries in the world. But because you never come across these people in real life, you only ever hear the counter-arguments to their position, and in particular, really poor counter-arguments that are not intended to convert anyone from the socially-conservative side to the socially-liberal side, but are really attempts to signal to fellow social-liberals about their correct political opinions. So it's easy to assume that all social conservatives are one-dimensional homophobic villains and/or mindless sheep brainwashed by corporations and/or whatever other strawman springs to mind. But I try to be as charitable as possible towards others' positions, especially when they're the positions of very large numbers of people.  For a social conservative, marriage is a high-prestige activity. It's constantly celebrated and promoted, and is regarded as vital to furthering the existence of the local tribe (or nation-state, or ethno-religious subculture, etc.). This makes sense as it's a good cultural adaption -- communities which successfully promote sexual reproduction are successful in the long run, as they have more descendants. However, ""evolutionary success of entire culture"" is not a terminal value of most humans (at least not consciously) -- instead, the members of the culture carry around a bunch of memes that serve to reinforce certain behaviours, such as ""marriage is holy"", ""holiness is good"", etc.  To a social conservative, being homosexual is a low-prestige activity -- it may not be actively despised (cf the whole ""love the sinner hate the sin"" business), but it's not something that you want to be promoted or celebrated. The worry is that, if gay marriage is legalised, this will lower the overall prestige of marriage as an institution, so fewer members of the social conservative's culture will be drawn to it. This is what social conservatives mean when they say that ""the sanctity of marriage is under threat"" or whatever. They understand that legalising gay marriage will not force otherwise-straight people into gay marriages, or whatever other ridiculous strawman arguments you've probably heard frequently. So, ""if you don't like gay marriage, don't have a gay marriage"" is not a valid counter-argument to the social conservative's position.  As to why homosexuality is considered low-prestige in social conservative circles, that's a complicated question.

TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,MONEY_AND_POWER,8,Sat Jun 27 09:55:30 2015 UTC,"As an add on to this point. Conservative literally means to preserve or to remain unchanging.   In general conservatives are going to disagree with things that change the status quo. To many people the status is comfortable, it's a known quantity. If I like my life 'as it is', why would I support things that might make it worse? And don't kid yourself, for a lot of people the world with gay marriage is 'worse'. If you've been taught to believe that gays are evil, for decades, and you believe it to be true. What does today mean? Either everything you've been taught is a lie, or America is literally becoming the home of the devil. How could that be? I've grown up a good gay hating american, paying my taxes and raising my gay hating children right and now the government says everything I believe is wrong? It wasn't wrong 10 years ago, or 20, or 30. Why I can even remember when not long ago being gay was a crime and even the police might join us for a good old fashioned beating. Now I have to send reasonably price gift from 'bed, bath and beyond'? I don't think so.   Sorry got off on a tangent, please don't think the preceding paragraph represents my personal views.  There's a reason that more old people are conservative and more young people are liberal. The older you get the more defined as a person you become. The more comfortable you become in your skin and in the world you've created. The club you visit never had blacks, why would I want blacks now? I've never had to hire a woman, why would I hire one now? I've never had to think about the moral implications of gay marriage before, why would I want to open up that moral quandary now? Now for businesses they're generally even more risk adverse and any large social changes may affect their business model. So if they're successful they'll instinctively fight against change on the off chance it will cause a profit dip (of course it must be said that many companies fought for gay rights for years, including Apple and Disney).  So that's why. Change is scary for a lot of people especially if they're already satisfied with the status quo."

TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,Denny_Craine,2,Sat Jun 27 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"I like that this was posted. On the other hand, here is essentially what I extrapolated from this assessment:  Social conservatives tend to see social institutions as something removed, distanced, external from society. The sanctity of marriage is a ""higher concept."" It exists outside from society and individuals achieve greater 'prestige' -- as in, some people are intrinsically better than others -- through working towards a set-in-stone external ideal. ""It's like that because it's always been like that and so it's bigger than us.""  Conversely, those who oppose that socially conservative viewpoint tend to see social institutions as reflections of society. These institutions are cultural products -- they're something we created to make our lives within our societies more enjoyable or easier. ""This is something we made, that we all interpret differently, and I wish to interpret it my way.""  I see more intellectual merit in the latter viewpoint.  Do you agree with that assessment?"
TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,highbrowalcoholic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't believe in external ideals, and I do believe in making lives more enjoyable and easier (i.e. utilitarianism), so in that sense I agree with the latter viewpoint. However, I don't think that marriage (or other societal institutions) originally came about for utilitarian reasons, but more as a natural way of helping societies to survive. That said, technological progress means there's easily enough food/resources to go around, so we can definitely allow an expanded definition of marriage, increasing utility for gay people, without threatening the future of society."

Liberalism often assumes materialistic motivations oddly in conservatives where there aren't.   It's a matter of meaning, anything without some essential component that is not fully against it's tradion becomes a meaningless act. It's not that marriage losses it's prestige it's the marriage ceases to be marriage. It's not the benefit of the thing, but the thing ceasing in some sense to exist and being replaced by something different which just happens to share it's name and legal benefits."
TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,the_rabbit_of_power,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:39:53 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm the other way around. I'm assuming people engage in marriage because they want to get married, and then they want to attach social prestige to their desired action by maintaining an exclusivity about it.  Similarly, to illustrate further, I assume people get tattooed because they want a tattoo. After that they attach special significance to it by getting their own unique tattoo.  To define something by what it's not allowed to be to anybody else is inherently silly. There's a huge lack of awareness that others interpret concepts and ideas and institutions and rituals differently, from individual to individual. To create an interpretation in one singular person's mind of something and then blanket-apply it over every other interpretation from everybody else is restrictive, obstinate and authoritarian.   Alternately, stretching the definition of something so that it may be interpreted in many different forms and still fit into the legal infrastructure that we already had in place, allows for each individual definition of marriage to co-exist.  Let's say Alan owns a cargo truck and Bill owns a pick-up truck. When Bill calls his vehicle a truck, it isn't insulting the truck-like qualities of Alan's vehicle. It's one word that means two different things to two different people. One vehicle is a truck. The other vehicle is also a truck. They are two different vehicles. Similarly, if Clarissa and David get ""married,"" that's one ritual that expresses the love between Clarissa and David, and Clarissa and David alone. They have a ""Clarissa and David marriage."" If Esther and Faye get ""married,"" the idea that a ritual declaration of love between Esther and Faye somehow perverts the love between Clarissa and David is, well, it's logically absurd. If Clarissa and David never knew about Esther and Faye, if they lived in a bubble where they didn't know how other people did stuff outside, would it make a difference? Clarissa and David have their definition of marriage which they don't know extends to anybody else and they're just fine with it. Let's go one further: if a remote tribe in the jungles of Columbia allowed marriage between two people of the same gender, does that cheapen Clarissa and David's marriage? Let's say Clarissa and David have tattoos and piercings and attend aggressive music shows, and Esther and Faye like trying new recipes, enjoy gardening and listen to Beethoven. The cultural differences between those three marriages are large enough that each definition of 'marriage' becomes pretty culture-specific. Sure, Esther and Faye and Clarissa and David might live in the same country -- but if Clarissa and David live in Southern Florida and Esther and Faye live in Washington State, rip away the border lines and Clarissa and David's marriage is further away from Esther and Faye's marriage than the tribe of Columbia. Sure, they might speak the same language, unless Clarisa and David down in Florida speak Cuban Spanish with each other and Esther and Faye speak English up in the Pacific North-West.  Is my point illustrated? There is no, there has never been, and there will never be one concrete definition of any concept, idea or philosophy, that is applied universally to every single person anywhere. Saying that marriage was at one point, and now that the legal definition of marriage has been extended, it is no more, is categorically false."
TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,highbrowalcoholic,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"A thing is it's definition, if it is not it's definition it is a seperate thing. At this point though we will just go in circles about semantics because that's the trap or cultural relativism.  Again it's not about prestige. Liberals assume conservatives have the same motivating factors and goals. I see this fairly often, so what might motivate them then assume motivates the people they are debating (i.e. prestige, lack of information, I've heard the argument you've outlined many times before).  You wouldn't call a bicycle a truck. You also wouldn't call an orange a truck, there is something that categorically makes something a truck, there are different varieties but there are things that are by their various attributes not a truck. The boundaries of the definition is a great part of it's meaning.  What makes marriage, marriage is not love. The one central thing for it to be marriage is there is a man and a woman, or some combination of opposite sexed people. The same way a truck must at least be a sort of motor vehicle and a truck that no longer works is still more of a truck than a bicycle that has a basket and transports goods.  A broken truck is equivelant to an awful dysfunctional marriage, the bicycle is say a loving gay ""marriage"". It may preform the same functions in many ways better than the actual marriage, in what a marriage sets out to do but it is still not a marriage.  If in a remote village the term truck is borrowed to refer to any object that moves goods from one spot to another, from a well barrel to a basket, we wouldn't claim that they a referring to the same thing as we say when we mean truck. The basket is not the same thing, but rather a completely seperate thing that happens to share the same word.   If you think that the meaning is culture specific than civil unions for all is the valid solution rather than forcing people to acknowledge gay ""marriage"" as legitimate by using the legal label. It is the option that actually allows people to freely interpret what marriage is.  As for infrastructure the only difference would be terminology, it would not require a overhaul of any system. In fact here the people enforcing an interpretation are those who demand homosexual ""marriage"" be recognized as marriage.  Everyone getting civil unions was the reasonable comprise. It is the most authoritative, rather than either leaving it up to the states or getting rid of marriage as a legal term."

It's just one word that's only for heterosexuals. What's the point in that?  Marriage and civil unions are exactly the same thing. You can get married or civilly united any way you want. Everybody's been freely interpreting marriage since marriage started being around. It's still just two people loving each other. It's just the former has a different name. Like you said, let's not go in circles about semantics -- just call the whole thing what it is -- a union between two people. A marriage. Then you have the option that anybody can freely interpret marriage however they wish.  So alright, forget any notion of ""prestige."" Forget any notion of motivation to get married. Here's the question gay marriage advocates need answering:  Why will denying one word -- a word -- to a particular group of people maintain the solidarity of an arbitrary individually-interpreted concept for another particular group of people -- especially when the only thing that's different between the two groups is sexuality, with countless other things in common?"

That allows the whole freedom of definition you want without forcing people to have the definition of marriage gay people seem to want it people to believe it is.  Love isn't what makes a marriage. There are many many loveless marriages, they are still marriages.   Because the issue of sex is the defining trait of marriage.

If the politicians want their vote he/she best stay static in their anti-gay-marriage view. Moreover, this may be why Hilary was against gay-marriage; she knew it would kill a large percentage of the vote.    So, even if the conservative is questionably ""Christian"" (G.W.

TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,Soccermom233,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"So your  entire argument boils down to this - gays will ruin marriage for straight conservatives.  That sounds oddly similar to past arguments against interracial marriage, and yet straight people still get married today. Frankly, what your whole argument shows is that social conservatives are overly interested in the lives of other people, and base their whole reality on these perceptions. We are supposed to believe that gays are going to make marriage less appealing, but not celebrities who get married and divorced within hours, not people who are on their fifth marriage, not people who got married by Elvis in Vegas, not the fact that a huge number of marriages fail...  This whole argument is so artificial and constructed it's just ridiculous. Assigning some imaginary 'prestige' to an activity that is completely personal and private is just a cheap way to make bigotry sound intellectual. Gay marriages will not affect anything in the personal lives of straight people, not any more than interracial marriage, or divorces, or children born out of wedlock. If conservatives really are getting married solely on the value of that institution, then they are marrying for bad reasons. It's supposed to be a way of cementing your love for your spouse, not a contribution to some abstract social construct."
TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,huxtiblejones,2,Sat Jun 27 11:03:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds oddly similar to past arguments against interracial marriage   Well, yes, it's precisely analogous to arguments against interracial marriage, that's exactly the point. If you think that non-white people are low-prestige and bad, then letting white people and non-white people get married is bad because a) it assigns higher value to non-white people, and b) it might cause people to think less of marriage because non-white people are now involved in it.   We are supposed to believe that gays are going to make marriage less appealing, but not celebrities who get married and divorced within hours, not people who are on their fifth marriage, not people who got married by Elvis in Vegas, not the fact that a huge number of marriages fail...   I imagine that social conservatives also disapprove of all of the above, and in particular they would blame the last one on feminism (etc.) causing people to turn away from traditional gender roles.   This whole argument is so artificial and constructed it's just ridiculous. Assigning some imaginary 'prestige' to an activity that is completely personal and private is just a cheap way to make bigotry sound intellectual.   This debating tactic is one I really disapprove of. It's one thing to say you disagree with the premises, or the reasoning behind someone else's argument. It's quite another to say that their entire argument is somehow a priori illegitimate, because you can assign magic words like 'bigotry' or 'cheap' to it. You'll never convince anyone of your position that way; all you've done is signalled to those people already on your side that you have the same opinions as them, and so they should regard you as a high-status person.   Gay marriages will not affect anything in the personal lives of straight people   As I covered in the OP, this is not a valid counter-argument to what social conservatives actually say about gay marriage.   If conservatives really are getting married solely on the value of that institution, then they are marrying for bad reasons. It's supposed to be a way of cementing your love for your spouse, not a contribution to some abstract social construct.   'Love for your spouse' is one of your terminal values; other people have other terminal values. This is why they disagree with you on various political issues."
TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,ejlilley,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:22:05 2015 UTC,It's not exactly analogous. The legal arguments against interracial marriage was that it was an immoral marriage. However that argument against gay marriage is that it isn't by definition  marriage since it lacks the basic requiste of people of the opposite sex being involved.
TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,the_rabbit_of_power,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"Also as a conservative who has debated this on reddit, part of it comes from what is and isn't marriage.   Many on the left believe the definitions of things are based on feeling so marriage = love, rather than marriage is by definition required to have members of the opposite sex because that has been a rather universal component, more than love in fact.  So it's not even being against gay marriage as by definition such a thing is an oxymoron.  One could ask on the flip side why the comprise of everyone gets civil unions and marriage was no longer used in legal terminology was rejected by the gay community?"

To add on to it (and I wonder if you would agree), another factor that social conservatives consider (and this was mentioned in Robert's dissent) is that once you allow gay marriage, there is basically no grounds to deny polygamy.  Simply take virtually every gay marriage argument and replace the words ""same sex couple"" with ""couple of three, or four, or five...or any number""   Social conservatives resist change to the marriage definition for the reasons you mention and fear that the term will get further eroded as time goes on, and they have been fearing this ever since the divorce epidemic in this country.    Some liberals like to create a straw man argument that conservatives think people ""want to marry animals"" but most conservatives I know don't really believe that.  They have a belief in the nuclear unit of the family - that is they believe that the family is the best way, ""the way God intended"" and the most diverse biological way to bring up kids and that successful marriages form the underpinning and strongest foundation of successful civil society."

TrueAskReddit,3b8ch1,Catabisis,2,Sat Jun 27 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"Your article is absurdly ignorant...    What’s noteworthy about this is that the removal of homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses was not triggered by some scientific breakthrough.  There was no new fact or set of facts that stimulated this major change.   and then    The APA claimed that they made the change because new research showed that most homosexual people were content with their sexual orientation, and that as a group, they appeared to be as well-adjusted as heterosexual people.   So yeah, there were new facts that pushed the change. The author then says ""I don't believe them, I think it was about saving face!"" Well congrats on what you think, but science and psychology isn't run by what one writer thinks, it's based on observation and trials and both of these things shows new facts.  It was once a fact that blacks were not equal, then all of a sudden they were, it's not like we had some sort of absolute proof that blacks were equal, we just observed and through trials and observation it became clear that the whole ""blacks are beneath us"" absurdity was a lie based on ignorance. Same with homosexuals.   For centuries, perhaps millennia, homosexual people had clung to their sexual orientation despite the most severe persecution and vilification, including imprisonment and death.  Wouldn’t this suggest that they were happy with their orientation?  Do we need research to confirm this?   Apparently many people do. That's what the psychologists said in changing this theory. ""Ooops! We were wrong! We thought they were all mentally deranged and now we see they are fine and if allowed to live a normal life without vilification and hatred, they are perfectly normal people.""   And if we do, shouldn’t we also need research to confirm that heterosexual people are happy with their orientation?   They repeatedly said they were in protests and in sessions.    Also noteworthy is the fact that the vote of the membership was by no means unanimous.  Only about 55% of the members who voted favored the change.    45% were, like you, stuck in the past. It's pretty common for most big changes in societal values and ideas. The traditionalists drag their feet until their generation dies off and then everyone carries one and the idea becomes common sense.    So all the people who had this terrible “illness” were “cured” overnight – by a vote!   Wrong. The psychologists were more knowledgeable over night, by a vote. When it was shown that lightening was not from Angry Gods, that didn't kill the Angry Gods over night, it proved that the Angry God theory was wrong since the beginning of time and we are getting smarter.   Real illnesses are not banished by voting or by fiat, but by valid science and hard work.   Agreed completely. Hence proving that Homosexuality is not a real illness."

I guess that depends if your only definition of liberty is the right to travel and settle freely. In my opinion it isn't and clearly in the opinion of most of the judges it isn't either.   Thomas went on to write that one's liberty and dignity should be shielded from the government — not provided by it.   True, and that's why marriage should have nothing to do with the government. But while the government maintains absolute control of the right to marry than they are the ones who provide it and it must be provided equally.  I agree the Supreme Court should have had nothing to do with this case, it should never have needed to go to the Supreme Court because what kind of mentally ill person would stop someone else from loving who they want and marrying those they love?"

The reason being breeding strong families helps foster a better society, for biological and social reasons. Bad areas in America tend to have serious family dysfunction. I respect that people can have relationships with whoever they like, man or woman, or even multiple if they want, no harm done; but if we are trying to create a better society, it shouldn't be endorsed by the government.

Conservative politicians support policies that appeal to this form of Christianity (pro-life, against gay marriage, family values, etc) in order appeal to conservative voters, and gain votes for office thereby. Corporations make major ""donations"" to politicians in order to pass laws that are in said corporation's best interest.  So, in a sense, there is corporate interest in keeping gay marriage illegal. If certain politicians are willing to accept donations in exchange for laws benefiting certain corporations, and these politicians oppose gay marriage to appease conservative voters, then legalization of gay marriage means that these politicians (and by extension, these corporations) lose a powerful tool for manipulating votes.

As for your second question...yes transgendered people can get married. Was that news to you? No, a goat cannot marry because non-humans cannot consent.   It's in the state's interest to keep it to two people, for legal purposes, so that's why the number is two. Can a dad marry his daughter? I'm not sure if they can legally, but if they're consenting adults I don't see what's morally wrong with it. Perhaps you could argue that the natural power dynamic would mean it's automatically coercion."

Who gets to decide if you live or you die when you're in a coma? If there's no limit to how many people you can marry, the wealthy could marry all of their friends or children and avoid gift/estate taxes. There are a lot of complicated issues that are extremely difficult to deal with if there is more than one other person in a marriage.   Additionally, polygamous societies tend to mean wealthy or powerful men with many wives, and poorer or less powerful men with no wives. A large number of single men is a recipe for violence, as single men perpetrate crimes disproportionately to any other demographic. It's generally a cause of instability for society, which is why the state has a vested interest in monogamy."

TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,SublaciniateCarboloy,17,Thu Jun 25 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"School systems are almost a component of a larger, societal system. By that I mean that people such as employers and universities know what to expect from kids who went through traditional schooling. Employment positions and upper-level schooling are gradually developed to be compatible with that particular kind of experience. Some might argue that there are more efficient ways to educate kids, but in the larger picture, traditional schooling is probably the safest option.  In the U.S. at least, there are also some non-public schools that try to address issues that people often have with traditional schooling (for example, keeping closer track of students' growth and progress). Some are private schools, some are experimental state-funded programs that require interviews. Both usually cover grades 6-12. You might consider looking into what is offered in your area.  Public schools might not be the best, but they're pretty well rounded. Another option would be to supplement  public schools with tutoring (to not get behind in school), camps (outdoor activities. More socially-oriented than school), clubs (learn to interact with others while developing a hobby), or community service (new hands-on experiences. Teaches kids to appreciate work without material recompensation. Other volunteers are often friendlier than classmates or co-workers)."
TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,spudtaters,50,Fri Jun 26 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"viable options in terms of what to do with your kid from ages 5-18   ...That's not what schools are for, you know that right?  They're not a place to store children so you can go do grown-up things with your weekdays.    The idea is that your kid has a shitton of things they need to learn before adulthood, and it's impractical for a parent to take time out of their own lives to teach each kid directly so we instead pay someone to be good at teaching children and then have them teach lots at once.    A simplistic explanation, my apologies if it seems patronizing, but if we lose track of the goal behind putting kids into school - well, we could go back a hundred years or two and put 'em in the factories instead?  Or maybe just let them run loose and play up until they're twelve or so, then they're an adult straight into the workforce.    So ... assuming the goal remains the same, and ""alternatives to the school systems"" is ruling out the so-called ""alternative school systems"" as ""school systems,"" what remains would be homeschooling or some sort of educational collective.  We still want our kids to enter adulthood, if not ""advantaged"" per se, at least not at a disadvantage compared to their peers.  I've also seen ""unschooling"" as another new-age school alternative, but most of those kids seemed to be missing a lot of fundamentals of everyday stuff, so I'm not really convinced that your average young teenager has the drive to provide all the education they'd need to compete in the workforce from a self-directed program.    And ultimately, without vastly reducing the burden of knowledge we place on young people entering the workforce, they have to get that somewhere.    There's all sorts of things broken about most educational systems around the world, but specific failures within individual systems doesn't mean that giving up on all forms of institutionalized education is inevitable when really there's no ""better"" option.    Even once we can download knowledge right into brains ... The kids are probably still going to be drilled and tested to make sure they're comfortable applying their newly-downloaded knowledge and make sure it's stuck correctly and the like.  Even modern education has shifted in response to the accessibility of information online, for instance by drilling usage, applications, and theory rather than focusing on rote memorization of things you can now look up."

TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,lichorat,22,Fri Jun 26 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"It is important to note that while most schools have some aspect of memorization as part of their curriculum, memorization is still an important tool in any intellectual pursuit. The very basics of nearly every subject requires a base level knowledge of certain things, and students who miss these have to be caught up. This means that a good chunk of teaching ends up being dedicated to trying to consistently keep the entire class at a certain level of base knowledge. If that makes sense."
TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,AngryRootB33r,-9,Fri Jun 26 03:06:31 2015 UTC,I disagree. That's what encyclopedias and Google are for. If we really needed to know it we could work it out from there.

TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,lichorat,19,Fri Jun 26 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"That's absurd. If you think you never have to memorize anything because ""that's what encyclopedias are for"" then you don't understand learning. You'll never achieve mastery at any school subject without a decent amount of memorization. You can't learn to speak a foreign language without memorizing words. You'll never be able to do advanced math if you haven't memorized formulas. Even something as simple as memorizing times tables is vital when you're doing higher math. Not having basic things memorized slows you down and wastes your time when you are trying to understand something more complex.  The problem that you are trying to identify is that memorization is not enough. It should only be one small aspect of education. Memorization should be used as a tool to help students reach a deeper understanding of concepts, and more emphasis should be put on critical thinking. At one time, memorization was a huge focus of education, even at universities. But if you look at modern education, you'll see this has actually been changing a lot in recent years."

Apprenticeships means that I learn how to achieve a goal without arbitrary limits placed like multiplication. Regardless this is a valid alternative."

If you're in the middle of a discussion at work and your boss asked you a question about something that someone in your position should know, you can't just answer ""I don't know - let me google that"".  Not only is that the fast track to falling behind your peers, but do it enough and you'll eventually be out of a job.   Or at home, when you're simultaneously trying to cook, watch 2 kids, and make an important phone call. Good look googling how long to roast the chicken for without overcooking it.   Learn.

No, not all schools are able to provide a quality education but the system in itself is not as flawed as people make it out to be.  The one thing I would change is the lenght of the school day, or 4 days of school a week or something like that. Extra-curricular activities are very important for children and that would give them more time. They would also get more time with their families which children don't get enough of in my opinion.

TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,shawnaroo,2,Fri Jun 26 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define school. Other than the conventional schooling system, possible alternatives include sending a child to varying workplaces to acquire skills, sort of like apprenticeships that slowly increase in responsibilities until a job is rewarded or something.  You could also have this homeschooling system which is a little different to the current school system - online education or a decentralized learning network could also be seen as viable alternatives. You could also just have the parents do whatever they want with their kids.   For kids 5-18, some form of education whether in traditional schooling, high-tech schooling or whatever must take place. Children aren't born knowing everything you need to know to survive so things must be taught in some form - if school is a place where you learn, then there is no alternative (imo)"

I had a shit education but most people don't realize that since I read alot, I learned much more academically out of school. I think hopefully were understand individual differences better and not search for a universally optimal system. It also depends on a person's goal.   Not all young people want to live the same life, I think we currently in some ways have a more narrow view of ""appropriate life goals"".

If your child is intelligent and well-trained, or at least simply obedient? Send them to private school.  If they're intelligent and rebellious, but out of your control? Send them to Montessori. They'll have structure and freedom. It'll allow them to learn without inspiring them to say ""fuck school"" completely.  Home school is useful if you, yourself (the parent), is intelligent (like, actually) and have time to spare. This way you're capable enough to supplement their social life with group meetings (as to not create a socially awkward human), but also perceptive enough to teach them with a focus on both their weak points and their strengths. Most people think of home school and think of those weird half-christian half-new age people who end up with a child who is both arrogant and awkward. It is not an option for all families. It is important to realize your own strengths and weaknesses before guiding another human being in theirs.

Can you imagine how hard it would be for students to make friends if there was a big age gap? I could imagine it would make students feel extremely out of place and relatively isolated. Not good for their mental state and probably overall detrimental.  Having segments of difficulty is definitely a good idea, though. In my primary school, we had different (physical) tables for difficulty. It was a good idea, and certainly, it'd have been a mistake to give every student the same work to do. In high school, we had segmented maths classes (1 through 10), based on skill, though not really for any other subjects I can think of.  In short: this is largely done already to some extent, but you should recognise that age should almost always group students. Going too far and having ages too mixed could be harmful to the mental state of students, especially outliers (on either end)."

Without some sort of education system (ie schools), children won't learn. And I'm not saying that knowing 2+2=4 is all they need. They need social interaction of some sort, and different ways of learning different topics.   Is there a way to change the educational system and the way schools are set up? Yes. As others have stated already, there are many good options such as homeschooling, Montessori, online, and traditional schools. The key thing to think about is doing what is best for each particular student. What works for Student A probably won't work for Student B."

The curriculum is constantly changing, and no matter what the world looks like in 100 years, kids are still going to need to learn.   If your issue is more with the quality of schools in your area, that's a separate problem, because any public alternative is going to suffer from the same quality problems."
TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,junkit33,0,Fri Jun 26 10:55:35 2015 UTC,"""No one will doubt that the legislator should direct his attention above all to the education of youth; for the neglect of education does harm to the constitution. The citizen should be molded to suit the form of government under which he lives. For each government has a peculiar character which originally formed and which continues to preserve it. The character of democracy creates democracy, and the character of oligarchy creates oligarchy; and always the better the character, the better the government.   Again, for the exercise of any faculty or art a previous training and habituation are required; clearly therefore for the practice of virtue. And since the whole city has one end, it is manifest that education should be one and the same for all, and that it should be public, and not private- not as at present, when every one looks after his own children separately, and gives them separate instruction of the sort which he thinks best; the training in things which are of common interest should be the same for all. Neither must we suppose that any one of the citizens belongs to himself, for they all belong to the state, and are each of them a part of the state, and the care of each part is inseparable from the care of the whole. In this particular as in some others the Lacedaemonians are to be praised, for they take the greatest pains about their children, and make education the business of the state.""  *Aristotle, Politics VIII  Since we as a collective have a common interest to proliferate the types of education best suited to form ideal citizens, we have an obligation to standardize that type of education that we find optimal."
TrueAskReddit,3b44eu,AhSpagett,0,Fri Jun 26 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty big MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) enthusiast, having taken 20+ courses across edX, Coursera, and Udacity.  It's such a great way to deliver educational content to people, and is one step closer to individualized education.  I'm not confident that MOOCs are effective from ages 5-18, at least not yet.  That said, I remember talking to a 14-year-old in India would took, passed, and aced literally every single MIT class offered on edX on top of his school studies.  For him, I would argue that he received extraordinarily more value than the traditional school system.  We've come a long way from recording 60-min lectures on OCW to studies on how shorter videos improve engagement pdf.  I think what's interesting is that in the old ""stand-and-deliver"" model, you can only ever teach or talk at a pace right for a select few students.  For 49% percent, it's too fast, and for another 49%, it might be too slow.  In many ways, it's not quite a better or even replacement, but I really think it's a step in the right direction.  I'm very interested in how data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning might one day produce highly individualized education.  There's an interesting video from CGP Grey that touches on some of these points.  I imagine in 100 years, we would have virtual tutors and teachers that teach at YOUR pace and answer your questions and check your learning, all while also learning from a massive trove of data on how to best teach you."

I'd like it if homeschooling would work, but I'm skeptical, mostly because of resource concerns. Homeschooling requires a lot of attention from at least one parent, yet an increasing number of households need both parents in the workforce just to maintain their standard of living. They don't have the time/resources to devote to full-time homeschooling. To say nothing of single parents and other non-traditional households.  Perhaps this speaks more to other socioeconomic issues, but barring a huge shift in the way we think about employment, homeschooling probably won't be more than a niche solution."

He's a successful businessman who just hopped into politics.  But unlike the most of them, he's got something special: he's also the mogul of Quebec's biggest media empire.  We're talking several major newspaper publications, a major news website, a major TV station, a triple-play communications company, DVD rentals, publishing house, and media retailer among other things.  While he is nowhere near as outrageous as Donald Trump, and not corresponding to the classical profile of a 'joke candidate', he nonetheless is making waves in the political scene over here in some controversial ways.  There have been some long talks about the possible conflict of interest made by a media mogul getting involved into politics - in the end he was told ""give up your company shares or give up politics, you can't do both at once"".  He chose the former.  A bunch of people said that the whole deal could only end in disaster and there was no way in hell a guy like him could hope to run a political party, let alone the entire province - his line of thinking and methods were oftentimes in direct conflict with the party he had joined.

Once you're in that mindset, it's easy to see yourself as the person being victimized, or the person who needs to fight/defend/attack against this evil force, and it dehumanizes the people you hate.  So now you have this situation where a person is so mired in his own hate for a group that he's/she's convinced that they are acting as a whole, and they hate his/her kind as well. In their mind, there's a powder keg about to go off. (And I've heard that statement from other Neo-Nazi and KKK members as well). Also, it's easy to over simplify and justify the reaction after seeing what happened in Ferguson, Baltimore, etc. This line of thinking is echoed throughout extremist organizations, and is even the main plot line to The Turner Diaries, an anti-government fictional account of a man inciting a war with the United States, and an overall race war. Pages from this book were found on Tim McVeigh when he was caught.  Other attempts to start a ""race war"" have happened, and have been pretty much met with the same result.

More than once, I've been momentarily surprised that what I thought was a majority opinion (on Reddit) was actually minority opinion in ""real life"".

Just think: The debate over whether slavery was morally right or not was ongoing for over a century.  Over a hundred years to make a decision on slavery.

Is it because there was no ambiguity in the morality of his actions, as there has been with some of the police violence — I saw it posited in the aftermath of Ferguson that ambiguous instances of injustice tend to cause more controversy, and thus hostility. Perhaps it has something to do with the media's immediate and resounding condemnation. It could even be that people are simply tired of outrage.  I'm not trying to say the public reaction to the shooting hasn't been logical — only that it is interesting that the reaction has been so much more subdued than it could have been."

I think the point is that this isn't injustice.  Justice will be served. He (allegedly) committed a crime and is going to be punished (if found guilty).  Similarly, the case of Walter Scott, which also happened in Charleston, didn't have any major protests or outrage.  Why?  The police offer was immediately fired and charges were filed.  Justice.  In Ferguson, the case of Eric Garner and others, there was no justice (real or perceived).  The perpetrators were police and they got off without any repercussions.  Perhaps in the Ferguson case the office was right and therefore justice was properly served.  But the event served as a rallying cry; it became bigger than the case of Michael Brown, it was about the collective systematic injustice the citizens of Ferguson had endured over many years."
TrueAskReddit,3azffn,CuilRunnings,7,Wed Jun 24 21:46:36 2015 UTC,"A few things here.  First, there is no injustice here.  There was a heinous crime, the primary suspect was caught and he is currently going through the 'process' to determine guilt or innocence.  He is not being coddled and is not being given special treatment by 'the system'.  Secondly, he does not represent a larger institution.  If he were a cop that doesn't get immediately arrested followed by special treatment and a seemingly incompetent attempt at indictment - in that scenario there would be massive riots.  Honestly though I have a hard time imagining even the governor getting away with something like this.  Ferguson has a lot of real and perceived injustice (see the Justice Department Report).  Hence, yet another perceived injustice, we have demonstrations and riots.  At a large scale, there is still a racial divide in America.  As individuals, we can and do overcome it and bridge that gap.  As a culture, we still have a ways to go. The most visible example of it today is in communities that are mostly black yet policed by predominately white police corps.  It's places like that (Ferguson) or in seemingly corrupt cities where cops act with impunity (Baltimore) where we see tensions erupt into full-blown riots.  The individual act of hate here is not a symbol or example of the real racial problems that affect most people today.  If anything, his actions have caused more people to reach across race and seek understanding and offer comfort.  Maybe it can be one of the catalysts that help us fully heal as a society."

Now, as people in a group we tend to toss out our individual beliefs and start to go with the mob. Something deep within our psychology makes is prone to that mob mentality. Whether or not we're in an actual mob doesn't matter. If I only seek out and associate with white supremacists, I'll always just knee jerk hate all minorities. It's comfortable and safe.

Darren Wilson could have avoided killing Michael Brown, obviously, but it's also quite clear that he had been assaulted before he opened fire. It's unclear what his mental state was at the time - whether he was shooting because he was a racist who hated blacks, or if he felt genuinely threatened, or if he was taking the option that allowed him to get revenge for being punched in the face. Those are very important aspects of the situation that matter a lot for how people should respond.

For whatever reason, most people reach adulthood lacking several basic cognition skills:   They do not understand a proper relationship beyond cause and effect. And while there are all sorts of thought exercises and paradoxical physics examples, I'm not talking about those (you don't get points off if you can't figure those out). Instead, I mean that if you ask them to tell you what follows ""A"", even after you've just told them ""B"" follows ""A"", they can't do it. Any apparent success is them parroting words with no comprehension of the principle. They do not understand other people, not even the basics. This is more hit and miss, some seem to be able to do it occasionally when it suits them. But the ""if I do W, the other person will react with X"" is lost to them, and for even more complicated scenarios like ""if I do Y, that demographic will do Z on some large scale""... that's voodoo. Poor planning. This guy, did he have a detailed plan that lasted even an hour? If he had planned on the shooting taking place at 3pm (I forget the actual time), did he know what he wanted to do at 4:30pm? There's absolutely no concept of any long-term thinking, or for that matter usually not even any short-term thinking.  The inability to judge how large a group of people they belong to and/or how cohesive that group is. They'll see 5 other racists (or whatever their demographic is) and extrapolate that to 20% of the United States and other dumb shit like that. Or, if they accidentally somehow do guess it correctly, they believe their demographic to have more loyalty to each other than it really has ""Wait, you don't want to commit murder with me? But we're both Capricorns!"". This one might not be so cringeworthy (we're far removed from the small tribes we evolved from, and don't have any good mechanisms to determine the truth) except that even though they can't tell, they just invent measurements and believe them true.   You mix these together, and you get a ""if I shoot little old black grandmas, some secret and large group of closet racists will rise up and do abominable things""."

In cases like this the perpetrator builds a view that can be called a 'perfect world' or utopia fallacy. In this view the ONLY thing stopping society from breaking loose into a utopia is their pet 'thing'. Church attendees who believe that more real attendees like them would make the world a perfect place or folks who think that getting some of the money out of politics will usher in an era of thoughtful governance are common types of utopia fallacy. This guy's thinking probably mirrors Timothy McVeigh's after Oklahoma City. A big bang would wake up white people and he'd get away in the aftermath. White Supremacists often seem to look at American society and see the racism, class ism and xenophobia and erroneously believe that subconscious fear of people who are different is the same as believing that segregation and oppression of undesirables are popular ideas, or better yet, would be popular if elites would just let the 'people' see and hear the truth. The biggest reason they are so deluded is that they believe that they have special knowledge which is being actively kept from the populous. If the 'people' only knew the truth about those who are different well then they would welcome their new skinhead overlords."

TrueAskReddit,3b1g4t,cajunace,9,Thu Jun 25 05:00:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, eventually it would become a flag of our own. But the initial action is just impossible to imagine as a black person. The flag was pretty much popularized nationally by white supremacist groups. Some of which directly terrorized black communities, for decades. It has direct ties to the civil war as well. Why would any black person want to take that as their own? To simply eliminate the problem? That's not good enough.   For several generations blacks have had their culture, appearance, and worth belittled and demonized by main stream scoeity. After things like the civil rights movement and more importantly the black power movement, the solution you're suggesting becomes impossible. After those movements black people  were able to take pride in their race on a national scale. Afros became fashionable, black became beautiful within the community.  When blacks were slaves, their culture was beaten out of them. Replaced by the culture of their masters, and then passed on to their children. In the last few decade's blacks have carved their own identity into the mainstream, something they've never really had before. Adopting a flag that symbolizes the trampling and elimination of that identity sets you back about 200 years of progress.   I think the issue is that people forget how recent the flag is to a lot of people. There are people that have older relatives thst were terrorized and killed for trying to make a future for their race and culture. The wounds from racial tension and violence certainly have not healed, race is all to relevant right now for blacks to accept such symbol, the notion is ridiculous."

When you choose to associate and express your ""pride of being from the south"" with the flag of a pro-slavery secession, you do somewhat invite questions along the lines of ""Why is that specific symbol your chosen emblem of regional pride?"" or ""Why aren't you bothered by all the other connotations attached to that symbol?"" or ""Isn't there a better (more precise, less problematically loaded) option you could have picked instead?""  It's not that some stripes and stars and colours can be inherently or objectively racist; they're just geometry.

There is a reason why every military invasion, coup d'etat, or insurrection goes for the TV station first. People are afraid, even when not told to. That means if we live in capitalism (or we think we do) we support capitalism as a way of trying to keep things the same and not make life worse. Capitalism is believe to be the only system that has been actually tested and proven to social cohesion up for large societies. It manages to motivate people to a high degree thus delivering technological innovation and high productivity, even as it decreases quality of life. There is no other ideology right now who can prove to be strictly better by delivering similar advantages + something extra or less of the drawbacks. See here a short speech by a world class communist arguing that we don't really have alternatives at the ready."

It's only the words that have loaded meanings, the practical reality that everyone accepts doesn't reflect that. There is no such thing as a capitalist state.  I think it's better to reframe your question as a technical problem rather than as an attack on capitalism because it just makes people jump onto one side or the other before they even hear what you're saying.

It can also be better, but why risk it? The devil you know, etc. The better off a person is, the stronger this will be.  Furthermore, a lifetime of indoctrination also plays a strong role, I'm sure. For instance, the idea of competition only has two ""approved"" opinions in America especially - either enthusiastic and whole-hearted approval, or qualified approval. If you disapprove of competition altogether, people tend to assume you're a weirdo. This, in spite of the fact that competition is inherently divisive of effort and highly inefficient, as well as prone to causing a great deal of suffering (you get ""winners"" and ""losers"", which really amounts to everyone losing over time.)   Alfie Kohn has lectured on this, here's a great (though audio only) youtube entry titled The Case against Competition that's very thought provoking.  Also, social systems that have come before have only existed in two variations - overtly coercive (the dictatorships like Cuba and the Soviet Union who lay claim to the term communism but are nothing of the sort) or more ""covertly coercive"" (capitalism). Taking a leap from that to an entirely new model that isn't coercive at all but cooperative and based on resource sharing is quite a leap for most people, even though anyone can see that our current approach is not working."
TrueAskReddit,3at3zy,Roike,4,Tue Jun 23 10:14:48 2015 UTC,"As you might guess, this is a question that socialists have been trying to answer for, well, as long as there have been socialists. The question of 'Why haven't the masses revolted?' has been asked countless times throughout history, and a significant branch of Marxism (Critical Theory via the Frankfurt School) has developed that specialises in trying to answer this very question by better understanding capitalist society and how it functions.  At the heart of explanations as to why the working classes do not revolt against the established economic system (i.e. capitalism) is primarily the Marxist conception of ideology. Marx himself said of ideology that 'they [i.e. the people] do not know it, but they are doing it'. By this he meant that ideology is not a consciously performed thing, but constitutive of the basic ways we interpret and view the world. As Louis Althusser (a Frankfurt School theorist) would later state, we are 'always already subjects'.  One of the first theoreticians of ideology (and easily one of the most famous) was Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Marxist. He developed the term Hegemony to describe the ways in which one class dominates another within society. In capitalist society, this represents the domination of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat: the capitalists over the workers. Gramsci's significant development was in extending this domination to the sphere of culture, rather than just the economic and political spheres, as most other theorists had considered. The ruling class, Gramsci wrote, projected its own ethics, morality, and values, not just its economic and political power, onto the world, such that the dominated class came to see through the eyes of the dominator.  Under capitalism, this means that the workers hold bourgeois values, imprinted on them through a variety of means. The mass media, broadcast news, art, music, and culture in general are all (for the most part) produced in accordance with bourgeois values, and work to propagate them, presenting them as 'common sense' or as 'natural'. Recently, Mark Fisher has expanded on the way the existing order (i.e. capitalism) is presented as being just and natural when, particularly with the latter claim, it demonstrably is not. He describes this as Capitalist Realism, whereby late capitalism presents itself as inescapable, thus disinclining the dominated class towards its overthrow, or even towards the consideration of alternatives.  Disinclination towards alternatives to capitalism in the West specifically can be further understood through the notion of Imperialism, whereby rich capitalist nations extract large amounts of surplus value from poorer countries. This hyper-exploitation of third-world workers is paralleled by a relative improvement in conditions for first-world workers, who indirectly benefit from this extraction of value. Some Marxists go as far as to propose that many first-world workers are actually employed at a loss, with the profit instead made in hyper-exploitation abroad. As such, many workers in the West have a vested interest in the maintenance of capitalism because it has, so far at least, benefited them.  I could go on, but that's at least something of a (slightly clunky) answer to your question. Please don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions either: I'm not massively knowledgeable regarding Critical Theory, but I'll give answering them a shot!"

I agree and this is a huge problem. The way I see things, it's a marketing issue, which in turn makes it a money issue, which just makes it so ironic. People need to be made actually aware of all the bad things that capitalism is to be blamed for, but that can take generations if it's a grassroots, counter-culture and educational kind of process. People can't be made aware of it overnight unless Bill Gates pays for the PR campaign that would be necessary for it.

The left have never won, always lost, those that have gone close to victory have been destroyed by mere military might, one way or another they have always been seeked out and destroyed, quite successfully, if I can say so myself. So if you expect losers to make any kind of real progress, then I don't know what to tell you. In this world, victors write history, not losers."

TrueAskReddit,3at3zy,no_malis,2,Tue Jun 23 19:24:09 2015 UTC,I would argue that this is predominantly because of technological development. Capitalism didn't start in the 80's. But huge technological strides were made. Such as the personal computer.

We have technologies that could easily be implemented but have yet to be done because of their detrimental effect on Capitalism and the economy. Such as completely automated solar powered vertical farms. Or magnetic engines that could provide oil independence. The list goes on... And although these things would benefit us tremendously, we have yet to see them because if they were introduced into the economy they would have unforseen and massive negative effects on this type of economy."

Capitalism is focused on improving the lot of the individual, with the idea that it will in the end benefit everyone. It is neat because it's easy to figure out what's best for each person on a case-by-case basis. The problem with large centrally administrated economies is that you rely on the wisdom of a select number of people to decide what's best for everyone - with the obvious problem of human error.  For instance you mention solar farms. While that may seem like a good idea at first it is necessary to take into account all the negative externalities that would come with such a project : pollution from production of the panels, issues with recycling, problems with energy production and so on. What really stops energy producers from building these plants? I would assume many issues a layman isn't aware of exist. Take the example of Germany moving away from nuclear energy - a political decision, the result of which is increased reliance on coal power and importing energy from France (a lot of which is produced by nuclear plants).  The issue of conglomerates not playing fair does exist, but the solution of trusting people to be smart enough to make these decisions for us tends to be the worst one in my opinion. Similarly I prefer democracy over 'enlightened authoritarianism', because I think I know what's best for myself more than any other person."

A centrally controlled economy fits as a nice example of these points. You are the one defining what I described as socialism (which by the way it isn't, socialism does not call for state controlled production, or market manipulation, you may be thinking of marxism-leninism)."

Correlation doesn't prove causation and thanks to your extremely vague definition of capitalism you have no other alternative to contrast it to, making it very hard to justify the notion that capitalism is the cause of technological development for the last 500 years. If you're saying that ""capitalism is the only system to incentive innovation because I haven't seen/can't think of any other"" then you're making an argument from ignorance fallacy.  What you have to do is to provide a direct mechanism for how capitalism promotes technological innovation. What I mean by direct mechanism is not to say something in the vein of ""capitalism creates a society where people are fed and thus have time to innovate"", because there might be many other systems which results in people being fed and hence allowing for technological innovation."

TrueAskReddit,3at3zy,no_malis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"The problem with me is that I see capitalism as part of a continuum of economic thought and philosophies. So while I could agree that as long as you have an agreement about the social contract of private property you could say that you have a capitalistic system, however small. I also view government as an extension of the private property system and hence in my view even government is a corporation. So from my perspective there really isn't much of a difference between a socialistic system and a capitalistic one, there's different kinds of monopolies really. I'm much more interested in the mechanisms and incentive structures in society.  What I propose is neither a capitalistic system or a socialistic system but have certain elements from both, and some are novel or come from other systems such as technocracy.  For the sake of discussion I can run with your definition of capitalism but I just pointing out that I see how it creates problem for defending your position and backs you towards the corner where the best thing you could rationally do is to say ""I don't know"", which isn't too shabby actually. :)"

Why do R&D labs develop new shampoo formulas every year? Because you can make a lot of money doing that. Now, you may personally consider that to be a waste of grey matter. I don't believe I'm qualified to tell people what they should and shouldn't want, and that if new shampoo - I take that example because there's a shampoo bottle right next to me, I'm not a shampoo lobbyist, just thought I'd mention it! :) - will make people happy it's not for me to say they shouldn't buy it."

I'm basically say that there's not hard lines between capitalism and any other economic school of thought. I don't need an alternative to point out the flaws in capitalism or to disagree with you, the points stands and falls on their own merits. None of us has to have a default alternative. But as it is I happen to have an alternative. I think that society could be better of without both a government and ownership and I believe that constructing a society, both socially and physically, is completely a scientific and technical task. Hence I'm advocating for the notion of applying the scientific method for social concern.   Why do R&D labs develop new shampoo formulas every year? Because you can make a lot of money doing that.   Money and profit is often waved around as some sort of universal incentive mechanism, but that isn't entirely true. Daniel Pink has elegantly put forward the problems with this notion in his lecture ""Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us"". The thing is that people aren't as rational or game optimizing as classical economic thought postulates. Human behavior is very complex and it's not as simple as putting in some carrot and a lot of whip and then just expect that the rational behavior will emerge. Reality is many times very counter-intuitive and that's why you have to look at the actual science and not just simple thought experiments.   I don't believe I'm qualified to tell people what they should and shouldn't want   This is a tricky subject. First of all there's a distinction between what people need and what people want. Secondly it's obvious that you can in fact induce and manufacture wants. Now on the other hand, given these two facts, I find it very hard to say for any particular scenario what manipulated want and what's an honest need. But it's still easy to make some clear cut distinctions. If we where to go after IHDI it becomes much more clear cut as to what infact constitutes waste of grey matter and what doesn't. Sure, I would absolutely agree that using a measurement like GDP it's impossible to say if cancer medicine worth $10 million or cigarettes worth $10 million is better for society, but it's obvious that we can device metrics which does in fact tell us how to spend our resources wisely. We can put down some basic parameters that we can easily agree on, such as ecological sustainability, high public health etc. What we then have to do is to look at the science from all different disciplines and do what works."
TrueAskReddit,3at3zy,andoruB,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:23:20 2015 UTC,"the major innovations came out of capitalist markets   No they did not. Scientist, mathematicians, engineers and inventors are just that. They are creative thinkers, they are not merely responding to markets. They may cater to whoever is funding them, but most the time that has been the state, anyway, not capitalists, and that remains true with state subsidies to technological development through research programs in universities and institutes today. The profit is usually privatised of course.    The space race and cold war starved the USSR economy of capital and workforce. It is one of the best examples of how centrally controlled markets fail utterly to improve the living conditions of the population.   What about the cost of imposing a free market globally, which was centrally orchestrated by the traditionally imperialists states remember, costing millions of lives. The initial cost of human life for capitalist industrialisation we saw in Britain was catastrophically brutal and destructive to the workers, feudal society was comparably a paradise. Of course workers formed unions and improved conditions and wages over time, eventually industrialism would create many benefits, but none of this was thanks to capitalism, and easily could have been achieved through a number of other systems, including even fascism, as was seen with the Nazis who were highly innovative and industrious.  Let's assume capitalism was responsible for innovation, which it categorically was not, but for the sake of argument what was the cost of imposing capitalist markets?   You say the 16th century was the beginning of capitalism. Well, take the native population of America, including Canada and the toll was about 80 million. Take Aboriginal Australians, the Tasmania's of which are arguably the only modern human population to be wiped out completely, which regardless of numbers is a significant 'cost to innovation' of opening free markets in Australia, which remember is a centrally controlled state orchestrated affair. Then there was countless wars, Vietnam, Korea, Laos, Cambodia in which millions were killed in order to open up and access markets, imposing capitalism and fighting communism. Then there were countless dictators propped up in places like Indonesia, throughout South America, the Middle East and Africa. There was the entire scramble of Africa too in fact, with the resource blunders and slave trade which enriched the new found capitalist economies, no doubt contributing to 'innovation'.  I'd say the cost was fairly high overall, a bit higher than the USSR's blunder of their economy."

There was resistance to capitalist-imperialism practically everywhere, which suggests countries, like Vietnam; weren't overly enthusiastic about becoming capitalist countries. The two were inseparable from the beginning in that capitalist merchants and imperialists profited from the campaigns and resource grabs. They 'set up shop' around the world for their capitalist businesses and still do. If you don't understand that part of history, I suggest you read more about the campaigns and people like Columbus, Captain Cook and the industrialists of the times.    if I were to play devil's advocate to go along with your train of thought, the communists of the USSR weren't exactly known to be tender.

So the same motivation that makes slaves not abandon their owners? Great example of the virtues of capitalism!   Also, sorry but the goverments funds a lot less research than you seem to think    GDP isn't a good way to understand the division between private and public investment into the development of research and technology because its obfuscated by the fact that a lot of other government spending in some ways supports a population and economy to develop science and research.  For instance did they include low-interest student loans from the government or subsidies to banks which provide these? I doubt it, but that is critical to funding science research. What about the initial grants and public funding for the science in which current science is building upon? I think governments and business should spend more. But that chart doesn't convince me that  there isn't enormous amount of subsidies and funding (also in the form of tax-breaks) which business later profit from, and in essence this is often tax money going straight to corporate profit.   Also, many corporations are wealthier than entire countries which is why they can spend more. Doesn't mean any of that spending on research and science goes to anything useful for the public either, which might not be the case for government grants."

If nobody legally purchases these things, artists will stop making them.*  So if you want good music to exist, you have to also want it to be paid for. But why does that mean you should pay for it? Well, it comes down to the golden rule: treat others the way you want to be treated. If the way you want to be treated is to be exempt from having to pay for music, the golden rule prescribes that you should treat everyone else the same way too: exempt everyone else from having to pay for music. But if you do that, nobody will pay for it, and then music won't exist.*    * Sure, people will still make music, even without getting paid for it. But it costs a lot to get a song professionally produced, and very few people will be willing to do so if they can't at least recoup their costs from album sales or something. So few people, in fact, that recording studios are not going to be sustainable, and they'll go out of business, and along with them, the whole concept of professional-quality music production."

Add to that the cost ($10k+) of equipment, the time (1000s of hrs) spent practicing, and the necessity to hold down other jobs during and you'll start to understand how hard it is to be a musician.

Period.  Just like anyone else that makes something you want.  They are working their asses off to make the best possible product you enjoy and can hopefully get some meaning from, whether its simple entertainment or genuinely transcendental experiences, and everything between.  The music industry especially is screwed up these days, and there are tons of middlemen that obfuscate the costs.  But you should pay what you think content is worth.  If its worth nothing to you, and if most people think its worth nothing, then the quality of content you have become accustomed to will go away and be replaced by trash that is easier to sell and control by middlemen.    I'm not going to keep beating the old arguments of ""these are people who are trying to make a living and have poured blood sweat and tears"" cause if you don't care about the people creating the stuff you consume then you're just a jerk anyway and there's no swaying you.  But think of this:  Do you want to live in a world where you can wander around, pick up trash off the ground and eat food from the garbage can for free, or do you want to live in a society where you can pay a reasonable amount of money for quality goods and nice restaurants where the food is prepared expertly and is more delicious than the sum of its parts?    Part of the reason, IMO, that the music industry is crap, and most music is crap these days, is because its filled with amateur musicians making simple, bland music...why?  Because serious artists can't afford to devote themselves fully to creating, and we are losing brilliant artist and musical minds to other fields just so they can afford to eat.  This is not an exaggeration-its happening everywhere.  Turn on the radio, even compared to 20 years ago the music hasn't changed, its gotten simpler and less creative.  Luckily this phenomenon hasn't happened to TV or film yet, but if no money flows to the creators, they can't afford to create.  Its very simple."

I can tell you, none...or maybe one or two notable exceptions over the past 20 years.  Nothing is grassroots.

In the movie industry, sure some films make a ton of money, like the recent Jurassic Park movie.  But there are a lot of films that lose money and it's often those big movies that float smaller titles that are often a bit riskier or different from typical mainstream works.

TrueAskReddit,3aoq5w,Sammysomeone,2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"The logic in your argument is a classic type of logical fallacy - the idea that your individual actions do not have an impact.  This is the same logic that is behind decisions to purchase 'gas-guzzling' vehicles like SUVs - the environmental impact of one SUV on the whole planet is negligible, so why should you feel bad about buying one?  But if you can see where that argument falls apart on an environmental front, you can see where it doesn't work when applied to the arts as well.  While as an individual your purchasing power is small, you are one of many individuals.  The Apple situation right now is interesting because Apple is a company that leads the market - its customers are loyal, and so the decisions it makes can have a significant impact.  So if Apple decides that artists should be paid more for streams than they are currently being paid by Spotify et al., that's good for artists and good for music in general.  It's analogous to a company like Toyota giving a hard marketing push to electric vehicles instead of SUVs - the behaviour of many consumers will be pushed in a direction that is helpful rather than harmful.  I think it's great that you don't want artists to become 'poor on the streets'.  But I also think you'd be surprised how many artists (and I'm not talking the Taylor Swifts of course, but underground legends like the Misfits, for example) have to work in other jobs to avoid being 'poor on the streets'.  If you like someone's music, then give them financial support, because it will give them more time to make music, and then more is available for you to enjoy."
TrueAskReddit,3aoq5w,Wallstonecraft,2,Mon Jun 22 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"I pay for things that I believe have value. Sometimes I'm not willing to pay the value that has been associated with the thing so I don't pay. Sometimes I want to find out the true valu of a thing so I pay later.  A prime example is the game Amnesia. I pirated it, played it, loved it, completed it then after completing I paid for it on Steam. The creators are an Indie company and need the funds.   Spotify is something I agree with. Top musicians make disgusting amounts of money and I think its bullshit when they take a stand against streaming services in the name of artists. If you really feel that way then invest your fortune into the indie artists you say you're protecting. We can choose to spend more outside of spotify if we think its worth it. Personally, I've got several vinyls, ticket stubbs, pieces of merch etc for that exact reason.  Regarding whether artists should get paid or not I think its a no brainer. If they committ their life to an artform it IS their job. They need to make a living. If you like their art then you should contribute to their living so you can get more art from them later. Sounds stupidly simple but that's what it comes down to really. A service and a cost. BUT... what I don't agree with is the value that record companies associate with so called art. A guy who works in a factory making things which we all use on a day to day basis is not an artist. His creation is not complex. But he does work as hard and, 99% of the time, harder than most artists. This factory worker will make a fraction of top musicians. I think the question should be ""What am I willing to pay for an artists creation?"". A busker is worth a few quid for 5 mins of listening on a street to me. If he's good enough I might buy a CD for the £3 or £4 he is selling them for. That money is fair in relation to the enjoyment I get from it and the need he has to keep producing music. £4 wont go far and to be honest I'd be willing to pay more if the busker was good enough and needed more to keep producing music.  A taylor swift song is worth an advert on youtube and that's where it ends. She has no great need for money now, she can continue making art probably 4 life times over on her current bank balance. I'm willing pay nothing for her music purely because the enjoyment VS her monetary needs doesn't call for it.  So yeah:  Tl;dr  We should be able to pay what we think is right for the 'art' and for the need of the artist.  [Edit]  Spotify paragraph amendment to talk about the 'little man'."

Too many people will take advantage of a system like that, because they don't understand just how much most lesser known artists really need the money.   Obviously yes, Taylor Swift has money, she doesn't need more. But she still worked very hard on her music for it to just go unpaid for. Just the same as any other artists. If you worked hard to create something and that's what you're making a living off of, then you should get paid for it, because that is literally your job. Just because you may be more famous doesn't suddenly mean that all of your hard work should go unpaid for."
TrueAskReddit,3aoq5w,whiptheria,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:00:37 2015 UTC,"But again, define 'hard' work. Like I said, I am paying Taylor Swift when I listen to her music. She's getting ad revenue from me all the time (and indirectly via the BBC I'm sure she is picking up some of my taxes for the amount of radio plays - could be wrong on this one though). That is the worth I associate with her music. She publishes it online to be viewed that way and that is as far as I take it. I don't see her music as any more of a labour than any factory workers creations. I may enjoy her music more than the factory workers labour but is that a justification for the enormous difference in earnings. Don't get me wrong, the enjoyment factor DOES add value and DOES justify some form of difference. It just doesn't add as much value as I think the money would say that it does. The debate isn't really around Swifty though.   The debate is really around how streaming services effect smaller artists. In reality I don't think people go to streaming services for smaller artists. I'm more likely to shell out for an album for a smaller artist than I am for a bigger artist. I go to spotify for the bigger artists. The concept being that by the time an artist is 'big' and on a streaming service they have the revenue they need to sustain themselves (from gigs and tickets sales etc).   Bigger artists are hiding behind the act of 'defenders of the emerging artist' as a way of increasing their revenue. Its like a union except these workers are already wealthy and established and the thing they're unionising against isn't even going to effect the non-wealthy workers negatively because it is a wealthy worker channel. Lol shitty analogy but I'll roll with it.  ALSO, the more buy in to streaming services there is (increased spotify users or whatever) the more these streaming services can afford to give to the artists. Swifty removing her shit from Spotify and getting riled up with apple is only going to damage usage numbers to the service on the whole (yes I do think she is a big enough artist to sway people that much).   Yes, more should be done for poorer emerging artists but I don't think criticising streaming services is the answer. Streaming services are used primarily for the bigger artists. With their fan numbers they can still make a living from it (disregarding ticket sales in RL).    SO I guess the question is:  How to we pay for smaller artists music?  Other than what I said before I don't know tbh."

Eventually you would believe that any other system would be illogical, just as how many capitalists view communism today.

TrueAskReddit,3ajam8,whatamidoing11,2,Thu Jun 25 10:41:41 2015 UTC,"The problem of capitalism is that there will never be post-scarcity. You have a system that necessitates private ownership and the exploitation of labour. In the ideal capitalist society of, let's say complete robotic employment, they will own the means of productions. They will no longer need mass consumers or labour, because they can create post-scarcity for themselves. The difference being that they still engage in greed and self-interest, as they still are engaging in private property.  Whereas, in a communist society any means of production would be delegated to serve the society as a whole. There is a need for the social shift in perception of ownership and to what you perceive as 'self'. If you see your 'self' as an individual or completely tied into society. It is like when you have a family, you stop solely seeing your needs and instead focus on providing for your family unit."

As such, it makes sense to have a feel for what the OP is looking for in a system.  Personally?  I think capitalism - as fucked up as it is - is about as good as it gets.  Why?  Because it's the only one that actually seems to motivate people to get off their collective ass.  Of course, it's got a whole mess of downsides, but the very first requirement for a viable economic system is that there is a viable economy to begin with and that requires that the masses be motivated to actually be productive beyond mere subsistence."

For example, capitalism can take different forms, e.g., more laissez faire vs. more regulatory. Without knowing what particular elements you're focusing on, it would be difficult to recommend a radically different economic system or merely a different shade of capitalism.  But to generally answer your question, I suspect that the Chinese model (or the ""Beijing Consensus"") would be the most viable alternative based on the current state of world affairs. Of course, capitalistic ideas have penetrated that system as well, so I'm not sure if you would consider it a discrete alternative. It's also difficult to determine what you mean by feasible in this context, but China has demonstrated the success of this strategy and possesses the clout to widely promote their ideas."

The word capitalism is now quite commonly used to describe the social system in which we now live. It is also often assumed that it has existed, if not forever, then for most of human history. In fact, capitalism is a relatively new social system. But what exactly does 'capitalism' mean?  Class division  Capitalism is the social system which now exists in all countries of the world. Under this system, the means for producing and distributing goods (the land, factories, technology, transport system etc) are owned by a small minority of people. We refer to this group of people as the capitalist class. The majority of people must sell their ability to work in return for a wage or salary (who we refer to as the working class.) The working class are paid to produce goods and services which are then sold for a profit. The profit is gained by the capitalist class because they can make more money selling what we have produced than we cost to buy on the labour market. In this sense, the working class are exploited by the capitalist class. The capitalists live off the profits they obtain from exploiting the working class whilst reinvesting some of their profits for the further accumulation of wealth."

The alternatives that have been tried (even if very shortly) after capitalism became dominant:   Planned economy (USSR) Market socialism (workers own the means of production, but market still exists - as tried in Iugoslavia) Gift economy (as tried in anarchist territories)   Planned economy didn't work, but it will never be clear if it failed for its own faults or because of the context (started in less developped economies, had to compete with another system which had a head start, USSR spending a quarter of its budget with the weapons race).  Market socialism had even less opportunities to be tried.  But IMHO, market socialism is much more feasible (I'm not arguing it's better) than planned economy because it implies less fundamental changes. The biggest and harder fundamental change is still there, changing the way production and property works. But planned economy necessarily comes with a lot of bureaucracy and all the trouble with comes with making such system workable and democratic.  Gift economy is the less feasible alternative possible. It implies changing absolutely everything. The difficulty of implementing this is absurd.

That is to say ideally you give people always enough money to live comfortably lives with enough money for the conveniences that life has to offer even without working...but if they want to earn more they have to work for it. If they want luxuries they need a job to pay for it. If they don't have a job, fine, live in normalcy and let others go for greatness. Or let others be more charitable in their lives doing things for or less money for their neighbor. Like on a basic income idea a person could work at a homeless shelter or  teacher or help others privately without worry about becoming bankrupt.   The increasing automation of society means eventually humans will have to work far less then they originally did. Eventually there won't be any work for many humans, but plenty of goods around.  At its core, you are never going to replace captialism unless that change is natural. Almost all socialism changes require some sort of violent change and they end up being more autocracies ""while change is taking place"" but like in soviet union but it never happens. You can have a more planned economy like china but Chinese citizens are really happy buying into the capitalism so they can raise themselves into the middle classes.   The future of economy and capitalism won't be a brutal solution that needs to overthrow the government. Unless people are starving, not entertained, without homes and sex, people will not revolt or care enough to issue change.

So, assuming there are some property rights in the Federation (Picard seems to own a vineyard in one alternate future, and Sisko's dad owned a restaurant), that means there can be disputes about property.  That means somebody could want Picard's vineyard who doesn't have it.  Maybe in some cases the person would simply give the land over; but humans being humans that won't always be the case.    Perhaps the Federation simply owns all the property and lets citizens use it based on their own merit system.  This would not require money, but I don't think it's a great idea.  Alternatively the person who wants Picard's property could offer other property in exchange.  But what if they don't have the exact property Picard wants, what then?  They could try to find another property that Picard wants, and try to exchange their property for that... but that is getting tricky.  What if it's four steps away?  In that case it might be great to use a system of credits and a pool of available resources so that you can just give Picard credits for his property and Picard can worry about getting what he wants in exchange.

This is in contrast with the definition under capitalism, where the company exists only for the benefit of the shareholders. France tends more towards a close interaction between the state and major companies, while managing to avoid corporatism quite successfully. The UK has no overarching political/economic philosophy - so it is entirely normal for a fund manager (i.e. a capitalist) to be a member of the regional cooperative society and also be in favour of state control of the health service - three very different political positions, held by one person.

TrueAskReddit,3ajam8,Potss,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:16:20 2015 UTC,"Here's my point of view. The question is loaded with the incorrect assumption that economics is something that gets driven by a system, that it's the economics itself that's driven directly by societal decision.  In fact, economics is an after-thought following whatever power distribution happens to be in effect. It's political power that is the first cause.  In other words, I'd rephrase your question as ""what's more likely to follow the current plutocratic world order?"" I'd say some form of autocracy/tyrnany is most likely based on the fact that formal democracy and high inequality often leads to mobs and mobs really like violent retributive dictators to ""punish"" the ""vieux regime""."

But even in the more generalized sense Capitalism has helped shaped the world to be a more ""equal"" place; we are not trading women for social-bond in order to circumvent inherent hostility that follows along with trade/exchange anymore--atleast not as blatantly.   I think the alternative to Capitalism is simply a defined system in how Capitalism functions; usury should be regulated/done away with, there should be a form of ""Base-income,"" there should be income caps, taxes should make more sense, etc.   With that being said, we all (Americans) have this ""work=pay"" mentality, which I believe is the bigger problem; how we interface with the abstraction of money/labor needs to change as it is impeding any progress for an even more ""equal"" system. Maybe we could call this ""paid consumerism?"" But most people I know, given money, would invest in the world around them. Some would buy stupid shit, sure, but for the most part we are all tied to someone else, whom we have a desire to provide for; more buying-power in everyone pocket, I believe, leads to a less selfish society.

The gap between the rich and poor, the elite and the lower-classes is huge.  1% own 99% of the wealth.....the powerful stay in control because of money.  Governments make decisions that help the highest bidder rather than the needs of the many.  Is this really equal??  When the brightest of us, who go to the best schools and have the biggest loans taken from banks, are leaving school to go and work for those banks to pay it off on Wall Street, for an industry that does nothing for society, in fact, it's detrimental to it, that appeals to them because of the vast amounts of money to be made, well, is working just for the good of man-kind ever going to interest anybody?"

There is no one blanket solution, the change has to occur at a cultural level and that means it cannot be localized to just economics. We have to change how we function, how we treat each other, and what our goals are as a society. This will take a lot of time and effort just to get the change started.  In the meantime, I think the best economic system for the developed world is a hybrid capitalist and socialist system. The idea of capitalism, as it was originally conceived was a good one. What we have today is a basterdized, deformed version of what capitalism should be. Modern technology and social manipulation has allowed the manufacturers and service providers to circumvent the traditional customer/provider relationship. In a capitalist economy, the consunmer really should be king. This is where the socialist aspect would come in. We need objective oversight to prevent manipulation of the economy and return the power to the consumer. This could mean, but is not limited to restricting marketing, dismantling monopolies, enforcing fair price, and enforcing product standards.   The achilles heel of this idea is that the people who control the manufacturing and services industry can use their wealth to manipulate those incharge of oversight (which is what is happening today). I'm not an economist so maybe what I saying makes no sense, but it doesn't take a financial degree to know what we have now isn't working and the first step to fixing it is to remove the people who are unfairly benefiting from position of making decisions."

There's been a bit of gradual progress, but part of why Elizabeth Kubler Ross's work was so significant is that she actually dared to talk openly about the reality of death. Like sex and sexuality, death is something we sweep under the rug. We speak of it using euphemisms like ""passed away."" In recent history, its very existence has often been hidden from children, much like the existence of sex. Kubler-Ross speaks, very interestingly, of parents up through the 50s and 60s telling children that their dead parent had ""gone away on a trip for a while"" and things to that effect.   For further reading on the subject, I highly recommend Elizabeth Kubler Ross's On Death and Dying and Ernest Becker's The Denial of Death.  I am not saying that we shouldn't pursue techologies that could significantly increase our lifespans. I mean, think of the extra knowledge and wisdom you could gain by living for two hundred years instead of eighty, provided you also avoided age-related neurodegeneration. I think there could certainly be value in finding a way to live for more than one century.  However, I think it's troubling that so many people-- even many intelligent, insightful, and self-aware people-- have not yet really accepted, on a deep, personal, and psychological level, without fear and without anger, hate, or sadness, that one day, you and everyone you know will no longer exist. It's a natural thing that occurs, even beyond the concept of organisms dying. Stars are born, and eventually die. Planets form, and are eventually destroyed. The universe arose, and will one day ""die,"" probably in a slow heat death over trillions of years.  Change is constant, whether it's changes in biological processes over time in a human body, or changes in matter and spacetime itself across the life of the universe as a whole. Things come into being, and eventually, are dissolved. Without these processes of change, which involve both ""birth"" and ""death"" in their many forms, reality as we know it could not exist. We could not exist. Although matter and energy are conserved, structures or ""entities"" like particles, planets, and lifeforms come into being and are likewise dissolved."

We've yet to even figure out how exactly our brains think (or even what exactly constitutes ""you"" as a intellect or soul). So it may take a lot longer than we imagine to get the sci-fi superpower type stuff. But those things are on the way.

TrueAskReddit,3a92aa,autopornbot,9,Mon Jun 22 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this is going to be the century when climate change and other consequences of pollution come to a head and humanity has to either band together to deal with it or face unprecedented tragedy. This means abandoning fossil fuels, radically changing our entire planetary energy infrastructure, hopefully decentralization of energy production, unprecedented government regulation of pollution internationally, and probably even steps taken to gather up pollutants and greenhouse gasses to begin reversing environmental changes and degradation. As far as technology is concerned, one of our big goals right now is revolutionary change in battery technology. We need them to be far lighter, far smaller, store far more energy, and to be as close to 100% recyclable as possible. Another major goal is utilizing renewable sources of energy production, like wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and things we don't know about yet like fusion. If we can figure out what to do with nuclear material and make reactors safer (I had family near Fukushima), newer, more efficient and safer nuclear plants would be worth considering as well.   Food production and distribution is also in dire need of overhaul. The factory system we have now seems geared towards low costs regardless of the consequences, which is perfectly reasonable within a capitalist system but which is providing us with very low-quality food, is driving monoculture (which makes us susceptible to catastrophic loss of food due to things like pests and disease), the impoverishment of farmers, and the mistreatment of animals, not to mention the waste of water and the creation of pollution. We're already working on lab-grown meats, and I suspect that kind of food science will make great strides this century. If we can combine that kind of science with where 3D printing is headed next, I actually think it may be possible to have a device similar Star Trek replicators for the production of food. Food produced on farms, be it plant or animal, would become a luxury item which would be priced more appropriately given the skilled labor. If we can't manage the use of energy fields to rearrange molecules to create food, we at the very least need to take a more global look at food, because the current system is failing a lot of people. An unimaginable amount of food is wasted while people go hungry. I'd like to see the application of processes to change environments to make them more suitable to the production of food. We can reverse deserts. We can redirect water. The technology exists in some version now, but imagine a toolbox we can use. We go into an impoverished area, and we set about turning it into fertile land with water and which is ready to produce more than enough food for the community.   I suspect driving will be a speciality skill by then, given how quickly Google's self-driving car is making its way from the drawing board to the roads. That's going to change transportation and shipping forever. Jobs will be lost, both private and public, but ultimately significant progress will be made in lessening traffic, pollution, costs of shipping, and lives. I've driven around the Google self-driving Lexus a good two dozen times, and it's one of the most calm drivers I've ever seen. There still may be the occasional accident or traffic jam, but they're going to be quite rare and probably far less severe.   Speaking of, this is almost certainly the century for artificial intelligence, which may be humanity's greatest achievement.

There are too many situations I can think of where I might need to go above the speed limit in an emergency, make an illegal u-turn or something of the like. I'm all for the self driving for basic travel. But in the event that I need to make a decision absent from the most immediate traffic laws then I feel there should be a manual override option."
TrueAskReddit,3a9n1g,Sage_CFC,6,Thu Jun 18 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"There are very few contexts where needing to go over the limit ""in an emergency"" is a real thing.

And I'm not sure about uturns either; most of the uturns I make are a result of being slightly lost and missing a turn or something, which is a problem a self-driving car wouldn't be vulnerable to.

Move from behind a large vehicle, often carrying large loads that are sometimes improperly secured? Will the car be able to make all those decisions?   What about a detour, or a traffic officer directing you to a different route? Parking in unspecified lots? How will the car handle debris on the road, the kind that come from off the road specifically? Will the car always stop if a pedestrian steps in front of the car? That would be a major issue for people in high crime areas, there are some neighborhoods where you do not stop for anything, not even traffic lights.   How will the car react in adverse weather conditions? Heavy snow that covers the road lines, power outages, flooded roads and pathways that require off road travel.   There are also people that require a specialized vehicle for their livelihoods, combined with their manual control of said specialized vehicle.   I just think there are too many situations people are faced with on the roads that are completely separate from other vehicles and traffic laws. Simply asking for a manual override option for the self driving car isn't an unfair request."
TrueAskReddit,3a9n1g,Sage_CFC,3,Thu Jun 18 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"The car would take care of all of that. It would know exactly how to react in every scenario.

They would know about all detours, they would be able to handle debris and bad weather much faster than you could.   A manual override option would defeat the purpose of all of that. What if there is a whole highway full of cars moving at the exact speed they need to to go the fastest possible route and there's one guy who decides to use the manual override option? Now there's real danger, because the other cars have no clue what he's going to do. Now they're all subject to any human errors the guy can make. It defeats the purpose."

The relevant number here is the number of accidents caused by human error that would have been avoided by a computer driver. Yes, a computer is better than any human, but I suspect that the people who enjoy driving are better than average drivers.   I also think its a moot point because people are slow to adapt to any new technology.

If everybody on the interstate was at the same speed, that would never happen. With self driving cars, each lane could be a different speed. The left lane could be 90 MPH while the right lane could be 60 or 70.  What if cars had a safety feature or a sensor that made it impossible to wreck or even another car to crash into your car? The ones without the sensor would be the one crashing into a telephone pole.  It has taken people forever to use seatbelts. Even with heavy fines, some people refuse seatbelts. Self driving cars will be the same. As the OP stated, Big brother will slowly pass laws to force change. Auto manufactures will be mandated to make the changes whether we like it or not.

Maybe I'm being short sighted....time will tell.  The problem I have is that once people start buying these cars, they will have to maintain them, services etc.  And there are always going to be people that think they can service them themselves rather than paying professionals to do it.  One day, you'll be in your car, being driven down the road, when coming towards you is another driverless car, except this one has been serviced by its owner.

TrueAskReddit,3a9n1g,mhfpcs,3,Thu Jun 18 21:14:12 2015 UTC,I am so confused by your comment. Not like semantically. But the emotion behind it? I just don't get It. Why do you care? And where do you draw the line? What if someone else is driving? What about being on an airplane? What if we have automated trains? Is power steering and traction control taking away your responsibility? Seat belt laws? Should we eliminate the requirement for a driver's license?   I know some of those are probably ridiculous and seem like they have nothing to do with your point. But that's how I feel reading your comment.
TrueAskReddit,3a9n1g,gzilla57,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"No it's fine, they're not ridiculous. You raise some good points.  I just sort of reacted emotionally to this question.  It's my opinion that when people describe a perfect world where self-driving cars are the norm and everything is way more efficient and safe, they are describing a world where every single car on the road is self-driving. 100%. IMO the concept wouldn't work unless every car is self-driving. But then, it's more like public transportation rather than car ownership. Why would anyone even own a car? Wouldn't it make more sense to have one model of car only, and to have them just drive around until someone needs them? Like an all-powerful, all-consuming uber?   It fundamentally doesn't make sense to make a variety of cars, and to have individuals own them, if all 100% of them are self-driving. It would only make sense to make more than a few designs if the self-driving feature was an option, a luxurious feature. Imagine, for example, that you strap into your future Porsche and when you're commuting it drives itself and you to work, but then you take the long way home and work on your trail-braking and your heel-toe technique. I can see that, I even welcome that.  But that makes the fantastic scenarios people describe impossible.  As soon as one person decides to turn off auto pilot and control his own car you could never have the perfect highway where every car is exactly 1 foot off the bumper of the next car, each progressing at a perfect 75 mph on the way their respective destinations. You would have to remove every car ever manufactured off the road and make it illegal to drive your own vehicle. Driver's licences would be eliminated.  This is where I passionately react to the situation. I am a die-hard car enthusiast. I love every car. I love oldparkedcars.com for heaven's sake. I think they are the highest form of industrial art. I know this takes subjectivity to a new level, but I am not alone. I personally find the idea of the government coming to my home and taking my car away to make this magical transportation grid possible repulsive. I do believe in personal responsibility. If you don't want to wear a seat-belt, that is more than ok with me.   You raise a very good point when mentioning the issue of passengers, either in cars, or planes, or trains, or what have you. I'm not really sure how to respond to that honestly. In some way I view cars as being more related to personal interest and expression than I do things like trains and airplanes which are very important features of our public transportation system. At the same time I'm sure their are guys who are into airplanes that would identify with lots of the points I'm making.  To continue, I have no issues with better car safety. I love the idea of blind-spot monitoring, regardless of the fact that if your mirrors are set up properly the blind-spot doesn't exist. I think the prospect of cars taking me to work, or braking for me if I'm distracted, or monitoring my face to make sure I'm awake is awesome and truly a step forward. I just think that deciding one day that everyones' cars are going to the scrapper to make way for the future is a violation of my rights as a free man. I believe that the human experience involves decisions that could result in death. I don't think it's in our best interest to remove these things. I don't think designing a heroin that couldn't kill you is a good idea because, sometimes, people die of an overdose. I think people have a responsibility to make their own choices, to be an individual. Functionally everyone on earth could wear the same outfit everyday, but that would take away from what it means to live your life the way you want to.  I think that the reaction to trying to make this 100% self-driving car thing happen would bring about a public response that would make the gun control debate look apathetic in comparison. I think that all of the people who have never experienced how amazing driving the right car in the right way, are people missing out on something that is a fundamental part of classic american history and culture. I makes me sad that our economy is so bad people have decided that owning a car just isn't worth it.  I'll leave you with a video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKp7BrfOpEU"

TrueAskReddit,3a87fa,poiaze,0,Thu Jun 18 04:18:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is mathematically fundamentally different. Your taxes are not a secret to the government. Cheking your bank balance online is fairly secure because it needs to be secret to outsiders but your bank need to authenticate you and your bank activity is no secret to the bank.  How you vote should be secret. So you must reconcile the need to authenticate people so that they cast one and only one ballot. And at the same time how you vote should remain anonymous.   This problem is NOT solved for e-voting. Every voting system in place has some sort of e-envelope/token system, but you HAVE to trust the government and the contractor that the system behaves as advertised and doesn't register who votes for whom. Your vote can easily be traced back to you. You have to bindly trust the e-voting system that your vote remain anonymous and that the results will not be altered.  With paper the electoral process is simple, transparent, anonymous while being controlled and checked by the citizens.

You have to trust the elected government/bureaucrats/contractors not to fuck up and mingle with the results and you have to blindly trust them. A unique code doesn't prevent that.

TrueAskReddit,3a87fa,poiaze,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"What pairing? I assume you are refering to postal voting (voting by mail) which doesn't exist everywhere. I personnaly don't like postal vote either. What we have is mostly polling stations with no pairing whatsoever with a good paper process. Some problems induced by postal voting are shared with e-voting. Potential coercion, easier vote selling... Sure postal workers could open letters, but it's messy, it leaves traces, and it's mostly a lot of work, proportional to the number of ballots. You would need a lot of manpower. Whereas with e-voting, just one person can alter million of votes. For mail-in ballots you have a system of double enveloppes, and with assessors and observers it can be relatively well checked and controlled. It's less safe than polling stations though. But again, fraud is still a lot of work. It can be checked by citizens. Whereas e-voting relies on blind trust and one person (or a very small group of people) can alter millions of votes.  By voting we delegate power, so it's the one time citizens have direct power, so it better be controlled by citizens and not by the rulers. Elections are not that often, and we can't afford to lose that control. It's a balance. Now maybe in switzerland you have lots of popular votations and direct democracy, so maybe you are willing to take that risk. Another case is expats where some sort of mailed ballot can be advantageous considering the remoteness to the closest polling station. I'm a technology enthusiast and e-voting is a big no-no for general elections for me. Mayeb we'll get there some day, but we're not there yet.    Sorry for the walls of text.

You see that your bank balance is altered and it's not secret to your bank. There are records and the justice can be involved to review them if need be. It's not secret. You don't want the general population to know you bank balance (privacy) but your bank knows it. When you vote you have to cast your vote (express a preference) while being assured that your ballot is accounted for and at the same time identify yourself (one and only one ballot per citizen) whil simultaneously remaining anonymous regarding your preference (secret ballot).

What that means in practice, is that the poorest demographics will have to wait the longest to vote. So the poorest people in the country have to take the most un-paid time off work (assuming their employer will allow it). Where i grew up, on my way to work I walked in, signed a book, and walked over to an empty machine. I took no time off work; that hardly seems fair.   I'm also not that thrilled about ""normal citizens"" overlooking the process. Many people have their own biases and weird justifications for the shit they pull.

Before entering the Eurozone, Spain has a highly protectionist system with barriers to trade preventing free market competition from displacing local businesses.  After entering the Eurozone, many businesses were struggling to compete against German economic dominance or Eastern European labor costs, but they were slowly adapting.  They might have pulled through (Spain's leadership certainly thought it was a good possibility, that's why they agreed to join the Eurozone) - but then the economic crisis of 2008 happened, and all of these struggling businesses went bankrupt simultaneously.  Unemployment shot up to double-digit percentages, and stayed there for years.  Spain has a much better chance of recovery however, since the root of the problem was inefficiency, rather than corruption.  Spain doesn't have a lot of the problems that Greece does, such as:   Government bloated with do-nothing crony positions Far-too-generous pension plans for retirees guaranteed by the government Culture that condones and encourages tax evasion.   In addition, Spain has a healthy (locals probably don't consider it healthy, but it is) internal divide between the economically powerful Catalonia region, and the politically powerful everywhere else.  This puts pressure on the national government to enact real beneficial change, since pulling the shit Greece is trying will just provoke Catalonia into separating like they've been talking about for the past few decades.    If that happened, the Catalans would be fine (aside from maybe a civil war, which would suck for everyone) - but the rest of Spain would collapse economically."

Proxies, VPNs, or TOR (the onion router). TOR, when used and configured properly, is the closest you can get to true internet anonymity. All traffic is encrypted and passed through three ""intermediary"" computers, then to a TOR exit node. There is no way to easily tell where the traffic came from, unless there are some mistakes made in the services you use or how you configure them. Presumably, that's something most hackers take very seriously.   Hackers can also spoof the data that simple tools would use to determine the source of an intrusion, or set up delayed-action tools on a remote ""zombie"" computer so they are completely uninvolved when the action takes place. If they are going to do something very risky, doing it with the above methods while using a public wifi or stealing access to someone else's wifi network can add one more layer of obfuscation.  This is just the stuff that I can think of off the top of my head. Someone more seasoned will definitely be able to go into more detail, or provide some corrections.

Besides, if the person is intruding they are either using a stolen username and password (which tends to be easy enough to get with people using their names and some easy to guess passwords) or exploiting a security deficiency to get past that. The MAC address is just for the most superficial layer, which is what the vast majority of admins would check first, if they check at all, when a user account is doing some odd things.

TrueAskReddit,39t7bj,atluxity,14,Sun Jun 14 19:28:01 2015 UTC,"The organizations you mentioned are all American, while a huge portion of the Internet is not. The FBI has to rely on local support to seize or investigate systems located in other countries, and smart hackers know which countries are likely to help -- and which are not. The CIA doesn't really spend any time worrying about all but a very small subset of hackers, and the NSA, while great at collecting and analyzing large amounts of information, don't really have much of an investigative arm -- and even if they did, Federal law prohibits them from doing very much with domestic Internet traffic. Even if they did see that a hacker was operating, they rarely tell the FBI or other law enforcement about that sort of thing. They're focused on national security, and a lot of their methods wouldn't be accepted in a court of law anyway.  In short, you can't keep your identity secret from everybody, but you can compartmentalize it across different jurisdictions unlikely to work together. You can also change it up every so often to thwart any long-term cross-jurisdictional investigations, as it can take months or years to get the cooperation with a half-dozen nations' law enforcement organizations and acquire all the subpoenas and search warrants necessary to track just one hacker.    Smart hackers also avoid keeping incriminating information or evidence of their activity on their local systems. That way, even if they are raided, they can argue that the real hacker is someone else. No hacker is un-catchable, but with enough effort, most can make it hard enough to catch them as to make it more worthwhile to spend those law enforcement resources on bigger fish."
TrueAskReddit,39t7bj,DrKronin,9,Sun Jun 14 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"When a server gets a connection from somewhere, it gets to know the IP of the other party. This IP however, do not have to be easily connected to any one person.  It might be the IP of a library, the IP of an obviously hacked server or the IP of a service designed with the goal of hiding the IP of the real connection. These can also be stringed together to provide several layers of cloaking.  Each one of these steps take a certain amount of effort, meaning time and man-hours, to attempt to uncloak. Sometimes hours, sometimes days. If this is done in a skilled way there is no way of tracing a certain connection. I would argue that the ones being caught is the ones doing it wrong. (As with many crimes)  One of the main issues I believe the American authorities are facing is that these cloaks can go via many jurisdictions that are not America-friendly, like Russia and China.  The other issue that I believe can have some validity is that even if one believe NSA knows all and has access to all, it might be true, but they can not afford to expose that they have this knowledge. They want to keep their methods hidden, and then they cant use it to go after every other petty criminal. And they might only use it to give the 'regular' investigation a good hint, and then the regular investigation have to find another way to provide proof to the judge. I believe this is what happened to the Silk Road guy."

What's really preventing us from cloning humans is the lack of maternal eggs.  Even with hormone therapy, we can only harvest tens of eggs every cycle from a single person, which requires a lot of effort and (i think) a surgery for their removal.  If 1/600 make it past the first week in vitro, and its costs hundreds of thousands for a single chance, not many people are jumping on that hype train.   I dont think cloning is necessarily wrong, but its MUCH more complicated for humans than even other mammals, because of our longevity and our ability to differ our state of mind from another.

Parents who know their child has a much higher likelihood of being disadvantaged are still allowed or even encouraged to have children.  While extreme and perhaps a little different, I don't see how this is necessarily an evil for the prospective child or an unethical arrangement for the potential parents.

I don't really buy this reasoning. As long as you're not knowingly giving them worse food than they'd otherwise get, you'd not be doing anything more unethical than what already happens in prison.  I mean, consider the current system: Some nutritionist puts together a menu based on his or her best guesses (qualified guesses, but still). What you'd be doing in your experiment, would basically be to do the same job, but with better record-keeping.

However, what I'd argue is that if the guy takes that offer, he obviously thinks that the gain outweighs the cost. In other words, without giving him that offer, he'd be worse off.

Say, for example, you wanted to compare vegetarian diets to omnivorous diets. Easy.   Ethical? That'd be gray. Military culture operates in such a command-driven manner that even a request could be misunderstood as a ""request"" (meaning this is an order but if asked don't say it was an order). And, not to offend anyone who's served, but the military uses pretty well-understood brainwashing techniques.

Our a priori assumption is that a vegetarian diet is better for you, so you'd be increasing the expected future health outcomes of the treatment group without changing the expected future health outcomes for the control group, and neither group would be able to control their food intake in the absence of an experiment so removing their agency isn't an issue either.

(""Genie,"" linked by another poster, is probably the most well-known.)  However, it is very difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relative roles of nature and nurture in these cases because we typically have very little information about the child's functioning prior to becoming isolated, and there are a number of other factors that can confound an analysis of the situation.  For example, it may be that the child was lower-functioning to begin with (and may in fact have had some profoundly limited capabilities).  As a matter of fact, this may have contributed significantly to the parents' decision to isolate or abandon the child.  Such children are also often poorly cared for, physically.  Thus, other factors, such as malnutrition, may have also limited the child's cognitive development.  Cases of extreme neglect and isolation such as these are extremely horrifying, to be sure, and a more nurturing environment would almost certainly have improved one of these children's prospects by a large margin.  But to what extent, I don't think that we can truly say."

TrueAskReddit,38l76o,klondikegrenade,31,Thu Jun 4 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"It has certainly affected the way in which I interpret social media. I am incredibly skeptical about any supposed news, facts, or studies that are being passed around with a single click. I do my best to internally filter out this aspect of social media in favor of personal anecdotes, photos, and other status updates that I'm interested in.    Afterall, this was social media's original intent. It being used as a news and agenda vehicle is a newer concept, and it is wrought with problems. A system based on glances and single-click responses per media item will never avoid such shortcomings when the subject matter is much more complex. Also, the reviewers are far from subject matter experts.   This situation we find ourselves in may reflect our culture's degradation of the importance of journalism. Twitter gets the news out faster than ever before, but it does nothing to validate."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,Madpony,11,Thu Jun 4 23:42:13 2015 UTC,"Morally acceptable? Yeah I mean when you pass on the information you probably assume it's right. So there's no moral wrong doing there on your part.  But, I do believe there is an obligation to do some deeper digging because the media is a means of control. This means leaving details out, fabricating or embellishing, even diverting your attention. As a responsible consumer of information, you should always be aware of the source but even then that doesn't mean you'll get the whole truth.  This is the biggest reason why government transparency is so incredibly important but it's also why it doesn't happen."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,lamegimp,0,Thu Jun 4 23:49:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it an obligation though. More like an imperative.
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,Louiecat,9,Fri Jun 5 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"I always check the reddit discussion about whatever topic before I forward it - sometimes there's people who have already done the due diligence and quickly explained why said article is overoptimistic, full of shit, or not getting enough support for how great it is.  Of course, I check whatever sources they cite or perform a sanity check on their argument, too.  When we start forwarding stuff we find online, we become publishers ourselves - so we should do some checking if it is going to be more than our opinion."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,chilehead,2,Fri Jun 5 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"I think that it's important to be critical of each bit of ""news"" that comes out.  I try to remember that this is the internet, and people can be of a mob mentality.  I've fallen for articles myself.  So I check that it's a current date, that it's a valid source (check the url of the article), and see who is posting it and what (if anything) they are saying or highlighting about the article.    Then if there are comments, I will often read them to see what different perspectives are being gathered about the article and the issue.  Then I will read the article (if by now I've found it's likely valid), and pass it on if I so desire.  If I find that it is not a valid article, or it seems to be a circlejerk article between a few linked websites, or something of that nature, and someone I know has posted it (facebook or wherever), I usually point it out.  My sister used to post a lot of things that fact checking with snopes or google would have shown to be false.  I would just post a link to something showing it was not legitimate information.  I've seen her fact check other people in the last few years so she definitely took the lesson to heart."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,wildweeds,4,Fri Jun 5 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"As a consumer, no. We are under no obligation to fact check. As a spreader, yes. Once you move from the consumer of information to the spreader of information the due diligence to check your facts is morally imperative that you do. Just as a consumer of any other product you are not supposed to be aware of its dangers unless told beyond the reasonable person standard, you are obligated to tell those who will consume the information after of the dangers which they face with this information.   That being said. Should you as an intelligent person not hold yourself to a higher standard than mere consumer. What is the information worth if it is not to be shared?"
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,Final7C,4,Fri Jun 5 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"Of course, people ought to check the veracity of information they forward, but you can't force them to.  About the only thing you can do is try to correct the information they post, but they rarely take it well.  My parents' friends send them some really racist emails about Obama containing false information.  I got my mom to email them back with a link proving it was incorrect, and they stopped getting emails from them altogether.  Then last Christmas my parents didn't get a card from them, although they always had before.  I don't think that human stupidity is a problem we're going to be able to fix any time soon.  About all we can do is value truth as a virtue, and encourage other people around us to do so too."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,virnovus,5,Fri Jun 5 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"People are responsible for their speech.  Just as if a driver, while being wreckless, killed someone unintentionally they are still responsible for the death, so is someone still guilty of passing on a lie to others through their own irresponsibility and mental laziness.  It's not a moral issue, it's a character issue."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,foodown,4,Fri Jun 5 01:34:41 2015 UTC,"People should fact check, but never will. A better solution would be for Facebook to implement a filter into their Newsfeed algorithm that allows moderators to highly de prioritize known false content so that it slows the viral spread. Another route would be to use data from content that is reported by users. If a certain threshold of reports per average number of views occurs, that content is highly de prioritized or removed all together in an automated fashion.   The second thing might already be in place - I'm not sure. However, I still commonly see untrue bs content, so if it is in place, it isn't integrated as tightly as it could be."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,nond,0,Fri Jun 5 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"But a lot of information is very qualitative, the facts can still be spun. For example, Right-wing news, even when based on facts, is highly sensationalized, highly spun.   Like, there is no real ""truth"" behind things like Ferguson--all reports on that subject were only part of the picture. The media pushed the rioting and looting to the forefront, but obviously other things were going on as well that had more political/social significance.   More importantly, the media often breaks things into a dichotomy presupposing the viewership's leanings as either ""for"" or ""against."" Most world events do not, in actuality, happen in a dichotomy.   I think the ultimate solution is to always remain skeptical, always ask another question. Be wary of how information has already been prepared for consumption; is it leftist, right, marxist, etc."

The fact that we obtained such information from some other source does not mean that others are not justified in thinking such things about us."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,PikachuSnowman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:15:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's unreasonable to expect everyone to fact check their own news. Sometimes it takes a very precise skill set to know why something is inaccurate.  I started an open newsroom for fact checking social media (https://grasswire.com, also see @grasswirefacts). There's no way I could do it on my own, even if I spent all day."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,tianan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"The stronger my urge to share something, i.e. the stronger my outrage, the stronger my urge is to at least do a cursory fact check.  Typically just a google search or two, to corroborate at least something.  I despise the viral spread of bad information.  Ever since the mid-1990s with all the ridiculous e-mail chains that people used to forward.  I got sick of those and turned it into something of a personal crusade which I still carry forth to this day.  I think people should show a little bit of skepticism when forwarding or sharing information, but I realize that's a lot to ask.  Some innate part of the human condition seems to compell us to spread information without checking it.  I want to say it was Mark Twain that said this, but I could be wrong:  ""A lie can get halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes""  (source appears to be correct)"
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,Philo_T_Farnsworth,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"Morally, I'd say yes we do have a responsibility to those we care about, and also a responsibility to ourselves, to take reasonable care that the information we share is accurate. A ""duty of skepticism,"" if you will.  Legally, the standard is to not spread false information knowingly, and not spread false information we believe will injure someone recklessnessly."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,TouchedByAnAngeI,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the disinformation that spreads in the wake of a controversial or politically salient issues actually comes from the general public more often than  news outlets.   Outrage tends to have a memetic quality on the internet. Generally, I would say the process seems to work like this:   A politically controversial figure makes a statement about an important subject. A news outlet picks up the story and relays the information in a manner which heightens the controversy. Demagogs for a particular ideology pick up the news story and simplify the controversy in order to support or oppose the politically controversial figure as their ideology dictates. Consumers of the demagoguery further simplify the controversy when they exchange the story as a means of confirming their ideological beliefs.    You can see this process play out in social media all the time. The Nestle water rights thing is a good example. The CEO of the company said something about water rights which was controversial but by no means extreme. By the time the story was making the rounds on the social media websites, the statement went from being about how water should be treated like foodstuffs for the general population to ""The CEO of Nestle wants to restrict poor people's access to drinking water"" A position which was never seriously held.   If you aren't fact checking stories, especially when the presented interpretations of those stories strongly agree with your own personal beliefs, I think that you run a serious risk of being caught up in the process I outlined above. So if you care about disseminating truth, you should do fact checking. If you are trying to amplify your ideology across your social network, then fact checking will probably just slow you down."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,Jolly_Girafffe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"To a certain extent, yes, it is fine.  Everybody undergoes the same process when receiving new information, whether it be a sound, peripheral glimpse of something, or something we perceive as relevant information. We automatically assess the situation to determine if accepting this new information and acting upon is detrimental or helpful. If there is minimal risk in accepting this information without confirmation, then we do it, and usually without a second thought. If there is substantial risk, then usually our instincts kick in and prod us to probe farther.  TL;DR: We are programmed to pass on low risk information without fact checking, and it's been relatively harmless so far."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,icopywhatiwant,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. If you are helping in the spread of information you think is faulty, you are intentionally attempting misinformation. If you are helping in the spread of information that, to the best of your knowledge, is truthful, you cannot be faulted. If you are unsure of the voracity of the information you encounter, do not spread it until you have verified its truthfulness for yourself."
TrueAskReddit,38l76o,kilkil,-1,Thu Jun 18 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"In theory one of the key tenets of Journalism is to fact check and simply report accurate information. Unfortunately this has been thrown away for the almighty profits (with a few exceptions I would assume) and now we get ""infotainment"". I don't forward news myself and I generally disregard anything that appears to be ""clickbaity"". If real news breaks out I'll see it online somewhere....the last place I would look is television."
