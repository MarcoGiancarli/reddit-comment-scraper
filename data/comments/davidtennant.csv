davidtennant,3e39k0,rebelheart,4,Tue Jul 21 19:16:48 2015 UTC,Oooh - just changed my desktop to number 4. Many thanks x
davidtennant,3e39k0,notallthat,4,Tue Jul 21 21:16:32 2015 UTC,the last pic was in the header of this sub a few days ago
davidtennant,3e39k0,downForWho,5,Tue Jul 21 20:24:35 2015 UTC,I thought people wouldn't mind to see it a bit bigger ;)
davidtennant,3e39k0,rebelheart,3,Tue Jul 21 21:11:08 2015 UTC,Those pictures where he looks right at the camera just make me melt. And the just-got-out-of-bed tousled hair looks makes it even better.
davidtennant,3e39k0,catdoctor,4,Tue Jul 21 23:11:55 2015 UTC,Me toooo

davidtennant,3dw8il,poar,5,Mon Jul 20 02:07:20 2015 UTC,Thos should really be all pictures that exist of David
davidtennant,3dw8il,titsbefree,4,Mon Jul 20 16:45:11 2015 UTC,Mhmm. I especially love 3.
davidtennant,3dw8il,poar,5,Mon Jul 20 23:29:52 2015 UTC,Is he ever NOT being pretty?
davidtennant,3dw034,maybe_yes_but_no,6,Mon Jul 20 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"LA Without a Map....its towards the end (here's a link to the video, this part is about 50 seconds in)"

davidtennant,3dvhhi,maybe_yes_but_no,10,Sun Jul 19 21:34:44 2015 UTC,"""David is a down-to-earth, kind and fun guy, not to mention hilarious, and the two of you will make a great couple. Plus, have you seen his gorgeous HAIR?! You lucky duck, you!"" I did not need an Internet quiz to tell me this.Sobs softly."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,catdoctor,6,Sun Jul 19 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"I got DT! swoon  And Chandler, duh."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,suzypfonne,3,Mon Jul 20 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"Laughing at ""Joey or Chandler"""
davidtennant,3dvhhi,_oh_yes,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:40 2015 UTC,"I got Matt Smith!!! I am more than okay with this. He's closer in age to me anyway, and we share the same last name so I won't have to decide to change mine or not."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,bulk_barn,3,Mon Jul 20 01:01:57 2015 UTC,That escalated quickly.
davidtennant,3dvhhi,_oh_yes,3,Mon Jul 20 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've had debates with my friends over who's hotter between the two of them. Haha."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,bulk_barn,5,Mon Jul 20 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"When I see them side by side, I always pick David Tennant as the hotter one. But I'm stuck on who is my favorite doctor. I love them both equally."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,sipawhiskey,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't count anyone who thinks Matt Smith is hotter than David Tennant as a friend of mine. You have to hold up a few basic principles.
davidtennant,3dvhhi,rebelheart,3,Mon Jul 20 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Hahah! True, true. In some pics Matt looks like an alien, but then in others he's totally gorgeous. I have to find the worst pics of him I guess ;)"
davidtennant,3dvhhi,bulk_barn,5,Mon Jul 20 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"This is sort of how I describe Benedict Cumberbatch. Super hot, but also could be an alien."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,_oh_yes,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:07 2015 UTC,"I got David, but I'm so curious about how the questions are scored."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,vortex_time,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:38 2015 UTC,I thinks it's decided by the Joey of Chandler choice.
davidtennant,3dvhhi,bulk_barn,3,Mon Jul 20 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Neither Matt nor David are a Joey, so weird they'd make us choose haha."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,vortex_time,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"So I've been fiddling with it. If I change my original answers on both autumn/spring and Chandler/Joey I get Matt. Weirdly, the only thing that switches me from David to Matt with a single change is switching my coffee preferences to iced.  But it's the cookie/donut associations I really want to know! That was by far the hardest question."
davidtennant,3dvhhi,vortex_time,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:17 2015 UTC,Strange.  I switched all my answers except Joey/Chandler and got David.

davidtennant,3dtyyg,poar,3,Sun Jul 19 15:23:22 2015 UTC,"This was the Doctor Who special Never Mind The Buzzcocks. If you haven't seen it you should search YouTube, it's very funny."
davidtennant,3dtyyg,Valistia,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:52 2015 UTC,Really? I could've sworn it was one of his guest host roles for Friday Night Project. I probably got the names mixed up.
davidtennant,3dtyyg,poar,4,Sun Jul 19 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, look at the card he's holding. They're both hilarious episodes, but I just wanted to point out which show this was in case you've not seen it. It's worth a watch. :-)"
davidtennant,3dtyyg,Valistia,3,Sun Jul 19 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) yup, I've seen it, I was just thinking it was FNP."
davidtennant,3dtyyg,poar,2,Sun Jul 19 18:03:53 2015 UTC,I heard the following joke by one of my friends at a show. I was watching it with my fellow doctor who can friend. We still use it on each other 3 years later.  Knock knock  Who's there?  Doctor  Doctor who?  SHUT UP NERD!!!

davidtennant,3dqndh,0110110001101111,2,Sat Jul 18 19:57:14 2015 UTC,Georgia had to take care of the extensions the last time. She might have had to put her foot down...
davidtennant,3dqndh,catdoctor,4,Sat Jul 18 23:06:45 2015 UTC,Or he could grow his own hair out to about two feet and not bother with extensions and wigs anymore :)
davidtennant,3dqndh,rebelheart,5,Sat Jul 18 23:29:23 2015 UTC,It really is amazing how different he looks with short hair.

davidtennant,3da2zl,zunii,10,Tue Jul 14 18:03:06 2015 UTC,Also my favorite. I consider it a homage to my favorite TV series of all time: The Twilight Zone. I could practically hear Rod Serling's beginning and ending monologues.
davidtennant,3da2zl,bakerowl,4,Tue Jul 14 21:08:31 2015 UTC,This totally reminded me of Lifeboat.  I love that David is a Hitchcock fan as well.
davidtennant,3da2zl,maybe_yes_but_no,3,Tue Jul 14 22:40:10 2015 UTC,I read Love Boat. Was confused.

I have a British friend who gets very upset with me whenever I say such things.    I think the greatest thing about him  being able of play the Doctor is how well he's able to portray the emotions.  He made the Doctor the complex character he's meant to be.   Okay,  I'm done. :D"
davidtennant,3da2zl,poar,5,Tue Jul 14 20:35:35 2015 UTC,Scariest episode in my opinion.
davidtennant,3da2zl,razorbladecherry,4,Tue Jul 14 19:38:57 2015 UTC,It might just be. Silence in the Library gives me a bit of the heebie jeebies too though.
davidtennant,3da2zl,zunii,8,Tue Jul 14 19:45:11 2015 UTC,Tennant had the scariest episodes by far
davidtennant,3da2zl,Cookie92,2,Tue Jul 14 20:25:07 2015 UTC,Angles Take Manhatten is pretty scary too. But this one just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.  And soul.

davidtennant,3cmrbe,sacca7,11,Thu Jul 9 02:55:28 2015 UTC,Sooooo many questions!! Most of all...why white hair?? And did he have a Scottish accent? I know someone who met him because he came into Starbucks where she was working and she said it took her a while to recognize him because he was speaking with a Canadian accent or something ....
davidtennant,3cmrbe,bulk_barn,6,Thu Jul 9 04:31:53 2015 UTC,"He wasn't speaking a lot, as if to hide his voice. I was also focusing on my mom because... she need focusing on.  I felt he had the white hair to disguise himself, and he did a good job!"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,bulk_barn,3,Thu Jul 9 05:01:54 2015 UTC,"Weird, you'd think white hair on a guy his age would draw more attention!"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,4,Thu Jul 9 05:14:16 2015 UTC,I bet he has fun coming up with disguises.
davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,3,Thu Jul 9 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"I hope your mom is doing okay! It's kind of cool that she knew David from watching Broadchurch with you, so that you got to share the experience with her."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,titsbefree,3,Thu Jul 9 05:13:42 2015 UTC,"Was that while filming Gracepoint, or was it recently in NY?  Also, how does he take his coffee/tea!?  This girl needs to know... Lol"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,0110110001101111,5,Thu Jul 9 13:21:37 2015 UTC,Not the op but I vaguely know someone who worked in his local Costa in Crouch End and he used to come in for a black coffee most mornings.
davidtennant,3cmrbe,titsbefree,3,Thu Jul 9 13:51:56 2015 UTC,Haha.  I thought I heard somewhere it was black coffee!  Thanks :D
davidtennant,3cmrbe,maybe_yes_but_no,4,Thu Jul 9 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"In some interview somewhere I heard/read that he likes black coffee scalding hot.  I forget where, but he always has a cup when visiting Christian O'Connell."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,bulk_barn,3,Thu Jul 9 14:45:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was in Victoria, and I don't know what he ordered, haha. I assumed it was tea since he's British but also British people might hate Starbucks tea. I just know that he literally ran into the cafe, Doctor style and everyone who worked there was like Ahh!"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,maybe_yes_but_no,8,Thu Jul 9 15:22:36 2015 UTC,More questions:  Was the beard white as well?  Did he look like he had make up? or freckles?  Did the glasses look like these ones?
davidtennant,3cmrbe,maybe_yes_but_no,6,Thu Jul 9 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"The glasses were exactly like the ones in the picture, and the beard black, or very dark, hair.  I was totally never expecting to see him, much less in an elevator while taking my mom to a routine medical visit.   I feel very strongly it was him. Before we got on the elevator, I felt something about him (okay, he's he's got some persona, well... he's a DOCTOR)... and on the elevator, he didn't seem to know about Dr. Who or Broadchurch... I mean, I'm not a fangirl type, but even I know about these shows! And how could someone not know about them?   Then, to see him driving out--the parking area was not large, so anyone coming and going goes in and out one place-- he was really, really grinning! That was the clincher!. Those brown eyes...."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,maybe_yes_but_no,4,Thu Jul 9 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the beard thing is very intriguing indeed because if men go grey, it usually starts out in the beard.  Having white hair and a dark beard would be very unusual."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,0110110001101111,0,Thu Jul 9 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"Of course, whatever logic could point to this (beard black, hair white), it was not in my consciousness at the time. I was mindlessly in an elevator with my mom.   He did not seem to have any makeup on, to answer your earlier question.   Very clearly, white, white hair, and dark beard, typical of what we'd see in Broadchurch. I suspect the white hair was to disguise himself in public. It certainly threw me off. If his hair was dark.... I would have known instantly.   My only consolation is that I think I made his day!"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,4,Thu Jul 9 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"If he was grinning like that, you probably did.  On the other hand if it wasn't him, you made some random guys day, so that's not bad either.  :D"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,maybe_yes_but_no,2,Thu Jul 9 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"My mom agreed, he was grinning ear to ear. Almost laughing out loud to himself."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,3,Thu Jul 9 05:34:36 2015 UTC,"A full beard, or just thick stubble? Because he doesn't have a beard right now (see these pics for an example of his current look: http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/markcassidycbm/news/?a=122556#.VZ2oNoCHt88.reddit)."

davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,6,Thu Jul 9 03:37:45 2015 UTC,"I'm really not trying to be a spoilsport, but why would a man who never disguises himself suddenly decide to disguise himself for a visit to a med center.  Also, we know he didn't go grey overnight as he filmed two days ago with his luscious brown locks.  Also, the man grows a fast beard, but I doubt it grew in quite as thick as you're talking about in a days span.  And, last but not least, he was spotted less than 10 hours ago in NYC at a grocery store (which is when you submitted this).  Even with east and west coast time differences it makes little sense.  I do, on the other hand, think you should find this Tennant lookalike and pursue him with all your might! :D"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,0110110001101111,7,Thu Jul 9 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"It's still cool that someone who looks like DT will now go and check him out, and hopefully become a fan. :)"
davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,3,Thu Jul 9 13:50:24 2015 UTC,I just want to add here that he does use disguises all the time. Well he has used them in the past at any rate. Never heard of it in the US though.
davidtennant,3cmrbe,titsbefree,6,Fri Jul 10 14:21:27 2015 UTC,Only hats and dark glasses though. He's never used any other kind of disguise.
davidtennant,3cmrbe,Unique_Clone,7,Fri Jul 10 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"When he's being recognized. All the times he puts on a full face mask and dyes his hair grey, people think he's Peter Capaldi. It worked so well, he filmed half of the eighth season of Doctor Who instead of Peter because Peter had the measels. You can most notice it during the episode Flatline, the Doctor's hair changes length during that episode, the shorter hair is David in a wig."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,vortex_time,5,Fri Jul 10 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"That totally makes sense. And now he's handling the con appearance so Peter can do some top secret series nine filming.  Seriously, though, I am fully expecting that years from now in some interview we'll find out that he was in San Diego after all, and there's a logical explanation for the white hair."
davidtennant,3cmrbe,maybe_yes_but_no,6,Fri Jul 10 18:51:39 2015 UTC,Isn't it pretty much confirmed that DT was in NY at the time? Spotted both a few hours before the post and the day after.
davidtennant,3cmrbe,0110110001101111,2,Fri Jul 10 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about the day after spottings, but I think you usually have that info before I do."

I think the sideways look in the elevator, and the hair was thick and the same cut, just white, and the laughing in his car on top of just not knowing who David Tennant was ... and his accent, it was him.   Also, San Diego is a great vacation spot.    Let's see if he shows up at Comic Con.   Next time I'm in that facility, I'll ask at the desk where I saw him walk from. Their smiles, or lack thereof, will tell me."

davidtennant,3cgi7y,vortex_time,2,Tue Jul 7 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"Do you think he does the vocal entirely himself in this clip of the genie singing? The lead-in sounds like him, but I wonder if another artist switches in for the second line, like in Disney films that have different speaking and singing voices for the characters.  (On a second listen, do you think he actually sings at all in this?)"
davidtennant,3cgi7y,vortex_time,3,Tue Jul 7 23:47:05 2015 UTC,"The singing definitely sounds like him...There may be some sound effects added in, but I think it's him singing. We know he can sing from past projects, so I don't see why there'd be a different artist taking over for a few seconds of song."
davidtennant,3cgi7y,Valistia,2,Wed Jul 8 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"What makes me wonder, though I don't pretend to have a trained ear, is the tone and power starting around :17. His voice in other projects is pleasant and light, but it doesn't have that professional quality. If it is him, well done, David :)    Edit: No one else credited on imdb, so it must be him. I'm impressed!"
davidtennant,3cgi7y,vortex_time,2,Wed Jul 8 01:19:19 2015 UTC,It's very much David. And it's not like that Evil Genie song needs a singer with a vocal range of three octaves ;)
davidtennant,3cgi7y,rebelheart,2,Wed Jul 8 07:32:55 2015 UTC,I should just accept that he can do everything :)

He is not being paid, and he has not consented to having his picture taken. The guy is entitled to a private life. We are huge fans and we appreciate his work. We should, therefor, respect his privacy and not make him feel like he is on display every minute of every day."
davidtennant,3b74g8,catdoctor,2,Fri Jun 26 17:24:42 2015 UTC,At least they didn't ask for a photo at an airport like this person https://instagram.com/p/4ZiFh9v7hD/

Here's an Radio Times article from February (with series two spoilers!) that claims they will begin shooting this summer and the series will be released at earliest in autumn of 2016.    I'm curious to see which direction they take the story next."

davidtennant,3b53du,vortex_time,2,Fri Jun 26 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"Heh, I think he enjoys teasing the media in his Broadchurch interviews. Have you watched The Escape Artist yet? It's a three-episode mini-series that you can get through Amazon Instant. It's not Broadchurch, but it might help the craving for crime and legal drama, and David is, as always, very good in it."

davidtennant,3b53du,vortex_time,5,Fri Jun 26 02:45:02 2015 UTC,"Although not as good, mainly because it is mostly just a copy, it still is worth watching.  David proves very capable of doing an American accent in spite of the British press relentlessly printing and reprinting the two or three tweets claiming otherwise.  I personally think that was just a great big effort on their part to undermine anything he does stateside so that they can keep him for their own.  It's too late now... it's time to share!"

davidtennant,3b53du,bulk_barn,2,Fri Jun 26 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"Plus, some of these are the same papers that whined about his Scottish accent in Broadchurch series two, so it's pretty hard to take them seriously."
davidtennant,3b53du,vortex_time,2,Fri Jun 26 04:05:13 2015 UTC,"Its David.  Its fine.  He does many different accents and the media took jabs at his American attempt, but really its very good and East Coast-y."
davidtennant,3b53du,rebelheart,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"Except it was supposed to be set in the Pacific Northwest :p.  His accent sounded fine to me but then again I am basically tone deaf and can barely distinguish accents other than my own and a French Canadian one. However, there was also an Aussie in the cast (the trailer park lady) who in my opinion did a more believable accent. But neither of them are as good as Hugh Laurie's American accent House! That is impressive!"

davidtennant,3ax4jr,costlyideas,5,Wed Jun 24 05:17:11 2015 UTC,"I love this scene. Every tiny detail is perfect: David's strut, his gradual de-costuming, complete with throwing the eyebrow ring at the kid, the dimples in his lower back, and the way he says: ""Mmm. I'm gonna pop your cherry!"" What I love about this movie is that Peter Vincent could have been played ""flat"" and still been effective. All we really needed was the blowhard pseudo-vampire hunter who is really a coward. But David gives us so much more! His performance is nuanced and, even at his campiest, rooted in real emotion. Taking a stock role like this and breathing real life into it is master-class acting."
davidtennant,3ax4jr,catdoctor,3,Wed Jun 24 13:11:43 2015 UTC,AGGH BACK DIMPLES. Seriously though he was great in it.  Especially towards the end when he gets more screen time. I might need a Midori sour now.

davidtennant,39vpcz,vortex_time,2,Mon Jun 15 14:38:02 2015 UTC,"Whoa, can we talk for a second about the background image on this page? If it were just looped a little more smoothly, I could watch it for hours. (And let's not pretend I haven't invested a good chunk of time anyway.)"
davidtennant,39vpcz,rebelheart,2,Mon Jun 15 22:01:36 2015 UTC,Yuuuup :3
davidtennant,39vpcz,vortex_time,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:15:42 2015 UTC,What background image? I'm still seeing Nick as the background pic on all pages of this subreddit?
davidtennant,39uhib,poar,3,Sun Jun 14 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"I sent him something in November (winter?), and nothing.  I'm certain it was just me, tho, because there's a website somewhere where people post their autograph success'. People who sent in stuff after me still got stuff back.  BUT!  I also couldn't figure out how to SASE UK-US, so there was no return postage on it.  I had called his agent ahead of time, and they said it wasn't a problem -- but it must have been, cause I got nothing to show for that letter! Lol. As a funny aside; my friend and I felt bad for the lack of SASE so we pooled our bills together and sent them to David in the package.  We sent Mr. Tennant $4.  :P"
davidtennant,39uhib,titsbefree,2,Sun Jun 14 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"lol, nice, nice. I wonder about the SASE from the US... I feel like agents could afford the equivalent of a $0.28 stamp -____-"
davidtennant,39uhib,titsbefree,2,Mon Jun 15 00:14:50 2015 UTC,"Welllll it does cost more than just a stamp to mail a picture from the UK to the US.  Heck, it cost about $15 just to mail the letter, envelope, and CD to David.  You could really just send an 8x10 in an 8x10 (folded) and I imagine that would work.  Somewhere I read to send a postcard sized envelope (so that's what I did)-- maybe that was my mistake????  Honestly, your best bet is to call his talent agency and ask them SPECIFICALLY what needs to be sent.  If they don't know, than no one does.  Lol. On the positive side, they have lovely English accents at his agency! :-D"

davidtennant,39uhib,titsbefree,6,Mon Jun 15 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"Heh, should we put this in our AMA questions? ""What's the best album you've ever received from a fan?"""

davidtennant,39stlm,maybe_yes_but_no,5,Sun Jun 14 18:18:01 2015 UTC,I feel the same.
davidtennant,39stlm,catdoctor,6,Sun Jun 14 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"I love watching this. David's face is so expressive: how his face lights up when he sees a co-star, you can just see how much he cares about Olivia and Billie and Katherine. He is so proud when Olivia does the scene in the police station and has to sheepishly admit she leaked information to the media. The little smirk he does when they say that The Doctor is the role he was born to play! How he reacts to his Dad being on screen. I also love watching Georgia throughout the video. How much she enjoys his surprise when he realizes the prize goes to him. How she strokes his shoulder, and his arm, especially when he is looking at his Dad in the video. She has tears in her eyes throughout the video, too, and you can tell she is so proud of him. I know they keep their marriage private, as they should, but I love this little glimpse into their relationship. It makes me happy to know he has such a supportive and loving partner."
davidtennant,39stlm,bulk_barn,2,Sun Jun 14 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"I love how sitting there laughing to herself and he's looking at her like, what's wrong with you??! She must be awful at poker."

And for those of you in the UK who might not support this, please don't forget how miserable the rest of the world is with television broadcasting.  I still remember the Olympic coverage by BBC being so much better than anywhere else.  And privatized news should make you shudder even at the thought of losing the BBC.

davidtennant,396vcy,bibiane,3,Tue Jun 9 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Fox News is the Rupert Murdoch owned news channel which airs primarily conservative biased news.  But it is more than that.  They've been known to take comments by the President and others  completely out of context.  To be fair, all news stations do that.  But they go to extremes like blatently make up ""facts"" like this one made by an ""expert on terrorism"": ""Birmingham (the one in Britain) is a 'Muslim-only city' where non-Muslims 'don't go'"".  The guy was immediately lambasted on Twitter.  Fox News only apologized about a week later after being called out by all sorts of British media.   I cringe knowing that there are people out there that take their slant on news as fact.  Even I admit that most media here in the US has a liberal slant, but Fox News goes off the deep end in the other direction."
