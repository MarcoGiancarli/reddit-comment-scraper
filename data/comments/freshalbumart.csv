It was published sometime between 1830 and 1833  in the late Edo period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (ÂØåÂ∂Ω‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠ÊôØ, Fugaku sanj≈´rokkei ?). It is Hokusai's most famous work, and one of the best recognized works of Japanese art in the world. It depicts an enormous wave threatening boats off the coast of the prefecture of Kanagawa. While sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is, as the picture's title suggests, more likely to be a large rogue wave or okinami (""wave of the open sea"").  As in all the prints in the series, it depicts the area around Mount Fuji under particular conditions, and the mountain itself appears in the background.

freshalbumart,31b0dw,ARTISTIC_ASSHOLE,7,Fri Apr 3 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"Here I come... The berry and text could've done with some treating of blur.  For the text, add an outer glow at around 2pts (or the pixel equivalent of what your canvas size is) with the same color as the text, and set the opacity to 100%. This will create a glow/blur effect which will do a lot to get rid of the ""digitalized"" effect and make it seem more realistic. I would then make a copy, rasterize it, and then add 2,5% noise or more.  For the berry, make a layer copy and add 3-8px of Gaussian blur and raise the contrast. Then use Levels to crunch the blacks by moving the slider a bit to the left.   To finish off, add a cooling filter with ""Photo Filters"" to give it a slightly blue hue, decrease this with the slider if there's too much saturation. Apply the image to a new layer on top, add 11% of noise and then filter it with ""Lighten""."

freshalbumart,30z8km,Tilktilk5,4,Tue Mar 31 22:07:32 2015 UTC,Is this vaporwave? I really like this album cover.
freshalbumart,30z8km,whoopingchow,3,Tue Mar 31 22:40:24 2015 UTC,Thanks! Its Japanese Disco but I felt like this works as well. When I made it I was thinking of vaporwave.
freshalbumart,30z8km,whoopingchow,3,Tue Mar 31 22:51:35 2015 UTC,I like it a lot!
freshalbumart,30z8km,BakefastatPiffanys,3,Tue Mar 31 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"Christ that's sinister. Is the album sinister at all? Intrigued by the album now, which is the best thing I can say about album art. Nicely done!"

freshalbumart,30z8km,ARTISTIC_ASSHOLE,3,Wed Apr 1 00:22:16 2015 UTC,What's the actual album called
freshalbumart,30w5bt,iAMBOUTiT,7,Tue Mar 31 04:41:04 2015 UTC,Dog with a Grip
freshalbumart,30w5bt,LegoWaffles,4,Tue Mar 31 05:00:56 2015 UTC,I don't get it. Can someone explain?
freshalbumart,30w5bt,dyna-mic,4,Tue Mar 31 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"(I'm assuming)These are the characters from a ""popular"" Disney Show named ""Dog with a Blog"". And the main character, the dog, has some sort of blog, or something. So that's basically what I've learned from watching a commercial of it. Oh well"
freshalbumart,30w5bt,MuyChingonGuey,3,Tue Mar 31 15:19:38 2015 UTC,Is... is the show still running?

freshalbumart,30w5bt,JussaiLLusion,2,Tue Mar 31 22:08:42 2015 UTC,He uses it one time and it's in the title of the show?
freshalbumart,30w5bt,ZeroCitizen,3,Tue Mar 31 22:41:17 2015 UTC,I mean once per episode

freshalbumart,30w5bt,madlate,2,Tue Mar 31 20:56:50 2015 UTC,I dont get it
freshalbumart,30ps8y,BlunderBear,3,Sun Mar 29 17:29:00 2015 UTC,this kinda makes it look like an electro-pop album
freshalbumart,30ps8y,CasterMojave,2,Thu Apr 2 03:54:38 2015 UTC,Ehh not what I was going for. Bummer
freshalbumart,30ps8y,CasterMojave,3,Thu Apr 2 05:43:53 2015 UTC,Jazz was the other thing I thought of if that was it.

freshalbumart,30g3k8,ZeroCitizen,15,Sat Mar 28 21:16:16 2015 UTC,When I heard the title to this album I immediately thought of this episode. I've never made an alt album cover but I felt like I just had to do this one.
freshalbumart,30g6p9,FappingDuck,5,Fri Mar 27 02:30:07 2015 UTC,Clever. I could see OF actually making this.

freshalbumart,30htng,ZeroCitizen,5,Sat Mar 28 04:18:58 2015 UTC,Taking an image that was originally 210x210 and stretching it over a 2100x2100 blank layer. That wolf head was extremely difficult to find

freshalbumart,302x5g,melanch0ly_,2,Tue Mar 24 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"I like it, but do you have the image with smaller font or just the image itself. The text just takes up a shit ton of the cover in the original. If not, all good, still nice."

freshalbumart,302x5g,serenefiendninja,5,Tue Mar 24 17:52:45 2015 UTC,Better than the original? I dont think so IMO. The text looks amatuer in this cover.

freshalbumart,2yg08p,NebraskaRanger,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"I like this place because it's where graphic designers can come and share they're alternative artwork and receive feedback.  Now, I don't know if you are a professional graphic designer or if you just do this for fun, but I'll speak from a graphic designer standpoint and hope you can understand what I'm throwing at you.  Design wise: It's great, I really like the bandanas acting as a border of some sorts, especially with how well it goes with the song.  Typography wise: This is the only part where I think it could use a little help. Typography is a tricky bastard. 90% of the time it can make or break a design. In your case, it doesn't quite break the design, but I just felt like there was a little more than you could do with it. You could possibly multiply the layer, you'll probably lose it with that dark background, but you just duplicate the layer, turn off multiply, and then adjust the opacity to help the words shine through in contrast.   Those are my only things, man. Other than that, I love the design. Fits the song well. If you're ever needing more criticism from a designer before you throw it up and let the whole world see, just PM me and we can work together."
freshalbumart,2yfzez,thegr8vabwavo,2,Mon Mar 9 14:24:27 2015 UTC,How do you guys put the effect on the cover so that it looks old/faded?
freshalbumart,2yfzez,cinman273,2,Mon Mar 9 20:03:09 2015 UTC,im new here but id guess probably a low opacity gray layer and an off white thin brush for the crease/dust/fold marks
