Monitors,3e4x4b,metalhoney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:20 2015 UTC,"You have a few options. You can definitely get two matching 24“ monitors with that budget.   There are two basic ways to go with monitors - IPS/PLS/AHVA monitors,  which are beautiful to look at, but with a slightly more delayed response time, or TN monitors, which are much faster, but look a little more washed out. TN monitors are better for first person shooters and ""twitch"" style games, while IPS will look better for pretty games. Anything 1080p or 1440p from a name brand will be at least 60hz, its only at 4k where the refresh rate gets dicey.  If you go with TN, people will usually recommend also getting 144hz, since it will also helps with the speed of input-to-display. Unfortunately,  144hz monitors start at $200, so you wouldn't be able to have matching monitors for your price range.   Since you mentioned skyrim and minecraft though, I would probably recommend IPS/PLS/AHVA panels. In my experience, Samsung, LG, Acer, and Dell are all decent brands. Unfortunately microcenter doesn't list the panel type in their spec list, but the boxes at the store should usually list them (or you can try google).  I personally found it really nice to just try out the monitors at the store. I ended up selling my matching 24"" monitors to buy a single Acer K272HUL 1440p 27“ AHVA panel for $329, and am very happy with the 1440p resolution and larger display.  On a side note, if you have a graphics card, you really shouldn't use the motherboard graphics ports, so you will have to stick with the different outputs on your r9. Most any monitor you get will support multiple input types though, so that shouldn't be a problem to find monitors that match."

So you should do some research first to see if its worthwhile for you.  This is the QNIX 27"" 1440p monitor. It uses PLS, which is slightly better than IPS.  The housing is cheap, but you're really paying for the display.  My monitor was $230 shipped (20% off ebay coupon, no longer available), but I think its a good deal even up to $270.  My monitor overclocked to 110Hz. There is one pixel stuck on green (located to the right center) but I can't spot it unless I'm close to the screen and looking for it.

In short TN, IPS and VA are technologies used in monitors. TN are fast and cheap but poor colours and contrast, IPS have accurate colours and decent contrast but expensive, VA has average colours and great contrast but low avaibility. 1440p is a resolution (2560x1440) which is how many pixels the screen have. The higher it is the more details you can see. Full HD is 1080p, HD Ready is 720. G-Sync is Nvidia proprietary technology for adaptive sync (avoid tearing). 2ms response time is very low, under 10ms is good enough for regular use. 144Hz means the monitor will display a max of 144 frames per second. Most movies are in 24fps for reference.    Considering your uses and build I'd suggest 1440p AMVA 27"" but that's outside your price range by a lot (500€). You can get a 24"" 1080p MVA for relatively cheap (like so). There are plenty of other good monitors under 200€ but the lack of trusted reviews can make it hard to find."

That being said, most AAA titles will work fine, and ultrawide can be pretty immersive. So while it's probably not ideal for gaming, it's probably fine."

There are tiny ducts on the inner rim of your eye-lids that secrete moisture onto your eyeballs. These often get blocked, in bad cases they can result in sties. You can unblock them by taking a cotton wool pad, like a makeup removal pad, running it under hot water and then pressing the wet pad against your closed eye. This will help loosen the build up. You can wipe the inside of your eyelid's edges as well to get rid of what's there. Do this for a few days and it should improve the state of your eyes and reduce dryness."
Monitors,3e11ds,Mikebike6,2,Tue Jul 21 03:19:34 2015 UTC,"Some things you should consider:   The Skyrim/Fallout engine is incompatible with higher frame rates. You will have to cap your display at 60hz when in game or the physics goes crazy. A 970 should be able to push older games/non-AAA games at 120+ fps. However, it will struggle with more graphically intense games on higher settings, especially at 1440p. This is less relevant if you can get a gsync monitor, which for the most part skipped 1080p.

Working I can very comfortably have two windows side by side and it is amazing for gaming. You get a wider view than a single panel and you don't have 5760x1080 issues that some games have.

Monitors,3dyvgd,umbrazon,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"I've used the 29um65, but recently sold it for a 34um95. I do love the ultrawides, but only since I don't have a lot of desk room. Ideally, a 144hz 16:9 and a supplementary monitor would be perfect.  I haven't come across any real game issues except the first borderlands. Most others work out of the box (alien isolation, gtav, cs:go, borderlands 2). Even if they don't, flawless widescreen fixes up most HUD scaling and fov problems like for farcry 3 and Skyrim.  My biggest gripe is that the 29 inch is really quite small compared to 27 inch 1440p. If you are coming from ~24 inch 1080p, it is a great intermediary for moving up to a 34inch 1440p later. If you do go to 34 though, it is huge. I never saw the need for a curved screen, but after using a straight 34 for two weeks now, I can see why.  3440x1440 needs a lot of power though. I have a 280x and few games can be anywhere near max. Along with the extra gpu horsepower needed, ultrawide does have a price premium.  Curved is a nice to have, not a need to have. But I highly recommend you look at one with a height/pivot adjustable stand. The stock LG ones are horrendous, and these monitors can take a bit of wiggling to get perfect."

I also strongly recommend getting it mounted on flexible vesa mount so you can adjust the monitor exactly as you like.   A word about LG34UM97.

Monitors,3dyvgd,Sylanthra,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"i think the main reason why 21:9 hasnt caught on is because of how established 16:9 is in television.  you have lcd panel companies all producing mainly 16:9 tvs, cable companies that support 16:9 standard, online content like netflix/youtube, etc.    i dont think 21:9 will be popular for a long time, and i dont think it will be cheap for  a long while either.    but it is better than 16:9 in almost every way.  you can see more content in games and movies and its much easier to drive than 4k."
Monitors,3dyvgd,e6600,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:14 2015 UTC,I personally don't see the appeal of them in many situations as for less money you can just get a 4k monitor and run a custom ultrawide resolution with black bars giving you most of the benefits of ultrawide.     However you do lose out on aesthetics with size and IPS/TN/VA depending on the monitor so they aren't a bad option if you want a large high resolution IPS monitor.

Monitors,3dyla6,Xeroph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:48 2015 UTC,I think the only one that exists is the Acer Predator. Although Asus is coming out with PG279Q in the fall probably.
Monitors,3dyla6,Cereaza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Predator is the one I got. It's the best monitor that doesn't compromise in my opinion. 4K has tradeoffs with IPS/refresh/variable refresh. 1440 is the highest resolution panel that has yet to make that compromise. And the predator currently is the only one on the market with zero promises, other than price."
Monitors,3dyla6,Xeroph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:05 2015 UTC,Ya you're right it seems that 1440p is the resolution where you don't have to compromise on Refresh rate and Gsync. Once Displayport 1.3 becomes widely adopted then there will be enough bandwidth to do 4k at higher refresh rates. I can't wait.
Monitors,3dyla6,Cereaza,2,Mon Jul 20 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"eh. 60hz isn't the real killer for me at 4K. It's getting 4K, 30""+, G-sync, and IPS all together. But yeah, in a few years with Pascal and stronger cards, 4k at 60hz might become a bottleneck for flagship cards. Gonna need higher bandwidth connectors and higher refresh rate panels.   I can't wait either."

But it really depends on what you're going to use the two side 1080p's for. Editing, or just productivity? Do you want them to be the same size as your center monitor? IPS? I spent most of my time researching the 4K/1440 market, so i'm no consumer expert in 1080p."

If you get easily annoyed by things like this I'd stay away from different resulution monitors used at once in general.  Also, do make sure you have the horsepower to run 3 144hz 1440p monitors, especially if you want to be gaming at that resolution.

Monitors,3dykvj,DrewChrist87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:02 2015 UTC,"So basically you would need a road case if this is the route you want to go. That place does custom ones for cheap, $99 I think.   You could do it one of a couple ways that I see;   Design a custom case that just needs to house a 2U or 3U rack chassis. Newegg has some here. Make sure the chassis you pick supports a mini-ATX (thought they were micro-ATX and mini-ITX?). If you want a big graphics card, like, normal sized ones, you would need a 16x16 PCIE riser cable   Basically that lets you mount the GPU flat to save vertical space for your case.   Then, you'll also want to get a thin monitor with VESA mounting holes. It helps if this monitor also has the video inputs/power on the bottom facing up like this to save space. We used two of these 22"" Asus monitors for big TriCaster case you saw in the gallery above. You could take off the plastic molding, I believe, because the VESA mounting holes should go well through the plastic into the metal frame surrounding the monitor.  I should also mention that in setups like this, you'll want to liquid cool your CPU, as well as leave room above the chassis with your computer in it for fans like this.    This should be enough info to get you pointed in the right direction. PM me if you have any other questions regarding this. I'd be happy to try and help.  Oh, almost forgot! The other way would be something like this where you just build the computer in a regular case, and put it in a road/flight case and somehow integrate the monitor lid how the other designs showed."

The top games dont even go above 90 hz anyway with today's graphics cards unless you sli\ crossfire. Friend yesterday mentioned how great the colors pop on it.

I haven't noticed any backlight bleeding but then again I am bad at spotting that.   I don't have any regrets with the monitor. If you are picky about the backlight bleed and get one that has a lot of it, you can always RMA it. It is definitely worth the savings over the other 1440p 144hz IPS displays"

I want one of those, so I am being persistent in returning the monitors if they are not up to par. This monitor is too FANTASTIC(and too expensive) to settle for anything less. Plus ASUS needs to see these returns/RMAs/customer reviews so that they know to improve their product. A few deadpixels I can deal with, but the combination of that with the backlight bleed is unforgivable. Not at that price point. Don't settle if you get one that doesnt look great.

You will only see the benefits of a 144Hz monitor if you can get above 60FPS, and yes, 60FPS@144hz looks juddery, since some frames will have to be shown twice (or thrice) while others don't. It will feel irregular, so just lock it at 60Hz. If you're buying a new monitor, I still suggest a 144Hz monitor, as a monitor is not something you just upgrade here and then.

Regardless, you should go with the Asus anyway, since it has lightboost, and has a lot of reputation among the 144hz community as the best non-BenQ 1080p 144hz monitor.  Lightboost limits the refresh rate to 120hz, and lowers the brightness a bit, but it drastically decreases motion blur, which I would recommend for CS:GO. For example, when doing a flick shot w/ the AWP (I assume that you are playing csgo, sorry if im wrong), then you can see with great clarity what you are aiming at while moving the crosshair quickly."

Yep.  If the target is moving and you track it while it's moving. Then the target appears clearer.  That's the reason why you benefit from it.  The way you do it is the typical scenario where blur reduction does make a significant difference.

I went with the Sakwa (60hz!) mostly because I like glossy monitors and have no interest in overclocking. The edge to edge glass and plasma deposition coating were also enticing. It's pretty much a Thunderbolt display stripped of features and DisplayPort.

This seems like a beautiful monitor.

Again, not something I find noticeable."

Monitors,3dtt0l,Philosofikal,2,Sun Jul 19 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"What you are describing sounds a lot like tearing. Tearing happens due to the card writing to the video buffer at the same time the monitor is updating the image on the screen. If the card is writing at the same time, you end up with two images being displayed at once. The two images being slightly off will look like a horizontal line. If the timing of the card and video aren't in sync, that horizontal line will move up and down as well.  Try turning on V-sync in the games this occurs in. You might also want to turn on triple buffering too, or it can have a large impact on your FPS if it's lower than your refresh rate."

What I like about the XG270HU is the freesync range 40-144hz, by having these range for me the game is a little more fluid compare to the Asus MG279Q since the range is higher. The build quality of Acer is flimsy and wobbly. I feel that the quality is sub par.  The Asus on the other hand has superior build quality, vesa compatible and can do portrait if you ever so desire to do triple monitor. Now since this Asus is IPS, I find the picture quality much more pronounce than XG270HU. I find the 35-90hz range odd but since playing the recent release AAA games it is hard to max it at 144hz with everything on. Having a 35 as the lower limit has proven to be useful for me since sometimes my fps dips as low as 35.  In the end I decided to keep the MG279Q for its build quality and better picture quality. Hope my little insight helps."
Monitors,3dtfqe,6th_Trader,2,Sun Jul 19 10:12:19 2015 UTC,Your only option at the moment is the MG279Q from Asus and that is 600 dollars right now. It's pretty much the ideal high-end gaming monitor except it lacks lightboost.

Monitors,3dqzp1,Birdy88,10,Sat Jul 18 16:47:24 2015 UTC,"At the current time, Freesync isn't a standard, it's a G-SYNC competitor. Even though it's present in the VESA standard, it's widespread adoption depends heavily on across-the-board adoption from all Displayport participants especially including NVidia. So, until you get both Team Red and Team Green to agree on how to do adaptive sync, there's no standard.  (Intel will probably support Freesync/VESA Adaptive Sync, but they are a non-player in desktop graphics which is the target market for adaptive-sync technologies.)  As for windowed mode, the way it works on modern operating systems is that there's a special process called the compositor which renders the desktop the same way your games render things. It's the reason why you run ever so slightly slower in windowed mode as opposed to exclusive fullscreen (the one that freaks out when you alt-tab). So Microsoft would have to update DWM to support adaptive sync.  That would actually be a bit of a challenge. Say you have two games running at different framerates: one at 40 and one at 55. DWM would need to schedule additional frames based on when they come in from other applications attached to that desktop. Ultimately, both applications are going to be forced to update at ""compatible"" framerates that don't require refreshes faster than the monitor can do.  Going back to the two applications, there are going to be points in time where they present frames at awkward intervals. It's reasonable for DWM to wait some number of microseconds for additional presentations to come in. But eventually it has to refresh the monitor to do it's job, after which anything that comes later will be delayed until the monitor is ready to accept another frame.  In practice, I would imagine applications would wind up having lots of microstutter-like problems if they rendered at different rates, eventually locking to some multiple of the slower application's refresh rate that the monitor did support. This would be less noticeable on monitors that supported higher framerates. But it's something that would still require tuning.  (I'm also forgetting to mention that DWM's primary job is managing applications that don't periodically refresh, i.e. productivity software. In that case, DWM would need to schedule periodic refreshes of it's own to avoid falling below the minimum refresh times of the monitor and causing the picture to fade out.)  It's the kind of thing that isn't impossible, but Microsoft wouldn't bother doing until adaptive sync became a broadly supported ecosystem worth their engineering time. Exclusive fullscreen mode is comparatively easy because DWM is out of the picture and monitor refreshes are scheduled entirely by that one process; so it can be done by the driver vendors."

Monitors,3dqzp1,ThatActuallyGuy,-6,Sat Jul 18 17:16:32 2015 UTC,Woopsy do.  Everyone keeps blabbing about how much better gsync is.  Who cares.  So nvidia shouldn't have a problem supporting free sync then since there option is so much better.  Then people can choose a monitor and not be stuck with whatever gpu there Dam monitor supports. When display port 1.3 comes out and adaptive sync is a standard nvidia would have to be down right dogs not to support it.
Monitors,3dqzp1,Roboloutre,3,Sat Jul 18 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"The people who care are the ones dropping $700 on a monitor, which I imagine is a higher ratio than normal in this sub. And no company is going to support competing technology unless something forces them to. Bottom line, adaptive sync is still an optional part of the DP standard, until it's required Nvidia will have no interest in including it.  Also, most tests point to G-Sync having next to zero ghosting while Freesync has quite a bit [recently improved with drivers, but not on par yet]. Then there's the aspect where G-Sync can manage frame doubling to stay within a monitor's refresh range when FPS dips [VERY helpful with 144Hz monitors, as their refresh range can very possibly bottom out at what's still a fairly high refresh rate], as it entirely replaces the monitor's scalar with one that directly communicates with the GPU. Freesync is just working around whatever scalar is in current monitors, so it can't control things quite as deeply. This scalar is why G-Sync monitors cost more, it's not merely a cash grab.  I fully believe Adaptive sync will catch up and this will be standard technology in a few years rendering G-Sync obsolete, but that'll require new monitors and DP standards [and possibly GPU's], and until then there's no arguing that currently the best experience by far is found with G-Sync.  Edit: For the record I've been an AMD faithful for over 10 years since I grabbed an ATI Radeon 9250 at a Walmart while I was in highschool to play Call of Duty 2, and am currently running an HD 7850."

Monitors,3dqzp1,2FastHaste,0,Sat Jul 18 19:03:51 2015 UTC,The claim to fame for gsync is it keeps doubling up the frames. Say the monitor is 60gz. So when your fps reaches say 30fps it displays the same frame twice and makes the refresh rate 60hz again. Then when the fps hits 15fps it displays the frame 4 times in a row and makes the refresh rate 60hz again. Free sync fails miserably atm once you go below the minimum range of the monitor as it  can't do this. But that has nothing to do with why nvidia can't support free sync.

Ultrasharps are best for video editing and photo. For movies/shows, browsing and RPGs MVA will be better due to the high contrast ratio. A good example would be the BenQ EW2440L, same panel as the Dell S2440L. Black will look black, grey will be grey, dark grey will be dark grey and not black, and white will be white.

I'd hazard a guess that there isn't much profit margin for a fairly saturated and established 22-24inch 1080p market, if you were in introduce free/Gsync in.  Furthermore, popular upper-mid range cards like the R9 290/GTX970, which usually only get 45fps+ in AAA games at 1440p, match well with Free/Gsync, as it starts being very effective around 45fps."

Monitors,3dnhy0,ArmyAg08,2,Fri Jul 17 18:32:31 2015 UTC,Photo editing is the most demanding of the two uses so I'd go with a Dell Ultrasharp. If she does a lot of black and white an MVA panel will be good but those are a bit rare and they don't come in many sizes (it's also great for video games !).
Monitors,3dnhy0,Roboloutre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:38:55 2015 UTC,MVA?  EDIT: What benefits would a Dell Ultrasharp offer over this model?
Monitors,3dnhy0,Roboloutre,2,Sat Jul 18 06:00:02 2015 UTC,Dell Ultrasharps generally have the best uniformity and accuracy and they often come with a stand that can do portrait mode. If you want to see reviews TFTcentral has plenty of them for Ultrasharps and high end gaming monitors.     The site I wanted to link is down so here is a huge list of monitors with pivot that are IPS or PLS.

Monitors,3dmlva,aRevin,2,Fri Jul 17 14:27:46 2015 UTC,100Hz lightboost will be harsher on the eyes than 120Hz lightboost.  100fps at 100Hz is slightly less fluid than 120fps at 120Hz.  There is not much else to say really.
Monitors,3dmlva,2FastHaste,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:31:28 2015 UTC,It depends on what you need. It's difficult to tell the difference between 120fps and 144fps. What you may end up noticing the most is the dramatic reduction of motion blur at the cost of screen brightness and perceived flickering. You'll have to find out what works for oyu.
Monitors,3dmlva,Clob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:55 2015 UTC,Fluidity wise it's almost identical. It's a little harder on the eyes since at times the flicker is visible.

Monitors,3dltdx,Ash-OC,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"Related Question:  In your guys experience, is the ""smoothness"" of a 144hz noticeable for MMO's, MOBA's, and Strategy Games (Such as X-COM)?  I absolutely see where it matters for FPS's but I'm curious if I'll see a significant difference for the games I listed (Basically the one's I usually play)"
Monitors,3dltdx,AssCrackBanditHunter,5,Fri Jul 17 12:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yes it is.  There is a simple law to figure it out.  If the game you play has objects or camera viewpoint moving at at least 144 pixels per second. (basically the vast majority of games that exist)  Then you would be taking FULL advantage of a 144hz monitor.   This is due to motion artifacts such as persistence based eye tracking motion blur and stroboscopic stepping.  This post: http://www.avsforum.com/forum/40-oled-technology-flat-panels-general/1484182-why-we-need-1000fps-1000hz-century-valve-software-michael-abrash-comments.html  has a nice explanation of those 2 artifacts.  tldr;   yes even for games where motion is significantly slower than in FPS games, it still benefits completely from 144hz.  When you follow something that move on the screen it will appear less blurry than on the 60Hz monitor. (Especially useful in RTS)   See this: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates-text  You see how the text on the left is easier to read. That's because the eye tracking motion blur is exactly 2 times lower than the one on the right. Now imagine the right one with 144/60 times less amount of blur.  ok my tldr is becoming too long."

Monitors,3dltdx,Alluringskull,2,Fri Jul 17 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"144hz is good even when your games are running at 40-60fps because usually at low fps, your frame variance can be wonky, and 144hz monitors take a dump on frame variance. You see every single frame the game throws at you.   Also fps games in general look uncannily real"

It's about 630€ here. But for me IPS is more important than 144Hz. I would say if you are playing games competitively chose the higher refresh rate, if you work with colours, enjoy better viewing angles and are happy enough with 60hz go for ips. I initially wanted the Asus PB278Q (1440p,IPS, 60Hz) for 450€ and had already enough but then just done my best to get those 200€ more and get the ""upgrade"".

Monitors,3dl9uq,Suyneej,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:39:36 2015 UTC,"I just got an XB270HU on Amazon for $750.  It's amazing.  The build date is May 2015, and I believe they have fixed the QC issues.  Mine is perfect and I'm really sensitive to BLB.  With that said, I also own two U2515h 1440p 60hz monitors.  The XB270HU needed some changes to color accuracy, but after I did that, it is incredible.   I also have a 980 Ti.  Going from 90 FPS in GTAV in the city to 45 FPS in an open field with tons of grass really didn't feel jarring like it did without Gsync.  I'm amazed at the difference and the smoothness that 144hz provides in games where I can achieve that framerate.  144hz and Gsync is a game changer for me.  I'm really surprised by the difference, and I don't think I'll ever own a 60hz non-adaptive sync monitor again.  Around two years ago I bought a Qnix 1440p monitor.  It was plagued with horrendous BLB.  It was so bad that I took the monitor apart and tried a couple of fixes that people recommended such as bending the metal frame and applying electrical tape.  Nothing worked.  I ended up throwing it in the trash after a few days because returning it to Korea was proving to be a headache.  I figured $275 wasn't worth spending a day or two of my life trying to convince some Korean guy that he sold me a piece of junk.  The build quality was terrible.  The only upside was that the picture was pretty good.  I still can't figure out why people recommend those other than they are (were) dirt cheap.  Now you can get a much better monitor from a reputable company for the same or less money.  If you have the money, get the XB270HU.  Get it from Amazon so if you have issues, you can return it.  Amazon previously stopped selling it due to QC issues.  They recently put it back on sale, and they are selling the May 2015 models which seem to have fixed the poor quality that people previously reported.  I'm 100% happy with my monitor, and I went in with low expectations, thinking that I would have to return it a few times to get a good one.  I'm fortunate that didn't happen."

That being said; i've heard G-sync is amazing and whether or not that's worth it to you is entirely up to you.

Mine has slight backlight bleed in one corner and one dead pixel but other than that it's perfect. Been running it at 120hz since I got it. Make sure that if you want to overclock you get the single input model.
Monitors,3dik4h,caramur,3,Thu Jul 16 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"The Qnix QX2710 and Crossover 27Q are others to consider.  Shimian makes one too.  Just get whichever is cheapest and has the interface you need (DVI / HDMI / Display Port) from a legit E-Bay dealer (green-sum and accessorieswhole have good reps--I've bought several from accessorieswhole myself).  They're all panels from batches Apple rejected for Cinema Displays, but the defects tend to be a dead pixel or two, or a little backlight bleed.  If those matter to you, shell out for a Cinema Display.  Otherwise, go Korean."
Monitors,3dik4h,lemurvomitX,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"Very true. But if you want 120hz you need to go with a single input DVI-D flavor. Also, make sure that it specifies glossy in the Ebay ad."

I know because I was in your exact position yesterday buying the same type of monitor lol. I ended up getting the XL2411Z simply because the panel on it is the same to higher end BenQ XL2430T with the main difference being the design/base, some menu options, and the 430T has a DisplayPort while the 411Z only has Dual Link DVI. I also made my choice due to the lower cost point and the fact that that I am not that hard core of a PC shooter player, thus I wanted a good value for the price I was spending. I also want to buy a new monitor down the road when I update my build (currently have a i5 4690K with a 290 and I don't think I can make full use with a free sync 1440p), so a cheaper price point was more rational for my decision.

Let's clarify here: both of the screens you linked are 2560 pixels wide.  The 32"" is 1440p and the 34"" is 1080p ultrawide.  Some key differences between these two formats:   The 32"" has more pixels (same width, more height). The 32"" is also bigger in physical size (surface area) and taller.  The 34"" is wider.  See how they compare here. The 32"" has lower pixel density: 82ppi vs. 92ppi for the 34"".  Both will be a drastic change compared to your current TV (only 46ppi assuming it's 720p). They are pretty different formats, 16:9 vs. 21:9.  Do you have a preference there?  What are you doing most?  For productivity tools, more height is greatly appreciable.  Same for browsing.  For watching movies, cinemascope movies will be glorious on an ultrawide, pano movies and series will fit the 16/9.  For games, ultrawide can be an immersive plus depending on the game.  But keep in mind that the ultrawide doesn't give you more pixels in width, it only gives you a bigger physical width, at the cost of less pixels in height.   Note that this is not about the specific models you picked, but only about the two formats."

Something seems weird here though; I notice that on the Walmart site it says tigerdirect.com is selling it for $139.99, but when I go to tigerdirect.com and search for ""seiki"" only one monitor comes up and it's a 60hz monitor. The monitor on tigerdirect is also a 24"" 1080p monitor and the pictures look exactly the same as on the Walmart site.

Monitors,3ddoh9,lwo99,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:55:55 2015 UTC,From what I understand getting decent frame rates on a 4k monitor is difficult.  You'll need a high end graphics card if you want to play the latest games at 60 fps and 4k.  Older games or watching movies shouldn't be a problem.  The main downside is that it lacks HDMI 2.0 and some newer features which will be included on upcoming 4k monitors such as freesync.    That said $400 seems like a fantastic price.  I'd go for it.  I'd buy one if I knew where to get one for $400.  Is it a public deal?

Monitors,3dfhuw,2FastHaste,2,Thu Jul 16 00:16:12 2015 UTC,Your card is compatible with G-sync.  https://gfycat.com/SameLankyEasteuropeanshepherd  which could be a nice extra depending on what frame rate you get in other games.   For CS:GO G-sync would be useless ofc.  Are they games where you get between 60 and 140 fps? Those are the ones that would benefit from G-sync.  btw the monitor you linked is an excellent monitor. One of the features it is especially good at is the blur reduction through back light strobbing.

I'm using 1440p and it's a nice step up from 1080p. But it's demanding. So that's something to keep in mind.  edit: just went though the tft central review.  http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/benq_xl2730z.htm  Seems to work fine. For only 100 dollars more.

If all else fails, scaling down to a 16:9 resolution works fine too. It's not an issue. If you've got the cheddar and the will to work around the occasional resolution issues with old / unoptimized games and UI, Ultrawide is the way to go in my opinion."

Monitors,3dcqv8,Syntra,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you will be doing primarily.   I would generally advise against 1080p Ultrawide as it just doesn't give you much pixel for productivity. For gaming however, the immersion is unparalleled in my opinion, but only when your using 34"" 21:9. That will encompass your entire field of vision.   Multimonitor is great but can be annoying as you will have to tweak and play around with settings to get games to stretch across all those monitors  If those are your option. Triple 1080p setup is a better choice, but I am bias against Ultrawide 1080p. Ultrawide 1440p is the way to go."
Monitors,3dcqv8,ossahib,3,Thu Jul 16 11:48:47 2015 UTC,"That depends on how large of a screen you are comfortable with. Ultrawides are shorter vertically because of the extra width.

Monitors,3da44j,DayBrowsing,7,Tue Jul 14 18:06:05 2015 UTC,"If you play a lot of CSGO or other shooters you might prefer a 144hz monitor over an IPS monitor (unfortunately you will have to choose one or the other; monitors that are both IPS and 144hz are extremely expensive). IPS does have better viewing angles, but how often do you look at your screen from anywhere other than directly straight on? Unless you watch a lot of movies with friends where you can't all be in the center you probably won't benefit from better viewing angles. IPS is also supposed to have better colors, but personally when I look at a TN monitor and an IPS monitor side by side I can't see any difference in colors at all; it would be a good idea to look at one in a store and see if you can notice a difference.  A 144hz monitor will make your games noticeably smoother though. Two 144hz monitors in your price range with good reviews are the Asus VG248QE and the LG 24GM77.  The main problem with a 144hz monitor would be that it might make a dual monitor setup awkward; I have no idea what happens if you have a 144hz monitor and a 60hz monitor and it might be a waste of money to get two 144hz monitors when you can only actually game on one."

Monitors,3da44j,carnetarian,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"If you want to increase your budget you could go for the the Asus mg279q. It's roughly $600, but it's 144hz, IPS, 27"" and 1440p. It's also got freesync, so if you have an AMD graphics card that's the best you can possibly do right now. It does have one drawback in that it won't go above 90hz if you have freesync on.  If you have an Nvidia graphics card you might prefer the Acer XB270HU bprz. It's $800, 27"", IPS, 144hz, 1440p, and it has Gsync. That monitor has the drawback of having lots of quality control issues; there's a good chance you'll have some dead pixels and who knows what other issues.  So you can see that the price increases a TON to get a top of the line monitor, and even then there are drawbacks. How long will those options be top of the line? I would guess that within 6 months we'll have a 144hz IPS 27"" 144hz freesync monitor where freesync works up to 144hz, though I can't say for sure. For the nvidia side, the Asus pg279q is supposed to be released in either August or September. It will be 27"", 144hz, gsync, ips, 1440p, and hopefully not have quality control issues, probably for $800.  My opinion is that you should either get one of the $250 monitors now or hold out for a few months when much better stuff is out. There have been a lot of transitions in monitor technology lately, and once stuff settles down a bit I'd bet you could get a monitor that will stay top of the line for several years. I just built a very expensive gaming machine myself, but I'm waiting to buy a new monitor because the options out there right now just aren't that great."

Monitors,3dbnge,MediocreMango,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:22:26 2015 UTC,I honestly think you won't be able to play those games at 60 fps ultra. I have a curved ultrawide with 980 SLI and even I cut it close sometimes. Keep in mind that GTAV and  Witcher 3 will have  problems.  I think your best bet is to Google benchmarks for either 3440x1440 with a 980ti or if you can't find any then just split the difference between 1440p and 2160p benchmarks to get a rough estimate.
Monitors,3dbnge,ossahib,2,Wed Jul 15 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"Ghetto method: 4k displays have more pixels to be rendered than a 2k ultrawide does, so see how the 980 ti handles 4k gaming and add a couple fps to that."

Not sure how the two approaches compare.

Monitors,3da9qs,magemagicc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"TN vs IPS (massive visual quality difference) and G-sync vs Freesync. So G-sync is proprietary and comes with a price premium. But that's all.   As for the benefit of G-sync at 80fps than having it off. If it's off, your panel will run at a fixed refresh rate. G-sync and Freesync are Variable refresh rate technologies. If it's running at a fixed, it's at... 120 or 144 or 60 or whatever options are available, then your GPU will be outputting a frame 90 times per second, while the panel is refreshing 120 times per second. Basically, that leads to a Tear. Basically, the monitor refreshes however much of the panel has been generated as it's generated. So if the GPU has only made 60% of a screen, the monitor will put up 60% of the new frame, and leave the 40% of the old frame there. It will constantly be 'torn'. It looks like this. This can be Fixed by turning on V-sync, which forces the panel to wait til a WHOLE screen has been generated before putting up a new frame, or sync the screen Vertically. Though this results in stutter while some frames may take longer to come out, and will result in significant input lag. Looks something like this. Obviously this is a slow mo example, but you can Really FEEL the delay when you play, if you've ever used V-sync before.   G-sync and Freesync are Variable Refresh rate technologies. Meaning that the refresh rate of the panel Matches the output rate of the GPU constantly. So if you're running a game a 60fps, your panel is refreshing at 60hz. If you're at 115 fps, it's at 115hz, and so on. G-sync has a full range, from 20hz-144hz, while freesync is able to support up to 240, though each panel manufacturer makes their own, it's not proprietary, so always check the variable refresh Range on any freesync monitor. In this case, that freesync monitor IS slated for 30-144hz freesync, but do check reviews to back up the validity of that statement.   That's about it. Though the difference between TN and IPS looks something like this. I'm sure you've noticed if you lean back in your chair or tilt your laptop too far back, the colors get fucked. That's TN. IPS has much better viewing angles in terms of true color, and the color replication is also much truer, making it better for video and photo editing, as well as color and videophiles who can ""tell the difference""."

Monitors,3d70ei,Teknocratz,3,Tue Jul 14 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"Were you looking to buy the freesync or gsync model?  Unless you are planning for at least a dual 980 Ti, you don't need your 3440x1440 ultrawide to be 144hz also. 75hz with g or freesync is plenty at that res.  The freesync model should hit NA this month or next, I'm not sure about the gsync but I can't imagine it'll be much later."
Monitors,3d70ei,an_angry_Moose,2,Tue Jul 14 05:30:51 2015 UTC,You can most definitely profit from more than 75 Hz at 3440x1440 without dual 980ti. It just depends on the game and settings.
Monitors,3d70ei,13_random_letters,2,Tue Jul 14 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"I actually have empirical data to prove that statement is untrue. The reality is that a 980 Ti is almost PERFECTLY tailor made to power 3440x1440 @75hz max adaptive sync (g or free doesn't matter).  Have a look @ this review of the 980 Ti, and scroll down to the 2560x1440 section.  After calculating their 1440p benchmarks, you'll find that the mean FPS is 78.39 and the median is 75.   2560x1440 is 1267200 pixels per refresh less than 3440x1440.  Ultrawide 1440p is 1.34375x bigger than 1440p, so the graphics card is expected to achieve .744x the FPS of what it achieves at 1440p.  74.4% of 78.38 fps is 58 fps, putting the 980 Ti's performance dead center of its g-sync/freesync performance on a monitor running 3440x1440  I hope that this helps.  Edit: ""It just depends on the game and settings"" isn't being fair to someone asking for advice. When we give computer/monitor/graphics advice for a rig they'll be gaming on, we have to assume they'll be playing the industry standard games, and are looking to put all relevant settings to max (sub ed: from 1440p onwards you may not need to push AA as high depending on monitor size)."
Monitors,3d70ei,an_angry_Moose,2,Tue Jul 14 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"Your conclusion is good. But for myself, the ""game and settings"" is an important factor. I'm currently hoping for 3440x1440 at 144Hz with a single 980 Ti.  Some games like CS:GO and Starcraft 2 could benefit from the 144Hz (I need to verify that aspect ratio however), for more demanding games I could run at lower fps or tone down the settings a bit.  On a different note, if I'm in the market for a new monitor, I think I'd rather not buy it considering my current graphics setup, because in the past I've upgraded the video cards much more often than the monitor."
Monitors,3d70ei,13_random_letters,2,Tue Jul 14 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Some games like CS:GO and Starcraft 2 could benefit from the 144Hz (I need to verify that aspect ratio however), for more demanding games I could run at lower fps or tone down the settings a bit.   I'm not sure if you fully follow... If your card isn't able to make 144hz because it averages around 55 fps with those settings, a 144hz monitor isn't going to make a difference, and a 75hz g-sync is going to be fully utilized.  As a side note... as far as I know, there are no 144hz 3440x1440 monitors currently, so the debate isn't really one that you need to factor into a purchase."
Monitors,3d70ei,an_angry_Moose,2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"I mean that some games would profit from 144Hz because I run them at low settings or they are a bit older (i.e. CS:GO and SC2) and some games will not profit from 144Hz because they might run at 60fps, which is fine with me.  You're right that they don't exist yet. I (and I believe OP) were thinking of waiting for them to exist instead of buying what is on the market today."
Monitors,3d70ei,13_random_letters,2,Tue Jul 14 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"Are any of them even confirmed planned?  You realize that 3440x1440@144hz is 1.43x as much data as 4k@60hz, and that a 980 ti is barely sufficient for 4k@60hz, right? In other words, you're not going to come close to 144hz.  The point I've been trying to hit hard here is that if a 75hz gsync monitor comes out and you have a 980 Ti, there is literally NO SENSE waiting for a 144hz with the same specs. You will not see a benefit."
Monitors,3d70ei,an_angry_Moose,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"I had not done this calculation before, it does put things into perspective. Then, from your point of view, I should choose 3440x1440@75Hz or 2560x1440@144Hz?  Edit: Here is a comparison  3840x2160 = 8294400 * 60Hz  = 497664000 => 1  3440x1440 = 4953600 * 144Hz = 713318400 => 1.43  3440x1440 = 4953600 * 75Hz  = 371520000 => 0.75  2560x1440 = 3686400 * 144Hz = 530841600 => 1.07"

Monitors,3d69oq,tex_porneau,2,Mon Jul 13 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not completely certain since I don't know anything about that monitor. But your symptoms lead me to believe that monitor uses PWM dimming, and you're sensitive to it. Side Effects of PWM Dimming  I recommend going through NCX's monitor questions/recommendations page here, and finding a different one. NCX really knows his stuff when it comes to monitors and only recommends PWM dimming free monitors.  Again it's just a guess but your problems sound exactly like PWM dimming issues. What brightness do you keep the monitor at? Maybe you could try setting the monitor to max brightness and see if that helps since with most monitors that apparently disables the PWM dimming since PWM is used to lower the brightness. Again I'm just guessing and throwing out ideas."
Monitors,3d69oq,spyder256,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:44 2015 UTC,Might be because of the light. I know you won't like it at the beginning but you should try f.lux. Worked wonders for me and I don't feel as fatigued when I sit in front of the screen for longer amounts of time.
Monitors,3d69oq,Scheur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said, you probably should sit further away to compensate for the low PPI of 1080p at 27"" when playing games or crank the FOV setting up higher."
Monitors,3d69oq,Pendulum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"I can't find any reviews on it, but most likely it uses a low frequency PWM. I used to have a PWM monitor, and there was a time it impacted my vision so much I couldn't even focus properly, now I'm on a laptop with a constant current backlight and I can read whole day long without any discomfort at all.   Always read reviews before buying a monitor, if you can't find any, don't even consider it.  The only thing you can do right now to alleviate fatigue is to go to menu and decrease the blue channel if the whites and grays look too cold. Also, set a brighter lighting in your room and increase monitor's luminance to a reasonable level."

Monitors,3d3h6b,BuckNastyy,4,Mon Jul 13 05:39:34 2015 UTC,"Go with a 1440p monitor if you want. My 7950 has only let me down in The Witcher 3 at that res so far. The clarity of the image at 1440p over 1080p is just great, well worth sacrificing a few settings for in more demanding games.  You could go with a 144hz 1080p monitor and gain lower input lag and relative tearing-free gaming since your fps is not hitting the refresh rate. But then you'd be stuck with a TN panel.  To answer your question, the Dell S-series are some of the only desktop monitors with a glossy coated panel on the market (unlike every Macbook and mobile device, strangely) and the S2415H is relatively new and is the replacement for the old S2340M, most noticeably featuring a slightly larger panel, slightly better overdrive implementation and no PWM. The U series are typically higher end products - the U2414H comes with a factory color calibration, and more importantly it uses an ATW polarizer which is a godsend against the black glow often found in IPS monitors"

Why is it so much cheaper than the rest of the 1440p ips panels? (Sorry for all the questions, it's taking me longer to decide on a monitor then parts for my pc)"
Monitors,3d3h6b,mokkat,2,Mon Jul 13 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"Smaller panels are always cheaper than their larger counterparts. When the 25"" 1440p monitors started arriving in january the Dell one was extremely cheap for 1440p in Europe. It was never that cheap in the US, where it seems only Acer's version reflects the cheaper panel.   I'd only exclude the Acer if you detest the casing and foot, the panel is sound enough."

You should look into the Dell Ultrasharps for monitors with stupidly small physical bezels (that the screen actually goes all the way to).

That's right, the box that I ordered was a chinese knockoff, but due to my already stated lack of research, I never knew.  Awesome.  I found this out by borrowing a converter cable from my brother(the reason I didn't just use this is because the console I'm connecting doesn't have an audio out) and connecting a Roku 2 XS with the video settings on 480p and sure enough, it worked(with some stretching a fiddling with Monitor settings).

I could use usb to hdmi adaptor for a second display but I'm not sure about max. resolution and refresh rate for that one. It would also put a lot of strain on the dedicated gpu I presume?  There is a mini display port to 2x hdmi splitter but I believe it's a hacky workaround where OS X would 'see' two displays as one.  Maybe someone knows more about how I could set them up?

The Acer goes to the full 144hz, but it doesn't use an IPS panel.   That setup would run fine. 290/290X/390/390X/GTX 970 are a good value sweetpoint for running a 1440p monitor. I'm fine with my single 7950 in most games, but I'd love a 290X for running TW3 and other graphical heavyweighters.  With minimal tweaks to game settings you should sit comfortably in the 35-90 fps range with a single 290X in all games. With the Acer or when you're playing CSGO/Dota2/other easy to run games you can just run 144hz instead."

For your particular setup the ti should be playable, deping on overclock, etc but Witcher 3 seems to be pretty well optimized - games such as Farcry 4 are terrible.

It's basically double the pixel density of a same sized 1080p monitor.  Adaptive sync: does it have g-sync or freesync? Will i benefit with my card?  Finally, always look into reviews.

I figure if I pay for the technology I should be able to use it. I read a wishy-washy article that said no but they didn't seem definite. Is there some sort of work around?
Monitors,3crasj,Cereaza,2,Fri Jul 10 03:57:34 2015 UTC,"Free sync only works with compatible AMD Cards (Free sync IS an open standard, though Nvidia only programmed their cards to work with G-sync) and G-sync is a proprietary NVIDIA technology, which will ONLY work with compatible Nvidia cards.   G-sync does cost more than freesync, though it generally works better, and supports a wider refresh rate than freesync. (G-sync will sync your monitor to your gpu down to... about 20 fps. While freesync... it depends on what the panel manufacturer wanted to do. Sometimes it's as little as 45-90fps. Anything above that has no variable refresh, anything before that doesn't have variable refresh either.)  For one more lesson. Variable Refresh Rate is the name of the technology that G-sync and Freesync work on. The refresh rate of the monitor becomes ""Variable"" and it varies to sync up with the output of the GPU.   One thing to note about G-sync, is that should your GPU's fps go Over the maximum refresh rate of the panel (in this case... 144hz) it will automatically switch into V-sync, which many people do not like. As of now, I do not believe there is a workaround for this."

Monitors,3crasj,Cereaza,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"If you're pushing 60hz on a 144hz panel at 1440p. you should set the refresh rate to 60 hz. (just because it's not variable refresh, doesn't mean you cna't intelligibly set the refresh rate to be close to what you think you'll get out of it.)  That being said... G-sync is amazing. To me, it's worth the money, but that is $200 premium on g-sync compared to non g-sync panels, all else being equal."

Monitors,3cokb1,TheTechnoWiking,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"I personally would go with Asus or BenQ.   Speaking from experience, I've owned the XL2420TE (the predecessor to the XL2420Z, which is the ""higher""end variant of the XL24211z) for about 18 months, and have had no issues with it. Build quality is superb and the panel is excellent even though it's a TN panel.  As for ASUS, I have many friends who own the VG24QE who use it for CS:GO without issues.   The difference between the two comes down to price, build quality and panel quality.  Price: The ASUS panel is about $30 cheaper on Amazon and usually cheaper in most cases than the XL2411z.  Build Quality: Both are solid, but the ASUS has a glossy stand and bezel, while the BenQ is all matte except for some glossy parts on the back (which you won't see). If glossy bezzels bother you, then the $30 extra might be justifiable.  Panel Quality: Out of the box, the BenQ seems to have been reported with better overall colors. The few times I've looked at the VG24QE, the colors seemed a bit saturated. Again, this is just from word of mouth and my own experience of viewing the monitors.  I'm obviously biased towards the BenQ, and I think the extra price is worth it.  Of course, I don't think you will regret your purchase with the ASUS panel either.

Physical defects, pixels dead or artifacts, etc. Some people like them, I don't.   And that's my opinion. Just go on PCPartPicker, narrow it to 144hz, 1ms, and select your manufacturers. Pick a few models in your price range, read reviews, make a decision."

Monitors,3cos54,Elltrain_,4,Thu Jul 9 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"They aren't interchangeable.  If you want to use the Asus's adaptive sync, you need an AMD card.  Nvidia for the xb270hu.  If you want all of these features (IPS, 144hz, 1440p, free/gsync) now, you don't have a lot of options.  Also, isn't the freesync range on the Asus monitor a bit crippled?"

Monitors,3codav,Apk07,2,Thu Jul 9 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Why do you have to choose between the two? If you're willing to risk $680 on an open-box XB270HU, why can't you A) wait until you have $100 more for a NIB one from Amazon (where you can easily return it), or B) wait a bit for the XB270HU to come down in price, or go on sale (remember that amazon aniversary thing coming up)? I know how it feels to be impatient and just want to pick something out, but don't settle for less and then wish you had something better in the end. You won't exactly be upgrading from this for a long time, so make it last.  I just got an XB270HU from amazon, and it turned out perfect. No noticable backlight bleed, and no dead pixels. It was worth it, and gsync is one of those things that you 100% take for granted after using it for a while. I have a 980 and can't get a fluid 144hz in every game so I'm happy I don't have to deal with vertical tearing. Moving back to my old 1080p @ 60hz is painful.

Monitors,3cn86h,Apk07,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"TBH squeezing 1440p into a 25"" instead of the usual 27"" will make things that don't scale well pretty damn small, but at the same time look nicer because of the higher pixels-per-inch.  Also, its not the size of the display that gives it good colors and angles, its the type of display. A TN panel (most cheap monitors you see) will have pretty bad viewing angles and not-so-great color reproduction. IPS fixes both of those problems, but adds a bit of latency to the pixel response time. PLS is kind of a middle-ground. Both monitors you linked have a 5ms response time, which is fine for IPS (4ms is the lowest)."
Monitors,3cnme8,hatred05,6,Thu Jul 9 08:34:53 2015 UTC,It's native and therefore looks better. Plain and simple. DSR can look decent though.
Monitors,3cnme8,Assanater601,3,Thu Jul 9 09:20:28 2015 UTC,VSR is squashing 1440p into 1080p so there is detail loss. 1440p native will look clearer/better but its up to you to decide if its worth it. I assume your graphics card has enough grunt to run 1440p?

Also, since VSR will render, say, a 1440p image and resize it for 1080p, there should be an fps hit.  Another of my queries would be, would that fps hit be greater than running the game on a 1440p monitor at that res?"

Monitors,3cnme8,Compizfox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming VSR is just supersampling? In that case you can look at VSR as some (pretty good but taxing) form of anti-aliasing. It renders at 1440p and then downsamples to 1080p, which is pretty much the same as SSAA/FSAA.  So of course there are disadvantages between that and a real 1440p monitor: VSR doesn't give you real 1440p. You can't, because you need a 1440p monitor to display that."

And the bezels would annoy me. I've looked for monitors with super thin bezels and your going to have a harder time finding one you want let alone getting three for a decent price.

Monitors,3ckuri,Kinaestheticsz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:02:57 2015 UTC,With a single 970 you're not going to see the benefit of an ROG Swift monitor. A 970 at 1440p with get decent frame but it won't be pushing 60+.   I'd actually go for a 1080p higher refresh rate monitor like the BenQ XL2411Z. You'll definitely see better performance in that regard at 1080p. To attain that same performance you'd need to make the jump to 980/SLI to get that kind of performance. Even thenI don't think you'd see the use of a 144hz 1440p monitor.
Monitors,3ckuri,Tre_Q,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"As a Swift owner with a GTX 780 Classy, I beg to differ. Unless you are playing extremely unoptimized AAA games, you'll easily see benefit. Especially with GSync on, it is damn near impossible to tell the difference between something like 90Hz and 144Hz because of the smoothness (no tearing, although high fluctuations in framerate can be a bit juddery just like any other monitor). Without GSync, you can easily tell the difference though.  And the Swift gives him more longevity in the future over going with a 144Hz 1080p monitor, which that resolution standard is already being phased out."

If you do the former, you can crop the footage in post. If you do the latter, your viewers will be seeing the black bars.

Monitors,3cge1y,calmconfused,2,Thu Jul 9 01:46:51 2015 UTC,"It's more about consistency than ms. Many VA monitors are listed with 4ms response time, disregarding the fact that transitions to black can run ten times slower or more.  The 144hz AHVA/IPS panel in the XB270HU and MG279Q does not reach the 1ms g2g transition, but instead deliver very consistently low ms.  Then you got horrible inverse ghosting and other such artifacting from too aggressive overdrive implementation, meaning you have to check reviews for the individual monitor to make sure you get a good match between overdrive and panel.  Lastly, the Eizo FG2421 has a stated 1ms response time, which is achieved by using the strobing Turbo mode. Without strobing it's more in line with other VA panels, although much faster in the dark transitions than the average one"

Monitors,3cge1y,Buddhacrous,3,Tue Jul 7 21:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yes you are correct, though not all monitor's refresh rates are measured equally so it can be hard to compare them from the manufacturer.  Impartial reviews are the best place to learn the real refresh rates, input lag, and response times (along with all the other important jazz) about a monitor.   What I know is this: professional gamers with millions on the line ALWAYS go TN+1ms+144mhz at whatever resolution it runs the smoothest almost without exception.  For us mere mortals IPS with 4ms is fine."

Monitors,3cge1y,2FastHaste,2,Wed Jul 8 04:18:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of 1 ms TN panels suffer from obvious overshoot. So yes, having ultra low response times comes with a price plenty of times, since some of them need to use a high value on overdrive, which is something the manufacturer doesn't tell you. Sometimes manufacturers also specify the response times at the highest overdrive value, which is kinda crappy since there will be a lot of overshoot on transitions. For 144 hz you want most of the black-gray-white transitions to remain under 6.94 ms. Anything under that comes at your own perception of blur, anything above will cause severe ghosting. But one thing is for sure, ULMB or strobing light mechanics (lightboost) reduce blur much better than anything at 1 ms will do with 144hz. So if reducing blur with little overshoot is your main concern, monitors with either of these two should be your target."

Monitors,3chfwd,Fblade,3,Tue Jul 7 22:57:15 2015 UTC,Not many games will run at 144fps+ at 5760*1080
Monitors,3chfwd,psych0tic,2,Wed Jul 8 01:44:39 2015 UTC,"Will a 1920x1080 144Hz monitor put more demand on your graphics card then a 1920x1080 75Hz monitor?   Short answer is no.    Long answer: Unlike high-rez monitors you don't have to drive more pixels on 144hz screens.  What those screens do is allow for MORE frames per second they don't DEMAND it.  So if you are getting 1FPS the screen will display it, or if you are getting 200fps a 144hz screen will display it's max which is 144fps.  The reason this is desirable is because the more frames per second, the smoother everything seems.  So the LONG answer is that UNLESS you are going to be getting 100+ FPS it is NOT worth it to get a 144mhz monitor over a standard 60hz or 75hz monitor.  How do you know how many frames you will be getting?  Well that all depends on the games, and the settings you run that game at.  Look up benchmarks with your GPU for the games you want to play, at the resolution you want to play it at and see if it's running over 75+FPS, then 144mhz will be worth it.   All that being said, I believe multi-monitor setups for gaming are a total waste and ruin immersion.  I would say it is far better to invest in a Gsync 144mhz 2k screen (the 980ti will handle it just fine) such as the Swift (TN): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236405 or Acer (IPS): http://www.scan.co.uk/products/27-acer-predator-xb270hu-2k-144hz-g-sync-ips-displayport-2560x1440-350cd-m2-100m1-4ms-speakers-usb3-  Pair either of these with a smaller second monitor and you'll be at about the same price, but with a much better in game experience."

I currently have an IPS panel (and have had multiple for years) - I am very well aware of what glow is; these panels have bleed.  I am happy to show you a comparison shot if you want, but to call that glow is absurd."
Monitors,3cj0je,Battou62,2,Wed Jul 8 13:27:08 2015 UTC,I guess I just got lucky with my monitor then. Mine appears completely dark with any kind of light in the room. All I notice is a small amount of glow in the lower right hand in a dark room with a dark background. The U2715H I had previously had much worse bleed/glow.

Monitors,3cj0je,MyNameIsNotAllan,2,Wed Jul 8 16:23:09 2015 UTC,Not sure what I would do in your case... If I was gaming and it's noticeable in a dark game then I would send it back. If it looks like yours ONLY when really having an absolute dark screen in an absolute dark room..... Then I THINK I would keep it..  Mine has arrived and I'm gonna pick it up later today.. I'm both excited and scared at the same time because all the vendors here in Sweden are sold out so if I'm not happy with this one I have to wait a month for a new one..

PC monitors default to full hdmi range and the option to switch it to limited is rarely provided. If  you feed your full hdmi range monitor with a limited signal from wiiu it will result in all kinds of picture problems like significantly reduced contrast and white crush. You want your signals to be matched.  Look at the eizo FlexScan monitors, they do offer a limited hdmi range option. EV2450 would be a reasonable choice, I guess."

Monitors,3cbgu0,pianoman148,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:39:07 2015 UTC,I found turning contrast down to 0 and refresh rate down to standard helps significantly.   I have a back and forth going with Samsung support on twitter. They have 'escalated it to the product specialist' but we will see how much that actually does anything. It has been a week since any meaningful update.   I think it has to do with the way they do white balancing in relation to the refresh rate. I found when I am playing a game with a bright background it is significantly worse. I have yet to play with my nvidia settings to see if I can find a software solution to the hardware problem.   Let me know if you find anything that seems to make the problem better.

Monitors,3cb28y,fresh_pie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think g-sync would be your best option as you don't like screen tearing, 144hz at 60fps will still tear and have motion blur.  Also even if you do not hit 144fps in games feeling that smoothness everywhere else is nice too."
Monitors,3cb28y,2FastHaste,0,Mon Jul 6 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"1) Does 144hz greatly reduce motion blur?   Yes.  It reduces eye tracking motion blur by a factor of 144/60.  Practically if you track an object moving at 1000 pixels per second, you will perceive a trail of blur 16.6 pixels long for 60fps at 60Hz but only 6.9 pixels long for 144fps at 144Hz   Is this true at 60fps?   No. at 60fps you will have the same amount of eye trackign motion blur on a 144Hz monitor than you would on a 60Hz one.     2) Does 144hz greatly reduce screen tearing and input lag?    Yes. Tear line will persist on the screen for 6.9 millisecond before moving to another position instead of 16.6 milliseconds. This makes tearing significantly less visible.  Input lag will be lower at 144Hz in both v-sync off and v-sync on scenario compared to 60Hz    Is this true at 60fps?   Yes for both     3) Is v-sync necessary at all on 144hz?   That depends on your preferences.     4) Would my situation benefit more from g-sync? Keep in mind that lower fps doesn't really bother me. Input delay and screen tearing do.   I would recommend getting both 144Hz and G-sync.  A 60Hz monitor would limit the upper bound of the VRR window to 60fps. Meaning that the GPU would fall back out of G-sync, each time you hit 60fps, which is not ideal."
Monitors,3cb28y,Lob-Star,2,Mon Jul 6 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for the great reply! I think g-sync is out of my budget though.

The Swift also suffers from pixel inversion but, worse yet, vertical banding on all monitors, which I can attest is really annoying once you start noticing it.   The xb270hu seems like an alright monitor, but it will probably soon be outshone by screens with more consistent QA at similar or better prices.  Regarding the Swift -- as a previous owner my recommendation is to stay away. Its issues are by design, so unlike the backlight bleed on the xb270hu, they are prevalent on all monitors."

Regarding the pixel inversion, that's an issue seen on both the Swift and the XB270HU because of certain shared internals.

Go to a physical store and see the difference yourself   Ultra wide 34"" fills your entire field of vision. Especially if you get a curved monitor. No need to turn when compared to dual monitor setups. Edit: go curve if you can. You will feel like the corners/edge are a bit far on a flat monitor  You will need a pretty beefy GPU to handle 3440x1440 though. A single gtx 970/ati 390 won't be able to handle it. I'd go for a 980 or 390x. Downscale if your using 970  I am currently waiting for benchmarks of the fury air cooled GPU and most likely pick up the upcoming acer 34"" freesync curved monitor.

Probably more importantly, the newegg model is the ""Multi"" version which has a built in signal conversion and hdmi input. This may seem like a good thing, but it actually can create stuttering and limit your ability to overclock. That being said, I own both monitors (I have the hdmi one so I can plug my work laptop into it) and for every day use they are hard to tell apart. For gaming, the one with the hdmi does noticeably stutter more. If you're only going to be using DVI-D anyway, then you don't want the multi.  Additionally, the one from amazon includes the ""Perfect Pixel"" guarantee. This means that if you have more than five dead pixels, you can return it for a full refund. I bought three monitors, two with perfect pixel, and one of them had a bunch of dead pixels (probably about a dozen). I didn't even notice until after I had voided the warranty though, so I can't comment on how much hassle it is to take advantage of the warranty.

I'm using an Asus PB278Q and then debezeled 2 x Acer 193w (so 2560x1440 and 1440x900 respectively...but the middle is 16:9 and the flanks are 16x10...so not exactly sorted perfectly before going into this...)  You can't span your monitors w/ Nvidia Control Panel in PLP.  So to play games, I was opening them in Window Mode and then using an application called ShiftWindow to re-position / size the display.  I managed to get it running for Assetto Corsa in like 4360x1440.  I also have a GTX970 and was hitting around 55-60 fps with no AA, high details, low mirror resolution.  Other games didn't require the ultrawide view, so didn't do much more testing than that.  In the end, I went back to full landscape mode, created some custom resolutions of like 1755x1097 on the flanks and then lined them up so they all matched horizontally.  They work better for browsing the net, general productivity, etc.  And for A/C, I run at like 6400x1440.  I miss a bit of sky and dashboard on the sides when driving, but it's fantastic for looking into corners.  My two cents..good luck with whatever you find / decide!"

From what I've read, you will probably get more advantage out of a 1440p monitor, since the 144Hz mostly benefits FPS games and the like where quick reactions are necessary.  Also, I would aim for an IPS monitor if you go for 1440p, they have better colour and viewing angles than a TN monitor (though slower response times and lower Hz), but generally reach only 60Hz (with some exceptions)."

As far as surge protectors go, I'd recommend buying a fairly nice one, with all the equipment you plan on plugging into them.   One more thing to consider.

I would choose between 144Hz 1080p TN and 60Hz 1080p IPS depending on the kind of games you play, and whether you value smoothness or colors more.  I also wouldn't recommend 1440p on monitors below 27"", as some people have issues reading small text and windows text scaling is frankly shit.  As for specific models, search for reviews on sites that provide good information (tftcentral is good, but their review selection is limited).

Eye tracking motion blur is lower and stroboscopic steps are shorter the higher the temporal resolution is. So there is probably some gain there but nothing significant.   It's all just about comfort. It feels more fluid and crisp when you move the mouse or drag windows. It won't do much when typing code though.  btw: It's nice that you are aware of 21:9 aspect ratio, Variable Refresh and 144Hz. Hopefully you will try to have maximum compatibility in the games you will design. For variable refresh rate, it's convenient if your game is able to run in exclusive full screen mode.

Monitors,3btjd7,Terakahn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:35:24 2015 UTC,"a couple things: it needs to cover more than 95-98%, ideally 100%,  of the srgb, adobe rgb, and rec 709 and DCI color spaces. most normal screens can do 100 adobe and srgb but 709 and dci is where it gets expensive, because those are for film and tv production.  it also has to have backlight uniformity at most viewing angles, and the color/brightness shouldnt change when you tilt your head or move the screen- it should be the same at all angles. IPS screens help with this. The other big thing is that it should be calibrated, either out of the factory or done by the user, and for some applications there are monitors that allow you to store LUTS/calibration profiles onto the screens internal memory."

You'll be happy with any monitor you buy because you won't have another monitor side by side with it to see the color difference, if there is any to begin with.   You want a gaming monitor, for gaming, not for colors.  Sure maybe the LG has better colors, but are they SO much better that they are 100 dollars better?  I haven't used both so I can't say for sure, but considering its a TN panel I know they can't be.

Monitors,3bs9ry,Chvrgers,2,Thu Jul 2 00:38:23 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to say, because it depends entirely on whether or not you think 144hz is worth it. Check out a computer store near you and see if they have 144hz displays to test out.  Also consider that you're mainly streaming, not really gaming too much. 144hz may be a little overkill in that case. It still feels good for non-gaming use, but you'll have to ask yourself whether or not the higher cost will be worth it.   The important thing though is to keep consistency. A 144hz monitor will make the 60hz monitors feel slow and unresponsive in comparison. If you get 3 60hz monitors, sure - you won't experience the faster refresh rate, but you won't notice it because it's not something you've ever used. So make sure whichever you get (60hz vs 144hz), buy three of the same, don't mix and match.   Sorry for the wall of text!"

If you really really want to play twitch shooters where you'll need every frame, go for a 144hz monitor.   If you're someone who just plays for fun, you might be better off with a 4k monitor with an IPS panel, as you'll have a higher resolution with better colour response.   It's ultimately up to you. I have a 4k ASUS PB279Q which I really like (though I much prefer the Ultrawide style of monitor)."

This is my basic guide:  In an ideal world you would have both.  Since you need to choose, you need to decide if twitch based games like CS:GO and Far Cry 4 are more important to you than pretty games like Skyrim.  The faster you need to be in game, the more you want a 144hz.  The slower you can be and the prettier you want it to look, the more you want 1440p.

A lot of that is wholly imperceptible to the person behind the eye, but the eye catches that data. It's not something you'd be able to pick out, but it's there.  There is a VERY night and day difference between 60hz and 120hz...

No to mention you can't really pin down variables with testing on a website. Most likely the system latency itself is not taken into account.

I personally have never had a monitor/display that goes over 60Hz (yes sad I know), but the difference between 24Hz, 30Hz, and 60Hz is absolutely bonkers.  I think there was even a study done with fighter pilots looking at video of 220 frames per second and one frame was an image and they could identify the image (a plane). That to me is pretty bonkers.  I think this is more of a question of latency vs. frame rate though. I know a few monitors have a response time of a supposed 1ms. Whether or not that's the total latency (it probably isn't) is beyond my knowledge, but I'm pretty sure 200ms is big enough to notice the difference especially to those who are trained/pro gamers.  Again, just speculation, but like you've said the eye in many cases is even more sensitive to change than the ear. I know they've had issue with the early Oculus Rift because  the latency was too great and it was jarring.  Either way, in my experience (with audio stuff) the less latency the better. I'm sure it's not too different with video/virtualization/games.  edit: as a side note ever since I've been gaming at 60 fps it makes 30 fps games look like shit, and movies/TV honestly bother me by the amount of blur. I get why studios don't switch to high frame rate, but surely they can see that it's the future."
Monitors,3br9h5,2FastHaste,2,Thu Jul 2 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, regarding your edit.  I can't bear to watch 3d movies in the theater because the shuttering effect is way too noticable and irritating. It's a neat effect, still, but I'd prefer to have smooth motion over 3d effects until the technology's sufficiently advanced.  As far as audio, 200ms of latency is very noticeable. 5ms is about the tolerable threshold for 'real-time' monitoring if you're recording. Get high enough and you start running into the Speech Jammer effect.  If you're a DJ and you have 200ms of latency it's noticeable but you can work with it. (IME lots of digital DJ systems will start underbuffering at sub-200ms forced latency anyway, so it's the lesser of evils.)  So, all in all I guess what I'm getting at is - there's applications in which latency is less critical, and there's other applications in which it's crucial to have as close to real-time 'rendering' as possible. The games I play are mostly very twitchy so display lag just increases the odds of dying miserably."
Monitors,3br9h5,Pawulon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:54:18 2015 UTC,"Agree. I haven't tried 3D gaming yet, but I'm sure it's much more pleasurable at higher frame rates.  I think what's really bizarre is that most displays and playback environments support at least 60fps. Sure the storage is x2 what 30fps is, but so far the 60fps video I've found I really enjoy. I really do think it just boils down to people are so used to 24fps that they can't enjoy higher frame rates because it doesn't look ""right"" to them.  I think VR technology will (likely) push overall system latency down, frame rates up, and hopefully it also gives a little nudge to high frame rate video as well."

Monitors,3brc4f,capndev_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'd never heard of this issue, until this week when I've had the same issue as you, during this heatwave.  So, I had one in my 21:9 ultra wide LG 29UB65-P which alerted me to the issue. I haven't seen it since.  But, my Samsung TV has about 8-9 living and dead crawling around under the screen. Here's a few things I found during research:  To prevent them: place bright lights or lamps next to the screen to attract them away/out. There's also options such as insect tape or lights to attract them away. You can also try the obvious of leaving windows shut to keep them out when using a screen (particularly when using it in the dark), but, in this ungodly heatwave, that's not an option unless you have AC. I'm now looking at getting it installed myself.   To get rid of the living: the only ways I've found to get living thunderflies out is the above example of placing a lamp next to it. Or, once noticing them, immediately turn off the screen to stop producing heat and lights, then, try shining a torch toward the edges of the screen to attract them toward it. I tried this with my TV using an iPhone and One plus One torches and, although it did seem to start attracting them to the edge, it was taking forever.   Removing the Dead: a popular solution is to try using suction cups (the kind you get on children's toys that stick to car windows etc) to stick on the panel, and gently pull apart the panels to allow the bugs to drop down. Apparently, this works well with monitors. I tried this with my TV and, I think the panels are placed differently because they didn't budge an inch.   Of course, as you stated, there is the ability to dismantle the screens and clean them, but, it's risky and usually voids a warranty. I'm going to try contacting the engineers who provide my TVs warranty to see what they suggest as solutions and preventative measures. I'm Sure they get asked a lot.   Hope this has helped."

Monitors,3bptwp,PokemanFTW,3,Wed Jul 1 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"In league monitor doesn't really matter as its a third person game. I guess 144hz would give you a small advantage. League isn't really a game push hardware in any aspect. You don't really get an advantage over a $300 pc and $100 monitor. Of course a higher resolution will look slightly better and a higher refresh will be smoother but it wont have the same effect as in high detail first person games.  I would go 1440p, 144hz freesync or gsync(depending on your GPU) for this money, maybe with IPS as well.   I don't think 4k is worth it outside of productivity (and you really need to go 40"" without scaling). Without a frame rate higher than 60fps your resolution in motion is going to be much lower than 4k. And its hard enough to get 60fps at 4k anyway in new games."

Monitors,3bjsbm,DOSBrony,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:13:44 2015 UTC,Is there a reason why you need a monitor with high refresh rate? As most monitors would be a TN panel which means that the colour representation would not be as good as IPS monitors. I would rather you get an IPS monitor like the dell U2414M.   If you really want a monitor with high refresh rate you should make sure that you would even be able to run the games you want above 60.  There is also no point having a high refresh rate monitor when your TVs will be running at 59/60 max.   I would suggest you go for a monitor that would have better colour representation than a high refresh rate TN panel as you are not a competitive player and IPS monitors with high refresh rate are expensive.
Monitors,3bjsbm,brahbruh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:35:59 2015 UTC,"dell U2414M   The monitor is 1920x1200, so it wouldn't be useful for any tri-monitor setup with 1920x1080 monitors."

Monitors,3bjsbm,DrFish96,0,Wed Jul 1 07:34:52 2015 UTC,"Well, wouldn't the TV's be larger than the actual monitor? Eyefinity with mismatched monitor sizes kinda sucks, you'll have issues with screen tearing because one monitor would be connected via dp and the TV's would be connected via hdmi. In order to eliminate those issues you'd need to connect all the panels via the same port so either all three via hdmi or via dp which won't be possible since two of them are TV's and the don't have dp in. Another problem you might encounter when setting up eyefinity is the need of an active dp to hdmi adapter since your gpu is from amd. I'm guessing you've got something like one dvi out, one hdmi out and two dp out. One monitor will have to be connected via dp and unless you have a monitor with dp, any other configurtion would need an active adaptor. This benq is nice, also this asus one and also this one if you'd like something bigger."

Monitors,3bg1h2,z-Routh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"The way I see is like this.  If you are playing a competitive FPS, or MMO or something and you're trying to get an edge, you play with a 144hz monitor and no g-sync so that you can have the maximum FPS and refresh rate (144hz) to get the quickest relay of information to your eyes and hopefully have the reaction times to match.  It's all about speed here.   If you enable G-sync you are basically slowing or speeding up the refresh rate of the monitor (up to its max obviously) to coincide with the GPU, so you don't get screen tearing.  This is for people who aren't playing a competitive game, but a very visually stimulating game like Tomb Raider (or insert game of choice here).

Monitors,3bg1h2,Pksayshey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:06:07 2015 UTC,I do not understand your example. G-sync goes to 144 hertz unless a specific monitor does not. Free sync though does not go up to 144 hertz. I play cs go and have g sync on so there is no screen tearing or stuttering and i have 144 fps. I have the acer xb270hu.

Monitors,3bdy5r,Steeps5,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"I would like to suggest the BenQ XL2730Z. Matches the features you want for $599.  One point I would like to make between this and the Acer XG270HU are colors. The Acer colors will simply not look as good because the Acer uses 6-bit + FRC while the BenQ has true 8-bit color.  http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/content/6bit_8bit.htm  You will be heavily disappointed in the color performance of the Acer XG270HU and it will likely look washed out (I've always had problems with Acer colors).  The Acer also has NO options for mounting to a bracket and you cannot adjust the stand.  I have the BenQ XL2730Z and it is fantastic: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824014451&cm_re=xl2730z-_-24-014-451-_-Product  If you feel that $600 is too much, you could possibly wait for a sale, but that could be a while.  Here is my review of it though:  Pros: - 27"" at 1440p is awesome! - 144hz is great, if I could run games at 144hz :( - Blur Reduction (but only at 120 and 144hz) - TRUE 8-bit TN panel produces the best colors I've seen on a monitor - AMA (Advanced Motion Accelerator) settings reduce/eliminate ghosting - FreeSync (have not been able to use) - High quality build, very sturdy stand - VESA mount - No backlight bleed or IPS glow (obviously) - No problems with QC, got a perfect display - Headphone hook - USB 3.0 - Better than average viewing angles for TN - Great contrast thanks to the 8-bit panel  Cons: - Out of box color calibration was terrible - Blur Reduction settings are missing some features in the current firmware, hopefully will be updated soon - No Lightboost - I have heard that FreeSync cannot be used with overdrive so it ""might"" cause some ghosting  Other Thoughts: This monitor was a huge upgrade for me. I came from a basic Acer 23"" 1080p 60hz monitor that was very washed out and only had 6-bit color. I cannot tell you how amazing everything looks on this new monitor. I don't even care about the other features all that much, I really just wanted a 1440p monitor with decent response and 8-bit color.  I'm hoping that I can make better use of the blur reduction features when new firmware is released to fix some settings.  I should add that the Black eQualizer is kind of a gimmick, but maybe some competitive gamers like it. All it does is reduce black levels and makes them brighter. It is turned on by default, and that is why the colors look terrible."

I play pretty much any game ever   On average, what do you think would be better for gaming, high refresh rates or a larger resolution? Usually this question is easily answered based on what games you play, but for the vast majority of games, I would chose a higher resolution.  With adaptive sync and high refresh rates, it's impossible to know how much you value them until you see them in person, most of the time, so being able to check out some monitors at a shop should help you make a decision.

That's a common misconception. 50fps + VRR will be choppier than 60fps @ 60Hz V-sync (If there is no drop in framerate)  Note that G-sync monitors are superior to freesync monitors at the moment. (Dynamic overdrive, No lower bound on the VRR window, support for windowed applications)  See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkrJU5d2RfA  Also note that G-sync now supports V-sync off above the VRR window which was not the case at the time the video was made."

It is simply making it in sync like v-sync does with many advantages over v-sync such as no v-sync induced micro stutters if the frame rate drops and no buffering meaning less latency.  What that means is that if you are looking at 60fps@60Hz V-sync content without drop, it will look EXACTLY as smooth as 60fps stable capped under G-sync. And what I said applies to any static framerate.  G-sync 50fps feels like 50fps@50Hz v-synced for example.  It's as simple as that."

It is wider, because it is aimed at video professionals working with actual 4K footage (4096px wide) and using the DCI color space instead of sRGB or REC 709.  The reason I got the BenQ was because this was still $1250 or $1300 and the BenQ was $1000.   I work mainly in sRGB color space so the BenQ was all I needed.

I am currently dealing with a similar dilemma -- really want to get a new rig/monitor but not sure whether I want to get the Acer XB270HU or wait for the aforementioned 4k monitor by Asus. I've never experienced 144hz and really like high pixel density, but people keep saying that 144hz should not be overlooked.  I'd kill for a 4k 144hz monitor but that seems to be at least a year off. It's supported by Displayport 1.3 (which is out now) but video cards aren't supporting the format yet."

Monitors,3bdfy6,hovvthegodschill,3,Sun Jun 28 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"Best thing you can do is see these monitors in action. Second best is try to see an individual feature in person. See what ultrawide gaming is like, check out different size monitors to see if you really want 1440 or if a certain size 1080 works for you.  See high framerate gaming to see if you value that over resolution. That's what I did, by going to Frys, Best Buy, local LAN parties, and watching countless YouTube vids. I eventually found that, for the games I like, ultrawide was really appealing and I needed IPS over TN. Resolution was fine at 1080 if I stayed at 29"" ultrawide (24"" equivalent). I also needed freesync to get rid of stutter, but didnt require 144hz refresh rates. I'm very happy with my purchase, but it doesn't mean you would like my monitor the best.

I have a 980GTX and don't currenty plan on upgrading to SLI anytime soon. Does anyone have experience running a 1440p monitor with a single card? There are several other LG options at 1440p ultra right now but I am not sure if a single card would run a resolution that high and remain stable.  The difficulty is that the monitor I bought has zero black light bleed and no dead pixels. It also does look really nice in games like GTA V and Tomb Raider, but leaves something to be desired when reading Reddit.  Any thoughts?

Maybe if you got a TV with displayport, but there aren't many, I know panasonic made a few models, but they're pretty big for a monitor (50 inch+) and pretty expensive too. I sold my three monitors and got a 40 inch curved 4k tv from samsung and I'm loving every second spent in front of it, for me, it was the best choice, but I have two gtx970's, so I get 4k@60Hz and 4:4:4 chroma subsampling. It sucks cause you're stuck with nvidia if you want hdmi 2.0, the amd cards are disappointing that they don't sport any hdmi 2.0 out, not even the fury. And no, there isn't any dp to hmdi 2.0 adapter either, if you're wondering. Best option you have for a 4k TV is the philips bdm4065 uc, which is a monitor and has a dp connector. The only things is, if you live in the US, you won;t be able do buy it directly because they never launched it there. Only Europe and Asia. You could order one, but you'd pay a lot of money bringing it from Asia or Europe."

As for the graphics cards, HDMI 2.0 won't really help me because I already ran 1.4 cables.  So unless HDMI 2.0 source allows more bandwidth over 1.4 cables than 1.4 source I'm stuck there too.      I noticed they sell cables that go from 1 dp to 2 HDMI but none in the other direction.    So as I suspected it looks like I'm limited to 1440p.  Even 21:9 @1440 looks to be too much bandwidth."
Monitors,3bazxq,DrFish96,2,Sat Jun 27 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"The cables are fine, hdmi 2.0 works with normal 1.4 cables, the only thing they tweaked is the connector itself. Any 1.4 cable should work just fine as long as it's shorter than 10 feet, some people were complaining that cheapo cables longer than ten feet lost signal over the length and didn't support 4k at 60 Hz,  but shorter ones from the same manufacturer did. I'm suspecting that you have longer cables since they're in the walls, I can't vouch for them if they're going to work or not, you'd have to try them by yourself somehow, but you'd need to have an nvidia 900 series GPU to start with."

Most games should run well enough on a 4k display, but you'd have to sacrifice visual settings on some. And TV wise, your best options right now are samsung's 2015 4k TV lineup have a read about them here. I know the post is long but it's full of useful information about them. Another alternative to the samsung TV's is the lg 49ub8500, but it's not as good as the samsungs (color wise, input lag wise, build quality wise). But if you decide to buy a 4k TV, make sure it supports full 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, besides the 60 Hz. Most TV's that support 4k@60Hz don't suport full color at 4:4:4 and it's a deal breaker. As you can see, there aren't many options available right now and making everything work is quite the hassle, but once you've got it right, there's no other thing compared to it, simply put, you get the best experience a desktop can offer, without being overwhelming, without having the annoying bezel between multiple monitors and without the screen being too big that your neck starts to hurt by looking at it."

Monitors,3bakhy,tylerismisfit,2,Sat Jun 27 10:31:07 2015 UTC,I use the Asus VS239HV (or VS239H-P in the States) and it's a 1080p 60Hz IPS (much better colours) display that I can't recommend enough.  Mine was only £115 including VAT so that should easily equate to under $200 over there.
Monitors,3bakhy,BlearyLine7,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:14:14 2015 UTC,Just bought a BenQ GW2760HS 27-inch VA panel.  Seems pretty nice so far.
Monitors,3baa8r,Ownsin,5,Sat Jun 27 07:32:24 2015 UTC,27 inch is the sweet spot for that resolution monitor imo.
Monitors,3baa8r,Assanater601,5,Sat Jun 27 07:42:44 2015 UTC,"I went from 27"" 2560x1440 to 25"" 2560x1440 and I love it. The size difference is not something you notice after a day or two. What I love most is the fact that I can't see the pixels from my sitting position, which was a problem with the 27"" version. IMO no scaling is needed either."
Monitors,3baa8r,LunaNosCustodit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on text sizes of your 25"" vs 27""? Are you able to do long periods of reading on your screen without issues?   I am looking at 1440p monitors for larger screen estate when coding, and I've been pondering the 25"" vs 27"" question myself. I'll be going from a 21.5"" 1080p monitor which has pretty low PPI, and I don't know if it affects the display/scaling of large amounts of text if the density goes up."
Monitors,3baa8r,rollhr,3,Sat Jun 27 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"The only program that I've had to scale up is Chrome. That is 110% at 27"" and 125% at 25"". If I actually did some coding, I'd probably also scale Notepad++ by the same amount but for reading misc files and jutting notes from time to time, normal scaling works fine. I don't scale Windows at all.  My guess would be that you'll utilize some scaling with either size. The jump in screen real estate will still be considerable (~78%). Either option will be a nice upgrade from 1920x1080."
Monitors,3baa8r,LunaNosCustodit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"I'm currently looking into buying a 25-inch 1440p one. I find 1080p to be a bit low over 22 inches, and the higher resolution just makes text look better and easier to read."
Monitors,3baa8r,andreipoe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"Well you won't need scaling for either option so its all down to personal preference. I have a 25"" 1440p monitor and I love it. For me 27"" is too big for a single screen but I do have a relatively-narrow desk so I do sit close to the screen.

As someone mentioned above, even if you do decide you want to use scaling (which I doubt you will) there is still an increase in screen real estate from 1080p so its still just a matter of preference and / or desk space..."

Monitors,3b8jez,njb0401,2,Fri Jun 26 20:55:40 2015 UTC,I'd even trust a brand name like Acer before QNIX.  QNIX is basically made with reject panels that don't pass QC for the 'big' manufacturers.
Monitors,3b8jez,rabidbasher,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"It comes down to your risk tolerance. I assume you're buying the QNIX off Ebay and shipped from Korea? If so, the risk is it comes DOA or has more dead pixels then you can tolerate, then you will need to pay for the return shipping for them to refund or exchange which could cost you quite a bit depending on where you live. In addition, read the sellers perfect pixel policy. Generally, 0-2 dead pixels are considered acceptable for perfect pixel. However, this shouldn't be a big factor as 1-2 dead pixels in a 1440p monitor isn't noticeable unless its like dead in the middle.  I personally went for a 27"" 1440p Korean Monitor similar to the QNIX 2710 and love it."

Ultrasharp on the other hand are the higher quality versions which sometimes come pre-calibrated. If colour accuracy is your primary concern then you need to check reviews but Ultrasharps will be of more interest to you.

Monitors,3b2ib6,dieselasfuck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered 1080p has a good pixel density for a 24"" screen. Once you bump up to 27"" 1080p still looks fine but the pixels per inch becomes less. You want 1440p at 27"" to keep the ppi high. So to answer. A 1440 screen will be 27 inches,  and 1080 will look less crisp than it would on a 24"" (1080) screen. Someone correct me if I'm wrong."

Monitors,3b2ib6,hovvthegodschill,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:41:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, received the monitor yesterday, I haven't had a ton of time to test it out, but I will give you my experience so far.    I can't comment on the quality of the stand because the first thing I did was swap it out for a VESA HP one I had, that wasn't too difficult but it does require opening the housing for the monitor to remove the stalk of the old one, which is nerve wracking on a brand new electronic.    Once that was completed, I hooked it all up and immediately attempted an overclock of 110hz by simply adjusting the refresh rate under the nVidia control panel.  I almost immediately saw some visual artifacting.  I did this more to test if it was capable as I was planning on running the display at 96hz either way.  If I messed with the timings a bit I would likely be able to get it stable at 110hz, but this was never my goal and I'd rather not waste the time trying.  At 96hz it is completely stable and I have no frame skipping.  The next thing I did was check for dead or stuck pixels and back light bleed.  The korean monitor gods must be shining on me because this monitor is damn near perfect; not a single dead pixel nor excessive or obstructive blb.  I was concerned about the matte screen as I had read that matte screens dull color, however due to limited space, this monitor is sitting directly across from a window so a glossy screen was out of the question.  My concerns seem unfounded.  While I'm certainly no expert, to my untrained eye the colors are superb.  The matte finish is very light and has in no way detracted from my limited experience with the monitor.  As for gaming and framerates, I have so far only been able to test Crysis 2. I put all the settings on Ultra and ran it at full resolution.  I was getting an average of about 50fps dipping as low as 30fps and going as high as 65fps.  I am running a 2GB EVGA 960 GTX so your experience here will likely be a bit better.  My ONLY complaint, and it is incredibly minor, is that the glossy monitor bezels reflect the light from the window across the room and can be a distraction during low light scenes in movies and games.  This could be fixed quite easily by applying some gaffer's tape to the bezel or more ideally by placing the monitor in a different location.  I wholeheartedly recommend this monitor.  For the price, you would be hard pressed to beat it.  Let me know if you have any more questions."

Frame rates are the number of frames your GPU can put together and send to your monitor PER SECOND (edited)  Refresh rate is how often your monitor will take to refresh the entire screen.  So if your GPU can push out 72 frames and you monitor is refreshing at 144hz the monitor will refresh and display each frame twice.  If your GPU can push 60 fps, and your monitor refresh at 60hz each frame will be refreshed and displayed once"
Monitors,3b2pe9,skasucks478,2,Thu Jun 25 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, your wording for frame rates.   Your GPU does not really put frames together and then push them them to your monitor. It is how many frames, a single image (1 frame), is sent to your screen.  While true that refresh rate and frame rate (fps) are not entirely linked, you start ""losing"" frames above 60fps on a 60hz monitor. This is where screen tearing can come into play. A reason V-sync is an option. It caps your frames to your refresh rate.   Having a higher refresh rate helps when you are consistently going above 60fps, since you will no longer be ""losing"" some of those frames and you will theoretically be able to see every frame up until 144fps.  Anyone please correct me if I made a mistake trying to explain this."

TN's can get to higher refreshrates cheaper than IPS, but IPS looks nicer / has better viewing angles.   The majority of monitors do not overclock, there are a few like the catleaps/ QNIX that can. Look at the reviews, if no one talks about overclock, probably can't overlock. Other research in the monitor will help.  You will mind ~10ms latency i fyou play games."

Monitors,3b2vll,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:03:39 2015 UTC,I'm confused why someone with a 3007 would think a $400 monitor was overkill but anyway.  What about the LG 34UM97? It's got thunderbolt inputs. It's pretty much the only monitor I'm aware of that has them. It will be similarly large and high-resolution as your Dell. And it will look fancy.
Monitors,3b2fvi,JOLLHURN,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:46:44 2015 UTC,"Not yet, I wish there were some available."
Monitors,3b04sw,rotorain,8,Wed Jun 24 22:13:26 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Current monitor names are a bunch of bullshit letters and numbers nobody wants to read.  If I started a monitor company I would try to have recognizable names. Like a different animal name for each size, and then a simple clarification on which submodel it is.  Something like:  Sloth = 24"" TN 1080p 60Hz  Sloth G = 24"" TN 1080p Gsync 144Hz  Sloth F = 24"" TN 1080p Freesync 144Hz"
Monitors,3b04sw,phalange33,2,Wed Jun 24 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Animals are would be great. Kinda like the architecture names for CPUs and graphics cards, then they could give a string that actually tells you info about the monitor.   Maybe size-resolution-refresh then panel type, for example a 32"" 1440p 120 Hz ips panel would be the jaguar 32-1440-120 ips. The animal would tell you the monitor series and the string would tell you the general specs. I doubt a monitor manufacturer would make two panels in the same series with the same specs but change other things about it so the name would still be unique."
Monitors,3b04sw,BionicSammich,5,Thu Jun 25 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is, that Asus now has two new ROG Swifts. A 4k 60Hz IPS and 1440p 144Hz IPS model, so they need to come up with some kind of logical system. That said, PG278Q for 1440p TN, PG279Q for 1440 IPS and PG27AQ for 4K IPS is a terrible naming scheme."
Monitors,3b04sw,804R,2,Thu Jun 25 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, there's definitely a better way to differentiate them. They could just call them the ROG SWIFT 1440 and the ROG SWIFT 4k. Then the names actually mean something other than being a different assortment of letters and numbers"
Monitors,3b04sw,804R,2,Thu Jun 25 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"The names aren't bad, you just have to understand them. If you look at the names you can usually get a decent idea about what the monitor is and its specifications. I'm going to make one up now: The Samsung SM32U60. That would be a 32 inch SyncMaster with a 4K resolution and a 60 hz refresh rate.   On the other side, you have things like the ROG Swift: this tells me nothing and I wouldn't know the specifications without looking it up. This monitor is made for people who don't want to bother with knowing what they're getting, but want to get something that sounds and looks cool and are willing to pay a premium for it.   All in all, it's just about finding the logic. I didn't understand AMD's name standard after having used nothing but Nvidia for years (I mean, R9 395x2, WTF?), but it didn't take long to get into."
Monitors,3b04sw,RAIDguy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:43:08 2015 UTC,"Some monitors have a naming convention that makes sense, but it's hard to distinguish between the strings that mean something and those that don't. I wouldn't be comfortable inferring information about any monitor from the string alone without a standardized naming convention.   At least with graphics cards they have a naming convention. There's only 2 main manufacturers, and with AMD there's R9 which tells you the series, and then the next number is the model (higher is better)  and the x is a special version. With Nvidia the first digit is the series, the next two are the model (higher is better) and the ti is for the special version. There's two naming conventions, and anyone can figure out that the bigger number means a better card.   If only monitors had a simple convention like GPUs. Even a bigger number is better system would be nice, but if the string actually gave monitor specs in a standardized format I'd be so happy."

A 1080p monitor makes 1080p look better than a 1440p monitor, but if you're running a game at 1600x900, neither really has an advantage."
Monitors,3b13h7,kkjdroid,2,Thu Jun 25 08:19:51 2015 UTC,"Just think of it like this  1080p will mean every single pixel has a predestined position to be in, so the pixels will never 'move' on a 1080 screen (cause blockiness).   If you play 1080 on a 1440, there are an extra 360 vertical pixels and an extra 640 horizontal pixels for your 1920x1080 pixels to (move).   FYI: I am playing The Witcher 3 @ 1080 on my 1600 monitor, because I prefer a slightly lower resolution over lower fps or lesser postprocessing.  Of course, blockiness is emphasised by screen size, so the bigger your screen is, the more obvious these 'moving' pixels will be.   1080 will look more accurate, but 1440 gives you flexibility."

Monitors,3b13h7,james_bonged,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"It will look the same but because of the higher DPI on 1440 the closer you sit/the larger the screen, the more obvious the blockiness will be.

Monitors,3b13h7,atfsix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:14:23 2015 UTC,Just get a 1080p screen. Native 1080p looks better than 1080p upscaled to 1440p.
Monitors,3b13h7,Bingoose,2,Thu Jun 25 13:54:26 2015 UTC,"1080p on a 1440p monitor looks worse than on a 1080p monitor, the monitor itself will also be more expensive. That said, 720p looks better on a 1440p monitor than a 1080p monitor so it will really depend on the game.  This is due to scaling. 1080p on a 1080p monitor is obviously 1:1 but on a 1440p monitor scaling is involved, which can never be perfect. This degrades the image. If you wanted to splash out on a 4k monitor, that is exactly 4 times the resolution of 1080p and would look exactly the same as on a 1080p monitor.  My recommendation would be to get a 1080p 60Hz IPS monitor, as that will get the best possible display from your Xbox One. Aim for a response time of 5ms or less to reduce input lag if that bothers you."

I currently use IPS and can handle IPS glow, these were yellow bleeds from the four corners of the monitor, with the top left and bottom right being the worse culprits.  I also used the ICC profile, and set up the monitor per TFT Central which lowered brightness; so it's not like I was running it at stock or full brightness - it was still unacceptable bleed.

It was always related to monitor timings, specifically the Vertical Total setting. Just increasing/decreasing it one or two units made a big difference.  But I think custom resolutions don't work with G-Sync (you can try just in case). In some cases the problem solved itself when I switched refresh rates or turned off and on the monitor."
Monitors,3ayrn6,arrogant_elk,16,Wed Jun 24 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"Resolution.  Get something that your system can reliably push 60fps to in most cases.  Most monitors are in 16:9 aspect ratios, like 1920x1080 (1080p) or 2560x1440 (1440p), but some people like ""Ultrawide"" monitors in 21:9 ratios. Response time.  Faster is better, but manufacturers often list gray-to-gray values which tend to not represent actual performance.  Check reviews for good info, like on tftcentral. Generally, less than 16ms is fine for gaming if you aren't playing competitive, fast-paced games at a high level. Panel technology. Most commonly, IPS vs PLS vs TN vs VA, all have ups and downs.  Most are TN or IPS.  TN has better response time and is cheaper, IPS has much better looking colors and viewing angles.  PLS is like a faster version of IPS, and VA is known for very deep blacks Refresh rate.  98% of monitors are 60Hz.  Other common refresh rates are 96Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz.  Higher refresh rate makes all motion smoother and may reduce eye strain in some people.  If being used for gaming, higher refresh rate allows higher fps to be displayed by the monitor, but this requires extra graphics power.  Also check to see if certain inputs must be used for high refresh rates on the monitor you're considering.  Adapters can also cause problems with high-refresh rate monitors, so try to avoid them when possible. Extras.  VESA mount capabilities, input selections, on-screen displays, built in speakers (usually the shittiest speakers ever), USB hubs, stand adjustments, blur reduction (Lightboost/ULMB), G-SYNC or Freesync, etc.   Generally all of this boils down to a few categories.  Cheapest is 60Hz TN monitors.  Next is 60Hz IPS monitors.  Then 144Hz 1080P TN, then 1440p TN and IPS.  There are a select few 1440p 144Hz monitors in both TN and IPS currently available, but for quite high prices"

Monitors,3azki8,alexsama,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:52:50 2015 UTC,you'd also lose ULMB   Are you sure about that? I'm pretty sure that's a GPU agnostic feature.
Monitors,3azki8,Ra1d3n,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Searching around the internet, I've only seen people with AMD GPUs that can't enable ULMB, and no one that could. I'm pretty sure it's locked to Nvidia only.  Besides, OP's problem is different. The Freesync version of the monitor he wants doesn't have G-Sync or ULMB (they come with the G-Sync scaler). That's why I said that he would lose those two features if he bought the Freesync version."

I'd recommend you go into a store and look at both models (or at least a 27"" monitor and compare it to the Ultrawide) and see which one you'd prefer for the type of things you're planning to do on it.

Monitors,3ax8i0,Abui1016,2,Wed Jun 24 06:01:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does. This is because it has higher pixel density, meaning more pixels exist in a same-sized area.  You've probably heard these terms being used related to phone screens. Most high-end smartphones today have screens with density over 300 DPI, which means most people aren't able to see the pixels when holding the phone at a normal distance from the eyes."
Monitors,3ax8i0,andreipoe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:56:20 2015 UTC,I read from some people saying things are too small on a high res small monitor. I don't understand how since I have a retina display MacBook and everything seems like a good size. Is it true that it's small or...?
Monitors,3ax8i0,andreipoe,2,Wed Jun 24 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"Most windows apps are badly written in the sense that they don't scale well to different screen sizes. This happens because componeents like the window frame, buttons, text fields and so on have fixed sizes, which are usually designed for regular 720p or 1080p screen. Now, if you use a higher resolution screen, you'll effectively have more pixels, so applications will appear smaller. Here's a quick example: if an application window is 500 pixels tall, it would take up about half of a 1080p screen, vertically speaking, but the screen is 1440p, then the window would only take up about a third.  I persoanlly don't think 1440p is too high for 25 inches, but that obviously depends on how you like to see things on your screen. That being said, Windows has some scaling options, but they usually only stretch application windows, which might make them look blurry.  The reason this issue doesn't happen on Mac OS is because they use a different scaling technique and apps are probably better optimised to take advantage of it. Keep in mind that Retina Macs have been around for a while now, but high-density screens are still not so common on Windows machines."
Monitors,3ax8i0,andreipoe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:15:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, thanks a ton for the help! I think I'll hold off on a 1440p for now until things become better optimized on windows. Is it possible to cheat this on a 1080p monitor in games by upping the scaling of the resolution to like 125%?"

Monitors,3av1ao,Yolo_Swagginson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure what is the word. What I want is to simulate a bigger resolution somehow, to fit more things on screen, like zooming out."
Monitors,3av1ao,Skunkman76,3,Tue Jun 23 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"Try changing the Htz to 59, one of the resolution I was trying I had to do that. Have your tryed a guide yet?  If you can read the text when you switch to 1440p and its just a little blurry then its probable working right. Thats just the way it is when you downsample. If its Windows you want more space on, you can turn up the dpi in windows to make the text more ledge able.  For games it will not always give you more space(some games it might, menus and such will be smaller) and no way to make the text more ledge able. Down sampling is really for anti-aliasing  Two ways to turn on down sampling in the nvida control panel: through custom resolutions under Change resolution and Manage 3D settings as DSR Factors on the Global tab. There are check boxes for 1.2x, 1.5x and so on."

I set it up with 25% of blur, less than that the text gets very ugly. But it's less blurry also, better to look at. I guess if I get a bigger display, 27"" 1080p and do the same thing, it would be better, right?  Maybe on OS X it could work better?  Thanks."
Monitors,3av1ao,purplesmurf_1510_,2,Wed Jun 24 01:47:58 2015 UTC,Ok that makes sense. I haven't seen a way of doing that though. Windows has scaling settings but they're only for the opposite - making things bigger for high res screens.

Out of the two, I'd go for the ASUS IPS. It looks great. I think they'll both be great for gaming. The faster pixel time on TN panels can make the display better for faster pace games like racing and also can be better for 'high accuracy' games such as CounterStrike. IPS looks nicer generally so it might provide you with a nicer experience on other games.   Pretty much, they will both be great. Weigh up the features you care about and make a decision.

Zero tear, zero stutter, its amazing. It makes the game feel new. I have yet to try BF4 or other graphical intensive games. The lower freesync range of 35fps IMO is great, I dipped below 40fps in survarium a couple times and couldnt tell! If I recall correctly if you are using freesync on any other monitor and it dips below 40fps it turns freesync off automatically and stays off until you exit the game and re-enter and lower graphics so it doesnt go below the 40fps threshold. If you are planning on getting a new GPU then maybe a monitor with a higher freesync threshold would be for you, but as it stands the MG279Q would be great for you. I just want crossfire to work with freesync so I can scoop another one up while everyone is selling their r9 290x's for Fury X's haha.

Monitors,3asg0r,Chansonian,7,Tue Jun 23 03:31:50 2015 UTC,"First off, FreeSync comes at low added cost, while G-Sync adds a premium. It just happens that there are very few of them out there, so both companies have been working to get adaptive refresh rate tech on monitors that have other specs which increase price. For example, I have the LG 29UM67, which is the same price as the non-freesync variant. It's the Ultrawide + IPS + quality build that make it more expensive.  Soon enough, you should see cheaper monitors with FreeSync added, as it gains popularity.  On the other hand, adding a G-Sync module to a $200 monitor effectively doubles the price, which makes much less sense in that price range.  As to whether it's worth it, it's entirely personal taste, so I can't tell you.  What I can say is that stutter and screan tear are really annoying to me, so I chose to eliminate both as a priority when building my PC. Playing games without stutter is an amazing experience that's surprisingly hard to describe. If you can find a way to see the demo in person, do it. Otherwise, you just have to decide if stutter is annoying enough to you that you go out of your way to buy one of these amazing monitors :)."
Monitors,3asg0r,Trues17,2,Tue Jun 23 05:17:04 2015 UTC,"Probably a silly question but I haven't found a concrete answer yet. Does freesync work for nvidia cards? I know gsync is exclusive to nvidia, just not too familiar with freesync."
Monitors,3asg0r,Acebandit92,2,Wed Jun 24 00:31:07 2015 UTC,"No, freesync is enabled through AMD's ""catalyst"" graphics driver and only works with a select few of their cards, but most likely includes their entire new lineup.  The ""open"" and ""free"" comes from the fact that you can technically use freesync on any monitor with displayport 1.2a connection, whereas g-sync relies on an additional module to be installed in the monitor."
Monitors,3asg0r,Trues17,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:04:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarification and reply. Like I said, had been struggling to find a definitive answer, but was also probably looking in the wrong places. Cheers!"
Monitors,3asg0r,Acebandit92,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"all those gpus are already dp 1.2a adaptive sync compatible, so you really won't miss freesync if you get a true dp 1.2a panel (which typically are also freesync).  g-sync is far superior but comes at a gpu+panel premium over $400, so it would then depend on your budget and visual acuity."
Monitors,3asg0r,stonecats,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:11:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother with the r9 390x. It's overpriced and is bound to drop dramatically in price.

It'll just slow you down from your end goal. That's money that could be used towards your new monitor/GPU.  Have you considered crossfiring your 280? That would probably be sufficient for a 3440x1440 setup."
Monitors,3asmli,VZ_Tinman,2,Thu Jun 25 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"1 - There are SOME games that will give you issues with ultrawide. However most games do support it without a problem. For many of those that don't, they will work in 2560 x 1440 perfect and will just put black bars on the sides. There are is also software to fix a lot of games that don't support it. I would say not to worry too much about gaming compatibility as it's only going to get better for 21:9 on the future.  2 - I considered long and hard about getting an LG 34UM95 after seeing it in person. It was an amazing monitor to lol at and game on. It also comes in curved form (34UM97). If you want to wait a bit longer there acer will release the Acer XR341CK and it looks great.  For now, my impatience and love of 144Hz won over and I instead got the Acer XB270HU.  Which is simply awesome, but not ultrawide."

I believe that we should  be seeing the beginnings of what you want by the end of 2017.; I don't think it will be ""perfect"" until near 2019 though. Even then it will be expensive for another couple years. once it gets cheap, expect something new to come out and make you put off upgrading again.  That is really quick in terms of development but I could never wait that long for an upgrade. I caved and upgraded 2 weeks ago.  TL;DR Give up and upgrade. Expect your new tech to look and feel old within 2 months of purchase."

I see no reason to go beyond 4K at a monitor screen size, 144Hz is good enough and my GPUs will have a tough time reaching even that. Moore's Law can only go so far, going beyond this only makes things harder to drive. I am pretty confident that with that setup I would be satisfied for quite some time, mainly cause my body will simply not perceive improvements after a certain point.  In any case, you provided some good perspective, and I think I'm just gonna upgrade already (and again, when the time comes). Any recommendations based on what I described above? Also, out of curiosity, what did you buy?"
Monitors,3apsr7,VZ_Tinman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"I went ahead and got an Acer XB270HU. Expensive for sure, but I wanted 144Hz, 1440p and ips. And that's the only way to do it till later this year.  Depending if you want g sync or freesync.You could go with the Asus mg279q, it's fresh out of the factory and at 600 bucks a pretty good deal for free sync. If you want g sync, the Acer I talked about above is the way to go, but it's 800 dollars."
Monitors,3ap4v7,ghfujianbin,4,Mon Jun 22 10:41:48 2015 UTC,It's not an IPS problem. Your monitor has a 6bit panel and what you see is the FRC dithering that means that to compensate for the lack of color depth the panel constantly switches and mixes colors in darker areas to simulate finer shades.  The more expensive 1440p IPS monitors are true 8bit panels that don't use dithering.
Monitors,3ap4v7,Polar_Snow_Fox,2,Mon Jun 22 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"So in other words, it's common for monitors that's 6 bit?"
Monitors,3ap4v7,Polar_Snow_Fox,2,Mon Jun 22 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. Some might have it better, some worse. All cheap 1080p ips monitors are 6bit+frc."

So the reason why I'm not seeing this problem on my cheap laptop's panel (TN, 768p) is that it's not even trying to produce an accurate color by using the dithering method?

Monitors,3apljb,DrBroFist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"Acer has a few monitors that could be within reach for that budget. A used xb280hk is only around 500USD and it's an amazing monitor. The problem with 4k at the moment lies in driving it. A 980 will work decent at 4k for today's games. But the games next year or the year after and you will likely need an upgrade to keep a good 60 fps.  I have tried 4k and 2k. And while 4k is really awesome, I prefer the 144Hz experience. Even when not playing fast paced shooters. The smooth experience is just great.  Now that you have my personal opinion, check this site out. Some of the items stretch your budget a bit.

The best part I find about an ultrawide is the games that ARE actually optimized for 2560x1080, games like BF4, Pillars of Eternity, The Witcher 3. It's also worth mentioning that the monitor goes up to 75hz and is IPS.   Overall, I believe this monitor great depending on how much you pay.

I just don't agree with people listing monitors they think look nice and are 1080 p and say hey what one should I buy I think they all look nice. If people put in the effort im more than willing to put my effort into helping them find a quality product. I'm not painting everyone with the same brush here just these posts seem to be in a lot higher of volume as of recently

I came from a shitty 1080p TV that always had swimming pixels, but I will say, with G-Sync, I've not seen a tear yet. It's quite comparable to my OLED TV, so I would go G-Sync if you can afford it. 144hz is also very noticeable, especially on CSGO.

Will you humour me and do a test I have yet to see a single Swift pass? It's the following:  Set a nice and detailed desktop wallpaper, and run this site in a window. Click next a few times and see if your wallpaper is destroyed by the pattern.   Here's what the test looked like on mine. That poor Falcon.  Btw, is any of the test screens green? It's not supposed to be. Does the black rectangle leave a shadow at its sides across the screen (like on my photo above)? Not supposed to happen either."

I reckon the perceived resolution loss happens more or less all the time, the severity depending on what's currently being displayed -- the previously linked patterns being the worst case scenario.  I started seeing stuff akin to the video linked above in everything from Battlefield 4 to GTA V to Far Cry 4 to The Witcher 3. Forests and trees with their green colours and fine detail seem to be a particular weak spot, especially in movement. Telltale signs of the issue are thin vertical columns of darker pixels obscuring what's behind them for split-second intervals.  It's what eventually drove me to sell the monitor.

But after hearing widespread user reports about IPS glow issues, I decided it was a bad idea to pay through the nose again just to play the panel lottery.   I feel like these new cream of the crop gaming monitors are rushed in order to be first and cash in on us early adopters, resulting in QA inferior to products far below their price range. Hell, Acer is actually sending out previously returned (opened, dusty, scratched) XB270HUs to new customers, hoping to find less discernible homes for them.

The colors are great and games look amazing. I've been playing The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Elite:Dangerous on this monitor and they're all just beautiful. The base feels sturdy and has a good range of adjustable height. Haven't noticed any quality control issues. The one ""drawback"" is that the whites can be really bright...there are a couple of times in the Witcher game that the screen goes all white between scenes and it literally lights up the room.   Unfortunately, it looks like the price has gone up since I bought mine. It was $360 on Amazon and is now sitting at $400.

Decent panel overall, but only worth it if you reeaaally want a high refresh rate IPS and don't want to dish out double that for the Acer.

Monitors,3ahhj8,NickShooter25,3,Sat Jun 20 05:44:11 2015 UTC,"Here's the short answer: You can't.   Here's the long answer: I, too, have an LG TV that has a 120 Hz refresh rate. A lot of people will claim that TVs that advertise themselves as 120Hz aren't really, but it actually depends on the model. Since you didn't specify your model, I can't say, but a lot of TVs do actually have 120 Hz panels inside of them.   Now here's where it gets tricky: Even though the panel itself is 120Hz, there's no way to feed a 120Hz source into it. HDMI 1.4 only carries a 60Hz 1080p signal. In theory, even if your TV had a DisplayPort or HDMI 2.0 connection (and some do) there are no consumer components that deliver content in that format (If your GPU has HDMI 2.0, and your TV has HDMI 2.0, you could possibly, in theory, establish a 120Hz connection). But as far as Blu Ray Players, game consoles, etc. nothing will be able to output a 120Hz signal."

I also think it looks better than the Acer stand, and it doesn't really feel plastic-y at all. In fact, the bottom edge of the stand almost feels like the edge of an aluminum Macbook Pro.

It only affects clarity with fast moving objects, like in action movies or video games. For movies you'll need interpolation however.    MVA or IPS would be the best but there is no 1440p 27"" monitor for MVA so sadly it's IPS or TN and it's lower image quality.    As far as brands go, stay away from from HP and their partnership with the terrible brand starting with a b, Asus is for gamers, not exactly what you're looking for, BenQ is fine but I don't remember if they do any IPS, Dell and LG are pretty good.    While G-Sync is pretty nice if you don't play a lot of fast paced shooters it won't be worth the price.

Monitors,3aatle,cherrycreampie,4,Thu Jun 18 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"The more expensive BenQ has G-sync, which is an added chipset that smooths out framerate, but it's a newer technology so it costs a pretty penny. A quick google suggests the cheaper one, while lacking Gsync, may have better options for color calibration and blur reduction. Beyond this, monitors are going to vary on quality of panel they use and a number of features not listed here, such as customization of panel settings, stand type, etc.   PS. please explain to me what are the factors to consider when buying a monitor.   First off is your main use. Is it primarily for work? Play? Equal parts of both? This determines if you should prioritize image quality of something like an IPS or PLS panel over the responsiveness of a TN. That said, not all TN panels have bad image quality (calibration can go a long way), and not all IPS panels are too slow for gaming.  Also weigh what are your must-have features. You currently can't get, say, a 144hz 4k ultrawide IPS G/Freesync monitor, you have to choose which of those features call out to you the most. If you lean towards the productivity side of things, 4k and ultrawide resolutions are probably a better investment. If you play a lot of FPSes, racing games, or other media with fast motion, and you've got a GPU that can handle 120+ FPS at 1080p or 1440p, then you might go the 144hz Gsync/Freesync route instead.  Consider also the limitations of your GPU. Does the monitor have the ports you need? Will you need an adapter? If you want to use multiple displays down the road, will getting this monitor cause a connectivity issue?  The stand. Does the stand have height, pivot, tilt, swivel adjustments? Do I care if it doesn't? Is it compatible with my desk/aftermarket monitor stand? Is it wobbly as shit or does it have a stable base?  Is the interface of the monitor a pain in the ass? Will I be able to change the colors the way I want, or is this basically a glorified TV with all the good settings locked out?"

Monitors,3aatle,SumoSizeIt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"I've got the 2411Z which is basically an older version minus the little control pad, and it's more than sufficient for a title like that. Out of the box the colors are horrible, but if you download a calibrated color profile, the colors aren't that much worse than an IPS panel to the naked eye, and all that's really noticeable are the viewing angles (an issue any TN panel has).  Are you fully decided on wanting 144hz then? Cause for the money you could also go the 4k/60hz route if you preferred detail level to FPS. All personal preference, though, just making sure you know your options.  I can't comment on G/Free-sync, but everyone on /r/gamingpc makes it sound like the bees knees. Personally I thought going from 60 to 144hz was a huge leap, so I have a hard time qualifying how it can get any better without having seen it, especially given the premium for that feature right now in its early stages. I bring it up just because that monitor doesn't have it, CSGO probably won't benefit from it, but other games might.  The BenQ is solid, but I'd just as well recommend any competing, well-reviewed, comparable product from Asus, Acer, etc. The reason I went for BenQ over the [at the time] slightly cheaper Asus was me being a snob for fully adjustable monitor stands.  So yeah, it's a great monitor, slightly overkill because that isn't a terribly taxing game, but not a purchase you'd regret for it. Just make sure that your GPU is up to snuff should you try a more taxing game, because that 144hz won't do you much good in a game like, say, BF4, if you can't keep your FPS over 120 when the action heats up. If that's something you're concerned about, and you plan to keep this monitor for a solid 6 or so years, consider waiting and saving up to afford Gsync or Freesync."

Might come down as Freesync becomes more common. Companies like Asus and AOC have a linear progression in prices vs. features. Benq on the other hand sells the budget minded XL2411Z as well as the more expensive XL2420Z and XL2430T, all of which use the same technologies and only really differ in questionable 'gaming' options and extra Blur Reduction options on the 30T."

Monitors,3acbe2,msdrahcir,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:26:49 2015 UTC,"TN doesn't have good colors or good contrast (oftenly more around 750-850:1) while IPS have good colors and average contrast (850-1150:1). And then you've got MVA with decent colors and excellent contrast (2500-4000:1).    How much one tech is worth is up to you and what you do with it.    Play CSGO, Reflex or NT all day ? Get an IPS with 144Hz except if you can't stand ghosting then go for a TN. Multimedia, lot of reading, surfing the web, etc ? MVA have you covered. Professional or serious amateur working with photo, video or any visual work ? Get a high end IPS + MVA."
Monitors,3aa2g1,tomtank73,3,Thu Jun 18 12:39:21 2015 UTC,"Your monitor probably has a longer lifespan than your GPU, so if you're planning on buying a AMD GPU in the future I would just go for it."
Monitors,3aa2g1,Compizfox,3,Thu Jun 18 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"I have been in the market for a new monitor and have been thinking about this exact thing.  For me freesync is not a feature I am looking, but given its low additional cost, it is not a feature I am avoiding, like GSYNC.        My current monitor is an 05 model, its made it ten years and despite some minor burn in appears ready to go for another 10 so I am planning for the long term. I drew up a set of things I was looking for for a true 'upgrade' over my current monitor. 27inch, 1440p resolution, IPS, flicker free, VESA mount,  and I really wanted greater than 60hz refresh rate.     I also currently have an Nvidia card, and in all likelyhood I will continue to buy Nvidia, but when I began my searching I immediately wrote off GSync as something I was going to avoid as far too limiting, I have to have at least 2 inputs, and the extra 150-200$ premium turned me right off.     At this point it looks like Ill be getting the Asus MG279Q, which checks all my boxes, 27"", IPS, 1440p, 144hz, multiple inputs, and a pretty good warranty.  Everything else is a bonus, and I could take it or leave it; the speakers, the crosshair overlay, and yes, Freesync, all come in in the 'extra, or bonus' category, a nice extra that maybe ill take advantage of in the future, maybe I wont.     I definitely wish Nivida had thrown in with the Display Port standard adaptive sync, but at this time they definitely have the better 'sync' technology. I expect the differences to even out over time and itll be harder for nvidia to avoid conforming to the 'standard' so maybe Nvidia comes around, or maybe I buy a AMD video card (I suspect the chances are ill buy AMD before NVIDIA relents though)"
Monitors,3aa2g1,McMurry,2,Thu Jun 18 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"McMurry, this is exactly the same conclusion I have come to and will be getting the ASUS MG279Q.  Thanks for everyones input :-)"

Monitors,3aa2g1,techno_babble_,3,Thu Jun 18 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"Depending on price, OP could also switch to R9 2/390(X) for freesync support."
Monitors,3aa2g1,KingPromethus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:06:33 2015 UTC,True but if he could afford a new GPU that money could just be put towards the difference in a Gsync and Freesync monitor and stick with his 970 too.

Monitors,3a7yxr,BionicSammich,2,Wed Jun 17 23:45:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for your recommendation. My main concern with the 144Hz is that I will not be able to notice the increased frame rate and that I would be able to notice the extra clarity on the 4K monitor. I have a 120Hz TV and it did look funny when I first got it but now it just looks normal. I am thinking about running down to a store and try to see if I can tell the difference between the two monitors.
Monitors,3a7yxr,Fimconte,8,Wed Jun 17 23:58:04 2015 UTC,You will notice 144Hz. It's mind-blowing in fast-paced shooters.    I can barely use 60Hz monitors for gaming whenever I visit my friends.

Monitors,3a7xze,PsychicKitten,2,Wed Jun 17 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"I recommend Dell U3415W, if you don't plan to calibrate this is calibrated by DELL and looks great. Bulky Display, I would say the other are just as bulky. Surprisingly decent speakers, looks good, great stand. There is definitely BLB but better than LGs from what I've seen. DELLs housing I think minimizes the BLB more than LG. I think you're going to want to go IPS if you want color accuracy. I forget I'm in front of a curved monitor so I don't notice the distortion, if I do it's minimal. Also when you're looking at the monitor, it's directly in front, I don't pay too much to viewing angles. I don't hav a problem with ghosting on mine. Also 3 year warranty for DELL while everyone else is only 1 yearp. Samsung was my runner up, but it'd probably be wise to check them out in person since they're nearby. Check out these reviews"

I think there were two occasions where I may have caught my self wondering if lines were straight or not. didn't really investigate much further, but to be honest I think they look fine, but some people perceive things differently and are more keen to smaller details. I primarily code and play video. games. I don't know how Amazon is in Canada, but if it's the same as in US, I suggest purchasing on their because they have a great return warranty. I believe the person behind the reviews also is from Canada and recommends the same strategy.

Monitors,3a69y8,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:22:23 2015 UTC,LG is working on 1080p ultrawide freesync so I'm betting the 1440p isn't too far behind.
Monitors,3a69y8,slai47,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"When you say not far behind, the LG isn't going to market until the fall so we are talking a good year or so..."
Monitors,3a69y8,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"I would say faster than that, but you never know."
Monitors,3a69y8,SummitTechEnterprise,2,Wed Jun 17 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"I think the quality control problems Asus and Acer have been having with these IPS panels has slowed down the release of some of the planned ultrawides.  I'm still holding out hope for a ""holy grail"" 1440 ultrawide IPS that can do 144hz."
Monitors,3a6hzr,le_velocirapetor,3,Wed Jun 17 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"So if you use older Windows applications, I doubt Windows 10 will fix the scaling issues.  I have been looking at the P2715Q and it looks like a pretty good monitor.  I would personally go with that and then buy a second one as the prices drop.  FYI, there is a 30% off coupon for the Dell Outlet right now and the P2715Q goes in and out of stock.  If you can grab one there the price would be around $350 depending on tax.  The UP2414Q is in the outlet and the price would be ~$400 before tax.  Good luck!"
Monitors,3a6hzr,Silencer87,2,Wed Jun 17 20:18:56 2015 UTC,I have been looking at the Dell U2415's for a while now and really like them but where are you finding them for $240 each?   Also I would say 2 monitors would be better for you simply because if you are mainly using them for programming then you probably want more screen real estate rather than pixel density.
Monitors,3a6hzr,StitchRokcs,3,Thu Jun 18 03:23:31 2015 UTC,Newegg has them right now for 240. That makes sense about the pixel density. I just don't wanna be in a situation where I feel like I have older technology this time next year(or 4-5 years) when 4k is the new standard
Monitors,3a6hzr,lioemases,2,Thu Jun 18 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind refurbished, amazon is pricematching newegg so their used units are selling for around 220"
Monitors,3a6hzr,StitchRokcs,2,Thu Jun 18 05:50:06 2015 UTC,"I'm having the same issue as you. I want new monitors but also want them to be future proof. I was also looking at the Dell U2515H 1440p monitor which is half way between 1080p and 4k. Unfortunately the price isn't quite low enough where I can get two.   4k monitors are pretty awesome and the P2715Q has gotten great reviews and has a great price, however I won't be (at least in the next 2-3 years) consuming or creating media that is 4k quality. Also you can't dual screen these in the future unless you want your frequency to drop to 30Hz. (This specific monitor doesn't have support for HDMI 2.0 or DP 1.3) Personally I still think it'll be a minimum of 5 years before 4k is common let alone standard.   1440p monitors seem like the perfect middle ground, you get an ahead of the curve display that will definitely still be relevant in 5 years and still has that ""retina"" look, but without shrinking your UI down to microscopic levels. The price is still a bit high for me personally to buy two of these but dual 1440p monitors would be pretty awesome.   The two 1080p monitors are a great price for a high quality panel but like you say in 5 years 1080p will more than likely not be the max resolution you can get in the majority of video games or videos."
Monitors,3a6w5l,BlackjackDuck,2,Wed Jun 17 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, use the native HDMI port + 2x DVI-D>HDMI cables or 2x cheap passive DVI-D->HDMI adapters and HDMI cables"
Monitors,3a6w5l,mokkat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:11:39 2015 UTC,"Am I losing any performance by using converters? The monitor is only 1080p and 60Hz, so I wouldn't think so, but I just want to be sure."
Monitors,3a6w5l,mokkat,2,Wed Jun 17 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"Not at all. You're basically just reshaping the output plug with a passive converter.  DVI and HDMI are compatible like that. It isn't as easy if you wanted to convert to Displayport, but that's another topic."
Monitors,3a6ck8,DFOin90s,2,Wed Jun 17 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"with the fast evolution of 4K and VR Headsets you'll probably want something different in 3 years, so skip the warranty, your Acer should hold up fine unless you crush it during transport in which case any warranty provider will just laugh at you."
Monitors,3a6ah3,Acompooperguy,0,Wed Jun 17 15:48:39 2015 UTC,That lies on so many variables. Its like asking how much is it going to be to fix my car if and when it breaks? There is a ton of things that could go wrong than can vary in price. Could be cheap and quick to fix could be a harder task and take a while to fix
Monitors,3a6ah3,TheRealMcCoy95,0,Wed Jun 17 21:28:20 2015 UTC,do not buy an extended warranty if you are changing in use countries. acer's included manufacturer warranty should extend to both countries.  how many more times are you going to ask the same question? https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/3a6ck8/monitor_repair_vs_warranty/
Monitors,3a6ah3,stonecats,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:07:59 2015 UTC,"The double post was an accident, because when you submit a text post on an account less than 2 days old, it automatically gets removed. I submitted a second one on this account once I remembered the password, but later they also approved this post (this being the original post).   I called and asked Newegg, Acer, and AIG (extended warranty place). Newegg told me to call Acer and AIG, giving me their numbers. Acer's and AIG's warranties both do not extend past the country they're bought in, unfortunately. Unless I got the wrong answers from all of them."

Monitors,3a6nqv,Roboloutre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"Well I did get $90 back for a dead pixel that I managed to fix. For $190, was it worth picking up this monitor or should I try to sell it and get a higher quality 1440p display?"
Monitors,3a6nqv,Roboloutre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"If you want better color and contrast you're obviously better off selling your monitor. You could have gotten a BenQ GW2250 for 120 dollars, 22"" 1080p, with decent colors and a great 3000:1 contrast ratio. If you want 27"" and 1440p however your only option is an IPS panel and those have a huge selection compared to poor MVA."
Monitors,3a6nqv,Roboloutre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:27:54 2015 UTC,Hi I know this thread was from a while ago but I was wondering if renting a colorimeter would help with the color accuracy issue?
