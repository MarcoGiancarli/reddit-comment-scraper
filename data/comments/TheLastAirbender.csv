I actually have no clue what I'm going to use this for, but I'm thinking of making it a optional download for my LOK Source Filmmaker project in the future.  And again, I apologize to those who thought I was being passive aggressive with the title last time. So this time it's just straight up business now.  Just leave a yay or nay and be on your way. :)"

TheLastAirbender,3e0pux,Satans__Secretary,5,Tue Jul 21 01:43:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I liked the mech because they spent ages building up her 'secret super weapon' and then it just seemed to be a cannon on rails, which seemed like it would be the worst super weapon ever, since they could cut the line/just turn it/drop on it/whatever.  So when the mech came out, and Kuvira's long term plan came together, from all those ore mines etc she took, it was a bit of a relief, because the super weapon didn't suck.  Then it was almost too good. An avatar state korra should have been able to down it no problem, dropping it right through the ground or washing it out to sea like Aang did with the fires in his final episode or anything."
TheLastAirbender,3e0pux,AnOnlineHandle,5,Tue Jul 21 12:40:14 2015 UTC,"Well, the mech was built with the parts of Zaofu she took. Other than that there wasn't much explanation.  I wasn't a big fan of the mech myself."

TheLastAirbender,3e0pux,Cuofeng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the big reveal was a odd tonal moment for me. The mechs in the mist and then the Giant foot was a ""oh, shit."" moment. But then when they panned back and showed just how preposterous it was I laughed. Of course then Kuvira obliterated those two border guards, so it was a bit of an emotional rollercoster. But mostly ridiculous."
TheLastAirbender,3e1h3k,Jay-Marvel,5,Tue Jul 21 05:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of working on and off on a total conversion for Civ 5 to bring the world of ATLA and LOK into a strategy setting, so what I'm doing doesn't really apply here.  But anyway, I've always wanted to make a simple free-roam Avatar game on Unity or Unreal Engine 4 that focuses on the 2nd Avatar after Wan. As for Legend of Korra and ATLA, I think the best way to handle the combat is to have Korra or Aang be able to switch bending styles on the fly and have their basic bending attacks be either sweeps, projectiles, precision, or epic level bending techniques.  One idea I've always wanted to try and do is a game about being a metalbender cop swinging around and fighting crime.  I think the Dynasty Warriors would be a weird fit for Legend of Korra and Avatar, personally. The games kind of throw tactics and strategy out of the window because of all of the room-clearing and group-destroying attacks and abilities most characters have. And mowing down thousands of enemies would be kind of weird."
TheLastAirbender,3e1h3k,flipdark95,2,Tue Jul 21 07:24:56 2015 UTC,Only if the swinging is like it was in the Spider-Man 2 video game.
TheLastAirbender,3e1h3k,TheMellowestyellow,3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah totally. Although to be honest, I preferred the swinging in Web of Shadows.  I was actually thinking of basing the swinging for metalbender police off of that Unity Attack on Titan game."

TheLastAirbender,3e1h3k,Seph1rothVII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"I agree on the mowing down thousands of enemies since it's not something that happens often in the series outside of avatar state.  But there's some strategy in the Dynasty Warriors series imo, and it really gives the feel of a huge battle or war. There's huge battlefields and tons of smaller battles happening that make you choose between your objective, making sure yours bases and comrades don't fall, or looking for optional items during a level. It could convey events like the Day of Black Sun or the Equalist Revolution very well."

TheLastAirbender,3e1h3k,The_Unknown_Dude,2,Tue Jul 21 07:29:03 2015 UTC,"To properly convey the whole ""spanning both series"" feel, it could have  the same ""Memories"" mechanic as the Assassin's Creed series. As the Avatar, one can talk to his/her former lives, what if this included actual sequences as Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, Wan and the list goes on. All of them having a link or impact on what is currently going on in the main timeline, and just setting the pieces together."
TheLastAirbender,3e1h3k,r33535puff5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"I was thinking something similar to that. But it would be different members of the Order of the White Lotus throughout time witnessing or causing certain events to unfold. Maybe we see Sozin wiping out the (majority of the) dragons, or some other event that happens with an avatar we don't know of yet."

TheLastAirbender,3dyfud,Mr_Olivar,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"Long story explained very short.  Chyio is a cool mod and everyone's friend. Turn's out Chyio used mod powers to give one Nation (her nation) and extremely unfair advantage. Admins thought Chyio broke one rule and removed her from mod team, she didn't break that rule. Admins found out about the actuall illegal stuff she did before re-adding her as mod and decide that can't be done now. Because of the way she was removed everyone freaked out and hated the admins, especially the ones in her nation. One member of her nation made a post defending her, then another member of her nations admited what she did, then more people admited it. Now the person who made the first post admit he lied."

TheLastAirbender,3dyfud,Tryndameereeeeee,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"Of course not, everyone liked her, but it was her illegal support of NE during warfare, like the command blocks and the chests that fills with fire daggers when placed, that made this a big deal."
TheLastAirbender,3dyfud,Tryndameereeeeee,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"Right... We're of course ignoring the coutless other decisions the admins have made against newempire...

TheLastAirbender,3dyfud,SNCommand,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"First war, you guys randomly instituted a rule that a faction cannot keep land gained by war, and you took away all the claims we have in Suidao/NaSingSe.

NO COMMUNICATION.   I don't recall anything like this happening. Do you know what moderator or admin did this? I always consult the leader of a town before I unclaim their chunks, even if they were won during warfare.   Korra becomes the Mayor of Guo, it was his. He does what he wants with it, admins take it away. NO COMMUNICATION   This was communicated to both Krra, Dresdek and GreatUniter afaik.   Once again, Izumi gets Care, he joins NE. Admins decide they don't like that, take it away. NO COMMUNICATION.   Izumi and Morris both agreed on giving the town back to Morris, because their agreement was broken.  In every single action I take I always incorporate both parties in the discussion and communicate thouroughfully until an agreement has met.    In neither one of these scenarios was NE in the wrong, the admins just did what they wanted, no communication about the rules. If you want you can say you don't understand the lack of communication and I'll phrase it differently again.   It's not what we ""wanted"". It's what we thought was right at that specific time and after discussing about it, we figured out it was only making things worse after these two cases."
TheLastAirbender,3dyfud,Typist_Sakina,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"Oh so thaaaaaaaaaaaats what this is about. I thought Chyio was cool too, but to be honest I don't feel bad for her in the least or hate the admins for it. She knew the rules, and she decided to be cheaty. There's a consequence for every action and she faced hers.   To quote Mr. Willy Wonka, she broke the rules so she gets NOTHING. She loses. Good day, Chiyo!"
TheLastAirbender,3dyfud,Mr_Olivar,11,Tue Jul 21 10:49:27 2015 UTC,"I think we should keep in mind that there's always two sides, Chiyo helped people on the server take shortcuts, world edit for buildings people had built with passion in towns that went dead, money for her own nation which she had saved since the economy was introduced   But on the other hand they also removed the mod which had more time on the server than any other person, and the outcome was pure chaos, new people stuck in spawn for hours  I just hope people can let the drama die down for now, or at least contain it in more private quarters"

TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,Ensomnlac,22,Mon Jul 20 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"First off, it's not a TL DR if it's as long as the full post :P  Second, I believe the existence of multiple turtles has to do with just multiple turtles of the same element. And the placement of the turtles probably has to do with where the 4 nations built their settlements.   Like I don't think there's a Lightening turtle. Like in our world, Fire was probably discovered when lightening struck a tree. It's a very raw origin form of fire bending."
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,Animedingo,0,Mon Jul 20 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"Opps, well I guess that TLDR was even TL than the original post. I will fix it. As well I don't understand what you're argument is saying. Not that I disagree but I don't understand, maybe can you expand."
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,Animedingo,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Ok maybe I didn't understand your post intially cause your point was very clear.   If you're saying there are more turtles for advanced elements like sand or lightening, that's not how it works.   If you're saying there are more turtles for elements beyond the 4 we know, say anything on the periodic table, then that seems unlikely as well because there would be more prominent benders of that element.   Air, Water, Earth and Fire are what make up the world. If there are more advanced, or subset elements, they're covered by the 4 base elements"

TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,Animedingo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:15 2015 UTC,"What about them?  Not sure why im being downvoted, I dont understand what the question is"
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,sheikheddy,0,Mon Jul 20 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"Bro, the thing is that the four elements you named do not cover everything. Platinum, for instance. Animals can be bloodbent, but it's extremely painful and a crude way of doing things, like using a jackhammer for surgery. Living things in particular cannot be classified neatly into the elements you named, but science disproved that element theory centuries ago."
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,Animedingo,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:46 2015 UTC,"Im not basing it off the real world, im basing it off the avatar world.   Yes platinum is not bendable but that doesnt mean theres a turtle than can grant the ability to bend it."
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,Ignis_ex,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"I think they're just saying that multiple lion turtles doesn't mean that there are more elements. It just means that there are multiple lion turtles of the same element. Like there could be four of each of the four elements or more perhaps. So the fact that there are more lion turtles doesn't mean that there are any more elements.   Plus we saw the story of Wan, which shows him and Raava journey to meet the lion turtles and gain power over all the elements. If there were more turtles with different elements, I'm sure we'd have seen them and Wan would have gotten those powers.   As for energy bending, this is what lion turtles do. It's their ability. It's how they gave people their bending abilities, as shown in Wan's episode. The lion turtle taught it to Aang. I don't think that's considered a new element. Just something the avatar and the lion turtles can do. But that part is iffy. We don't know too much about energy bending, but I don't believe that this is proof of any more elements out there."
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,EggheadDash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:14 2015 UTC,"That is what I am saying. All the Lion Turtles are benders of energy, but excell at different things Earth Ice Air, etc. I am not suggesting that Sand is an entirely different element, but perhaps another Lion Turtle excels more at Sand than say Metal which would eventually lead to people of Sand Lion Turtle to excell with sand than others, allowing the cycle of Evolution to take place but as in bending."
TheLastAirbender,3dyos0,huanthewolfhound,4,Mon Jul 20 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Energy is basically the original element, but benders can only channel it in specific ways. The Avatar, however, is capable of bending it directly. Any other lion turtles out there would either be devoid of an element or simply be a repeat of one that already exists. The Lion Turtle that Aang found didn't give him the ability to bend energy, it just taught him how to do it, basically playing the same role that the Dragons, Badgermoles, etc. did for the other elements."

TheLastAirbender,3dy6rc,btpipe16,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:04 2015 UTC,What do you mean by pretty useless? It's by far the fastest way to travel. You have to airblast while riding to go really fast.
TheLastAirbender,3dy6rc,crod541,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"I only remember having to airblast once to get in the air, then just point in the direction I want to go. I never got the bison but just asking around people told me it wasn't an upgrade to gliding so I never bothered with it."
TheLastAirbender,3dy6rc,btpipe16,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"Using a bison you can go much much faster than gliding, trust me. I really suggest any airbender to buy one if you haven't."
TheLastAirbender,3dy6rc,nightcreation,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"Flying on a Bison using Airblast is much more efficient than having to constantly launch yourself up in the air to glide because with gliding you don't stay at the same level, you slowly glide downwards toward the ground, where you have to relaunch yourself."

Every bending type has an exclusive ride able pet and all we airbender get is a lame lemur that nobody even has.   Simple, during the series it has been shown that any other bender has ridden a Sky Bison. Zuko, Katara, even Korra has ridden a Bison on her own. Even the Sages at the shores Korra washed up onto during the middle of B2 in LOK (after the Wan Story), we saw that Bison were being raised and used all around the world pretty much.  Edit: Elbow Leeches were actually waterbender exclusive for a long while on accident, I made them available for all elements again. :P"
TheLastAirbender,3dy6rc,nightcreation,3,Mon Jul 20 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"That doesn't explain why the other animals are bender exclusive though. I'm sure an airbender is plenty capable of riding a polar bear dog. Hell, nonbenders have ridden badgermoles in the series."

TheLastAirbender,3duku5,ToTheNintieth,24,Sun Jul 19 20:30:45 2015 UTC,Why? You don't like old people?
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,N0sc0p3dscrublord,6,Sun Jul 19 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"She seemed there more for fanservice (the non-sexual kind) than anything, especially given her prevalence in the season over characters that needed it more. What's more, she was basically the exact same person she was in ATLA -- no growth or change whatsoever, unlike other characters. This includes the traits that led her to be quite a shitty mother, and she never showed regret or doubt over it. I know LOK had a theme of the Gaang all being flawed, human people, but this took it a bit too far."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,ToTheNintieth,15,Mon Jul 20 02:17:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I actually loved that she was the same. Katara very barely felt like the Katara we knew in ATLA, same with Zuko -- just brief little snippets where you could see their younger self, but most of the time you wouldn't know it was the same character (aside from obvious physical similarities). And that's fine, they both demonstrated character development throughout ATLA that would be indicative of future personal change.  Toph, however, was pretty solid in her identity. She had insecurities and weaknesses, sure, she had a softer side, but ultimately she was the most cemented (heh) in understanding herself. And I loved that she was able to remain true to herself even as an old woman. Also, I disagree that she never showed regret over being a bad mother -- I think she did that very well (very well for Toph, anyways). I would have been severely disappointed if she was only recognizable because of her blindness and saying ""Twinkle-Toes""; especially if they had given her some mini-arc where she profusely apologizes to Su/Lin and they have a huge reconciliation... I'm sorry, but that's just not Toph. People don't always change like that. She had her reconciliation with Su many years ago (they mentioned it) and even showed signs of it with Lin in her last episode, but she remained very true to her nature and I loved that."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,Jwalla83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"really? it seems to me that a lot of people drastically change over the course of their lifetime - for someone like toph who went through all that, i'm honestly disappointed she didn't change in the slightest. i accepted the fact that katara and zuko changed and in zuko's case, mellowed out so much, and thought it was a pretty nice overall conclusion to their story."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,srslybr0,3,Mon Jul 20 14:21:30 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure she changed and then regressed back in her old age.
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,Pandafy,3,Mon Jul 20 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at least in TLA she showed she wished she could have valuable family relationships, like during the conartist episode where she sent a letter to her parents, you would have thought that wish would evolve in to character growth and make her value her future family relationships more. Nope, she just doubled down on being all about herself."

TheLastAirbender,3duku5,CamaroM,25,Sun Jul 19 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"Still the queen.  Working on backlogged requests: Aang and Toph building statues.  While I am unsure if either Aang or Toph built their respective memorial statues (Toph probably did tho), I think in the duration of their friendship they’d have gotten into contests with each other, not so much to compete but to learn from one another. And because they’re bros.  Edit: omg I am so tired of reading LOL S2PID TOPH IS BLIND. People, she can “see” through vibrations, remember? And as for knowing her own appearance, blind people can “see” faces they touch, meaning Toph probably has an idea what she looks like, at the very least where her eyes, nose, and mouth go. If she can sandbend Ba Sing Se as a kid, she’s more than capable of building statues as an adult. And that’s that."

TheLastAirbender,3duku5,mojave955,28,Sun Jul 19 20:02:37 2015 UTC,I think she can only see general shape of the person with seismic sense. I remember Toph saying she can't return the compliment to Katara (about how pretty Toph is) because she doesn't know how Katara looks like
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,whiteflagwaiver,23,Sun Jul 19 20:12:08 2015 UTC,I'm sure she's lived long enough to be able to map her own face.
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,misplaced_my_pants,10,Sun Jul 19 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"Well, for all she knows, Katara could have flesh-eating bacteria on her face.   There's more to aesthetics than shape."

TheLastAirbender,3duku5,like4ril,2,Sun Jul 19 23:55:02 2015 UTC,"But most of the face is muscle and bone. She could at least get the shape of his skull if not his face muscle structure, no?"
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,MystyrNile,6,Mon Jul 20 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. In conclusion, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,like4ril,2,Mon Jul 20 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"Lol, that's probably the best possible response."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,MystyrNile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:49:12 2015 UTC,"Also it just occurred to me that if she can't quite make out the surface of the skin, her sculptures of people would look really unsettling, even if they seem accurate to her."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,like4ril,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:52:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think the statues would be terrible in that respect. The skin is pretty smooth unless you're looking really close or have a very fine-grained distinction, so her bias would probably be to leave out skin abnormalities and un-smoothness.   The worst would be people's lips which are basically all soft flesh. Assuming she can't properly discern stuff that soft (which she may have overcome through developing her sandbending), she would make statues with everything in the face being decent but they have no lips. That'd be groddy X("
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,megloface,15,Mon Jul 20 05:02:12 2015 UTC,I thought the statue was this one of herself. I imagine she has felt her own face her whole life and is pretty aware of what she looks like.

TheLastAirbender,3duku5,megloface,6,Mon Jul 20 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"She has pretty good spatial skills, so I believe it's totally possible for her. She can pinpoint hitting a guy in the face just by ground feel, so with actual feel I think she'd be even more accurate."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,nearlyNon,3,Mon Jul 20 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"blind people can ""see"" by literally. touching things. your brain develops pathways to picture it spatially through that. so since she has tons of years to get a feel for herself she can tell that much, and her seismic sense is good enough to map out all of ba sing se as a child and pinpoint peoples' faces for punching."

I agree that she knows where people are, their general size and if they're lying or not. But not their faces that is made crystal clear when Toph tells Katara she can not return the compliment because she has no idea what she looks like. There is no arguing, they made a point of saying it."
TheLastAirbender,3duku5,nearlyNon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"But there's a lot more to aesthetics than just the facial shape. There's the coloration, whether or not there's any scar tissue as opposed to regular tissue, and so on."

Maybe, instead of showing the political process, we'll see Korra have to go into the Earth Kingdom to ensure order is maintained. Seems kind of repetitive, but perhaps she'll liberate one of Kuvira's camps. That could finally show us what we didn't see throughout Book 4.  Hopefully we'll see Korra actually visit the Fire Nation. More scenes with Izumi might be in order if she does.  Oh, and here's my wildcard: Mako will start flirting with that one dispatcher at the police station he was working with when he tried to order the city evacuation. They'll go on a date, or three. The running gag will be everyone questioning Mako about her in passing."
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,huanthewolfhound,3,Tue Jul 21 03:05:39 2015 UTC,anything about SOKKA (but they won't do that)
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,UnciaStyani,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:25 2015 UTC,Yes they will. He is definitely Suyin's dad.
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,yineedname,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:40 2015 UTC,kuvira on trial in fire nation or water tribe im thinking north not south and have earth empire extremists try to free her despite her not wanting it or red lotus try to kill her and world leaders at the trial
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,gregor-moore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think the first trilogy will revolve around Asami rebuilding Republic City and Korra involving herself in Kuvira's defense during a Nuremberg War Trials-esque set up. The world leaders are intent on giving her the ultimate punishment despite Korra and Tenzin's objections, and at the same time there is still the issue of Earth Empire remnants refusing to lay down their weapons unless they hear orders directly from Kuvira."
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,flipdark95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:29:37 2015 UTC,There's a fanfic out there where Zaheer tries to kill Kuvira once she's imprisoned. I'd really like to read something like that.
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,HagOWinter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see how Bolin ends up. He's jobless, last I checked. As well as Kuvira's trial  Spirit World trip. It's such a vast and unexplored area, and Vaatu still exists within Korra."
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,bronzebicker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:43 2015 UTC,First off this isn't a prediction.  What I want is some things that would explain more backstory to every character. Which was lost by turning three seasons worth of episodes into only four.
TheLastAirbender,3dz7ds,Ensomnlac,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:18:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know how they'll do it but I'd love if we can see more of Zaheer. A battle of ideals between him and Tenzin, maybe Zaheer could join the Air Nation and adopt their ideologies.   I'd like it if the Krew helped things out and overlooked the rebuilding of the Earth Empire and the expansion of Republic City."
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,BoIFatih,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by a ""higher"" glider?"
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,nightcreation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:17 2015 UTC,I mean like a better glider
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,nightcreation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:51 2015 UTC,"What makes the glider better? That you can go higher? The height you glide at has nothing to do with your glider, but how high you can airblast yourself."
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,Tryndameereeeeee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:33:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with these cases is that in order to add a new item, we will have to remove another item. We are already running out of items to choose from, not sure whether we could accept this. :/"
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,pancws,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:35 2015 UTC,Also gliders can go infinitely high if you're skilled enough as an air bender and are fast and functional enough as it is.
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,Tryndameereeeeee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"There are many unused Items I think, I'm not sure whether you use the nether but magma cream is unused I think"

TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,dumdum2121,0,Tue Jul 21 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"We need to plan our moves with the remaining items, whenever we are going to make a new gameplay mechanic through an item, we will need to remove one. Since we are running low on expendable items we don't want to waste it on another glider just to find out later down the line that we could really have used that item for something more usefull, something that affects all elements."
TheLastAirbender,3dzguh,Tryndameereeeeee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:35 2015 UTC,"Why dont you remove lily pads? Nobody uses them anyway, they're usless little things. Or a sword. We can't even MAKE swords, so counting the lilly pad there's 5 items right there.   A blue glider would be neat and would be more accurate to the show. The one's we use are the old style, used centuries before the time the server is set in. Airbenders have changed, Zuko, and we need a modern glider for a more civilized age. I think it should grant slightly faster gliding, slower falling, and gives a very, VERY small saturation buff while in use (cause snack compartment). BUT for balance, it's not something you should be able to craft. A glider like that needs to be made by a professional, so to get it you'd need to buy it from a merchant at one of the temples. Naturally, it wouldn't come cheap.  Also can leather armor be retextured to Glider suits? Even if they dont glide it'd still be neat (and again, it'd make the server more accurate to the show."

TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,emzeppi,3,Mon Jul 20 00:47:47 2015 UTC,I would but I don't have a scanner.
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,Spodegirl,7,Mon Jul 20 02:25:30 2015 UTC,I appreciate the thought!
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,Kaydotz,7,Mon Jul 20 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"I want a sleeve for Book 1 myself. The cover isn't that horrible though that it's not completely out of place.  I know custom game covers exist, but unfortunately nobody from the Avatar community hasn't thought to do this for their DVDs and Blu-Rays."
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,weevil_boy,4,Mon Jul 20 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my Book 1 is the only one without a sleeve.  It annoys me every time I look at my shelf.  -_-"
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,emzeppi,5,Mon Jul 20 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"So how are the blu rays? I just finished watching the series today - seasons 1 and 2 on prime, seasons 3 and 4 on DVDs from the library. Amazing show, I ordered all the blu rays as soon as I finished because I want to watch it with the commentaries."
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,weevil_boy,5,Mon Jul 20 01:22:04 2015 UTC,"I have all 4 seasons on Blu-ray. They're pretty great. The commentaries are good, too. I liked the fact that they a lot of different actors with them. They also had some of the artists and Foley people, too. So you get a lot of input on how the show was made.  My favorite commentary was probably the one with the voice actor of Varrick. Probably the most hilarious one by far."
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,slippery_ww,2,Mon Jul 20 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"I love him in pretty much anything he's in. If I had to pick a favourite, though, I'd have to say ""Best in Show"""
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,ztherion,0,Mon Jul 20 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!"
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,weevil_boy,3,Mon Jul 20 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"They're good. Video quality seems more or less fine (though I don't exactly have a trained eye). The commentary especially is fun. IIRC the middle two books have some cool, if short, BTS stuff, and Book 4 has a quick, cute little animated short (originally made for the Nick app) about Mako and Bolin's life a few years before Book 1, as well as a comic-con panel that can also be found online."
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,saintnicster,2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of in the same boat. I've been watching the series since it started, but I live in Canada so I had to watch using more...nefarious methods. I've been putting off buying the sets cause I'm poor, but I recently got my first big-boy job so I thought I'd treat myself!"
TheLastAirbender,3dw0lb,xavierkiath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:31:57 2015 UTC,From an audiovisual standpoint they're outstanding. High bitrate video and full 5.1 audio with great mixing.
