Find some other subreddits to distract you while you let your credit report strengthen :)  IMO feel free to cancel any of your clunker cards that have annual fees.  A note on the Amex, for USAA unfortunately Amex is just the credit card processor - not the card issuer. Therefore, having this card won't help you build a relationship with Amex for the purposes of getting cards like BCP."
churning,3e49j4,oniofchaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your approvals!   I think I've gotten a little bit lucky on the approval side (and really, I just kinda stumbled into the whole churning thing recently).   I originally just got the CSP earlier this year because I read that it was a good credit card to have when traveling abroad, because of the Chip + Pin & no Foreign Transaction Fees (also applied for the Barclay's Arrival+ but didn't get it), and whoala, I was approved for the CSP with a $5K limit, despite having a sub-700 score.   It's probably because I've had a previous relationship with Chase (I have a Chase Southwest + a Chase Freedom from college + I had recently opened a checking account with them), but I feel lucky as hell I was able to get the CSP with my score.   Now I'm just using my CSP to pay off two other credit cards, and using it as my only spend card (except for my Freedom card on the bonus categories), and just working on lowering my credit utilization and improving my credit score before I really let loose on the hobby.   Just feel like I got into this game a little late.  Haha."
churning,3e49j4,daoster408,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Are you able to convert your secured card instead of cancel it though? That'd be recommended if possible, then sock drawer it.  Although I wouldn't consider this a churn AOR since none of these cards really have a decent sign-up bonus(arguable). You're definitely on your way since this will boost your credit score substantially over time. It's important to have age of good credit and a good relationship with banks first more than anything."

So you can't scale up More paperwork than other MS methods Higher chance of the funding being processed as a cash advance (I'm looking at you, Citi) Some bank accounts will do a hard pull It's just generally more time consuming.

That's literally elitist. Sorry that you're no longer getting upgrades for free. Sorry that Delta is making it more accessible to the general public.

I have 316,570 AA miles and I'm an Executive Platinum.  I am changing my loyalty to Delta, so I need to burn these points while I'm still EP (they go much farther).  I want to purchase the trip this year on AA Vacations, but travel in 2016. Dates are completely flexible.  My wife and I do not yet have kids.

churning,3e29bj,Bullbalz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm leaving AA because on 27 trips last year, two went off as planned.

Granted, I fly American Eagle often, but the bottom line is that AA is miserable when it comes to service since the merger.   I start at XNA (Northwest Arkansas).

From the other side, Cathay Pacific offers flights from Dallas to LAX (probably AA codeshare), and from there to east asia on their excellent product. Given your hatred of AA, you'd have to chance their Dallas-LAX flight getting you there on time.  Both these airlines have great first/business class product, so would be a good choice for burning a large stack of miles. Japan airlines is the other contender, again direct flight from Dallas to Tokyo I think.

Perks being no fuel surcharges or any real complications and there is great availability if you book early.   Where do you fly from? East coast to Portugal with Avios or possibly Aer Lingus/Berlin (although these are Ireland and Germany) are all excellent if you can find dates, costing as low as only 25k roundtrip per person.     If you're not east coast, you could lurk for an AirBlue promotion.  They drop RT US-> European tickets to 25k (normally 50k).  Transfer partners are Amex, Citi ThankYou, and I think SPG.  I'm not sure which airports they serve outside of their hubs nor the availability of this promotion during summer. Maybe someone can give more insight than that. It would seem to me that if you're fine flying coach and using a lot of points, AA would be the most straightforward answer and among the most reliable.

So, your SO should sign-up for a Chase CSP, and then the 50K UA deal that is available in branch, or wait until that deal comes back online.  You should also get the 50K United deal.  With your SO transferring some UR points to you, and then each of you transferring UR to UA, each of you would have 80K UA, enough to book the trip.

Not sure about Wal-Mart, I haven't set foot in one in nearly 10 years and not about to any time soon.  In my experiences, more mom & pop shops have working chip readers, because they don't use integrated POS systems so it's easy for them to upgrade by just getting new card readers.

For longer distance trains, there will almost always be a counter where they can serve you with an attendant if you don't want to pay cash.  If you need fuel, make sure the station has an attendant. The kiosk only station is more common in N. Europe, I go to Belgium and Netherlands fairly commonly for work and see it there all the time.  Down here in S. Europe where salaries are a lot lower, it's still kind of common to have full service and there is almost always an attendant. Some stations do close in more rural areas, though. Depending on the country, you may have to watch out for attendants on Sundays. Here in Spain, the Sunday work restrictions are really low (pretty similar to the US) so things are generally open all the time these days (things closed a lot more before the crisis and labor reforms).

Chip & Pin vs Chip & Signature is based on a priority list IN YOUR SPECIFIC CREDIT CARD. Only if the terminal doesn't actually support PIN will it fall to another CVM.

I was able to use it as chip and pin just like any European credit card after it was properly activated. Even worked for a bike from the kiosk in Paris which does not accept any form of payment other than chip and pin. This card still works as chip and sig in the US. I've been to a number of gas stations and big box stores where the only way this card works is in the chip reader, but it works swipe and sig at those that don't have a chip reader. I've not experienced anywhere with a chip reader machine where chip and sig didn't work with that card. I also don't see chip readers many places, other than certain big box stores (Walmart, Target, Home Depot locally) and a small local chain of gas stations.   Edit: Re: chip readers in stores  I have read in reliable tech blogs / forums US chip readers in larger stores like Walmart do have chip and pin capability, but the stores or their banks choose to not turn it on. There is purportedly some sort of attempt to legislate a move to chip and pin as this system puts more of the security onus on cardholders which is currently on those who accept the cards and banks, but if I recall correctly that was supposedly going to require banks issue chip and pin cards by next January which I don't see happening.   Second Edit: I've not witnessed anywhere in the US having the portable chip reader machines like they had in Europe. It was really nice to never have to let people like wait staff at restos haul my card off out of sight. I've had fraud attempted on three different occasions immediately following it being removed from my sight in a resto to charge, and I no longer use my card anywhere it will be out of my sight.

churning,3e07e2,jbkilluh,3,Tue Jul 21 05:45:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The CSR implied that my current chipless card was the problem, not the terminal, but I don't think that's the case. I think we'd see a panic if we suddenly had to wait for a new chip card to be issued."
churning,3e07e2,tmiw,2,Mon Jul 20 23:43:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it should still have worked without the chip. I don't think we're that far along on the chip thing to think about getting rid of the magstripe altogether.
churning,3e07e2,sexy_kitten7,3,Mon Jul 20 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Chip terminals will only run mag stripes if the card is chipless. If there's a chip, they force you to dip. They are psychic."

churning,3e07e2,sexy_kitten7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:01 2015 UTC,Many retailers have installed chip terminals but deactivated that functionality. That's what I suspect is happening. I also tried to chip at a Sprouts Market here and it wouldn't take it.  Of course the cashier had never heard of a chip in his life. So that's probably the rationale behind deactivating!

You would think activating them months before the deadline would give time for people to get accustomed to using them before they stop having a choice.
churning,3e07e2,TheResPublica,2,Tue Jul 21 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"Fallback is going to be a common occurrence... And many simply aren't ready.

churning,3e07e2,simmiedude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"I imagine if they mandate that VGCs need a chip, MSing will also become more expensive also. Those EMV chips ARE NOT cheap at all."
churning,3e07e2,yeshu1984,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Also, I feel like this will increase scrutiny from cashiers who will probably notice the card being inserted is a VGC and then immediately say that they cannot be used. As others have mentioned, I don't think the magstripe is going anywhere. Chip based cards will become more mainstream, but it will take a long time before magstripe readers are replaced."
churning,3e07e2,TheResPublica,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:01 2015 UTC,The transition to EMV is going to literally take years. The only european countries that have even discussed getting rid of mag stripe acceptance are the Scandinavians and they've floated anywhere from 2023 to 2025 as the target years despite launching EMV way back in 2004   There is no way it was because it lacked a chip.

His brother was 'ivy league bound' that doesn't mean anything other than he was hardworking and smart. He also died while riding a jet ski. It doesn't say that they owned it, they could have been renting a jet ski which the average 9 to 5er certainly can afford. Sure, his parents likely aren't poor, but they don't necessarily have to be loaded either.   The family relocated to Tampa and the Ben went to University of Florida. Hardly a rich person's school.   More than a few people are able to maintain blogs as their full time jobs, in addition to hiring on additional people to help them maintain it. Ben's blog is one of the most popular ones out there, I have no doubt that he's able to make 6 figures off it. In addition to that, if he doesn't actually have to pay rent that's additional money to spend flying around randomly."
churning,3dzd7v,midnightblade,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"While I don't agree with /u/White_Thundur I noted that the article states Ben earned elite status at 16.  That is a lot of flying, and even with mistake fares, that still costs real money. I think it is fair to say he certainly was privileged at the very least."
churning,3dzd7v,Solonas,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that elite status in 2005-2006 (when he was 16) wasn't as hard to obtain as it is today. United elite status (1P) at the time was still earned based on miles flown, not cost of ticket, and from what I can tell, it took 50,000 miles to get 1P status. The lower status before that (2P) only took 25,000 miles and gave a 25% bonus on all miles earned.   If he was taking the route mentioned in the article from TPA>ORD>SFO>LAX and back again, he was getting about 6,400. It would only take 4 of those trips to reach 2P status which would have given him roughly 8,000 per trip, and only another 3 to make it to 1P at 50k miles. It also mentioned he did ORD>ITM>SFO>ICN that year which (I'm too lazy to research the # of miles) would have most certainly put him to or near to 50k miles.   Yes is still cost money and took a bit of flying, but for someone who knew what to look for in terms of flights and tricks to get low/cheap fares, it wouldn't take much. He started at 13, and by 16 I'm sure he was able to find absurdly cheap mistake fares, etc. to use for mileage runs. Pair that with the 2006 promo that United Air ran that doubled all elite qualifying miles for a flat rate of $499 (no proof he took advantage of this, just used as an example), and it could be gained pretty easily for someone with his mindset.  I don't doubt that it probably cost a couple grand to get there, but over the course of a year, it's not beyond reason that he was able to do it for only a small investment. I can't argue that his parents didn't help fund a portion, but I can't imagine that he didn't work a part time job during his down time to help fund his trips either. I was making ~$800/month from a 20hr/week part time job in 2003 when I was 16. Over the course of a 3 month summer break, that's easily ~$2,400 and certainly enough to get the flights needed. He could have been asking for certain itineraries from family members for his Birthday and X-Mas presents too for all we know. Hardly a privileged life if that holds true."

I'm don't fly for my work and probably never will and with the revenue based system I'll never achieve status. I believe the problem is your concept of being privileged differs from mine. I've worked since I was 15 but there were no jobs paying $10 an hour to teens where I grew up, if you made anything more than minimum wage you were lucky. My grandparents gave me $25 every year for Christmas and my birthday, no flight iteneraries in my card :( So I think we are definitely coming from drastically different places when talking about what being privileged means."

churning,3dzd7v,evarga,3,Mon Jul 20 23:00:03 2015 UTC,I don't think he has to MS at all. He has a legit business (the blog and his points booking business) that provide enough overhead spend to generate a significant amount of miles. But more importantly the affiliate links on his blog generate a significant amount of money/miles for him to book these flights. Although people on r/churning may not click his affiliate links I'd venture that plenty of people do. Im sure he is also given miles from programs to test out a new product so there are many avenues that he earns points/miles.

You may not have the full transfer or bonus benefits as say if you had a personal platinum card (i.e. tiers of Membership Rewards)  Since I believe Amex ties your Membership Rewards to your social security number, if you have an eligible personal card (say the Platinum) it will combine your rewards accounts together from your corporate and personal account. However, to earn MR points on your corporate card, you still need to pay the annual fee of $90 to enroll (and as /u/thiseye says, it really depends on your company's exact agreement). The good thing here though is Amex makes all your points as useful as the highest tier available.

churning,3dxq8j,jbkilluh,5,Mon Jul 20 23:54:01 2015 UTC,"Aside from AoR's generally being less popular as a method due to near instant reporting of hard pulls, If you're going to attempt an AOR anyways, the best method is to pre fill the apps and submit them all instantaneously (or as close to at the same time as possible). Hard inquiries are generally perceived to show up in real time, but there is a small chance of the inquiry showing up on your report after a few seconds due to a slight lag, this is about the only chance you have of an AoR being successful, but it would be very difficult to get more than 2-3 apps submitted in time. Of course this only matters if you know which report the card issuer is going to pull. If one pulls Experian and the other is TransUnion, you could wait weeks in between the apps and each issuer will never see the others inquiry. You just have to apply before the new account shows up on both reports which is generally after its first closing statement.   The other plausible benefit of an AoR is related to your second question - hard inquiries being combined. They would only be combined if the inquires are requested by the same banks on the same day to the same bureau. Chances of them being combined are increased the closer together they are (think a few seconds) and if the apps are processed by the same department. Some companies process their business cards and personal card through different departments, so if they have different names or phone numbers (Ex: Chase, and Chase Business) they wouldn't likely be combined since they wouldn't be seen as a duplicate.   With Chase it's generally successful when applying for two personal cards at once, with AMEX it's generally combined when applying for two personal charge cards at once, and though it doesn't seem to be as common to be approved for both automatically, reports of 1 personal credit and 1 personal charge card combined exist. You can't apply for two Amex personal credit cards on the same day, which is the same for Citi. Do a Google search for ""Doctor of Credit Combine Hard Inquiries"" to learn a bit more."

For example, a while back I was seeing availability non-stop DFW to MAD, but now it seems like EVERY flight I check from DFW to Europe is routing through LHR (and getting the associated taxes/fees).

No stopovers allowed, but very cheap off season economy rates (40k instead of 60k economy).   United is partnered with Lufthansa and Turkish, both offer low surcharges and pretty good availability. They also allow a stopover, meaning more flexibility. You'd probably have to route through Denver or Newark. on most routes. They are also partnered with Swiss, Scandinavian air and Brussels air, although I have no personal experience there. Probably the best list of European partners out there.  Alaska is interesting. They don't have many European partners, but many of their Asian partners stop in Europe on the way over. For example you could take Alaska to JFK, then change onto Singapore to Frankfurt. This might be a good option if you do flying in your local region as well. Partners include BA, Air France and KLM from Europe. Their signup bonus is stingy (25k) compared to others.

I did a little research comparing our options for getting a card, spending $200K in a year, and redeeming the miles for a trip from SEA to LON in April.      Cash Alaska BA AA    Card City Cash 2% Alaska Business Chase BA Citi Business AA Advantage Executive   Reward WIth 200K Spend $4,000 225,000 Miles 250,000 Miles +1 TravelTogether 275,000 +   RoundTrip SEA -> LON (Low Season) Tickets Available WIth Award 4 3.75 6 6.875    So at first it looks like AA gives the most bang for the buck.  But the I actually punched in some numbers.  Flying from SEA to LHR on a 20,000 mile award ticket I'd be on BA, and I'm going to be paying about $700/ticket worth of fees on top of any mileage awards, when I could just buy the whole ticket for ~$1,000 ea.    I know London has ridiculous fees, so I checked out Edinburgh, and the fees were even higher.    The only way to avoid them would be to fly on an actual AA flight, but those are 65,000 miles each way.  Just for fun I tried Delta.  Their round-trip tickets were 135K miles and $300 in fees.   It looks like for our needs, focusing on cashback is our best value if we're planning to use our rewards for airfare to Europe.  But let me know if I've missed something obvious."
churning,3dxq8j,shinypenny01,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"It's not just London that's bad for fees, but the UK in general, so that's why Edinburgh was bad as well. If you search somewhere on the continent you'll see the fees go down. I think the UK is about $200. BA obviously adds fuel surcharges onto that.  I don't know how you like to travel, but if you are flexible and plan in advance there are some good deals out there. For example, Alaska flights are bookable on AA award flights, but not searchable on the AA website. If you search on the Alaska website (ignoring the other partner flights) you might have more routing luck. Alaska follows the pricing of their partner airlines, which means you can get AA's discount price regardless of who you book through if you are travelling AS & AA or just AA. As an example, there are 16 days next April where you can get to Paris (CDG) from Seattle for 20k miles each for two people (two economy seats available). These are bookable with AA or Alaska miles for 20k each way (connect in Philly or Chicago). Total fees about $110 for 2 tickets round trip.  One other thing to consider, if there are two people travelling, you have enough miles for both people to travel business class to europe each year. I don't know how you value that personally, but it's certainly priced at more than $4,000. Availability can be tough, but again, if you're flexible it might work. Focus on finding good business flights from a hub (like Chicago) then team them up with whatever works best from Seattle (even if it is coach).  There's no best answer for everyone. If you're a last minute budget traveler then maybe the cash is best for you, but there are some options with the miles that might work.  P.S. if you want to go to Europe and see multiple cities/countries, flying into the UK, and flying out of somewhere else means you skip UK taxes (they only charge them on outbound flights). The train to Paris is only 50 pounds :)"
churning,3dxq8j,AtOurGates,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you again for the detailed explanation.  I didn't realize that the UK's fees were so much higher.  And part of the issue is that BA has quite a few SEA -> Europe direct flights.  Your tip about starting at another hub and working backwards could be very helpful.   I would definitely prefer to fly business, but I'd rather fly our family of 5 to Europe every year or two economy, than wait 4-5 years to get enough miles to fly business.  The other issue is that our kids are too young to split off into separate itineraries. Of course, if I could fly us business every year or two, all the better.  But I think even if that's possible, I'd have to dedicate my life to churning and MS.    Planning ahead's not an issue.  We tend to plan our major vacations 6+ months out in any regard.    Thanks again for all the advice.  I appreciate it!"
churning,3dxq8j,shinypenny01,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't realize it was 5 people! That complicates it a bit. The SEA-CDG route has 5x tickets at 20k miles each on 17 days between April and the first half of May (one way price). So some choice, but clearly the more tickets you need to book the tougher it is.  Good luck with the vacation planning, and if you have questions you know where to find us!"
churning,3dxq8j,zer0cul,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"Since you have 5 travelers and that makes award flights harder if you are super flexible on destination and date you could go for cashback and use the flight deal.  Most of them are US/Caribbean/South America and several Asia, but there are a few European destinations scattered around.  Denmark  Amsterdam or Paris  With this method there are no guarantees, but the worst case scenario is having cash to spend toward whatever vacation you choose.  Notice: cash devalues at around 0-3% per year, more than some airline points, less than others."

The Ink Plus does not follow the 5 card rule; however, it's not easy to get approval for.  Best bet is to apply online, but when you get pending status (which you will likely) just wait until you get a hard denial in the mail.

Looking at award search at  http://wandr.me/Award-Search/Avios-Map/IAH shows very limited ability.   I will be traveling domestically in the near future.   Am booking a trip for Maui using 17.5k AA miles each way for October.
churning,3dxq8j,bikingnoob,3,Mon Jul 20 12:44:51 2015 UTC,Avios is definitely best option for short haul flights with One World partners.
churning,3dxq8j,the_fit_hit_the_shan,5,Mon Jul 20 13:28:02 2015 UTC,"Fellow Houstonian here: no, Avios are not nearly as valuable for us as they would be for someone in DFW. Avios are only valuable on direct flights, so if you travel to those handful of cities (http://wandr.me/Award-Search/Avios-Map/Iah) often they can be very useful. You can also use them to get to a coastal hub in one of those cities for an international reward flight."
churning,3dxq8j,moezaly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I was wondering. The number of cities are limited in the map. But, can't any AA route be booked using this?"
churning,3dxq8j,jbkilluh,4,Mon Jul 20 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Avios needed for a redemption are distance based. If you're flying less than 2,000 miles, they offer a better deal than using AA. If your flying 2,001-3,000 they offer the same value, so it depends on which one you have more of, or need to save for a different redemption. If you're flying over 3k miles domestically, AA is a better redemption when compared directly, caveat being if you need to save your AA miles for an international redemption, it would be OK to use Avios to get to a hub in order to use your AA, even if it costs more Avios. Generally speaking though, one way flights are pretty cheap and you'd be getting a better value by paying for the one way flight and getting miles from the trip."

churning,3dxq8j,the_fit_hit_the_shan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. The problem is that once you start stringing those short routes together, the savings tend to disappear when compared to other miles. IAH to BDL is 24,000 Avios RT if I connect in Charlotte, but the availability is far worse than if I used 25,000 Delta Skymiles to book that route."

churning,3dxq8j,tehwebguy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"Avios are good for booking short haul domestic flights on their partners since one-ways start at 4,500 Avios + $5.60, about as cheap as it gets. AA on the other hand starts award travel at 12,500 (with a few discounted exceptions based on destination if you have certain credit cards)  For long-haul, premium cabins or almost anything with a connection, however, Avios are not very valuable. Every leg is priced individually, which is not beneficial in many cases.  That said, the BA Visa is a fairly easy 50k Avios, if you can make the minimum spend without much effort it's not a bad deal for some freebies."

I have $9650 in student loans and I would like to split that in thirds to cover the initial spending requirement of 3k for the following cards: Citi Thank you Premier, Citi Prestige, and Amex Platinum. I would then redeem the 50k Citi points towards $500 in loans (repeat for the other card). I will do the Amex last and simply use Serve (does loading Serve count towards the initial spending requirements?).  My main question is how to go about paying the loans using the 2 Citi cards. Digging through the archives, I see that Evolve was once a viable option but now charges 3% for both PP Debit and CCs. (is this correct)? What would you recommend instead of eating the 3%? (which would total $180 that I would really like to avoid if possible). Possible loading of Serve offline w/ VGCs? Is this an option?"
churning,3dxq8j,shinypenny01,2,Mon Jul 20 14:47:40 2015 UTC,Your student loan is basically irrelevant for meeting min spend. From serve/redbird you can just use the cash (received through VGC) to pay your CC and keep the bonus.   Just pay your loan from your checking account where necessary.

churning,3dwl1z,LiteHedded,5,Mon Jul 20 06:43:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I would say redemptions are an even larger part of churning than MS.   Sure MS is horribly useful in hitting minimum spends quickly, racking up some easy targeted bonuses or topping off points/miles needed, but redemptions are the ultimate end game and the very reason that many of us churn.   You don't need to MS to churn cards, but the end goal will always be the redemption of the bonuses you're receiving through churns."

As an avid Avios collector (I'm based in MAD, so they are really useful to me) I would also point out that both frequently have 25% transfer bonuses."
churning,3dwl1z,LupineChemist,2,Mon Jul 20 08:55:46 2015 UTC,"Question - Can you actually 'transfer' from Iberia to Avios (in the same manner MR transfers to Delta, for example), or can you just book BA flights with Iberia points (similar to how you can use Avios to book AA flights)?    The two are not the same, and it is important to clarify."
churning,3dwl1z,vtfan08,3,Mon Jul 20 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"This is a bit more complicated. The answer to both of your questions is actually yes. You can move avios to any other avios scheme (which will soon include Aer Lingus as well). So for the time being, BA Exec Club, Iberia Plus and avios.com (needs a UK or ZA address)   Now, within Iberia, the terms are generally pretty lousy for any flight that isn't Iberia operated (though they are actually a pretty good airline). It can be useful to get to Europe from N. America via Madrid as their fees are much lower although AirBerlin is still the lowest fee carrier. BA's policy is much more flexible and their booking engine works infinitely better for partners (though still has its problems)  At the end of the day, especially if you want AA domestics, you should use the BA engine for anything that's not an Iberia/Iberia Express/Air Nostrum/Vueling flight.  Also with Vueling flights, be sure to check the cash fare as it's often not worth the opportunity cost of the avios as the tickets can be so cheap just paying cash. (if you fly Vueling, be sure to credit to Iberia Plus in order to get even more avios)"

It depends if you plan on taking 0 or 10 flights before December.  If you fly a lot, then UR points is the best route.  If you don't fly much at all, general spend is fine.

Amex will typically reference their most recent pull as basis for denials so if you get denied, they won't do a hard pull again. If they approve you based on the most recent report they have, they usually do another formal hard pull for final verification, so it would be likely that they will be combined by the bureau. If it goes to pending, I would wait as long as possible for an approval via email later today, but definitely call recon before they close and ask what's up. If they say it needs to go to manual review, chances are it will be pulled again when it gets there and that could be tomorrow or a day later. Might be best to just ask to cancel the application to prevent that.

Not sure what you mean by this. I am going to assume you mean the UR point program looks really limited, mostly because you don't like United? I would say the UR program definitely the most extensive (compared to MR and TY), and fewer people actually use United miles to book United flights. The value of the UA program is being able to book flights on Star Alliance partners such as Swiss, Lufthansa, EVA, ANA, etc. where very good values can be found.  And to answer your original question: the main value in the Venture is the sign up bonus. You have probably used that up already so canceling it once the AF hits and rolling with the double cash and freedom sounds fine.  Perhaps reconsider your stance on the CSP/UR, however. Half the value of the Freedom is its ability to link up with the CSP and transfer its points to frequent flyer programs and hotel loyalty programs."

churning,3duobr,mi0003,8,Mon Jul 20 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"The trick was to buy a $10 GC with your first Amex card, get $10 back ($0 profit).

Then buy a $12 GC with your previous GC ($11) and your third Amex card ($1), get $10 back ($18 profit). And so on. Effectively you would get $0 profit from your first Amex card then $9 profit from each additional Amex card you have.  When word started getting out they removed the variable amount GCs from their website so it's not possible to do this anymore.  Unless they removed the ability to pay for GCs with GCs though, you can still increment the GCs by $10 each time then place a fairly big free order using your last GC (it just won't be a money maker)."
churning,3duobr,mk712,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:17:38 2015 UTC,Why increment the gift card by $10 each time?  Why not just buy multiple $10 gift cards?  Any advantage?

Then you can checkout with a $11 gift card, apply the $10 gift card you just purhcased, and have a balance of $1.  Use that on your Amex Checkout ($1) and get reimbursed $10.  Then you could buy a $12 card, use the $11 one you have, balance of $1... etc etc etc.  Worked flawlessly for awhile.  Basically profited $0 on one card, but then you would profit $9 each Amex card you have after that.  Now Sabon doesn't allow custom GC amounts.  Even a $100 gift card from that store would do most of us no use."

Some stores (I think Family Dollar) don't sell the Vanilla Reloads cards you take home, but rather a card you bring up to the register and pay for there (so the reload happens there). This is how I understand it, but have never bought Vanilla Reloads this way. I used to buy them at CVS. I'm pretty sure Target doesn't sell Vanilla Reloads, though."
churning,3dvjih,ridonkulouschicken,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:26 2015 UTC,Anyone? Nearby gas station sells them and allows purchasing via CC so it could be a perfect spot for MS ing on 5X gas points.

He seemed a little sketched out so I tried making some small talk and it seemed that he didn't mind me buying $1000 in GCs.   Then I go to work for a 12 hour shift and after work I thought to myself ""maybe my Tia is working now, I'll swing by and pick up another $1000 in VGCs"". I get there and a part timer was there to ring me up, which was fine until she got to the part where she actually had to process the gift card.    She then calls ""Frank"" over her walkie talkie to come and help her out. Frank comes up and Frank happens to be the store manager that sold me $1000 earlier. This time he was definitely sketched out after I wanted another grand in gift cards in the same day. So I get a little nervous thinking that he's going to turn me down and the gig is finally up.

I keep track of last use in my master cc sheet. I've got 22 open cards.   guidelines have specific lenders made public regarding the reclassification of an account as inactive?   The issue of ""inactivity"" is related to account closures but that term specifically refers to facet of FICO scoring. That is, all closed accounts were inactive but not all inactive accounts are closed. The algorithm will start to ignore accounts you're clearly not using.

My SWAG would be along the lines of the usual criteria to establish a credit score at all: if a tradeline has not reported / date of last activity not updated, within the last 6 months, it may be discounted.  That said the number of lenders who won't report a $0 balance is getting fortunately rare, Synchrony (who has the least consumer friendly practices of anyone in my estimation when it comes to reporting) is a glaring exception, but none of the majors do though I have no personal experience with Citi, never seen that reported previously."

churning,3dr21n,LumpyLump76,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:56 2015 UTC,"To answer your title question- No. To answer your other question, it depends on your usage. For example, I drive a little more than an hour to get to work and class 5x a week (about 120 miles + at least $5 in tolls/ day- if I have to drive down to Miami it can be worse because the tolls are traffic congestion based and can be like $9 each way). So for my uses, getting those extra points for gas and tolls makes a huge difference- the 2 additional points over the competitors from the minimum I pay in tolls are worth about 1/2 the AF alone.  And while I travel internationally once or twice a year, the Amex Platinum has many of the same benefits as the Prestige- so I would prefer to cancel/churn the Prestige because you can't churn personal Amex cards and because I don't want to lose out on those 18 months of point bonuses with the Premier. Plus, (I don't have any data points for this) but there's nothing in the language of the Premier that says you don't earn the bonuses for spending internationally- so all the money you spend on mass transit while abroad adds up too.  However, if you have spending that can earn bonuses on other cards then you can use those to earn your bonuses while in the waiting period to qualify for the Premier again.    The other thing you have to be careful of is that the TYP are linked to the cards that earned them, so if you cancel the Premier (or Prestige) then those points will expire in like 90 days (I think) unless you transfer them to another program (I'm pretty sure that all the transfer partners points have expiration dates too)."

churning,3dny83,disneycal,0,Sat Jul 18 07:43:25 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I'm pretty sure (y)our options are going to be pretty limited. Amex is pretty damn inconsistent with what they offer for PC. They seem to offer the Hilton card most often from what I read and sometimes the Everyday or BCE. Sometimes nothing at all outside the Delta family of cards.  I'm assuming you want to go no fee if they won't give you a retention bonus so in that case there is also that new Plenti card that I'm sure they're trying to push. I have Nationwide insurance but I would probably just sock drawer it as I prefer to build 2x UR points through my CSP. But it would keep the relationship with Amex. Right now it is my only card with them so I wouldn't want to lose the history before transferring the available credit to whatever card of theirs I go for next and close the account.

churning,3dny83,sweetcarz02,0,Sat Jul 18 19:47:28 2015 UTC,I don't believe so. You may want to apply for the SPG first though. That gives you some leverage as far as transferring available credit to open the new line. After you get the SPG you can transfer all but $500 of your Delta Gold line and close it down. At least I believe they keep $500 on it for some kind of reporting reason when you close it.  I think it would be more beneficial to go this route but I don't believe that cancelling a card prior to applying for another one raises any flags unless it is the same card. But with Amex you can only get bonuses once anyway so I doubt they even care about that anymore.

churning,3domlr,the_fit_hit_the_shan,2,Sat Jul 18 00:20:24 2015 UTC,"Careful with this. It's actually against Serve's T&C to do bill pay on your linked CC. Instead, I use bill pay to pay off a different card."
churning,3domlr,gnutello,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:03:42 2015 UTC,What exactly do you mean by this?
churning,3domlr,the_fit_hit_the_shan,2,Sat Jul 18 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"Are you wanting to use Serve as a banking product or just to manufacture some spend? If you just want to MS, just load Serve and then bill pay the card you used to load. Then pay your rent however you usually pay it."
churning,3domlr,the_fit_hit_the_shan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:30 2015 UTC,Yup I am trying to MS these cards. So basically with this method you are getting spend on a card and then sending the resulting Serve check to pay off the card? So I am guaranteed $1k spend every calendar month and can just write a normal check for rent. Ever have any problems with your CC receiving the check payment?  Edit: added question

Reasons being: If it's a hard pull for raising CL and also a hard pull for a new card. Why not just get a new card with good bonus?  If you need temporary higher limit on your card, you can talk to the bank and see what options you have. They might be able to temp. raise your limit, or maybe you can prepay. It depends.  Also, some banks don't do HP for raising CL, a good example is American Express (under some conditions). Doctor of Credit has some pretty good articles on beginner tips."

Here is the answer in the FAQ:  Serve Walmart/Family Dollar/Greendot Cash/Debit Load combined Limit: $2500 per day, $5000 per month  Per transactions?  That is actually location specific.  Every Walmart makes up their own rule on that.  Which leads to this comment in the write-up:  the CSR may tell you that the Max Load is $20, or $200, or the square root of 75. None of it is correct, but anything is possible. Just go with it."

churning,3dkivn,trilll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:18 2015 UTC,I cancel everything with an annual fee. But I also have a few really old cards with no annual fee anchoring things down.
churning,3dkivn,HawKarma,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"You should have no problem getting a retention offer on the Aviator. Your downgrade plan looks fine, but I've never tried downgrading those cards. Personally I just call and see what they offer. If it's got no fee I'll probably take it. It's not going to get any use anyway, it becomes a sock drawer card."
churning,3dkivn,shinypenny01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:10 2015 UTC,You're not worried having too much total credit? Or too many accounts with one bank? Or other stuff that would adversely affect future apps?
churning,3dkivn,lamarcus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:14:29 2015 UTC,"With the aviator, barclays only has one really appealing product left (the arrival+) so I doubt too many accounts is going to hurt you there.   Amex I like to have no more than 3 accounts when I apply, Chase 3 or 4. I prefer to have no more than $30k-$40k credit with any one bank. More and I think it'll probably only hurt my chances. Citi is more generous with accounts, I don't worry about them.  These are just my personal preferences, others may work by different guidelines."
churning,3dkivn,shinypenny01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:11:58 2015 UTC,"Do any cards have benefits you're really interested in keeping?  I will note that the Aviator and Forward are no longer open to new applications, so I would not close those.  Also, it seems like you if you cancel your Premier or Prestige card, you will lose any TYPs from those accounts even if combined with another card, so burn all those before you cancel either of those cards."
churning,3dkivn,KiddKaffeine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:07:44 2015 UTC,"AMEX Delta - Last year, I was offered a couple thousand miles to keep it open, not enough to justify the annual fee. Probably close/downgrade it unless you want the free baggage or something.  AMEX BCP - Evaluate your spending on the card. If you use it enough to justify the annual fee, keep it. Otherwise, downgrade to BCE. If you're borderline, consider if BCE + Barclays Sallie Mae would work for you (saving you the annual fee).  Barclays A+ - Not sure how the regular Arrival works, but if you have points on this you might want to redeem them asap.  Citi Premier/Prestige - If you cancel these cards, make sure you've used/transferred all your points."
churning,3dkivn,oniofchaos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:22:52 2015 UTC,I'm confused about how you missed the double bonus on the discover it card--the last day isn't til the end of this month.
churning,3dl9zu,mi0003,5,Fri Jul 17 04:41:11 2015 UTC,"I'm using the Wallaby app.  I like the ""Which card to use"" feature."
churning,3dl9zu,jdguy00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:31 2015 UTC,Have you connected your banks too with the app to track rewards? I am wondering if it's a good idea.
churning,3dl9zu,newtoca,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:03 2015 UTC,I did link up and it does have useful information like your overall credit utilization and statement end dates
churning,3dl9zu,jdguy00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"That's it? I have /u/dugup46 's spreadsheet that does that and then some.  Thanks for the reply, appreciate it."
churning,3dl9zu,newtoca,2,Sat Jul 18 00:06:55 2015 UTC,I feel like making an online version if the spreadsheet. I think it has the potential to be so much more baller than it is in its current state.
churning,3dl9zu,dugup46,2,Sat Jul 18 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"I can help you with that, I know a few things about Django and SQL."
churning,3dl9zu,newtoca,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"I just know some basic PHP and SQL, could whip something nice up using a bootstrap template.  It's not so much the programming as it is the time and money.  I don't have the free time to make a nice website :(  Well I do... I just prefer to allocate that time to other things haha."
churning,3dl9zu,dugup46,6,Sat Jul 18 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I'm currently working with advanced and newbie churners on a web/app solution. I'd love your feedback! www.trackandhackapp.com  We're looking to add a MSing tracking feature to it as well."

churning,3dl9zu,ashtrack,2,Fri Jul 17 12:06:32 2015 UTC,How would it be better than a google doc? Google doc is simple effective customizable and portable. I just don't see how any app could be any better.
churning,3dl9zu,honeybadger1984,4,Fri Jul 17 10:48:42 2015 UTC,"I would imagine an app that can send you phone notifications of reminders to call to ask about membership or annual renewal fees to be easier than constantly checking an excel. That, combined with inputs/tracking on fees, bonus points, minimum spends, etc would be way easier than a excel/Google doc."
churning,3dl9zu,1stKillalltheLawyers,2,Fri Jul 17 12:06:20 2015 UTC,"Lots of other possibilities too like letting you know when you could churn a card again or tracking your manufactured spend liquidation, etc etc"
churning,3dl9zu,phoenix7,0,Fri Jul 17 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"I use excel.  I always trust myself and my own judgment before relying on an app.  It only takes checking once a week to settle all my affairs, so it's better than using alerts."

churning,3dl9zu,ashtrack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"It should let you put in your own point valuation.  Right now, it just tells me to use my clubcarlson almost everywhere."
