SympatheticMonsters,39qv13,JesterOfDestiny,2,Sun Jun 14 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"Huitzilopochtli:       In the Aztec religion, Huitzilopochtli (Classical Nahuatl: Huītzilōpōchtli /wi:t͡siloːˈpoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi/), is a Mesoamerican deity of war, sun, human sacrifice and the patron of the city of Tenochtitlan. He was also the national god of the Mexicas, also known as Aztecs, of Tenochtitlan. Many in the pantheon of deities of the Aztecs were inclined to have a fondness for a particular aspect of warfare. However, Huitzilopochtli was known as the primary god of war in ancient Mexico. Since he was the patron god of the Mexica, he was credited with both the victories and defeats that the Mexica people had on the battlefield.  It is important to remember that the defeat of their patron deity meant the defeat of his people. This is one of the many reasons why they were concerned with providing exquisite tribute and food for him. Not only was it important for him to survive his battles, but the fate of the Mexica people would have rested in the victory of Huitzilopochtli.

SympatheticMonsters,33v7hl,chalkchick0,2,Sun Apr 26 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"For those who may not play MTG, there's a story behind this monster. This creature is from the ""Khans/Dragons of Tarkir"" storyline, which involves a bit of time travel. I'm sure this'll make what the community has dubbed ""Durdle Turtle"" even more sympathetic.   In the original timeline, dragons are extinct and he's a gigantic turtle with a city on his back. Some of the most wealthy individuals of the society he belonged to lived there and generally did things that flaunted how rich and powerful they were. The turtle was oblivious of most of this, and generally did what it pleased. (card/art for the creature here: http://magiccards.info/scans/en/ktk/141.jpg) The MTG community fell in love with the turtle just because of how silly it is.   Flash forward a few months, and some events happened in the past that changed the timeline. Dragons did not all die out, and the one in particular that began to rule over the domain of this poor turtle killed it and all of its residents to show his power. While he was at it, the dragon revived the turtle as a zombie to serve as a warning for those who oppose him.   The poor turtle just wanted to meander ;~;"
