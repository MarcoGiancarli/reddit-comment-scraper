berlin,3e3soz,cYzzie,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:40:05 2015 UTC,Because the website doesnt really have much ticket information in English. I see one game in the Match Day Information and its not even a Bundesliga game.
berlin,3e3soz,EB3031,4,Tue Jul 21 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"That's because tickets for Bundesliga matches aren't sold yet. Keep checking this site in German, it says that starting in early August, they will show the ticket prices for the first few home matches. The cheapest tickets cost 15 Euros, but you will probably not find any tickets in these areas because they're almost entirely taken by people with season tickets. The cost of tickets in other areas varies from opponent to opponent (I think it's three categories), the cheapest tickets should be around 22 Euros. Here is a stadium plan, the prices are for season tickets, but you can see the differently priced areas of the stadium, the blue (not light blue, cheapest areas) sectors are your best bet for cheap tickets.  Here you can find out for which Union games they already sell tickets (under ""Heimspiele"" written in red). If you scroll down further you'll find a list of shops that sell tickets and their addresses (under the Google Maps picture). The cheapest tickets are sold for ~15 € too. 2. Bundesliga starts three weeks before the Bundesliga, so tickets for some Union matches are already being sold.  What do you mean by ""Season Supports""? Season tickets? There's a link for the Hertha prices already in this comment.  Season tickets for Union start at 165 € without reduced costs (for club members, school/university students amongst others)."

berlin,3e3kyp,Colipedia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"Hey there, fellow Canadian! Berlin apartments are still very affordable compared to cities of similar size in Canada. Within the ring, a room in a shared flat goes for around €350-450 nowadays; outside the ring, around €250-300. Compared to the $600/room rents in Kitchener or $800/room rents in Toronto for a tiny closet, Berlin is really affordable for students. There's no reason at all to actually live outside of Berlin. You would be putting yourself at a huge disadvantage when it comes to accessibility. To look for a WG, check out wg-gesucht.de  The higher your language proficiency, the easier you make life for yourself. Do you absolutely need fluent German? Probably not. However, that said, you open so many more doors, especially when it comes to employment, once you become fluent in the language. Especially if you want to work in something related to politics or international relations, language proficiency will be extremely helpful. It'll be hard sometimes, because people will hear your accent when you speak and switch to English. If they want to practice their English, that's fine. You can let them speak in English, but insist on responding in German. This, I found, has been the best way to really find every opportunity you can to practice the language. You don't even need to say ""hey, I just want to practice German, so I'm gonna respond in German."" Just... respond in German right off the bat. That said, there are lots of NGOs and international government groups in Berlin, so it'll be easier to network within those fields and find related employment opportunities."
berlin,3e3kyp,token_canuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"And cost of food - how is that there? Utilities?   German is spoken without American/Canadian accent since I was initially raised a German-speaker.   Yea, NGO work could be a good idea. What sort of work did you do there mainly?"
berlin,3e3kyp,token_canuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"Food is cheap here especially if you shop at the discounter supper markets (Lidl, Aldi, Netto). However, you will not have access to as many choices (whether fresh produce or prepared meals) as in Canada, and produce tends to be a bit more seasonal. The Turkish/Asian supermarkets tend to have a wider variety of produce and cuts of meat (excluding pork, obviously) and often at the same price if not cheaper than the discounters. When I was a student, my grocery budget was around €25-30 per week, and I ate really well. If you want to dine out, the city is FILLED with restaurant/imbiss options within the €5-10 range. Obviously, there's also the döner sandwich for €3 options.  Most WG tend to include the utilities, heating and internet fees already. If not, internet is around €25/mo., and electricity is around €40/mo. for a flat of 50sqm. Since you're likely to be living in either a WG, you probably don't have to worry too much about this.  I am an architect, so I don't actually work in an NGO. However, a friend of mine worked in a sports NGO that ran football-related charity programs for kids in developing countries, and another friend of mine works as a domestic programmes coordinator for Save the Children, so there is definitely work out there at different scales. I know that the Save the Children office here in Berlin runs both domestic and international programmes, but as to the particulars of these positions and programmes, I don't have too much knowledge. What I do know is that their multilingual abilities helped (fluency in German + other languages) played a huge part in securing these positions for them."
berlin,3e3kyp,ausstieglinks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"Are Berlin apartments affordable? Or would it be better to live a bit outside of the city? I am a practical person so open to anything. Would love to hear thoughts from you folks who are familiar with this or had to face it yourself. :)   Depends.  My place right now is 440€ cold + 160€ heating.  In Canada it's called a one bedroom, but here it's called a zwei zimmer.  Compared to my place in SF of $3.600 it's free.  I one big street out of the Ringbahn.  Living in the ring is much pricier but more convenient.  A good way to save I suspect is to live just outside the ring, but nearish to transit.  I'm also from Canada (but lived in California for 5 years before here) and found that the grocery situation is kinda shitty.  Germans are always looking for a deal I find (and I admire that, really) but when it comes to food, they only seem to look at price.  Meat at the supermarkets is pretty awful, produce isn't great either.  Try to find a butcher and fruit shop for those and save the grocery stores for dry goods.  The transit here is also orders of magnitude better than Toronto (not sure where you're from) so make sure you consider your tranist trip before ruling out a place.  The only caveat is that the S-Bahn is less reliable in winter.  If you speak German, you should be mostly fine.  Just make sure that as soon as you have an address here that you register with the Bürgeramt  (Anmeldibestätigung iirc).  Without that document you can't do anything!"

berlin,3e3f75,burlybeetle,7,Tue Jul 21 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Doctor here. From what I understand, it's solely a communication problem. She isn't required to treat you in any case that's not a direct emergency. But if she refuses to treat you, she can't do that arbitrarily, rather needs a realistic reason (such as too many patients, lack of trust). Which brings us to the big question: What is it that you're seeking treatment for?  You wrote somewhere else:   It's unprofessional and downright dangerous.   How's that? Did she tell you why she couldn't give you an appointment? I don't see why this would be dangerous either (if it's not an emergency), given that one can always choose another doctor. From what I understand, there's already a diagnosis and you just need some new medication. If that's the case, see a general practitioner and get a prescription (strictly speaking, it could be any specialty, though it's best to see someone who is actually familiar with whatever disease you're seeking treatment for)."
berlin,3e3f75,jaZoo,6,Tue Jul 21 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"Is this the same doctor where you complained elsewhere (and even posted her name) that the doctor said she no longer wanted to treat you? If not, I'm seeing a pattern."

Are you sure they weren't on vacation and informed you (in German) about that with an automated message?  Did something else happen before that make you think that was deliberate?  In any case, the Ärztekammer (and if they are registered with public health insurance depending on what happened exactly the Kassenärztliche Vereinigung) is the relevant chamber to complain to if you want to. I would talk to the staff at the doctor before that though.  Edit: Here is information (in German) in how to do that. It is only possible in writing."
berlin,3e3f75,xqd,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't want to put too much information but here's how it went down: I called her to make an appointment. The phone number didn't even work for days and she wasn't answering emails. I finally got through and left a message. I left another message. 3 weeks later she contacted me, but at this point I had another appointment lined up so I told her I wasn't happy with her being in touch and was finding a new doctor. I couldn't make the appointment with the new doctor, which caused me to start the cycle again, calling and emailing her, an assistant called back, said she'd answer in a few days, then nothing. So she's had a history of this, this is not just that there was a mixup. It's unprofessional and downright dangerous.  Another post said that I can make the report in English?"
berlin,3e3f75,xqd,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"Am I right that you have not started treatment with her? While the experience indeed seems unpleasant, personally I don't think that complaint worthy. Many doctors, especially specialists, have very few available appointments and the times were you can call them is pretty restricted (e.g. some weekdays only before noon or similar). Additionally, Email is not a medium with which people communicate with doctors here. I don't think you can except a doctor (and not the receptionist) to make appointments on the phone, usually they have too many patients lined-up in person, so waiting a few days for that seems reasonable.  I don't know whether they accept English complaints but most likely they do. The address is given in the link. Note that for legal reasons they will not tell you what they made of your report."
berlin,3e3f75,xqd,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that I'm doing such a terrible job of explaining the situation, blah. That's why I'm worried about reporting it because I can barely describe it in english :(  I did see her, twice, and was able to get the medication prescribed to me, twice. She must know that I'm without it now. And when I talked about calling, I was calling the receptionist. I didn't have her direct contact info. Both times I have waited well over a few days, the first time it was 3 weeks.  Thanks. I will look into it more."
berlin,3e3f75,ChPech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"If you are reporting it (I don't know the situation so I can't advise whether you should do that) just try to list each and every interaction you had with her and her office in the complaint, which person(s) you talked to each time and describe the outcome/decisions (""decided with the doctor that I need to come back for a new prescription next month"", ""called for five days at different times but only an automatic message answered"", ""receptionist tells me that no appointment in the next few weeks is possible even though I made clear my prescription runs out""). This will help them to assess the situation. A list of the facts and simple language is probably a good idea. Make clear that this risks your treatment if that is the case (and only then)."

berlin,3dyg65,iliveinberlin,22,Tue Jul 21 07:38:17 2015 UTC,What I'm increasingly amazed at is the people who move here just because Berlin is cool. No interest in German. No interest in German culture. No interest in German history. Just craft beer and food markets and curated coffee and partying. After three months they learn about Tatort but it all stops there.
berlin,3dyg65,iliveinberlin,19,Mon Jul 20 16:59:33 2015 UTC,"Berlin sounds like a crazy collision of cultures but without the all the money/wealth that other EU big cities have.  Biking, good public transit, random food options, art, music, etc.  It's the same thing that would bring a German to San Francisco, Sydney, New York, Austin, etc.  They move there because they want to be in an eclectic and interesting city.  I haven't met any Europeans or Foreigners living in big cities in the US who said that they moved there to learn more about American culture and History.  If I were to move to India, I'd move to Mumbai to experience a crazy exciting vibrant big city and collision of cultures (both Indian and otherwise), and I'd make trips out into India to learn more about India (would go to places I haven't been yet)."

berlin,3dyg65,crabalab2002,5,Mon Jul 20 17:14:03 2015 UTC,I would disagree. Most Europeans I know living in NYC or San Fran are there at least partially to try to figure out what drives Americans and get a buzz from our anything-is-possible attitude (regardless of the realities). They can spout TV shows at least as well as we can and have a pretty good grasp of race history and relations.

Other (german) cities did not give me this enthousiasm. So no i am not interested in german culture, because i think every city has its own culture, and Berlins culture is the one that kept me interested. The openess of people, the internationality, the rich squating culture and the electronic music scene did it for me. Craft beer and food markets are a waste of money when there is sterni and falafel  To respond to OP's question: I wish i started comming here in the spring/summer instead of late autumn, because winter is really though, especially if you have to adjust to a new place, barely know people and are in the crazy flathunt game"

What I wish to have known is that, for cheap living in Mitte and underground partying over techno music, I came too late. The techno scene was already a lucrative, institutionalized industry and the rents inside of the Ring weren't affordable for me. And this didn't get better.  I'm still totally happy here, I pay a very nice rent in a very nice area (not gonna tell you which one because Gentrifizierung ;-)) and go to really nice parties, but it didn't turn out at all to be what I expected. Which on the other side is kind of why Berlin is great, because it's a city which takes a really long time to get to know and it's always surprising, partly because Berlin itself doesn't really know what it is.  In ten years I'm still going to be surprised (and I'll be laughing at what I thought Berlin was back in 2015). Sometimes it's exhausting, because everything is changing all the time, but mainly it's great.  So TL;DR Berlin is not going to be as you expected, but with some effort (inkl. learning German, getting to know Berliner, going to unexpected places with an open mind and doing something with your life) you're going to love it."

Contrary to popular opinion German is actually required in many places -- especially if you want something from the other people. Strikes can profoundly disturb your routines.

I have two work colleagues that don't speak German and they struggle with basic things. Ex. German postal service will just give some neighbour or shop your package if you are away. The notice they leave for you is unreadable. Try to get as much information as you can. I think Americans and Europeans underestimate the differences in lifestyle, culture, law and politics of each other. In Germany you'll probably have way more rights when it comes to renting a apartment, work security, wages, health insurance etc. Ex. in Germany there is a phenomenon called ""Mietnomaden"", people that don't pay rent and often destroy the apartment/house etc. Usually it takes 2+ years to get them out of the apartment. Be prepared for the winter. It can become really depressing, especially if you are partying too hard. Take opportunity of living in central Europe. Cool places and cities with a completely different vibe/culture are always just a few bucks and a couple of hours away. Learn how to shop. Germans love to save money and some are comparing prices like crazy. Dont ask me for drugs in a club ;) If your neighbours are open to it, try to befriend them. This will be unbelievable useful.

You log onto the web site at 9 am and keep hitting refresh that's when all the cancelled appointments for that day go up or something so you can grab yourself an appointment for that day.

The hardest thing for you might be getting a work visa, but you will never know if you don't try right? Good luck!

Finding rooms in ""in-districts"" is pure competition. Finding a flat on your own is even harder, you have to proof a job, or at least an income, often proof to be out of debt etc.. Dealing w/ energy, internet and extra costs can be quite difficult even with german as mothertounge. We love our beamtendeutsch.   If you are willing to move to cheaper places, off the citys hip-center you'll most likely find a different berlin than you'd expect, less competition and a more direct connection to locals and or fellow youngsters, who most likely are poor students your age from southern germany and therefore a great sport to explore the city, lifestyle, bars and people.   Obviously they do not need to be southern german. Chances are they might, though.  A bike is ideal for berlin, the BVG (puplic transport) is relativly expensive imo, but almost free at weekend peak hours (No one is going to ask for a ticket if the train is full of beer drinking party people.).  There is so much more.  Find a connection there to help you, a base is definitly pure gold.   Don't be afraid of the first winter. It is depressing and hard especially without many local contacts.  Beware of the second winter though.  That one is a bitch."
berlin,3e0ztp,PDXDUS,0,Tue Jul 21 05:32:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I've been living with 4 people in a relatively small flat for the past few years, so flat share is not an issue with me. I think this will be the most realistic option, especially now that you're mentioning the processes of being the sole tenant of a flat.  I'm not so concerned about living in the ""hippest"" boroughs, although it is important that I am close to the city centre, I want to be in the middle of everything. Wedding does look nice though.  Getting a bike will be one of the first things I do! Need to learn how to get around the city, and I don't mind spending the extra time to do so.  I do have a few friends, but I don't want to cling to them. I'm sure they can help though.  Australian summers are also a bitch, but I'm gonna assume Berlin winters are worse. Especially that second one. That bitch."
berlin,3e0ztp,NWmba,2,Tue Jul 21 05:52:36 2015 UTC,The actual australian winter in the moment is not the nicest one as well. But compared to a berlin summer its quite good. :)
berlin,3e0ztp,fs111_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:41 2015 UTC,"I think so.  I've had friends that did the WG thing and some it took less than a week to find one and others that it took over a month.  It depends on how picky you are and how dedicated you are to finding one. Check out http://www.wg-gesucht.de/ and you can start trying to get interviews lined up before you arrive (obviously only a few days before). My friend once complained that he sent out dozens of inquiries on that site and wasn't getting anything back, then he filled in his profile and added a picture and immediately started getting responses.  Do a bit more than everyone else, stand out and you should be fine.    Do watch out for the WG scams, there are plenty of them.  Sometimes they are easy to spot, like when they show pictures of a room with built-in closets (lol) or non-German style windows, you can tell they just pilfered them from an American website."
berlin,3e0ztp,NWmba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:28:51 2015 UTC,"Oh that's reassuring! Would have thought it would have taken a lot longer, I'll still allow myself plenty of time but will keep that in mind. I'll make sure I reverse image search advertisements but I'm sure as hell not paying anything until I've been to the place and spoken with the tenants haha"
berlin,3e0ztp,fs111_,2,Tue Jul 21 05:32:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the order I went through   Before leaving find place to stay that isn't a scam.  We found someone who was going to australia for a month through craigslist.  It was probably the only place on craigslist that wasn't a scam and you could tell because the rent was reasonable instead of insanely cheap.  Also they asked for money when we got there instead of via western union or to their lawyer.  Also they didn't call me sir and say they were pastors in Uganda and end the email with God Bless. Got off the plane, went to apartment, got a cold.  Of course we came in february. Anmeld. Go to the town hall with a copy of your lease.  If you are in a WG skip this step. Got bank account.  Most banks you need a job to get an account, but the Berliner Sparkasse takes anyone.  The catch was that they wanted an appointment.  Friggin' guy took 15 minutes to make an appointment for me for next week... with himself... and then the following week took 15 minutes to set up the account.  Oh germany. Take the form they give you as proof of anmelding.  (anmeldungsbestätigung).  If you don't have one because you're in a WG or temporary place, take a copy of your lease.  If you don't have one, take a copy of your friend's lease and tell them that you're staying there.  If they don't have one, take a copy of the craigslist ad that you found the place on.  But then, it's the sparkasse they probably wont give you a hard time. Get a Schufa.  It's a racket but you got no choice.  I mean, unless you're happy with a WG.  If you want your own place you need a credit check from SCHUFA and so you pay 20 bucks to get a membership for them to look you up and say ""Oh we have no data on you because you just moved here"".  Then you get a print out of that statement and show it to landlords when looking for your own permanent apartment.  THen you cancel the subscription because who wants a recurring subscription to a credit checking service? get a job (sha na na na) . Get your employer to write a letter saying that you have a job and it pays you X moneys.  Most landlords want 3 months of bank statements showing your income, but getting a letter from your employer can substitute for this. If you are a freelancer (journalist/english teacher/web designer/whatever) what you have to do is get letters from potential clients (the schools, businesses, or whatever you'd sell your services to) saying ""yes, Lachlansreddit is a dude providing this freelancing service and if he gets his visa and we have work available, I would consider paying him to do this service"" Get three or four.  Do this by just walking into companies or going to meetups and making friends with people at companies.  Make sure they're on company letterhead.  Companies will do them if they're worded in a non-binding way. Bribe a landlord.  When you look for a permanent apartment you'll be looking for ones that are provisionsfrei.  Most apartments are sold by agencies that charge like 2000 euros to give you a place.  They call it 'provision für mieter'. I call it extortion.  So you have a checkbox on immobilienscout and WG gesucht for only ""provisionsfrei"" apartments, which are not rented by the big agencies or mafiosi.  But these often have huge waiting lists. Most apartments will want you to buy their furniture so they don't have to move it.  Some of the apartments want you to buy their furniture even if they have none.  We call that a bribe.  You gotta do what you gotta do.  Now you have a real place.  Ummeld. It's like Anmelding but for moving. Or Anmeld.  Doesn't matter, same thing.  Go to the town hall with your lease and fill out a form. Don't forget to put your name on your post box so you can get mail. Get internet. I recommend going with either 1and1 or Deutsche Telekom.  Prepare to sit at home for the better part of the day on the day they are supposed to arrive.  Put a label by your front door bell saying ""DAS IST DER HAUS WO DU MUSST DIE INTERNET MACHEN"" or somethign to that effect.  If they are crosseyed and don't read your name properly they'll just leave and you have to wait another two weeks.  DSL internet comes with a phone line here. Make an appointment with the Ausländerbehörde.  You can do it online.  The wait can be like 2 or 3 months, so book it sooner rather than later.  Go down with every piece of paper they might want to see.  We made the mistake of only taking what they asked for on the website.  They are trying to answer the question of ""can this guy survive here without social assistance?""  So with your intermediate german, letter from employer, bank statement from a german bank that says you have enough euros for a little while, anmeldungsbestatigung saying you have an apartment, and any certifications you have ever had stating you're qualified to do your job, you should get a visa.   Bring money.  If you're applying for a freelance visa bring your letters you got in step six.  Also bring your portfolio and anything else relevant.   Congratulations, you are now German!"

berlin,3e0ztp,MrButlertron701,2,Tue Jul 21 07:07:06 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm just about to leave the life you're about to enter (hopefully).  I faced a lot of negativity here too, but I stuck it out, and I think things are about to finally turn around for me.  I think as an Australian, you're entitled to some things I was not, but before I go too in-depth, what specific visa are you looking to get?  Unrelated to that, I would say move into a WG first. Use wg-gesucht.de/en/ and it should go by pretty quick. I wouldn't be too picky, and it's usually pretty relaxed regarding official documents like sub-letter's agreements and the like. I moved into a WG and didn't have to sign anything at all, just pay my rent.  After you get an address, you have to anmelden. You could book an appointment, but that takes a month, sometimes longer, so wake yourself up early and go to any Bürgeramt and stand in line. I was there an hour before the doors open and had no problem taking a number. Just expect to wait a couple hours (and expect that constantly).  After you've got an address and a Anmeldungbestätigung, you can open up a bank account, of which is also very easy. I went with Sparkasse because I've heard good things and that was recommended to me. At Alexanderplatz, where I opened my account, it only took about an hour or so, and the the personnel that helped me were very nurturing and helpful, taking time to explain everything without being pushy or salesman-y. Highly recommended experience.  Depending on your visa, if you have health insurance from Australia, that might work. If not, expect to pay a lot here (that sounds scary, but it's just how it is here). Techniker Krankenkasse is apparently one of, if not the best public health insurance provider, so I went with them.  Phones should also be pretty simple. As long as your phone works globally, you can swap out the SIM from a discount grocery store. I, for example, have an international Galaxy Note 3 and simply went to LIDL here, bought a SIM card, and had a working phone. The biggest problem with it is that when you sign up, they'll want a bank account that they can draw monthly from. So, bank account from a friend that you can pay, or use your own.  After you've got all of that covered (bank account optional, unless your visa requires it), then start combing websites for jobs. I can point out a few if you'd like. Also, join LinkedIn and Xing.de, Xing being Germany's biggest professional social network. Also, if you can, starting establishing as many contacts with as many people as you can, since Vitamin B (for Beziehung) plays a big part here. I got a job offer because I randomly met the CEO of a company here at a birthday party. Like, can't stress that enough.  Tell me what visa you're going after so I can look at the documents you'd need. Also, the gay scene is not something I'm super familiar with, but I'm learning it slowly. From what I can tell, it's like most others, some genuinely nice people, some stuck-up, some that love foreigners, etc etc.   Also saw that you expect to be hated. Fuck the haters. Follow your dreams. You'll find good people here.   Lemme know how else I can help."

The stuff that you need to do like opening a bank account, etc sucks, but not much more than doing it in your own country. It is not traumatising, it's just a different way to spend a bit of your time. Everyone speaks about how emigrating is such a huge thing but it's really not, it's far easier than I ever thought it would be and I've been really shocked at it.   Adjusting to a new life is probably the ""hardest"", but if you like German culture (which is sounds like you do), especially more than your home county's, then it's exciting. If you're fine with leaving friends and family behind, you're golden. The internet makes communication much easier.   My tips are on the sanity side - find a great friend, speak German to cashiers and postmen to practise, when looking for an apartment go the extra mile (I wrote a page about us with a photo so that landlords would remember us and say no less easily), spend time exploring the city and country, find out about the German way of doing things.   You seem to be perfectly organised with saving money and your expectations. The number one thing Germans say when I tell them I'm trying to get citizenship is ""why"". They don't realise what they've got here, so that could be why you've seen some alternating reports about moving here. People also tend to speak unhappiness louder than happiness. This is the best country in the world and you're going to love it - even the hours spent doing admin."

berlin,3e0ztp,quaste,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:52:19 2015 UTC,"The first thing I did was get a ticket subscription for public transport. Right at the airport. Berlin has the best public transport in all of Germany, you can get from everywhere to everywhere 24/7 and it would be insane to pay as you go if you live here. Prizing is in the upper range of reasonable for Germany.  Getting a flat is somewhat challenging compared to other cities in Germany, not because there aren't any, but because the landlords scrutinize you thoroughly and there are usually a lot of applicants. Starting with a shared appartement is a good idea.   Getting a job in Berlin is easy. Getting a proper job, with decent salary and reasonable working conditions is not that easy. So prepare to switch a few times in the beginning until you get lucky.  And we had a some really hard winters a few years ago, but the last years, winters were quite mild."

I can't comment on the job situation as I was lucky and have the same job as before I moved here.  I am not a citizen and I had to register with the Bürgeramt to get my Anmeldibestätigung (spelling?).  With that document, I could get my Visa which was already organised at the Auslandersamt.  Once I had both of those, I went to Deutsche Bank on Freidrichstraße (Q107) where a nice man who spoke to me in English helped me set up all my banking.  Then I register with the Finanzamt where I set up my tax id.  My phone is from Blau.de and just a mobile.  If you have an unlocked cell, just buy a Blau.de sim card and put it in.  If not, the Moto E is cheap (~100€) and nice.  If you mean visa the credit card, don't bother for berlin, it's a cash-only city.  If you mean the immigration thing, depends where you're from as to whether you'll need to do it here or before you get here.  Flats are hard mainly because there is huge demand for cheaper places and not much supply.  Watch places, apply everywhere and hope!  I don't want to be a spoilsport, but for the visa I have, I had to have post-secondary education and a job offer in hand.  I'm sure there are other visas, but i'd look into this aspect asap.

I've been here for almost 5 years now, and two winters ago, it really started to hit me how depressing winters in Berlin are. However, I found that keeping yourself busy helps to take your mind off the weather. I try to find some exhibitions or events to go to at least once a week.

As /u/token_canuck said, it is definitely important to stay busy and most important - physically active. It is tempting to stay inside to wait for months for when finally that first warm sunny day arrives, but this way your winter will last a lot longer in your perception. Go outside anyway, take a bike instead of the U-Bahn, and if you really can't stand the cold I'd suggest to start going to a gym, even if it's just for half an hour of running or cycling a few times a week.

Finally, and this might sound strange, I tried fasting (500 calories a day, basically I just drank a lot of tea and then had a snack and small dinner) two days a week last fall/winter and I found I had much more energy.   Basically, I think SAD is a natural reaction to the winter and makes us want to hibernate (i.e. eat and sleep all day), so doing something rather extreme (i.e running 10 miles, fasting) can work as a way of convincing your body that it's not time for hibernation."
