This society works.  Number 7 hits too close to home regarding maternity leave. My life got 20 weeks, because her company was generous. The midwife visits was a blessing as we didn't really know how to do things properly. The best was the hospital stay though. We had a private room I could stay overnight with my wife and newborn in the room. Food (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) were all covered. It was like a all-inclusive vacation! All covered by the insurance (I admit, we have supplementary coverage through the company). All I had to pay for was overnight parking for 4 days though: 9 CHF / day.  Number 6 is almost true - there are still many places in CH that a car would be very practical. But if you don't have children or have ample time, all you need is a GA (subscription for unlimited public transportation for about 300 CHF/month)."
IWantOut,3e3u8c,AsianSteleotype,7,Tue Jul 21 21:02:01 2015 UTC,"Read the article, everything she points out makes me sad. I'm really curious about the public transportation bit, though. I fully agree the suburbs are awful for this and need to be improved, but a city like Chicago (where I lived for 5+ years) has amazing public transit. I'm nearly 30 and I've never owned a car in my life. On top of this, the US is huge. I'd want to understand the actual distance comparison she's describing. My folks live in the west suburbs of Chicago and to visit them by train it'd take me at least an hour. If we improved our rail system this time could easily be halved, I'll confess. But I also was able to continue to be car- and plane-free in taking trains to Seattle and LA from Chicago. Again, the US is huge so those train rides took me 2 days, but it was possible.  If you don't want to own a car, you need to live in a major city, not near it."

Especially true for Zürich and Geneva. French/German are definitely necessary though for administrative work and whatnot. However, there are so many professional services that can help with the process.  Also: They don't colloquially speak high German. The Swiss German dialect is like another language on its own."
IWantOut,3e3u8c,AsianSteleotype,3,Tue Jul 21 21:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm taking French lessons now and while it's going slowly I'm definitely making progress. It helps that I took Spanish all through school so I understand the concept of conjugation and male/female words.   The best way is honestly immersion. If you can't go to the country itself, create playlists of music in the language of choice and watch movies in it, too. It's annoying not being able to understand anything but it'll go much faster.  When I went to Costa Rica, even only for a week, all my Spanish came back to me and I was perfectly conversational with most people. So it's possible, but I think you need to convince your brain to ""unlock"" it, like ""this is the situation we're in and the only way to survive is to speak this new language."""
IWantOut,3e3u8c,Zelaphas,2,Tue Jul 21 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you can find classes, take them. After a couple years, start watching movies in the language with subtitles on (in the same language), with the English subtitles pulled up as well to reference when you're confused. That helps a lot, for me at least.  Also, if you can travel and practice with native speakers, it helps, a LOT. And read. Lots of reading. My fourth year of French class was an independent study and the majority was reading out of the French textbook (in French).  When I went to France, I was able to speak to all the locals in French without much difficulty. It helps to have Google Translate on your phone for noun look ups. (It sucks depending on the phrase, but for nouns it's pretty accurate in my experience).  Another thing I do is as I go through my day, whenever I say something I try to think in my head how to say it in French. If I don't know, I look it up. I've gotten to the point where many times I will think things in French without meaning to.  TL;DR: Immersion."

It's as if people didn't realize that you drive 1 hour in one direction and you've left the country.    It should be obvious that some tiny enclaves manage to create massive wealth for their tiny countries, usually by specializing in something.  Switzerland actually used to be the wealthiest country in Europe by a wide margin (GPD per capita) and how do you think that happened?  They cut a deal with the Nazis, as a ""neutral"" country, that's how.  It's ironic that the writer points out how much taxes rich people pay in the USA, but completely forgets that Switzerland has historically been the place where criminals and tax evaders hide money with their anonymous bank accounts.  And yes, I know people who used to live in Switzerland.  Not having a car is not ""freeing.""  The reason why fewer Swiss have a car and much fewer Swiss actually manage to own a home is because everything is damn expensive. Food, cars, houses, anything you could possibly want is going to cost you an arm and a leg.  Incomes are high, but so are the expenses.  You can put a positive spin on not owning a car and how ""freeing"" it is, but I wonder if the author can be so enthusiastic about Swiss having one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe.  The young people I know from Switzerland do not even imagine owning a house in their future given the prices.  All that said, Switzerland has been ahead of the curve for about 2 centuries and created a very interesting environment that is very welcoming to the rich and to business.  Their business regulations are the envy of every market capitalist in the USA.  Their legislative undertakings are systematically very forward thinking and strategic.

You basically need to find a researcher/professor willing to be your supervisor and a company willing to pay you to do the research. I haven't done this, but I knew people who did (one of them was Mexican, actually).  Most CS researchers would speak English, so language is less of an issue with this than with many other migration paths.  Doing a PhD in France would get you a ""scientist"" (scientifique-chercheur) residence permit, which is nice, because it counts towards permanent residence and citizenship, unlike a student RP. When you finish your 3-year PhD you'd only have to stay on as a post-doc researcher for another 2 years to get PR (or get another job, if you prefer). In fact, you'd be eligible to apply for citizenship as soon as you get your PhD (though there is no guarantee of success - it's discretionary).  I have no idea about the PhDs or work in Education. That might be much tougher than CS. However, if the one with the CS background can get either a ""worker"" or a ""scientist"" RP their spouse and child could get a family reunification RP (vie privée et familiale). This authorises them to work (well, maybe not the 1 year old). However, you may have to be in France for 18 months before you can apply for family reunification. I'm not very clear on this, so that would be something to check with French authorities. The first link makes it sounds like the family can come with you straight away.  As for health care, don't worry about that - if you have a residence permit you'll be registered in the public health care system in France."

I've heard that this is due to the way media represents Norway in their home country (heard this about Spain anyway).  And also to answer no. 3: I dunno about ""most"", but I believe many immigrants certainly do end up disillusioned and leave back to their home country, but not before spending a crapton of money on living expenses in Norway. This is especially true for people from southern EU who are unaware of the 6 month jobseeking rule or that it's actually hard to find work if you don't speak fluent Norwegian."

The UK had more pro-human functioning systems, but it also had a lot of issues (the most notable one being that if you're an EU citizen, you have access to a lot of things and lower costs, whereas if you're not, you're much more limited).

When workers from Turkey came to Germany back in the 60s and 70s  uneducated people could still do the work in factories and earn good money. Nowadays there are almost no jobs left that do not require higher education. So people with low education will face the same problems low class Germans face: Unemployment. On the other hand the definition of success is relative and immigrants that make some money of a shitty job here can feel way better than back home.  Cannot answer this question properly, too vague.

This may sound weird but honestly your best bet would be to move to a different EU country and apply for your family member visa there.

This is because the rules are a lot more relaxed when it comes to moving to a different EU than where your partner is from.  czech immigration website  If you click the link above you'll see that you don't need to be in a relationship like being married to get the visa. You just have to prove to the government that you have been together. I did this by first moving in with my girlfriend to the Czech Republic and then my landlord filled out a form saying that we lived together. Then we gave them a ton of pictures of us from the past 2 years, which included us in America, us in France, us everywhere.   If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.

Was it the temporary residence?  How were you able to rent a place in Czech republic before becoming a resident? Didn't the landlord want to know you were a EU citizen before letting you sign? Does it still have to be 2 years together to qualify? How long does it last?    Thanks so sososo much for any advice you can give mate.

I can work and live in any country in the EU (except the UK) as long as my girlfriend is registered to live there. For an EU citizen it literally takes just a morning of going to the office in your target country and having them fill in some easy paperwork. I got the temporary residence. It lasts for 5 years and I can renew it afterwords or just become a permanent residence of the czech republic. Well You can be in Europe for 3 months on your tourist visa. Just have your girlfriend with you when your finding your place together and just request that they put your name on the lease. I did this with no problem. It is supposed to be 2 years that your together but to be honest, it would be really easy to fake it. I only provided them with photos from the past 2 years together. I guess it would be impossible for them to check the dates on the photos.  I also provided them with a notarized letter for my girlfriends parents saying that they knew we were together. If you really want to make sure they know you are together you could give them bank statements with both of your names on this  but I didn't do this. As stated above it lasts for 5 years.

With her EU citizenship, you could however just show up and live together in a different EU country as spouses (or unmarried cohabitees in certain countries). It's a shame for you, because Denmark is pretty awesome.    Here is what I would do if I were in your situation and could afford it.. Marry your girlfriend, get a cheap apartment in Malmö/Lund and register yourselves in Sweden (not sure what you two do for work? you can use either the Nordic citizen rules or the EU rules)(http://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-citizens-and-long-term-residents/Nordic-citizen/Permits-for-family-members.html)(http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/documents-formalities/non-eu-family-members-residence-card/index_en.htm), get a second apartment in Copenhagen and live and work there but return at least 1x/week to Sweden in order to keep your residency (http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/cross-border-commuters/index_en.htm).    After she's living in Sweden for 2 years, she can get the Swedish citizenship. Then after 3 more years you can too! It'll be 6 years minimum in Denmark (once you're in) as a spouse of Danish citizen.

You can basically otherwise go anywhere in Sweden or to any other EU country as a cohabiting partner (however be aware that different countries may have different requirements to actually prove 18 months together, so make sure you gather all the proof you can that you were actually living together in these other countries, I think that's your main risk here. Especially if you were ""residing in"" various EU countries without ever having actual residency).  The problem is that your girlfriend will need to sponsor your residency, and to do that she will basically need a job that's deemed enough to support you first.  Perhaps it's easiest for her to find something in Copenhagen, in which case you'd have to commute from Malmö or else you'd be subject to Danish family member residency rules.  Perhaps there are special Nordic rules (your girlfriend can live anywhere in any of the Nordic countries including Norway and Iceland without even registering residency) that could get around this somewhat but that'd take some more serious research."

You can try to qualify as an unmarried couple, but you generally need 1-2 years of living together in a stable way before that will be approved (http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/family/couple/de-facto-unions/index_en.htm). Doubtful that full time travelling would qualify, but you could give it a try!    No border control between any of the Schengen countries. There's a train (38 mins) between Malmö C and København H which is also pretty cheap (9$ each way). You can also take a ferry or do what I do (sail my boat over). As long as you have some record (receipt, GPS log, etc) it's all good. Bonus is that you can also keep a car registered in Sweden (and avoid the 180% Danish car tax).    One thing I actually didn't consider- can you qualify for a work permit in DK on your own? Such as the ""greencard scheme""? http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/work/greencard-scheme/ Check if you have enough points.

You'd need a decent command of French for this. There are also courses taught entirely in English, though the choice is much more limited, obviously.

The minimum salary for a Tier 2 visa will also rise from £18.5k to £35k, making one significantly harder to obtain."
IWantOut,3dxuoz,fyijesuisunchat,5,Mon Jul 20 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"That is not correct. The requirement to return and apply from the home country applies to college (further education) students only - - not that it's possible on reality for college students to get sponsorship for work anyway.  The threshold of £35k applies for those who want to apply for permanent residency from the Tier 2 visa.   However, it's still very hard for Tier 4 students to get work sponsorship for the Tier 2. In 2014, 5,639 students were granted leave to stay in the UK under Tier 2. The equivalent figure for 2013 was 4,175. Keep in mind that there's around 150k of foreign students who come on the Tier 4 visa each year, so you can compute the odds yourself. It isn't great."

However, I've also heard that employers need to allow time for EU nationals to apply before hiring a non-EU person.   This is called the Resident Labour Market Test, and currently, Tier 4 visa holders are exempt from it. Once your Tier 4 expires and you're once again subject to the RMLT, it will be much more difficult to find an employer who can/will sponsor your Tier 2 visa; you'll be at square one with no advantage over any other non-EU applicants.   Your MA programme will keep you in the UK temporarily, but you should find sponsored employment ASAP if you wish to settle. Do be aware that Tier 2 visa holders are currently the biggest target for immigration culls, so you are probably going to see raises in minimum salary requirements in order to maintain a Tier 2 visa. Stay on top of immigration laws because they change frequently and with little notice. Not an easy life, but if an employer wants you badly enough, they'll help you meet the minimum salary."

Congrats :)   More or less in the same place as you, only a couple of months ahead, and leaving a different country behind (France).   So, from your post I gather that you will be going to Canada alone? What's your long term plan there (work a lot and try to get a stable situation, or a ""true"" WHV where you'll get some odd job here and there while you visit as much of the country as possible)? If you intend to stay in a specific city, which one?"
IWantOut,3dwqfb,Asshai,2,Mon Jul 20 09:30:59 2015 UTC,"Yea I got my POE letter a few days ago, literally the next morning after I just agreed to a fortnight worth of work (Events).   Well at this stage I am still torn between where I want to go I like the idea of a larger city like Toronto which is probably sitting in first place, but just about everybody I have spoken to has nothing but good things to say about Vancouver and BC. My original plan was to try and get into a stable position and look at the possibility of possibly emigrating eventually but I feel like that will depend on how much I enjoy the place. At the end of the day I am moving from the tropics where our coldest days of winter are on par with Canada's average summer temps."
IWantOut,3dwqfb,Asshai,2,Mon Jul 20 10:07:18 2015 UTC,"When I first thought about moving to Canada, I did a huge post comparing the three largest canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver).   Basically, they're all great.   Toronto is the largest, and catches up with Montreal on the cultural life. It suffers from poor public transportation, if you don't intend to purchase a car right away it may be an issue (basically, their monthly pass is outrageously overpriced for a subway that's too underdevelopped for a city of this size).   Montreal is the second largest, and has a European vibe that seems to appeal to a lot of people, and is a very dynamic city, culturally speaking. Oh and the rents are much cheaper than in the two other cities (but when looking at your oeverall monthly budget, Toronto has cheaper food, so it tends to even things out). Main drawback is that speaking French is strongly advised.   Vancouver's main drawback for me is probably an advantage for you: it's on the West coast. Which means a shorter and cheaper trip back home for you. Vancouver, like Seattle, tends to attract start-ups and people who enjoy an alternative lifestyle. It is, however and by far, the most expensive city to live in out of the three compared here. Especially because of the rents. Don't know how the situation is in Australia, but keep in mind that when you'll first arrive in Canada, you'll have no job yet, and convincing a landlord to accept you may be a bit harder in a city where demand far exceeds the offer.   Hope that helped, now if you're interested I can write something about my ""to-do list"" and main priorities prior to our departure!"

I haven't really considered Montreal on account I don't speak French and have heard it can be pretty rough if you don't speak French in the French speaking areas but I would really like to visit.   I am leaning towards Toronto I just feel like I will have a better time there as i'm not necessarily looking for a ski/boarding resort holiday job like a lot of people from Australia tend to. The fact the have a public transport system that offers alternatives to traditional taxis or buses that run late 50% of the time will be an upgrade in my opinion.  That would be really nice if you could share your ""to-do list"" and see what things you have considered that I may not have."
IWantOut,3dwqfb,Asshai,2,Mon Jul 20 11:43:14 2015 UTC,"OK, here goes:   Get your plane ticket ASAP, the sooner the cheaper. Can't help much about the airline, we booked on Air Canada, a lot of people get a round trip with a flexible date on the return trip, but that costs more of course. If there's some Australian website about the WHV see if there's some kind of partnership with an airline (and an insurance company, more on that below): I know that through pvtistes.net (French website) you get an additionnal free 10 lbs on luggage if you book your flight on Air Transat (which also would have been cheaper if we didn't have to travel with a cat!).  Giving your notice at work and for your current home will also be one of your main priorities, can't help you much here either, as I don't know anything about Australian laws, but: in these two cases, it's important to maintain a good relationship with your landlord so that he writes you a recommendation letter (at least in Québec there's no security deposit, so landlords have to be that much more careful about who they rent their place to), and your employer so that you can use him as a reference for your future job. Get an international driving licence, the whole process was surprisingly quick (knowing the French administrative system, it was a miracle) and free. Whether you intend on purchasing a car there or not, at least you're covered on that side, even if only to rent some pick-up truck to bring some Ikea furniture back to your new place! Medical checkup. See if Canada is more generous than Australia, of if your current healthcare provides better benefits, and if it does, do what is necessary right now, so you save some money during your journey. Get a WHV insurance policy. That's what I'm working on right now, it seems that only a few insurance companies have a policy regarding the WHV (especially now that it's been extended to 2 years). Plus, the companies that do require you to pay upfront. Know that it is mandatory, that it will be asked by the customs at your arrival, and that the duration of your policy will limit the duration of your WHV. On that part too, if there's an Australian website that deals with the WHV, they may have a partnership with some insurance company and offer a discount. Money! you'll have to open an account at a Canadian bank, but can't close your Australian account. However, you should do your best to find right now an Australian bank that has a partnership with a Canadian bank. I have a meeting with my banker this week to discuss that, apparently there's something called Global Alliance that links several banking corporations together, and remove the fees on international transactions. Pretty neat, and could provide substantial savings. You can also keep using your current credit card there, as there will be no fee on standard banking operations either. And on that area, contrary to the insurance and airline, I can be of some help: I saw that an Australian bank is included in that Global Alliance partnership, and it is Westpac.  Be sure to unlock your phone so you can switch to a Canadian provider. See if your current phone company offers better deals than the Canadian ones, if they do change your phone now.  You should probably start looking for a place to rent, just so you get a rough idea of how much you'll pay. /r/toronto should be a good place to start looking, they'll probably advise you to search using kijiji.ca, craigslist, and padmapper.com.  Likewise, you can update your resume, in every country the employers like to see the resumes ordered differently, but the difference is probably small.  Hope you can get a place to stock your belongings, for me it's a huge hassle, we're selling or giving most of it, but there are things that I like and won't fit in any luggage, so there's the whole issue of what do we take with us, what do we sell, what can be sent later and how will we do this. Still not sorted out. Be sure to have things sorted out on an administrative level, and with the Australian authorities. Taxes, healthcare, post office, insurance, let them know you'll be abroad to prevent any bad surprises. You may want to redirect your mail to some relatives' adress. When arriving in Canada, you'll need to show them: your passport, your POE letter, a bank statement that's less than 1 week old proving that you have the required funds (I guess you probably know about all that), and some document from the insurance company proving  that you subscribed for the whole duration of your stay. If I were you, I wouldn't trust the airline enough to put these documents in the cargo hold, keep them with you, and also make a copy of them, and all other important documents, on a... USB drive, that you keep on you at all times. Other than the required documents for the customs, you may want to have a copy of any an all important documents relating to the Australian authorities, in case there's any kind of trouble, and any document that will help you in Canada (copy of the recommendation letter of your previous landlord, and of course your resume).   That's it! Hope it can be of some use to you, and in the same way if you think of something important that's not in it, let me know!"

I spoke very little Spanish when I came (still do really) and I think it is possible to get by in terms of buying groceries, ordering coffee etc. however, I am studying in English so that is one major complication I avoided, and I was lucky enough to make some bilingual friends at the hostel and we found a place to live together, so again avoided the complication of finding a flat without speaking spanish, having said that there where some landlords etc who spoke english, so not impossible but not easy.   I will make a difference where in Spain you go, the level of english in Madrid and Barcelona is a lot better than where I live (Murcia).  Anyway long and short of it, you won't die without speaking Spanish but I wouldn't expect to make a lot of friends or eat out at restaurants anywhere other than the major cities. also just a personal thing I feel like an asshole visiting a country and then making people speak english so you should try to learn (duolingo is great just FYI)  other than language the other problem will be money, it will be almost impossible for you to get a job, IIRC unemployment is around 50% for u25s and 30% overall. plus visas etc make it difficult (again depends where you are from). The good news is Spain is very cheap (at least for me coming from Australia) it was very easy to save enough money to live for a year.

But yeah, of course there is also massive unemployment there, so for certain areas finding a job would be more tricky.  The language is also area-dependent. In a place like Barcelona you would probably be fine with just English. Mind you that those guys actually speak Catalan. Other cities might be tricky. I don't think major cities in Spain have as many expats living there, compared to places like Amsterdam or Berlin. High level of Spanish often shows up as a requirement in job listings.  Also, mind you that the salaries in Spain are generally lower than in similarly developed countries to the north. So your general income would be a bit lower.

IWantOut,3duo64,pyridine,2,Tue Jul 21 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty extreme culture shock - much more than you would expect from the outset.  Definitely read up on jantelov as that's a big part of it.  It's also not about harsher climate, as overall the temperature highs and lows are much more mild.  It's about level of darkness.  Even Copenhagen is far to the north of e.g. Vancouver and it seems the difference in daylight hours and quality of said daylight is non-linear as you go north.  It's even cloudier than Seattle and Vancouver - check a map with average number of sunshine hours if you don't believe me.  It's also colder on average in the summer.  This year it's been quite cold, although this is not terribly uncommon (and there are long stretches of this pretty much every summer, it's just been ALL summer except for 2 days this year) - it's been in the 50s here in Denmark nearly continuously since the beginning of May with rain basically every day, so I'd say it can be very much worse than a Pacific Northwest summer.  In for example Bergen, Norway, the temperatures were hovering at or below 50F for most of June and have only recently crept up to around 59F as daily highs - in mid-July.    I also find it very difficult to deal with availability of e.g. groceries and other stuff here.  Supermarkets are just a dreadful affair here and I actually take photos in glee in the supermarkets when I go back to the US on vacation.  Basically just these crowded little shops with little choice in anything and total unavailability of a lot of ingredients that are taken for granted in the US.  It only works out if you learn to cook like the locals (mmm, pig liver paté day in and day out on rugbrød anyone? or would you prefer mackerel paste?).  While many prices are within reason so long as you earn a local salary, the prices for so many random things are just absolutely outrageous."

I like trying new things so local ways of cooking is something I look forward to.   The weather and darkness sounds divine, though. I am one of those people who like cold dark and dreary.  I have already decided to plan our scouting visits for winter."
IWantOut,3duo64,pyridine,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"Produce is of course available, and certain things are cheaper than in the US (basic bags of onions, potatoes, carrots etc) but most very particular things you'd be looking for in your recipes are more expensive.  Where the US gets its produce from California and Florida or somewhere in Latin America in the winter, northern Europe gets most produce from mega-agriculture in Spain, Italy, Turkey, Morocco etc.  As in the US, only the seasonal produce is affordable, and seasonable basically just means root and Brassica vegetables up here at any time of year.  The thing is, at least in Denmark which has a grocery oligopoly from 2 or 3 companies that basically control all prices and supply (hopefully it's better in the other countries heh?), you have these different tiers of grocery stores owned by the same company.  So there's the ludicrously expensive, the slightly less expensive, and the ""discount"" store.  Anyone trying to be frugal buys whatever they can from the discount stores (it's literally half the price of the non-discount for many basic items), but they usually run out of stuff and you never know what vegetables you'll find.  Like sometimes you go in there on a weekday evening and there's nothing but grapefruit and parsley left, and I can never be sure I'll find something ""exotic"" like zucchini or eggplant in these discount places.  There are definitely fewer types of vegetables available than in the US, and well some that are commonly eaten here that aren't so much in the US like beets and Jerusalem artichokes.  You can sometimes find some missing stuff at ethnic grocers (where I've just given into paying $10 for a pound of sweet potatoes...screw it) but you generally have to be conveniently located in the downtown area of large city for it to be practical to find on a daily basis.  And my supplies of fresh cilantro are highly unpredictable so I never know when I can actually find it to cook something requiring it.  The problem is that most of the ethnic food stores are run by Turks and the ingredients found in them are mainly middle eastern.    I was actually sorta a vegetarian before I moved here (still ate dairy, eggs, fish also...meat basically a few times/year on average).  But I gave it up moving here simply because a lot of the vegetarian options that I had in the US vanished and it was just too annoying to deal with since I'm not really a fanatic about being a vegetarian.  I couldn't even find tofu for a couple years, and there are almost no beans readily available.  I've found tofu sometimes now but it's not the firmness that you'd cook with - it's only the really soft stuff like what's in miso soup so I can't do much anything with that.  However I did and still do work pretty long hours so a lot of that is due to the lack of vegetarian options in terms of pre-prepared foods (in the US I'd just load up on Trader Joe's stuff and would eat out 1-2 times per week...if you like eating out at restaurants, ugh they can just be awful here, and the price makes me weep).    They eat more meat in Denmark and probably much higher amounts on average in all the Scandinavian countries than anywhere else on Earth, even despite its very high cost.  You can't even get all types of meat here - for instance finding turkey is very rare.  In Denmark, everything is all about pork and pig products.  There are 5X as many pigs in Denmark as humans so it's a huge industry and it's the cheapest meat, followed by beef/chicken which are about equally expensive.  This sucks for me because it's not in my culture to eat pork so it's not something I ever prefer to cook at home.  The national dish is stegte flæsk which is pretty representative of what the cuisine is here.  And the availability of fresh fish leaves a lot to be desired.  To most peoples' surprise, fresh seafood is simply not really a part of Nordic cuisine unless you're a fisherman.  Seafood in Nordic cuisine is finding a way to preserve fish for long periods of time by whatever means possible - which means smoked fish, pickled fish (both of which I happen to love because they're also eaten frequently in my culture), canned fish (skippers etc), lutefisk (preserving in lye - fortunately not really consumed much anymore), out to the extreme grossness of fermented pickled fish (surströmming...it's basically rotten) and some of the god-knows-what-they-do in Iceland.  The main way whole fish fillets are consumed is by coating in bread crumbs and pan-frying, eaten with remoulade (which I also really like).  Even in the fishing villages, you see them hanging fish to dry in the early Spring, which is another form of sort of open air rotting since fish don't really dry in the air here.  They have to stop by late Spring or else you get too many maggots in it.  The common form of shrimp you'll find are the tiny ones, frozen cooked or pre-cooked and packed in containers with water, mostly fished from Greenland.  Mussels are available and fairly cheap, at least frozen ones.  So yeah that's it for seafood and meat.    As long as you're prepared for a big change with this, and you're up for new stuff, I think you'll be fine.  But after a few months, man you'll start craving American foods that you hardly even ate in the US, it's kinda weird (you'll see many expats say this).  I still mourn for what I've lost from the US though, although it does grow weaker with each passing year, and I feel like every time I go back to visit I have to make a food schedule so I can eat everything I've missed before I leave!  And then I try to prolong my misery by packing my suitcase full of non-spoilable foods that I can eat for another week or two once I'm back.  But from my state of deprivation I'm just starting to get to the point now where if I ever return to the US, there will be a few foods that I miss from here, a tiny little bit."

If he's in a place where he really can't and won't help you even for a few months, OK - forget him, consider some other things.  Is there someone at school that could help you just for a few months? Or at your church/temple/etc, if you are at all tied to a religion ? A local group that helps women and/or children in trouble? Or a distant relative, parent of a friend, friend of your parents, etc? Even some random NGO or helpful organization? It seems like your biggest hurdle right now is filing in the time until you're 18, and finding a safe place to live just until you finish secondary school and become legally  independent, with a lot more options.

The program that I am currently enrolled in is not a terminal masters program, but a PhD program.  It is expected that I will continue on with the PhD here.  While I do know people who have left after the Master's degree because the PhD simply wasn't for them, it may be more difficult for me to leave in order to pursue a PhD elsewhere.  I am not certain that my project advisor would be willing to write me a positive letter of recommendation after leaving unless I was doing a complete career change and thus HAD to leave this program to pursue my PhD elsewhere.    Additionally, if I do leave with my Master's, I'm not certain I would want to continue on to a PhD, as my current masters only qualifies me for a very limited amount of PhD subjects.  It is a very specific field.  And I am worried I may have completely screwed myself over."

Many people arrange this with a particular professor in advance, although things always depend on funding, so you can really up your chances if you can apply for your own postdoctoral fellowship (esp. check Marie Curie fellowships) and bring your own funding with you.  You may still be able to get a postdoc by just applying to ads as well (which is what I did, but I'm in a more applied hard science field so competition is probably quite a lot lower than in your field).  Academia will be the absolute easiest path over, since they're more accustomed to hiring from abroad than basically any other employer.

First of all find out what your father's birth certificate says regarding your grandfather. Then try to find out whether your grandfather ever naturalized in Peru. And also I would need to know the year your father was born and got married and whether he did any military service in Peru.  Regardless, as the granddaughter of a Spanish citizen, even if you aren't already one you have certain benefits such as: the ability to get a work permit for any job offer (normally a foreigner has to prove that no Spanish or EU citizen could do it, but as a granddaughter that doesn't apply to you), and also the possibility of naturalizing after 1 year of residence.

If so (and assuming all the information regarding your grandpa is correct on your dad's birth certificate) you might want to tell her to get it certified (with Apostille) as well.

However, if he didn't then there's not much point in looking for his birth certificate because it looks like, otherwise, Spain only gives citizenship to the children of those who are Spanish born/citizens.  Check this out, though, don't just take people's word from reddit.  Also check what your Peruvian citizenship can do for you.    Studying in Spain seems a good idea. You'll need funding (check out if you could get US federal loans) you can work part time but it's not supposed to cover all your living expenses. You apply for the course and then the visa.  Do you have any links to EU countries? Italy and Ireland are the best countries because they do allow citizenship through grandparents. I have heard of US citizens going over to Spain and making a living from teaching English. This is obviously not a legal move as presumably they're overstaying on tourist visas and I'm not sure what will happen to them in the long term (whether they'll get deported and banned or whether it is possible that there's some way of turning illegal living into long term residency?) but I wouldn't recommend this.

They worked it out where there's less paperwork & bureaucracy involved. That's what they're ranking. The ease of traveling to those countries. Canada probably just hasn't gotten around to those other three countries to work out deal with them yet, or hasn't felt the need too. Usually there's bargaining involved where Canada has to reciprocate the policy and maybe they don't want too.  When traveling to some countries, you have to get pre-approved ahead of time. Which involves traveling to the destination countries' embassy in your country and applying, going through a thorough background check, and then waiting weeks. Where maybe someone from the UK or the US can just hop on a plane and have that all taken care of in 5 minutes as they go through customs.   That's what they're ranking. So it's really no surprise the U.S and U.K rank 1st since they're more economically and/or politically robust. Despite there being anti-american sentiment on reddit, most countries' governments love America because America mean money and power. Even if it wasn't for that, American & UK tourists are generally well behaved (relatively speaking, they're not going to take a poop in the middle of the street) and will usually drop loads of cash.

Then I entered France with this visa and they stamped my passport. Once I was in the country and had gotten a bank account and a place to live (temporary housing provided by the company), I had to apply for a residence card. I also spent time looking for more permanent housing, an apartment that I would pay for.

Having a solid job in Norway would very likely mean that you already qualify. If they changed any of these rules, it is unlikely that they would change it retroactively for those who were already approved under the old rules.  And even if Norway collapses and turns into some version of Belarus, you'll still be fluent enough in Norwegian to take a job in Sweden or Denmark, where people will understand you, and you'll understand them and their culture. Sweden also allows non-EEA citizens to work in Sweden and get a residence permit.  The Norwegian-Swedish border is extremely porous, basically just forest and mountains without fences, so even if they try to hunt you down for being European you'll still be able to get out by just walking past the border. They don't have the resources to patrol it, and if they start building some sort of fence you'll have enough time to leave beforehand.  And if this collapse doesn't happen within the first seven years of you living there, you'll qualify for Norwegian citizenship. So I wouldn't worry about it."

The recent downturn in Norwegian economy and downsizing of the oil industry hasn't really helped to make him feel more secure either.  If you do fall in love with Norway though and want to spend the rest of your days here, then after 7 years and jumping through a few hoops (stable job, learning Norwegian, no criminal record, no living on social support etc.), you will have the option to acquire Norwegian citizenship, but it will require you to give up your British one.

Sometimes I get it, but sometimes it comes off as romanticising or ""fetishizising"" an idea or notion of British culture and, in those occasions, I don't think they understand life is very much the same wherever you are. Same shit, different postal code.  There are also a lot of people attracted by the NHS and social services here; mostly those in America or other countries without socialised medical care who need access to those services. A lot of people find the welfare benefits here very attractive, either because they support or need them. On that, I personally find it bizarre when people with mental health want to move here for access to NHS as it is exceptionally mismanaged and poorly dealt with.   Now, the whole ""like home"" thing. The UK is an excellent hub for further culture. You can fly around the world, to a plethora of European, Western Asian and African nations in scant hours. Even within the UK there is a wealth of history and grandeur, from visiting Stratford to see the old Bard's home to visiting castles, stone circles or stately homes that inspired some of the most beloved literature in the world. UK history travels from the Celts to the modern and many people find this exciting, thrilling and interesting. You're never far from a museum, exhibition or cultural site in the UK.  Then, there's the opportunity. London is gobbling it all up, sure, but people can make it here. It's a bit like New York. London has the same allure, I think. It's a little more reserved, but if you feel like your home capital ain't cutting it for you, London offers a hodgepodge of cultures, a heap of opportunity and jobs and a chance to earn a great salary. This is enticing, especially, to members of the EU. They can travel home quickly with a currency worth more, typically, than their own. London, and the rest of the UK in areas, is very attractive as a place to spend a few years saving or building your CV, especially as the youth unemployment has been high in member states like Spain, Portugal and Italy.  There are groups, events and activities for anyone, of any creed, with any desire. You can find someone, somewhere who enjoys it. You like to ramble? Join the Welsh rambling club. Want to bike? Got that covered. You're a furry, sure. And, more impressively, the UK isn't that judgmental. Sure, maybe in a tiny village, but people feel safe to be gay, trans, straight, honest, true, punk, hipster, themselves. The UK has a reputation for its various counter-cultures and many people are attracted to such a country and are especially attracted to the cities that exemplified certain movements.  It's the idea, still, that in the UK you can be more honest about who you or; at least, you can re-invent yourself away from your old city/country/home.  Being how culturally varied and diverse it is, there is also a huge chance that you can find your culture here so the UK is familiar. An American missing red velvet can sure find it now, almost as good. Want to speak Thai? You can find a friend. You can move here and take your time adjusting because there is protection, there is home here so you can ease yourself in, avoid the culture shock and learn what it means to be living in Britain. There is also a lot of people who cannot speak another language besides English or speak their native language + English, so it's easy.  I hope some of that helps?"

I am impressed and interested if I see a standing building that was made in the 1800's, it's rare to see that sort of thing.  We're a young country and progress traveled west.  The ideas of centuries old pubs, architecture from many different historical periods, cathedrals and fancy language is very enticing to people from the US.  Although day to day living is likely very similar the historical and cultural aspects of life that many Britons are jaded too are completely missing from American life and to many people that's very important.  It's easy to romanticize and that's where my personal interest comes from.  As far as health bills, there is no real comparison to be made with the US.  Any developed country is better than ours.  If an American immigrant can secure a job in the UK he's likely in a skilled field anyway so I can't imagine that'd be a huge problem for that individual."

I was treated like a human being, is why I want to return to the UK. In the US I am an unfashionable minority (and mixed race, so many ignorant attempts to categorize me), and uncool, so superficial, narrow-minded, heterophobic Americans obsessed with being cool don't talk to me, but in the UK (or London, at least) I was ethnically ambiguous and exotic and therefore worth getting to know. People I met were interesting and curious (as opposed to just nosey or inquisitive). I was always interested in foreign cultures and languages (am a polyglot, a rarity in the US, and was raised in several countries) and was able to find people with upbringings similar to mine. Brits go on holidays, often to interesting places, and many times to countries that most Americans never heard of. People (in London) read, are informed and engaged with the world, have hobbies besides shopping and watching TV. They revel in the small and cosy, the eccentric, the underdog, the black side; American culture is corporate culture, the cities generally lack culture and character, and people are mostly bland, conformist (despite their mania for individualism) and small-minded. In Britain I met people who were Indian but from Uganda, or whose great-grandfather led a Ghurka regiment, or who met his/her spouse in Kazakhstan where s/he worked. Americans like to think they're exotic or mixed because their ancestors were Irish-Scottish-German (oh and they identify themselves by those nationalities even though they speak only English). The English that I met in London would take great pleasure in having a simple boozy picnic in one of the magnificent parks or in heading to a country pub for the weekend; Americans do what's trendy and cool, or just fall back to the same old shit they've always done. I don't feel like a loser for not having a car there (I hate driving anyway, also dealing with insurance, asshole drivers with big cars). I don't have to worry about guns, or being raped/ assaulted for my laptop or because I staggered back home from the pub. If my job is wearing me down I have sufficient holiday and your boss generally respects your right to take a break (no more pretending to be sick). Free museums; art is not a privilege merely for the wealthy.    I wasn't an anglophile before I arrived, though was well-versed or current regarding news, politics, cinema, music, history, etc.  I didn't want to live there because it was ""cool"" or because it was a nice topping for a white American privileged life.   TL;DR I fit in there and felt less alone yet more free. And when London/ UK became tiring I could easily take a short break, via train/ plane/ bus/ ferry."

In a month, I'll be working on my PhD in History, researching England and Scotland. My pie in the sky dream is to go and teach college/uni in the UK. In the UK, there is a tangible sense of history wherever you go.  In the US, especially in the Midwest, where I'm from, that sense is sorely lacking.  Other commenters have expressed similar sentiments - it's really nifty if I get to see a building from the 1850s.(I was lucky enough to grow up in the Amana Colonies, which, bucking the trend, is REALLY in touch with its history... but it is also a major tourist trap.)  As a culture, we're not connected to our shared history and that is a shame.  There are some efforts to preserve what little we have left, but it isn't enough.  While it'd be nice if we had castles, estate homes, walled cities, etc, like the UK, we don't.  I'd settle for more 'preserved' villages like Jamestown.  I'd love to see a pioneer town in the Midwest or old factories restored.  Anything to get an understanding of how regular people lived their lives and made our cities, states, and country what it is today.

Even at the maximum fees, it's actually an incredibly good deal compared to what it costs otherwise.  Also compare the fees to just buying a new ticket with that baggage allowance and it might even be worth it to you to just buy a new ticket so you can go back and visit after a short time (and get sweet, sweet miles)  We ended up getting space in a container and they charge by volume rather than weight and it cost about US$1300 for a bit under 2 cubic meters.

If you wanted to do grad school a student visa might be a good idea if you can find an English language program. I mention Italy because their citizenship laws make it much easier for descendents to get passports than other EU countries like Germany.

As someone who was in a LDR for 3 years before moving to the UK as a student, marrying, and staying here, I know all too well the stress of figuring out if/how you will end up in the same country. But it IS something you have to think about and grapple with and it IS something that may end up being the reason a relationship ends. My partner and I had two points in time where we said, ""if we can't work this out and live in the same country, we will have to break up,"" and I have a friend who just went through the same thing. My partner and I did manage to find a way to make it work, but we never assumed that just because we were in love, any country's immigration laws HAD to allow us to be together. We would have been heartbroken if we'd had to end it but eventually we would have recovered and moved on.  The world does not revolve around individuals and sometimes relationships don't work out for circumstances beyond our control--it can happen even if you're living in the same country.

The visa simply allows you to enter the US on a temporary, non-immigrant basis in order to work for an American employer.  For example, I actually don't live in the US; while I am working for an American employer, I am actually based in Europe and rarely set foot in the US.    Yes, the job must be temporary in order for a TN visa to be granted.  Please read the page I gave you; under the ""Eligibility for NAFTA Professional (TN) Nonimmigrant Status"" header there is a link for ""Required Documentation"" which says that the letter from your employer must state the anticipated length of the contract.  Under ""Requirements for Canadian Citizens"" there is a link to USCIS which says that the maximum stay is three years.  However, it is possible to renew the visa.   You are overthinking this.  You have a job offer.  Show up at the border with a letter saying that your initial contract is for three years, and if your employer wants you to stay longer, they will have to provide additional paperwork when the time comes.  That's it.  The whole point of the TN visa is to make it easier for professionals from NAFTA countries to work in the US.  It's not supposed to be complicated."

Then in that case as it is a country with little to no income tax like Bermuda, you should be fine anyway.

That income may be cutting it close as the page isn't clear if that's pre or post tax.

IWantOut,3dezkx,LupineChemist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's a hell of a lot of money for Spain.

My wife and I spend less than that in very central Madrid and we have a pretty nice life and don't really budget all that much.

I'm not sure about Germany, however, in the Netherlands we have regulations for non EU students that they can get an extra year on their visa after completing their studies to look for a job in the Netherlands without too much of a hassle. I'm guessing Germany will have something similar."

The thing is that in the current educational culture in (western) Europe bachelors degrees aren't valued a lot and and are considered 'incomplete' without a masters degree.   This even holds true for CS, because those jobs at bachelor level are usually jobs at start ups etc which you get in through your network. The larger, traditional companies are very unlikely to hire people with just a bachelor degree.  That being said: the moment you have a STEM masters degree, there are a lot of jobs to be found, many in engineering, but less in life sciences (biology etc)."

And, that's for a 4 year degree."
IWantOut,3dbmow,Iskandar11,6,Wed Jul 15 11:01:37 2015 UTC,"They do consider it a complete Bachelor's degree, it's just that some employers and industries are still used to the pre-Bologna system.  Most countries in Europe had a two-tier system until a couple of years ago: a first degree (nominally in the range of 4-6 years, with many different names for it) followed by a research doctorate. Details varied, especially in certain fields like medicine, but that's the general pattern.  Now, in most cases, that first degree has been basically split into two - and if you're used to the traditional system, the Bachelor's seems like a not-quite-completed degree.  (In a somewhat amusing twist, while most of the continent has made the switch to separate Bachelors and Masters programmes, the UK has seen increasing popularity of Integrated Master's programmes...)"

IWantOut,3dbmow,YeaISeddit,2,Wed Jul 15 07:49:40 2015 UTC,The difference is in Europe you don't do college or liberal arts..    I blame the fact that US there are no (public) equivalents to Gymansium/Lycee/HAVO - though plenty of people do get university credit in high school.
IWantOut,3dbmow,-Avacyn,0,Wed Jul 15 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"Few engineering degrees in the USA have electives. They're pretty jam packed. If you take electives you just concede that it will take you 5 years. Of the ~130 credit hours I accumulated in my bachelor's, 6 were from electives. I think the American bachelor's is actually more in depth in engineering subjects than European ones. The American bachelor's in engineering is also a helluva grind compared to the European counterparts. There's a much greater emphasis on weekly work than a year-end exam. I'm at a top engineering school in Europe right now and I think the undergrads are a lot weaker in the tougher subjects like thermodynamics and organic chemistry, but they gain a lot more practical experience through Praktikum and internships. Anyways I feel like the American bachelor's is the equivalent of the European bachelor's and masters. If you'd like I can put the coursework side by side to prove it. In any case employers will not give an American bachelor's any more weight unless it comes from a top 10 engineering program."

I suppose ""1, 2, 3"" aren't internationally standardised. (I get the point that there aren't many electives on the right side, just wondering how comparable these are.)"
IWantOut,3dbmow,lowenthald,4,Thu Jul 16 08:43:20 2015 UTC,"OP is a biotechnologist and therefore knows roughly what those courses are, or at least the American ones. Most of those courses aren't comparable. For instance, the mathematics course at TUM tries to slam together the same content from the 3 semesters of work at UMass into one semester course. If you flip through the Amazon preview of the text (link) you'll see that the book covers everything from the quadratic formula to basic differential equations. Calculus in the USA is always broken up into Calc 1 (limits, differentiation, integration), Calc 2 (complex integrals), Calc 3 (differential equations and vectors). Those three are covered in the last 4 weeks of the TUM course.   On the other hand, the guys at TUM get a lot more courses related directly to topics found in the Biochemistry workplace. Their Biochem 3 is a course dedicated to protein crystallization. At UMass you could take an elective on the subject, but you wouldn't be forced to learn it.   The American strategy is basically to give the students a wealth of background knowledge from which they can learn the advanced topics on their own as they see fit, while the German model is to go direct to the applications and assume the students will pick up the background on their own. In my experience, if a student doesn't learn math or thermodynamics in a rigorous course, they will never learn it so I prefer the American model."
IWantOut,3dbmow,YeaISeddit,5,Thu Jul 16 09:46:30 2015 UTC,"I think you put the difference down perfectly: a broad general STEM basis for all students in the US, especially heavy on the maths side, vs. a more specific approach in Europe at the cost of a strong back ground in those basic STEM skills.   I studied Chemistry back in the day before switching to Chemical Engineering. Chemistry has a perfect example of this: chemistry students only get the maths courses 'Calculus for Chemistry' and 'Linear Algebra for Chemistry' at my uni and these courses aren't even taught by professors but just lecturers. It's the most basic of the basic, doesn't even teach the full background of the maths but only applications relevant for chemistry. But then again, all our first year Chemistry students will know after their first year how to make and interpret NMR spectra, becauses they've done about 50 of them during practicals, while many PhD students from abroad haven't even touched or seen an NMR in real life.   Edit: by the way, this makes me realise why so many US STEM students have so much trouble getting their degree! In my country probably only the physicists and of course the mathematicians themselves would get Calc1-3 and LinAlg1-3, it's certainly not for everyone to be able to handle those courses!"
IWantOut,3dbmow,YeaISeddit,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but, don't you think that if those three semesters of math were pulled together into one course, that it would become more of a ""survey"" course in mathematics for biochemistry? At least, that's the impression that I get from the book you linked on Amazon. In other words, it seems that there might be a tradeoff in rigor, breadth, or depth in touching upon, for example, delta-epsilon limits in real analysis."
IWantOut,3dbmow,Smartare,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly right. But that's also why the American version, despite being harder and longer is not the equivalent of a European BS/MS. You would miss out on the advanced graduate level topics as well as research, to an extent."
IWantOut,3dbmow,Smartare,2,Fri Jul 17 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting background. I think you did nail it: the very idea of the Bachelor's degree as implemented in continental Europe is to be a first job-qualifying degree. That's also why its introduction was (and probably still is) heavily criticised in Germany - it was seen as dumbed-down, too specialised, and just intended to produce worker bees for industry. That may be exaggerated but there's probably a kernel of truth - if you're supposed to produce an employable graduate in 3 years, you can't spend most of that time covering background.   Those three are covered in the last 4 weeks of the TUM course.   My guess here is that at least part of the math course is assumed to be merely a refresher for what you should've already learned in Gymnasium (whether that's a reasonable assumption I can't say). Calc 1 should definitely be covered by the Abitur, and very likely at least also parts of Calc 2 and 3 as you describe them.   (While I didn't go to school in Germany, I did have calculus up to at least basic differential equations before even entering uni. But that was a few decades ago.)"
IWantOut,3dbmow,shitterbug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:43:34 2015 UTC,"And to be fair, the majority of American engineering students place out of Calc 1 as well through high school test scores. In my program I think it was nearly 100%. There's a misconception that overall Americans don't get as good a high school education as Europeans, but the truth is that our system is just not very equal. You can get a world class high school education if you are upper/middle class or you can get passed along through essentially day care programs if you are lower socioeconomic class.   I should step back and say that I don't really think one is better than the other. I think you can say objectively, that the American one is longer and covers more material. Whether that material makes you a better worker is debatable."
IWantOut,3dbmow,Smartare,5,Thu Jul 16 10:57:25 2015 UTC,It is. And most masters are 1 year (some 2). So a master degree in Europe = 4-5 years of studies.
IWantOut,3dbmow,-Avacyn,2,Wed Jul 15 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"It's quite clearly the other way round. Most masters nowadays are 2 years (120 ECTS) throughout Europe. The Bologna system stipulates a 3-5-8 scheme.   Although there are many exceptions due to remnants of traditional pre-Bologna systems, non-consecutive degrees, ""Fachhochschule""-style schools, etc. - there is no legally binding ""European system"" of university education."

IWantOut,3dbmow,freads,0,Wed Jul 15 09:13:30 2015 UTC,Most masters are 1 year in Europe and the two year masters are called 'research masters'. Law for example (as /u/Smartare noticed) can be done in 1 year or at some uni's 2 years. In both cases you will take 1 year of specialized courses and in the second year the research master students will do full time research.   Here is the trick: all STEM fields only have research master degrees!

Especially given the whole issue to do with people not getting paid and banks running out of money.   It must also be said that something that might count against me is that whilst I speak French to a pretty high standard, I've got only formal A-Level paper qualifications, which really don't count for much. A significant proportion of my language skills actually developed after I left college and entered university where I used my French for research and also as most of my social group were French speaking. Other than spending silly amounts of money on proficiency exams, it seems my language skills aren't, at least on paper, recognised."

IWantOut,3db3ef,donalddrangus,3,Tue Jul 14 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're in a similar position as I was earlier this year.  I'm not British, but I graduated with an MEng in Chemical Engineering last year from a British University. Couldn't find a graduate job there (strict immigration rules as I'm sure you know).  I came to Singapore on a Working Holiday Pass. Just like you, I heard about the good prospects for engineers here so I thought I'd give it a chance. I've now been here for 5 months, been working for the last 4 months.  If you do decide to move, here are some things you need to know:   You most likely would not get a job with an MNC here. Singapore grads are very good, the jobs are few and thus competitive, and the companies would favor Singaporeans anyway. Immigration is also getting stricter here with elections coming up. Online applications work even less here in Singapore than in UK, so don't waste time staying home and applying online. Get a job agent. My first month here I was applying online all day with no success. I decided to get an agent (for quite a high fee) and she managed to get me an internship within a week. Of course it's only an internship, but there's a very high chance this will become a permanent job if I'm lucky. If you do get a job, it will be with a local SME (small medium enterprise) or a small but international company if you're lucky.   If you want my advice, stay in UK or EU. I had to leave because my visa was running out, but you're British so you're good. If you can't find work with an MNC there, then lower your ambitions and go work for a small company. Your degree only matters for your first job, after that it's all about experience. You'll be a much better after a couple of years of experience.  However if you do decide to come to Singapore, or if you want more information, just send me a PM. I'll be glad to help!"

With just the Bachelors though, and very little experience, moving around is hard. It's not worth it for companies to hire someone who doesn't speak the local language, requires a work permit, and is not very useful, on top of that. So, gaining some experience first is very much recommended, and learning Estonian (or, at least, Russian) might help."

IWantOut,3dapzy,MonadTran,3,Tue Jul 14 23:27:30 2015 UTC,"That's up to you.   I personally would aim to get private sector experience, if possible. The incentive structure in the government agencies is very different from the private sector, and because of that, they tend to be more stagnant, and less challenging to work for. If a private company fails to deliver, they go bankrupt. If a government agency fails to deliver, they get more funding. The market forces you to be productive, while NASA... Not necessarily. If you are disciplined, and your colleagues are, too, you might still learn a lot. So... Up to you, again."

The TN visa is easier for employers to deal with compared to the H1-b but a lot do not know it exists.

IWantOut,3daopz,Sciar,2,Wed Jul 15 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"Alright so I'm a Canadian in America at the moment and I just spoke with an immigration lawyer not too long ago. I'm in Florida atm but I don't believe that has any importance.  TN visas are the way to go, look up the requirements, they basically allow you to get a job and just come work for 2 years and can be renewed. The requirements are ass low and it's basically the visa equivalent of open borders. The H1 is a giant pain in the ass and Canadians are allowed to circumvent it with this.  In terms of where to work or what to do... well I can't really help you with that. You need to hunt down a job exactly the same way you would in Canada. Apply and the vast majority of places should be totally willing to let you do a phone interview or Skype interview at least for the initial portion. Whether or not they want to meet you in person is up to the both of you.  You can let them know the requirements for hiring a Canadian as most places will need to know that and wont be used to the TN visa process or it's simplicity (Most businesses expect hiring foreigners is ridiculously difficult and immediately throw your resume away).  Personally I've flown halfway around the world for a job in the past and I only needed a Skype interview. So most companies willing to hire a foreigner should be fine with that or they should expect to pay your flights to get you to come in for an interview."

Getting a Tier 2 visa is extremely difficult, if not impossible, unless you are lucky enough to have a job on the job shortage list. This exempts a potential employer from the resident labour market test before offering you the job.  If your job isn't listed there, then you're up against the following restrictions:  -Your potential employer must be a registered Tier 2 visa sponsor  -Resident labour market test: The job you're applying for must have been posted for a full 28 days without any attention from qualified applicants in all of the UK or EU (usually this would be a job which demands a unique skill and lots of experience)  -The offered salary is £20,800 or more  -You have about £950 in savings to show, this doesn't include the cost of applying for the visa  As you can see, it's not really a winning game unless you're uniquely experienced. The other thing you can do is try to get a job with a UK branch which might offer you the opportunity to be transferred (must be at least a managerial level with appropriate salary), but that's never a guarantee.

I don't think there's any other work-based visa that you can just ""decide"" to get without a sponsor.    If you are indeed referring to the WHV, then as far as I'm aware, you have to apply for the visa from outside Australia and be outside Australia when the visa is granted.  So you would have to return to the US anyway.  The $5000 is the recommended amount considered to be sufficient funds, which you could be asked to provide proof of when re-entering the country with the WHV.  They won't necessarily ask for it nor will they necessarily absolutely require $5000, but this unofficial website recommends having at least $3000 to be safe.    http://goworkabout.com/information/visas/  Edit: yeah, also says on http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/462-  ""You must be outside Australia when the application is lodged and the visa is granted.

It's a net gain.   But then, I moved to Britain.  ** Please note, I am not painting Britain in any kind of negative light, just explaining something I have seen increase **  For context, I am an staunch middle-class foreigner working in London with a British spouse. Together we earn over 6 digits, but still cannot afford on our combined salary to put together a deposit to buy a house in London. Yes, we could move out of the city or downsize our rental budget, spending money or travel. So, this is partially priorities, but as someone who grew up in idyllic America (aka the late 80s and early 90s), I have always assumed you could have all three. This context is important because most of our friends are in the same earning bracket as us and as my husband is not from any kind of ""old"" money, the majority of his friends are also people who managed to get excellent careers. I work in finance, he is a software engineer. The point is: our social circle is very much highly educated people, most with post-graduate degrees.  90% of the British people we know swear up and down they hate UKIP, that BNP is a plague, but privately, when you speak to them one on one, they all reveal they want migration to end. They don't want any more Eastern Europeans. They're sick of the French, Spanish and Italian, too, and they really cannot stand the fact they (other Europeans) can just rock the fuck up with their spouses and even, in some cases, unmarried partners. And, bizarrely, a lot of our foreign friends, particularly Americans, Australians and Canadians who should have no pony in this race, say the same things.  The way they see it is that it is Britain being punished. The vast majority move here because of a strong economy and English was the second language of choice. They feel it is unfair they don't have the same opportunity to move to Spain, Italy or, hell, Hungary and maintain a similar life, or find a job. Those that have went felt they were judged for taking jobs from the other unemployed youth and felt isolated, even where they could find a job, because of the language. The only places commonly agreed on as being ""okay"" are Scandinavia + Benelux, owing to the fact they also mostly speak English and have strong economies, but most don't know where to start or how to make the move because there isn't exactly a lot of support on that end, while in other countries there are companies helping people find jobs in the UK.  The truth is, and it is scary, a lot of young Britons, are starting to feel like their country is being used. NHS for people who have never paid in the system. Welfare benefits for people who worked the bare minimum to qualify. Everyone comes to their home, but where are they going? It's driving the prices up for British people, across the board, on all items, but especially housing. It's not a joke people can't afford to buy in London or live and rent in zones 1 or 2 without sacrificing the chance to buy, unless you're in a 1% earning bracket. It's not about limiting job opportunities because it is universally agreed the majority of people moving here are not high-value workers, so none of them complain about the Polish girl serving them pints or the Spaniard ringing them up at Burberry. The high-value workers? The ones that work with them, the ones who work in law, as a GP, in banks; well, they should be able to get a Tier 2 visa and they feel the rules on that should be relaxed to encourage that sort of immigration.  What has disturbed me is it is becoming more and more pervasive and it isn't just Britain, and it isn't just your classical migrants, where you think of the Polish electrician or the African wanting hand-outs. It's turning on the EU and it's a lot of resentment for what the EU forces the UK to do, but in turn doesn't honour the UK's laws. For example, issues often cited: people claiming passports through easier EU countries (Italy, here's looking at you) specifically to live in the UK without offering any skills (e.g. they want to just work in a bar or want to pursue a very saturated field like marketing), the  migration laws of spouses and partners of Europeans that is not granted to British nationals (it is £65 for a German to bring their partner to the UK, it is a combined total, over life of £3000, CURRENTLY, as well as earnings proof for a British national to bring their spouse to live here), other European countries complain Britain doesn't take the brunt of the African and Middle Eastern Migration (particularly France and Italy), but Britain already feels hard done by in that area.  It's been really eye-opening and interesting because I had always thought of immigration and global migration as a huge benefit that everyone could see. At a push, my only thing is that I don't particularly like when someone wants to move somewhere to take advantage of the system. It's been a very bizarre thing to find out and learn, this strange dichotomy between what people are saying and doing and it's pretty clear in how the conservative party remained in power and UKIP continues to make gains. Where are the votes coming from? No one will admit it, but as conversations turn political I am starting to wonder if it is my friends who put their votes that way while declaring in large groups a much more liberal, nuanced view of migration. It's really sad that this is happening and that many western European nations want to close their borders. What else is the point of the EU except for a freedom of exchange, be it people, culture, ideas or goods?  This isn't even getting into the other areas the UK is becoming increasingly anti-EU, but that's another discussion not for this subreddit. Has anyone else noticed any of the above living in the UK?"
IWantOut,3d5zcv,courters,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:26:46 2015 UTC,"I think the things you mention are mostly Britain mishandling and not really realising they are actually in the EU. When they talk of Europe they mean the continent as if they forgot they are part of both Europe and the EU. They don't even have the euro, aren't in Schengen and they demand a rebate because they don't want to pay for the EU. Politically they sidelined themselves, they weren't pushed into that by others.  That British citizens need to pay 3000 to get a spouse over is the fault of their own government, no one else. When they agreed to the open borders they would have known that people from poorer regions would come. It's not uniquely Britain, it happens a lot in the Netherlands and Germany too.  Another problem is that you mainly talk of London. London is a clusterfuck because in the UK everything happens in London so of course everything is going to be unaffordable there. The population distribution of Britain is ridiculous. If you look at Germany you see the complete opposite: the population and economic activity (mostly) are quite evenly distributed around the country. It is a ""large city problem"" and London has it too the extreme.  And for the languages: if you want to live in a country you'll need to speak the language in most cases. If British people don't learn other languages maybe there is something wrong with the education system. And don't underestimate the advantages of having English as a native language, I had to learn English from scratch because pretty much nothing gets translated into Dutch. The downside is that it puts less pressure on native English speakers to learn English.  I think that with the open and connected economies (free movement of goods and capital) there will be a movement of people too. Britain more or less invented the global economy."

Not sure where the link between you not affording your chosen place to live and immigration comes in.  I think you realize that though...

If you read what I wrote I disagree with the whole anti-migration argument, but was laying out what people around me are saying and where the anti-migration argument is rising in London.  People equate more people with higher rent costs because of scarcity. It's simple economics. The harder it is to find accommodation, the more accommodation can charge. The problem is a lot of people living in London who are British see the influx of non-Brits and equate the shortage and therefore price hike with the migration, which then feeds a desire to shorten immigration. Does that make sense?  Like any Londoner who isn't Roman Abramovich I am disenchanted with the rental market, but I don't blame anyone for it."

IWantOut,3d42me,see-emm-why-kay,3,Mon Jul 13 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"I live in London and worked with a lot of people from Poland in the various pubs and bars around central - I'm still friends with a lot of them too. I have a friend who now lives in Prague with her boyfriend, and comes back to work in pubs and restaurants every summer.  The easiest way to find work in bars is usually just to go in and ask if they have any vacancies, and see if you can talk to the manager. Most pubs in central london have a high turnover, so jobs turn up pretty regularly. It's a pretty similar situation in restaurants. If you've got previous experience that's obviously a bonus.  As for accommodation, London is obviously very expensive, but this just depends on what you're looking for. There are plenty of hostels and shared accommodation around if you're OK with sharing a room, though this isn't something I'd be able to do myself!  Edit: typo's"

IWantOut,3d51hl,Ohuma,3,Mon Jul 13 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"I was just traveling. I thought the people were amazingly. Probably the best in Europe. It has a bit of a reputation of being a risky and dangerous place. Granted I am a man, I was aimlessly walking around at night and didn't feel scared or threatened at any point.  In Northern Albania, I was in Skoder. It was a really beautiful little city. Small, but it was there was always something going on and people were always out and about. Everything was dirt cheap. It was kind of unbelievable. You hear that about a lot of places, but you end up paying tourist prices. There, you pay local prices.   Tirana was dirty, run down, grim, and decrepit looking. It was cheap and fun, but I wouldn't ever want to live there. I could handle Skoder.   I might have liked it less if my expectations weren't so low to begin with.   I have to say that it was really difficult to get in and get out. Train lines are all under repair so there is no central train station and you can't get a train in or out.   There is also no central bus station. They drop you off somewhere outside the city centre and you really have no clue where to go. Very few people speak English but everyone was willing to help when they found out I was American. On a couple occasions I had people literally take me to where I needed to be. Didnt matter if it was down the block or 1km away.   In a lot of the Balkan countries, in order to get out of the country, you have to book a bus out with a travel agency. That makes it difficult since there is no central station where you go. You literally have to walk around the city and find travel agencies and compare prices.  All in all, minus the inconveniences, I really liked Skoder. I'd definitely go back if I had the chance."

I don't even feel safe sometimes in the US at night! Are there other places you have visited that were affordable (doesn't have to be that cheap) that you would recommend?"
IWantOut,3d51hl,Ohuma,2,Mon Jul 13 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the U.S. is more dangerous in the U.S. I didn't feel as safe in my city in the U.S. as I do in any place I've been to in Europe, including Albania.   I wouldn't sweat it. Just take normal precautions as you would anywhere else. I've seen girls solo travel through the Balkans before. Stay at a hostel, make friends, and you won't be alone.  I am very budget minded when I travel. I've been to every country in Central and Eastern Europe except Belarus (This September). The cheapest places I've been to recently have been (in order): Albania, Moldova, Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Romania.  Though everywhere in EE is cheap compared to the U.S.  Depending on what you want to do and see, you could choose any country in EE. Bosnia was super cheap, had stunning scenery, and good nightlife while Romania had good beaches, deep history, and many beautiful things to see.  Ukraine was great for nightlife, but wasn't too easy to get around in Kiev, but Odessa was one of my favorite cities.  If you're a bit skeptical, perhaps it would be best to start in Prague and work your way through. Perhaps, Prague --> Budapest --> Krakow, Poland or Timisoara, Romania, Lviv, Ukraine. Or you can always go to Saint Petersburg, Russia (the best city in Europe) which is where I live now. I can show you around and then you can go through the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) -- all reasonably cheap and contain very charming cities, like Tartu, Tallin, Kaunas, and Vilnius with Riga being the most lively and entertaining of the bunch  Depending on where you start will have large implications where you finish since most of the cities aren't well connected. For instance, once you drop yourself in Montenegro you really only have a couple options where to go from there.  I highly suggest posting ANY questions you have in /r/travel.

IWantOut,3d51hl,letsboogiewarrior3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:44:16 2015 UTC,Wow! This is all really interesting. Do you have a blog where you have documented all of the places you have gone? I would really love to read more about it. I have so many questions...How did you end up living in Russia? What do you do for a living that you can afford to travel so much? (you have been seemingly everywhere!) And how long have you been traveling? When were you bitten by the travel bug? When you go places is it for a vacation or an adventure?   If you have a blog that will answer all of that I will gladly read through it all instead of pestering you. Thank you so much for the tips and I will be sure to check out r/travel!
IWantOut,3d51hl,DeftNerd,2,Tue Jul 14 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"Nope, no blog yet. I had one in the works, but my life became too busy. Stay tuned, I could have one up as soon as the end of this fall.  I don't really have any money tricks when it comes to traveling so much. There are definitely things you can do to extend trips, like helpx.net or wwoof (which you work on someone's property for a meal and a bed). I work my ass off for 6-12 months at a time, accumulate money, quit and then travel.   I went to Russia because of my studies. I have an educational background which would be better suited if I affixed Russian Language to it. So I am there studying Russian and Russian culture. It's great because I was never in that part of the world before and it gave me access to different countries I would not have gone to otherwise.  I travel off and on. Usually 4-6 months at a time. It becomes difficult after not seeing your family for such a long time, especially on birthdays and holidays. If I didn't have two young nephews, it would be much easier never to go back and perpetually travel.  I've always had the travel bug. Hockey was my favorite sport as a kid. I'd always have hockey cards with player's biographies on there. I was always fascinated about the origins of some of these players that it began to pique my interest in geography. From that point, I was hooked. However, I didn't begin traveling until 2012. I had money issues and not a single friend had the same interest as me. After sometime I did find a friend to go with and I knew that was what I wanted to do. Though after that point, I realized it was better and easier to travel alone.  To me, a vacation is taking a cruise or sitting on some all-inclusive resort.  Though, I wouldn't say it is for an adventure either. For me, it is a learning experience. I like to see what the life is like in these places... how they live, what they eat, what they do for fun -- just their way of life.  I met a guy in Moldova who was literally traveling just to say he has been there. That's not a big deal and I am not a travel snub, but he was going to 1 new country per day. It is impossible to get a feel for anything doing that. But everyone travels differently.  I prefer staying in one place for a long time. It is easier to befriend locals and because of that your stay could truly be special. Other times, I'll only plan to stay there for 2-3 nights. It depends on what I've heard and researched"

I wonder if this is the same thing you are talking about.
IWantOut,3d51hl,2xtreme21,4,Mon Jul 13 19:52:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe. In her case,it just sounds like she's overstaying on her visa. A visa run would be to leave the country for a very short time in order to  renew the visa, then continuing to do so for as long as you wish. So they're legally doing this, while an expired visa could have consequences."
IWantOut,3d51hl,CantFlyWontFly,0,Mon Jul 13 19:57:23 2015 UTC,She is a US citizen and Peru does not require a visa for visits so I think she is just overstaying the legal limit of not needing a visa. But I see now what you are saying a visa run is and she was doing something very close to that with her visits home. But she was going much farther than she needed to just to renew probably because she was also trying to retain her citizenship by spending a certain number of days per year in the US.
IWantOut,3d51hl,zixx,2,Mon Jul 13 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the ""retain her citizenship by spending a certain number of days per year in the US"" part. Are you implying that if one were to stay outside of the US, one would lose his US citizenship? That is so not true."

Similar policy as the UK, once you are done with your studies you are supposed to leave the country unless you find a job.  Basically right after graduation, you have 90 days unemployment period to either find a job or pack up (you have to apply for OPT months before graduation). Say if you find a job, you continue to work for a year (initial OPT length) and if you are STEM major you can extend for another 17 months.  Oh shit my extension is almost done. Well at this point your employer will have to apply work visa (H1-B) for you. It costs a lot and it's up to your employer's discretion if they want to do it for you. No, you cannot offer to pay the fee. No, you cannot file the paperwork yourself. The application and the payment have to be done by your employer. Even if your employer does that, H1-B is not guaranteed. It's sort of a lottery process and every fiscal year there are tons more application than the allocated slot, this fiscal year included  All in all, it's a long process to stay indefinitely in America.

I've met several restaurant and hotel owners who started in CR and moved to one of these countries because the grass was greener. None of them seemed to be second guessing the move.  If you don't know much about the countries, Panama is the most developed Central American country and has the best infrastructure (roads, 'dependable' power, etc). Nicaragua is the 'safest' country in Central (not sure how that's quantified, but it's oft repeated) and more rustic than Western CR."

More objective measures point out it ranks highest in The UN's Human Development Index and Per Capita GDP (by a significant margin). In fact, when you hear The Economist talk about Central American Economies, they often exclude Panama from their comparisons because it's really not a fair comparison. They'll say ""Belize has seen the highest growth among Central American economies over the preceding three years, if you exclude Panama.""  Nicaragua's safety is analyzed here (from 2012). It's Intentional Homicide Rate slipped below Costa Rica's in 2014, making it the lowest in the region. I'd like to see a more comprehensive stat than just homicide, something that includes armed robbery and the like, but I can't find anything at the moment.  In South America, The Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Uraguay, Brazil(?)) are the more developed countries, though Colombia probably ranks highly as well. For safety consult the above link on homocides, but keep in mind it's often very regional; much of the violent crime may be restricted to specific areas of the country."

Would be able to keep my current stable and comfortable life that I have been living all this time. Though I may always wonder ""What if?""   I'll just put in my two cents.  The fun thing about living abroad mainly comes at first in the ""honeymoon phase"" - this is the first 3-6 months where everything is new and exciting and different.  After that, it's not as fun anymore - you're just going and doing your thing every day and living, the same as you did where you came from.  This is why I vote option #4 in your situation.  The ""honeymoon phase"" is exactly the same feeling you get when traveling, only in the latter you see and experience even more because you're not purposefully planted in one place.  And a lot of the new stuff you experience when actually living abroad is dealing with foreign bureaucratic structures and figuring out really boring stuff (how do I pay my electric bill? where do I buy a vacuum cleaner?). You also won't ever earn more money and live a more comfortable life than you probably were making in the US, and there you don't even need the degree.  You may very well be utterly sick of being abroad after a year of travel, and I don't see how doing a bachelors degree in Germany or Japan will make you more marketable in the US anyway.

Maybe if you're a bit patient, you could get your degree first. It shouldn't be hard for you now that you have a lot of experience. Who knows, maybe you could even get a Master's while you're at it.  I think going the education route is a bit tricky; it doesn't usually give you the right to stay and look for a job afterwards.

(I will be taking that test in December).   In general you need N2 or better to have any shot of working for a Japanese company in this sort of field.   Option 1: Finding work in Japan/Germany (unlikely due to degree issue) - My question on this is whether or not exceptions can be made with experience.   The Japanese rule is 'a degree or 10 years of work experience in your field"". If you fulfill that and get job with a company who will sponsor you, you can probably get a work visa.  The problem is..   My professional experience in real-time television of graphics definitely makes me at minimum 1 out of 1000.   Unless you are fluent in Japanese and have experience doing this sort of work in Japanese, no company in this field will give you the time of day. Even if you're the best foreigner at doing what you do, you're still not as good as a native Japanese speaker who can communicate quickly and understandably with all of his coworkers.  This is true of any tech job in Japan. There's plenty of threads in /r/japan, etc about the job market in IT-related fields, you should search for them (that doesn't mean 'post a new thread' because we get them all the time and it's always the same thing).

But somewhere else it says that to apply for a residence permit, I need to have been living in the UK for at least 5 years. Which is not my case.  It seems that my wife will be able to get a 6 months working visa. But what happens after that? Does she needs to re-apply to this visa every 6 months until I'm eligible for the Residence Permit?

She doesn't actually need a permit or residence card, those are superfluous to her ability to reside in the UK. She's not going to be removed from the UK if her permit expires, and the EEA family permit is not a work visa. It doesn't actually do anything but give concise proof at the border (or to an employer) that she has the right to live and work in the UK. She could accomplish the same by showing a marriage certificate and your passport, but the family permit allows her to travel freely on her own without these other documents. It makes life a lot easier for everyone.  Before her EEA family permit expires, she can apply for a residence permit which again is not a legal necessity, but rather an undeniable proof of right to work. Note that the ""permanent residence card"" (which requires 5+ years residence) differs from a residence card. https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-uk-residence-card/overview  I think the site you're referring to is describing a permanent residence card."

Yes, you have to keep extending your residence permit (not visa - that's just to get in initially) to get enough residency years for citizenship. No visa (or initial residence permit) will give you enough time for citizenship, except possibly if you're married to a citizen of that country. Keep in mind that not all types of residency ""count"", eg. time as a student or visitor (even if it's a long time) typically does not count towards citizenship. The exact rules vary widely from country to country, obviously.  I don't think permanent residence has any advantages over citizenship, but it's typically a prerequisite for citizenship anyway.

Canada has reciprocal arrangements with a lot of Euro countries. wouldn't necessarily start with the country you want to settle in most or have the best chances with.   With being in the middle of your phD you're in a weird position because there's still more work to be done on your dissertation and job opportunities may not fall into place without being able to write doctorate on that resume, especially given that your background is politics and not something uber-in-demand. But you could string together a bunch of visas - a year in belgium, a year in france, a couple years in ireland, couple years in UK. That might be more conducive to getting a foot in networking wise and, once you complete your dissertation, finding a job able and willing to sponsor you.

IWantOut,3cynn5,mc_thomp,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"Canada does have culture, it's just not European culture, and it's still being defined. People from outside North America like to say North Americans don't have culture, when it's just we don't have ancient culture.  Canada is a large country with lots of room, and lots of nature even in urban areas, the co-existence and understanding and even connection with nature is something that I would argue is part of the Canadian culture. Most people here are partially environmentally aware; not eco-friendly, but most of us understand what true wilderness is, and that is something that I'd say most European have absolutely no connection to. There simply isn't forests, and wildlife areas in Europe(excluding Russia) that are even comparable to Canada.   We have national parks that are double the size of Belgium.  We also have the native situation which isn't present anywhere in Europe. When you come here you need to realize you are basically a guest here, and most Canadians find it a touchy issue to talk about because I think most of us feel bad; recent immigrant or not.  All of this affects the culture of Canada, and an immigrant would not be able to see this unless they fully immersed themselves in Canada and did ""Canadian"" past times.  We have awesome cities, but our culture and life is centred around the wilderness, even city dwellers in Toronto have cottages 7 hours up north in the middle of bear countries and will drive pick-up trucks.  I'm sorry, not ranting, or getting mad at you, just thought I'd sort've explain something about Canada that really isn't known, and it is the importance of wilderness to Canadians. And I'd argue that is a part of our culture.  Going camping, going hiking, going on trails, atving, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, going on road trips(where you just drive to a remote or far off location), even hunting; can be controversial in urban areas, and just anything to do with being outside is like dug into the mindset of the majority of Canadians, and I think Europeans don't see that as culture because it is so far off from their highly developed sophisticated arts related culture.  Canada has it's own art scene that is unique to Canada, and an awesome music scence, but I'd still argue the most universal thing about Canadian culture is feeling more like you are living in the wilderness even if you are in a city,because every city is separated from eachother by vast unspoiled wilderness.  I know it's not really specific to culture just saying being connected to the outdoors but it shows in our preferences for activities, Canada has ""developed"" many different sports on it's own which is impressive for a small country so that sort've shows the outdoorsyness, and it shows in our national symbols(all of which are just wild animals), our flag is a maple leaf(again plant life), most of our famous artists were inspired by nature(the group of seven look their art up its awesome). I could go on and on and wish I wrote this more coherently but I stopped to eat like 5 times while writing this and lost my train of thought.  It's also more common to meet a Canadian who does work that would be considered ""third world"", in Canada than basically any other developed nation, that is a Canadian who works in the mining industry, forestry, or oil industry, all of these are very important to us still, and you are always guaranteed a job in any of those industries. We have an educated population so our primary sectors run much more efficiently than a lot of other countries.  But yes, a lot of Canada still has a blue collar feel to it, especially outside of all the major cities, much more so than I'd say anywhere else on Earth.  The economy is slipping in certain areas, but you will always find work here if you are versatile, and work with decent pay too. Most people are just only willing to do white collar work, so they don't take advantage of the fact Canada has a huge primary industry, that pays pretty good. You can make $500 a day planting trees, work 4 months of the year and take the rest off and live relatively comfortably, but again, most Westerners wouldn't want to do that, but there are a decent amount of Canadians who will do ""hearty"" work.  It's hard to explain, but Canada does have a culture, and as I've said, and most canadians won't realize it, a lot of it is affected by the vast size of the country."

Lifestyle is better even if I can't put a finger on why exactly - people do more outdoor things, participate more in events around them and there are tonnes of events in the cities in summer.   As for the weather I have my best tan in years in Toronto. Never been in winter but summer is very warm and sunny but there will be occasional thunder storms/heavy rains. My SO and Canadian friends assure me the winter is baltic and there will be a lot of snow but there is still sun, apparently, less dingy/dreary than UK.

I live just outside of Toronto and it is an awesome and fantastic city. It is a big melting pot of every culture you can imagine and everyone here (give or take that everywhere has it's assholes etc) are very friendly. I haven't not been asked every single week since I moved here where I am from because people notice my accent and like it. It's an instant conversation-starter and people seem genuinely interested and caring. Also, there are a lot of people here who's ancestors are British, which quite a few have mentioned to me.  The one and only thing I dislike is the climate where I am but please bear in mind that I don't drive (which I think is a big thing for me when it comes to the winters). Winters (full on snow) lasts between 4-5 months and the temperature sits at around -15c to -28C for that entire time. If it's -10C that feels ""balmy"" and almost ""tropical"".... at this point that has ceased to be a joke and is serious for me! I wouldn't mind quite as much if it was only for a month or two but it really does feel like it goes on for as long as it does, a huge chunk of the year.  I do miss things from the UK, I do miss the old beautiful architecture and sometimes the atmosphere and the food (specific things I like, like Chinese food from there and the chocolate... it just isn't the same here but it's probably better I don't eat either of those here!).  However, food here is also amazing, anything you desire you can find.  If you'd like to know anything more specific feel free to ask.

Anyway, to summarize: I have no idea what I would need to relocate, where to look or anything like that. I've only ever lived in the same province - travelled to Europe but that's it. So I'm looking for a starting point, if anyone knows the demand for pharmacists in the UK, where to look regarding licensing and what not. Basically need information on anything/everything. I'm single too so it would just be myself. It would be this time next year, as I would likely get licensed in Canada first."

My husband studied chemistry at Leeds and his former classmates in pharmacy studies are all unemployed (or have changed careers... because of the unemployment). I can say confidently that this is not a good decision and unless you are eligible for an ancestry visa through a British grandparent, there's zero chance you'll emigrate because you simply won't get work sponsorship.

Keep in mind, you'll be earning more in the more expensive one anyway - so the price thing is a bit moot. ""More expensive"" might just mean you can buy more US real estate (as an investment).   Also, Australia is isolated from the US/Europe. But there are loads of great places to visit near Australia - that Canada and Europe are equally isolated from. Think beautiful tropical islands like Fiji, countries like Thailand or New Zealand, even Hong Kong and Japan are relatively close. I love all of these places and that they are ""near neighbors"". Many of my friends ski each year in Japan, and Christmas vacations in South East Asia are relatively common.   Also, the ""adventurous"" part of Australia is overstated in the media. Yes, you can drive or fly for a few hours from a city and reach some pretty amazing outdoor destinations. But you can do that in the US and Canada, too. Australia is a very safe, and very urban, place, and it's the cities (with holidays further out if you want) that will be your main experience.   Why not visit Australia for a holiday, if you've visited Canada? Aim for late Spring or early Autumn, and make sure you try both Sydney and Melbourne (I like Tasmania also, and many Americans seem to end up choosing Brisbane for some reason). Possibly add in a holiday destination nearby, like Lombok. You'll get a better sense of Australia's Asian character, which you might like more, or less, than the different cultural quality that you know in the Americas."

The interior mountains of B.C actually has the nicest weather, and Southern Ontario/ Southern Quebec both have distinct seasons, with much nicer summers, springs, and falls than Vancouver, the only thing better in Vancouver is the winter isn't as cold, but most people I know that have moved out west thought the weather was depressing, and didn't like how it never got too hot(it does but not nearly as often as Ontario).  Australia is isolated as fuck in my opinion, and I feel like it doesn't have the wide variety of options that canada does.  You could move to Quebec and have to learn an entirely different language, or if you move to the East Coast it's entirely different than from Ontario or the West.  Canada is not that cheap if you are going to live in Vancouver, or Toronto area, they are very expensive, Montreal actually is the best price for the size of the city and what you get. I'm from the Toronto area, but I know Montreal is pretty much Canada's best city, it has so much more to offer in terms of life than basically any of the other cities.  Vancouver really isn't that great, most Canadians will flail me for saying this, but Toronto is a better city to live in if you want ""urban"" life, Vancouver isn't even comparable to the size, diversity and options that Toronto can offer, it just has the nicest scenery. But being on Lake Ontario and having stronger sunshine isn't too bad for Toronto either.  Again, Montreal actually is the best city, it's the most affordable out of the major ones, and is more developed and has more to offer, and you aren't too far away from the majority of the Eastern U.S seaboard and the majority of the Canadian population. There is a large English community there, and learning a new language is actually a benefit to moving somewhere else because it's better for your brain and your personality.   This is just my opinion.  Australia I know is just isolated, and has a huge beach culture, Canada is isolated but close to the U.S, and has different cultures depending were you go(maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, B.C, all are worlds apart)  I really just don't recommend Vancouver, the only thing it wins in is for Natural beauty and slightly higher quality of life(you can have just as good a life eslewhere in Canada), and for weather if you don't want any cold, but it will never be hot, and it's always sort've cool there, and rains A LOT. It's also the most expensive to live, is one of the smaller metro areas(Toronto is double the size, Montreal is almost double), and just about everything in Vancouver is worse. If you are really worried about jobs, Toronto is basically the best choice, and if you are really worried about affordability, Montreal is the best, and if you are worried about ""natural beauty"" Vancouver is the winner but I don't think it's good enough reason."

Hiring a non-EU citizen is complicated and expensive and is usually reserved for only the highest positions (education-wise) where a specific profile is hard to find otherwise. Legally, a person from outside EU can only be employed if it can be demonstrated that it was impossible to find the right person for the job in the Union. As a rule of thumb, do not expect to be granted a working visa if you are not very highly educated or have a specific rare set of skills that is in very high demand and low supply.  You have an illusion that that is not necessary because you hold an EU citizenship and can freely travel and work anywhere in the Union.

So, on one side you have to pay an annual tuition to be inscribed to the doctoral school and on the other side you'll get a monthly salary either through a scholarship or a research contract.   As others have suggested, I stongly advise against taking a PhD position that is not fully funded. It'll be your job and source of salary. Immigration, bank account et cetera would not be an issue then. You don't see many US PhD students in Europe but it is full students from all over the world, so I don't see how being from the US would make a difference.  Have a look at Euraxess website for open positions. On the right bar you can select the country, the field of research and you would be an ""early stage researcher""."
IWantOut,3cu3s9,stealthisnick,2,Sat Jul 11 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"To reply to a few of your questions, UK schools are extremely welcoming for international students - if you do your PhD there, you will likely find that many of your fellow students are international. Scholarships or studentships for non-UK/EU students are highly competitive, and there are not too many of them for students from the USA. Those that there are, you will need to apply very early for. You can take out US student loans to pay for grad school in the UK. Admissions requirements may vary according to your school and your program. Setting up bank accounts is pretty easy as long as you're a registered student. If you have questions, feel free to ask the International Offices of the schools where you would like to apply. They've tightened restrictions on post-degree work since I left at then end of 2010, so I can't speak to that. It also might depend on your employer and how eager they are to have you. For during-degree work, unless it's changed, you can work 20 hours/week in term time, and 40 hours/week outside of term time. Also, you can work anywhere: the US limits international students to work on campus unless they have special permission.

I can't remember specifics other than the typical ones (Marshall and Rhodes - actually IIRC Rhodes has an age limit) but you should be able to find more with a quick google search.   In any case, I would not do a PhD that requires you to pay anything. If you can't get funding, look into different countries (I'm doing mine in HK where there is great funding).

The only way people will warm up to you is if you have a liason to introduce you. Ukraine dare I say is more progressive than Serbia? Serbians dont have the America-hero-worship many other countries have because of the Nato-led bombing campaign so i think its fair to say they don't like America, but they are ok with Americans only because so many of us live here and send money back home.

Yes you'll make more, but the majority of people there struggle to survive, and this may create an environment that most sane people would not enjoy living in by choice.  It's so bad that many Serbians are trying to immigrate to Hungary and Hungary is now building a frickin' wall at their Serbian border to keep Serbs out (part of the government's anti-immigration mania at the moment).  And let me tell you, thinks aren't exactly peaches and cream in terms of surviving in Hungary either.   On the day I want to fly out I see $800+ ticket prices.    Those are completely ordinary prices, in fact that's cheap for summer.  It may be possible to find cheaper, but only to certain cities, mid-week, and in months like February when few people travel.  Anyway you better get a longer term visa sorted out well before you even start thinking about your plane ticket.   but I don't see any smaller apartments being listed on any English site.

IWantOut,3cw0xj,polikorn,7,Sat Jul 11 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"I just went through this very thing.  My mother was born while my grandfather was stationed at Lakenheath.  Your mother should have a British birth certificate seeing as she was born over there.  Because of when she was born, your mother is a British citizen.  Here's the cool part:  British citizenship can be passed down by birth for ONE generation.  You and I were born in the same year with my mother being born 5 years after yours.  YOU ARE ALREADY A BRITISH CITIZEN!  Here's what you need to do! 1.) Find your mother's British birth certificate. -If she has it in-house, awesome you're set.  If not, you will need to contact the appropriate registry in the UK.  Some google-fu should show you where.  2.) Get YOUR birth certificate. -Your B.C. should list your mother's name in the appropriate box. -If your mother changed her name from her maiden name, you MIGHT have to send in your parent's marriage license to prove the name change.  I sent my parent's license in just as a precaution.  No idea if they actually looked at it.  3.)Get correctly sized and staged passport photos made at a qualified shop/storefront.  -The requirements for UK passport photos are listed on the UK govt. passport site.  4.) Visit https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport -Get as much information as you can. -Try not to over-complicate things.  The language is a bit odd for Americans (or maybe just me), and may stress you out.  Don't let it.  You are a citizen.  The folks who have commented before me are mistaken.  5.)Be prepared to pay through the nose. -A UK passport is not cheap, especially if applying internationally.  I think all-told I spent $200-$250. -This is including using DHL to ship everything out, so I paid a bit of a premium.  I don't trust USPS with sensitive personal papers.  6.) Find a (reputable) countersignatory. -This part can cause stress due to all of the requirements listed by the govt. for one to qualify as a countersignatory.  It's actually quite simple and comes down to a difference in wording. -I used my old General Manager from a previous retail job as my countersignatory and had no problem.  I think any person in good standing (not a felon) with at least a management level job will do.  It took my passport about 5 weeks to arrive, and that was with having to resend my declaration paper because my signature ran outside the box (yeah I'm an idiot).    So yeah.  Congratulations, you are already a citizen of the UK and you have been since birth.  You won't be able to pass it down to YOUR children unless they're born in the uk or you marry someone from the UK and then make babies, but you should be all set.  HAVE FUN GETTING YOUR PASSPORT!

I think I have a good handle on the various options, but have never heard of flat out citizenship for sale like this. The investment leading to residency, however, is a different thing, available in Hungary and lots of other countries.

You can get details at the embassy or one of the consulates, depending where you are."

IWantOut,3cnuka,houseofwinsor,3,Fri Jul 10 04:06:41 2015 UTC,"You're only limiting yourself ;) You can certainly travel and/or move to another country as a marketer. It all depends on what you make of your skills.  I'm currently working on a startup with someone in the U.S. who is a marketer. His plan is to be nomadic and travel while working. If he can do it, as many others have, so can you.  Marketers have great skills that some developers don't. You have great abilities to test the market on an idea, talk to customers, and more. Once you test an idea, go hunting on /r/startups or /r/entrepreneur for a developer to work with. That's how many people in your position do it and it's how I met my business partner."
IWantOut,3cnuka,interiorlittlevenice,0,Fri Jul 10 07:01:37 2015 UTC,"Your very correct that you can live between various countries as a nomadic marketer.  Neither would it be a walk in the park nor impossible.  As you say, your partner is on his way to become a nomadic marketer.  Now, I'd be lying if I were to say that I'm doing all that I can.  I'm only 24 years old, but this past year I've been teaching in Korea and I could have been spending my free hours doing something (or tried to find a marketing job in the states, but screw that I say).  Some sort of a part time marketing something, I'm not sure what, but I'd concede that to you.  However, my dream is literally just a work visa in an EU country.  I'm a bit more partial to some countries than others of course (I know Europe just isn't one country and yes I'm aware that every European country has its own problems, just like everywhere else).  How much I'd be paid and how much career potential I'd have compared to back home, would not matter.  Such a simple request, but with a BS in Marketing, well...request denied.  Would be a bit different of a situation if I'd studied CS no?  Not to say I don't understand what you are saying, but you have to see it from my perspective.  I don't want to be nomadic traveling around SEA continuously or have a fancy job with a fancy car, just want to be in Europe.  If I'd studied CS I could be living in the Czech, Romania or who knows where right now."

I think it's important to know what the locals think of the area, and not so much statistics about it. A lot of times the hippest and most popular places are the ones with higher than average crime rates.   If people could tag a neighborhood as family friendly, touristy, quiet, hipstery, etc, that would give a great impression of what to expect in that area. I think tags in this case are better than filters because many neighborhoods can have more than one ""vibe"", and a lot of times they would be oddly conflicting. For example, where I live is quiet and full of families but it's also 1 block away from the waterfront where everyone parties in the summer.   Also, some basic idea of cost of living in that area. Don't need exact numbers, just a general ""expensive"", ""students"", ""low income"", ""working class"" etc."

You'll also have to keep in mind that salaries in Germany are most likely going to be much lower than you are used to(if you have worked before)  But yes 7-10k would be enough to get started but it will be really hard for you to find a job without German. You could get lucky and try to find some entry level office job that is in English but those jobs are being sucked up by all other EU citizens also.   I actually have had a bunch of friends who only speak English and have EU passports try to go to Berlin and find a job and they all came back empty handed. There are just so many young people in Berlin trying to do exactly what you are.  I'm sure if you lived in a touristy city you could find a job at a bar or at a hostel if that is your kind of thing...otherwise it would just be a matter of luck if you'll find a job or not. A good thing to do is the second you land just start networking talk to people see what theyre doing see if they need an extra hand...I came to Europe without a EU passport and I found a job all in English in an office just by networking..I hope it can work for you too!

There are huge enclaves of ethnic indians, meaning you can get the same food, same entertainment as back home, and you can walk around for days and not even hear a word of english.  There are well established groups within several key companies that will funnel people of indian descent into good, well paying jobs (incl. rogers, bell, the banks, and government).  But here is where it gets tricky.  You'll be giving up a high standard of living to come to a country that doesnt recognize foreign experience or credentials.  You'll be entering pretty low on the totem pole of social credibility within your ethnic community, nor will you be escaping caste or tribal fiefdoms issues when you come here as they are all well established.    Compounding issues is the extremely high cost of living in most urban centres that have large indo-canadian populations (BC, ON), and its unlikely that you'll be able to maintain the standard of living that you've come to appreciate.  Your wife would probably need start working, which means you'll be paying daycare (1 to 2k CAD per month at least), and with taxes, you'll need to find a job that pays close to 90k just to reach the same amount of money you are saving now.  Its been said that almost 100k indians come to canada each year, which means competition to get those high paying visible minority quota jobs will be pretty tough."

Keep in mind that while you may make 2x the money, your costs might also blow up.  Look at property prices in Vancouver.  And although Canada can be nice during the warmer months, it sucks during the winter.  Imagine freezing your butt off everyday to leave for work before it is even light outside and going home when it is already dark outside.  It is a terrible lifestyle for most people.    It sounds like you are at a level where you might step up to foreign contracting, starting your own outsourcing firm...  The benefits of Canada will be harder to quantify.

I was just living there and had to move back because I could not get a visa, and have done a TON of research. The UK government has made it super tough for anyone outside the EU. You can study there and get a part-time work permit but as soon as the student visa is done, you will likely have to leave. I had a friend who actually did get a finance job there with a work permit, but he knew someone very high up. It costs them £5000 to sponsor you per year and they also have to prove to the UK government that your position cannot be filled by a UK or EU citizen.

I don't know anybody who managed to get a job within that 4 months period, so yeah, most people would have to leave at the end of their studies.  I remember reading that around 5000 tier 2 visa were granted for those who transitioned from the tier 4 student visa in 2013 (can't be bothered to find the source now) but that's 5000 out of the ~ 100k non-EU students who came to study in the UK in that year..

IWantOut,3cggjf,mathidiot,6,Tue Jul 7 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of civilian jobs on army bases, but my understanding is that they are also very competitive. usajobs.gov is the place to look for that. I got 7 hits for nurse in Germany (though many of them listed multiple locations, so it's possible that there are several openings near you).  It's possible that she could join the army too, but I would strongly discourage that route since (as far as I understand) it will be difficult to guarantee that she'll stay at that exact base, and she could get transferred or something else. Of course, if she's good and the army wants her it might not be so bad, but I've heard horror stories from vets who didn't play politics right and got transferred somewhere after their term on the base was up.  Would you make enough money to pay for both of you to live there? You could get married and support her if that's in the cards, but I don't know how serious the relationship is. She could become a nurse there but she'd need to learn German and probably go back to school to retrain a bit and rely off you in the mean time.  In general, my advice would be to get there, get settled and have her cash in a bunch of vacation days/unpaid leave/etc. to visit you and for her to see how she likes it and if she'd be happy over there and where you want to go. Then you can work on further solutions and hopefully not be long distance for longer than half a year or so. Moving overseas is a big change though (you might also find that you hate it), and having her do something like join the army when you aren't sure if you'll still be at the company (or want to be in Germany) for as long as she is in the armed forces is drastic.  How old is she? If she's under 26 then she could also aupair (assuming she doesn't mind children). If you shop around it's possible to find a family that would agree to a 6 month contract and that wouldn't mind if she is a live-out aupair (i.e. could live with you). This would give her some time to try and find something there and also see if living in Germany is something that would be good for her."
IWantOut,3cggjf,ikannfrancais,3,Tue Jul 7 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"One other thought: if you don't want to get married, but don't mind supporting her financially (or she has a lot saved up or rich/generous parents), then she could come over and get a language learning visa. This is a visa that basically lets her stay in the country to take a language course. It's not uncommon for people to do that for 6 months or a year (enough time to get their German to a decent level) and then go to university. Since she's already studied nursing and has a bachelors she shoudl be in better shape, but she'll likely need to return to school in order to work as a nurse in Germany. I don't know how many years that will take (you might ask around on other subs or if you know anyone over there).  The other advantage of this is that it gives her a chances to see the country and decide if it's for her and the commitment itself isn't that high (she would have to give up her job, but she could in principle fly home whenever she wants).  Also: in case it isn't obvious from my reply (since others have said something similar), I would strongly discourage joining any branch of the armed forces.

I mean could you imagine a nurse taking care of patients who couldn't speak with them or at only such a basic level that most things couldn't be conveyed?  She'll also need to get licensed there, but I think it'd largely be a matter of paperwork and having her education evaluated.  And I'm not surprised at all that it's tough to get those US army jobs in Germany like /u/Punica talks about.  USAjobs is the place to go, however note that for all federal jobs, #1 priority is veterans, #2 priority is current or former federal employees, #3 priority is everyone else.  This is practically regardless of actual skill set - I had a very tough time getting hired originally for one of my past federal jobs as an engineer with experience in battery testing simply because there was a veteran in the database with absolutely no battery experience.  And Germany is definitely the most desired foreign base location.  Also just be aware with USAjobs...expect a slow slow slooooooooow process.    Sooo how about marriage or a civil union?

If she doesn't, she will have no chance of working in her field (or at all), unless you get extremely lucky with the Army base.   I lived in Germany for a couple of years and let me tell you something, it is incredibly difficult to find a job in Germany with no German language skills. I even have intermediate German skills and I still found it difficult, impossible really.   I lived in a city with a huge Army base, and I figured I could get a job washing dishes or at a fast food restaurant, but I couldn't even get into the base to speak with anyone about getting a job. I applied a million times at usajobs.gov, and I never received a single reply. I tried calling and emailing and also never received a response. Those jobs are actually pretty hard to get, especially for nurses I assume, and if you don't know anybody living on base then she probably won't have a shot at getting hired. Also, I talked to my friend in the Army to see if it was a smart decision to join the Army and try to live on the base, and he said that the Germany bases are the hardest to get in to because they are so nice, and American wives would rather relocate their families to Germany than most other countries (Korea, Japan, etc). He told me if I had joined the Army then I would have been sent to Afghanistan in a couple of months, even though the Army recruiter told me that I could definitely live in Germany (everything the recruiter told me was a lie, according to my Army friend)  It's not the same for everyone, but I applied for literally THOUSANDS of jobs in Germany and didn't get anything. I have a BA, and I was getting turned down for jobs at Burger King and scrubbing toilets at the airport. I had my resume looked at, I took classes, I did literally everything I could think of to try and get a job and nothing worked. After 1 1/2 years I finally had to move back to America, defeated and hating myself for failing so badly.  I am not trying to scare you, but I just want to let you know that it is no cakewalk finding a job in Germany. Unless she is very lucky, it will be difficult for her to find anything. The best shot your girlfriend has to find a job is to get a TESOL (teaching english as a second language) certification and teach english, or to be an au-pair nanny because some families prefer an english speaking nanny to teach their children.   I think the advice that /u/ikannfrancais gave is pretty solid, have her come out and visit you to see if she actually likes it first. I moved from the USA to Germany and it was shocking. It was so difficult to not only find a job, but to find any people to relate to. German people are ice cold and unfriendly (in general) to the point where they will practically run away from you if you ask them a question on the street.

Do never hesitate to apply to a position you (or your girlfriend) are interested in.  Most employers rewuire a minimum amount of german, but thats alright.

IWantOut,3cggjf,isuckatpasswordsso,3,Thu Jul 9 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Was almost in the same boat in the middle of 2013.  My company also offered me a position in Germany (Cologne) and offered to relocate me and my family over.  At the time, I was living in the US with my long-term girlfriend who had a job in a field that wasn't too common in Germany -- university financial aid administration.  After a long discussion, we decided that I'd take the job and she would join me.  The easiest thing we did to smooth out the transition was getting married.  Germany doesn't recognize girlfriend/boyfriend or opposite-sex domestic partnerships and your gf will need a visa if she wants to stay longer than 90 days.  She could, theoretically, come over and try to find a job in those 90 days but this will be damn-near impossible, even with nursing experience.  The reason is, Germany requires all nurses to be certified per German/EU standards so having her find a job in 90 days to get a visa as a non-German-speaking, American taught nurse will not be possible.  I would also not bank on her finding anything on the army base as this will be equally as hard as others have stated.  So get married and, assuming you're coming on the Blue Card, she will get the stay and work allowance here for as long as you have it.  What my wife did when we first got here was enroll in an Integration Course.  The foreigners office gave her the choice of whether she wanted to take it or not (although I think the rules have since changed and now everyone must take it) and it was the best decision we could have made.  600 hours of German language courses, M-F for 6 months costing a total of 396€.  That took up the first 6 months of her stay and got her out of the house and meeting people.  After it was finished she got a job working through a temp agency for, coincidentally, my company.  It's not in her field, but it's a resume builder and again something to get her out of the house and working.  In your wife's case, maybe after the Integration Course is completed, she could look at a fast-track program to get her nursing credentials in Germany.  Becoming a nurse here, I believe, is not as hard as in the US.  You can see what exactly would be required and what is already recognized through this office -- http://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/html/en/  BTW-- congrats nonetheless.  Germany is a great place, but definitely not without its challenges for expats.  My tip is to give yourselves time to settle and put as much effort as you can to learning the language.  I've been here in my job that ""doesn't require German"" for 1.5 years now and not needing German here is a load of horsecrap.  It's a daily requirement in every aspect of life here and you will struggle with the most mundane things until you get a grasp of it.  Take it slow and make sure you have discussed all this thoroughly with your girlfriend.  It will be a huge change and expectations will have to be shifted tremendously to accommodate everything that will happen to you guys over the next few years.

IWantOut,3cdl8q,throwthrow0990,22,Tue Jul 7 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a hard decision but it is not, IMO.  Peace Corps is a legitimate credential, something you can put on your resume that actually commands some respect.  They have a legitimate selection process and they don't just take anyone.  When you tell people you did Peace Corps, in quite a few circles - at least around here in DC - it is considered a fairly legitimate achievement.  People will realize that you just came back from the boonies and doors will open much easier for you when you look to start your career.  Furthermore, given the history and magnitude of the program, you have a bit of a network built in that might be able to help or advise you in whatever you try to do.  On the flip side, TEFL English in China is not an achievement.  If you have a degree,  a US passport, and no criminal record, they will take -almost- any dummy that passes the photo test.  It is mostly a big hole in your resume and people who hire don't give it much credence. It is not a step up to anything bigger.  Heck, as a foreigner, you can't even daydream about opening up your own English school someday (you have to ""partner"" with a Chinese national.)  And China existence is basically a dead end - unless you marry someone, it is up to the bureaucrats each year to decide if they want to let you stay for one more year.  Maybe some Chinese special interest/trade group might value this, but overall, it's not a resume builder.   In terms of lifestyle, China wins hands down.  You probably won't even get stationed in a bigger city in Cameroon.  You will probably be in some very provincial area.  It's mostly drawbacks, but there are some benefits.  Chances are that you will build lifelong friendships and meet some fascinating expats.  The closest I've been to Cameroon is Angola... a completely different world, really.  But in my experience (South of DRC only), the foreigners you meet in random African countries are really fascinating.  Many could write books about their life stories.    Also keep in mind that you will get enough training and assistance to make your Cameroon life doable.  You are not on your own.  The only thing I would check is that Peace Corps staff is not under any heavy restrictions.  (In some countries, in some areas, you are stuck in your compound/etc.)   Bottom line is that this Peace Corps opportunity will probably not come up again.  It sounds like you're young, you have time to do it.  Do it.    Teaching English in China?  You can do that anytime you wish when you get sick of whatever you are doing in the US.  The only good reason to pick China right now is if you are trying to do something else in China.  (Start exporting something, and using the TEFL day job to fund your stay for a while.)  I do realize that Beijing might seem like a big metropolitan area whereas Cameroon might seem like the ""Heart of Darkness.""  Especially if this is your first big trip, China is going to sound a lot easier.  But I'm pretty sure you will do just fine in Cameroon as well.  Your biggest battle might be fending off boredom in the country side."

It seems the one you are more interested in. It is a shorter contract so you always visit Africa or travel somewhere else after. China is the world's largest economy and will continue to be of more importance as time goes on, and having experience of it will be an asset when you go back home, which is not true to anywhere near the same extent for Cameroon. Money isn't everything, sure, but having a bit of cash at the end will allow you to do more after.   Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions."

Although Peace Corps pays, I think you'll have better chances to make decent money as a ESL teacher in China.   Don't get me wrong, Peace Corps is a good opportunity, but this is definitely not the type of opportunities I'd want to hesitate for. It's a 27-month contract if I am not mistaken so you gotta want this more than anything. I have always wanted to do Peace Corps but the fact that you have to commit for so long has always deterred me as you have to be more than ready.   Reading your post, China seems to be the winner."

If in 2 years or in 10 years you still want to teach English in China, trust me, you'll have no trouble finding work. Also, I have lived in Beijing, it was probably my worst experience ever. Imagine the most crowded city possible. Then double the population density. So much pollution that you can't even see any blue in the sky on a clear day. Oh and Beijing locals really like to spit for some reason, and are not the most polite.   I've never been to Cameroon, but I have traveled a lot in Africa and I met a few Peace Corps folks there.

But if there's any chance at all that you think you could have a fulfilling experience, go with the Peace Corps. Everyone and anyone who graduates college is going over to East Asia to teach English, it doesn't mean anything unless you want to stay there. Choosing China just because it pays and you have ""more interest in going"" is short-sighted. If you have another reason for going, like you have an opening at a business corporation and they could use someone with Chinese expertise and language experience, that's a different story.   The Peace Corps offers significantly more perks/benefits upon returning from whatever country you were in, the least of which is a fascinating interview story. You'd be doing good work there. There's also the network, the resume boost of the highly competitive application process, the name recognition...if you don't know what you want to do long-term, and aren't already on a career track, do the Peace Corps, have an amazing and character-building experience, and come back in two years as a new person."

If you are only considering Peace Corps for the after benefits don't bother they are actually pretty hard to qualify for and are highly competitive.    Some background on Cameroon: it is a country that has been forgotten about by outside investment.  There are no McDonalds, Starbucks, or even European chains in the country.  It is a true Peace Corps experience.  It will be something that will deeply affect you for better or worse, but for me was universally a positive experience.

I have a friend who taught English in China, learned how to speak and write Chinese, and now holds a lucrative corporate position as some kind of international liaison.  If you see a future with frequent communication with the Chinese, go with that one.  Knowing Chinese etiquette and speaking the language will open doors for you considering the amount of trade we do with their country.  However, just going to China and returning without picking up their language means you should scratch this one off the list, because being a teacher alone won't get you far (if anywhere.)  If you're more of a creative person who does not want to have a formal position, go with Cameroon.  Non-profits and laid back industries will eat up the Peace Corps being on your resume.  Many companies who hire traveling consultants will also hire people who have been in the Peace Corps because that kind of rough experience tells the employers that you'll be willing to put up with the stress of travel and you're level-headed/ethical enough to put clients #1.  I work in finance and my employers would have tossed my resume if it included the Peace Corps because they'd see it as a waste of time when I could have been interning instead, but industries that are less uptight and more open to well-rounded individuals would value your volunteer experience."

Why?  1) Public transpo... yeah okay, it's not THE best, but if you need to zip around, the busses are regular, we have the light rail, and honestly, you can walk to most places IF you live in the city.  Also, we have bikes that you can rent spread out throughout the city, and zip/minute/go cars here and there if you're in a pinch.  Both Uber and Lyft have a strong presence here and are not yet heavily regulated, and our cabs are honestly not too bad (although it's still a bit of a rip off.)  2) Bicycle friendly?  Fuck yes we're bicycle friendly!  We beat out Portland, OR for the most bike friendly city in the US and were recently voted as the ONLY US city to be listed in the top 100 biking cities in the world.  Tons of paths, the Greenway, and a ton of bike boulevards.  I live in the heart of Uptown and have put 500 miles on my car since January, most of which came from a 260 mile trip I did earlier this week.  I bike pretty much everywhere.  School, errands, seeing friends: all done via bike.  It's great.    3) Authentic Chinese?  Well, not really... we have a HUGE Hmong population, the second largest in the US.  As such, we have a ton of Hmong restaurants, as well as Thai and Vietnamese.  Real Chinese cooking can be tough to find, although there is a decent smattering of Cantonese food here and there (so says one of my friends who is back from China after 5 years, and his Chinese wife.)  4) Diverse population?  Hell yes we have a diverse population.  As I mentioned before, huge Hmong population, but we also have a ton of folks from India, Ethiopia, Liberia, Somalia, Mexico (straight up I-35 baby) and others.  Get out in the suburbs, and yes, you'll find the WASPs, but in the city, mad diversity yo.  Mad diversity.  5) Nature?  Fuck yes we have that.  I can get to 6 lakes from my apartment within 20 minutes by bike, and about 30 by car in the same time span.  Minneapolis AND Saint Paul were voted for #1 and #2 in a recent contest for best city parks.  I have 3 parks within 10 blocks of me, and there a ton of activities.  Whether you want to stroll around the lake, catch a free movie on movie in the parks night, or even go boating/fishing/swimming, we've got that.  Furthermore, you're only 3-4 hours from one the largest, and most visited wildernesses in the US (the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.)  Past that, we have a ton of state parks, and other offerings.  Minnesotans love being outdoors when we can.  6)  As far as weather?  Summer rocks, winter can suck... I mean... it's Minnesota.  Honestly, I LOVE this city.  Not many places can you go out at 3 AM, ride around a lake, go downtown, get some snacks, and then hang out until the sun rises without anyone hassling you.  Seriously.  Minneapolis is the shit.

One of the things I noticed while I was there (a few years back, so it might be better now) was that most of the diversity there was due to recent immigrants (Hmong, Somali, Mexican, etc.) who tend to stick to their own communities. There's nothing wrong with that, and I've definitely been guilty of that myself at times as an expat, but I feel like it would be difficult to have a social circle with different backgrounds and experiences represented. What has your experience been?  (Basically, I know a lot of white people whose idea of ""diversity"" is going to a Thai restaurant on Friday night with their group of white friends. Not saying everyone in Minneapolis is like that, but that's the kind of the trap I want to avoid falling into, if that makes sense.)"

That being said, it's not really like the communities are segregated, and I think it really is up to you to decide what you want to be involved in.  I take the whole diverse experiences approach and have been invited to quinceaneras, Holi and Divali festivals, Hmong celebrations, and Ethiopian New Years celebrations.  If you become friends with people, you'll get invites; there are also a TON of public events that are posted around.  The nice thing about Minnesota is, despite the whole joke about Minnesota nice, we tend to be very inviting of others to events (church basement potlucks being the stereotype.)  I think that habit tends to transfer to immigrants and the newer generations.  At this point, as long as you're open to new experiences and make it clear you're not afraid of leaving your comfort zone, you'll get invites.  I WILL admit, I come from a slightly biased background though.  I'm as white as they come, but I have a number of Indians in my family, grew up in a very diverse neighborhood, and have always been a bit gregarious.

I would suggest picking a place with a lower cost of living, because $8,000 is not a lot of savings, and you'll have to do the minimum wage thing for a bit until you retrain or network your way into a career track position.  If you are dead set on a tier 1 American city, consider sticking it out in China for another year and get those savings up to at least $25,000 so you have a cushion while getting back on your feet."

IWantOut,3ccvag,Unturned1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:05:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, congrats! I'll be attending a uni just down the road (Heriot Watt) for my masters this year too.  I used to work with international students and the biggest thing I would be worried about would be your CAS letter from UoEdinburgh and your Tier 4 visa. It's normally a pretty smooth process but it's best to get to know the Universities studuent advice team if you do have any problems. A bonus to your student visa is that you can work part time  which, if you can find work in the area your studying, is a huge benefit.  Edinburgh is on the expensive side for a city in the UK (nowhere near as expensive as London) so you should think about budgets. Your university has a pretty good breakdown of living costs here and I would try and put yourself in the middle of the costs that they propose.   Lastly, the weather. It's milder than New Jersey (from what I can see on average temps so you probably won't need your cosiest winter clothes or barest summer clothes, but it is pretty humid most of the year so it can feel colder or warmer than it is.

You need to determine where you want to live and what you're going to do once you get there. Leaving France to go to England will be easier than relocating to, say, Canada and the process will be much different. What kind of jobs are you looking for? Any degrees? Do you want to live in an English-speaking country or remain in a French environment or both?

Eugene is kinda the hippieland of Oregon whereas Corvallis is more small town America, so do with that what you will. I haven't lived in Corvallis so I'm not as sure, but I think they're both bike friendly cities and pedestrian friendly. The benefits of these towns is that the ""inner city"" is very small and everything you need is within walking distance. Portland is kinda yes and no - there are places you can live in (like St Johns, Sellwood, Alberta) that are really insular and community-oriented, but there are neighborhoods that are really far from everything and do require some mode of transportation.  Another thing about Portland, Seattle, or San Francisco - you will probably need a job lined up there BEFORE you move there. It's not a necessity but it would make the transition like a zillion times easier. Whereas in a smaller city I think you'd have a better experience moving there without a job and finding one after you're settled."

IWantOut,3cbywz,pinkgreenblue,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"This is not entirely correct information.  A permanent resident can go abroad for at least 6 months, and as long as 1 year so long as they provide evidence that it's only intended as a temporary absence.  However special care needs to be taken if all that OP has is a temporary stamp and hasn't received the physical card yet.    http://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/maintaining-permanent-residence  Up to 6 months with the physical card is no problem at all, OP doesn't need need to do anything.  Between 6 months to 1 year, one can apply for readmission at the point of entry when returning.  There's additionally a reentry permit that can be applied for with an up to 2 year absence, if a good enough reason can be provided for the absence.  http://www.immihelp.com/greencard/retain-greencard.html  Also if OP is actually going back to the US at least once every 6 months, it is possible to maintain permanent residency for much longer periods of time.  But he/she should look very long and hard at the details of how to do this properly."
IWantOut,3cbywz,pyridine,2,Tue Jul 7 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"Great point. I replied to another one of OP's posts.  I'll note that there is a big misconception that a green card holder just has to come stateside for a day every six months to ""reset"" the clock yet this all comes down to the discretion of the CBP immigration officer (border control) each and every time you re-enter the U.S. I think it's extremely unlikely someone could spend a majority of time abroad without a re-entry permit and expect to maintain residency. Especially when it comes time to remove the conditions on the green card, renew the green card, and/or apply for citizenship. USCIS will want to see proof of (continuous) residency."
IWantOut,3cbywz,pinkgreenblue,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:26:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I do know someone working and residing here for the past 4 years who has been maintaining his green card that way and he always complains about it, actually not sure if he's given up yet.  As long as you follow the guidelines in the unofficial link about retaining the green card (see section ""Extended stay outside the US""), you can in theory do it.  Yes it is certainly risky that you could always lose it, and many people could not actually do all of these things.    I would never recommend doing this on only a conditional green card, that would be silly.  As for renewal, you can see that the renewal form is a pretty basic form, so I don't think any issues would be encountered there so long as you fill it out with your US address that you've been maintaining.  As for citizenship, I don't know the exact requirements but you don't NEED to ever apply for citizenship - you can be a perpetual permanent resident for the rest of your life."

You go to the back of the line so depending on how you originally were sponsored (through spouse, parent, sibling, et cetera), you can expect it to take about that long again.  I'll add that other commenters have correctly pointed out the rules regarding re-entry permits (for permission to be abroad up to two years) and the ability of an LPR (legal permanent resident, AKA green card holder) to go abroad for up to a year (and what happens if you come back before a year but after six months). The info provided by them is correct and worth factoring in. In my mind, if you keep coming back but spend more than half of your time out of the country, at some point a CBP immigration officer is going to ask you questions and deem your residency abandoned or parole you into the country (let you in but tell you you can't keep going out).  I'm not an immigration expert and I invite others to critique this post. Your main concern right now should be studying the reasons USCIS issues re-entry permits and see if/how you can qualify."

IWantOut,3cb329,Ukjobtemp,2,Mon Jul 6 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you about my experience although YMMV.  Before you leave:   Your country should have an EU healthcare insurance card. Get it issued to you. It looks like this and you can probably just go down to your healthcare service and ask for it or just call them. I got it just calling the provided number and it was mailed to my house.   It should be free or very cheap and it provides health coverage in case something bad happens and you're in a jam.   Make sure your ID is up-to-date.   Consulates and what not in London are extremely busy and shit takes long. My ID card (biometric chip) usually takes 1~3 days to be issued in my native country. Took 3 months between getting an appointment and receiving it at home (London).   If you can afford/have time, get your passport issued.    Our (EU) IDs are valid everywhere and for everything but some companies and banks are quite annoying and it gets old having to say ""I have an EU ID. Is that alright?"" and waiting for the inevitable sigh followed by ""yeah I guess that should work"".  After you're in London:   NI number.    Call to make an appointment (usually 1w wait) and then you'll have to go down there, talk to some dude, they'll copy your id/passport and you'll be set. It'll probably be mailed to you within 2~3 weeks and you can work in the mean time in my experience.   Proof of address/Bank account.    This one can be a pain. Some banks want proof of address for a bank account and of course, jobs require bank accounts so they can pay you and to rent people will want you to have a job+deposit transfer, etc so you see the circular logic. If you share a flat, you can probably use the NI letter as proof of address. Also if your ID is expiring soon, you can't open a bank account. I think it has to have >30d left or something like it.  Otherwise, you can also buy a simcard on contract/monthly invoice and have that work as proof of address or get a simcard frm a company like giffgaff or w/e that sends simcards through the post.   Register with your local NHS center.    Seems you need to be registered with an NHS center to be able to do normal walk-in emergency appointments. I do not know if all emergencies work like this but it's better to be on the safe side.   Oyster card.    Pretty sure you've read about it. Get one, inform yourself on the routes you take and what's cheaper. Unlike many other places, the longer paid period (1mo, 3mo, 6mo, etc) is not always the cheapest/sensible option and sometimes straight up a top up of 15 or 20 pounds ends up cheaper than paying a flat fee.   e: I forgot. After you have your house/flatshare/cardboard box/RV set up and everything is more or less trivial in your life, go register with your consulate.    This allows you to vote (most of the eu countries at least) and makes sure in case something bad happens, the consulate can notify your family and what not. Also abbreviates the process of renewing any identification documents.  Honestly those were probably the things I felt more difficulty in. The rest is pretty straightforward.  Oh, I assume you have a cellphone. Google maps or London City Mapper (imo runs better on slower phones and is less battery intensive)  are awesome for public transportation. They can plot routes, have the times and prices.  e: another tidbit. Bank cards in the UK generally have the account number and sort code printed on them.  With these two numbers, your name and address it is possible (although unlikely) for bad things to happen. Because of this, you should be extra careful with your bank cards - even if just debit."

Now, it isn't Russia and mentality of Russians here is a bit different from the ones in Russia, but it's got the best of both worlds -- it's EU with no over-the-top ridiculous laws and it's close to Russia, so you could travel there before making your final decision and you could communicate with people here.

I don't really see a geographical or cultural thread between them outside of maybe far right movements?  You can easily move to Thailand to teach English and if you get a degree you could likely do the same for Japan. I know that there are westerners teaching English in Russia, but I am not sure if they are American and I imagine that the person would need a degree. It might be a good idea for you to go and live in one of these places for a year to test out whether you want to live there (and certainly if you would want to join one of their militaries!).  EDIT: I'll add this link, though I don't know if it's accurate or not:   Russia - Years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, Russia remains very high on the list for countries in need of English language instructors. The demand for teachers is so strong here that you can be hired to teach English in Russia without a college degree relatively easily. Russia’s size alone- a population of 140 million spead throughout the largest country in the world, spanning nine time zones- predicts a wealth of employment opportunities. Russians make up for cold winters with their warm hospitality, good humor, and bracing shots of vodka. Moscow and St. Petersburg are two of the best places to start looking for work teaching English, but opportunities can be found throughout this vast nation. It's not uncommon to find work in a language school that will not only pay for your accommodations, but also your visa costs, return airfare and transportation."

The world super powers are draining their economies into exhaustion, that's how they become super powers. Russia is in the top 4 in terms of military spending, but are they anywhere near in terms of the GDP? All of that money for the military, sports, showing off, etc. has to come from somewhere. For you, Russia being a super power means that Putin would have more power over you, and you would be paying more of your income to him.  What I would do, is I would pick a small country, with low military spending to GDP (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Israel, Russia, and the United States do not qualify), low prisoner per capita (the US, Cuba, Russia, and Thailand do not qualify), without any major calamities going on right now in the economy, in particular, without too much debt (Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Japan do not qualify). There are lots of places in Europe, Asia and South America which fit those criteria. From Cambodia to Singapore, from Estonia to Iceland. Many of them should be a better choice than Russia.

In order for loss of nationality to occur under Section 349(a)(1), it must be established that the naturalization was obtained with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship. Such an intention may be shown by a person's statements or conduct. If the U.S. Government is unable to prove that the person had such an intention when applying for and obtaining the foreign citizenship, the person will have both nationalities.

Here's how teacher positions on a pre-college level in North America and Europe are filled: lots of applicants that went for the only college degree they could handle, applying for job in a monopsony market (the public schools dominate the education market). In monopsonies, the employer can drive down the wages because the job applicants have very few other job options. You'll make about the same as working restaurants, except the restaurants don't require a college diploma and there's actually a potential for career improvements in the restaurant business.  Add to that, teaching is a licensed profession in many European countries. This means that if you get an American teacher degree, you'll still have to spend 3-5 more years in say, Swedish college, before you could legally teach in a Swedish school.  Most animation and 3D modeling is off-shored or near-shored to countries like South Korea, Malaysia, or today maybe Ukraine or Romania. Check the end-titles on some childrens' tv shows and you'll get what I mean. These animators have bachelors or masters degrees in animation and usually three or more years of experience in the business. In addition to English, they are also fluent in one or two other languages, which is useful since team management is done in the local language. And they'll happily work ten hours per day for $1,000 per month.  A couple of advices for you:   Don't go into debt for a degree that doesn't garner the extra pay. If you want to move to Europe, study in Europe! That way you can try it out, it's ok if you don't find any jobs directly, it's cheaper than your US colleges and if it doesn't pan out you'll still have some nice stories for parties about ""your year abroad"". If you get a degree in Europe, it's probably much more likely to prepare you for working in Europe and you'll have some time to pick up the local street skills and/or language, than if you study in US. Consider taking some single classes or a one or two-year diploma. 3D modelling is much more a craft than something you'll learn while taking mandatory US history or whatever the college have chosen for you. Picking up some animation classes can be useful on your CV and be something you do on the side while you practice and develop your craft. But as animator, you'll be judged on your practical skills. Consider getting into software development. This is an international field and you'll actually make back what you took out in student loans. A bachelors in software development is enough to get a job in Europe. You can still combine it with modelling or animation, if you take some game dev or 3D graphics courses."

He said tell them I resigned for medical reasons and dont say anything bad about the district and nobody will care what happened.

If you have your heart set on Europe that obviously narrows the number of jobs you could apply for but there are still many openings. After graduation with a teaching degree or a subject degree and a teaching certificate I would advise you to teach either at home, or get a job in the UAE or China (the two largest markets for international schools on earth) for a couple of years (2-5). Once you have that experience you would be much more likely to get a job in Europe.  Salary for teaching at international schools  varies by level of school and the location, but expect between 40-80K USD at a good school with housing and flights covered (some European don't include this, but may pay more.)"

Hiring practices in Scandinavia are incredibly conservative (it can be quite difficult to fire someone and the cost of labor is high) and people usually hire people they already know as a result, unless they're so desperate that they can't find anyone to fill the position that they know.  Sure qualifications can vary, but it's usually incredibly difficult even for people already living in Sweden for years (e.g. spouses of people who go over with one job offer) to find work.

To travel overseas as an Australian (not including New Zealand) it costs an incredible amount for the airfare alone, mainly because we are so far away from everywhere else. It takes the same amount of time to fly from Dublin to New York City as it does to fly from the east coast to the west coast of Australia.   On top of that the Australian dollar is generally going to be at a worse exchange rate for every other currency in a developed country - 1aud = 0.8us, 1aud = 0.5gbp, 1aud = 75yen.  And the article just rings true for me personally, if only because every single one of my friends who went back packing across Europe came back not only after draining their bank account, but also maxing out their credit card ""for emergency purposes only"".

I spent the last year and a half I was finishing college simultaneously getting all kinds of certifications to get a very blue collar job that would enable me to work crazy overtime and get hazard pay so I could work for six months and then travel.  The summer I graduated I worked about 700 hours of overtime and more than 1000 hours of hazard pay. I then left that job (it was seasonal) with about $30k in the bank and went and traveled for the better part of a year.  Even though I came back to the recession and had a very hard time finding a job, I do think that the experience I had was worth it, and somehow it paid off into my current job, where my company really values my comfort level traveling solo to foreign countries.  I've got a reputation as someone who lives to travel and can figure everything out on my own, so I get sent around the world for my company.   I'm about two years behind in my career compared to if I hadn't taken the time off to go work this other jib and go traveling. Maybe I'd be in a slightly better financial position if I hadn't traveled for the better part of a year, maybe not. The experience with the job I had that enabled me to save up to travel and the traveling I took part in has actually opened doors.   I'm now 29 years old working for a company I like making a six figure salary and I have managed to save more than $100k. I travel all the time for work, which I love. I'm headed to Shanghai next Sunday, and then after my work trip there I'm taking some personal time to go to Cambodia and Beijing. I've got other international trips lined up for later in the year as well.  I met a lot of young people from all over the world while I was traveling who have either visited me here in the US or who I have visited abroad. Those connections really enriched my life. Most turned out really well and now have great careers, despite a few fairy pixie dream girls who are perpetually in useless grad programs around the world, but most of those fpdgs have trust funds and very wealthy parents.  My advice is definitely travel, but do it right and don't go into debt to travel and also get some kind of relevant experience before you do what I did. It was very hard to come back and break into the business world without having some internships on my resume. It worked out for me, but I did get kinda lucky."

IWantOut,3c3b5w,thatcantb,61,Sat Jul 4 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"This just popped up on my facebook feed, and I'll just place the same thoughts here that i put there:   Wow. I just read this exact same article in TIME (http://time.com/3943637/money-travel-advice/). Chelsea Fagan is a financial blogger, so her motivations for writing this piece are probably along the lines of her own relevant interests, and that's fine. Unfortunately, I can't say that I agree with her very much here. There are definitely a few points here that i totally, 100%, completely agree with: First, that ""nothing about your ability or inability to travel means anything about you as a person."" Bang-on. I spent more time than i can remember DREAMING about traveling when i was unable to do so for one reason or another -- too young, too poor, no vacation time, couldn't afford a passport, you fucking name it. Second, I agree that ""traveling for the sake of travel is not... guaranteed to make anyone a more cultured, nuanced person."" I will absolutely buy that, sure. We all know people who have been all over the place who are still uptight douchbags.   But Seriously, ""Don't worry about money, just travel"" is clearly not the worst advice of all time. I don't know what that advice is, but it's probably something much more sinister. Look, maybe i'm the edge-case. I'm that guy mentioned in this article -- I ""post[s] superficially inspiring quotes on [...]lush photos, about dropping everything and running away, or quitting that job you hate to start a new life somewhere new, or soaking up the beauty of the world while you are young and untethered enough to do so."" And even as a college drop-out working a shitty minimum-wage full-time job with 5 years worth of defaulted private-college loans, I managed to find time -- and money -- to travel, because travel was my conscious priority. Shit, eventually i found enough time and money to ""quit that job [I] hate to start a new life somewhere new, soaking up the beauty of the world while you are young and untethered enough to do so."" I'm actually a little offended that the author is putting up the viewpoint that ""[travel is] a way for the upper classes to pat themselves on the back for being able to do something that, quite literally, anyone with money can buy"" and ""They are learning what it means to work hard, to delay gratification, and to better yourself in slow, small ways.""   Insinuating that travel is a luxury only reserved for the affluent, or that no one who travels works hard, or that people who can't travel work harder than those who do is nothing more than ludicrous. I worked my balls off for many years at near-minimum wage to get exactly where I am now. Again, because I made travel a conscious priroity. I love to travel -- I feel the experience fulfills me in ways that money, or investment, or financial security cannot. And If that's my perogative, Who the fuck is Chelsea Fagan to tell me i made the wrong decision? Do i own a home? no. Do i own a car? no. Do i have a stock portfoio? no. Look, as someone who came from next-to-nothing, I realized very early on that when i'm old and senile, i'm not going to give a FUCK about how much money i have in the bank, what stocks i own, How nice my house is, or how many cars i have. I'm going to care about the experiences I had, the things I saw, the people I met, and the life I lived.   I also think that, more broadly, Fagan's viewpoint is a uniquely american one, at least in regards to International travel (which i think is her main focus here). Living in the states, we all realize that it's fucking expensive to get to other countries. The USA is huge, distances are vast, and paid time off is very little. One of the reasons we decided to drop everything and move to Europe is that travel here isn't really thought of as a luxury; it is just something people do. Distances are not so vast, travel is cheaper, and paid time off is really reasonable. I can pack bag at home in Amsterdam, book a $40 flight on a discount airline, and check into a cheap hostel in another city -- sometimes in two hours or less door to door (depending on the city of course).   I would never, ever deter anyone from investing or prioritizing financial security over travel -- If that's your perogative, who am I to judge? But to make an outright blanket statement like this is just silly.  /endrant"
IWantOut,3c3b5w,putin_on_the_sfw,29,Sat Jul 4 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"Americans are unique among developed well off nations in that you all do hardly travel at all. From an outsider perspective it seems that financially it's hard because things are far away (although I meet Canadians travelling all the time and it's that bit further for them) and your student loans and health insurance situation makes being in your 20s expensive. Also you get such little paid vacation.   On top of that though there seems to be a culture of fear of the unknown and the foreign. Mexico is a gorgeous country with so much going on, and so nearby, but many Americans seem convinced it's full of bandits, murderers and drug barons. And any time there is a post on here asking about moving away from the U.S. The overwhelming response is ""don't it'll go horribly wrong and you'll be sorry"". Not all Americans by any means, but there seems to be a higher proportion of that view."
IWantOut,3c3b5w,Blossomkill,7,Sat Jul 4 16:07:04 2015 UTC,"International travel is difficult for Canadians too.  The huge issue is vacation time. We don't get a lot of paid vacation, particularly Canadian youth. A lot of entry-level positions end up being contracts in a lot of fields and that means you don't get paid if you don't show up. I get 5 paid days off a year all of which are national holidays. Everything else I have by the grace of my employers who let me bank hours.  And, unfortunately for Canadians, shitty airline monopolies that make flying a big cost.  Another huge issue is that Canada is unfortunately massive with its big cities spanning a huge amount of space. A lot of young people - particularly those from shitty depressed areas - end up living far from home and spend most of their vacation time travelling home to see their parents. The number of young people from out of province in Alberta is mind-blowing for me.   I live in the shithole known as Alberta because it's literally the only place in the country hiring in my field. Holidays mean going home to see my folks in BC or Ontario to see my Gran and my friends.   Going to Mexico or France or Japan means time I'm not spending with my family. In the choice between travel and family it comes down to the simple fact that my parents are almost 60 and won't be here forever. I'd regret it if something horrible happened to them next year and I'd taken all my holidays to do the Inca trail instead of spending time with them.  I wish they lived closer and I could go by on long weekends or pop around after work. But that's reality living in a enormous country with a lumpy economy."

As an aside its contracting that lets me travel as much as I do, because I save and then take time between contracts but I do realise that's not realistic for everyone.

It also requires that you get comfortable at the very bottom, because that is the default state of all low-money travelers and to be honest, all people. Knowing how to survive by panhandlling, sleeping on the street, and so on is the basis on which greater comforts can be achieved without compromise. I know how to do that and therefore have a greater peace than many of the richest - they know that when the money runs out, they do not know how to survive. This way, I make money and work when I can, I make friends, I travel as a respected member of a number of communities of alternative peoples - sometimes not even alternative: I got a ride with an investment banker who let me stay in his mansion once!   /r/vagabond is a good place to start. Note also that those who present various ""but you can't do that""s here are usually jealous and without experience (or if with experience, without sensibility). You can do it. Anyone can do it.

Ugh. I see this argument all the time and it's total BS. Whenever anyone speaks about being a digital nomad or choosing to travel so many people hop on the ""MUST BE NICE TO BE RICH"" bandwagon. It's just another excuse. You don't need to be rich, you just need to prioritize travel over other luxuries in your life. Instead of going out to eat every day, you save for travel. Instead of owning a car or a home, you save for travel. Instead of buying gadgets, decorating your home, etc. you sell those belongings and use that money for travel. And so on and so forth adapted to whatever your personal situation may be.   That said I do recognize my own privilege. I do have a lovely, supportive family, who even though they think I'm a bit mental, I am able to stay with them when I visit during the holidays. That's great. But no, they aren't supporting me financially in any way other than that.  I also am an american citizen. This gives me many favorable visa agreements or visa exemptions with many nations. It also means I have no barriers or hurdles when applying to American jobs, which allow me to make money online while traveling. Obviously this is a great advantage. But the people who make these arguments never seem to be saying, ""Hey if you're from India it would be much harder for you."" Which would entirely be true. I've met plenty of travels from there or other nations who do have more hurdles. But that's not the argument here. Instead, they seem to be making some silver spoon argument aimed at westerners, furthering the stereotype that the average person can't choose location independence, despite wanting to. Which is absolutely wrong.   If someone wants the path of school -> stable career -> home -> family then more power to them. But enough trying to shove it down there throat and tell them they have no options. Life can be lived in so many different ways!!!"

IWantOut,3c3b5w,witoldc,2,Sat Jul 4 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, you have to prioritize.  But a lot of people who say it's about priorities point to small stuff, like ""eating out.""    In reality, no amount of saving on eating out is going to save me enough budget to sleep in comfort, instead of some dirty hostel with 6 people in the room and 20 year old beds with ratty mattresses.    That's my priority:  not staying in dumps, while posting pictures of the beach in my Facebook feed and pretending that I'm in luxury.  Another one of my priorities is a motorcycle.  In most of the world, this will cost $50-$150/day.  It adds up quick.  Travel does take a fair bit of money.  SE Asia is the cheapest in the world but even there, it takes a good $30/day to get a nice hotel room and another $30/day to get the cheapest motorcycle (not a scooter - a motorcycle).  That doesn't sound much, but it adds up to basically $2000/month, just for room and transportation.  And this is one of the cheapest and tourist friendly places in the world.  Good luck trying to find a nice and pleasant hotel room in most of Africa.  Of course you can discount all this and say that I'm simply not making enough sacrifices.  And sure, I could buy a plane ticket and stay in a tent and walk around for free for a few months and it will cost peanuts.  But I want to experience things, not live like a homeless person and sleep like a Mexican migrant worker.  I want to do paragliding.  I want to motorcycle.

But you can have a VERY nice apartment for $1,000 USD in most of Asia, if you're willing to stay a little while. You can literally BUY a motorcycle for $2k and resell it for the same. It's all about what you prioritize. Yeah if you want to be in a different city all of the time and are paying daily prices on renting a motorbike, it's going to cost you. If I wanted to be ferried around town in a helicopter, it's going to cost me. As you say, it's all about priorities. Of course you're not going to be able to afford a nice bike at an exorbitant rate by skipping the Super Size at McD's every Wednesday.   I just travelled for three years. Sometimes I stayed in REALLY shitty places, sometimes in REALLY nice places, sometimes in my decent apartment (my apartment in Asia was half the price and easily twice as good as my USA living setup). Sometimes I walked, sometimes I took horrible local buses, sometimes I ubered, sometimes I cruised around on a badass motorcycle.   I could have stayed only half as long if I did it with your budget. I'm glad I didn't: all of it beats the hell out of sitting in an office all day. But that may not be true for you. To each his own."
IWantOut,3c3b5w,witoldc,2,Sun Jul 5 03:58:33 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair point.  You can rent apartments cheap in some places.  I am still amazed how great a $100/month apartment in Bangkok can look.  You can rent them even cheaper if you sign a 12 month lease.  But at some point, is it travel if you're renting one apartment for months at a time?  It is... but it isn't.  It's more like temporarily moving somewhere.  It's a good experience.  But it also varies by country.  SEA is tourist heaven where it's stupidly easy to rent for a month or 3, which is why it is flooded with long term backpackers.  That's not the case in more developed countries.  In the US and other developed countries, they will require applications, credit checks, big deposits, and 12 month leases - for an unfurnished place.     You can literally BUY a motorcycle for $2k and resell it for the same.   In most countries you can't do shit on a tourist visa.  Buying a motorcycle also includes two big sticking points:  getting insurance and getting registration.  On a tourist visa? Usually impossible."

After the first week, i liked the place and the location, i asked the host if he would consider a longer-term stay.  He was more than happy to give me a discounted rate in exchange for the security that he would have the guaranteed income for three months.

If you're willing to fit the mold exactly, it's possible.    You're right that if someone is going to be doing it for years at a time, they need to adjust.  3-6 month leases in one city, buying a scooter, watching food expenses, etc.  Is someone signing a 12 month lease in London a traveler or a resident?  Perhaps the distinction doesn't matter...    I guess I'm talking more about medium sized trips 1-4 months.  Where you don't want to sign a lease and be stuck in one neighborhood.  Where you don't want to just eat the cheap street food and might want to eat expensive seafood and try random foods and restaurants.  And yes, some touristy things as well.  Single entrance to Victoria Falls is $30 - $50 for moonlight.  Ultralight flight over the Falls is $150ish.  Am I going to go to Rwanda and not pay $600+ to see the gorillas?  Or go to Nepal and stick to backpacker areas instead of going to, for example, Mustang region that costs $50/day just in permit fees?  A lot of these touristy things cost money.  I'm not just talking about ziplines.  I can skip the ziplines and I can skip the beach drinking.  But I can't skip some of these things - and the costs add up fast.    Obviously, if I wanted to I could hole up in a ~$100/month SEA apartments and get by for years.  I wouldn't be able to afford a lot of things that Bangkok has to offer, but I could get by.  Ironically enough, the longer young people stay in SEA, the more they end up spending from my observations.  Initially, the sacrifices don't seem like sacrifices.  The novelty value overshadows discomfort.  As time goes on, people end up moving up in their budgets (assuming that they're not broke.)  All the sudden, it doesn't feel as cheap as it used to.  Perhaps this is where I am; the novelty value no longer overshadows discomfort for me.    In the end, my goal is not to travel to travel and say that I can do it for 5 years.   My goal is to experience a lot of things, see a lot of things, try a lot of things.  I can't do that holed up in a $100/month Bangkok apartment, cooking my meals to save money.  That's not the sort of experience I want or aspire to.    You're right that some places are both amazing and cheap.  The places I stayed in in Kashmir and Ladakh were both cheap and pleasant and wonderful.  But most places are not like this.  Some are stupidly expensive, especially the developing countries where tourist infrastructure is weak."

Clearly you have a very specific idea of things you'd like to do, in some of the most expensive cities in the world, all while keeping a higher standard of living than most westerners. That's fine and all, but tearing other people down for not having your expensive tastes is utterly ridiculous.  Honestly, I'm hoping this is satire. Otherwise, telling someone that a furnished apartment with all western comforts is the equivalent of living like a homeless person is one of the most spoiled rotten statements I've ever greater on this site.

But I do want a clean room, with clean sheets, and a clean bathroom.  Additionally, in many places, this is damn expensive.  Am I going to go to Zimbabwe and not pay the $35-ish it takes to see the (retrospectively) crappy Rhode's Grave?  Or $50 for a moonlit view of the Victoria Falls?  And these are prices in Zimbabwe, one of the poorest countries on Earth.  They still know how to suck money out of foreigners and practice double pricing.    Yes, you can sign a 12 month lease and furnish your place somewhere.  But is that travel, or is that just living somewhere else for a year?  Typically, furnished = higher price, short-term rental = higher price.  Yes, I realize that I could hole up for years in a fairly pleasant $150/month apartment in Bangkok and cook my food to save money, but is that travel, or just living somewhere for a year?    I also try to avoid the most touristy places, which tend to be more price competitive.  The cheapest hotels in Zimbabwe are around Vic Falls.  If you go anywhere else, you won't see those low prices.  This is why SEA is so popular and full of budget travelers.  It's one of the few places on Earth where you can predictably get a pleasant room for $30/night - but that still adds up, doesn't it?  Add a $30/day motorcycle rental - a motorcycle, not a scooter - and you're up to $2000/month just for these 2 items.

Are there exceptions?  Sure.  I've stayed in some amazing places that cost less, but they are exceptions.  Especially in backpacker ghettos there are more budget options that don't completely suck.  But I would not consider my numbers to be lies.    Go ahead, please find me a motorcycle rental in SEA that you think is budget.  I'm all ears.  I'm talking about 500cc+ motorcycles - not scooters.  I'm not talking about Ducatis here.  The bikes I'm talking about, like Kawasaki ER-6, are considered the bottom end of the market in the USA/EU, not some luxury item.  I could never afford to rent BMWs at $130/day in Thailand.  And yes, sometimes I do rent scooters and they're great and cheap.  But I'm a rider, this is my passion, I want a motorcycle and I don't see a motorcycle as a luxury.  Which is perhaps my downfall.  Many things that are not luxuries in the USA - like regular motorcycles - are expensive luxuries in SEA.   you're arguing that no, you can't travel unless you're rich.   I'm arguing for a taste of realism.   Bums live on Manhattan for $0 and get around the USA for free.  Of course it can be done.  I'm pointing out that things do, in fact, cost money.  Just decent health insurance will cost you $1000/year, a bit cheaper if you're young and get the crappiest coverage.    I've heard the hype from people saying how cheap it is to travel.  And I went out there, only to realize that's not how I'm willing to live.  I don't want to fend off roaches and giant spiders in my guesthouse bathroom (which I've done), I don't want to sweat in a place with no A/c when the weather is 110 outside (which I've done).  I don't want to say ""no"" when I see amazing seafood dish that costs $12 because it blows my budget.  I don't want to sleep in a hostel with 5 other people in the room.  Am I talking luxury here, or basic quality of standard?    Yes, my post is written in the context of medium term travel.

Talk to someone there maybe about setting up transfers between a Thai bank (is there a trans fee, conversion fee, can you do it all online, ect.).   2) It sounds like you are an authorized user on your Mom's credit cards. I would:  a) See if any of those cards have foreign transaction fees. Hopefully there will be one or two that don't and you can use that in Thailand. Make sure to let them know you're going so they don't cancel the card thinking it's fraud.  b) Get your own credit card. Hopefully as an authorized user you've built up enough credit to apply for a card of your own. Look for a nice signup bonus and most importantly no foreign transaction fees.   3) Don't worry about taxes until you have to. Someone over in Thailand will have a better idea, and chances are there'll be other Canadians around and you can pool your knowledge. All else fails see a professional.   Other recommendations:   Invest. You're young and living in a cheap country. Sock away as much money as you can and put some of that money to work growing. I'm not overly familiar with Canadian investment firms so I can't recommend specifics, but the key is to make sure you're saving some.  Budget. Use Mint or Personal Capital, or if you have an iphone I'd say Trail Wallet. Set a goal for how much you want to spend and save per week or day, then track it."

I can go into more detail about investing and other things if you want, but to get there have to set up a stream for savings and start putting stuff in accounts first. It's worth it to put in some time learning it though. If you get some basics down it could make things easier in the future. More than anything though you want to end every month with a surplus.

If you are serious about being overseas for more than a full year, then you will likely want to make sure that you qualify as a non-resident.  Unlike other countries, Canada does not have set criteria to determine if someone is a resident or not. Instead CRA looks at how many  ties you have to Canada the list of things they look for is online somewhere. It includes things like owning property in Canada, having bank accounts, or a drivers licence. This is not to say that you cannot have any of these, just that having too many would be a problem. I keep my DL and one bank account and one credit card and I have had no problems. (Asking your bank will not help as they have no idea about these rules in my experience.)  There are some big issues though. Non-residents do not get health coverage. Do not ignore this as if you show up at a Thai hospital with your provincial card it wont help you. Entry level TESL jobs in Thailand may or may not have health coverage included, but you will need to sort this out. Thailand has great health care, but it is not free.  Also if you want to be a non-resident (not paying taxes) then you can't have it both ways. You won't qualify for many little things like GST rebate checks or reduced tuition if you take an online class.  Start out in TESL, but if you like it at all you should check out https://offsitegrad.tcnj.edu/ or similar programs to become a certified teacher  and look into international school work. (I did my masters in BKK through this program and I highly recommend it.) International schools offer far better packages than TESL and the benefits aren't even close."

Did you know that Seattle has Residential Parking Zone permits so you would need a permit to park in ""your own neighborhood"" if you lived in one of those zones?  Dallas had red light cameras that can't be appealed in court?  New York City has a lot of CCTV?

Almost all highways in Florida have tolls! The ones in the south are cashless, so you must have a registered SunPass RFID pass for your car.  Strip malls everywhere. Hicks, meth. So much meth in Florida. Your house was so cheap because it was the #2 state for foreclosures in 2008/2009. Crime rates through the roof. Not the kidnapping rate like Peru though, I suppose.  ""Stand your ground"" law, and police shootings are the norm.  Let's take Germany... The Autobahn. No tolls. No speed limit in places.  Free college.  Miniscule crime rate. Police force kept in check.  But yes, real estate costs a lot. Surprise! And gas is more expensive, but food is cheaper.

But to answer your concerns... Germany has cameras on traffic lights too, and no our cameras here are just to watch over traffic, they're only on busy intersections, and we are allowed to have dark tint so facial recognition wouldn't work. Heck my city tried to implement red light cameras to give out tickets, they got taken to court so much that they were removed last year.  Also, here we have no cameras on highways, I drove all over Germany and I do remember seeing cameras, specially those boxy ones in the median.   About the toll roads you are 110% wrong, I can travel over ALL of Florida without touching a single toll. There are toll highways in big busy cities, and non-toll highways. I do have a SunPass and it only ever gets used to pay for parking at the airports.   Hicks and meth? This is not Alabama. Just because you saw a story in the news about meth or bath salts in Florida doesn't mean it's everywhere.   No, crime rate is not through the roof, I can leave my $40k car outside unlocked with the keys inside and don't have to worry about it. Heck.. the back door lock to my house has never worked, and I don't really care for fixing it, that's how much crime there is here. I've worked for the same bank for 2 years and I've only heard of 2 people getting mugged because they were in a shady neighborhood.   I'm glad there is a stand your ground law. I'd much rather put a bunch of lead through someone that's threatening my life, than risk my own life.   I do like Germany, but I still think Florida is a much more convenient place to live.

It's very difficult, sometimes impossible, to get a work visa as an American. Obtaining a visa as a qualified professional really comes down to the demand for your skill, which is determined by Iceland Directorate of Immigration. I don't really think filmmaking or journalism is going to do it, but I am not certain. You would have to start networking and applying for jobs in Reykjavik to know how feasible this is.  Also, ""distant"" Icelandic heritage means nothing; outside of America, no one thinks anything about your ancestry. Most people will find you annoying for using phrases like ""I'm Icelandic"" or ""I'm a quarter Irish"". Please also note that Iceland is very secluded culturally; while most people are generally very friendly and happy to invite you out for a night at the club, the fact remains that you will always be kind of an outsider. I don't mean to discourage you, it's just a difficult culture. Winter isn't too bad as long as you're not really prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder; having only a close approximation of ""daylight"" around 11am-3pm is not so terrible but most people in Reykjavik stay indoors and do a lot of clubbing/gym/sauna."

These people are your related to your ancestors too since they (and some British) populated Iceland somewhere since the 800s!

First, you should check out this forum, it's full of people who of people who are going though or have gone through the PR process.  1) The way the application works is that you submit the sponsor and sponsored spouse's applications together and it's processed sequentially (sponsor first).   2) If you submit an Outland application (apply from outside Canada), you can still enter the country as a visitor or if you have a valid work permit. You can even submit an Outland application from within Canada (is what I've done). You have to remain in status (i.e. not overstay visa) or your application can be negatively affected.  3) 18 months is the current application processing time for a complete Outland application package, Americans typically have faster processing times (average is less than a year, I think).  4) You can't work without a work permit. If you are a recent college graduate, you can look in to the Students Working abroad Program. Or look for jobs that would qualify for a NAFTA work visa (that's a whole other topic). Or you could submit an Inland (apply within Canada) spousal sponsorship application for PR which has a processing time of 36 months but you can get a work permit after sponsor approval I believe.  To give a brief summary of what I did, I came up last year on a 1 year work open permit with SWAP, found a NAFTA eligible job and got a new, 3 year employer-specific work permit, and we recently just submitted our Outland application for PR.

Some visa classes flat out require you to return to your country for X years before even applying to immigrate to the USA. There are exceptions, such as getting married while in the USA. But when a student applies for a student visa, they are swearing that they don't intend to immigrate; it'd be silly to then allow them to stay because they changed their mind.

It's good that you've been reading migrant forums and finding the returner stories. One thing I recommend doing though is to look at the history of anyone being very negative about their experience, particularly if they're slating the country they migrated to.

All sorts of dealings with support, getting an internet, for example, is pain. Videotron requires me to give them my credit card data by phone, including CVC in order to process my payments? And then there are strange, restricting and stupid laws and regulations like 1 year lease period (at least in Quebec) and you have to wriggle around it when you want to rent a flat starting from odd month.

The other thing that bothered me was that Canada is so isolated in terms of relating to the world. In the news there is Canada, US and that's pretty much everything. Occasional news from Europe or other parts of the world only when random plane crashes down or somewhere there's born a calf with two heads. Well, it's not THAT bad, but still. Canadians do not have really any reason to discuss things other than those that happen in either Canada or US. It feels like a world unto itself.

There are workplace raids in the US that result in deportations.  The EU doesn't do mass raids (yet), so there are few routes to getting caught if you stay low.

You are right to be concerned about English, as almost all schools will (at least on paper) require English proficiency or else put you in intensive English courses that you will need to pay additional money for. As for work, you are allowed to work part-time on the campus, but not seek other work off campus (http://www.immihelp.com/visas/studentvisa/working-parttime.html), so I can tell you for sure it will not be possible to support yourself by working here while you study, and no benefits are given to help you find work after you finish, either. However, there is something much more important: an American education is crazily expensive. I was born here, and my expenses were high enough that I could have gone to school in Poland and used the remainder to buy a flat!

IWantOut,3bvze5,kraziazz,4,Thu Jul 2 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"The system you referred to as fast track immigration is brand new and is just political speak to replace the old system. Essentially under the new system you enter a pool and CIC will invite a number of people each year to apply if they meet certain requirements. It's not really fast tracked/express entry. It just helps them to look like they're eliminating backlogs. It's actually a really stupid system because you basically need an employer who is willing to wait years just to see if you'll even be able to apply.  The only other system currently available to you would be the NAFTA treaty visa where if you have certain professional qualifications for certain NAFTA treaty professions you can get approved for a work visa at the border for a job requiring those qualifications in Canada. Your husband would really need to go back to school for a Bachelor in Computer Systems Analysis and get a job in that field to take advantage of the system. Alternatively, you could get a a Bachelor in Physiotherapy and go the same route.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask. :)  P.S. Generally speaking all immigration systems work by giving you some sort of work status and/or permanent residence and after a number of years you may be able to apply for citizenship."

I will look into it.  How would I get a work status/permanent residence without citizenship?"
IWantOut,3bvze5,machinedog,2,Fri Jul 3 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"Essentially speaking if you have a qualification in physiotherapy and had a job offer you apply through the process laid out here: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-how.asp  Your spouse and children would receive dependent visas which do not allow them to work. Your spouse would have to try to obtain their own work visa while in Canada. He may be able to theoretically obtain an open work permit according to this FAQ page (Physiotherapy is an NOC Class A profession): http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=199&t=17  Work permits have to be renewed every couple of years. I am not certain how long they give, but my guess is they are valid for 2 years.  After 1 year of working in a professional capacity in Canada you can apply for Permanent Residence under the Canadian Experience Class program through the online ""Express Entry"" system. 8,000 applicants are accepted per year, so this may take some years to get in. Once approved, you (and your dependents) obtain permanent residence status.  After this, you must remain in Canada for 4 years before your family can apply for citizenship, but that is a relatively straightforward process that takes about a year between applying, scheduling the simple citizenship test, to scheduling the citizenship ceremony."

If you are American the latter works well, your default location remains USA, so calls to USA are free. I believe it works the same wherever your local country was, but I can't say for sure.

There are other apps as well that assign you a number and you use wifi/data to send actual txts. I personally use one called ""Heywire"".

I only did it because I knew it was just for the summer, but even then, it did not go over well. HOWEVER, I made it much better because, like you predicted, when you need to, you can.   I moved into a house that was farther from town than I could manage, not because I couldn't walk 2 miles there/back, but because it was difficult to carry anything (groceries, laundry, etc.) that distance. And then it would rain. And there were bugs and the house was dirty. It was just a really bad situation.   Though as I write this, I am sitting in my new room much closer to town with a very nice flatmate and a very clean house. It's fantastic; however, it took me a month to be able to get settled and happy.   So know that if you get there and the situation is bad, it doesn't mean that you have failed.

I would have an apartment lined up, and the addresses of two backups, In case you find out that it just won't work out where you had planned to live (the landlord pulls a bait and switch con or something). A roommate is always an option to keep costs down and to be sure that the roof isn't about to fall down on you, but then you have to be careful that you don't end up with someone crazy. Above everything else, budget for far more than you anticipate spending. You may get a job in the first place you walk into, or you might not be able to find one for a couple of months, and then if you're already getting short on cash and something godawful happens that you can't control (like some maniac driver comes speeding around a corner and runs you over while you're crossing the street or something) then having built a cushion into your budget can mean the difference between going and getting patched up without any trouble or having to decide between going to a doctor, eating, and making rent."

Sure, it's beautiful and the weather is mild for Canada, but cost of living is very high and wages are quite low. It's also very crowded, people are rude, drivers are awful, liquor laws are draconian, and nightlife is nonexistent. The job market is generally shitty as well."
IWantOut,3bt5ap,Livella,6,Wed Jul 1 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"I've picked it for a few reasons.  I get so depressed every winter, mostly from the amount of snow and cold.  I react so badly to the cold.  A lot of days in the winter I shiver so badly outside I get motion sickness and have thrown up before.  Its gotten so bad in recent winters to the point where I'm completely suicidal and can't even leave my house because it's so cold.  This past winter was a lot like that, and so I was told that I could use a change of scenery.  To me, being in the city in important.  I lived in Ottawa years ago, now I live in Toronto, both of which are massively cold.  Montreal is even colder, and very French.  Another thing I've been dreaming about a lot is living by the ocean, I think that this would beneficial to my mental health.  So that leaves Vancouver as a pretty good option.  My sister used to live there and loved it, my cousin lives there and loves it as well.  I've heard it's expensive, but it can't be anymore so than Ottawa or Toronto.  Most of the places I've looked at have actually been cheaper than places in these cities by $100-$200.  And as far as rudeness, I don't think there could be a ruder city than Toronto.    I understand the job market will be rough anywhere, it's just the current state of the world.  Whether I stay here or leave, my job opportunities are the same.  So I can have a shitty job in a climate I enjoy, or have a shitty job in a climate that makes my face literally bleed... I have a choice between going and stagnation, so I'll just go."

I didn't find people to be very friendly. I was studying and luckily my course was great. I was able to finish my degree in Belgium and Indonesia through Erasmus and a research stay so I was able to graduate without ever going back.

I used to live in the Czech Republic. I wanted to live in a country with better quality of life, simple as that. I don't actually dislike anything about the country per se; in my opinion it's behind economically (and in many ways socially) due to the years of communism, not through any fault of its own. All things considered I believe Czech Republic is one of the most progressed post-communist countries and that's awesome.    Where did you choose to move out to and why did you pick that place?    Norway. My SO at the time was Norwegian, my dream was actually to move to the UK.   What did you expect the country/city, that you picked, to be like? What did you like about it? (before moving there).    I honestly didn't have many expectations and I didn't know much about Norway besides what I heard/read and I knew that things would be very different from my point of view.   If you moved out: Was the new country what you expected it to be? What was it like in contrast with what you expected it to be?   I didn't have many expectations except that quality of life would be better and it is. So I guess yes. :)   What did you like/dislike about your new place?

The more I travel the more I realize how similar people are everywhere, that was honestly my biggest ""culture shock"".  That said, I still do like exploring new places and their little nuances, slang, local foods, languages etc. First I moved around to many different cities in my own country, then I felt like I needed to expand and spent time in europe and now I'm in south east Asia. For the most part I didn't choose where to go, I looked for opportunities and took them.   I feel like I could do this forever. I almost feel like I have to. Whenever I spend a very long time doing the same thing in the same place I feel like stuck in a mire. I get tired, I feel caught in a loop of routine and I feel like life has just become this tower of fake we build up to survive. Throwing yourself into work you hate as if you actually thought it was important, being nice to people you really don't like just because it makes your life a little simpler, etc. etc. I change up my life a lot with different jobs, different hobbies and moving to a different location is just one of the ways I like to change things up.

How to get documents: I'm not sure how Italy works for this, but for Luxembourg I simply contacted the national archives via email with the names and possible birth dates. They looked it up and mailed me the documents, but they have a highly centralized database and Italy may not.

Backstory: In the late 1800's to early 1900's there was a mass exodus of immigrants from Germany and Luxembourg to other countries and, from what I was told, Luxembourg lost nearly half of its population. The authorities at the time freaked out a little and thought that they were going to have a mass of people in their records that don't live in the country anymore. Essentially a paperwork nightmare so they just crossed everyone out and said they were no longer citizens of the country. The problem was they gave no notice to these people or a venue to challenge this decision. Since the ensuing generations could have kept the citizenship intact if the authorities wouldn't have done this, they passed a law in 2008 that said if you can prove your relative was citizen, you can recover the citizen that was stripped of them. This law temporary and is set to expire on December 31 2018.   Let me know if you're interested and I'll write up a big post about the process and people to contact.

Know that even if you don't make any money in the United States that you are liable for taxation by the US government. File your US Taxes every year. There are treaties in place to make sure you are only taxed by one country. (Your first 100k income each year outside the US is not taxed by the US. Canada has extra treaties in place so that you are only taxed the higher amount, generally this means you are taxed in Canada and not the US because of the higher tax rates.)   There are also treaties in place to protect pension plans and retirement savings accounts in each country (Roth IRA and RRSPs for US and Canada respectively). However, Tax Free Savings Accounts in Canada are NOT covered by these treaties yet and they are considered to be a Foreign Trust by the IRS. This places a large complex burden each year in taxes and is generally considered not worth it if you are an American citizen. Also, each year that you have over $10,000 In assets in Canadian Bank accounts/land etc. you must file a FBAR. PENALTIES FOR NOT FILING AN FBAR ARE SEVERE. Up to 50% of undocumented assets. They don't care if you just didn't know. This is important. FBARs must be received by the IRS by the certain end date not just sent by date. File early.

IWantOut,3bt82d,PinguRambo,3,Thu Jul 2 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"You can go to NZ on a working holiday visa after you graduate, which has cooler weather than Aus (especially South Island).  Ireland is another option - this one you can only do right after graduating.  Also consider that Tasmania does not have particularly warm weather.  You can't expect to find work in your desired field when you go because it's only a 1 year visa.  Most people end up doing stuff like restaurant/retail work and seasonal agricultural work.  It's possible to get something better than this, but just unlikely because employers would typically want someone with work authorization for longer than 1 year and would have to sponsor you on another work visa to keep you longer.

IWantOut,3bsrjw,AlvarexM,3,Wed Jul 1 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"Technically, all US military contracts are 8 years-- N years of active/reserve/guard duty and (8 - N) years in the Individual Ready Reserve. It is exceedingly rare for people in IRR status to be called up. I can't speak to the other branches, but I understand that the Army does not pursue people in IRR status who fail to report. At the time I was in, the word on the street was that the best route to avoid IRR reactivation was to piss hot upon reporting.  So, technically the contract is 8 years, but the time you spend in active/reserve/guard status will be shorter than that. You can effectively only look at the active/reserve/guard time and ignore the IRR time.  I was like you once-- with a nagging desire to be a soldier. It's not like you imagine. It's far more boring and stupid. Imagine standing in the queue at the supermarket for four years before you can check out. You can probably think of a lot of things you would rather do than wait in a queue for four years. Now imagine the queue is 40% jocks and 40% losers from your high school. Now imagine the jocks are in charge and can order you to do whatever. They won't intentionally order you to do anything seriously immoral or illegal, but they'll think of plenty of things that are personally convenient for them, and things to keep you busy so that you don't bother them or get into trouble, and the occasional thing that they think is useful-- too bad they're not the brightest bulbs in the marquee and the work, whether it's meant to serve a purpose or not, is a waste of effort 99% of the time, and it rarely matters if it actually gets done or not.   Pardon me for being blunt, but that's the reality of the military. You go in wanting to do cool military shit, and find yourself spending all of your time polishing the fixtures in the bathroom for four hours, painting rocks, moving sandbags from smokers' pit to the other, raking lines in sand, cutting grass with scissors, and waxing the floor for the fourth time today. You think ""I'm okay with following orders"" until you realize how asinine the orders are and how stupid and vain the people issuing them are.  I don't expect to dissuade you from joining the military. My father and my friends who had been in the military tried to stop me from joining. If they had described it as I did above, maybe I would have stopped, but it's really something that needs to be experienced to be understood. And, I understand that when you have that bee up your bonnet, you really want to see it. Good luck.  So, if you really want to join the military don't let the ""8 year contract"" with the US military dissuade you. Excepting something truly fucked up happening, you're only going to be practically obligated to the military during the active/reserve/guard component of the contract. Just know ahead of time that it's a stupid institution, and I recommend to have the phone number of these guys written somewhere you can access it. They'll give you advice on your rights, and help you get out early if you want to.  By the way, the Air Force still has bases in England, if I recall correctly. From what I've heard, they also have the least douchey culture. Before military service, I would very much recommend reading the books ""The Good Soldier Svejk"" and ""Catch 22."" You'll appreciate them later."

Commonwealth citizens must be living in the UK for five years anyway to join the regular military and citizens are able to join.  To join the reserves, one must be a citizen or a commonwealth with indefinite leave to remain (a permanent residency permit).

You should also be able to keep some sort of US bank account assuming you can provide a US mailing address.  I don't know what the tax situation would be with that, since interest income will be reported to the IRS.  I suppose it would require filing the non-resident tax form each year, but after the standard deduction you would probably have no taxable income in the US anyway, regardless of other tax treaties.  For the CD, you would only have any US income once the CD expires.    With cash, you would usually just arrange to do a wire transfer into your new account.  It's often worth waiting until something favorable happens with the exchange rate, if it's historically bad right now.

If you mean an apartment, then the majority of Europeans own their own apartment (which is part of what makes the rental market difficult in most cities).  In many countries you'll need some kind of special permission to purchase as a non-citizen.  Anyway sounds like TEFL would be the main way over for you, which will largely limit you to eastern and southern Europe.  In general the further east you go in Europe, the hotter it can get in summer because the climate gets more continental the further you go toward the giant Eurasian landmass.  And I guess it goes without saying that southern Europe can be pretty hot.  CZ and Baltic countries are probably the coolest places you could go for it.    I'd still recommend considering downtown Seattle and Portland.  You can probably make just as decent a living over there as you could on TEFL wages in CZ for instance.

I think you'd need to go to a very third world country to even remotely consider retiring on the money you have now, and it would have to be coupled with some kind of amazing investment strategy for what you do have.  Also consider do you ever want to visit family or friends again in the US?  It can easily cost over $1000 for an air ticket back, so that needs to be figured into costs.

The towns here are indeed nice and walk-able. The summer can get pretty hot and the winter can get pretty cold but nothing unbearable.    The language is very hard, harder than Czech in my opinion (And I was born in Czech Republic). My English teacher who has been living here for 15 years still doesn't speak Slovak quite right. My mother who is a Czech, still speaks Czech even after living here for 20 years.   It is very possible to live here without a car, many do,  but if you decide to own a car remember that the price of gasoline is significantly higher than in the states. And even though the Cost of Living is very low, so will your income be. The average is about 600 Euro, the Minimum is 380 Euro. You won't be able to live of off the 380 Euro, yet some employers won't even give you that. The unemployment rate is quite high at 12% and poverty is common.   I am not sure why anybody would want to live here... especially anyone from the US. Czech Republic might be a  bit better choice for you but still.. Why would you leave the US to go to live to central europe?  Even though the cost of living is higher in the US... the buying power is much much higher as well.

Comparing countries like Ireland, Finland and Japan to Slovakia is just unheard of, it's a nice country here, with a decent nature, nothing unusual or very unique just the average. People are not very nice here either on the contrary, I've heard few tourists complain about that.   In my eyes this country tries to be like the western countries, but just fails at it hard. Urbanization is happening here, but of-course there is a countryside where you could have a farm etc. but... no-one knows a single word in English in the countryside, so that would be hard for you.   But hey take this with a grain of salt because I am just someone who also plans on leaving this country to live somewhere better. So maybe I just look at it too critically.  Yeah south-east asia would qualify, except the heat is really unbearable there. What about cold? Can you take cold?   Because than you could try Iceland, which is really a big country with a very small population. Not sure about COL, but I think that could work for you.  Or maybe New Zealand? The weather there is perfect,  12.5°C in winter  and 20°C in summer, arguably even better than in Ireland. Not many people live there neither, the scenery is very nice, people talk English, are very laid-back. Healthcare I think should be good there, internet sucks there but you said you don't care about that it just needs to work.   If you really want to try it here, I would recommend going to Czech Republic first, checking that out, maybe try the smaller towns like  Cesky Krumlov and because the borders are open you can direcly travel to Slovakia and check that out too!  Lastly, I think it would be pretty damn easy for you to find a job here as an English teacher, since there is not much of those here.

Plenty of locals with the language skills will be hogging up those, and the pay will be ridiculously low (even compared to the local cost of living). Maybe you could tend bars in Prague for a while, or work in the tourism sector in the summer, but don't expect the employer to do it on the books.

These will universally require a job offer first with an employer as your sponsor.  If it's through TEFL, then an agency will be your sponsor.  If you just head over there, you'll only be on tourist visa waiver and you're not allowed to work there much less reside there with that.  I say in my other post that I think your main option is TEFL because a BS in accounting with zero accounting experience is not going to get you sponsored for an accounting job abroad.  As for language, in some fields of work, you'll find companies that commonly maintain an English-speaking workplace, but I imagine this is not the case for 99.9% of employment in accounting.  Also counter to previous comment, Hungary, Poland, CZ etc definitely have nowhere near the same climate as Ireland, they're much more continental.

I'm teaching English in Korea right now in fact and have saved up a ton of money here, but if I went to go teach in Europe my savings would be erased quickly and I'd be defaulting on my loans.  With a slightly higher pay in a business/marketing office type job (I know EU salaries are lower anyway) I could make it work.

I'm 23 now and having EU citizenship would make things so much easier. Last time I checked with the IND - this was in 2013 or so - I was told I can't reapply for citizenship from abroad. But apparently, if I establish legitimate residency in the Netherlands for 1 year, I can apply for and take the citizenship test. Since you normally need 5 years of residency to apply, this is sort of an expedited reapplication.  Does anyone know if this still holds true? Dutch immigration laws are changing so often, I just can't keep up.  More dumb questions: is there an easier way? What counts as residency?

If you successfully complete a civic integration course (at A2-level) or attain another diploma you will be eligible for an exemption.

Workers in the Third World produce the vast majority of profitable labor power in the world today, undercompensated enough to fund not just the profits of Western capitalists but also the inflated wages and living standards of the Western labor aristocracy. The day the West can stop flaying itself for the sins of its ancestors toward the Third World is the day it abolishes the Third-World debts and properties it inherited from those ancestors as a direct consequence of those sins, off of which it continues to gorge.  Of course, doing this would upend the capitalist world system, to which the notion of outright abolishing a debt or property relation is an existential affront, but until this is done imperialism can't be said to have meaningfully ended."

They are paid enough in their respective societies to achieve a decent lifestyle and raise a family, which is what every laborer should be paid in their respective society, unless you think we should all be living under feudalism. The fact that third world people could and would do it cheaper doesn't mean Western wages are ""inflated."" It means rich capitalists are moving capital around to take advantage of cheaper labor to avoid paying their own people a living wage so they can pad their own pockets. You think Westerners wanted all those jobs exported? No, we wanted to keep them, and we wanted the wage for them to continue to be enough to live a decent life. But thanks to the massive wealth (and thus, power and influence) of greedy capitalists, many of those jobs went bye-bye. Yes we'd have to pay more money for food and gadgets and such, but that wouldn't be so bad--we'd have more jobs, more stability, higher populations, more homogenous populations, and fewer individuals with massive amounts of power to the point where they could basically control the world.     My point is, the third world taking their sorrows out on ""the West"" is completely and utterly unjustified. Your average Westerner is also a mere pawn in this capitalist globalist system, even if our standards of living might be higher. The villains here aren't ""Westerners,"" it's a few thousand people with a ridiculous amount of wealth and power. Flooding the entire west with immigrants as ""punishment"" or comeuppance makes no sense, as the average Westerner didn't do anything wrong.

IWantOut,3bn5us,wantouttobg,11,Tue Jun 30 15:48:11 2015 UTC,Bullshit. Over a billion people from India and China would immigrate to the US if they had the resources/opportunities. Same could be said about many other third world/developing countries.
IWantOut,3bn5us,yakandyeti,3,Tue Jun 30 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but would the US be their first choice?  Or if they had the opportunities and resources would that mean the quality of life would be decent enough for them to not want to emigrate?  Many people would migrate if meant a better life, but many don't for a variety of reasons.  How many Americans do you think would migrate to Europe if they had the resources and opportunities, or vice versa?  There's no clear answer to any of those questions."
IWantOut,3bn5us,PortlandoCalrissian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:21:26 2015 UTC,"Billion seems a a little high considering India and China have 2 billion each. I doubt half a country would seriously move to the US, unless there was serious economic or political instability in those places. Moving is hard, you don't necessarily know the language, your friends and family are mostly likely where you are already living(although if the US had a totally open border more people might move in groups and you'd see waves of immigration), and lastly most people have at least some attachment to their homes."

I mean, one of my best friends graduated from a top tier University and was making 350 bucks/month as telecom engineer. How ridiculous is that? And he's been working there for nearly 4 years now!   People living in the Western World simply don't get it. There's a reason why America's called the land of opportunities.   Work hard/study hard. You'll see good results.

In fact if I were to hire someone I'd strongly value critical thinking over a graduate with a technical degree but is socially awkward, and can't think for them self, but the reality is companies rarely hire with that mentality anymore.   Try to see the hiring curve ahead, because one never knows how it may change, but here in the US companies don't want to spend the money to train anyone anymore. You need to come out of college an expert in your niche, and hit the floor running. I have a communication degree as well, and it's been useless. To me communication theory is something that makes for a few nice extra class incorporated in a Business degree... but how the hell communication became it's own field of major I do not know.   I picked it because I thought it would make me money, but half way through my senior year I was like, ""shit this is useless."" I think media studies might be better, but I was in PR, and that's been my experience. Unless you know someone to give you a foot in the door I imagine it'll be pretty hard in another country where you'll know so few people. Plus it's easier to immigrate to the US if you can fill a hole in the employment that the local population isn't filling.  I'd minor in Philosophy, and go for something more technical in hindsight unless you plan on becoming a lifetime philosopher or something."

IWantOut,3bnsmb,combathorse,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Travelers are most likely to get jobs in the tourist industry so that would be the best place to start. I think the best option is look for the typical tourist sites for activities, like the Sydney Harbour Climb and email them directly, sell yourself and your skills, plan ahead, schedule your travel for the beginning of peak tourist times. You will also be expected to have decent knowledge and applicable skills so mention eg the fact your family water ski's every summer so are experience in the operation of small boats blah blah. They probably won't offer you a job without seeing you first but they could provide some useful feedback. But warning, jobs are hard to get so be willing to be flexible and contrary to popular belief, we are super hardworking people and are the world leader in unpaid overtime.

You just can't run a business in that kind of environment if you're permanently stuck with anyone you hire.  Businesses are unwilling to to open branches there or to hire more workers, and the workers who do have jobs have no incentive to do more than just enough to avoid getting fired, and so they end up with high unemployment, a lack of startup companies, and low productivity.

I miss my friends, my old career there, and sooo many more things that are just so different here.  I'm in south america now and leave in 1 month for Europe. Even though it's tempting to go back to what is normal and familiar to me, I don't want to go back yet. You know why? Living abroad is so damn interesting. It's not all roses. There are MANY difficult things about it.    I'm envious of the European system of paid days off, health care, less insane jingoism, etc.   Every place has its ups and downs. Try not to romanticize a place too much. Don't go in with many expectations, just know there will be ups and downs. The highs are very high but the lows can be quite low. You're in a place where things are different, sometimes language barrier, don't have your high school bff or your (Insert usual go-to person here) to lean on, except for maybe skype.   But damn..it's an experience unlike any other. If you are leaning toward a yes, then I say just go for it BUT understand that it's ok if you don't like it and want to go back home sooner than expected.It's not for everyone. If things don't work out, then, well you go back home. But if you never even try you might regret it forever.  P.S. As far as skills go, look into TEFL seeing as how you are a native English speaker. I think teaching is hard and I'm not a huge fan, so I'm getting out of teaching for now. But many people like it, maybe you will too. Look into /r/TEFL for info about getting qualified."

IWantOut,3biiri,pyridine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for it since it is a good point in your life (although see suggestions below).  As you've discovered though, it is damn difficult to get a job abroad.  About 1000X more difficult than getting a job on the opposite side of the US.  How much experience do you have and in what field, exactly?  Is your experience in something that's globally in demand?  If your career is something you can leave behind, then TEFL is one of the only easy ways out while also having paid work, if you aren't in the sort of work that employers hire for from abroad.  Masters degrees are also a viable option if you can afford it (even with free tuition, you still need money in the bank to prove you can cover living expenses to get a student visa), and most programs in the EU are not terrible competitive compared to US counterparts,  and a masters is almost automatic admission if you meet the requirements.  However there is usually some minimum grade cutoff according to whatever their conversion is, beyond which you basically can't pursue graduate education in Europe (they won't care as much about hardship stories or whatnot, a disadvantage about the European higher educational structure is that it's much less fluid than in the US, you can't really change fields, etc...consider this a consequence of socialism).  But to be honest, I think you'll most likely get out and then will want to return to the US in a couple years, since it doesn't sound like you have a particularly bad life there.  But you need to experience that for yourself to ever quench your desire.  I'd say that just taking time off and traveling would be the best option, and traveling is a hell of a lot more fun than dealing with the daily grind of working and living in a foreign country anyway.  And if you have enough money to go to grad school, you should have enough money to take at least 6 months off and travel, which is the sweet spot with maximum time to stay abroad anyway.    I've been in Denmark for 3 years and still mourn every day for what I've left behind in the US.  Yes, there are some real advantages to living here, and you are already well aware of what those are.  But what you're not seeing are all the hundreds of disadvantages that are only apparent once you're actually plunked down somewhere.

It would be much more feasible for you to sponsor him on a fiance or spouse visa in the US, as you are employed and the financial requirements are much lower in the US. Either way, you will probably need to marry if you want to move to be with one another. Salaries are generally higher in the US than the UK so this may be a better move for your careers, as well.  Edit: Sorry, I didn't actually answer your question. The answer is no; debt is not directly considered for the financial requirement to sponsor a spouse or prospective spouse.

Otherwise things might not pan out and you'll be downtrodden for damn near life.  The music and writing are things you can always do in your spare time and keep trying to get momentum in, especially in a new location, which will take time. That seems to me to be the best of both situations while the music can keep you sane throughout the regular boring education of whatever you choose, which does not have to be law school, but  something that is worth your time to study, that you at least remotely can enjoy as a career, and will be a good thing to fall back on if you need, that can provide well for you throughout life. the great thing about you having all this musicianship already, is that you can practically never lose it and it can treat you well in clubs and whatever you manage to break into for the rest of your life.

If you want to train in something else that's higher paying, and then live in London on a professional job, still trying to make it as a songwriter ... well, you'll still be broke, but less so.

I would imagine you could send songs you've written out to record companies and talent spotters from anywhere, really. Maybe I'm missing something.

They will need to have an Employer Sponsorship License. I would start looking up companies that have the ability to sponsor you and make contact with them about the possibility of gaining employment with them. If a company doesn't have the ability to sponsor you then I wouldn't waste my time with them.   Your fluency in Russian could be a huge feather in your cap. Unusual for a westerner to be fluent in the language. I'd search out what opportunities that could bring.    but this article was published prior to Conservatives winning majority, and if this policy does go through-I really highly doubt it would happen in the next five years because of the amount of backlash it would get.    The Tories have pegged themselves into a corner with immigration. Their whole spiel is about getting the numbers down. They have promised to get the net migration numbers down to 'the tens of thousands' when it's currently at 318k. Last term they introduced stringent financial criteria for non EU spouses of British citizens and clamped down hard on English language schools(this was just imho). They can't touch EU migration, legitimate asylum seekers, genuine students coming to study etc so they have only two real targets left - non EU students trying to stay upon completion of their studies and family reunification visas.

IWantOut,3bdblx,wantouttobg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"I know agog the whole employment list, I've had a look at it since day one. I attained a summer internship in London this summer at the top distributor of news in the UK/worldwide (you probably know which one I'm talking about). The application alone took four months, three rounds of interviews and 300 people which they narrowed down to me. I'm still in disbelief I got it, but I think it's because of my anxiety about not being able to stay in the UK afterwards which is what motivated me to really push to get it.  Do you think I should try learning another language alongside my studies? Or maybe learning how to code? I just want to be as diverse as possible when it comes to a graduate, and I know that once I leave university employers are going to have hundreds of thousands talented English Lit graduates streaming into high level jobs, so the more that can set me apart the better. That means that alongside my studies I am (already) the Public Relations Organizer for my university charity fashion show, writing the advertisements for a start-up company, writing for three different online publications which are well known nationally, and working at a student run start up at my university. Yes, all of this might sound impressive, but I need more. I am literally happy to cram all my time into these faucets in the instance that I get a guaranteed job upon completion. This three month paid internship with the company that I'd dream to work for upon leaving university isn't a guarantee I'll be working there once I do leave. I will need to work even harder to ensure that I am memorable/make an impact.   Thing is, I actually voted Tory in this election (part of a Commonwealth, so I can) because I believe they can make the UK better economically-please don't judge. No party, apart from Lib Dem or maybe Green lol, had a good stance towards migration. UKIP would have had me waving goodbye at the border as well. It's just such a shame because I've truly grown up in this country and I really think I have so much to offer, but unless I am literally top 10 in my course I have very to little chance of staying. Which is why I'm considering doing a master's at LCE or UCL or something (so I can find graduate employment in my beloved London after).  I don't get why she sees students as a threat. Ok, my degree might be a joke, but I consider myself an excellent qualified candidate for someone who should be allowed to stay. I also have a dual nationality with Israel, do you think that this would be an issue or help my case? I don't necessarily want a UK passport (and it'll be hard for me to get one anyway) but I would love to have the indefinite leave status. What do you think?  EDIT: Also, in the instance that they do enforce a new rule to kick out students upon graduation, I PRAY TO GOD that May and her cronies would probably let my year and the year prior do the 4 month thing, simply because they didn't come into a majority until I was halfway done my degree. I could argue that had I known the Tories would be in majority two years prior, I would not have pursued education in the UK. My parents pay an extortionate fee for me to study there, so I don't see how they wouldn't consider that."

You could argue that they should but unless you get married or find sponsorship your chances of gaining residency are zilch.

Technically, you're not supposed to look for work on those visas, but if you happen to meet people and they happen to offer you a job later, you've just had good luck.  You could get a J1 as a trainee somewhere and stay in the US for up to 18 months, if I recall correctly. You work and collect a salary on J1. After the J1 expires, you need to leave the US and stay out for 2 years before applying for an H1B unless you fit certain criteria.  You could come as a student on an F1 visa. School fees will likely be much higher than in Denmark, but there's a good chance your studies will transfer and your university will grant you credit for your studies in Denmark, so you don't need to start a new degree program from the beginning. You'll need to show that you have sufficient money to support yourself while you study in order to get the visa. According to the wikipedia article I just checked, there are a lot of restrictions on employment for F1 visa holders, but I know several people who got jobs while in the US on an F1.  Depending on how badly you want to live in the US and what you're willing to give up, you should be aware that once you're inside the US, in most places it's very rare that your immigration status is ever verified in most places. I have a friend who came over on an F1 over fifteen years ago and hasn't left since then. He's doing well, and is the CEO of a small business, but if he leaves the US, he's not getting back in."

If so, in Australia you can get a teaching degree by just doing one extra year, basically turning your existing degree into a teaching one.

It is big business for Australian universities to fleece foreign students but if you have the money it's worth it.  It is also important what kind of teaching you'll be doing, eg it's far easier to get a job as a math/science high school teacher or a male primary school teacher. Everything else is super competitive but your Honours degree should give you an edge. One major factor when becoming a teacher is if you don't get a job in a private school, you will likely have to do your time in a rural area to work for state government (the largest provider of education in Aus) so you may have to do 1 or 2 years in the bush."

A 2 year diploma is about £15000, a full uni course depends on the course itself, for example a bachelor degree in engineering is about £85000, but a bachelor of teaching looks about £30000+ depending on a variety of factors.

IWantOut,3b9xaj,Alamagoozlum,4,Sat Jun 27 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"Even with citizenship in an EU member state job opportunities for anthropology and archaeology are incredibly limited and therefore highly competitive as a result. Almost all of the people I know in these fields have had to leave the UK and gain experience working in South America, the Middle East or Asia, often for very little pay, before building up the networks and contacts to find a paying job in Europe.  Further to this, two of the top universities in the world - Oxbridge - churn out classics and archaeology students and, unfortunately, in the UK this education carries enough clout to be ""first choice"" for many institutions - not least of all because many places (such as the British Museum) have programmes affiliated with specific colleges through former graduates. Make sense? I'm just trying to caution you that it won't be particularly easier to make it work here and in this industry, I would highly suggest you look at going to school in the country you wish to work in because your network and connections will play a major part in finding a position.  It's great to have a back-up plan, but I wouldn't bank on it either.  It's my understanding to serve in EUCOM you'd be transferred within the US military internally. The positions they hire for in Europe are for non-military posts, but I could be wrong as I am not a military-affiliated person in the slightest.

German universities are free/very cheap, and some teach in English. A list of others is here http://www.studyineurope.eu/tuition-fees. England is getting almost as expensive as the U.S.  Also factor in cost of living, it may be cheaper to pay tuition fees and live in a much cheaper country than get free tuition in Scandinavia.   If you don't have a European passport it's generally more expensive.   Generally in Europe it's easier to live on a very low buffet than in the USA, especially if you have citizenship.

In addition to U.S. states, this includes the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.    Citizenship, however, was not specified in the original Constitution.

What do benefit claimants do when they are presented with a basic income?  Are they more or less likely to study, get a job, set up a business, contribute to the community?

Oh, and that increase in taxes would also increase the production cost of everything in said country, which would drive the exports to the ground because other countries without UBI do it cheaper.

Land is a completely separate factor of production from labor and capital. It is well established by the field of economics as being a different beast, with different rules. Land is the primary form of wealth, historically speaking, as it can generate passive income, and it continues to be heavily concentrated in the hands of the wealthy.  Shifting to Land Value Taxation means those same taxes you pointed out the problems of, those on labor (wages, individual income tax), capital (corporate income tax, capital gains), and buildings (property taxes), can be reduced or eliminated."

Visa and status are two different things. Your friend has up until 60 days past the program end date on her Form I-20 to apply for OPT.   The visa is what allowed your friend to enter the U.S. What she has been doing since e.g. going to class, essentially doing what she has to do to maintain F-1 status, she can remain in the U.S. as F-1's barring specific circumstances, are admitted for Duration of Status (F-1 D/S). If her visa expires while she is in the U.S. but she has been doing everything she is supposed to maintain her F-1 status, she's fine.   The next time she leaves the U.S. to travel to her home country or outside the areas listed in the visa revalidation rule, she will need to set aside time to obtain a visa renewal.  OPT is a derivative benefit of folks in valid F-1 status. Since she has a pending OPT application, her F-1 status is extended beyond the 60 day grace period assuming it was timely filed and is still pending adjudication. It is unclear by your post if you mean her school advisor recommended her for OPT or that USCIS came back with an approval (I-797A Notice of Action). If the OPT application is still pending and it has been more than 75 days since USCIS received her application, then she should call the customer service number located on the OPT Receipt Notice.  Important question: If she was recommended for OPT but did not mail it to USCIS OR it was received by USCIS more than 30 days after the OPT recommendation was made, then your friend will need to have her advisor cancel the existing OPT recommendation and resubmit. She will also need to pay the filing fee again. USCIS is very good about cashing the check and saying, ""No.""  While on OPT, the individual is still in F-1 status. They may travel to Mexico, Canada, and Caribbean using an expired F-1 visa due to automatic visa revalidation. If she travels outside those areas, she will need to apply for a visa renewal.   tl;dr: No, she does nothing if she has approved OPT and received EAD. (Does her school have a copy of her EAD? If not, she should submit a copy to them). HOWEVER, she does need to update her school with her employer information and/or residential address within 10 days of the change. Also, obtain a travel signature every 6 months. While on OPT, the travel signature is only valid for 6 months despite the 12 months printed on the Form I-20."

If you're in a tourist area the likelihood of Spanish police asking you for id and questioning you is very low. If you stick out and are in a non tourist area then the likelihood rises.   I think it's an unnecessary risk but if you're going to do it don't go out drinking or do anything that will bring attention to yourself. Also, get the passport and other documents fedexed over and back. Pay that little extra to ensure they get over and back safely.  Have you spoken to the Spanish consulate about this? Explain the situation to them. You're going there to work and study through the correct channels so perhaps they can accomodate you."

That's just the way things are and the consulate knows that. Most schools can do a ""reserva de plaza"" for you that will do the trick.   The problem with your other plan of doing things remotely and sending your passport is that  they will be able to see that your entry stamp is before the visa was issued. That's a big red flag if you plan on staying long enough to get a residency card. Spain is very strict about not allowing you to enter on a tourist visa and convert it to any sort of residency. The police check that sort of thing when you apply for your TIE. I also think the consulate will notice that you have that entry stamp and no exit stamp. I wouldn't chance it."

However, unless you have extremely marketable skills, you are going to have a very rough time coming here.   Most low skilled occupations have no track to permanent residency, and there is a shortage of skilled worker visas which will make getting here quite difficult as they only accept a certain amount of people per job class each year. You can research ""Skilled Worker NOC (national occupation classification)"" to get an idea of what they are accepting.   If you aren't American, you may qualify for a working holiday visa, but that also doesn't offer a track to permanent residency.   I'm sorry to not have better news for you. Unfortunately, getting into Canada is much like trying to get into any other highly developed nation - difficult.   I'm an American in Canada right now, but my fiancé is Canadian - so my path wouldn't be any help for you!  Quick edit:  Taking a test is for citizenship. And there is a certain amount of time that you must be in Canada to gain citizenship, not residency. Unfortunately even if you're in Canada for ten years on a permit that doesn't have a path to permanent residency, you'll still have to go back home.

I'm working on a spousal application for permanent residence so my experience might be a little different.   We chose to go with an immigration lawyer, which wasn't as expensive as we thought it would be but between the medical exams, background checks, application fees, etc... it adds up quick.   Before I got married, I tried to see about coming in as a skilled worker, since I have a degree in a high-demand field in Canada. If you haven't, check the CIC's website to see if you qualify as a skilled worker. From what I experienced and what I have gathered from others, without being a skilled worker, it's next to impossible to 1) find an employer willing to put a lot of time and money into you for months before you're actually able to work, and 2) to convince the government to even let you in to do the job.  Basically, the potential employer has to fill out a whole big application packet, pay hundreds of dollars in application fees, and submit an affidavit stating how long they've had the position open and why a Canadian citizen cannot be hired to do the job. Obviously, that's highly subjective and that makes it incredibly difficult to obtain a work permit without gaining express entry as a skilled worker.   We ended up deciding to get married so I never had to actually complete that particular application process. However from my experience, one of the most important things is that you have to have at least one year paid work experience. Relatively fresh out of school, I had a whole lot of volunteer experience and 3 years worth of an unpaid internship but none of that would count. You also have to take a language test, regardless if English is your native language or not and it costs quite a bit more than you would think.   However, if you really want to come to Canada, don't let any of that deter you. Just be aware what you're getting into. Immigration's job is to keep people out and most of the application process really reflects that.   Good luck!"

When you enter a specific EU country, your work permit and residence permit is directly tied to your employer. If you are a non-EU citizen living/working in the EU, you will only have the right to live and work in that specific EU country.  At some point (length of time varies per EU country), your EU residency switches over from being tied to a specific employer and becomes a general residency in that specific country.   You have the right to travel to and from all EU/Schengen countries (non-Schengen usually have some sort of agreement that they recognize your EU residency... except the UK, they refuse to recognize EU residence permits for cross border travelling).  Either side of the EU residency status (while tied to a specific employer and after) you do not have the right to relocate to another EU country and simply take up work. You can only reside and work in that one country.  You can move to a new country of course, but you have to take up the immigration process from scratch.  The time to be released from being tied to a specific employer varies... what I've seen is 2 to 5 years.  Austria is 2 years... Germany is 2 years... Spain is I think.. 5.. and so on.  If you loose your job while still tied to a specific employer, then you are not going to have a good time if you want to remain in the EU... you need to find a new job FAST and associated sponsorship.  If you loose your job AFTER you are no longer tied to your employer (eg after 2 years in Austria), you have full access to the social support system, and assistance with re-employment etc.  Basically, you're not out the door, and have rights as a long term resident."

For 15 years, you knew that if you lost your job and couldn't find another quickly, you would have to leave. You knew that if you got married, you could stay.

He mentions nothing about talking to immigration lawyers and what sort of strategy they recommended or anything along these lines.  At least in DC, there's plenty of educated foreigners moving here, including my former roommate who came from Italy.  I think he came on work visa and eventually got permanent resident status... Not sure.  But there's definitely plenty of very well educated people coming.  That said, if we look deeper into the statistics, it's embarrassing to see who comes to the USA.  It's not even people from developing countries, but rather, very poor people with no skills from developing countries.    But maybe that has been the intention the whole time.

The sad part is those payments go on for 30 damn years! Luckily I was able to work my way through undergrad, so I graduated without any debt from there.

I'm not trying to downplay the restrictions in place (they are indeed a huge barrier for non-EU citizens), but I feel like the statement you're making (regarding the ""community preference"" for EU citizens on the labor market) gets thrown around a lot in a way that implies a certain hopelessness of finding jobs in the EU. I am in no way an expert on EU labor policy, but from my understanding, the way this ""community preference"" rule is used in practice does not present a scenario quite as gloomy as you suggest:   ""For vacancies advertised through the EURES system and the public employment services of the Member States, it is a straightforward matter to ensure that EU labour is preferred over non-EU labour. However, not all job vacancies come to the attention of EURES and it may in some cases be difficult to ensure that EU nationals systematically receive preference. Jobs advertised through private recruitment firms represent the bulk of jobs advertised and at the higher end of the market, many people are recruited through headhunting firms. There can be many reasons why a firm needs to recruit non-EU nationals and in a global economy, this is acceptable practice. However, where there is no particular reason to hire a non-EU national, the rule of Community preference must be applied and this should apply at all stages, from selection up.""   http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/pdf/press_corner/publications/55260_practica_guide_including_comments_en.pdf  I also have direct experience in this situation. As a U.S. citizen, I have interviewed for entry-jobs (albeit requiring a master's degree), directly competing with EU citizens, and the company still willing and able to hire me over them, despite them being just as ""suitable"" for the position.

I can't say those countries would be dirt cheap. I believe learning Spanish in Bolivia is probably the cheapest. Being that you live in Asia, I think getting a Thai extension on your visa is cheap but I have no information as to language schools. SA would mean that if you aren't able to get a visa extension you could just cross a border and use the same language.   The world is your oyster but your question is pretty vague and open ended.   Depending on your age and experience, you could get a scholarship to study for free. I've heard of scholarships for 6 months to 2 years in various countries including China, France, Germany.

My wife is a primary school teacher in Italy.  Right now she teaches English (as a non-native speaker), but in Italy they speak it much worse than you Swedes do, so I don't know that there would be as much demand.  (But with the Renzi reform, which passed just yesterday, they're actually planning on getting rid of English teachers and forcing regular non-specialist teachers to teach it even though most of them can't string four words together!  People who went to university to be english teachers, like my wife did, will be forced into being regular non-specialist primary school teachers.)  She can also teach Italian at any level, but we don't know if there's any demand for that.  That's what she has to offer.  She is very good with languages.  She has two native languages, speaks English as well as any Swede does, and speaks a few others.  She just started doing a little online thing on Swedish, and if it turns out there is any possibility for her to land something up there, she'll start taking formal courses in it.  She could get fluent in it faster than most people could.  If that makes any difference.  We've been considering Sweden because she has family there and because, as far as we can tell, the education system isn't as messed up as it is becoming down here.  (It was better than France, at least.  We'll see what happens next.)  Her aunt married a Swedish guy and she has a bunch of full-fledged Swedish cousins and whatnot.  That's Italians for you:  family is the number one draw.    She seems to have her heart set on there, but I'm figuring if we do leave we might go anywhere that:  1) would take us, and 2) doesn't suck.  The United States, the UK, Australia, etc.  I myself am American and if we were to go to America, all we would have to do is show up and do some paperwork (more onerous than elsewhere, but a sure bet at least), as far as simply moving there goes.  Of course, we would not go to America without solid jobs lined up ahead of time because the welfare state situation there is still quite dodgy, even after Obamacare.  We have a two year old.  We don't want to take the gamble.  Back home I've gone months at a time without health coverage of any kind.  It makes you look both ways when you cross the street, let me tell you.  I have heard that the UK is recruiting teachers from abroad right this very moment, as they have a shortage now, but it seems they're doing so almost entirely from Canada, Australia, NZ, etc.  I haven't seen anything about them getting people from elsewhere in the European Union.  I saw the big list and there is a demand for people who can teach Italian, but it's implied they have in mind Commonwealth citizens who in all likelihood speak it as a second language, as opposed to native speakers straight from the boot.  That's the long and the short of it.  Apologies for the the length and for it being TMI.  As for my own situation, that's a bit complicated and I can get to that later."

IWantOut,3b1xzg,karithescaryfairy,3,Thu Jun 25 08:49:35 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about whether you do IB or A-levels as far as universities are concerned. UK universities are very used to working out equivalent international qualifications, and some UK schools teach IB now. When I was that age (~10 years ago) and IB was first being used in the UK, it was actually seen as more challenging and therefore better from an admissions point of view than A-levels, but this may be very outdated.  Yes, universities in the UK are very expensive for non-EU students. You will have to look up individual unis/courses for current amounts, but expect ~£15,000 upwards a year in tuition fees, plus living expenses. Unless you're very wealthy or able to get loans, this is likely to be your biggest problem with attending university in the UK. I don't think a gap year working is going to cut it.  If you secure a place on a course at a 'highly trusted sponsor' university (basically just means it is a real university that the government trusts not to be running an immigration scam), getting a student visa is usually a pretty straightforward matter of proving you have the money, and proving you speak English. Exact requirements are likely to change before you reach this point, but you shouldn't worry about this bit probably.  At the moment, being a student in the UK/graduate of a UK university offers you nearly no advantage when it comes to immigration -- you have to qualify again for another visa, or go home. It's impossible to say whether this will still be the case when you are graduating (8? 10? years from now). Immigration changes a lot.

IWantOut,3azqqq,vietoushka,2,Wed Jun 24 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say try the working holiday visa first as you said. Getting those are very easy and free, and will give you both some time to grow together and you some time to see if you like New Zealand. Traveling to those places with a new found proximital closeness will be an eye opener in many ways likely, and I'd say best to take one step before planning the next.  Transferring from one visa to another shouldn't be too hard, but the best thing to do would be to visit the New Zealand consulate in NYC and just run through some hypotheticals with them. Barring someone showing up here who specifically deals in American>Kiwi travels and expatriation, the consulate will be best suited for these types of questions."

Not impossible at all: find a place that really wants you and has the experience with hiring foreign workers and you're in, but you have to find that place somehow.  Would you be up for another degree? A postgrad degree in the US allows you to live there for several years, work a little (which you'll have to do to fund yourself), and then look for work in the US afterwards. If you and the guy stay together and decide to get married, you can do that at any point during this student period and then you will receive a green card if your petition is approved. Degrees in your field offer full funding so you would not have to pay anything for this degree in terms of tuition fees: just rent and personal expenses, which should come out of a salary they give you.  Otherwise there is marriage, but uprooting your whole life and moving abroad for another person is, obviously, a big gamble, and not worth considering if you wouldn't have any desire to move to the US if you had not met this person."

If you're only interested in North America, do a little digging into Canada's startup visa programme.

IWantOut,3aw6x4,thunderstruck93,17,Wed Jun 24 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm Brazilian, and I live in Rio, and I also have lived in Melbourne, Australia.  Disclaimer: it's kind of a long rant, but my intention it to draw a detailed picture of Rio.  First of all, do you speak Portuguese? Because most Brazilians don't speak English out of touristic locations. So if you don't speak Portuguese it will be an insurmountable obstacle to get a job and transfer your life to Rio unless you are a very skilled professional.  Besides that, Brazil is terribly anti-business. I would say unless you are reasonably rich, decently well connected and familiarized with the bureaucracy, and have access to a good lawyer, it would be nearly non-viable to open you own business here. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18020623  Other than that, Brazil is entering an unbelievable economic crisis. We just had the worst May in terms of jobs in 23 years, 115 thousand work spots closed; worst inflation in 20 years; and the crisis is only beginning, it's predicted that it's only going to get worse until 2017. Things are pretty gloomy here, seriously.  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/702d7640-022c-11e5-92ce-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dwKIANGf  http://theweek.com/articles/557427/brazils-economic-catastrophe  Rio de Janeiro is one of the most affected states, because our economy is VERY reliant on oil exploration, and besides the internal crisis, oil prices have collapsed, and our largest company, Petrobras is involved in the largest corruption scandal in Brazils history, 20 billion dollars were stolen to fund political parties. So if Brazil is bad, Rio is terrible.  So the chances of you getting a job here are pretty slim.   While I know there is discrimination everywhere, have you experienced repeated/on-going discrimination from locals? The Lebanese community is very very strong in Brazil & Colombia, but I can't shake this feeling of what if something goes wrong/happens.   If you are Lebanese, chances are people won't even notice you are a foreigner, unless you start speaking. And to be honest, I've never heard of discrimination against immigrants in Brazil. Chances are people will be curious about you and  super-friendly, because everybody loves foreigners around here, you would be exotic, not discriminated. Also, yes, the Lebanese community here is very big.   I'm told that the people in both countries are very warm, friendly and optimistic which is the complete opposite in my current living situation   Latin people and Anglo-saxon people are pretty different, but the time I've been to Australia, I was better treated than in Rio, people were friendlier, more inclined to help, services were better, etc. People here are much less reserved, but in my perspective this is not necessarily good, since they won't respect your personal space either. Also Brazilians are warmer/friendlier, but it's double edged, since friendships are a lot less deep, and there is much less attachment than Australian friendships, so it's just different, IMO. And to be honest, I've found Melbournians to be much happier people than the average minimum-wage Brazilian worker.  Now, in terms of quality of life, which is a central point in comparing Australia to Brazil...  Brazil is a poor, violent, corrupt country.   This means we have 50 thousand homicides a year, or 26 per 100 thousand. Meanwhile Australia is only 1.2 per 100 thousand. Keep this in mind as an indicator of crime, there is also kidnapping, robbery, assault, rape...  Even educated people are poor in comparison to developed countries. The GNI per capita when adjusted to purchase parity in Brazil is 14750 USD, in Australia it's 42110 USD. So the average Australian makes 3 times more money than the average Brazilian. Also, minimum wage here ir 800 reais, abour 250 dollars a month, which is what the average non-college educated young worker makes.  For an example, an average engineer (5 year bachelors degree here) in Brazil will make 24 thousand dollars a year, while in Australia it's closer to 80~90 thousand dollars. So, it's also about three times more.  Also unemployment here is around 20% (and getting worse, this is before the crisis), maybe more. Australia is much lower, around 6%.   In terms of human development Brazil is 79th of the ranking, behind Serbia, Jordan, Iran... Australia is second, only behind Norway.  Also, cost of life in Rio, in a decent neighborhood is exorbitant for a third world country, it's comparable to decent cities in Europe, give it a look and you will see.   Other than that, services in general are crap, you will spend hours on end to solve even minor problems, specially banking. It's absolutely infuriating! Australia is miles ahead of Brazil in terms of services. And the way people treat you... I can't begin to explain, you would have to stand for 2 hours in a line of a Bank or wait all day for some repair guy and in the end of the day he doesn't show up, for three days in a row to even understand. And then do this again, again and again as it's a common thing in a Brazilian's life to understand it fully.  The city is a mess, with absurd traffic jams, unusable public transportation, which is plagued by violence, crappy sidewalks, bad public illumination, etc.  Public spaces are in a general state of disrepair. You won't have nearly as many parks, beaches, scenic walks, etc as in Australia, and the ones we have are usually also plagued with violence.  You live in one of the top 10 most livable cities of the world by any rankings, in a economic stable country in which a McDonalds worker makes more than an engineer in Brazil, in one of the safest places on earth. The climate is good, the city is beautiful, which would be a differential in Rio for, lets say, a Canadian, but not for an Australian. So I can't even begin to wrap my mind around why you would want to change your life from the first world to the third.  If you want to come here, enjoy the country for a while, learn Portuguese, make friends, by all means, this is a great idea, it's good to explore the world and it would be a huge cultural gain for you.  But planing to get a job, or even worse, to start a business, and live indefinitely here is in my opinion completely irrational (and I don't mean to be offensive by that), I don't see what you have to gain.   On other hand, Colombia is reforming its economy, growing really fast, and might be a promising country to move to.  But I can't say much more than this about them.  If you want to come to Latin America, I would either go to Chile (a developed country) or Colombia, as I said, it's very promising.  Best luck to you! Be it Rio, Bogotá or wherever else, I hope you find a place you enjoy.  Edit 1: One more thing, you would be 27 hours away from your family, it's very far, and making money in local currency, it's also very expensive. This would limit the time you spend with your relatives.  Edit2: I mean, don't get me wrong, Brazil is not a sub saharan african country neither. There are also good things, a relaxed style of living, good weather all year, nice touristic attractions, good food, good cultural scene, amazing history, multicultural society... But the way I view things, Australia is pretty similar on those aspects."

Rio de Janeiro is also very dangerous and you wouldn't enjoy nearly the amount of freedom to come and go that you do in Australia. You need to be street smart. In terms of discrimination, while locals wouldn't be unfriendly towards you and I'd say are actually particularly welcoming, you need to be wary of being clearly perceived as a gringo, i.e. being from a rich country. That means you might be targeted walking down the street for being mugged.  I'm not saying it's complete shit or anything like that. There are of course good things about living in Rio.

You should also take into account that most people don't speak English, thus I hope you speak Spanish rather well because if you don't that will certainly limit your job opportunities, you might be able to get a job teaching English but that's probably it, I you do speak Spanish and have a college degree getting a job shouldn't be much of a problem.  You also should know that the traffic in bogota is absolutely awful and there is a lot of insecurity if you are not careful in the streets (robbers etc..) and it has a high homicide rate, corruption is also pretty high in the country and the economy is very reliant in commodities so the recent economic boom is coming to an end.

As an engineer, getting sponsored for a work visa somewhere after graduation will be easier than with most other professions, but e.g., Germany allows graduates to remain in the country and apply for jobs as domestic applicants for up to two years (?) after graduation, whereas AFAIK Belgium doesn't.    Since you already know some French, have a look here to get started. The German equivalent is this site. Both have very low fees even for non-EU citizens, and a decent selection of English language programs at least at the Masters level (and some for undergraduates)."
IWantOut,3axdof,CountVonTroll,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:41:12 2015 UTC,"If you want to get to the 'west' without refugee status, you will most likely need to finish school first, unfortunately. After that, you'll have plenty of options - Canada (see here) and NZ (see here) come to mind as countries with relatively easy immigration (they have points systems and immigration is pretty much guaranteed after you get enough points) options after you have a degree.  As the situation in Syria right now is what it is, getting refugee status could be easy. I'm not sure if your Russian passport would make it harder, though (that is - you don't need protection as you could always go to Russia which is 'safe'), but as that door might be open for you right now, I personally would look closely at that option too even if it means 'refugee status'. That, after all, does not mean that you will be sent back home immediately if the war ends, it just means you get temporary residence and work permit in a country and can start working on learning the local language and culture, making new friends and connections and eventually get a proper residency. It's much easier to get residencies and such when you're already in the country.  Your Russian passport also opens up some possibilities - is Russia completely out? If so, it might still be useful in migrating to some of the former Soviet countries - but that's pure speculation as I don't know anything about immigration in the former SU and can't read Russian so.. It also could come in handy if you decide to take the refugee status route, as Russian passport will allow you to travel to many countries that you wouldn't be able to get with just a Syrian passport and one is typically required to be in the country when applying for asylum/refugee status.  Good luck!"

Well.  The next three are putting the cart in front of the horse.  And the wheels.  And... everything else.  To move to Finland, you will need a residency permit.  Common ones include: student, work, and family.    The work permits must be sponsored by a company in Finland who has extended a job offer to you.  This is basically only an option for those with university degrees and experience in their field.  Student residency permits are on the basis of being accepted by a Finnish university.  This is at the basic level free but universities can choose to charge tuition if the course is not conducted in Finnish or Swedish (courses not in those two languages are also limited in number at an undergraduate level).  However, to obtain the residency permit, you must demonstrate that you will have the funds to support yourself, which means that you will need to show at least 6700 euro at your disposal, though the recommended amount to make sure you pass this section is higher.

You can't just off and move to Finland.  You need to get a residence permit, which is essentially only possible through either working there or studying there.  As an 18 year old, there is virtually no way that you have the qualifications to be sponsored for a job abroad - to get in this way, basically always requires a bachelors degree at absolute minimum and proven professional work experience.  Citizenship is not required to live somewhere as a resident (people really don't understand the concepts of residency/citizenship whatsoever as far as I can gather), and it can only be applied for after many years of legal qualifying residence in a country, in the EU it's typically 5 years with few exceptions and residency while studying at undergraduate level usually doesn't count.  To get in for studies, this is of course possible, and Finnish public institutions offer free tuition currently even to non-EU students.  However you will need fluent Finnish to study in the vast majority of available programs, few are taught in English.  Finnish is insanely difficult to learn and you could perhaps reach some kind of proficiency after 2 years of full-time dedicated study if you're of the language prodigy type.

Technical schools around the country may have degree programs in business, tech, and nursing in English. If you're curious, OP, take a look at this website to get an idea of what you can study. There is a lot of competition for places in degree programs though, and you may need to visit Finland to take the entrance exams. I was a student at an AMK school until recently so I can try to answer any questions about the process.   It's also important to note that while there is no tuition for degree programs, you will also need to be able to prove to the government that you can support yourself through school before you will be granted a visa, the website I linked should give information about that in the tuition section.  The biggest thing I can stress if you want to move to Finland to get a degree is do not expect to learn to speak fluent Finnish while going to school without putting in a lot of extra time and hard work. In my experience and from what I have heard from people in other programs, you should NOT expect to have good Finnish courses as part of your curriculum, and people are not kidding around when they say that Finnish is a difficult language.  The Finnish classes I was in while studying met twice a week and really only covered the basics of the language, with the addition of teaching some technical vocabulary for my field. And this was going into a field where I would be interacting with Finnish speakers in Finnish as one of the most important aspects of my job. I myself am in an intensive class right now hoping to get to the point where I can converse well enough that I can find a job, and I know many others who are doing the same."
IWantOut,3as7xp,all_u_need_is_cheese,2,Tue Jun 23 10:52:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're absolutely right about language courses! I wasn't very clear with what I said. I live in Norway and I took a Norwegian course specifically for foreign researchers (I am a researcher at the University), and it was pretty crap (also 2 hours a week, just the basics). I was thinking that if OP was enrolled in the university he can take the University Finnish courses (not those offered within the program, the ""real"" ones from the Finnish department) for free. I have friends that did that with Norwegian instead of taking the course for researchers and they learned a LOT more, although academically it's quite heavy, so it's good to put these in semesters where you have a less intensive workload. :)"
IWantOut,3as7xp,mythologically,2,Tue Jun 23 11:33:05 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew more about that and if it's an option in Finland! I suspect that for someone living in Helsinki it might be.  What I'm doing this summer is taking a course through the Finnish government's unemployment integration program. I haven't started it yet but It's 5 days a week and 8 hours a day. Unfortunately because of the way Finnish bureaucracy works, it's not available to students, even if there was a way to schedule it in along with a student's schedule. My city does have several other less intensive evening courses in Finnish though, as well as a multicultural center that has language groups and good opportunities to practice."

Once you have that then you can start looking for a room, transport, etc.    I'm not sure what effect the Tories / UKIP are going to have on our ability to do this though, so I'd start looking pretty soon.

IWantOut,3ar9zj,coffeeandshutup,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:28:19 2015 UTC,"Well, it has one big benefit and one big drawback. The benefit: It pays pretty well, you can make between $10 and $20 an hour, depending on your experience/qualifications. I taught in a school before turning to online teaching, so my pay is decent and it wasn't that hard to get a job. The drawback: Class times are regular. I just moved to Romania this weekend, and I nearly killed myself trying to keep to my schedule while looking for an apartment and all that jazz. Some ""digital nomad"" jobs (I hate this term, I like to call myself an e-hobo, personally) don't have strict schedules like this, which makes them better suited for hopping from country to country. I write, too, and I much prefer it as far as deadlines go -- turn X words in at Y time on Z date, instead of talk to this person online at exactly 10:00 am on M, W, and F. The pay for writing doesn't tend to be as good, though, so one does what one has to do. I don't know if you have a CELTA or anything, but most reputable online schools will want it. They'll also ask that you keep a clean Web presence and always have access to good Internet. You might try to find private students online, too, perhaps through Elance or something. Hope that is helpful."

Ironically, it is pretty difficult for non-European westerners to gain long term entry into France.  I spent 12 years in France.  It's my first language and I have marketable skills such as programming as well as family over there and it would be difficult even for me to get in.

The jobs there tend to pay very well and if you do a good job of socking away money you can leave after a few years with a decent chunk saved up.

You can live as close or as far to the ocean as you want to. Mix that with the fact that Seattle Children's Hospital is number 6 in the country for Children's Hospitals. . You would most likely have to make weekend trips to the ocean if you wanted to work there, but you would still be close to a body of water with Puget Sound.   There is usually snow in the winter, but it how much we actually get and how it effects us varies year to year. Some years we get a lot of snow and things close down. Other years we don't get a lot and everyone's shoes are just muddy. Sometimes its a mix. Never a dull winter here in Washington state. The summers are a similar way. For the most part they hang out in the 70s-80s, but that depends on how close or far you are from the water.  I've only lived in three places in Washington, and only checked out housing costs for one of them, so my knowledge of exact pricing is slim. I know that the west side is pretty expensive, especially if you are close to a big city. There are plenty of suburbs around Seattle you could live in, but don't expect a cheap time. There are also a million other cities to live in that are way better than Seattle, I just keep referencing that because of the Children's Hospital.   I assume you know about our politics.

Look at Boston as the hub, where thousands of people commute to. Southern New Hampshire is within the commuter sphere, Manchester and even Portsmouth. Once you've hit Maine, you've gone too far. Inland from the Boston metro area there's dozens of cute little towns - impossible to name them all. Then down south you have Providence and then of course there is the Cape.

IWantOut,3apupq,suprc,5,Mon Jun 22 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a web developer living in Brisbane, so I hope I'll be of some use here! If you have any questions for me just PM me - I'm happy to help.  About Brisbane  Weather: Brisbane is extremely and uncomfortably hot and humid. I've met a lot of locals who love the climate of Brisbane, but I have never met a foreigner living in or visiting this city who didn't have difficulty tolerating the weather; the negative effects seem to more pronounced when the individual originates from countries with colder climates.   Expenses: Brisbane is middle of the range for expense when considering the whole of Australia; this still identifies the city as one of the most expensive to reside in on the planet. As a general figure, I live fairly frugally and avoid treats like eating out, lavish rental housing, expensive foodstuffs, and affluent purchases and still spend $1,300 AUD in monthly expenses alone (This includes: groceries (inc. food); energy (electricity and gas); rent (cheaper due to a share-housing arrangement); and, telecommunications (residential telephone, internet, and mobile phone charges). I will mention here that it shouldn't be very hard to find a place to live. Flatmates is a good option but I recommend also searching for rentals in with realestate.com.au or simply looking on gumtree.com.au as nickachu_ suggested.  Activities: Personally, I find Brisbane to be a small city with the attitude of a large rural town. There is a lot of excitement that Brisbane is entering the world stage as an international hot spot but ultimately very little momentum for actual change regarding governmental policy and the cultural disposition of the populace in order to establish Brisbane as such. Ultimately, the shops still open and close with the sun and the nightlife is limited and entirely focused around drinking profusely. There is a small and slowly building underground culture for musicians and the arts. The dinning and cafe is strong with quite a few options - Brisbane is developing a strong coffee-culture and you will find a lot of cafes far into the suburbs. The are a lot of sporting events in Brisbane and most persons follow NRL as their pass time. Another thing I should mention is that Brisbane isn't actually on the coast. In order to go to any beaches worth visiting you will spend either 1 - 1.5 hours via car to either the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast.   Employment: Finding work in Brisbane is tough, especially so as a web developer. To give you an understanding of the difficulties, majority of my income as a web developer comes from clients outside of Australia. In addition to this, I spent several months looking for a web developer position with very little luck before deciding to establish my own business activities and seek clients on my own; I moreorless had to create my own job as digital agencies are struggling to make ends meet. The situation of poor employment opportunities isn't limited to web developers, I know of a lot of skilled professional persons who are struggling to either keep their positions or find a new position. The work culture is poor for the average worker. You can expect very long commutes to and from work and a minimum of 40-60 hours a week. ""Part-time"" isn't looked upon kindly by majority of businesses.  About Melbourne  Not living and never having lived in Melbourne, I don't have as much to say but I will impart what I know. Melbourne has erratic weather but is generally much cooler than Brisbane and other Australian cities. I'm told you should prepare yourself for potentially all four seasons in one day (it can be very cold and raining at one part of the day and then suddenly warm and sunny the next). Melbourne is regarded as the most expensive city in Australia. As a rough estimate, add 40% to my Brisbane living expenses - I'm told that this is a fairly good figure to go by. Since Melbourne has a hyper-inflated micro economy, jobs typically pay more than elsewhere and your pay should scale to match your increased living expenses. Melbourne is seen as the ""cultural city"" of Australia, having the most developed scenes in a lot of capacities. In addition to this, it is also seen as the web development factory of Australia. As a web developer you will have both more opportunities and competition in Melbourne than any other city in Australia. Although, Sydney is a close second.  What I Humbly Suggest  I recommend you definitely consider living in Melbourne while you are over here and visit Brisbane during Spring or Autumn. As someone who wants to ""get out"" I don't recommend Brisbane, but ultimately that's up to you. This subreddit has taught me just diverse people interests are when it comes to their living environment.  Again, PM me if you have any more questions - I'm happy to help."

Brisbane is HOT and humid as hell, especially in the summer. I loved it there though, lived in a house for 3 months as well as a hostel for 6 whilst working there as a cook.

IWantOut,3arc7q,The_Miracle_Berry,5,Mon Jun 22 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"Something I actually know about! I was in the same boat as you: British mom, born well after '83, raised and living in the States.  First off, as /u/Cato_Keto_Cigars alluded to, easiest way to claim your citizenship is by getting a British passport. Apply for it online. You're gonna need plenty of forms, things like your proof of birth/US citizenship, your mother's British birth certificate, adoption forms, etc (I got her Passport and adoption forms off her. If yours gives you hers make sure she knows she won't get it back for 2-3 months).   What they didn't say is while you're technically already a citizen, and have been since birth, you need proof. Best route is getting a British Passport. So no, no civil ceremony or anything like that, but you're gonna have fees, same as you did when getting your US passport.  You're also gonna need a sponsor. I know Cato said there's no character check, and that's true to a degree. It's not rigorous. But you need someone who's not related to you to sign on your behalf. If I remember correctly, they recommend someone reputable, such as a religious figure, local community leader/politician/businessman, etc. I used a family friend who's doctor with his own practice. Just think of the most reputable family friend you have who can claim to have known you a good long while and attest to your upstanding character.  Get the payment right. Down to the penny. If it's off in any way, they'll send it back to you (pretty sure with a further fee for wasting their time) and you'll be set back like 6 weeks.  In short, just follow the instructions on the website. It's not difficult, but it can seem overwhelming if you don't take it step by step. Throw all the forms in a big brown envelope, take it down to the post office, and you're set. Then you wait.   I'd just add in case you were thinking of packing up and bolting anytime soon... do all this while you're in the States. Stay living here until it's all done and you've got your UK passport in hand. If you try and book it over there on your US passport without proof of UK citizenship, you're gonna have a rough time at customs when you land (unless you've booked a return trip or other departing flight within the 6 months they give foreigners). I did, and spent ages in detention while they looked for records of my mom to prove I was a citizen. Plus, and I'm assuming your mom's living in the States, it's much easier to coordinate with her and get all the forms and stuff, along with giving their offices in London a residence and way to reach you.  Any questions, don't hesitate to PM me. I did all this maybe 2 years ago, so some of the details are a bit fuzzy, but I'll help if I can."

Ended up in London, terribly informed, looking for some kind of office to go to for proof of citizenship. Ended up in a hostel with a pub for a few weeks... better to get things done now, while you're in the US. 2-3 months (maybe it was less? Can't remember. Wasn't more than that, though) from now you'll be glad you got the forms sent off today. Can't stress enough though, get all the documents and payments the website says you'll need, and triple check that they're all in that envelope before you send it off.  Oh yeah, and what /u/cornfedpig about the proper sized passport photos. Gotta have them right.  The sponsor's a pain, but it shouldn't be too hard. You can probably find someone who fits the bill, really anyone who's reputable and established in your city, and who's known you for at least a few years. If not, maybe someone who you're on good terms with who might exaggerate how long they've known you? Truthfully, I don't think it matters that much. You're just looking to pass a bureaucratic requirement. Best to have all your bases covered of course."

I didn't really want to go to college but my parents made me because it was the thing to do and they were never able to.  My first mistake was going to a for-profit art school (NEIA).  Every semester was like 12 grand or some bs.  I didn't know the value of a dollar and I barely read the loans I was signing for.  Then the advisors always recommend taking out more for books or buying a new laptop, which we of course do.  Then I changed my major a few times because again I didn't want to go to school because I didn't know what I wanted.  Then I realized how much money I was paying to stay here and got out.  Went to a smaller and much more affordable college that recently became a University.  That was great, I did 5% at classes for less money but I was still doing the same stupid shit. One day when I was signing up for the new semester I noticed my loan kept getting denied. I asked and they said I exceeded my max borrow limit.    It blew my mind because all my dumbassery caught up with me.  I goofed off in school, hit my loan max, and I currently have no degree in sight and I work at a cell phone store for minimum wage.  I left school, took the hardship deferment, and studied for a certification.  Got a temp job doing customer service for double what I was making, nearly fucking cried when I got it.  After that I did more and more temp jobs earning more money.  Finally got a full time permanent job at an IT company and I was able to actually afford my loans fully with no heartache.

You will never again be able to live or work in the US - the chance of being granted a green card or work visa as an ex-citizen is practically zero.      In addition, you may have to pay an exit tax that could amount to a significant figure, depending on the size of your estate.   Finally, you are at the whims of geopolitical circumstance when it comes to your future, US senators have several times introduced laws to ban ex-citizens from ever visiting, though they've never been passed.   There's a reason so few Americans ever give up citizenship, and most of those who do are older people who inherited it at birth and have never even been to the US, or who drop citizenship to get that of another country that doesn't allow dual citizenship (as in Japan).   It's because the advantages of having some place to go back to outweighs the costs.  The job and business opportunities in what remains the wealthiest country on earth are open to you.  And most civilised countries tax income and capital gains at rates higher than America, so you end up not paying much tax at all due to the fact that there is no double taxation.    As a US citizen who has spent 52 of the last 59 years of my life OUTSIDE the US, I cannot imagine ever giving up citizenship.

I saw the amount of work and the number of years my parents went through to obtain a citizenship to what really can be the greatest country on earth and I could never imagine simply tossing away something like that. Perhaps being born with the citizenship you guys don't appreciate it's value so much, but having seen the process needed to obtain something and having seen how coveted it is to me it would feel like a grand waste to simply toss it aside. Also, your children would be born as US citizens, and that is something quite valuable if they ever want to go back and work or live in the US. If they ever wanted to go there, the sheer advantage of having a citizenship will be immense, especially considering how much the US fights to keep immigrants out (it took my parents 15 years on a green card). And if you ever want to go back, you have to go back as an immigrant, which is an ENTIRELY different experience then as a citizen. You would never be able to get it back either.

It's just that it's not all that difficult to comply with for the average citizen living abroad.

Even if your transcripts check out and you have the money to attend a boarding school, I'm not sure if it would be what you expect.

The lack of job opportunities/low salaries won't impact me in the short/medium term (I'm a remote worker with a great relationship with my employer, a company that's seen steady growth for a long time). I'm not stupid, though -- I know the economic impact on our future is absolutely enormous. I try to think of it as akin to working in a career you love, despite the low pay -- except in this instance, we're making the decision to move somewhere that we've visited and loved, despite the financial impact.  Most importantly, though, my fiance has a really strong preference toward the mild weather and living in a city that's a slower pace than where we're at now (NYC). I haven't visited Toronto in ages but I recall loving it -- so I'd be happy to live there.  But it's a matter of compromise: my wife doesn't really follow the news and she really didn't have any sort of drive to leave the U.S., period -- whereas I'm pretty much horrified on a regular basis by the American government and key aspects of American culture (despite growing up here) and find the prospect of putting down serious roots and raising my children here as intolerable.

Every time I go to the market here in Ukraine, it's an adventure.  I need that in my life, and my home country didn't really offer that.  Still, it's a great place, I'm proud that I was born there, and I recommend everyone to visit.  I think people are pretty unique and it's important to find a place that suits you.

Of course it was way different during the protests last year and the fighting on the Maidan - the unrest was much more visible and apparent, even here in L'viv.  Police headquarters were vandalized, a government building was occupied (complete with barricades and scary dudes with masks and fatigues walking around).  Now though, it's much more subdued.  People aren't happy, but there's no active protests because it's difficult to determine where to direct them.  Obviously, Putin is an easy target - but the current Ukrainian government isn't doing much to help the situation (whether they can or not is a different story) and people are generally dissatisfied with the lack of visible change from the government side of things.    The economy is still in the toilet, the local currency has stabilized but will probably sink lower, and people are just frustrated.  However, there is a large amount of tourism, IT, and remittances from people working in the EU (Poland is only ~60km away) which keeps L'viv afloat.  Compared to some of the eastern cities, it's in far better shape.  So yeah, it's there, but not the ""riot in the streets"" sort of unrest.  More like ""I want to find a job that pays more than $200 a month"" sort."

Now I still teach, as well as do some property management and consulting/training for IT companies in the area.  I'm not paid in dollars, but I'm paid the equivalent in the local currency.  I got my clients by working at schools, getting good at it, then going freelance and offering lessons online/marketing directly to IT companies (i.e. the businesses which need English and have money).

Living in Denmark for the past 3 years (I'm from the US), I find it incredibly annoying now when I go back to the US and talk with left-leaning folks, because pretty much every single one of them thinks this is some kind of paradise on earth and they say they'd want to leave the US and move here, even though I'd say 99% of the time, they have no genuine intention whatsoever of trying.  Most people only consider the few socialist utopia points that are hammered on in the media, and we all know what those things are.  But they have absolutely no concept of the other difficulties of living in a foreign country with foreign everything and different standards for just about everything in life.  They have no real idea of what it's like to have ~70% of your income going back to the state (once you count in the 25% sales tax on everything, taxes on taxes, and that 80% of your utility bills are also taxes).    And the fact that politics can be idiotic in socialist countries as well, as the right-wing swing from Denmark's parliamentary elections last week showed.  You can never feel safe being an immigrant here, and the thin thread linking Denmark to the EU (and to any rational treatment of migrants) can snap at any moment.  Even the pro-immigrant left-wing party political ads talk about foreign workers being beneficial mainly because they're a source of tax dollars for Denmark's aging population.  So don't be fooled - if you move here, that's what you're coming here to do.  You're not being let in to suck off the system like an average Dane."

We are big, wide open spaces, lots of opportunities if you are willing to work. Cold as heck though, unless you stick to BC or some of Ontario, where most of the people are. I guess it depends on what you want or expect. Canada had become very diverse so you will almost always be able to find like minded people, no matter how you think. Finding work is easy in some places, hard in others. Wages are generally not great, you won't be saving, but you can almost always make due. I do love Canada, despite its downsides."

But what confuses me is seeing people wanting to move from the US to Canada. How much different do they think it's going to be?    Granted, as much as I LOVE the Pacific Northwest, I am grateful to be Canadian. I wouldn't mind living in parts of the states, but being a citizen of that country would really suck, comparatively. Healthcare is number one, and as a student the cost of a degree in the US is sickening. It's not free here either..we're not Europe...haha... :'(    But student debt is horrible, it is just far more affordable at Canadian universities. Plus, the US government is utterly horrendous. I'm just not sure what people who 'want out' to Canada are really expecting. And the winters here are no joke. That's ultimately why I want out."

If I was anything but white I would (depending on where I was from already) consider how much of this anti-immigrant and racist mentality I could take in my daily life.  The second largest party (DPP) has said things like Muslim's are like cancer cells, Homosexuality is against nature and Danish culture, That Muslim fathers beat and kill their daughters while turning a blind eye on the uncle who rapes them. They want closed borders and an even tighter immigration policy.  Denmark might be portrayed as the happiest country in the world, but there's a huge divide going on and the elections shocked the entire country.

We're spread out so far population wise, it's a neccesity, but the trips are long, crowded and the timetables are stupid. I live 45minutes by train from the center of Melbourne.

Our creatures fill the same evolutionary niches that yours do, but for example, there's the Hyena and Coyote. OR for us, Dingo. Same niche, different evolutionary paths to get there. It was a super interesting read back when I read up about it, apparently I've not retained as much knowledge as I thought and I'm also sleep deprived right now, but yeah, Australia evolved Wombats and Kangaroos and Koalas where as the rest of the world evolved much more similar animals since you guys all have a much similar climate than us, and are much closer together.

Of course these aren't necessarily people who're sleeping in doorways, but maybe living in cars, shelters, or in unsuitable arrangements like friends/family couches.

IWantOut,3ajf4d,chickenstrip69,21,Sun Jun 21 14:45:54 2015 UTC,"I want to elaborate a little more on this. Obviously the US is a better option than most places (third world, etc.) on earth, and I don't want to sound like coming to America is a horrible idea (cuz frankly, for a lot of people in a lot of circumstances, it is a very good option), but I feel like America really projects this false perception to the rest of the world of what it's like here. Generally, what you see in movies/tv/internet/etc. about America in other countries are largely only the good things about it. The U.S. is very good at shaping the public's perception (both in- and outside the country) towards its favor, and how nice it is, good for making money, how ""free"" it can be here; but there's rarely a presentation of the other side of things. Sure, you can make money here and pay very little in taxes, but what about the people that can't afford to stay alive, deal with homelessness, or have no real opportunity in their lifetime due to circumstances outside of their control. There are many shitty aspects here that are alive and well that a developed nation should really not have any sort of problem with.  A had a roommate from Nigeria who came here to go to med school, and explained that back in his home country, everyone there thought America was paradise, and that everyone that comes here makes a ton of money. Then the whole Michael Brown thing happened and he was amazed at how many fucked up problems we're dealing with that we shouldn't have (again, we're a first-world nation, we shouldn't be afraid of people killing us that are supposed to be there to help us). The economic issue are a growing problem here too. My jaw is still in a constant drop at how normal/expected it is here to go put yourself in $50,000+ debt at the start of your adult life to get an education and essentially build the rest of your life around loans and paying things off later. Seriously, the whole lifestyle here is immersed in the idea of purchasing things on loans and crawling out of it (or not) later. I'm not even gonna touch on the healthcare issue here, so anyone wanting to come here and not worry about dying, good luck with that.  The culture is relatively the same everywhere (this might get a lot of flack, but imagine going to every single part of the country and seeing the same stores, same restaurants, same music, same everything with a different scenery) for such a huge country. It is hands down the most commercial-oriented (look now! huge deal! great savings! Buy 3 get 1 50% off! etc.) country on earth that exchanges any potential for cultural/social advancement with making money and taking advantage of consumers. It is a very individual-minded country (which is expected, the country was built upon the idea of an individual coming here to make it for themselves and their family, regardless of what they needed to do), and this is reflected in the lack of social programs such as welfare, public transportation, healthcare, etc. (I found my way out of my problems, you can too!). This also created the competitive nature of the country, and beating out those around you, instead of trying to achieve common goals together (this is really my least favorite thing about it).  I think it's a really great country to come and visit for vacation, lots of different kinds of places/geography, but you really need a car (with the exception of a few cities) if you want to live here too. And traveling within the country is hard too, as flying is still pretty expensive within the country.  Overall, it can be a great option, but depending on your circumstances it can also be a really horrible option. There's the potential for basically anything here and achieving a lot and being successful, but there is also the potential for complete failure, dying in the streets, or getting shot by your own police (not trying to exaggerate this factor, but it really shouldn't happen at all).  Not the worst place in the world, but far from the best, and frankly far from what the country is capable of."

I left the army as soon as my 4 years was up, with roughly $30k debt, and fuck all to show for it.   While that isn't the army's fault, it was entirely my poor management of finances, I still wouldn't have come out much better off. You still pay for food and accomodation, it's just far less than what you pay out of the army. So after everything had been deducted from my pay, there wasn't mich left. The only time when you will make good money, is if you do a tour of Afghanastan. My friends that went returned with roughly $80 - $100k in the bank, and almost all of them blew it on new cars, bikes, boats and other worthless shit. But as far as I know, we've pulled out? Or are pulling out? So it's unlikely you'll go.  On top of that, there is a lot of social pressure to spend your weekends partying, and generally blowing money left right and centre.

Your more likely to do deployments and earn more money and it attracts a better demographic.  One of the pros/cons of the forces is you HAVE to be social. It's all based around team work, and if you're not a team player your time will be absolute hell. I'm not a social butterfly, and don't have the best social skills, but I can pretty much get along with anyone and go with the flow. So it was good for me to be forced to develop better social skills.   Here's my advice to you. Which was actually advice from a 21yr old American girl I met off tinder and spent a few weekends with before she left back to Asia. Save up $5,000 (more if you can) and go to SE Asia without a plan, other than trying to survive there as long as you possibly can. And see as much as you can. You will learn how to budget, get around a foreign country with the minimum, and survive with the minimum really. You'll also get a taste for travel which will give you drive to come back and work your butt off to get out of this country for good!!   To save the cash I reccomend going into labouring, there is so many jobs in unskilled labour, and they suck, but they pay well for that reason."

Never once had a problem with not having a PIN in the US.  Also I get the impression that European credit cards have less fraud protection - e.g. you can easily call up a credit card company in the US and have thousands of $ in fraudulent charges reversed, with absolutely nothing charged to you - the credit card company just takes the hit.  Good luck getting that done in Europe, you'll get nothing back.

Well... if that were the whole story, then there'd be no need for anyone to naturalize ever.  One of the main issues is participation in your adopted country's democracy. Germany does not allow resident non-citizens to vote at any level. Not local, not state, not national, not EU (unless you're already an EU citizen from elsewhere). Again, not every EU nation has this restriction. It's on an arbitrary country-by-country basis, which casts the whole European Union thing into question.  Another is stability. There are circumstances where ""permanent"" residency (via a Niederlassungserlaubnis) can be revoked, such as spending too much time outside of the country.  Finally, being a resident non-citizen doesn't give you all the same freedom of movement. A US citizen who lives in Germany can visit the UK visa-free, because of that original citizenship.

That is, if you get a temporary visa to another country, can't get it renewed and must leave that country, you may have to return to Sri Lanka instead of the US in this instance.  Or if you just realize that you miss your life in the US or want to return, you could have major issues doing so."

I don't have family here anymore and I'm aware that leaving the country will trigger a ban on re-entry.   I have become increasingly uneasy with the rhetoric surrounding immigration in Washington.

If I can get create a stable life elsewhere (ie. establish residency), I'm willing to do that.

IWantOut,3abm15,throwaway604778,16,Fri Jun 19 20:43:10 2015 UTC,"UK -> Thailand (Bangkok) - been here almost a decade  Pros:   Great value for money for basically anything local: services, food & drink, transport, clothes etc local travel opportunities - some genuinely stunning scenery around here with beach islands to the south and mountains to the north international travel opportunities - Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Myanmar all border on Thailand and are an hour's flight away. A little further afield but still within 2-3 hours flying time, Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the Philippines, etc. Labour is cheap, so you can have hired help that you'd never be able to afford in the West - maid/cleaning lady, driver, nanny etc. Thai food is fantastic - and starts at $1/plate Bangkok also has a great mix of international food as well, so plenty of variety Craft beer is taking off over here, although not cheap (see below) I can't remember what being cold feels like What would be luxury services elsewhere are affordable here - VIP cinemas with reclining sofa-beds and table service. Luxury hotels. Massage/spas. A couple of local restaurants just made the world's 50 best restaurants list (both in the top 25). People are happier here. Walk down any major road in London and count the smiles on passers-by. Now do the same here. The ratio is hilarious.   Cons:   Imported products can be crazy expensive due to high  taxes - a markup of 200-300% on wine is common, and although there are plenty of places to drink cheap beer, there are more and more places to drink crazy expensive beer too (i.e. more expensive than London) Thai bureaucracy makes the French seem efficient. Avoiding this at all costs is a major part of having a happy time here - it's imperative to absolutely minimise the amount of time you spend dealing with Immigration, Labour Dept, etc. Corrupt police - won't be noticeable to most people, but if you spend enough time here you'll eventually be shaken down for not carrying your passport or similar Draconian anti-drug laws including the death penalty for locals, and life sentences for foreigners - yes, even for pot. Doesn't really affect me (if you need to be on drugs to have a good time in Bangkok, you're doing it wrong), but I know this would put a lot of people off. The previous point means you can probably buy your way out of trouble, but it's still a risk. Nobody knows how to drive, and nobody cares Taxi drivers can be absolute fucksticks. Uber is a godsend. Although it's extremely safe for foreigners (I've been here through 2 coups and various street protests), the volatile political situation means you can never really predict what's going to happen next   Overall it's a no-brainer, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.

Loaded with oil, sugar, msg, etc. Just like everywhere else you gotta pay for high-quality food; yes you can get a meal for $1 but you can also get a something of the $1 menu at any fast food chain in America.  Culture - Thai culture is... interesting. It's nice. The laid back attitude. The friendliness. But it's also a huge headache because of these same reasons. The laid back attitude means nothing ever gets done, Thailand is the land of 80%; if something is 80% done then you're finished. So many thing here just don't make any sense whatsoever. Also the whole concept of saving face is really frustrating. If you offend someone or make a mistake you'll never be told, you'll juts be fire or ostracized or whatever.

In the proximity of Cluj, you can visit Salina Turda (really cool place despite the obvious prejudices about a literal salt cave - http://imgur.com/a/wmsQJ#9H2DsNE) and also the Scarisoara Ice Cave - went there as a kid, a cool place I'd say.  I live in Oltenia, specifically Gorj county. Not much to see here, except for the works of a famous sculptor, Brancusi. One of his works sold for like 30 mil $, so if you're into that kind of stuff, you're gonna have a good time, otherwise you'll get bored quickly.  Some places that are a must, imo, are the Corvin Castle - absolutely stunning and Sarmizegetuza, which was the capital of Roman Dacia. I'm a history enthusiast, so I might be biased in this regard. Other locations worth mentioning in the same category are Bran Castle (lots of Dracula stuff, taken to a somewhat absurd level, but hey, it's worth a look). Peles Castle is also another definite must, along with the Danube Delta (it's absolutely gorgeous, if you've got some buddies go camping here. Dunno about fishing laws, but I'm guessing it's possible. You're gonna have the time of your life. Beautiful and relaxing).  There are also lots of monasteries I've been told are worth visiting, but I'm personally not into the whole religion thing so it does nothing for me.

Raskol is a Tok Pisin (Pidgin English) word derived from the English word rascal and is currently used in PNG to refer to gang members or criminals in general.  Raskol gangs first emerged in Port Moresby in the 1970s, largely associated with the growth of urban squatter settlements in Port Moresby that consisted of recent migrants from the rural areas of the country and their children. Unemployment was (and remains) high in the settlements, with most employment in the informal sector, and educational opportunities very limited.  Similar to criminal gangs in western urban centres such as Los Angeles, London, and Paris, criminal gangs emerged as a mechanism through which uneducated and unemployed urban youth in PNG sought a sense of self-worth and security by associating with others who share their deprivation. In a country where betel nut, marijuana, and other psychoactive recreational drugs are widely accessible at an early age, these drugs are an often-cited contributor to the erratic behaviour of raskol gangs. Widespread alcoholism due to Melanesian genetic susceptibility and cultural attitudes towards alcoholism may also be a contributor.  Many PNG criminal law enforcement officials accept drunkenness as a legal defence in domestic violence cases.

In most places people are willing speak a little English for a short while, but in groups of mostly French people they will still speak French to each other.  French isn't the hardest language to learn though, and it has quite a bit of vocabulary in common with English. I don't really speak it though, just had some French in school that I forgot most of."

I've lived here three for three year and a half years (1 Paris and 2.5 La Rochelle) and I don't hear them. Nor do I hear the fat American jokes. I generally don't encounter rude store employees, though they're not as lapdog-friendly as in the US.  Linguistic arrogance? I hear this from people repeatedly, but again, I've had no encounter with this (though I did in Quebec). I'm just an average looking guy, my accent is thick enough that the French misunderstand me from time to time, and I'm hardly fluent in the language. People tell me repeatedly that the French are arrogant about their language, but I've never encountered it, so I'm puzzled that people would say that.  Yeah, salaries are lower across Europe in general; there is a lot more casual racism; and fewer choices in food. None of these are things that truly impact me on a regular basis, so maybe it's just your situation? I earn decent money (and did even when I was working for someone else), my wife is black (and we don't experience racism, though some assume at first that she's not French), and lots of tourists where I live, so I have decent food choices.  And stifled by tradition? Yeah, that's a bit annoying. One lady was shocked, absolutely shocked, that I suggested a plate of fries for a snack while at the beach with our children. After all, it wasn't dinner time and she said (in French) ""but the calories!"" Her jaw literally fell open. That's the sort of crap I find annoying."

IWantOut,3abm15,superdiscodancefloor,13,Fri Jun 19 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Australian currently based in Malaysia.  Cons   It is hot and humid all the time. You can't go outside without being drenched in sweat. Walking places is hard. Partly this is the humidity but also pedestrians appear to not be a priority for city planning, property development etc. This is especially painful with a pram/stroller. Foot paths/side walks are often absent or in terrible condition. Lots of very busy roads literally have no way for pedestrians to cross. There are 2-3 lanes of fast moving traffic going in either direction without so much as an island in the middle. Some roads have an island but the island has been completely filled with plants so you have to find spots where the plants have already been trampled down by pedestrians and carry your pram over. One big road near us has a waist high concrete barrier down the middle. To cross you run across the lanes on one side, climb up on the barrier, wait, then run across the lanes on the other side. It is like a deliberate effort to persuade people to never walk anywhere. Even big malls frequently have foot paths that take you to the car park but no further so if you want to walk home with your shopping you have to cut through garden beds and walk along roads. Because so many people drive everywhere the traffic is frequently terrible in more built up areas. Beyond being inconvenient the accumulated exhaust can get really bad. Stifling heat and humidity plus a huge number of stationary cars idling their engines does not make for a good time for anyone. Littering is a big problem (imo). Beaches, rivers etc are frequently disgusting due to the volume of trash. Areas with big hotels are usually ok as they seem to have their staff go out and pick up trash but otherwise, if its near a population center, things can get pretty bad. Not everyone does it of course but you will see people make literally zero effort to look for a trash receptacle before simply dropping their garbage where they stand. Where trashcans etc exist they frequently don't get emptied often enough so you may find them overflowing.   Pros   Reasonably affordable accommodation. It isn't as cheap as Thailand but we are currently staying in a very nice 3 bedroom furnished apartment in a fairly new high rise building with a pool, gym and playground and its costing us maybe 2/3 of what our unfurnished 2 bedroom apartment with no facilities costs back in Australia. Food is cheap and tasty. There is lots of good Malay, Chinese and Indian food around in particular. You can even get most of it delivered to your door for the cost of the food plus $2-3. We have a young child so being able to get dinner and lunch for the next day delivered when we can't be bothered cooking is awesome. As an added bonus you order via an app on your phone rather than having to have a long awkward phone conversation that results in you getting something other than what you thought you ordered. Taxis are pretty cheap. Again, you can order one via a phone app. You specify where you are and where you are going (locations are shown on a map so you know they are correct), you get an estimate of cost, you can see your taxi approaching on the map and the driver has your destination already in google maps so there is no confusion about where you are going. Kuala Lumpur (the national capital) is a major air travel hub. In particular it is Air Asia's home. That means you can pick up really cheap flights around the region."

I have never experienced it as a young single person, I am in my mid 30s and married, so I have no idea what it is like in terms of night life and dating. It is a slightly odd city in that you tend to catch taxis a lot so in my head it consists of a bunch of islands, areas I know, but I have little idea where they all are relative to one another. I am somewhere I know, I get in a cab, we drive along a tangle of roads and pop out somewhere else I know.  If you are female you will need to get comfortable with being looked at a lot regardless of how conservatively you dress. This is probably the number one complaint of females who have spent time in KL, feeling watched a lot of the time. I am not entirely sure of the reason but there are just a lot of dudes hanging out in some parts and they frequently have a different idea of what constitutes an acceptable amount of open staring/leering.  It is a perfectly fine city and makes a great jumping off point for exploring the region. If you want a big city experience I would also recommend Bangkok. Or somewhere in Taiwan if you are prepared to go further afield. We only spent 2 months there but we loved Taiwan."

Pros   Great beaches Great weather Good looking people Cheap beer Lots of places to visit within Brazil Generally friendly towards gringos Very relaxed attitude   Cons   Very relaxed attitude.  This is a ""pro"" when you want it to be, but this is a ""con"" in every other aspect of your life.  Things move slow here, if at all.  Everything is done at the bare minimum.  You will never see something and think to yourself ""wow, what a well made thing"". The food is very bland and there's too much salt.  Parents die in their 50s.  Living in Brazil has turned me into a great cook, however. It's violent.  I know there is someone out there like ""oh but all cities have violence"".  Yes, but it's not depraved like Brazil. The infrastructure is very bad.  The bays and rivers are very polluted and there is garbage everywhere.  All you will ever hear is ""oh, that's Brazil.  Oh, that's just how it is in developing countries"". Brazil is no longer developing!  There's no growth.  It's shrinking.  HSBC is leaving the country.  The value of the Real has fallen almost 35% since I've been here.  I am very, very lucky to get paid in USD.  If I were paid in BRL it wouldn't be worth living here. In my experience, Brazilians try too hard to be clever in business or working with money, etc.  I would never buy a used car or washing machine in Brazil.  It's like everyone is looking for ways to screw someone over but they're not clever enough to actually execute it.  If you read through the Gringo Buy / Sell ads on CL or Facebook you will see exactly what I mean.  It's annoying.   It's been a wonderful experience but I have been here too long.  I think I've been here about a year longer than necessary.  I'm planning to leave.  Brazil is rough.  There is a meme with the backpackers coming through ""Brazil is not for beginners"".  The reality of life here is a constant struggle unless you are rich and/or a Petrobras employee.  It's a very real existence.  Life is cheap, depending on your neighborhood.  There are many people that don't have the mobility that I do.  There's a feeling of hopelessness in many areas of Brazil.      A lot of the rich gringos that move here seem to really get off on the idea of hiring poor Black women to clean their houses.  It's weird.  I have nothing in common with any of the people at the usual expat hangouts.  Perhaps that's why my life here has been difficult?  I'm kidding.  It's worth it if you can handle it.

IWantOut,3abm15,olympiaa,15,Fri Jun 19 05:08:42 2015 UTC,"I'm an American living in Germany (Munich) for more than a decade now.   Pros   Healthcare : This is a no brainer. I pay a reasonable amount per month for my public insurance (300€) and have access to [mostly] free healthcare at point of service. I really only have to pay a little extra for certain medicines and surcharges for private rooms at a hospital, etc. My husband was involved in an accident a few years ago and was airlifted to the hospital, spent several days in the ICU and then a few more days in a normal room. His out of pocket cost? 50€. I am thankful that we never have to fear a huge unexpected medical bill.  Work : I have 30+ days of vacation per year.  Bureaucracy : I put this as a pro and con because I've had good and bad experiences with german bureaucracy. I don't mind the bureaucracy so much to be honest. I would pick going to the Landratsamt over the DMV in America any day. Education : I can send my children to a good neighborhood school and when they want to attend university they can go for free. Public transportation : I don't use it so much, but if I wanted to it would be very convenient.   Cons   It's expensive : Everything is expensive. We just bought a house and I am horrified by what a lot of things cost. There are very few cheap or reasonably priced things here. Cars are also very expensive to keep (fuel, insurance, taxes, etc.) Deutsche Telekom : I am convinced Telekom is the worst company in the world. I've dealt with Comcast/Time Warner/ AT&T, etc. before. Telekom takes the cake seriously. If I had any choice not to work with them I would, but unfortunately they are the only company offering phone and internet in my area... Bureaucracy : Pro and con. It can be annoying and frustrating to deal with going to a million different little offices with millions of different forms and documents in a very specific order when those offices have the worst office hours. Seriously 8:30am-11:00 and 2:00-4:00 pm? Really? Closed on Wednesdays? Availability / Opening Hours : Going along with my comment just above. Closed on Sundays, closed after 8pm, not open until 9:30 or even 10? It's horribly inconvenient to do anything here because things just aren't open. I found a Baumarkt recently that opens at 7am and accepts credit cards! I go out of my way to shop there because I want to support stores like that.  Credit Cards : Why can't I use my credit card to buy a television at Media Markt/Saturn? This pisses me off beyond belief. I have rewards credit cards and I can't shop anywhere with them because you can only use cash or EC cards. Ridiculous.  Weather : It's June and I'm wearing long pants, long sleeves and winter slippers because it's so cold outside. Rainy, grey and cold. The weather here can be beautiful, but it can also be absolutely miserable.

Signs telling you what you can and can't do everywhere. Little to no consumer protection. Buyer beware. Speed cameras....everywhere. And a ticket is well over $100. That said, everything is expensive; ""Australia Tax"". Software, internet, phone, electronics, vehicles, housing, going out to eat, fuel, clothing... Strange trading hours here in QLD, although that's slowly changing.  Lack of online shopping options (no Amazon), although options are increasing. Unaffordable housing. Exponentially increasing rent. Poor selection of food at extraordinarily high prices. Going out is usually disappointing or a wallet buster. Night life around here is mediocre and centralized. Limited diversity and numbers of venues, focus on getting smashed as quickly as possible.    All in all, I really enjoy it here. Everywhere has pros and cons. The cons here basically mean you live off a slightly different budget, but can still have a lot of fun, live well, and meet great people along the way."

Drive slower, buy less stuff, find other forms of entertainment like camping on secluded beaches with a fire and good friends, nobody around for a few kms...diving in warm water with sharks, mantas and whales...surfing amazing breaks with only a few people in the line up...  Plus this city is growing quite fast, and with it comes more diversity in food and culture, which I'm enjoying. It's also good to remember that nowhere has everything you're looking for."

Unfortunately there are also a number of products that they won't sell to Australian customers (I believe it's because the manufacturers won't let them).  There is actually an Amazon.com.au, but they don't currently sell physical goods aside from Kindle devices.   Strange trading hours here in QLD, although that's slowly changing.    You would have hated it 25 years (or thereabouts) ago :)  Shops used to only be open after 5 or so one day a week (Thursday nights) and were all closed on Sundays.

IWantOut,3abm15,telgerot,13,Fri Jun 19 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"American living in L'viv, Ukraine.  (2 years here, another 2 years in Odessa)  Pros   Everything is ridiculously cheap.  50 U.S. cents for a beer, meals can be around $2-3 in a decent restaurant.  Basically everything except imported goods is extremely affordable. Good weather.  All four seasons, doesn't get too hot in the summer nor too cold in the winter.  Plenty of seasonal activities (skiing/hiking/biking) and the mountains are next door. Interesting history.  Many of the buildings in the center of this town are 3x older than my country.  I really love classical architecture and hate modern construction so for me it's a real treat to own an apartment which is over 100 years old in the center of a historic district (sort of a life-long dream of mine) Beautiful people.  No obesity epidemic, people generally look really good, men and women alike.  It's hard to put into words but I find it rather inspiring to be surrounded by people who look better than I do (and depressing when everyone around you is a fat slob).  I'm not saying that there aren't land whales around here, but there's 100x fewer of them than back where I lived.   Proximity to other places - Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova - all a bus ride away.  Cheap flights to the Baltics and Georgia as well - airplane tickets in the states are ridiculously expensive in comparison.     Cons   Difficulty to fit in (actually just made a post about this topic here a few days ago).  Even if you know the language(s), I think it can be hard to find one's place here in L'viv.  A lot of people don't understand why a foreigner would come and voluntarily live here when many people are trying to get out, especially due to the economic/political situation.  I couldn't imagine how hard it would be if you don't know/speak the language here. Soviet bureaucratic bullshit/corruption - Although L'viv desperately tries NOT to associate with Russia/the former Soviet Union, it still has a lot of the same mentalities that persisted in that region for the last 50 years.  Dealing with any government department is a huge pain in the ass.  Bribes are common, the judicial system is pretty much a joke. Strange western tourists.  Most tourists here are from Ukraine/surrounding countries, and they are fine.  However, there are a lot of missionaries, sexpats, and general losers who come here to try to take advantage of people's ignorance and the economic leverage that they have in their home country (see pro points 1 and 4 above).  It's amazing how many foreign con artists there are around here.   That's the short list.  Overall, I think it's totally worth it.  I've settled down here and now I'm raising a family, so obviously I'm pretty invested in the place!  EDIT:  Words, punctuation."

IWantOut,3abm15,newyorkeric,2,Fri Jun 19 13:16:14 2015 UTC,"No you're absolutely right, all these things are problems, I just wouldn't really count them as the ""major"" ones that affect my attitude about living here.  Maybe it sounds really callous, but I'm more concerned about the day-to-day bureaucratic nonsense I experience than the grander political stuff that is happening.  Regarding your specific points:   The war feels very, very far away in L'viv.  Bear in mind that geographically speaking, L'viv is closer to Berlin than it is to the warzone in the East. The economic situation is shit, but if you are paid in dollars/euros (like I am), it's actually just making everything cheaper.  I'd rather it not be that way, because I think that if the economy continues into the toilet then there are going to be riots, but right now it hasn't hurt me yet. General political unrest is pretty standard here, definitely.  I have very little faith in governments anyway though, so I don't put a lot of weight on this point.  Needless to say - if you are a civic minded person who demands a transparent government, Ukraine is not to place to be!   But yeah, to each their own.  Another good example - cars.  If you like cars, Ukraine is not the best place for you - the roads are bad, break-ins are common, they are expensive (because of taxes) and the traffic cops live to give you hell.  Fortunately, I don't own a car.  :)"

IWantOut,3abm15,newyorkeric,2,Fri Jun 19 07:49:37 2015 UTC,Did you know Ukrainian or Russian before moving there?
IWantOut,3abm15,telgerot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:22:53 2015 UTC,"I knew a fair amount of Russian before arriving (I'd say I was a solid B1 level, sort of lower-intermediate).  Now I'm probably just in the C1 range, as it is the language I speak with my wife and her family in.  I didn't know any Ukrainian until I moved to L'viv two years ago, now I'm at a B1 level in it as well.  (This is all based on my own judgement of course - I haven't taken an official exam for either language.)"
IWantOut,3abm15,newyorkeric,2,Fri Jun 19 12:38:11 2015 UTC,"That's great progress. Russian isn't easy.  Did you find that people treated you much differently once you learned some Ukrainian, or do they just expect foreigners to learn Russian over Ukrainian?"
IWantOut,3abm15,telgerot,2,Fri Jun 19 12:44:29 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I could probably write a book about this topic actually.  :)  So people's first impression when you learn some Ukrainian is generally very positive - L'vivians especially take pride in their language and are usually shocked that someone would take the time to learn it.  However, if you are going to learn Ukrainian/Russian, they will definitely expect you to learn Ukrainian here because ""everyone speaks Ukrainian in L'viv!""1  But once I got the pleasantries down, I ran into the common problem of people wanting to practice their English, while not quite having the patience for my slow Ukrainian.  Most people under the age of 35 here studied/study English in school, and realize how important it is for their economic well being to be fluent in it.  English lessons are expensive and people will use whatever opportunity they can to improve their skills.  Couple that with people's general lack of experience with foreigners learning their language2, and it can be a frustrating experience.  There's also the unspoken skepticism of why a foreigner would even need to learn Ukrainian, ESPECIALLY if you speak English.  I mentioned above that people don't usually understand why a foreigner would want to live here, so you are perceived as a perpetual tourist.  Since you already speak English, and everyone wants to speak to you in English, why would you need to learn Ukrainian, right?  Except none of the government offices, events, movies, concerts, plays, operas, or basically anything directed to the public are in English, so you will be forever alone in your English speaking bubble if you actually let Ukrainians convince you that you don't need to learn Ukrainian.  :)  Also, there is a completely different situation if you are Russian/Ukrainian, speak Russian but don't understand/speak Ukrainian.  Many L'vivians will have a much more negative attitude if you are from the east but don't understand their language - you don't get the free pass that westerners do.  Hope that sums that up.  1 Actually this isn't true, 30% of the city speaks Russian as a native language, most people understand it (although fewer can speak it well) and last year as a sign of solidarity the whole city switched to Russian for a day.  2 What I mean here - I grew up in a cosmopolitan city where we had lots of people who were learning English and didn't speak it ""well"" - I was exposed to a ton of accents, and also raised to help people try to integrate into the culture.  I participated in cultural exchange groups in university, served with foreign nationals in the Army, etc.  Ukrainians don't have that experience in Ukrainian, so they don't have the ear for accents or the patience that might be ingrained in Westerners to be more accommodating to people who are trying to learn their language.  Hope that makes sense."

Pros   Salaries are great It's cheap to travel abroad pretty much anywhere Life here is really relaxed and easy-going Work-life balance is important to people, you are encouraged to take out all your holidays and not work overtime unless asked to Strong unionization means good job security Service people are generally very polite Strong gender equality (going both ways). Dads get to take parental leave with their kids, while women are not talked down to in the workplace or given lesser job opportunities. I personally love the lack of really warm summers   Cons   Food selection here sucks. There is a severe lack of imported goods in regular stores so if you want any sort of import selection you need to research where it's sold or order it from abroad. The winters are very dark. I love cold, but not seeing any daylight (never mind sun!) for weeks in winter can really get to you No dual citizenship unless you are born into both Norwegian and foreign one (and even then there are tons of exceptions and a real chance to lose the Norwegian citizenship if you don't live in Norway as a child). It is hard to make friends unless you are a social butterfly. Norwegians also socialize in very different ways than most people are used to, so it can feel like you are failing to make good impression on people even though you are.   Neutral   Draconian alcohol laws. I personally drink only very rarely so it doesn't really effect me, but alcohol sales are very restricted."

IWantOut,3abm15,AsianSteleotype,2,Fri Jun 19 08:13:29 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't need a citizenship in order to live somewhere. :) Getting a residence card is pretty straight forward as an EU citizen as long as you find a full time job. Citizenship is great if you plan to stay permanently, though. As a general rule, you will have to give up all other citizenships (and provide proof that you have done that) if you wish to get a Norwegian one. The only exception is if you can prove that your other countries refused to release you."
IWantOut,3abm15,giraver,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:16:56 2015 UTC,So there's no way of staying permanently without having to give up one of my citizenships? Or is it possible to switch one instead of giving up both?
IWantOut,3abm15,davidjohnmeyer,2,Fri Jun 19 06:08:07 2015 UTC,"If you wanted a Norwegian citizenship you would have to give up all your other citizenships, not just one. It's not a trade of any sort. Norway does not allow multiple citizenships unless you can prove that your other countries refused to release you.  It is possible to stay pretty much permanently on just a simple residence permission though. There are permanent residence permissions that you can obtain after 5 years of working in Norway at a full-time job. The downside of a permanent residence status is that you lose it if you leave the country for a certain amount of time (it's only really ""permanent"" as long as you are in Norway long-term). You also cannot vote in the general elections or join the army."

IWantOut,3abm15,overk4ll,3,Fri Jun 19 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"US -> Panama  Pros   Essentially zero unemployment. Very international. The US dollar is the official currency. Easier to get foreign goods than in many other countries. Good infrastructure. A lot of people speak English (though not as many as they tell you before you arrive). Freedom. (This is an odd one, because people consider the US to be free, but in some senses, the developing world is more free because there's less nanny-state regulation. If you want to open a hot dog stand, you build it, stick it on the corner and hang out your shingle. Nobody's going to ask you for a permit or come inspect your stuff. Of course, that's a double-edged sword.) Incredibly varied geography and climate. The city, mountains, beach, rainforest and islands are all within about a 90 minute radius. It's a 2.5 hour flight to Miami and there are daily non-stops to about a dozen other cities in North America.   Cons   Traffic. Litter/recycling/sewage/air pollution. (They're about 40 years behind in this regard.) Lack of highly skilled people. (If you need a job done right, you have to hire the best person in the country in order to get what would be considered average quality work in the more developed world, and it's often difficult to find that person.) Bureaucracy. (Seems to be a common theme in this thread. Although a lot of stuff doesn't require government involvement, if what you're doing does, expect it to take a long time.) The lack of a highly functional judicial system can make business difficult, because there's no strong disincentive for acting in bad faith. Caveat emptor.   As a final note, the weather is both a pro and a con. It's always hot and humid. When it's winter in northern climates, that's a big plus, but it's not always comfortable."

You can get a beer, walk outside and drink it on the sidewalk. So civilised also, for any pint of beer on the menu, you can order a half and you pay half price for half the beer. Sounds like a stupid thing, but I really like this museums, shows, history comparatively cheap interweb good chocolate   Cons   It is bloody expensive to live in the city, but great if you can schools are better back home no real winter no real outdoors. You're always close to something north american sports start between midnight and 3am energy is expensive (electricity, gas) little washer/dryer combo units in the kitchen I thought movies in the theatre were expensive back home... dear God are they nuts here cold popcorn at the theatre too.

IWantOut,3abm15,ecb29,9,Sat Jun 20 11:19:22 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen a Scandinavian one yet.  US -> Denmark  Cons    High sales tax on top of already expensive stuff As a temporary resident, I don't get access to most of the social welfare that my taxes pay for.  There is no low-end, cheap food. Finding an entre for less than 100kr ($15 USD) is a good deal.  The cuisine is kind of boring. Not bad, just a bit uninteresting.  Imports/distribution is lacking, i.e. there are a lot of things (food or otherwise) that you just can't get here.  People have a reputation for being surface-level friendly but unwilling to become friends in the long term.    Pros  Aside from all of the usual Nordic circlejerk of ""OMG free healthcare and education! Paternity/Maternity leave for a year! 5 weeks vacation!""   The political system works, and represents the people.  Free entertainment . There is always something going on, like free festivals and street parties.  Lax attitude towards alcohol, with some of the best breweries in the world here. So many open spaces where people hang out and relax. Parks, waterfronts, beaches, hiking/biking trails.  Great proximity to the rest of Europe.   Controversial opinion- I love the weather. I moved from Southern California where there are only two seasons- nice, from Dec to May, and annoyingly hot, from June to Nov. Ask anyone from SoCal and they'll tell you they love when it rains and when it's cloudy.

I generally agree, but will add a few (I'm kind of a more negative person):  Cons   Grocery stores are just awful affairs, especially the discount ones which are the only place you can get staples for non-lunatic prices Somewhat related to above, can't buy American food items for any price anywhere.  Most of the online EU American food importers only serve larger EU countries and won't even ship to Denmark. Lack of nature/wilderness/wildlife, and no mountains Language is ridiculous to pronounce and ugly, and since everyone speaks English it makes it harder to learn and ever truly integrate Haircut costs $80 minimum (for a woman's basic cut), other random services insanely overpriced due to union monopolies Anti-immigration xenophobia seething under the surface of everything, as the election yesterday showed.  I'm constantly afraid of new bullshit anti-immigrant legislation being passed that is illegal under EU law.  It takes a while before the country can be sued and the legislation removed (e.g. child benefits were cancelled for all non-Danish citizens for a period before 2013). Housing situation is completely impossible with respect to rentals, and non-citizens need a state ministry to sign off to be able to purchase any property.  Some years have literally no summer, like this one so far. Weather is generally boring and miserable (I'm not from SoCal but I'm sure SoCal cold rain happiness delirium wears off eventually) Insane dark in winter   Pros:   Lots of daylight hours in summer Not as bad re: nature and flatness as say...the Netherlands.  Well it's something...and where there is nature, it's usually publicly accessible Generally relaxing, low-stress atmosphere Some excellent career opportunities exist - it's a good place to work Earning a salary here, you'll feel like a tycoon when you go pretty much anywhere else on Earth Very kid-friendly and great place to raise children, if you're into that sort of thing"

However at my German office that I am in contact with for 90% of the day there is so much unnecessary stress...the bosses seem to be under a huge amount of stress and are always looking to blame somebody except for themselves..also there seems to be some divide between the older generation and the younger one..I work in IT and many times the older generation has no idea what they are talking about but the younger guys are all too afraid to do something about it(this is just my anecdotal evidence I'm sure its different at other companies)  That being said something I really liked about Germany was the infrastructure they had there...everything seemed so fresh and new compared to the Czech Republic...If you have ever driven on a Czech Highway you would know what I""m talking about(they are terrible) I also liked how people seemed to dress up and present themselves nicely...in Czech Republic its common to go to work in your shittiest t-shirt and jeans.  Overall, I loved living in both places but I just prefer where I am now a little bit more"
IWantOut,3abm15,duffmanhb,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:27:14 2015 UTC,I'm an american in Germany. Been here for more than four years.
IWantOut,3abm15,limasxgoesto0,3,Fri Jun 19 01:55:27 2015 UTC,Where in Germany?  Could you list your pros and cons?  I'm interested in Berlin but I'm also interested in Germany in general
IWantOut,3abm15,Schadenfreuder,7,Fri Jun 19 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"I live in Berlin.  Pros  Healthcare. Seriously, not having to worry about a medical bill ruining your life is huge.   People seem to be a bit more fitness oriented in general. Lots of walking. The city is always busy.  Long vacations. I get 24 paid vacation days per year plus unlimited sick days (of doctors notes required).  I make way less money here even with my husband and yet we live comfortably in a two bedroom apartment with a balcony.  The public transit system is awesome when there isn't a strike going on...  Berlin is very green. Lots of parks, gardens etc.  The city is random as hell. Oh look bar, playground, casino, cow farm, sbahn station. Wat.  Food is cheap in Berlin  Our rent including all utilities is about 900€ a month. Beyond that we have our cellphones (50€ per month) internet (38€) and public transit (120€ for both of us, unlimited). That is a fairly low cost of living.  Cons  Things can be expensive here.   Rent laws and standards are weird to Americans. You have to cold rent (per square meter) and that is just what you pay for the space. Then you add on the warm rent which is additional costs like utilities, garbage collection, building upkeep etc. While cold rent is regulated by the government warm rent isn't. The landlord most provide an itemized list of what you are being charged and you can end up owing more than what you paid per month. Last year our end balance was over 970€ due to rising electricity prices. I almost fainted. This year it is more like 300€. The warm rent is an estimation.  Dealing with government. Be ready to start a process in one building and then have to head across town to finish it.  Stores closing by 8 or 9 and not being open sometimes for four days over holidays. Lord help you if you forget to buy TP before easter or Christmas.  I find the attitude many Germans have of ""you must always give the appearance of having your shit together at all times."" very off putting. I would describe a lot of the older generation as waspy and very quick to tell other people what to do. Of course I have met many that are not like this...but the bad tends to stick out more than the good in this area.  German over the counter meds are expensive as hell and generally taste horrible. Which deters people from abusing a lot of meds. 7 pills of decongestant can cost about 12€.  On the same note of medications. I do like that the doctors check up on me more often. In many cases you need to see your doctor every three months if you take an ongoing RX to get a refill. Though, it is annoying for those ones that you can be approved for for an entire year but you still need to go every three months just to pick up the RX there is no calling it in to the pharmacy.  Church tax. If you register as Catholic or Protestant be ready to pay 10% of your income in taxes to the government. Good luck trying to tell them you no longer to to church.  The somewhat denial of race issues. There are families of Turkish background that have been here since the 1950s and are citizens but don't get treated very well. I would liken it to how many black or Hispanic people can be treated in the USA. It is a complex issue and the biggest part is that so many people are freaked out about german history that the topic is not addressed as it should be."
IWantOut,3abm15,thatsboxy,5,Fri Jun 19 16:21:02 2015 UTC,"Long vacations. I get 24 paid vacation days per year plus unlimited sick days (of doctors notes required).   24 is pretty much the legal minimum (without reading the laws again I think it's 4 weeks, and they count Saturday as a working day). What job do you work in? If it's a startup, or a lower-end job, then something close to 24 is normal. For any higher level job 30 days is very common.   Church tax. If you register as Catholic or Protestant be ready to pay 10% of your income in taxes to the government. Good luck trying to tell them you no longer to to church.   If I understand correctly, you can register with the Standesamt (registrar's office) and declare that you no longer identify with that faith, i.e. resign from it. (""Kirchenaustritt""). Costs a small fee, then you send the paperwork to your Einwohnermeldeamt and should no longer have to pay the taxes. I am an atheist, so not sure on the exact procedure, and of course you'd have to be okay with that approach before your various deities, but it shouldn't be difficult.

If you bring up immigration issues here, you are automatically labeled a Nazi no matter how calm and rational you try to discuss the subject. It's an almost guaranteed career death sentence for a politician, so nobody touches it."
IWantOut,3adk3k,CapitalOneBanksy,2,Fri Jun 19 06:21:24 2015 UTC,"'Less popular' means different things.  Every major capital in the world, from Tokyo to Lima to Cairo, will have at least a relatively large expat community.  The diplomatic community is getting larger with greater cultural, intelligence and aid programs, globalisation means the finance/legal/business communities are present in basically every country on earth except North Korea and Cuba, and all of those people, their spouses and children mean western hospitals, doctors, schools, chefs, teachers and so on follow them.   The only capitals/major cities with few expats are in completely undeveloped countries, mostly in Africa, and in some central Asian countries, although many of them still have the oil business which has a lot of westerners.    So the people who move to places without many expats will be those who move to rural areas.  Most of these people will be following spouses (since other well-paid, professional immigrants/expats tend to cluster around cities), and will experience far greater culture shock.    It is the location, far more than the country, that creates the feeling of isolation.  You could easily feel more lost in rural Germany than in Tokyo, despite Japan being much more culturally foreign, because the latter has a massive expat community while the former does not."

If you can, well, ""hack"" it in one of these majors, by all means go ahead. Over here we've got the standardized testing system (Common Core, or PARCC as it's called in my state) that has basically declared history irrelevant to the job market (and therefore worthless to teach). It's being quickly phased out in favor of programming and engineering.  Teaching pays shit, too. Wages have remained pretty much static over the past 25 years, while the cost of living has gone way up. When my mother was a teacher in 1990, her salary was $30,000. Today the average teaching salary is... $30,000. That's a 0% increase in overall wages, combined with a reduction of benefits overall and abysmal job security.  If you don't mind living hand to mouth, well, go ahead and take the risk. If you want to actually be able to live in a place that has working indoor plumbing and isn't a Section 8 roach motel, don't become a teacher. Do math. Do programming. Do plumbing. Anything but education and the arts."
IWantOut,3aepao,JMorand,2,Sat Jun 20 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"I'm double-posting, but I think you wouldn't be notified if I simply edited...  My suggestion to you is to check the 'Labor Shortage List' of some countries you might like to live in.  New Zealand's  Sweden's shortage list  Australia's  Quebec's  And there are many others. Take a look on what they need. Those jobs will be both well paying (because they have low supply of workers) and make your path to emigration easier.  Also, take a look on what I've replied to the question ""How did you become interested in engineering? What are your favorite aspects of engineering?""""   I'll answer both together.  Well, there are a multitude of reasons of why engineering, and why Mechanical Engineering.  First of all, my personal reasons:  For some reason, my father, my grandfather and my great-grandfather (I mean, my paternal line) are all engineers. This might have played a role, in terms of my home   environment, genetically induced personality, role models, or it's just a coincidence, I don't know.  Other than that, I think that to me, it was the natural course in which childhood games and curiosity grew, I've always liked Lego; building silly things with strings and tape; taking things apart; I've always loved airplanes, submarines, cars, motorcycles, trains, trucks, industries, and everything else, I watched lots of discovery channel, I was fascinated with all that. I think in part this is what engineering is about, it's a big mind game for grown ups.  But I think there are many other reasons behind, some of them more objective than that:  -Personal Satisfaction:  In my opinion, engineering and science are the greatest tools humanity have in order to minimize suffering and bring prosperity. If you look around you, there is so much in your life that is an achievement of these two fields. I'll focus specifically on Mechanical Engineering, but there are numerous other fields: Heating and refrigeration, almost all types of power generation besides photo-voltaic, basically all manufacturing, transportation systems, pumps, engines, metallic structures, many aspects of robotics, etc. So engineering is something that you do with the certainty that you are generating wealth and benefits to the community and improving the world.  On this, I'll quote President Hoover: ""It [engineering] is a great profession. There is the fascination of watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes to men. Then it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life. That is the engineer's high privilege.""  -Personal gains:   Engineering is a well paid, in-demand profession.   -Flexibility, transferability and many options ahead:  Well, I can say without a shadow of doubt that engineering is the most flexible course ou can make, specially if you choose one of the most wide ones such as Mechanical, Electrical or Chemical.  If you want to work as an mechanical engineer, as it's the example I'm more familiar with, you could choose from: Solid Mechanics; Materials Engineering; Thermodynamics and Thermosciences; Combustion Engines; Fuid Mechanics, Mechanisms; Vibrations; Control Engineering; Mechatrionics; Energy; Structural Analysis; Dynamics; Metrology and Instrumentation; Engineering Design; Computar models for mechanical simulations; Acoustics; Reliability; Manufacturing; Corrosion; Safety, etc. each of these sub-branching into many more subjects. And even then, you could do a masters and choose to work on interface fields, such as: Bio-engineering; Nanotechnology, IT, among others;  You can also work for several industries: Aerospace; Naval; Automobilistic; Nuclear; Industrial; Petroleum; Textile; Geological; Also, teaching engineering at university is an option. The list is truly enormous so I'll stop here.  And if you don't want to work as an engineer after you finish, you also have a ton of options: Finance, Logistics, Operations Management, Patent Law and Intellectual Property, Technical Sales, Human Resources, and several other administrative roles.  Bottom line is, if you are in high school, you probably don't have it all figured out, and if you have, it will probably all change as you grow up. So it's time to keep as many doors open as you can, while still making progress. Engineering is ideal for that. Later if you are tired being a mechanical engineer, go be a teacher, work at the financial market, be a bio engineer, work with law, the world is yours to take.  Engineering gives you a great perspective on analytic, logical and critical thinking, problem solving, fast learning, technological aptitude, among other qualities.  -Being prepared for the future: The world is changing blazing fast. And I thing engineers are the ones better prepared to deal with the technological revolution we are going though, since we are leading it. The last thing humanity needs to invent is a machine that substitutes engineers and scientists, so I guess engineering jobs are safer than others.   I can expand on this in a further post, because I think it's a very important subject for us that want to begin at a profession at this point in time, but it would make this post extremely long.  -Immigration privileges:  Engineers are in many country's ""occupations in demand"" lists. This gives huge benefits for immigration. Some of the countries that favour immigration of mechanical engineers are:  Sweden, Germany, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, UK. Some of them are easier, some of the harder. But you will be in a HUGE advantage over someone with a degree in, let's say, liberal arts, business and even medicine (this one because it's strictly regulated). It's definitely the best profession if you want to move around the globe. Or at least to have this option open in any case.  -I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting something...:   If I remember I'll send another reply with it.

Studying engineering might be stressful. The advice I have is: have a hobby that relaxes you; Sleep 8 hours per night, seriously, not sleeping well will impair your cognition (although you may need to pull some allnighters); Do not skip classes, seriously; Keep hand written annotations of all the classes; Ask questions on class; Go to tutorials and office hours, this will improve your performance and will make the teachers notice you as an interested student.  Besides that, in engineering you will most of the time study science and, of course, engineering, but so will every other engineer. Try to improve other cultural aspects of yourself, for example, learn a language, take an interest for history, geography, economics, traveling, reading, you name it. This will be a great advantage over the others.  And take care of your health, I myself have gained lots of weight since I started the course, now I'm trying to lose it. Exercising will keep your mind active, your stress low and your health good, it will impact your studies in a positive way. Also don't refrain to seek psychological help if you ever need, it's perfectly normal.    Keep your mind and ears open, keep yourself updated with the technology world, read sites like extremetech, iee spectrum, popular science, scientific american, etc.  Also, you don't need to be a genius at maths. It's one of the many tools you will be using as an Engineers. It's an important one. You can't hate it either, or be completely oblivious to it. But in the end, you will be an engineer, not a mathematician. So don't worry if you are not the maths genius in your class, (but if you are, even better).   I hope I've helped you at least a little. If you have more questions you can PM me any time. :)"

It is really difficult to emigrate to the UK as an American citizen for an extended period without getting married, going to school (which is expensive) or similar routes.  Citizenship would get you in, allow you to access the health care system, make you eligible for benefits, etc.  London is expensive, but not as expensive as you might think.  For example, my rent was about $700 (Zone 3- Green Lanes), and if you are earning in pounds, the prices are not as intimidating.  Incidentally, a lot of Americans live in that area.

They look at Gumtree.com and other online places for rural work. When they're there, it is so popular you can sometimes have 100-150 travelers working in some places.

Then it's time to spend that money and travel, and have a good time. Then back in the work scene when they need it.   On their second year there's less requirements, so you can stay in your favorite city and get cafe work, etc (similar wages).

IWantOut,3a9fu6,siqniz,2,Thu Jun 18 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"I expect Polish salaries are pretty far below US in software development, do you have a general ballpark on that?"
IWantOut,3a9fu6,siqniz,7,Thu Jun 18 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're far below US salaries. If you're looking to get rich then this probably is not the position for you. If you're looking for a much better lifestyle and the ability to live very comfortably (financially) in Poland, then you are welcome to apply.  A few facts:   Cost of living is very low here. Beer on average costs USD$1.00 (at the store) and you can buy all your groceries for one month for two people for USD$100. You can budget this to even less. It depends on your eating habits. Polish labor laws requires that employees are given at least 20 days off a year, not including national or company holidays. This is bumped to 26 if you have least 10 years experience in your field. The time spent obtaining your professional degree also counts towards your experience.  if you work even 5 minutes overtime, labor law entitles you to 5 minutes off the next day or you can receive the overtime paid 150% of your normal pay. It's your choice. if you work on a Sunday or a holiday for even 5 minutes, you are entitled to 150% pay for a full day and one full day off work the following week. 6 months of paid maternity leave. 2 weeks of paid paternity leave. Mothers can extend their leave up to one year and are entitled to 80% pay. Parental leave can be shared or divided between both parents.    I gave up over half of my US salary to come here and there is no way I would ever go back ;) It's all about the lifestyle now, not the money. PM me if you want salary specific info."

Extract of refugee definition from a western country:  If you are a convention refugee, this means you have a good reason to believe you are in danger, and that the authorities in your country will not or cannot protect you. You may fear that you will be harmed because of your race, religion, political opinion, nationality, gender or sexual orientation.  Persons in need of protection are people who, if returned to their home country or country where they normally live, would face:   a danger of torture, a risk to their life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.   To prove that you are a person at risk if returned to your country, you must show that all of the following apply:   you are not able to get state protection from your country, the risk is specific towards you or your family, you face the risk in every part of your country, the risk is not the result of punishment for a crime you committed, unless the punishment violates international standards,  and the risk is not because of lack of adequate medical care."

Here are a few relevant links that might help: Danish embassies -  Asylum in Denmark  As long as you're under 18 years old, you'll be processed more quickly, and more care will be given  ... which means you don't have to wait until you turn 18 - as long as you can get access to a phone, and let the people at the embassy guide you.

Writing what is essentially a confession on the internet is probably a bad idea if you live some place where these things can get you killed. A cursory internet search tells me that you are one Noor O Zeki https://twitter.com/noorozeki. Now I know you live in Baghdad. I know you participated in IYLEP. I found your youtube videos. From one of those videos I now know that you own a macbook. I also know that you've visited Chicago. I found your instagram. You take a lot of pictures. Pictures tend to capture geographical features in the background, which can often identify the exact location. I got all of this in under 5 min. If I was a government with more resources and interest, I could probably find you. I dont mean to scare you here, but I think it would pay for you to be a bit more paranoid when posting things on the internet.    All I can really say is when posting things like this, use throw away accounts. Browse in incognito mode. Try and obscure your computer as much as possible.

Try to make the request in person first. If that is completely 100% impossible, call them from a payphone that is not under any type of video surveillance.  If you absolutely must e-mail them then use a web browser like Tor. I believe this website is blocked in your country but there are other download links available to you if you search for it. Using this web browser, create a fake e-mail address using FAKE information, and then e-mail them. Do it all from Tor. Whenever accessing this inbox, always always always use Tor.

IWantOut,3a68as,Smartare,9,Wed Jun 17 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience near your age, and it's been a decade since making my big decisions.  Although I was nowhere near danger, I came out as an atheist in a community where losing your religion is taboo as well.  I then moved to Boston in America, quickly found the love of my life, and will be finishing graduate school soon with a range of future prospects.  Again, I don't know if our situations are comparable in terms of danger or desperation.  But I too was scared to make an unpredictable change, yet I have not once regretted taking a jump into the dark.  The world is a big place, and areas where most people report happiness seem to actually be happy.  You are the captain of your life.  Create a fundamental goal.  Here are some possible roads:   Stay at home and recreate yourself to match your family's wishes and your environment. Simply wait and see what happens.  You may change in ways you cannot now imagine. Stay at home and learn to do what you want in secret. Stay at home and become an active advocate for change, or a martyr. Move somewhere that shares your values, and create a new life there.   Whatever your goal is, consider with some care what that goal will take:   Think through how you will eventually cope with losing what you now think of as your identity.  Sometimes this happens naturally, and patience will do it for you. Find an anonymous web browser (like TOR) and find an online community that shares your values.  You may also find local places to meet this way. If you want to advocate for atheists or gay rights, plan what your message will be, and what consequences you are willing to accept.  Plan what you will do, where, with whom, how, and why. Acquire an education or profession first.  These things are extremely powerful, but can be hard to find depending on your situation.  The internet is full of ways to learn practical skills that can be used anywhere, especially skills with computers and mathematics, or trade skills like becoming an electrician or plumber. Acquire these things in part, such that you are confident that you could live for two years in a new country.  By that time, you will almost certainly have learned something new about your life prospects. If you are danger, find a group that will help you leave immediately.   Again, whatever you do, it will be you who did it.  You are in charge.  But for what it's worth, it seems to me that it would be easier for you to broaden your options by first patiently and carefully planning to move to a safe and/or wealthy nation that speaks a language you are fluent in, and actively seek more options there."

IWantOut,3a68as,ApeOver,2,Thu Jun 18 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"This is a long shot, but entirely doable.  I live in Poland. We have two kinds of studies here. I'm not sure how tthey are called in english, so I will just use analogue words. One kind is the ""daytime"" studies. It's free, you can get a scholarship if you have good grades, but it's not enough to sustain you. But I know people who study difficult, STEM-related things, and work enough not to need money from anyone. It's hard, but entirely doable.  The secon kind of studies is the weekend kind. You have time to work all of the workdays, and you come to the university on weekends (usualy every other weekend, but you stay there for like 12 hours each day). In this kind of studying, you pay for your studies. Architecture is fairly expensive, but it's doable to work and study this way, without needing money from anyone.  I'm sure some universities offer architecture in English (you have to take a look at different art and technical unis in Poland).  The important thing is, the level of education here is good (not super good, but good) and it's fairly cheap, which makes this country very good for studying if your're from somewhere else. There are a LOT of foreign students, especially in medical schools in Poland. Most of them come from Asia. I imagine that since there are some many of them, it must not be that hard to figure out the formalities (I don't know what it's like with getting a visa or sth, but it must not be that hard if so many people get it).  Anyway, just food for thought. You can think about coming to Poland. The thing is, that to work, you will need to learn the infamous polish language. But believe me, there are many people who do it. Supposedly it's rather difficult, but still, I know people whose fluency in this language is stunning. Again, totally doable.  Think about it.  PS - I read in another post, that you are broke and cannot travel alone. What you want (to get out) is a big thing and will require long term planning and effort. I imagine there must be a way for you to start saving money. Like getting a part time job or sth. Also, once you are above 18 (or 21 or whatever) will you have the ability to travel alone? I'm guessing that yes. You are still very young. Start setting yourself up to get away, and in time, you will succeed."

IWantOut,3a9g5y,SeekTruthFromFacts,0,Thu Jun 18 09:15:51 2015 UTC,"On the specific point, you would need A-levels or equivalent, not IGCSE, to go to a university anywhere in Europe. University is for 18-year olds, not 16-year olds. That's why someone mentioned dual-education. You could use IGCSEs to get practical training, but if you're looking at 6As, my guess is that you don't want to spend the rest of your life in a factory assembly line or working as a hairdresser.  But I've got two wider points, that you should stop and think about, before your dreams get smashed by reality.   You are still a minor. The German authorities (especially in Bavaria) will probably be just as unhappy about you trying to live independently as the Malaysian ones would be. How would you feel about living in a children's home or being placed with a foster family? That's what might happen if you successful claim asylum in Germany. And it will be a great thing - everybody finds it tough in a new country and if the government tries to provide you with extra care and support as you adjust, you'll be really blessed. Asylum isn't offered to people who might be persecuted, it's offered to people who are being persecuted or certainly will be. You wrote in the first post that you are worried your family might find out and want to avoid that. I completely understand and respect the fact that you love your parent/parents/guardian? and don't want to hurt him/her. But an asylum claim is for people who are in danger, not discomfort - you are going to have to risk everything.   If you want an adventure and to build a new life, wait until you're a bit older. This isn't just my opinion: the whole basis of Western law and society is that most people aren't ready to make these kinds of big decisions until we're 18. It seems that you have a loving family but don't like your society. Well, think of your family as the oasis that will give you life in the desert. They are your island in the ocean full of sharks.  Of course, if you're really afraid that a mob is going to find out your sexual orientation and hurt you, then get out and get asylum. If you're really in danger, then that one word ""Asyl"" or ""Asylum"" should mean your life is safe anywhere in the EU. Not easy, not ideal, but safe."
