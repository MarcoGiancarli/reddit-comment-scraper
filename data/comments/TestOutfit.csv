Just as in your TV example, there are multiple programming options, it's also up to the provider to plan out those options in a logical, easy to access manner that reaches the largest audience.  I understand there will be scheduling issues, and some of us will be okay with them. Some of us will hate them. Most of us won't care one way or another. Hell, this is TEST, someone will always have an issue with something.

TestOutfit,3cu7g7,Daft_Punker,2,Fri Jul 10 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, i can see that, but the ""schedule"" isn't much of a schedule it seems. It's more of a ""pop ten steam events for ps2 a day, every day, every night"" kind of thing. It sort of kills the whole set schedule idea."
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,Yashoki,2,Sat Jul 11 00:04:56 2015 UTC,This guy!
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,IWetMyselfForYou,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:26 2015 UTC,"I think that's just a by-product of having more people who play PS2 and want to play PS2.   Dont forget that every few hours an alert pops that gives people a reason to group together and pull as many people together as they can. So the game inherently leads to people putting up steam events for an alert.  With ARMA we only have the two nights: Thursday and Saturday. ARMA requires people to organize ahead of time as it's not as pick-up-and-play as PS2 is. So while I agree with you, it's more than just ""The schedule means shit because pop pop pop events"".  The amount of people who come for PS2 per night very greatly, but on the scheduled nights. You can be sure there will be a dedicated group of people playing. There's nothing stopping anyone from scheduling impromptu events for ARMA."
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,Yashoki,2,Sat Jul 11 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, and that reinforces my previous statement. What was the point of our scheduling, if the scheduling doesn't mean much?   I'm not one to ever really complain. But we purposely changed our Arma scheduling around to accommodate PS2 scheduling, and give up Fridays for PS2. The impression that I got, was that PS2 was going to a set schedule, that all others could work around, and also leave open nights for those who want to schedule something randomly.  What it's turned into is having PS2 events running at almost all times. A lot of us don't like to step on toes, so we won't schedule things when other events are going on. Or we'd like to, but won't get a turnout because all time slots are filled with PS2.  I'm not trying to bash PS2. I still love the game. I still love playing with you guys. But the spammy nature of events has turned me off of it, which could be just me. And our scheduling agreement doesn't mean much when every night is PS2."
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,IWetMyselfForYou,2,Sat Jul 11 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"You know, I've wondered this too. My first reaction was to have dedicated days where we play PS2 and then play ARMA together (assuming people purchased the game, price drop plz), but the way you play PS2 is different than in ARMA. The progression requires you to play as often as you can to get those sweet certs and upgrades.  The reason I like the scheduling is because I know I can play ARMA on a server that isnt running on 19FPS (most nights) with a group that I know is pretty competent. And honestly the only reason I think PS2 HAD to be on friday was for Drunk OPs which really isn't a thing these days.   And there really isnt a reason things cant be scheduled on the same days, if the groups get big enough we can run multiple things on the same nights and people who want to play one or the other can choose, but I think since we dont have the biggest group right now, it's in a weird state. Maybe another meeting is in order?"
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,Ninbyo,3,Sat Jul 11 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think the main reason it irks me is because we agreed to move away from Fridays, which is the best day for me to play Arma. And I was looking forward to more event organization from PS2, as we've had in the past. It just feels more like AlertSide, with no official events or coordination."
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,IWetMyselfForYou,2,Sat Jul 11 22:50:37 2015 UTC,"Those alert events aren't really scheduled ahead of time, they're made in response to an alert popping in game. So if one pops during another scheduled event feel free to ignore it. The spamming needed to stop and people have already been warned not to spam alert events. You should at most see them once every few hours, but even I think that would be too much if it were consistently done for every alert.  It also looks like the PS2 events on Saturday and Thursday have been dropped off the official calendar.  Also, why the flying fuck is ARMA3 still $60 after nearly 2 years. At this point they're just hurting sales."
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,Ninbyo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:49:08 2015 UTC,"I know you guys were working on stopping the event spam. But with an event popped for every alert, it's sort of unavoidable.  Now, don't get me wrong, the amount of event pop ups doesn't bother me in the slightest. It's the fact that rather than having any sort of official PS2 event, it's turned into AlertSide. I guess it was inevitable. But I'd like to see some proper event organization, with different types of events, rather than just waiting on the next alert.  As for Arma pricing, I bet it'll be another year or two before they drop the price."

TestOutfit,3cu7g7,Cookie_Defender,2,Sat Jul 11 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"Doesn't recognize already installed addons. Doesn't Delta-Patch (as far as I'm aware). No Management options, you can download the whole repo or none of it. Being forced to use two separate programs for add-on management. The program has overall been buggy and ugly every time I've used it."
TestOutfit,3cu7g7,HoboYellow,2,Sat Jul 11 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. With some playing around with the program last night,   It does recognize addons that are already installed in the Arma 3 directory No Delta-Patch feature No management options. Although it is a nice feature, there is not a need for it because there are no optional addons in the ProjectAwesome repository No one is forcing you to permanently use SlickUpdater. You could use SlickUpdater to download the files and then create an addon group in Arma3Sync if you absolutely cannot stand to use something other than Arma3Sync. I've yet to encounter a bug in SlickUpdater and the program is not 'ugly'.   Honestly, SlickUpdater might not do everything that Arma3Sync does, but it makes the users experience very simplistic, which is very nice to have when many people can't seem to figure out Arma3Sync even with our guides that walk them through every step. SlickUpdater is a very simplistic program that does it's job quite well and I can't find any reason that dignifies not using the program exclusively to play with ProjectAwesome.  Massive Edit/Update: Corrected the information in my post after being in communication with one of the developers."

TestOutfit,3cszbs,Gargoame,3,Fri Jul 10 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"While I may or may not play, I have an idea for #4. Brace yourselves, it may be a tad complicated.  Combat turn order could be decided by something I'm going to call a ""Readiness Score"" (RS). The idea behind RS would be to mimic real-life combat initiative through assigning plus or minus values based on an individual character's particular ""readiness"" for a particular fight. The order of combat would start from the character with the highest RS and follow through decreasing numerical order. RS for all characters starts at 0 and is then modified by factors such as the ones listed below.   Did the character begin the combat encounter with a reasonable expectation that combat would occur? (+1 yes, -1 no, +2 planned ambush) Does the character have a weapon out and ready? (+1 yes, -1 no) Was the character able to observe overt aggressive action towards them or their friends, i.e. an enemy reaching for a gun? (+1 yes, -1 no) Was the character distracted by other events in the area? (-1 yes) Did the character successfully intimidate his/her opponents? (+1 yes) Is the character surrounded, flanked, or otherwise put at a numeric or strategic disadvantage at the start of combat? (-2 surround, -1 flanked) Does the character have cover or concealment from foes? (+2 cover, +1 concealment) Is the character in a position to surprise an enemy, ie possessing a concealed weapon which the enemy is not aware of? (+1 yes) Is the character in possession of a device or skill which would allow them to react faster in combat, ie laser or red dot sight? (+1 yes)   In theory, this system could easily get very descriptive. Downsides? Heavily reliant on player help and honesty, as there's a lot of numbers to take into account from a GM perspective.   For example, lets say two of the PC's notice a group of 5 armed raiders coming around a bend in the road directly in front of them. The PC's are moderately armed with a basic AR-15 and a pump action shotgun. Neither of their weapons have sophisticated sights (+0), but both PC's have their weapons drawn and loaded (+1 to each). The lead PC noticed the lead raider had a weapon out (+1 for combat expectation). The raider group hasn't yet noticed the PC's (+2 for element of surprise). The PC's are outnumbered 2 to 1 (-1 numeric disadvantage/hesitation). RS's for PC's 1 and 2 are 3 and 2 respectively.   The raiders have weapons ready (+1). They are unaware of the PC's (-2 ambush). They outnumber the PC's 2 to 1 (+1 numeric advantage). The back 2 raiders are still behind a building when the PC's engage (+2 cover). This brings the RS's for raiders 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to -2, -2, -2, 0, and 0.   The turn order would be as listed below:   PC 1 PC 2   3-4. Raiders 4-5  5-7. Raiders 1-3 (If alive)  I think it'd be an interesting system to try versus random die rolls. It would place a large emphasis on planning, terrain, and social interaction, which I believe would be good in a Fallout-ish game.  Thoughts?"
TestOutfit,3cszbs,Harq_Al-Ada,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:31:29 2015 UTC,I read the first few sentences and I love this mechanic.   Edit: I read the rest and I still like this idea.
TestOutfit,3cszbs,WhitePawn00,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:50:13 2015 UTC,"When I first started working on my rule set I wanted to make combat where players set all their actions together and then resolve in order. The idea was to make combat less meta-gamey (""Well the Orc is dead so I'll attack the wolf next."") but we tried it in Pathfinder and it didn't work too well. So that gives you my mindset.  With your ideas I'm thinking more of a decision tree rather than modifiers. For example, is the character aware or unaware is the first question on the left? That splits 2 parts of the decision tree. Then we subdivide more by other aspects like cover, distance, etc. On the right is the final result (unaware, not ready, not in cover) with a corresponding score that analogous to a bad d20 roll.  Then you can still specialize in being an initiative character (talent that adds +1 or goves you a minimum score).  I'd have to figure something out for what happens if you have the same score. I'm imagining same time shootouts like at the end of Enemy of the State."
TestOutfit,3cszbs,Harq_Al-Ada,2,Sat Jul 11 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"A decision tree might streamline things for establishing a base RS. You could always assign additional modifiers for encounter-specific advantages.   Initiative feats/talents I've thought of:   Paranoid: Character cannot be surprised by combat, but suffers penalties to social interactions as a result. Quick Draw: When armed with a one handed weapon, the character is always considered armed and ready for the purpose of RS. Weapon Expertise: Grants an automatic bonus to RS when using a specific type of weapon. Combat Trained: Grants a +1 tactical bonus to RS. Take a -1 to RS if in a situation alien to the style of combat trained. Night Adapted Eyesight: The character's eyes work better in the dark. Add +1 to RS during night time. Quick reflexes: The character has spent time developing their reaction time. Add +2 to RS when surprised by combat. Veteran: The character takes no RS penalty when outnumbered. Ghost: The character is adept at stealth and camouflage. Enemies become combat unaware of the character upon a successful stealth check at the beginning of combat. If already unaware, they take a further -1. Intimidating presence: The character may attempt a global intimidate check against all enemies' willpower at the start of combat. Any affected enemies take a -2 to RS."

TestOutfit,3cszbs,Junkle,2,Fri Jul 10 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm back.   I usually like to play RPG's for a combination of the story and exploring the ruleset.  Seeing how things work is always a fun time for me.  Combat can be a subset of that, but it doesn't have to be, it's just that it's a large focus of D&D. Keeping track of something a la sanity from Call of Cthulu might be interesting; call it radiation levels or something and have very few things get rid of it might give a good post-apocalypse/running out of supplies feeling.  I could probably think of other stuff with more time. I'd like to try out a medic of some sort.  Too many wizards and bowtillery characters recently. I have no idea if it would work, but I'd like to see people effectively betting for position in turn order, have point pools of some sort and then decide how much you're willing to pay for a good slot this turn.  Rolling for initiative tends to really help emphasize rocket tag systems. I wouldn't mind special powers, but I'd probably only want to use them sparingly.  I dunno, maybe not.  It would be interesting to see how post-apocalyptic society reacted to common use of what's effectively magic, be it psionics or what have you.  Really, anything is good."
TestOutfit,3cszbs,WhitePawn00,2,Fri Jul 10 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"1.I personally play them for the RP and the combat but much more for the RP side. However a large part of my enjoyment of RP comes from the game rules game mechanics and the lore.   2.the fact that there is a chance that after mutations of other beings, humans may not be the apex predator intrigues me. I also like the vault aspect of fallout which creates the concept of a lot of different communities in a tiny span of land. There's also the aspect that after 45 years of accelerated evolution (won't actually happen but it's a good hook) we could face the new humans.   3.In a post apocalyptic game is probably make a shy goodie two shoes with a lot of damage and a few well developed skills (talking in pathfinder terms).   4.Preparation and RP. Kind of like how fate does it. I mean individual quickness matters (RP) but if someone laid an ambush they get initiative. Or whoever draws first.   5.As long as the more supports it I'm all for it!"
TestOutfit,3cszbs,n0tl0c,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:46:56 2015 UTC,"Magic no; abilities from radiation yes, crafting/weapon/equipment modding yes, and strategic game play; weather also. As for enemies there are already a lot of hogs in Texas right now so a lot of radioactive hogs also there are some big cats still in Texas plenty of coyotes and dogs and if bears made a resurgence in Texas that would be good all; mutated of course.  Also just thought of mutated flocks of birds that would be hard to deal with so you/party would probably have to run or hide from them  (Same as RJ sandbox it w/ role playing)"
TestOutfit,3cszbs,IrishBandit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"1.A mix of everything usually makes the best games.  2.Instead of just blasted desert, maybe some different climactic changes? Like glowing snow  3.I like to synergize with the rest of the group in both personality and gameplay.  4.It would entirely rely on how fast-paced you wanted the combat to be. If you wanted to try something more frantic you could make us all do our action simultaneously or something.  5.I don't think magic powers fits in a post-nuclear setting, even if you explain it away."
TestOutfit,3cszbs,acustic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:26:27 2015 UTC,"I definitely like to shoot shit, or more like slaughter shit. In fact, I think a great idea would be if the game would somehow include elements of hack and slash, very high number of enemies, very strong weaponry that does AOE damage.   I'd like the character to be a deranged psychopath that lives in his own little fantasy world where he sees what he wants to see and hears what he wants to hear to justify slaughter, maybe he has some sort of radiation sickness causing his mental issues and he works his way throughout the game to obtain a cure that will actually heal him at which point he'll realize all he's done and cap himself only to resurrect as a mindless mutant that would now be able to kill even more, like essential NPCs and whatnot.  I have no idea what #4 means so I'll ignore it. It sounds like something TBS related thing in which case you lost me. I'm okay with him having mild powers like talk to animals, or, imagine he can talk to animals? You don't know, you're not crazy like him."

Well, first of all, this all takes place about 500 years in the future. Mankind has fled Earth because of an environmental disaster and colonized a star system with tons of moons and planets that were terraformed.  The two people in the hologram are brother and sister, they're part of the main cast of the show and movie. The girl was taken by the government and experimented on. He came to rescue her. Right after that is the point where the show picks up. The operative (guy with the sword) is ordered by the government to find her before the secrets she might know are made public.  He's basically a badass government secret agent. He's actually the villain of the movie. The movie follows the crew of the Serenity as they try to keep ahead of him and deal with one of the secrets that the government is trying to hide. They're basically space cowboys on the run from the law."

TestOutfit,3bxs8y,wildcatmatt360,2,Fri Jul 3 01:07:43 2015 UTC,"Some slight corrections: This is the old google calendar that I was using to plan our recurring Planetside events with. We're expanding it to allow for other groups to plan and add their regular events or anything that is pre-planned.   NOTE: This is not replacing Steam calendars.   Steam calendars are still available for their respective groups; however, having a single calendar all games can organize by makes it easier for group leaders and/or event organizers. Steam calendars will still be primary for their respected games and used for popup events such as an alert in Planetside or a play test for ARMA, this is because they are unplanned/random events and really only apply to people who are  available to play right then.  You can add the address  79tde5jcv5dumoopi9c2j7ejvs@group.calendar.google.com   to your google calendar under the ""Add a friends calendar"" option; people with access (which will be limited temporarily) can add items directly to the calendar. If you want to or are currently organizing events for one or more groups within TEST let me know and I will add your google account. (This can of course be done privately via reddit mail.)  Eventually I want to link the calendar to our twitter account  HOWEVER  The person/people with access to the outfit twitter account and/or email address (yahoo.com) have not stepped forward.

TestOutfit,3bl112,Puckered_anus_mouth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:47:09 2015 UTC,"The two starting classes are a Medic (Aura) and a Fire support class (Skyhammer).  You will always have these 2.    The main class archtypes are:   Medic - Heals/Revives Fire Support - Has some kind of ability to hit things from a distance.  (Air strikes, arty, orbital laser, etc) Assault - Kills things really well.  Chainguns and Grenades Engineer - Objective monkeys.  Does all objectives faster than other classes.   The different mercs are a combination of long/short range and an above archtype.  For example, Sparks is a long range medic where Aura is a short range medic.    The other 3 free mercs are on rotation.  You will always have an Engineer (Proxy or Bushwhacker) on that free rotation.  This week is Proxy.  Also this week is Nader (Assault.  Has grenade launcher) and Sparks (Medic.  Currently OP as Fuck and can revive at range).

TestOutfit,3aonhl,WhitePawn00,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:09:52 2015 UTC,I haven't put any mods on it if that's what you're asking. I'm fine with modding it though. Anything specific?
TestOutfit,3aod1k,wildcatmatt360,3,Mon Jun 22 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"I know I'm too late because I got here via the post this poster was for but I do enjoy a challenge so I made this little poster. And by little I mean 9933 x 14043 at 72 ppi because why not..  Anyway, because it's so big, I couldn't upload it to imgur or even deviantart, so that's why you have a download link instead of preview there, and here's a tiny preview as well.  And this is how the shirt looks like cause you gotta have a shirt, right?... anyone? No? Oh well.."
TestOutfit,3aod1k,acustic,2,Sat Jun 27 21:00:51 2015 UTC,Not a professional artist but certainly interested. Do you have source material or ideas you'd like me to use or do you just want me to make them?  Edit: Scratch that. I'm making some right now. Give high-res screenshots plox. My pc is shit. Preferably in epic looking poses.  Edit2 : Need a slogan  Edit3 : I was bored and did a thing: http://i.imgur.com/yQnDQm4.jpg Looking for opinions on coloring and format primarily. Also really need good screenshots and a slogan.

TestOutfit,3al02j,wildcatmatt360,8,Sun Jun 21 05:56:14 2015 UTC,We also won the 3AM alert with a full platoon and and 60% territory control. This is before PCMR. Can't wait for next week
TestOutfit,3al02j,rj22497,5,Sun Jun 21 07:50:29 2015 UTC,"A good night indeed.  Saw some old faces and a lot of new ones. Saw and heard some things that I haven't in a long time,  like 30 people in TS or someone asking,  ""Which platoon am I in?"" The fights at Andvari Biolab and Pale Canyon were cool. Don't remember the last time I was part of a successful Biolab attack.   Would like to see better squad coordination, but that can come later when we have enough TESTies."
TestOutfit,3al02j,pibear,5,Sun Jun 21 08:31:02 2015 UTC,The biolab attack went perfect! We just rushed the teleporter and 10 minutes later we won.
TestOutfit,3al02j,100Rob123,4,Sun Jun 21 13:48:17 2015 UTC,I threw a random C4 and got two MAX kills. It was crazy.
TestOutfit,3al02j,Ninbyo,2,Sun Jun 21 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"I sat in a crevice on a rooftop as light assault and just shot whoever came running under. I ran out of ammo twice, which never happened before."
TestOutfit,3al02j,100Rob123,3,Sun Jun 21 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"It was great, the most fun I've had in game in a while with TEST. Nice to hear some old voices come back and a lot of new voices. It was a Saturday too, which is usually our worst night."
TestOutfit,3al7qd,finnegar,2,Sun Jun 21 07:58:24 2015 UTC,"At the conclusion of tonight's alert, during which we had 12 TESTies spread over a full platoon, we took a moment during our 59% victory to each grab galaxies and smash them in to a TR-NC bio lab battle. Despite being a two hour stalemate between them, our arrival brought the VS pop for the hex up to 42%. In the course of our shenanigans, we had at least 5 new players join the ranks of Scott's Faithful.  All in all, a great night!"
TestOutfit,3aiteh,monkey_dg1,4,Sat Jun 20 16:36:55 2015 UTC,Nice! It definitely needed updating after all this time.

TestOutfit,3ahnj9,WhitePawn00,3,Sat Jun 20 07:06:35 2015 UTC,Is Planetside 2 good again? I haven't played since the layoffs.
TestOutfit,3ahnj9,finalfrog,3,Sat Jun 20 09:03:23 2015 UTC,"I have fun. Many other people have fun. If you wanted to nit pick you'd have no problem finding issues to be mad at but I still firmly believe it's the best FPS currently on the market.   Essentially, I don't think it was ever ""bad"" at any point unless you're talking about performance or lag which I haven't seen any issues with lately.   Also considering at the best of times /r/planetside is a hive of negativity, and right now you'd have a difficult time finding any negativity on it, if say it's a good sign that the game is pretty great right now.   Also the latest patch didn't break anything. It kind of sort of dealt with maxed. Redeploy side is also being slowly phased out.   So yeah it's great come play. Ever since we've started running open squads we get regularly up to two and half or three squads full."
TestOutfit,3ahnj9,Daft_Punker,2,Sat Jun 20 09:10:50 2015 UTC,Was this a late night alert?
TestOutfit,3ahnj9,Ninbyo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:26:03 2015 UTC,Yep
TestOutfit,3ahnj9,finalfrog,2,Sat Jun 20 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"It was rough for a while, but the new team seems to have more direction and focus. They seem like they're turning things around. It's still wait and see, but it's looking better. The last patch kinda killed ""Redeployside"", so the people that relied on it a lot are flipping their shit a bit. I think that's just a kneejerk reaction to change to some degree though. Don't rely on /r/ planetside for info on the state of the game, it's more of a cesspool than ever."
TestOutfit,3ahnj9,The-Jerkbag,3,Sat Jun 20 23:36:54 2015 UTC,I unsubscribed from /r/planetside when I stopped playing.
TestOutfit,3ahnj9,TheAppleFreak,2,Sat Jun 20 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"Good choice. Should have unsubbed before you quit, tbh, mighta played longer. Would be great to have you back in the game though Frog!"

TestOutfit,3a7x5d,IrishBandit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:44:35 2015 UTC,I always wanted to buy the DLC to support the devs but the price was a bit much. It's not even for the guns. Most vanilla or mod guns are better anyways. Personal preference I suppose.
