IndieFolk,3e3lkr,EsCaRg0t,2,Tue Jul 21 22:06:30 2015 UTC,I find the whole album to be amazing. I think it is probably the best album ever made. It is pretty much tied for me with The Suburbs.   The lyrics are some of the best in the music industry along with their incredible talent as musicians. It is incredible how much meaning and emotion they can pack into their music and also show off their talent playing instruments and singing.

IndieFolk,3dy3ak,CrustaceanElation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:18 2015 UTC,Now I'm confused. What is indie folk?
IndieFolk,3dy3ak,xylum,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"""Indie folk is a music genre that arose in the 1990s from musicians in the indie (independent) rock community influenced by folk and classic country music. Indie folk combines the catchy melodies of indie rock with the acoustical sounds of contemporary folk music.""   I think that TDM3 differs from this in that they don't make use of the rock-influences. They borrow more from blue-grass and jazz I think. The differences aren't really huge, but they are there, I think."
IndieFolk,3dy3ak,CrustaceanElation,3,Mon Jul 20 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"I've always heard them called ""new-grass."""
IndieFolk,3dy3ak,GreatBallsOfFIRE,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"Not Jazz, they're combining old blues, blue grass, folk and the energy of rock. I figured they'd be a great example of indie folk. But, it's all just semantics and how you want to group things anyway. Enjoy"
IndieFolk,3dy3ak,xylum,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"I love this band, especially when they get down and shred on some bluegrassy stuff.  They transition welll between the styles and don't lose any steps in beteween, All of their releases are worth checking out."

The first song here has a unique feel that isn't present in the album. Some of his best stuff is live, and that's why he includes those versions on his albums instead of the studio versions (if he even bothers recording one).  And one big reason why I love indie folk is because it doesn't feel like it took a year and a company to produce. It's just that some humans decided to play some music because it's fun."

IndieFolk,3b2znz,jdiomede,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:32:50 2015 UTC,This is really cool! Combines my love of noise and folk at once.  Kudos!  (Not a huge fan of the whole publishing an interview with yourself on your own channel though but to each their own... interesting music!)
IndieFolk,3b2znz,greyscalereality,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"thanks! yeah, the interview was meant to be more of a joke, kind of like those you see with older artists where they reflect on their career."

I know you're not supposed to mention sex when evaluating women's music for some reason but there is something super sexy about her nudging her glasses back onto her nose every so often.  Best of luck to her with the album!
IndieFolk,3axpjn,yo_bamma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:31:34 2015 UTC,And it inspired me to write a song! Thank you!!
IndieFolk,3axpjn,yo_bamma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"Lol, Ill be sure to tell her that her glasses are a hit. When her album is closer to being finished I'll shoot a link your way."
IndieFolk,3axpjn,yo_bamma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:56:40 2015 UTC,Yeah please do!  I write for a music magazine and am not promising anything but could possibly write something up for it
