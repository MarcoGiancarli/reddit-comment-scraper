Augusta,3dzlmh,HawksAllDay226,4,Mon Jul 20 20:33:49 2015 UTC,"I've been riding bikes here for a few years. You have two major choices of places to go. Bartram Trail is great for a beginner and is 100% what you would want to start with. Fairly flat, nothing too hairy. Start at Petersburg and go east to Lake Springs and then back (or the opposite). It's 45min -1hr ride probably. (see map here).   You can also try the Lake Springs loop but I don't like it. It's too low speed (lots of sketchy tight corners) and wasn't very well taken care of when I went.  When you're comfortable with that, start at Petersburg but this time go west, the other direction. It's a little more fun with some jumps. You probably won't make it all the way to Wildwood but, if you do, kudos.  After you feel comfortable/bored/confident with these, then hit FATS. I would not recommend going to FATS until you're fairly confident on the other trails. It's a big step up. If you can't keep your speed up on FATS, you're not going to have a lot of fun. Your low speed will turn simple dips and rises into valleys and mountains, if that makes sense.  There's a few other trails around town, but those are the two big sets."

Augusta,3dzlmh,warthog912,2,Mon Jul 20 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"There is a decent trail off of the canal. You can get to it from either side of the canal, but it's quicker to get to from the Richmond County side, behind Lake Olmstead.  Follow the canal trail for about 1-2 miles. You will end up on a paved path with railroad tracks. Once you cross the tracks turn right, yes over the rocks. Follow the tracks for about 100 feet and on your left you will see the entrance to the mountain bike trail.    It's a fun one, be safe!"

Augusta,3d9qe2,ItsAllZerosAndOnes,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed seems to have a lot of legitimate postings on it, as it just crawls other sites for job vacancies. I wouldn't recommend posting your resume because that will attract scammers, but the postings themselves are nearly always legitimate (you are directed to actual corporate sites).   Also, the temp agencies really only work for the most obnoxious of people. As in? the squeaky wheel gets the grease. You should be checking in at least once a week with each. They will find you something to get you to leave them alone if you have anything to offer on your resume.   The job market sucks in Augusta, but we just have to stay proactive as possible."

When you get your bill call them again and give them the total number of outages with the ticket numbers.   I had issues with their service about 2 years ago. They credited me for almost 2 full months. I had a list of date and times with ticket numbers for each instance. Also if it's only causing you and your neighbors an issue make sure the techs they send out check the lines from your location to the closest node.   I'm on Business class so it's a little different but they should definitely credit you for the outages.

They don't allow pets but they have a pool and a workout room in the clubhouse. They were always friendly, helpful, and quick to fix things. It is located in between exit 199 and 200 off of the i20. It is pretty convenient to everything. Realistically I don't think you can find an apt for $700 a month right next to fort Gordon. Good luck with your move and the new baby.

There are many different townhouse complexes in the area that rent for about $750 a month for 2 br/2 ba in the Grovetown and Evans area. Maybe check Zillow/Trulia for these rentals.

Augusta,3bc91k,DerFuhrersStache,2,Sun Jun 28 04:00:24 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Monterey and Pablona's are both pretty bad.  I don't know if they do well here just because they are bigger sit-down restaurants.  I think living on the border with Mexico for five years also put me around a lot of really good Mexican food so now I have standards.   Salsa's in Evans is way better.  Mi Riconcito in Grovetown is really good.
