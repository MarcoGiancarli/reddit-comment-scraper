StreetFighter,3e1uu6,SmugDa_Beast94,43,Tue Jul 21 08:50:16 2015 UTC,"Hi Smug,  Great that you're taking the time for an AMA. Some questions:   What specifically are the upsides of using pad for Dudley? Any true downsides to it too? I see you using victory rose setups in the corner a lot. Did the buff to this move really make such a difference for Dudley? Your match against Momochi at CEO 2015 was insane. One of the noticeable things was how you kept your composure in dire and confusing situations. Was this something that has been present in you since vanilla, or is it something you have trained to do?   Thanks man, great to see you on these boards."
StreetFighter,3e1uu6,Argon7,69,Tue Jul 21 10:08:35 2015 UTC,What character so far in SFV are you most likely to pick up?

He said it was different, but he could get used to it pretty easily. If he hadn't said so, I wouldn't have been able to tell he was using an unfamiliar controller judging from his game play."
StreetFighter,3e1uu6,EX-Tricky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"That's gonna be an issue.  The Dual Shock 4 is currently always using Bluetooth to communicate with the PS4 even when wired which means that it likely won't be allowed at EVO and other tournaments. Even if it was allowed, I don't think anyone would want to play with unnecessary input lag.  The only way around right now is to use a wired third-party controller."

How do you avoid picking up bad habits from playing mostly online?   Do you think playing an less popular/common character negates some of disadvantages of being lower on the tier list? Thinking mostly of Ai Ai since I havent seen a high level Juri, while seeing high level Evil from almost all the high level players. Also assuming that everyone knows the Evil matchup in and out, while Juri and like Decapre being somewhat rare"

So, two questions:   1). Do you feel like you're at a disadvantage in larger tournaments like EVO, given the fact that your character pick and tells are very much out in the open, moreso than they were at even this time last year?  2)Do you feel that having pocket characters is necessary in a game like Ultra, where the game is so well balanced? For instance, do you think Dudley has the tools to deal with any character archtype, or is it more about playing against your physical opponent, their choices, and their playstyle?   Thanks, Smug. Good luck this year."

I wanted to create a team that would sustain the organic Form or shit talking competition. Lee chung, who is great with wordplay created the name. He actually creates the name for all the events. Lee chung being good friends with Daffy and chin while me bing good friends with Sci, made sense to have them all aboard because they shared the same passion to play games part time, kick ass and talk shit.   We then brought on poem. A year later we brought on zeus and 6 months layer we brought on Smug.

How do you usually approach Dudley's difficult match-ups? Who's on your list of Top 5 American players? Do you pick up anything from online match-ups aside from experience (i.e. Do you pick up on any psychological tendencies from people with 'online habits')? Do you think playing online is a good way to start learning the game and is it a viable alternative to playing locally?"

StreetFighter,3e2wrw,RunicSSB,3,Tue Jul 21 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty close, but not identical. Some of the differences affect things like how reversals work and could thus have a non-trivial effect on gameplay.  Also, most of the good ST players are stubborn old men set in their ways, and they hate the new backgrounds and character sprites. Their attitude is ""why play a version that's pretty close when we can have actual cabs for the real thing at Evo?"" Nostalgia probably has more than a little to do with it."

StreetFighter,3e30pw,Fedatu,7,Tue Jul 21 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"no time limit   I wonder if this means Necalli has 4 bars of V-Gauge, since the 3-Bar V-Triggers last extremely long already. Interesting character..."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,unjson,5,Tue Jul 21 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"He's one of the few characters that can combo into his V-Skill, and has a reason to use it often in neutral. So, it's not a totally crazy thought."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Merkilo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:32 2015 UTC,Ken can combo into vskill as well and probably chun off a deep jump in
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Handslaps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:20 2015 UTC,You are right. Chun can combo into her Vskill from a jump in.
StreetFighter,3e30pw,king_awesome,6,Tue Jul 21 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"His V-Trigger is essentially a stance that costs meter to activate. So to balance that he loses his V-Reversal, making you choose between offense and defense. So I don't think it would cost a lot of bars to use V-Trigger as it's the only V-Trigger (so far) with a built in downside."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,unjson,5,Tue Jul 21 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, every character looses the ability to V-Reversal when he/she activates V-Trigger. The risk is just much more pronounced on Necalli since it's a choice you have to commit to for the rest of the round."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,fischbs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:34 2015 UTC,Looks to me like he still has a V-Reversal.

StreetFighter,3e30pw,Nybear21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that means his defensive options are pretty bad and he's going to rely on his V-Reversal pre-power up to get out of pressure. After powerup, he'll rely on being the one pressuring so that hole in his game can't be exploited."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,NecromancyBlack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"We've seen V-triggers used to hit opponents out of CA and prevent losing to chip, so it could be worth it. I get the feeling that most people don't know the actual power of V-Reversals yet. They could be really good, or maybe they are meh and this V-Trigger needs more nerfs."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,7,Tue Jul 21 21:55:50 2015 UTC,They're taking a bunch of cues from Killer Instinct and i am digging it.
StreetFighter,3e30pw,daily_q,4,Tue Jul 21 16:20:34 2015 UTC,Which cues for those that haven't played KI?
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,11,Tue Jul 21 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"The entire idea that characters have their own distinct and separate traits on top of moves is taken from KI. When it comes to playstyles and variation, KI's character roster is the most diverse in any western FG by some distance. SFV is building on that and making the main/only way to build the V-meter is by utilizing the characters unique trait in a match, dictating the playstyle even more.   EDIT: I can't stress how important that point is. Most of the time when you hear someone bitching about SF4 or MVC3 they're not bitching about the player as much as about the way the game forces them to play. In those games every character is bound to the same core mechanic, be it Focus/crouchtech/plinking, TAC/Infinites or what have you. With KI you have the breaker/shadowbreaker/counterbreaker system which is pretty effective but that's mainly supplementary - every character is an entirely new game unto themselves with new mechanics. SFV definitely seems to be going that way too with their emphasis on character individuality, and this is definitely a good thing for the longevity of the game.   V-triggers are pretty much Instinct Mode, an extra mechanic which every character has a distinct one to themselves that shouuld be the main focus of every round and drastically changes the round when activated.   V-Reversals are pretty much Combo Breakers/Breakers from MK, but i like that SF didn't make them completely free to use.  From the looks of it, just like in KI, you're gonna need more than one character under your belt. Characters being so diverse means that there's gonna be some ugly matchups no matter how hard they try and smooth it out. Hell, Rico just won KI and he had to play 6 characters, nearly half the cast, to do it.   There's also the theory/idea that KI is the catalyst for SFV being Sony exclusive.  Even these character trailers seem just like the KI ones. Round intro, demo of moves, demo of special moves, combo demo, v-trigger demo, ultra, win quote, (usually a tease for next guy but this last one didn't have it)  EDIT No. 4,000: The simpler inputs and links also.  Not that i'm saying any of this is a bad thing, infact i'm kinda loving all of it. But there's a lot of callbacks."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Nybear21,10,Tue Jul 21 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"Only 2 parts I diagree with.  1 V-Reversals are Alpha Counters which originated in SF to start with.  2 I would say KI has a very low alt character requirement. In fact, probably the lowest in current fighting games. Many top players only play 1 character competitively."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,5,Tue Jul 21 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"You could argue that's why there hasn't been a consistent 'top guy' in KI competitively apart from Rico.  Also KI came out before Alpha, 94/95"
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Nybear21,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say Rico still has a few more wins to be on par with CDJR if we're looking at the game's entire lifespan.   As for causes though, I'd personally attribute that to some of KI's other successes. The roster is very well balanced apart from a few outliers, which greatly opens up your player pool to do well. There's also no default gameplay style thay has proven dominant, which again exponentially opens up the player base who has a chance of being competitive."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"CDJR    Doesn't he use Sadira, Maya and TJC? I've definitely seen him win tournaments with the first 2."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Nybear21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:39 2015 UTC,"He has changed characters, but he made a pretty hard switch each time. When he maining Maya, TJ and Sadira were not seen any longer."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Beginning_End,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think that's one of the things I like the most about getting rid of Focus. I'm not bound to some core game mechanic that I don't even like using and instead can find a character who's special mechanics suit my play style, which Focus did not. Everything else I'll have to deal with seems to be classic Street Fighter.   I'm way more excited about what I've seen so far than I expected to be. Now, as long as they don't completely ruin Guile (or they don't have some similar styled replacement) I feel pretty confident in the fact that this will be a great game for me."

StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,2,Tue Jul 21 21:23:55 2015 UTC,KI came out a year before Alpha.

Mobas algo use that and try to make their characters unique, diverse and give them a presentation (In their own ways at least). I really like this in general, in fighting games and in Mobas and only makes me look foward to see the next new chatacters and also playing as then."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"Speaking of which SFV looks to be taking their character unlocking cue from MOBAs, in particular Heroes of the Storm."

StreetFighter,3e30pw,Beginning_End,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"The fact that they've changed their model to, ""Street Fighter V will be a service."" told me that they are heading in the right direction."

StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,3,Tue Jul 21 20:35:47 2015 UTC,but i like that SF didn't make them completely free to use.
StreetFighter,3e30pw,BlueFreedom420,-8,Tue Jul 21 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"I think you are wrong. The characters do not have a distinct traits. Pressing MP +MK does not equal unique. For example, pressing V skill merely makes ken do what he has always done in previous SFs.  The characters in KI are far more unique and balanced than any SF character. You see a character like Khan ra  who is similar playstyle to Dhalsim make it all the way to grand finals at EVO. You will never see a SIM at top evo unless he is a counter pick.  Cinder is another example of something you will never see SF.  Combo breakers require skill to use, require no meter, and have a deep counter system.  V Reversal is probably a crutch capcom will use to keep rush down character OP."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,Bladeviper,5,Tue Jul 21 19:43:32 2015 UTC,what? how are they not unique? Just because they have a unified input does not mean they are not unique. Does nash have a parry like ryu does with that input? Or does anyone else transform like Necalli with the input? No then they are unique

StreetFighter,3e30pw,BlueFreedom420,-6,Tue Jul 21 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"How is a parry unique? How is running unique? Cinder lobs bombs on his opponent, creating a pressure situation.  Glacius can give himself armor.   Im talking about overall uniqueness. SF V has the same level of uniqueness capcom has always given their characters.  KI's characters are very different from each other, and not from just pressing MP+ MK.  Ken and Ryu are very close to each other with only small differences.  While Jago and Orchid are quite different."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,0,Tue Jul 21 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"How is a parry unique?   Because only one character has it.   How is running unique?    Because only one character has it.  Using your argument, how are bombs and armor unique, then? Dummy."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,BlueFreedom420,0,Tue Jul 21 21:37:23 2015 UTC,listen moron. You are comparing the uniqueness that KI gives it characters to the same crap we've seen in SF. Parry is not unique mechanic when looking at fighting games in general. Cinder's bomb toss is completely unique to all fighting games. The latest character released on KI is completely unique to KI.   You fanbois are so excited that you make stupid comparisons.  Run is not unique. Its a one press dash attack.  V reversals are  not combo breakers. Combo breakers is a deeper system than that.
StreetFighter,3e30pw,BlueFreedom420,0,Tue Jul 21 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"A parry is unique because no one else in the game has one. A run is unique because no one else in the game has one. Ken's V-Skill doesn't function remotely like his step kick did in any game before this and is only comparable by the animation, which is generally not even preformed in this game and is just cancelled for Run Pressure. Instinct is popped using HK+HP between all characters, and I suppose by your logic makes the entire system itself not unique."
StreetFighter,3e30pw,brettawesome,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"""SF V has the same level of uniqueness capcom has always given their characters. KI's characters are very different from each other, and not from just pressing MP+ MK""  Cant have logic if you don't read. I know I hurt your fanboi feelings, but KI characters are far more unique to each other than any SF -that was one of my points. There are no characters in KI that even play close to each other. Yet I can pick up SF and play ken just like ryu."

StreetFighter,3e3p08,Rawck,22,Tue Jul 21 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"At a low level, both characters are very similar. But at high level, in a nutshell:  Ryu is a very fundamental, zoning-oriented character. His most comfortable neutral game is at about 1/2 to 3/4 screen distance, where he can throw fireballs and punish opponents accordingly for jumping over them. Most of the time, Ryu wants to create space. This is why most of his moves cause knockdown and/or push opponents far away. He excels at footsies, which is the act of controlling space using your normals. Ryu generally wants to out-think and outsmart his opponent.  Ken, on the other hand, is a flashier, more aggressive fighter. He excels in the 1/2 screen distance range and closer, where he can pressure his opponents with high-low mixups and crossups. While Ken can also zone with fireballs much like Ryu can, Ken's moveset is oriented towards closing distance rather than creating it, which is why many of his moves do not knockdown and leave Ken fairly close to his opponent so that he can continue his offensive game. Ken generally wants to overwhelm his opponent.  Both characters are great choices. Depending on your familiarity with the game, Ryu is usually a better choice just to start out to help you learn zoning and spatial control, but both are very good."
StreetFighter,3e3p08,Exvaris,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! This was very helpful. Do you know what Ultra is considered the best?"
StreetFighter,3e3p08,Nybear21,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:33 2015 UTC,"For Ryu, Ultra 1.   For Ken, Ultra 1 for damage because you can FADC into it. Ultra 2 if the opponent is a heavy projectile character, as it goes through projectiles and you can punish them."
StreetFighter,3e3p08,Skoorbnut,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:29 2015 UTC,For Ken Ultra 2 can also be combo'd into via cr.mk xx fireball FADC Ultra 2. Although not the same damage output as Ultra 1.
StreetFighter,3e3p08,bitchesandsake,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:50 2015 UTC,Also can get it off of an EX tatsu jumpin

StreetFighter,3e3p08,Exvaris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Like the other posters have said, both characters' Ultra 1 is better. I think Ken's Ultra 2 has slightly more utility than Ryu's Ultra 2 since it goes through projectiles, but I'd still use Ken's Ultra 1 99% of the time."
StreetFighter,3e3p08,AymJ,4,Tue Jul 21 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"Ryu is more neutral oriented and more defensive. He has better fireballs(very different speed) and cr.mk. Whilst Ken is more offensive with a better shoryu (cancelable on second hit), kara throw, f+mk to pressure, ex tatsu crossup etc They are very different characters overall."
StreetFighter,3e3p08,quuser,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:46 2015 UTC,Is Ken's shoryu better? I know his h.dp has more reach and can be FADC'd but Ryu's DPs seem better for anti airing overall.
StreetFighter,3e3p08,bitchesandsake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only advantage Ken's DP has is the hit-confirm, really."
StreetFighter,3e3p08,Skoorbnut,3,Tue Jul 21 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"So a quick rundown.  Ryu is all about spacing and footsies. He has a few heavy hitting combos, but his ideal fight is to keep his opponent at the end of his cr. mk fireball, get them to jump and anti air. Compared to ken he is more ""defensive"". With that said Ryu has the tools to go in on the opponent, at the end of the day how you play Ryu is up to you.  Ken is a much more offensive oriented shoto. He has a great poke in his forward medium kick (step kick) as well as a great air tatsu for getting in. Ken's fireball game is much weaker than Ryu's. Ken is the bully out of these two.   Hopefully this helps as a quick overview as to how they are different. But I don't think its a bad idea to learn either characters as, in a nutshell, they are very similiar. It's all about the type of player you are."
StreetFighter,3e3p08,rawbertson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:34 2015 UTC,ken - kara throw  step kick  thunder kick (overhead)  slower recovery on fireball  tatsu does not knockdown (useful to know for EX tatsu)  dp Ultra and custom combo ultra  Ryu -  faster recovery on fireballs  solar plexus  ultra 1 fireball ultra 2 DP  most of their pokes are the same other than that i probably missed something but generally thats the difference in their move set of the normals you see regularly
StreetFighter,3e3p08,BlueFreedom420,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:23:15 2015 UTC,Ken is mix ups. Ryu is fundamentals with minor zoning.

What do you guys think of this? Good idea or not?  I can kind of see why you'd want to, but I also kind of can't. I feel like learning the different play-styles is what really matters, not so much the characters.  Like if I'm really good with Cammy, am I going to benefit from learning Yun? Not really, unless I'm having trouble fighting him, I don't see why I would put a lot of time into learning how to play him.  I know they're trying to make each character in SFV more unique, so I guess it might be worth doing. Obviously, I'll learn the moves of each character in training mode, learn a few combos and play a few matches. But trying to get good with everyone seems like a bit of a mission. I think I'll be sticking to Ryu and one or two others for now."

StreetFighter,3e2a1d,bitchesandsake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I suspect there's a balance between playing one character exclusively, to the point where you get myopic about the game as a whole because of it and (especially early on) may not understand how a lot of the characters work, and playing too many characters, to the point where you don't get good at any of them and rely on counterpicking instead of learning how to overcome difficult obstacles.   Ideally, you want to have a very small number of characters you're very good at, and be at least kind of able to play many more. Being good at one character is already a Herculean task; don't try to push it until you're satisfied with your current skill level on your main."

This isn't my first fighting game, i have been playing smash bros melee for the past year competitively so i understand the basics of a fighting game. When it comes to this game, i watch videos of people playing and think its a really cool game, then when i play i just get destroyed and lose all motivation to play, and then i watch videos and think its cool, which just continues the vicious cycle.  I get frustrated with things like not being able to link combos after sitting in training and practicing them, messing up input shapes after sitting in training and practicing them, my opponent escaping after i knock them over (It seems like they can always do something to get away/attack back before i can stop them), vsing people with high pp, etc.  I really want to play this game but i dont know how to get over this hump and i wana know if anyone else had this problem and how they got over it.  For reference: I have a stick, approx 80ish hours of playtime (between ps4 and steam), I played Ryu for the first couple weeks, then switched to Yang, and i know how to plank and have practiced it a good amount.

StreetFighter,3e2a1d,NanchoMan,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:48 2015 UTC,"WALL OF TEXT INCOMING  tl;dr -- Stick with it! You'll learn it bit by bit!  Couple things to keep in mind.  First, the game first came to consoles in 2009, so a lot of players have been playing this game for YEARS. You will not be able to catch up with them any time soon, because the learning curve is steep and they're years ahead of you. And with SF5 around the corner, you will not catch up to most of these players by the time everyone mostly moves on to SF5.  But that's okay! You can use SF4 as a tool for learning how the SF series plays on a more fundamental level. Things like spacing and footsies, mixups, etc., will definitely transfer to other games and (importantly) SF5. You can learn these things conceptually through SF4, and when SF5 comes out, everyone will be operating on the same shallow character and matchup knowledge, since the game will be so new. And that'll be a chance for you to learn the game alongside everyone else and distinguish yourself.  Second, SF4 is about incremental progress, especially since you're coming into it so late. There are so many things happening at one time during a match, so many things you have to account for to play at a high level -- spacing and footsies, pokes and counter pokes, jump ins, anti-airs, combos, punishes, option selects, mixups, threat of ultra, frame traps, your moves/hitboxes/frames, your opponent's moves/hitboxes/frames, your opponent's play style, your opponent's attack patterns. It's impossible to improve at all of these things at once, because in the beginning, there's way too much for a beginner to keep track of.  So for people like you and me -- who got into SF4 late -- we have to narrow down what we expect to get from this game. We need to focus on a few core things and build on it incrementally. So when you go into a match, you'll likely be playing someone with loads more experience than you, and you should focus on improving one or two areas specifically. For example, ""I'm gonna watch out for jump-ins from my opponent so I can improve my anti-air consistency."" Or, ""I'm going to focus on throwing fireballs from SAFE distances so I learn not to get punished during the fireball game."" Or, ""I want to land this specific combo without effing it up."" Etc.  Over time, you'll get the hang of these fundamental aspects of the game, and then you'll start focusing on other areas of your play. As all these things come together, you'll notice you'll start winning matches. Maybe not all the time, not all at once, but every now and then. And you'll keep improving from there.  This game can definitely be frustrating as hell. But you have to look at it like any other skill -- playing the guitar, learning to draw, programming. You don't get good at anything without lots of dedication, hard work, and practice.  And, importantly, an attitude that takes the long view."

StreetFighter,3e2a1d,Novelty_Frog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yes both are possible, but you have to be extremely accurate with the timing on the flash kick of the second one, is it barely gives you enough time to cancel it"
StreetFighter,3e2a1d,NanchoMan,0,Tue Jul 21 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"If you land a level 3 red focus and absorb some hits along the way, you're probably better off doing raw ultra and let your white health recover. Anyways,   Hitconfirm off of a crumple probably isn't the best idea due to scaling and the second cr.lp might push you out of range to FADC the flash kick. Otherwise, it should work You won't have enough time to charge the flash kick if you want to UDK (EDIT: Unless if your opponent whiffs a super/ultra during UDK like Zangief.) You could try UDK > cr.mp xx lp SB > sweep instead for a quick punish and KD."

StreetFighter,3e2a1d,notfluent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"I know that some people may switch out the light/hard punch/kick variants with each other so that the light punch/kick will always be on the trigger/bumper for easier plinking. Other than that, people can do wildly different setups based on what is most comfortable to you.  You could always sacrifice one of your PPP or KKK buttons to bind focus attack or throw to make those actions easier; as long as it's within the game's options, it should be perfectly legal in tournament play.  Some players find it easier to play using claw style on pad, I'll link a video of what it looks like soon. It lets you use more fingers to hit buttons, but some people find it simply uncomfortable to hold a controller like that."

You're likely to pick up bad habits if you start with Cammy.  So she's not an ideal choice for a beginner but she's not a bad choice either. Her combos are relatively easy, she has good normals and good anti airs."
StreetFighter,3e468x,IMashButtons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"Bad habits are easily fixable in my opinion. I mean, YOLO Cannon Strikes aren't fundamentals, but there are definitely times where things like that are appropriate with a good read. Better that you learn when and when it doesn't work to explore all the options of the character.  I mean, Allioune gets away with Cannon Strikes when he notices the opponent not respecting it and being too reactionary in the footsie game and overly trying to space bait by walking. Nemo does it with Rolento sweep when they forget that option. Gamerbee's Elena did it to catch Chun during Losers Finals a few times as well.  Bad habits are still viable in certain situations. I say have them experiment and learn what works and doesn't in my opinion.  Play Cammy. She's fun. You'll learn about facerolling through an opponent with her."
StreetFighter,3e468x,NoobAtLife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"While she isn't necessarily a good choice in terms of a fundamental learning. She isn't too hard to get the hang of, but she can lead you into a bit of an auto piloted kind of play where if your plans don't work, suddenly your lost and can't approach new problems.  While playing characters like ryu or guile is ""better"", I say the highest priority is playing a character that makes you want to spend time playing this game. So if for you its cammy, play her."
StreetFighter,3e468x,kastle09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"She's not going to be the easiest pick, but I think she has some qualities going for her. She has no safe special moves, so she'll make you get good at hit confirming. On that same note, she's also going to force you to get comfortable playing a solid neutral game or you're going to get blown up really hard.  She is one of those characters you kind of ""just do stuff"" and gets wins online. Just take the advice now, that's not going to get you very far. It's going to be frustrating learning to play solid fundamentals and not go nuts, but it is well worth it."

In neutral all you can think about is getting in and starting offense, which for a long time is just going to get you killed. Dropping a hitconfirm or combo in general will leave you at a massive frame disadvantage and get your ass whooped. I started improving a lot more in neutral by playing Ryu and Poison, once you ""get"" the game a little better is when you can more effectively play whoever you like."

StreetFighter,3e1zl7,Clenching,4,Tue Jul 21 09:55:04 2015 UTC,"As a an avid pad player myself I too was curious to see if I could come up with a way to do this when Decapre came out. After some experimenting I found a way!  First, your controller should be set up to use the default configuration, meaning L1 and L2 are PPP and KKK. I hold the controller normally, not in a claw style or faux-fightstick grip or something like that. Now, the motion. I'll try to describe this as best as I can through text.  The first motion is a MK and HP right after, as if you were plinking them (though a plink timing is not strictly necessary). Then immediately following tap PPP with your left index finger, make sure it's released, then use your thumb and index finger to quickly hit MP and HP. HOLD THEM DOWN and hit PPP again. This causes only LP to come out when pressing PPP.   If you do it right, the inputs look like this  The tricky part is getting the rhythm down so you don't go too slow or too fast. Once you have the rhythm tough it becomes extremely easy, I don't play Decapre and using the Xbox 360 pad I can hit this over 90% of the time."

I used to play Super all the time until AE come out, now I've purchased Ultra and have been playing for a week. I'm trying to main Vega (which has been a little difficult as I'm re-learning the game) but have considered looking at other characters to main as the whole cast is really pretty cool! I find Vega to be among the coolest, but I'm not sure if he fits my playstyle (no idea what my playstyle even is.)   I've uploaded what I consider one of my cleanest losses yet: https://youtu.be/ar70kBt6mjQ  Here's my own points.    Plenty of punish opportunities, but I was afraid of throws and jump-ins.  Yeah, jumps ins and throws messed me up pretty bad. I know Vega's anti-air options are somewhat weak, but it looks like I somehow forgot Scarlet Terror that may have saved me a few times. I got flustered at the end and essentially gave up. Rude, I know, but that's why the taunt is in there.    Any critique, info or advice is really appreciated.

This guy was jumping, using air tatsus, and ground tatsus to get in your face. At no point did he try to establish any kind of ground game or fireball game.    Whenever you knocked him down or achieved any kind of advantage he would DP or use his meter to get out of the situation. The one time he did nothing on wake up... it was because he tried to wake up backdash but he messed up the timing.    0:20 - I'm not 100% sure, but I think you could have followed up that focus attack with a sweep.  0:48 - It looks like you tried to bait something with the neutral jump. Not sure what you thought he was gonna do. But, it was pretty unsafe and he could have done a lot of things to punish you for it. Luckily he only tapped you with a hit from his U2.    0:56 - You charged up a Level 3 Focus Attack at a pretty bad time and range.    Most of what he did could have caught you by surprise in Round 1. By round 2, you should have realized his playstyle and met it with a lot of patience and conservative play. Just let him kill himself off of the mistakes and risks he takes.    I won't talk about specific times you could have punished since you already mentioned that in your post. Overall, you got beat by a lot of random stuff. But I think it's something you can easily fix next time by deciding to play lame and let him beat himself via his wild playstyle."

StreetFighter,3e29bc,Buttmunch95,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:29 2015 UTC,"Treat SF like any RPG esque game. Every enemy is a boss fight with its own mechanics, adding in the human factor as a randomizer, you can say that this version of the boss or ""ryu"" will do X a lot based on what you have seen. This means that you should keep in mind what ryu can do as a character, and look at what your enemy is doing as a player to understand how the match will flow.  Next you need as little distraction from getting your job done as possible; therefore, forget winning. Getting desperate for the win you will rush your game mess up and get flustered, never give up keep a calm head and think vicariously about what the enemy will do to close out the match/ counter what you are doing etc... keep in mind what your enemy can do in every situation and play around it.  For example, in a high level match player X is on chip damage but he scored a knock down on player Y, Y can reversal DP and kill X with chip damage. Yet X still walks up to Y while they are down and then grabs Y and wins the game. This would happen because Y may have though that X was baiting out the DP since X is a smart player and knows he would die from a reversal DP, so Y tries to be smarter and waits; however, X was really smart thought of that plan and got the grab much to Y's surprise. If Y was a bad player they would not have though of that and panic DPed.  Point is the smarter the player the more complex their thinking and application of their options. Vs low level players either do something they can't counter I.E. a safe jump or control the space and give them very little to work with. the simpler your play the less opportunities your enemy has.  Finally, as with scripted fights in other video games, when a boss whiffs a big move you know that you have a chance to deal big damage, and over time you know the best damaging sequence for each context and because you play that game a lot you know what each boss in the game does and what they look like when they whiff. It's the same thing in SF there are universal whiffs you can punish I.E. in footsies and there are specifics I.E. special moves, the more you play the game the more you'll know what to punish with what combo. Don't look at a huge whiffed/blocked HP DP from ryu and just grab, no do the most damage you can do with as little meter spent as possible then go back to your best distance and let the enemy hang themselves.  Anyway even though it's a bit rushed I hoped this helps."
StreetFighter,3e29bc,rastafu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:12 2015 UTC,That was quite in depth thinking to me o_o. Thank you so much!
StreetFighter,3e29bc,Buttmunch95,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"I wanted to add that what I meant about forgetting about winning, was focus on what you can learn from each match rather than winning. Winning is only enjoyable when it shows you have overcome a hurdle or won a tournament or beaten a player you have never been able to beat. Pros can play 1000000s of games and not care about the wins and losses, all they care about is what they have learnt from those games and how they can translate it into tournament performance.  GL and HF with your game my friend."
StreetFighter,3e29bc,rastafu,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, here is my video  Some of the biggest things I notice about my offense is that I have a tough time gauging distances for different jump in's. I usually get blown up by safe jumps and crossups because I can't reliably anti air them. Many times during this match, the dude would jump a lot, and I would either just block or run away. I did get a few nice anti airs however. Also, I think I need to start crouch teching more, because I get grabbed so much, it's annoying.  A big thing I noticed in the second round is just how often I mess up tech. I missed some FKs because I didn't charge long enough, I missed some anti airs, I missed SBs. I switched to an arcade stick a few days ago, so it's been weird, but I think I like it a lot more than the pad I was using.  So I need to go into training room for a few days (which is tough because opponents are just a few menus away), and I need to react to what my opponent is doing, rather than fall into my own rut of doing moves and hoping he walks into them.  Thoughts?"
StreetFighter,3e29bc,NanchoMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to specifically crouch tech more. You can stand tech as well. Or even throw out some jabs or shorts. But, you should do something when he goes for the same grab setups.    0:22 - After you successfully punished his whiff grab you jumped back to create some space, then you walked back even further. I feel like you gave up a lot of ground here unnecessarily.    0:49 - He blocked your jump in but you continued the pressure with a sweep. That's really unsafe. Was this a missed input?    0:52 - He jumped (again) and it looks like you tried to air to air with a j. hk. But, you could have just used cr. hp and won the round easily.    1:14 - I think the correct punish here would have been cr. mp xx EX Flash kick. I'm not even sure Guile's air throw CAN punish in that situation.    1:32 - It looks like you messed up your input on flash kick. I think you tried to do a HK Flash kick to punish his whiff, however I don't think it would have hit anyway. You could have swept him or EX Sonic Boom'd.    1:55 - He dropped a combo (again) and you punished with a raw flash kick. If you had waited for him to land you could have done a better punish and won the round.    I think overall you need to feel more confident staying your ground. You took away his air approaches (at times), but then you didn't establish a ground game. You always let him dictate the pace and you played reactionary. Also, you need to work on your punishes. I'm not a Guile main, but these are just a few things I noticed from your match. Keep practicing and good luck man!"
StreetFighter,3e29bc,cynistar742,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:10 2015 UTC,":19 - dropped combo, probably could have gone for a sweep.  seemed kind of obvious that you would hit it but idk.  :28 - you obviously wanted cr. fierce here, and not cr. forward.  :41 - the jump-in looked like it was at the perfect space for anti-dp (and it was), so I would have tried to block.  :50 - bad random sweep.  he could have focused the last part, though it probably wouldn't have crumpled, but it's still free damage for him.  :53 - can't tell if you tried to intentionally hit his jump-in by doing a jump-in of your own on reaction, but i don't think jumping was the right idea.  you could have played defense on the ground.  you're one hit away from winning.  all you need to do is play solid defense.    1:13 - why not meaty sonic boom?  it would have been safe from reversal flash kick, adds chip damage, and creates more space for you while you have the life lead.  this is a matchup where having the life lead and space control are all pretty damn crucial.  1:14 - did you try to air throw?  not really sure what else you could have done but you could have stuck to a very basic cr. strong into rh flash kick punish.  no good reason to do air throw there when cr. strong into rh flash kick would have done more damage and fine position.  1:19 - he caught you with this exact same setup at :41.  you needed to realize quicker that it's a setup where flash kick will not bail you out.  1:27 - he focused your sonic boom, but failed to dash out of it.  pretty certain you could have taken an extra step and smacked him with a spinning backfist.  1:32 - did you try to punish his flash kick with one of your own? you didn't seem to have enough charge and/or messed up your input.  i would also do upback instead of upforward when doing flash kick, just so you don't aimlessly throw your body at him if you mess up your input.  if you weren't confident in having enough charge, stick to spnning backfist or sweep at that distance.  1:35 - okay, so he did the exact same backthrow setup from :41 and 1:19.  the delayed tech was good enough to deal with it, but the dashing part was not.  his setup clearly only works well if you don't do delayed tech.  you should have dealyed tech and blocked.  1:43 - I don't really like that hard read on doing an air throw in the event he jumps back.  it would have looked pretty if it worked, but I don't think he really gave you any reason to believe that he would do that.  if he had a tendency, then I might respect it more, but I think there were much better options to deal with him jumping back, such doing a lot of cr. short pressure.  that would have been a much better, versatile idea.  1:55 - he missed his combo, and now you are about to punish his flash kick.  you can ultra (easy), or you can super (also easy but you would burn all of your resources for the next round when doing ultra would be just as easy).  if for some reason you didn't have charge, you could have done a back throw to get him cornered, then do a meaty U2 and play good defense from there.  Remember that you're playing Guile, so space is a valuable resource to you.  Play solid defense and try not to give up too much ground.  When you can, try to regain some of the ground you lost.  You can do this by doing a backthrow if you're cornered, or dashing up once or twice if you land a knockdown.  I also don't remember you using st. roundhouse at all, but that's a pretty good move.  Also, don't be afraid to use st. fierce if they are closing in on you.   That's a damaging and quick move which is an excellent option to keep them out.   Some of the biggest things I notice about my offense is that I have a tough time gauging distances for different jump in's. I usually get blown up by safe jumps and crossups because I can't reliably anti air them. Many times during this match, the dude would jump a lot, and I would either just block or run away. I did get a few nice anti airs however. Also, I think I need to start crouch teching more, because I get grabbed so much, it's annoying.   Yeah, get used to all of the antiairs you can use and at what ranges they need to be used.  Guile has a lottttttt of antiairs.  Don't forget about st. forward, but do it without holding a direction, because you'll get Rolling Sobat otherwise (which I think can also be used as an antiair in certain situations, lol).  Crouch teching isn't horrible but it's not as good as it used to be.  Mostly everyone have good frame traps under their belts, and that completely destroys crouch teching.  Standing up and trying to tech the throw with a throw of your own is probably better, because you get a couple extra frames that allow you to tech the throw by doing this.  Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, but don't live by crouch teching.   So I need to go into training room for a few days (which is tough because opponents are just a few menus away), and I need to react to what my opponent is doing, rather than fall into my own rut of doing moves and hoping he walks into them.   I mean, sometimes when you throw out a move like st. fierce, st. roundhouse, or cr. forward, you're hoping they will run into it.  You're doing it to control space so you can safely throw sonic booms when you're at a comfortable distance.  It's not an unreasonable thing to throw out moves, because even if they whiff, it makes them a bit afraid to try to encroach.  However, be careful of people who are good with footsies and general whiff punishing."
StreetFighter,3e29bc,TheFragile_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"Just one comment this time. The others guys did some pretty thorough analysis but both were wrong about the proper punish for those dropped-combo flash kicks that you missed your punish on...   The close range punish for guile, assuming you don't have ultra, always starts with the Guile High Kick (the down-forward launcher kick). Not just because it does a lot of damage and stun, but also because it doesn't require a cancel to combo and can also buy you some time to build charge while they're still in the juggle state. Another bonus is that you don't have to wait for them to hit the ground if you're worried they might try and throw out another invincible move once they've landed (like when playing against a DP crazed Ken online.)  Depending on how punishable they are, you can sometimes even walk up to them, charge for a handful of frames, throw out the kick and build enough charge while they're in the air to still hit them with a flash kick. If you have meter, make sure it's an ex flash kick.   If worse comes to worst and you can't build charge but you can walk up and land the GHK, just finish with back or neutral St.HP. You don't need to be right up on them for this combo, either, the St.HP will tag them even if your at almost maximum range of the GHK as long as you get the punch out on the first frame or two (practice plinking this)."

StreetFighter,3e3v6a,LogicManifesto,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, Momochi's Ken is very methodical whereas Chris T plays a more risky Ken that relies more on offense."

StreetFighter,3e3v6a,rannos,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:37:22 2015 UTC,Its your opinion and I wont disway you but Momochi has won majors with his Ken so if your going to say Chris Ken is better when Chris hasnt won nowhere as much as Momochis ken.   If your just looking at combos and spacing your not looking at the whole package. Decision making goes a long way and gimmicks after a while will only get you so far at high level play.  I understand you like the flashy gameplay man but after a while you're gonna see who is the smarter player.

StreetFighter,3e07hn,xamdou,0,Tue Jul 21 21:24:48 2015 UTC,Would this mean that pre-orders before the psn update would still have access to the beta?

StreetFighter,3dyclq,Lukeweizer,22,Mon Jul 20 15:15:41 2015 UTC,I don't think I can watch this again.  I had a hard time sleeping last night.  Gamerbee is my new favorite though... makes me want to pick up adon.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Wal_Mart,4,Mon Jul 20 16:17:42 2015 UTC,After hearing he was about to retire/quit I want to support this guy too. Second place at the biggest fighting game tournament in the world is no small feat. I hope he knows this and continues on. Just love the fact that he was so disappointed in second place. Anyone one of us would have celebrated getting that far.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,FEDEX__vs__UPS,4,Mon Jul 20 22:32:23 2015 UTC,It's because he's been second for so long and he was so close to only fail
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Grixle,0,Tue Jul 21 00:09:19 2015 UTC,he got 2nd at evo 2012 lol
StreetFighter,3dyclq,PRRKRR,3,Tue Jul 21 03:03:46 2015 UTC,Gamerbee is the reason I picked up Adon years ago when he came in second to Infiltration. I started crying when they panned over to his girlfriend.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,thithiths,29,Tue Jul 21 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"Watching this for a second time... man.  At first I didn't get it.  Like, she goes up to him crying.   Thought it was really over the top.  But the reality is, no one wanted this ending.  Gamerbee didn't want to win like that, Momochi didn't want to win like that.  Forever people will ask:  Did that ruin Gamerbee's momentum?  If Momochi would've lost, would that have been the reason?  Also people will say this was an EVO thing.  It's not that at all. Gamerbee has put in so much work with Adon.  Momochi showed up this year big time and consistently impressed at tournaments.  If anything, this was in the making since before the last EVO.  All of that came to a single match.  Bracket reset, five figures on the line, 200,000 people watching.  All of that to be interrupted by a controller derp?  Man... Words can't begin to express how much sodium there is over this.  Watching this for a second time made me realize that.  And how big these competitors are.  Gamerbee constantly bowing and showing respect to the fans, the tournament, and what it stands for.  Neither of them are 100% happy.  Can't imagine having to deal with that.  :/"
StreetFighter,3dyclq,JediSange,21,Mon Jul 20 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Losers bracket final was the best SF4 I've ever seen and this final was on pace to cap off the best EVO yet. Then the controller disconnected and that was literally the worst possible thing that could have happened apart from something ridiculous like a fire.   Still a great grand finals but was just an awful thing to happen.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,lightning87,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:21 2015 UTC,And it's the swan song to SFIV. Maybe this was the best farewell for the game before SFV takes center stage.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,thederpmeister,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"Capcom Cup, my friend. We still have Capcom Cup to enjoy!"
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Beginning_End,14,Mon Jul 20 22:10:40 2015 UTC,Both players were put on tilt from the pause. I don't know why people claim Momochi benefited from the situation at all.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,skitzless,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of people don't understand how important momentum is. The two players were focused, in the zone, playing a long set, keeping information etc when suddenly they have to stop for a couple of minutes and take their minds off. No matter what, both of them are not on it when they're back, it's just a FT1round for glory (and a FT 1round against Evil Ryu with two meters as well lol)  The only sure thing is: Razer was the loser overall"
StreetFighter,3dyclq,zDamascus,2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:38 2015 UTC,I don't think most people are claiming he definitely did. They're saying that we can't know what would have happened and ultimately that is because of a problem created by Momochi.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Beginning_End,3,Mon Jul 20 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"It's a shitty situation but I would still say this was the best way of resolving the situation. If we restarted the final game and gamerbee took the first round but momochi won the last two, we would still have people asking, what if they gave gamerbee a round instead? Momochi had the momentum going into second round, he lost a round and had to play with an unfamiliar stick. IMO he was hurt by the situation more and if we had to have one winner I'd argue momochi deserved it more."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,skitzless,8,Tue Jul 21 01:34:39 2015 UTC,I think momochi should be happy and it's not right to take anything away from him because in the end he won.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,BK201G,4,Mon Jul 20 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"Nobody took out away from him. If he had popped off and acted like it was a clean win, that'd be fucked up. But he acknowledged 100% that in THE pinnacle event for his game, a controller malfunction after a bracket reset when your opponent has momentum is not ideal for anyone, winner or loser. He was a victim too. He will never know if gamerbee would have been able to complete the climb against him. He also lost something from that happening"
StreetFighter,3dyclq,SwoleFlex_MuscleNeck,3,Mon Jul 20 22:28:32 2015 UTC,It was messed up for both of them. Momochi was on match point when the pause came in. Have to remember that.   Would gamer bee gotten two stright rounds? Who knows but that would have been hype. Sucks that we don't get to know.  I don't think we should take away from Momochi.  He played out of his mind all weekend.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,grimey6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is taking away from him. He won fair and square. Even had a handicap of 1 round. He deserved it. I'm just saying, I know how I would feel. All that work, only to have it called into question who is truly the champ because of a random event fragmenting the timeline"

StreetFighter,3dyclq,grimey6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:04:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how Gamerbee supposedly had the momentum. They were trading games.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,SuperFirePanda,4,Tue Jul 21 05:00:26 2015 UTC,He was on a stretch and reset the bracket
StreetFighter,3dyclq,SwoleFlex_MuscleNeck,6,Tue Jul 21 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping gamerbee gets to face momochi at capcom cup, so we can have our answer.  Fuck they should do a salty suite match."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Vellon221,6,Mon Jul 20 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"If you ask me, because it was a controller malfunction rather than a pause they should have nulled the last game and had them restart from the beginning. Unfortunately, they have to go by the book."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Kamaria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:22 2015 UTC,No one saying that the controller disconnected again after the first incident. That's why he asked for another controller and played that final round on someone's else's controller.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,FEDEX__vs__UPS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"It shows up on the screen right when the pause happens: ""Please reconnect your controller"" so it was definitely a malfunction.  Nulling the last game would've been unfair too, though. Momochi was already up a round."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Decency,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:04:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, the totally honest way to look at it is; A player is responsible for bringing his own working equipment.   Not that this would be a likely thing to occur, but if they nullified the round, what would stop someone from finding a way to rig their stick to malfunction if they didn't like the way things are going? It's a hypothetical, but then again, who would have predicted what happened last night?"
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Beginning_End,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"they wouldn't even have to rig their stick, the rules say an ""accidental pause"" gives the other player the round.  If those were the rules, they could just pause it whenever."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Wal_Mart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:26 2015 UTC,Yeah you can tell Monochi isn't super pumped with his win.  He deserved it but yeah if that was me I'd be forever wondering what might have happened
StreetFighter,3dyclq,madr0x,-6,Tue Jul 21 06:07:37 2015 UTC,I think you're injecting more drama into it than is necessary.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,fuzeebear,8,Mon Jul 20 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"Totally valid, haha. It's just there is a lot of emotion there is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm romanticizing it a bit, but it remains that I couldn't imagine being so big about that happening. Mad respect to them."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,JediSange,13,Mon Jul 20 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. Easily the greatest EVO finals since EVO was founded, might be the greatest FGC spectacle since Moment 37. Just an insane roller coaster of emotion, full of creative, desperate, furious gameplay from weary, hungry legends. Ai Ai looking like he wandered into winners bracket by mistake, and then putting on an absolute Juri clinic on Nemo. Nemo flipping it around and exploiting character unfamiliarity with his Rolento. PR Rog's heartbreaking exit. Infiltration showing the entire FGC exactly why he's the smartest player in the game, with just an incomprehensibly deep stable of character knowledge. But all of that was nothing compared to Gamerbee's gauntlet.   Until last night, I'd always considered Gamerbee to be kinda like Bonchan, always a bridesmaid, never the bride. Consistent Top 8 finisher, but always seemed to get knocked out by the really nasty glass cannon monsters. His character picks were boring too: neither Adon nor Elena are flashy characters, just characters with very strong fundamentals. Yawn. But dear lord...his performance last night was like watching like some sort of real-life FGC version of Rocky. His fight with Infil was like two crazed men trying to drown each other in a shallow pool, just a vicious war of attrition that put on full display the lengths each of these champions were willing to go to for victory. After barely scraping out one of the most brilliant time scams ive ever seen, he resets the bracket against the golden boy Momochi, and just as it looks like its going to be another legendary final round...the controller disconnect. It was very unfortunate, but like the blackout during the 2013 Superbowl, it changed the momentum and added another bizarre twist to a story that is already becoming legend. It was as if the clash between these two gods had broken the game itself; neither would give an inch, so the game just quit. That to me was the real end of the tournament. The last round was a formality. That's why I don't feel sad, although I did feel overwhelmingly emotional at the conclusion. It wasn't sad because Gamerbee lost, or that the controller disconnect put an asterisk next to Momochi's W, it was instead the most raw, most honest, most unflinching display of sportsmanship and humanity I've ever seen in a competitive environment.   The most famous play in soccer history is Diego Maradona's Hand of God. It was a goal scored off of an illegal handball, but it's still remembered as the greatest moment. Just because a technicality undermines the victory doesn't take away from the purity of the passion, the idea that the moment represents.  Last night was the FGC community's Hand of God moment. I dare anyone to watch Gamerbee run the gauntlet against Infiltration and Momochi and tell me that e-sports aren't legitimate, that these players are less competitors than professional athletes, that these guys aren't emptying their hearts into these games. An utterly insane, complicated, and thoroughly brilliant Top 8."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Affairs_Of_The_Butt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"This is the best of words.  It was a brilliant display. That top 8 was just out of this world in drama, suspense, and intrigue.  You name it, and it was there.  It was full of emotion and everyone was exhausted afterwards, from the players to commentators to Twitch viewers.  The violence on screen displayed the action, but we all felt it.  Best Evo ever."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,banditcom,4,Mon Jul 20 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"I really disagree.  This game is these players lives.  They're paid to play this game.  They're shipped across the entire world, enduring tons of 10+ hour flights, to play in tournaments.  EVO is arguably (alongside Capcom Cup) the biggest one, the one that they both want to win the most.  This is the last year that SFIV is going to be the main game and it was basically the worst outcome possible.  They will both forever wonder what would've happened had the controller not malfunctioned.  Momochi won't feel satisfied winning and Gamerbee will just feel cheated.  As a spectator who maybe plays casually, yeah..  You might wonder what the big deal was.  But if you're actually the one playing and devoting your life to playing it (maybe even dealing with questions of the future of their gaming careers with SFV on the way), then yeah..  To them it was a really shitty and dramatic outcome."

I don't know if that's what it was but from the sound of it the controller was showing disconnected from the xbox, which sounds like a short."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,mr_sneakyTV,4,Mon Jul 20 21:07:03 2015 UTC,I'm assuming a loose connection. They plugged it back in and it worked for a bit and then disconnected again. That's when they realized something was truly wrong and they had to get a new stick.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Beginning_End,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:48 2015 UTC,This. No one is mentioning that it happened twice.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,FEDEX__vs__UPS,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:51:13 2015 UTC,i could have sworn that his stick stopped responding so he yanked the cord to pause the game. or at least thats what i heard

StreetFighter,3dyclq,jaur,3,Mon Jul 20 23:37:47 2015 UTC,Razer was great when I contacted them about sending me a new cable too... thankfully when I asked they did have one. I do wish it wasn't a proprietary one... After I dual mod mine for ps4 I'm thinking about changing it out for a Neutrik.

StreetFighter,3dyclq,bokchoykn,3,Tue Jul 21 11:04:49 2015 UTC,"I wish they just restarted Game #5.  A pause/controller disconnect is supposed to be a round loss. Momochi was already up a round, so the restart would have negated the round win. It's still fair to Gamerbee.  It would have been a better outcome for the situation. It would also allow Momochi to button check his replacement joystick.  Also, LOL Razer joysticks."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,awesomonewb,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:08 2015 UTC,They didn't restart because of meter gain most likely

StreetFighter,3dyclq,imnotroll,0,Mon Jul 20 22:28:29 2015 UTC,Screw Momochi. Gamerbee or Inflitration shoulda been champ.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Groundchuck101,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:31 2015 UTC,It's because Gamerbee is in DA SPLIT! He was super WASHED.
StreetFighter,3dyclq,dashrandom,-5,Tue Jul 21 01:09:49 2015 UTC,"As a cody main, I can only feel that gamerbee is the true winner.   Momochi sold out imo. He went for a counterpick that he wasn't even familiar with playing. He had Akuma and cody, both characters that do fairly well against adon and he sold out and went with e ryu.  I don't know if anyone realises but gamerbee is more comfortable with the e Ryu matchup on Elena than on adon (against daigo for example). But he chose to stick to adon because it was obvious that Momochi's e ryu wasn't up to par.  I can't look up to Momochi the same way any more for picking e ryu... That was just pure desperation and a loss of confidence in his own ability to win the matchup.  Edit: Look you're entitled to your own opinion. I'm not saying momochi isn't a fantastic player or that he didn't deserve the victory, I feel that he cracked mentally and basically tiered whored, hoped for the best and got lucky. He had Akuma which gamerbee hates playing with adon and he had cody which does pretty well against adon. Gamerbee has defeated much better e ryu's with Elena, and yet he still chose to play adon in that match up. That makes zero sense. You are entitled to think what you want just as I am. I feel that gamerbee won the mental battle completely even though he lost the game."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,SuperFirePanda,5,Tue Jul 21 03:06:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see the problem with him picking E.Ryu. Gamerbee counter picks Elena. and Infiltration played like 4 characters. As for not being familiar, he did win after all."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,CaptainNeuro,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:11 2015 UTC,"And yet he won.   If you're at EVO you're there to compete. If you're on main stage of all places you're there to fucking WIN at all costs. The objective of Street Fighter isn't to look the smoothest or the flashiest. It's to deplete the other fucker's life bar by any means necessary. He clearly felt comfortable enough with E.Ryu in that matchup to pick the character, and came out on top.   There is no 'selling out' even possible here. He made a call and it paid off. That is the only thing that matters. There are only decisions that work out and those that don't. If the only reason Gamerbee lost was due to not switching because 'it was obvious that Momochi's e ryu wasn't up to par' then frankly, he's a fucking idiot for letting overconfidence get the better of him.  However, I very much doubt that's the case. He played a monster of a tournament and nobody can take that from him."

If he didn't choose how most optimal character for a matchup, he fucked up. Simple as.   As for 'tier whoring', that's cute. Tier whoring does not exist. The roster is nothing more than a toolbox, and Momochi picked a tool that got results. He's not as known for his e.Ryu, you're right, but picking him despite that is a powerful mental weapon in and of itself.  The nice thing about fighting games is that they're objective and always show what's needed. The player who played best in a given situation at a given moment is easy to tell. They're ALWAYS the one with life still in the bar at the end."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,dashrandom,0,Tue Jul 21 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"This is the last time I'm going to try and explain what I'm trying to get across. I don't think I'm going to try to explain my point any further because it seems no one here is even trying to understand.  I play fighting games as well. I know the person who wins is indisputably the champion. But momochi played a terrible e ryu. He dropped combos, missed hit confirms, walked into st hks, didn't know any okizeme set ups; he was basically learning the match up on the fly (props to him I guess?). He took a huge gamble with the e ryu pick when he could have gone for a safe pick with Akuma or Cody instead. Sure, he's the winner this time. Props to him. But what if he lost with his gamble? Is it fine to call him a fucking scrub for making a completely unsafe pick when he had safer, more familiar options? Not only that, he went for the e ryu pick with full knowledge that Gamerbee had a counterpick for it. That's the dumbest thing he could have done; from a matchup knowledge standpoint, he failed entirely. The only reason I can think of for him making the e ryu pick is pure unadulterated desperation. I could even argue the pause gave him time to go over the matchup in his head and learn what he needed to do to win, but there's no point going into that, it's been discussed extensively already elsewhere that it could have swung either wait (although some people on this sub hold very strong opinions about who it benefitted).  I'm not sure why Gamerbee didn't switch to Elena. It seems there's something he knew about momochi that made him choose not to switch, I'm not an adon player so I can't comment on this very well, but I can quote an example with cody. The cody sgat match up is pretty much 7-3 in Sagat's favour but if  and only if Sagat can kara special (kara uppercut and fireball). If he can't, then the matchup is actually in Cody's favour, maybe about 6-4. If I play against an opponent and realise he is unable of kara cancelling into specials, I'll stick with my cody pick. There is a possibility that Gamerbee noticed something that we didn't and thus stuck to adon.  Last but not least, as a Cody player who looks up to momochi, it was disheartening to see him crack at the last minute and decide to pick something he's never played competitively. Even If he went with Akuma, I wouldn't be disappointed with him. At the very least Infil has played all his characters competitively before, and wasn't doing things out of desperation, those were true counterpicks. I hope this clarifies my position a little. If you still think I'm wrong, you're welcome to think whatever you want."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,CaptainNeuro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"The play wasn't perfect, you're right. But neither was Gamerbee's. Dropped combos happen. All the time. At every level. If anything, it's a good thing. It's a reminder that the two players who are indisputably the best two players in the world right now are human. If you're not going to be affected somehow by being the last two people on the EVO main stage, you have no soul, and some of that will inevitably carry over to your game.   Drops happen, but more importantly is the recovery from those drops when they do.  As for knowledge? They were inside each other's heads, that was obvious. It seems to me that Momochi wanted to throw a curveball into things, and it worked. Again, his play wasn't perfect, but 'good enough' is...Well...Good enough! I'm sure he had a logical reason for doing it. It's Momochi. Both he and Gamerbee are going to take a lot from those games, but personally?   I'm looking forward to and can't wait to see the fallout when they next play. That will be something that can't be missed."
StreetFighter,3dyclq,Mekhami,-25,Tue Jul 21 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but I wasn't that impressed with Gamerbee's Adon, and I wasn't that impressed with his Elena either, but acknowledge that his Elena took some skill.  His Adon though? I went back and counted his button presses and literally 64% of the actions that he took was stand roundhouse.   Let that soak in for a minute.  He pressed Stand Roundhouse more times than every other button or move combined.  Auto footsies, breaks focus, insane reach, that was not a very skillful match. There was no high level play here. He pressed stand roundhouse, and did extremely basic confirms.  Whatever, I'll pass on watching that again."

So now he thinks to throw fireballs. Bee started churning ex jaguar kick and conditioned Momochi that he could react to fireballs with this.  Momo ended up turning up the speed of the game and just trying to get more c.mk for high damage. Because this was his only opportunity at Big damage Bee's best response was hard kick as it outranged.   Of course you'd have to had actually played Street fighter at a level to understand the conditioning and mind games that are going on. When you spectate SF and you hear the commentators say something is smart if you can explain why then you'll usually see it's because it's a hard read or a response to conditioning. I feel you haven't even begun to see the mind games, and you're purely looking at the mechanical difficulty of particular actions  Yes it just seemed like all he was using was one button, but if you can't appreciate how he was making it work so consistently against the strongest player this year then you need to get more experience playing the game not just watching it."
StreetFighter,3e2qx7,Too_Much_Sweg,3,Tue Jul 21 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"I've made the opposite transition in the past and there are a few things that i think you could help me with before i give you any advice.   Do you play on pad or stick? Are you familiar with the basic command motions? e.g. Hadouken, Shinku Hadouken, Shoryuken, Tatsumaki? What character you plan on picking up?"
StreetFighter,3e2qx7,ZeonHUEHUE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"1) I play on a stick  2) Yes, I am confident when it comes to executing the basic commands. But, the habit of crouch blocking makes the inputs seem harder, like if i were to be standing or if i was in a crouch forward position it would make Tatsumaki or shoryuken easier to do.  Should I be holding down forward/neutral stand/down more when attacking? would that make doing my combos easier?  3) I plan on playing Ryu. I always felt like Ryu was someone everyone should learn, helps with footsies and fundamentals.  Thank you for the help!  EDIT: wording"
StreetFighter,3e2qx7,ZeonHUEHUE,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"I get what you say by the inputs feeling harder to do when crouch blocking.  There are 2 things that you should try to your gameplay that in my opinion will make your life a bit easier.   Imagine a particular situation and try to mimic it in training mode. e.g. (walking forward, c.mk + fireball) You will very likely get DP instead of fireball sometimes due to how the inputs work, wich i think will help you understand that there's a particular timing for you to switch inputs without getting the buffering for DP.   This apply for a lot of situations that you can easily mimic in the training.    Reactions are needed in a lot of situations, but more in a few than in others. Imagine how important is for you to know how to react a tiger shot mid screen with your ultra and how important it is to react to DP a Adon Jaguar Kick at the right time.   Try focusing on the ones that matter the most and that can give you a bigger lead/advantage first, and then focus on the small details later.  Hope i made it clear for you, english is not my main language so.. sorry about any mistakes."

I imagine Qanba/Eightarc will have a PS4 stick out by then.  For currently available PS4 native sticks, you're really just looking at either Hori Rap4($150) or Madcatz TE2($200)."

StreetFighter,3e0kfr,Reth_R,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"Yes there is a difference, if you're going to play on PC, you're going to want the ps4 stick.  The xbox one drivers still don't recognize the trigger buttons on the xbox version of the te2, so you're playing without two buttons.  It's no big deal, but if you're only playing on pc, no reason not to get the ps4 version.  Also, the ps4 version will be playable if you ever decide to check out a local tournament or something when sfv comes out."

Then I'll probably open it up and pad hack my nice eightarc stick. Unless eightarc comes out with something I can't turn down.  So in conclusion consider padhacking.

StreetFighter,3e0kfr,DaCush,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:13 2015 UTC,"I just bought a ps360+ pcb the other day. It's $60 and it's compatible with basically every console with fighters on it, even old stuff like the saturn and nes. But I mainly got it for the ps4 compatibility that comes by updating the firmware to version 1.6 and later.  The only downside is that since it isn't an official ps4 stick pcb so there's an 8 minute time out where the stick won't work after 8 minutes of use. Theres an easy work around however where you can hold down the select and R2 button to disconnect it and reconnect with the ps4 by pressing the home button. Takes like 3 seconds and I figure you can just do it in between matches so its really no problem. Eventually it might get true ps4 compatibility without the 8 minute timeout as the firmware gets updated but for now its probably one of the best values if you got a case to hold it in. A pcb with ps3/360/ps4 and a shit ton more older consoles with it? One of the best option imo"
StreetFighter,3e0kfr,ExNami,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"Unless they release a bluetooth addon board it's not possible to fix the eight minute timeout on PS4.  If you're buying a stick/brain explicitly for PS4 I seriously doubt you'd want to tolerate having to remember to disconnect/reconnect your stick in between every other match.  That'd get really old, really quick."
StreetFighter,3e0kfr,code_nomad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:21 2015 UTC,No you dont have to disconnect and reconnect your stick. You just have to press select and R2 at the same time and then press the home button to reset your stick with with the ps4. A minor inconvenience really
StreetFighter,3e0kfr,ExNami,3,Tue Jul 21 05:45:05 2015 UTC,"But do you really want to pay upwards of $60, along with the time and effort to retrofit a current stick, to have to do that?  If you're desperate for a PS4 solution it's viable I guess.  Personally I just hope that SF5 adopts the PS3 driver so we don't have to deal with this.  It'd make things so much easier for everyone."

StreetFighter,3e0kfr,Kugruk,0,Tue Jul 21 04:09:53 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat kinda. I have a Madcatz original TE that I used for Xbox 360. I love that stick.   Then I bought a Ps4. Didn't even know back then that SFV would be a Sony exclusive. Got lucky there. So I'll need a new stick before it comes out. I'm leaning towards the USFIV TE 2. However there's no touchpad control on it which might or might not make some sort of difference on SFV.   I'm guessing in the next 8 months Madcatz will come out with a more Ps4 focused stick.

Don't quote me on that but it's very unlikely that they wouldn't give the code out. Some people on this post recently pre-ordered the PS4 version and got codes so I am guessing PC will be the same."

Edit: There is also a global leaderboard in sf4 if that's what you're talking about when you say ladder... Ranks based on PP.

There is actually a tournament mode in sf4, the problem is you can't set it to bo3 or whatever and it is very barebones.

StreetFighter,3e2a6g,JoshSo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:13 2015 UTC,net-player   Do you mean this wouldn't work offline? Why?
StreetFighter,3e2a6g,chickensandwichesare,8,Tue Jul 21 12:29:39 2015 UTC,Because it's gimmicky and accounting for how she reacted to the tatsu she would have caught your landing frames offline and actually landed the cr HP like she wanted.
StreetFighter,3e2a6g,Kalulosu,2,Tue Jul 21 12:36:20 2015 UTC,"Well, this DP doesn't kill on chip in this situation, does it? If not, then you're at risk of being blocked, as JoshSo said. This DP you did is a ""50/50"" where you bet that she tried to punish for some reason. If you wanted to do that safely, you could've kept the meter, used a tatsu immediately after Ultra to get close (Daigo did this all the time with Ryu), and you'd have had 2 EX bars to cancel a DP. There's no ""right or wrong"", you won this game so it worked. If Chun had blocked, you'd have lost and it wouldn't have worked."
StreetFighter,3e2a6g,Nybear21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"I would think Chun's Ultra would catch Tatsu, but I'm not positive of that."

StreetFighter,3e2a6g,Metalman1988,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely a 50/50 when throwing out DPs like that.  Chun Li did something.  I couldn't even tell.  Assuming is was a low mp.  That was a full hit.  Unsafe move but, sometimes greater risks lead to greater rewards."

It completely put both players on tilt, you can't help but wonder what would happen if everything went normally.  Congrats to Momochi, though.  Playing so hard HE BROKE HIS FUCKING CONTROLLER.  Also, all of the props to Gamerbee for doing the right thing and not taking the game."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Slyguy46,39,Mon Jul 20 04:43:56 2015 UTC,Momochi must have felt so bad at that moment.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,cryslo,25,Mon Jul 20 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yah, Momo wasn't too happy to win like that, nobody can expect failed stick at such moment... This is the most dramatic and intense EVO final for Street Fighter IV  in my opinion."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Quasimodox,3,Mon Jul 20 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why he would be disappointed at that.  He didn't get any free rounds, and he was also up 1 round before the delay.  Momochi won 2 rounds fair and square.  Heck, if Gamerbee would have won, that would of felt tainted."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,parkwayy,3,Mon Jul 20 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Everything was fucked after that point. If gamer bee did win, you would definitely hear some rhetoric about how he only won because he got a round from momochi for a stick malfunction, and everyone would be hugging momochi... Which is garbage IMO gamerbee came back from losers so there's no saying he won unfairly.  It's just a fucked situation for both and I mean someone had to win and lose...   On the ""positive"" side of things (if there is one in this situation?) it created so much tension and drama for the fans and the community.  Not the best way to end the last usf4 evo tournament, but an interesting one at least. I enjoyed the hell out of it!"

StreetFighter,3dwt54,Quasimodox,30,Mon Jul 20 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive he can only take the round, not the game in that situation.  Which is why he punched Momo twice so he had the life lead and then let the timer count down instead of running a combo on him."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Mirage84,2,Mon Jul 20 04:46:43 2015 UTC,"gamerbee shoulda just punched him all the way until he died. the fact that he was honorable enough to do it only twice, and STILL GET BOO'D AT, makes me so incredibly angry."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Kaoculus,29,Mon Jul 20 05:04:57 2015 UTC,The reason he only punched him twice was to avoid building ex. That way the next fight would be fair. I think it still was Gamerbees' choice how to win the fight though.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,smellerbees,3,Mon Jul 20 05:10:58 2015 UTC,"i understand that, but everytime that this has happened in the past, they always kill to the very end and build meter anyway. this is a stretch, but ricky is actually infamous for whiffing specials and building meter in a similar situation as well. i'm not saying gamerbee should have done something like that, but he was in such a bad position where if he punched someone to death, he was going to get boo'd. the refs shoulda stepped in and made killing him mandatory."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Kaoculus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:24:00 2015 UTC,Fairly certain a timeout has happened every time I've seen such a thing on stream.

StreetFighter,3dwt54,Quasimodox,3,Mon Jul 20 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they boo'd because they they they would continue round 2 with similar health, and not Bee getting the round"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,RizenDeath,4,Mon Jul 20 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"did you mean that the crowd thought that they would continue it? it's clearly written in the evo rules (as well as any tourney rules) that a pause equates to an instant round loss, and should be taken by killing the enemy. they boo'd because they wanted gamerbee to somehow circumvent the rules and play. it was just a lose lose situation anyway."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Kaoculus,19,Mon Jul 20 05:26:00 2015 UTC,Not even the players knew what they were supposed to do in that situation. I'm not surprised the audience was confused as well. Although I agree that they should not have booed.

Gamerbee has gotten 2nd place at SF4 series twice now: 2012 and now 2015. 2nd time ever at EVO for the SF4 series that the bracket has reset in Grand Finals. Infiltration used 8 different characters in this year's Ultra tourney: Juri, Chun Li, Evil Ryu, Akuma, Elena, Decapre, Ryu and Abel. Momochi has now beaten Infiltration 3-2 in their last 3 encounters at 3 different tournaments: Stunfest, South East Asia Major and now EVO.

Infiltration has now been in Top 8 four times for SF4 series: 2010, 2012, 2013, and now 2015. PR Balrog has now been in Top 8 four times for SF4 series: 2009, 2012, 2013 and now 2015.

The hype just builds and builds, as there's literally less than 10-20 seconds of downtime between fights. SC2 also has built-in downtime at the start of each match, as economies come into play, but SF4 is action from the word go. Also, the crowd being so close to the players in a smaller room (usually a convention room rather than a stadium or theatre) means that things get loud, rowdy, and so exciting."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Xciv,66,Mon Jul 20 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"Fucking awesome final. Congrats to Momochi but man feel so bad for Gamerbee. He went through Daigo, Tokido, Infiltration, Nemo and Momochi, jesus christ.   Amazing overall, bit anti climatic end but the overall top 8 was just amazing."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,sangreal-back,27,Mon Jul 20 04:45:16 2015 UTC,"Not to mention how close Gamerbee was in the previous EVO as well. He basically started the Adon trend, best Adon in the world."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Quasimodox,15,Mon Jul 20 05:00:56 2015 UTC,"And last year's Dreamhack Winter where he barley lost to Fuudo and missed Capcom Cup final. He seemed to have been depressed at that time contemplating retiring so I really wanted him to do well since then  And seeing him get this far man and lose, I almost shed a tear."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,sangreal-back,8,Mon Jul 20 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"Yah, he came sooooo close. Crowd was cheering for him, he is the people's champ."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Quasimodox,8,Mon Jul 20 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"He went through Daigo, Tokido, Infiltration, Nemo and Momochi   That is amazing."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,yensama,2,Mon Jul 20 06:13:24 2015 UTC,How was it anti climactic? He got a reset. It went to game 5. Round 2 was a wash but it was literally the tightest fights in all of EVO.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,atriax,30,Mon Jul 20 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"bit anti climatic because of the stick problem.  And I said a bit, overall it was intense as hell but that stick problem disrupt the flow a bit."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,sangreal-back,41,Mon Jul 20 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"Wow... at the end... James crying, the ""You're all free now"" chant and everything.  What an amazing tournament this was. Even tho' i suck ass at SF (I'm better at MK, don't judge me, SF is hard.) it definitely brings the crowds and is amazing to watch at a pro level.  GG Evo, GG SF4. Too bad we wait another year for it to happen again."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,ginfish,3,Mon Jul 20 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"Where can I see the ""You're all free"" chant?  Didn't see it on the VoD and youtube gives me nothing"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Coffera,8,Mon Jul 20 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"its at the very last 10 seconds of the vod, whole crowd goes wild  EDIT: Here"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,GManSta,5,Mon Jul 20 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, thanks for that.   Sent shivers down my spine"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Coffera,2,Mon Jul 20 14:01:52 2015 UTC,It's literally the last 5 seconds of the whole broadcast. Don't know if they cut before that happened.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,ginfish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"That riki-oh clip, too good."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,parkwayy,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"Man I've been watching Evo since 2009. To see the tournament and the community and the game itself come so far is so amazing. The crowd ""You are all free now"" legitimately brought a tear to my eye. In a way it was so beautiful. Just shows how big a group we've become and how many people love the community."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Smilotron,20,Mon Jul 20 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Can someone please explain to me why Gamerbee was such a huge fan favorite? I know the casters said he was going to quit and went a long way to get to the finals (or something of that sort), what do they mean by he went a long way and is that the reason he was such a favorite or is there more?"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Kuriibohh,67,Mon Jul 20 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"He started his Evo career piloting an under-represented and seemingly underpowered character in Adon to multiple top finishes, but never won, and then threatened to retire some time ago I think. This Evo, he arguably had the toughest gauntlet of matchups player-wise to run through (Justin Wong, Daigo, Takido, Infiltration, etc.) especially in the top 8. He actually got through it all and made it to Grand Finals after one of the longest, most physically exhausting sets in SF4 history probably against Infiltration in Losers Finals and then took it to the last round of the last game against Momochi in Grand Finals. You HAVE to respect that."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,spinfinity,7,Mon Jul 20 05:01:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see wow that's super fucking impressive. Yeah, I just bought the game recently during the steam summer sale and barely started watching the competitive scene due to EVO. I only tuned in to the finals and heard everyone loving Gamerbee so now it all makes sense. Thanks a lot for the explanation!"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Kuriibohh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:32:59 2015 UTC,Not a problem! He's one of my favorite players haha.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,spinfinity,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:20 2015 UTC,Is the video of him playing vs Justin Wong this Evo up anywhere?
StreetFighter,3dwt54,forbiddenone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure, I only heard about it myself. I could actually be wrong about Gamerbee facing him lol."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,spinfinity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"This. And a lot of people know how much gamerbee wanted to win.. He works so damned hard and never quite makes it all the way.  Momochi wanted it bad too (both players haven't won an evo), but momochi is already a capcom cup champion.    The last hurrah would definitely be a runback at capcom cup this year and gamerbee take it all... As he did qualify from this tournament.  USF4 AINT DEAD YET."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,avid9736,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, I have faith in Gamerbee. I'm sad that I stopped playing this awesome game a while ago, but I'll be all up on the SF5 train!"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,spinfinity,29,Mon Jul 20 22:52:10 2015 UTC,He basically played every single match you could possibly play in order to get to the top and even took it to the last round of grand finals because he fought his way out of losers bracket. He also happens to be a favorite player of mine because he basically wrote the book on Adon.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,boochenhiem,30,Mon Jul 20 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"Always in top 8 but never a champion. That aside, he beat 4 of the top players (like, the consistently best SF players) on his way to the final. Daigo, Tokido, Nemo, Infiltration.  He fought harder than anyone I've ever seen."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,14Deadsouls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:01:01 2015 UTC,3 of 5 2d japanese gods :P
StreetFighter,3dwt54,parkwayy,15,Mon Jul 20 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"When Bee first appeared in the scene Adon was considered a trash tier character, and he started placing high/winning events with him.  He's also a very humble guy.  There's a vid of Jwong saying Adon is trash, it got posted a lot when bee showed up"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Holdingdownback,3,Mon Jul 20 05:04:18 2015 UTC,link to vid? The one I'm looking at doesn't seem to match up to your statement. ?

StreetFighter,3dwt54,iPlayRealDotA,2,Mon Jul 20 06:14:22 2015 UTC,maybe this one?
StreetFighter,3dwt54,komodo_dragonzord,10,Mon Jul 20 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"He's very hard working and came second in many occasions. Then last year, after failing to qualify to Capcom Cup, he said he was putting too much pressure on himself and had to remind himself that he plays this game cause he likes it and it's fun, that's something every single fan of SF can relate to."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,themadridi,9,Mon Jul 20 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"Hes been on somewhat of a slump last year, Everyone knows hes a fantastic player and a really nice guy, but has not had the best luck in terms of opponents.  Basically he went from thinking about retirement to making it 2nd place at EVO. With that spirit he has, its hard not to cheer for him to make it all the way."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,torke191,6,Mon Jul 20 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"Part of it is, he ground it out so hard on the tournament road last year to try to make it into Capcom Cup and juuust missed getting in. It was obviously a huge blow for him to not make it after working so hard, which I think is where most of the retirement talk came from.  Heartbreaking way to lose just now, but happy to see that he qualified for Capcom Cup this year."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,r_kive,5,Mon Jul 20 05:05:52 2015 UTC,"He's been in top 8 twenty times and was long over due for an evo victory, and to go out like this is a heart breaker"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,BeenWildin,4,Mon Jul 20 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"We saw him move through loser's bracket, through so many top-class players like Daigo, Tokido, and Infiltration. He's a player known for his second placings, and for him to finally cross that hurdle and get first place would have been amazing. He was the underdog, and we got to follow him his whole way up. People have been following him for years. Out of the 7 years of SF4 at Evo, he's had 4 top 8 placings, the same as PR Balrog. When you see them get close so many times, you want them to win."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,donkeybrains211,3,Mon Jul 20 05:08:47 2015 UTC,"To add to what the others said, he does well at basically every tournament, but wins rarely and looks heartbroken about it a lot. It would have been nice to see him finally win evo.  And speaking of heartbreaking ways to lose..."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,TomHD,19,Mon Jul 20 05:10:07 2015 UTC,This EVO has been absolutely crazy. That ending was insane. Kudos to everyone who made it so far!  EDIT: JAMES WE LOVE YOU!
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Auriora,7,Mon Jul 20 04:44:48 2015 UTC,Why was he crying? Didn't catch any of the stream and turned it on to see him bawling
StreetFighter,3dwt54,precise115,30,Mon Jul 20 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"like James said, it's kinda cliche now that they are always crying when EVO ends. It's just the fact they are so passionate about this game and the scene that they love man. These older guys have been around since the very START of streetfighter. They were there when evo was just 20 dudes in some garage and now we have a 2,200 man SF tourney with thousands of viewers in the audience and 250k people watching online. I can't even begin to understand what he's feeling, mix of pride and happiness I guess to be around thousands of people who share your passion."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,komodo_dragonzord,18,Mon Jul 20 06:18:45 2015 UTC,As a person who has never watched professional street fighter. That ending was one of the most intense stories I have ever witnessed. When James Chen cried. It was hard not to cry.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Silphex,10,Mon Jul 20 04:52:58 2015 UTC,"For all the grief people give Chen, he's one of the most passionate there is about the community, and he really can't be faulted for that."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,CaptainNeuro,36,Mon Jul 20 06:01:51 2015 UTC,At least Momochi has a new stick now.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,kungfukai,16,Mon Jul 20 04:57:47 2015 UTC,The way it ended was crazy.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,ItzaMeLuigi_,3,Mon Jul 20 04:42:52 2015 UTC,Understatement of the fucking century right here.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Chief_Economist,35,Mon Jul 20 05:32:41 2015 UTC,I hope the Golden Stick is not a Razer
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Khaaklol,29,Mon Jul 20 04:48:28 2015 UTC,It is in fact a MadCatz.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,djscrub,16,Mon Jul 20 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"Its a MCZ TE2, for those wondering"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,SSBM_Ogma,11,Mon Jul 20 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"Unrelated, but it was a bit ridiculous the Smash Melee players got the Golden Sticks. Are they going to plug that into their Gamecube?"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,LITERALLY_LMAO,27,Mon Jul 20 05:38:14 2015 UTC,Smash players got golden sticks they can't use.  Persona players did not get golden sticks at all.  Good job guys!

StreetFighter,3dwt54,Neighborhood_Wizard,77,Mon Jul 20 04:43:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty bad commercial for Razer. Replaced with a Mad Catz stick, then won."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Adossi,11,Mon Jul 20 04:45:25 2015 UTC,"Next streamed tournament event, Madcatz should have a commercial about it."

StreetFighter,3dwt54,SomeKindOfChief,5,Mon Jul 20 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. I wished I had known more about the technical side of the game while watching to be honest. I'm a DotA 2 player and hope the grand final of The International is at least half as exciting to watch as this final was. Especially after last years disappointment."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,LargeCoke,10,Mon Jul 20 05:23:37 2015 UTC,Why did gamerbee get a free round? What rule was broken?  First time I've watched street fighter. Intense games. Casters getting emotinal at the end. beautiful. i love evo
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Kosera,17,Mon Jul 20 04:51:51 2015 UTC,Momochi paused/had a controller malfunction during the round. Pausing during a round results in a judge's discretion as to whether your opponent takes the round or takes the game.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,SF218,14,Mon Jul 20 04:54:34 2015 UTC,The judge decides on whether a round should be taken. The game is only given if for some reason it can't be resumed from the moment it was paused.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,NShinryu,4,Mon Jul 20 05:34:02 2015 UTC,"the rule at evo is that if you pause, you lose the round. no decisions about it"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,hobdodgeries,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"There are some versions of the rules in the brackets with ""at the judge's discretion"" in them. If it's early on and the guys know it each other, they might let it rock.   The letter of the law is more strictly followed in high profile games."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,NShinryu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"Or if you can't get replacement equipment in a timely fashion (unlikely, there probably were 500 arcade sticks available for momochi at that time)."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,parkwayy,4,Mon Jul 20 19:02:19 2015 UTC,Pause from Momochi in the middle of the game due to a technical malfunction in his stick.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,spinfinity,5,Mon Jul 20 05:02:09 2015 UTC,"When equipment malfunctions, the person who needs new equipment loses that round."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,sonpansatan,4,Mon Jul 20 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"His controller disconnected and the game was paused because of it.  If a pause happens in the middle of a match, the person who didn't pause will get a free round or match."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,DaCush,10,Mon Jul 20 04:57:48 2015 UTC,First time watching Street Fighter and that was by far the hypest thing I've watched.  Had to come to the subreddit to see what else I missed out and am quite surprised how small the community is here considering it had over 230k viewers
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Bewake,13,Mon Jul 20 04:53:28 2015 UTC,I think /r/kappa has the majority of the community
StreetFighter,3dwt54,skitzless,6,Mon Jul 20 05:05:18 2015 UTC,"Well it's also because we moved from /r/sf4. When Street Fighter V comes out the subreddit will get bigger (and the in-game community, too)."

StreetFighter,3dwt54,NO3SCAPE,4,Mon Jul 20 04:58:57 2015 UTC,I'd confidently say this is the most hype top 8 ever for me.  Same level of hype as Latiff and Poongko in 2011. Good shit gentlemen!

Nothing too special.  2011 = Latif and Poongko make a mark and have hype matches  2012 = Infil steamrolled everyone. Nothing special.  2013 = Incredible top 8 and intense sets.  2014 = Ultra came out too close to EVO. Wasn't too hype.  2015 = Absolutely legendary"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,komodo_dragonzord,6,Mon Jul 20 05:31:48 2015 UTC,"2014 was pretty hype for me, never heard of Luffy and he was the first person to win evo from europe and from loser's side."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Azuvector,4,Mon Jul 20 06:24:45 2015 UTC,"2012 = Infil steamrolled everyone. Nothing special.   Infiltration was kinda new on the scene then. His owning Diago was hype as hell then. Go look at the 25th Anniversary set they did, and the match analysis videos that were made, and finally the FT10 he and Daigo did later on."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Beast_Pot_Pie,2,Mon Jul 20 09:02:12 2015 UTC,"Infil was not new by any means in 2012.  He even placed 3rd in 2009. 2010.  However, I do agree that his defeat of Daigo was hype."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,hobdodgeries,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:34 2015 UTC,2010 i think is when he placed 3rd

StreetFighter,3dwt54,skitzless,5,Mon Jul 20 17:56:46 2015 UTC,I think we avoided a riot with momochi winning
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Skylarowo,4,Mon Jul 20 05:04:15 2015 UTC,This weekend was my first time watching a Street fighter tournament.. And man did it deliver. Amazing Top 8.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,_Max0rz,5,Mon Jul 20 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"What really got me and potentially James as well was that on top of Gamerbee finishing second after such a grueling loser bracket, Momochi really felt so awful about not only defeating the crowd favorite but that the final game was tarnished by the unfortunate stick problem, regardless who would end up winning that match at that point cant help but feel like that finals didnt get the closure it deserved from 2 very dedicated players."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,Nybear21,4,Mon Jul 20 05:19:53 2015 UTC,I am hoping so bad that Capcom Cup comes down to Momochi and Gamerbee in the finals and they get a clean runback.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,parkwayy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:58 2015 UTC,"Still not sure why people think that win is tarnished.  Momochi didn't get a free round, he had one loss against him for a broken stick.  Momochi won 2 rounds, fully deserved."

StreetFighter,3dwt54,RS_Ramza,2,Mon Jul 20 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"I was rooting for Momochi from the get go, and I'm so glad he won. He has literally been the hardest working player this year bar none. Guy has been putting in serious work and he deserved it! The guy is amazing and so hype to watch, well done Momochi and big shoutouts to Infil and Gamerbee for some of the best SF I've ever seen in my 10+ years of playing!"
StreetFighter,3dwt54,shrapnade,5,Mon Jul 20 16:52:38 2015 UTC,Dude...Momochi is my favorite player who I was rooting for the whole tournament. But I wanted Gamerbee to win so bad after the gauntlet he ran through.    What a crazy finish. The crowd went from booing Gamerbee's tactics to chanting his name with the second place finish.
StreetFighter,3dwt54,hoojman,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"Anyone have a link to the rule book? If gamerbee could in fact have taken the entire game, then I am astounded and humbled at the same time. If it was just taking the round then I'm cool with it. Congrats to both of them. That was a grueling final.  Side note: this was my third year in a row watching EVO. I hope it keeps blowing up in popularity. SFV next year will be fucking sweet."
StreetFighter,3dwt54,komodo_dragonzord,4,Mon Jul 20 04:53:28 2015 UTC,SF4 would be following the Capcom pro tour rules and it says that the person who pauses would forfeit the round
StreetFighter,3dwt54,ZeroHasNoLimits,3,Mon Jul 20 06:26:47 2015 UTC,From http://evo.shoryuken.com/additional-rules/:   Accidentally pausing the game at any time during the fight may force you to forfeit the round (solely at a judge’s discretion).

StreetFighter,3dy9tp,Truen1ght,11,Mon Jul 20 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"So far, I haven't seen a video that explains how Juri's Ultra 1 (Feng Shui Engine) works. So I decided that, before I show some different ways and ranges to combo in FSE, I should show how the thing works.  There is an easter egg in there for some more advanced people...after thinking about it, you'll probably realize why I didn't explicitly say you could do this thing because it's really only usable in an offline scenario.  The end of the video has a little ""lets see this thing in action"" with some interesting combos that aren't just the standard one you see all the time on streams.  Hope you all like it! If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, please let me know. I'm not an expert on FSE, but I'm pretty confident I know a heck of a lot about it."

StreetFighter,3dy9tp,DesperateWhiteMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"I did not show video of it but I did test it before I took the video...it appeared to only work when you had the opponent in the corner. I did mention it as an option for a reset though, along with cl st hp. I'm not aware of any others at the moment, since the reset I know about requires putting the opponent into a juggle state."
StreetFighter,3dy9tp,DR_Hero,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:00 2015 UTC,Midscreen both store into  far st.mp or store into far st.mk both work on the entire cast. I usaully do it after close st.hk(1-hit) to confirm distance.   Bonus points for the reset is that you can immediately cancel into a fireball with the store you just used in the combo and get free dash in pressure.
StreetFighter,3e1hfi,wtbrian,10,Tue Jul 21 05:57:42 2015 UTC,Is this even a question? Bars don't convey the necessary information.

StreetFighter,3e1hfi,OldColt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:05 2015 UTC,"bars are absolutely terrible and useless. Need ping. Btw, I realize that fighting games (more so than other games) require a great netcode and no noticeable lag, but I was wondering if that meant we could only play in our regions? If I live in the EU, I can only play vs other EU players? Or would I also be able to play vs NA/JP people if I'd like to do that?  And I'm not just talking about the possibility of fighting against a friend who lives in another region (NA/JP for example... that should surely be possible, right?), but actually fighting against people from other regions in ranked. A global mode so to speak.  And I'm not just wondering about the PC(Steam)-version, but also the PS4-version of the game."

I'm cool with it only lasting a few months.  I just need it to feel good and be responsive so it doesn't turn him off of the game.  Once he's invested he'll spend money on something pricier."
StreetFighter,3e1d6b,Grixle,3,Tue Jul 21 07:56:27 2015 UTC,apparently it can die sooner than that. Why buy a garbage pad like that when you can buy a madcatz fightpad or something similar for about the same price

StreetFighter,3e1d6b,CeeDotGreen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:26:34 2015 UTC,the problem isn't why there isn't a decent pad. It's yoru friend is a cheap bugger who wants to pay for a piece of crap so it's what hes getting.
StreetFighter,3e1d6b,GoodTimesDadIsland,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:30:30 2015 UTC,"Would you rather pay $35 for a pad that's likely to break or $12 for a pad that's likely to break? Can't deny that a new, quality pad would be awesome!"
StreetFighter,3e1d6b,PriceZombie,2,Tue Jul 21 09:34:03 2015 UTC,If you're joining your local scene why buy a piece of shit controller because it'll die quicker. It's better you make a little investment to buy a nicer controller that will last longer so you won't have to buy another controller the moment yours dies (overall spending more money to buy 2 pads)
StreetFighter,3e1d6b,fuzeebear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:08:20 2015 UTC,I agree.  And I have several arcade sticks.  This is for a friend who doesn't want to spend money on a stick(yet) so he can play at home a little bit and come to some locals with a little bit of experience first.  He doesn't know if he likes Street Fighter yet(Evo piqued his interest) so he isn't willing to drop $50+ on a new controller. Yet.  And the 360 dpad is balls.
StreetFighter,3e1d6b,jcd1999,2,Tue Jul 21 09:24:46 2015 UTC,oh if hes got a 360 pad then he may as well use that. Smug uses a 360 pad and see how well he's doing
StreetFighter,3e3wdv,AshtonReeves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:16 2015 UTC,Are you too young or something to own a credit card? Just pre order on Amazon. I received my code in like 10 min through email. I just did that maybe 30 min ago. Amazon is also easy to cancel and they don't charge until the item is shipped.   So you could just do that...and then cancel. Free code. No need to ask anyone for it.

StreetFighter,3e0ae3,xTeriosx,4,Mon Jul 20 23:44:03 2015 UTC,I would imagine so. New games always attract views and Gootecks at least is pretty big on it being more third strikey. Unless there's scheduling conflicts it'd be pretty silly to miss the opportunity.   Thing with the all star episodes is they shot it in June(you can tell because Ricki said she was there for E3) so they sit on sessions for a while sometimes before editing and uploading. Even if they record stuff for the beta it might not be up til as late as September though I imagine it'd get priority over any other footage they have.
StreetFighter,3e0ae3,code_nomad,4,Tue Jul 21 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine they'd prioritize getting some videos up quick even if they aren't as high of production value as we're used to.  As soon as it's out people will be on youtube and twitch searching for videos of people playing it, and as you said it'd be silly to miss the chance to get those views."

His knowledge of every character doesn't just allow him to counter pick against characters, he counter picks against a player's play style. Amazing."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Sciar,4,Mon Jul 20 07:31:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I played against a lot of the guys in Korea and he's well known for sitting down and beating you 100 games straight with any character. He'll let you pick who you want to lose to and just destroy you.  Really cool guy with some incredible playing skill.

StreetFighter,3dwq78,Dog_Lawyer_DDS,15,Mon Jul 20 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"it was clearly a good strategy against Chun Li and you notice once Inf went Juri, Bee cut down big time on the backdash-heal in neutral due to Juri's better punishes  edit: Also after thinking on it, I want to take this opportunity to reiterate the definition of a scrub, as penned by David Sirlin: A scrub is someone who unironically believes in the concept of a cheap move. A scrub can be decent at the game, and a non-scrub can be garbage, but the aspect of scrubbery is when youre deluded enough to think cheap exists"
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Azuvector,2,Mon Jul 20 06:29:34 2015 UTC,"it was clearly a good strategy against Chun Li and you notice once Inf went Juri, Bee cut down big time on the backdash-heal in neutral due to Juri's better punishes   Yah, when I saw him pick Juri I was like, ""hmmm....oh! Yeah, he can totally punish Healing with Juri's divekick from full screen, or dash up super fast."""
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Quasimodox,6,Mon Jul 20 09:05:11 2015 UTC,"Some people may not fully understand the game.   Chun-Li has the advantage in the match up against Elena, but it is very clever how Gamerbee turned Infiltration's strategy around to his favor by utilizing the Healing.   Chun-Li has good pokes as well as fire balls for the strong ground game against Elena, Elena can't jump over fireballs as her floaty jump can easily be punished by Chun-Li. Chun-Li can play a keep away game safely and defensively by forcing Elena to chase her and slowly drain Elena's life away. However, Gamerbee healed cleverly, sometime interrupted the healing to get back in the game and avoid being punished, yet sometimes let the healing run to gain the maximum health back. Infiltration had to decide whether to chase Elena down during healing to punish her or watch out being reversal-attacked. It's very interesting how Infiltration's keep-away game being turned by Gamerbee and Chun-Li had to be forced to chase Elena instead.   Clever and well-executed game plans from both players, it just turned out to Gamerbee's favor in the end.  By the way, I had hard time sleeping last night after watching Gamerbee's heart-broken final... He lost, but he is the winner. (kinda like Rocky.)"
StreetFighter,3dwq78,bitchesandsake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"I have heard a lot that Chun is some Elena counter-pick, but I don't know that I believe it.  Yeah she has great pokes.  Elena has some solid pokes herself.  She can't (always) jump fireballs but she can slide them from the right range, or EX rhino or Mallet over them, and she has a lot more tools (and a ton more damage) than Chun, PLUS the high/low mixups and healing.  Chun's fireballs aren't good enough to pose any real problems and her AA game is pretty weak if you know where to jump from."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Quasimodox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"By the time you see Chun-Li's fireball comes out, it's already too late for Elena to jump, because Chun-Li can easily anti-air Elena. Elena's floaty jump is just too slow and makes her vulnerable in air. Elena's slide has to be at a certain range to be relatively safe, or she will be punished for it.   Chun-Li's ground game is on par with Elena, but having fireball gives Chun-Li the edge to pressure Elena and force Elena to chase Chun-Li down. Then again, it's all about the players, USF4 is fairly balanced in my opinion."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Beginning_End,12,Mon Jul 20 19:54:46 2015 UTC,I saw people talking shit on him... Fucking morons.   How do you talk shit on a person for using their character's ultra ability!?
StreetFighter,3dwq78,MrFTW,-6,Mon Jul 20 07:33:34 2015 UTC,"It's not always about how ""cheap"" something is, it's also about entertainment value. Watching Elena focus backdash Ultra was boring to watch, even if it worked."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,blaintopel,6,Mon Jul 20 17:27:09 2015 UTC,"First of all: i didnt think it was boring at all, and second of all, gamerbee doesn't owe you anything. He was trying to win. By your logic we should ban Fuudo from tournaments."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,MrFTW,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:07 2015 UTC,Why are you coming down on me so harshly? I was trying to show why some people weren't happy with Gamerbee's performance. A sentiment I agreed with on a level.   Bruce was smart for playing the way he did. It took a truck load of patience and intelligence to execute that game plan. I cannot fault him for playing like that.   Regardless I found it boring to watch. The momentum of intense footsie battles in the winners bracket and stunfest loser's bracket was a blast to watch. The sheer contrast of gameplay was too much to keep me interested. I almost slept through grand finals.
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Kaoculus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"that is your own opinion, but it's an ignorant one. for many people, losers finals was probably the tensest and most exciting match of all of evo. it might have been one of the longest at 30 minutes, but it was also 30 minutes of me sitting on the edge of my seat. great footsies, display of matchup knowledge, mindgames on ultra punishes, and just an outright battle of endurance. a real clash of titans butting heads and seeing who gives in first. sf4 has never been the type of game that you've described, and high level play always looks something like this, although obviously not as long.  the reason why you're getting hate is simple. it's like telling a bunch of film connoisseurs that ""x"" movie was terrible because it wasn't action packed when other critics are raving about it for its depth. it's your opinion, but don't expect to get any love or respect for it when the reason you don't like it is because it didn't pander to the ignorant masses that want massive combos and fancy links."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,adrian783,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from. it's like that maypac boxing match. fortunately, most of sf4 isn't played lame."

StreetFighter,3dwq78,DR_Hero,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:20 2015 UTC,Because Elena is more advantaged with her great pokes if he constantly walks up and gets aggressive. He has to keep fireball zone in Elena's head and pick his times to go in.   Gamerbee was really clever and able to turn what should have been a pure keepaway matchup into a scramble.
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Drwam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:49 2015 UTC,If you pause at 5:25 you can see the moment in which he realizes that he has sold his soul to the Devil. I love how much passion he puts into this game.
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Crashgroove,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"Infiltration showed great ability to adapt during this set, but one thing that I think people are overlooking is just how smart Gamerbee was.   Gamerbee was sent to losers bracket by Infiltration on Friday. They also played Chun vs Elena, but Infiltration really shut Gamerbee out with his fireball game. When I saw that it was going to be the same matchup again, I thought for sure that Gamerbee was going to be eliminated. Thankfully, I was wrong because Gamerbee clearly did his homework after Friday and came in with a plan. Gamerbee turned the matchup around and forced Chun to be the aggressor which really impressed me."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,SavingPrincess1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:50 2015 UTC,"Only an uneducated scrubset of players are knocking Gamerbee's play.  You know who gave Gamerbee the most credit for his play? Infiltration.  This was SF at the highest of high levels.  Everything was in play, Meta, Mindgames, Execution, Endurance, etc.  It was easily my favorite match of the entire weekend, and that was after an incredible top 8 overall.  Every match I was saying ""wow, that was the best match of this tournament..."" and then Gamerbee x Infiltration's half-hour marathon best of 5, just blew. my. mind.  EDIT: Infiltration's biggest mistake is that he didn't have a good counter to Adon/Elena.  Juri was a GREAT counter-pick to Elena, but he didn't have an answer in Juri's arsenal for Adon's simple neutral game."

Laughing, patting each other on the back, agreeing to take a moment to decompress and drink some water... It's awesome to see moments like that during such a competitive event. Really great stuff."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,CeruSkies,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:05 2015 UTC,I think this cements it: Elena or any heal mechanic won't be returning in SFV.
StreetFighter,3dwq78,SavingPrincess1,4,Mon Jul 20 10:55:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I were a developer, and I was watching EVO, seeing that the hypest match in years with the biggest crowd reactions was because of a mechanic like that, I FOR SURE wouldn't put something like it in my next game.  /s"
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Velikan1,-10,Mon Jul 20 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"I guess everyone here likes to tear people a new one if they are hating on Gamerbee. Those Elena matches were the most anti-hype sets ever. It was 7 AM when I was watching and this was a snoozefest. I am glad that he got blown up by Momochi.  Before you rip on me saying that it is a totally viable strategy, it is! You are right, it is viable and it is well played. But if you wanna see 3 healing ultra's and see every match go to time-out, more power to you.   I was watching Smash finals and saw Hungrybox go for a time-out with his Jigglypuff and I commended him for it until I realized that if he is gonna try and pull that every match then we're in for a horrible finals."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,shining_,7,Mon Jul 20 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"""Blown up"" lol resets the bracket and goes to last game last round but yeah, totally blown up by Momochi desperation top tier counterpick"
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Velikan1,4,Mon Jul 20 17:16:41 2015 UTC,Momochi desperation top tier counterpick   My point. Apparently you can discredit Momochi because his character is top tier but when someone says this particular Elena fight was pretty lame he is treated like the devil.
StreetFighter,3dwq78,shining_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:57 2015 UTC,Not discrediting Momochi but that set was the complete opposite of a blowup  The Elena play is fine because the opponent doesn't have to throw fireballs to give him healing. They can just as easily sit back and play footsies but they're scared of Elena's midrange buttons. Why blame Gamerbee for using the ultra to his advantage? He didn't even use Elena vs Momochi anyway
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Nivyan,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"It's funny you compare Hungrybox to the Elena healing mechanic.  Hungrybox is basically the onetrick pony of the smash community who gathered a massive following after he was 'victimized' by his 'own community' for being 'cheap' (he talkes about it in the Smash Brothers documentary). He the finally 'defeated his demons' and has since been treated as this insane player, even though better players have shown to be able to do his act; mango and m2k rocks pretty badass jigglypuffs :D  I was watching Ultra finals and saw Gamerbee go for a time-out with his Elena and i commended him for it until I realized that if he is gonna try and pull that every match then we're in for a horrible finals--- sounds really dumb doesn't it?  EDIT: I play Elena a lot and was amazed by Gamerbee' performance, put those pitchforks down."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Velikan1,0,Mon Jul 20 15:17:38 2015 UTC,I do not know two shits about Smash but if you wanna see Hungrybox timeout everyone then more power to you. Same thing for Elena and her ultra.  I think it's boring to watch and apparently nobody is allowed to say it. This character has caught so much flak for being cheap and lame and now suddenly Gamerbee is hauled a hero for using her. Gamerbee even stole Momochi's spotlight (which he didn't intend to so I am sure) and people are even clapping for him for not building meter during that pause-loss.   I just do not understand why Gamerbee is hauled as a champion and Elena is suddenly hype because I am not seeing it.
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Redner,5,Mon Jul 20 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"Elena isn't hype, Gamerbee doing what it takes to win was hype and watching Infiltration and Gamerbee evolve throughout the set, adapting to each other constantly is what people are raving about."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,CaptainNeuro,2,Mon Jul 20 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"She's not cheap. She's effective. Nothing more.   When you get to main stage at EVO, you're there to win. If you put on an amazing show like these guys did, it's a bonus. In fact, if I'd managed to get there and my opponent didn't pull out every trick in the book to make the fuck sure they did their best to win, I'd be pissed."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Retrofaction,-8,Mon Jul 20 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are so desperate to make themselves look better or 'prove' that they're not scrubs. That Elena play was disgusting, and the character is idiotic. She already makes a mockery of street fighter's neutral game by reducing it down to random EX overheads, but she can also produce the lamest most boring playstyle ever seen in a tournament game.  The match after was good but that was NOT a good street fighter match."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,SavingPrincess1,7,Mon Jul 20 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"Nope.   You are looking at a Picaso painting and going ""WTF, dude can't even draw people right, lol scrub."""
StreetFighter,3dwq78,Retrofaction,-6,Mon Jul 20 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"Your analogy is only half there. It's like going to an exhibition of realism styled art, seeing a picasso painting and realising it doesn't belong there.  I'm allowed to dislike Elena just as much as i'm allowed to dislike picasso, so stop acting like an asshole about it."
StreetFighter,3dwq78,SavingPrincess1,0,Mon Jul 20 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's so easy to run the table with her, I guess we'll be seeing Retrofaction in top8 next year? :)"

StreetFighter,3dwq78,VoltSlash,-12,Mon Jul 20 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I for one am NOT convinced by Gamerbee's win. Half a pixel with a timeout is just too goddamn unconvincing.   It was an outstanding fight, sure, but Infiltration adapted successfully to every thing Gamerbee threw at him. And, on top of that all, was fun to watch. Gamerbee wasn't, at all. Ever.  Fucking Elena."

StreetFighter,3dwq78,VoltSlash,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"Never have I ever compared anyone's skill to my own, so what are you getting at? I've never even been to EVO, but that's also beside the point.  When you watch whatever sports you like, don't you have opinions on the coaches' tactics? The referee's calls? And I suppose you're no professional athlete in any of those sports.  I merely said that I wasn't convinced Gamerbee was better than Infiltration. The fact is he took the match, but imagine the match had ended 1 sec later? All it would take would be a bit of chip damage. So, in my opinion, it wasn't convincing at all.  Gamerbee used many different tactics, and every time Infiltration successfully adapted. And during the last match, Gamerbee had the advantage, Infiltration was locked with Juri, and he still almost lost the match.  Furthermore, it takes enormous skill to play that many characters at such a high level... Infiltration has got more high level chars than most other players. Is it wrong to recognize that as well? Or do I have to be MLG to express my opinion?"
StreetFighter,3dwq78,declimax,0,Mon Jul 20 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if the match had ended a second later, cause it didn't. Gamerbee won. He was the better player."

I'm also trying to get into it but the truth is that in my country people play a lot of smash and there's like 10 sf players, 2 of them who actually invest time into it.   With SFV coming out next year and the amount of fighting games coming to pc , I'm willing to invest my time into fighting games, but learning to play alone is frustrating , especially for a moba player. Moba players usually invest a lot, aswell as RTS and any other more serious competitive games players, I can say that I spent about 8 hours a day playing.  Lets translate that to a player that is trying to switch. I switch from a 5v5 game with lots of communication to a game where I don't know anyone and spend 6 to 8 hours a day trying to figure out the game by myself... Thats why moba players won't switch to fighting games, its frustrating and the core stuff has to be researched in foruns (great links here btw). Basically SF problem in popularity will always be the same as SC2 (archon mode should help a lot with lotv coming out)  I have also to say that this community is one of the best, and dozens of people from reddit really helped me out.

Not trying to flatten myself, but i've got to Challenger status at LoL in 2 seasons and have won a few local SF tournamentos in the last few years aswell. It's all about how much you want to win, instead of how much time you spend playing.  With SFV coming out, i do hope that people get easier access to info on how to improve, your point on how it's still kinda hard to make friends when playing 1v1 games is pretty valid imo."
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,ZeonHUEHUE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"Im from portugal :p   But how much you want to win also translates for the time you spend playing. Don't tell me that a person that plays 8 hours a day for 10 years the same game doesn't want to win x) Nothing to do with how good he is tho.  They have to release a system similar to Coaching on Dota, or Archon Mode on SC2 to make that viable.   You have the groups on steam , but thats not ingame, there should be a viable way to practice things in separate , like only footsies, only fireballs, hitconfirms etc. The worst thing for a new player, is having to deal with all that at the same time. The SF team has to have some practice/tutorial modes that new players can rely on.  I think the money thing announced yesterday will bring a lot to sf5 actually, people talk how bad that is in league, but it also keeps players playing, you play to get more characters, and when you don't have characters to get, you keep playing cause you already spent to much on that to change games x)"
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,FTW_KyaTT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:22 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with you. I'm not familiar with the coaching methods you mentioned but this is definetly something that would make the game a bit easier for those with a bigger learning curve. Maybe they should create some co-op missions for training basics like whiff punishing and situational punishes?
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,ZeonHUEHUE,-5,Tue Jul 21 12:00:47 2015 UTC,nah all the 12 year olds are busy playing smash.
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,Glurky_Spurky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:18:25 2015 UTC,from what i saw on twitter the league of legends official esports twitter was tweeting about the SF finals and most of the LoL casters were talking about it too so that was some nice free publicity.  i wish i could play SF half as good as i play LoL tho. but i just cant find people to practice against (online practicing is hard because im laggy due to geographical reasons.) that aside SF is my favourite game to watch

StreetFighter,3dwp5t,ChyloVG,32,Mon Jul 20 05:11:47 2015 UTC,It was stupid and some of the most despicable gameplay I've seen in Street Fighter.  Which is exactly why it was one of the most incredible and memorable sets I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. God damn that was amazing.
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,nerdbotmkii,7,Mon Jul 20 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"Could Infiltration be the best SF4 player? I mean, not the best character specialist, but the most skilled player. He can play whoever he wants whenever he wants at the highest level, he is incredible! It's like if he were the 2nd best player in the world with ""half of the cast""."
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,Drwam,7,Mon Jul 20 13:34:51 2015 UTC,he is without a doubt the best sf4 player.  at evo alone he has gone 3rd like 3-4 times and won.
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,hobdodgeries,5,Mon Jul 20 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"I almost feel like loser's finals was the better of the two matches.

StreetFighter,3dwp5t,HigherCalibur,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:35 2015 UTC,I agree. Momochi played very good the whole top 8 but probably the great match was infi vs bee

StreetFighter,3dwp5t,KingOfSockPuppets,19,Mon Jul 20 04:07:53 2015 UTC,"I was rooting for Infil so hard, but Gamerbee is not a bad finalist to have. If he can win, it will be a great capstone on his EVO career. From exploding onto the scene with a character everyone thought was dead to this. He's got my finals vote at least."
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,14Deadsouls,11,Mon Jul 20 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Infil has won my heart with his character variety, but I will also root for Gamerbee. He's been so good for so long."
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,budafist,4,Mon Jul 20 04:13:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Infiltration really brought the hype and Gamerbee really brought the fight.   This is the first Evo where I can certainly say that, for me, the top 3 all deserved to win. Outstanding fighting from them all."

StreetFighter,3dwp5t,Mirage84,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:15 2015 UTC,Gamerbee Vs. Momochi Grand Finale!  God the last matches were epic as well!
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,blazecc,5,Tue Jul 21 05:34:25 2015 UTC,Grand Finals is better.  Not trying to one-up you or downplay the Gamerbee/Infil set because up until Grand Finals their Loser's Finals set was the best I'd ever seen but HOLY.  SHIT.  IT ONLY GETS BETTER.  This EVO is AMAZING.

StreetFighter,3dwp5t,fmal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:25 2015 UTC,Besides the time scam it was just so epic. I will always wonder what if infiltration did ex dive kick...
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,NoobAtLife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:06:00 2015 UTC,I was honestly pissed about the set. He should've picked Ultra 1 instead in my opinion. ESPECIALLY if you were planning on playing that kind of match.
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,BlueFreedom420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:57:04 2015 UTC,"Who are you talking about? If you're talking about Elena, Healing was arguably the most important ability Gamerbee had, and is probably a the biggest reason he won. If you're talking about Chun, I don't think Ultra selection matters too much for a fight like that?"
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,Beginning_End,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"Should be pretty clear that I was talking about Infiltration picking U1? If people think I'm salty over Elena U2 then you're so damned wrong.  In the side room there were a bunch of times I was screaming my head off for an U1 punish when he obviously had charge and Elena was whiffing specials for meter.  And plus, especially if Elena is going to play that kind of matchup where she will be focus backdashing a lot, you need to optimize damage. If she plays that kind of matchup, she WILL be in the corner for the conversion for extra damage. And as you saw, every single bit of damage mattered in that set.  And although I havent tested this out extensively, but I was willing to bet that whenever Elena double backdashed into Healing, you can match each dash with a forward dash, and utilize the ultra freeze duration to store a charge for a U1 punish for every far away Healing Gamerbee did.  Like honestly, if I were to play that matchup, I'd pick U2. But if I saw that mentality from the opponent, I wouldve immediately picked U1 with no hesistation.  At that point, you're playing your Ultra as a viable threat to take away options, since the chance of you landing a U2 (which I believe he only got off once) will be rare and not worth the potential payoff."
StreetFighter,3dwp5t,1338h4x,0,Mon Jul 20 20:46:42 2015 UTC,Great match. I just wish the clock stopped during cinematics. Its not like the world will explode if there are a few more seconds to a match.

The whole point is for testing out the netcode so in a sense, after couple of testing, Capcom will try and see if they can make connects between places like ASIA with US. or Middle-east to US. Because if you are going to tell me ""hey just play people from your region"" you are DEAD WRONG. Where I live, Literally months and months until I stumbled across one person from my region.

StreetFighter,3dyno8,Beginning_End,5,Mon Jul 20 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been 100% confirmed, but it's likely.   3 is essentially after almost all of the other world warriors have solved their stories. Bison is gone, Charlie and Guile are gone, Balrog got his fight money and retired etc..   So the speculation on that front is that by having guys like Charlie in the game (meaning probably Guile as well), Cammy and Bison, that this is their final contribution to their storylines. That once Bison is destroyed, those characters who's main objective is to stop him or gain vengeance would retire or be dead or whatever.   Also, Ryu, in 3 has mastered the Denjin hadoken, but in V it looks like he's just staying to be able to access it via his V-trigger."

The Oni form is so different from Akuma base and Shin form, that it would be too dramatic of a change in my opinion.  Oni could have his own V Trigger if he were to appear in the game.

StreetFighter,3dwitk,FluffyBunbunKittens,33,Mon Jul 20 08:54:13 2015 UTC,"I like the fact that he proves wrong all those ""leaks""."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Fedatu,8,Mon Jul 20 03:43:42 2015 UTC,"Does he? The basic rumor was 4 new characters and three of the names were given. If the next new character is revealed and they don't match one of the names (Zen, Rachid, Laura) then I'll agree."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,king_awesome,2,Mon Jul 20 09:44:15 2015 UTC,Last one was named New boss. This doesen't looks like a boss character.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Fedatu,2,Mon Jul 20 10:01:27 2015 UTC,"You sure about that? It looks like his V-Trigger turns him into like Evil Ryu or Akuma. The boss version could just be a permanent form of that, where as the playable version is just his V-Trigger."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,ayyyooo,9,Mon Jul 20 14:30:52 2015 UTC,His trailer looks just like other chars trailers. I guess for boss they may made something more impressive. And it would be strange to revial boss character when only 50% of chars are shown. Probably we will meet boss closer to release.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Fedatu,4,Mon Jul 20 14:37:30 2015 UTC,I'd rather they not reveal the boss at all and we find out playing instead.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Caulidemo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:27 2015 UTC,But people no longer like surprises and aren't satisfied if they're not drip-fed all of the information about the game before it comes out
StreetFighter,3dwitk,declimax,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:54:34 2015 UTC,And then buy him for fight money?
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Fedatu,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:56 2015 UTC,Why not? Or just unlock him by beating him.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Kalulosu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:33 2015 UTC,If you want? I guess? I'd rather just unlock him through Gameplay.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Caulidemo,4,Mon Jul 20 17:33:49 2015 UTC,who was even believing those? i mean the guy face was on Ken's trailer
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Alchnator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but before we knew his name he could have been any of the named new characters because we didn't know anything else about them. Now we know his name, we know they're all false."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,SpoonyGosling,19,Tue Jul 21 01:30:38 2015 UTC,It makes sense that this character is an Aztec warrior with big red hair.  Street Fighter has always been influenced by JO JO.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,BlueFreedom420,8,Mon Jul 20 05:30:37 2015 UTC,He's basically Santana.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,HierophantG,7,Mon Jul 20 06:47:02 2015 UTC,I think he has the color of Santana with the ridiculousness of Kars' hair.   Which I REALLLLLY like. New main hyyype
StreetFighter,3dwitk,edogvt,3,Mon Jul 20 07:22:37 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of kars, specially the whole ultimate lifeform and evil power up."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,banberii,3,Mon Jul 20 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"He's Pickle in his normal form, v-trigger is Yujiro Hanma, both from Baki the Grappler"
StreetFighter,3dwitk,realrapevictim,2,Mon Jul 20 18:03:34 2015 UTC,Can you tell me some of the influences Jojo has on SF? All that comes to my mind is Guile's hair.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,darkgreenpants,11,Mon Jul 20 07:37:55 2015 UTC,Rose is inspired by Lisa Lisa and Juri is inspired by Jolyne.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Human_Sack,7,Mon Jul 20 08:10:53 2015 UTC,Guile and Stroheim as well
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Exec_Tran,4,Mon Jul 20 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe a bit of a stretch, but T. Hawk's headband is quite similar to Ceasar's headband."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Louis_Vuitton_Mom,3,Mon Jul 20 14:11:26 2015 UTC,Dhalsim is inspired by the pillar men
StreetFighter,3dwitk,declimax,2,Mon Jul 20 16:55:41 2015 UTC,and a little bit of Avdol
StreetFighter,3dwitk,wyrmw00d,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"Hes got loads of greek design in him, and even has a greek structure in the background of his official art. I'm thinking Ancient sealed evil greek warrior."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Bungfoo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:54 2015 UTC,Then why give him an aztec name? That's weird. I guess it could just be multiple influences.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,TheChicanoChikage,7,Mon Jul 20 17:28:51 2015 UTC,What i wonder is does Necalli has 2 supers? cause he also ends with a special sequence.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,DannyDarkside,23,Mon Jul 20 03:10:40 2015 UTC,His Critial Art probably changes while in V-Trigger.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,AceDrgn,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:23:45 2015 UTC,Doesn't that mean he has to build meter while in vtrigger?
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Caulidemo,10,Mon Jul 20 15:31:09 2015 UTC,V-Trigger doesn't use super meter.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,MystyrNile,7,Mon Jul 20 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yes he has, according to this anyway.  http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/07/19/a-new-challenger-joins-street-fighter-v-introducing-necalli/"

StreetFighter,3dwitk,huge_toes,7,Mon Jul 20 03:29:57 2015 UTC,I love how that sheep falls down in the background on a hard knockdown @0:22
StreetFighter,3dwitk,reuse_recycle,13,Mon Jul 20 06:20:22 2015 UTC,This is what happens to your wolverine character designs when you lose your marvel license.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,NecromancyBlack,10,Mon Jul 20 06:05:21 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Iori from KoF.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,siamyl,2,Mon Jul 20 08:57:14 2015 UTC,"I like the refurbished Berserker Barrage X and Tornado Claw.  Edit: And regular Berserker Barrage. Okay the more I watch, the more it just looks like reskinned Wolverine. Which I'm totally okay with."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Khr0nus,5,Mon Jul 20 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"I love him, looks very very fun."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,uuglint,4,Mon Jul 20 03:33:51 2015 UTC,If you watch 'til the end it looks like they cleaned up Ken's face a bit.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,PacMoron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:34:04 2015 UTC,It does appear that way. Good eye!
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Beginning_End,4,Tue Jul 21 03:54:55 2015 UTC,"Very primal... Caveman like and then he goes all satsui...   Interesting looking character. If I play a bruiser, he definitely gets my vote over Birdie."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,pickle_fucker,3,Mon Jul 20 06:15:41 2015 UTC,"Is it the announcer we hear at the end with ""Necalli Wins""?"

StreetFighter,3dwitk,Metalman1988,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure what this guy is but, he has a very brutal style that I enjoy.  Not sure what the satsui deal is about though.  Maybe he's an experiment of Seth's when he tried to obtain data on Ryu's satsui no hado.  Just an idea.  He just feels like a cross between E Ryu and Blanka LOL.  He looks fun though.  Love his critical arts too."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Obsidian_Fox,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:10 2015 UTC,This guy's effing brutal!
StreetFighter,3dwitk,KingAskia,2,Mon Jul 20 05:12:50 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you can defeat an opponent resulting in pushing the player through the mine opening into a mine cart, and the momentum rolls them down into the darkness."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Louis_Vuitton_Mom,0,Mon Jul 20 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"I really like the stage transitions in Injustice and some 3D fighters. I wouldn't mind if that mine cart brought the fight to a completely new area, or if the winner on the street stage had to chase the bus to its next stop to continue the fight."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Wheres_Nemo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:26:23 2015 UTC,Welp. I know who I'm gonna main.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,blacklite911,3,Mon Jul 20 12:52:35 2015 UTC,Wolverine with a command grab??? Sweet.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,darkgreenpants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:29:21 2015 UTC,He looks amazing.  I wonder if he is actually evil or just extremely savage/wild.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,magicoreo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:32:33 2015 UTC,They seem to have a thing for those face grab moves now. (counting decapre and charlie) Can't complain though it looks great

StreetFighter,3dwitk,J0ET,0,Mon Jul 20 17:14:09 2015 UTC,He better have a taunt like this https://youtu.be/BI851yJUQQw
StreetFighter,3dwitk,MrSups,0,Tue Jul 21 01:40:49 2015 UTC,So he looks like a quick grappler.  Cool. Grabbler designs have always been a bit stale in most fighting games. Street Fighter does it better than most but still.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Azuvector,5,Mon Jul 20 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"Uh.... Dunno about you, but grapplers aren't particularly stale in other games."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,MrSups,2,Mon Jul 20 05:54:00 2015 UTC,yeah SNK does grapplers really well
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Sobou_,4,Mon Jul 20 06:05:47 2015 UTC,"KOF13 Clark is a lesson in game design. Really interesting character to play (against). Chadha is really cool in Yatagarasu. Only Tager in BB got the low tier treatment. Potemkin is usually strong but not in Xrd for some reason ? And he lacks a lot of things from previous games that made him more interesting to play (imo).  At the end of the day the best grappler designs I've ever seen are Cerebella and Beowulf from Skullgirls, they are so radically different from what you are used to see, they have a lot of tools but still got really interesting mindgames."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Louis_Vuitton_Mom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:59:11 2015 UTC,"Man, I love Clark. I should move to Mexico, I do speak Spanish."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,BlueFreedom420,9,Mon Jul 20 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"Actually street fighter does the worse job. Every street fighter grapplers end up being the weak characters. Capcom loves making grapplers have near impossible match ups.  SNK did it better with blue mary, Damon Goro, Clark etc Yatagarasu did it better with Chadha. Even Guilty Gear's Potemkin appears in grand finals."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,MrSups,4,Mon Jul 20 05:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah Street Fighter has that problem. But I was talking more in terms of design.  Most games have one Grappler and that's it. If you like grapples enjoy this one option. Street Fighter has like 2-3 per series and they play very differently. Granted most of them are slow, huge dude in terms of design while others like SNK runs the gamut."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Dinjoralo,-6,Mon Jul 20 05:57:17 2015 UTC,"Jesus, his dreads are crazy. They might need to tone those down, a bit."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,SoapOperaHero,6,Mon Jul 20 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"Ehh, Street Fighter's always had super-exaggerated character traits. If they're gonna put in a character with dreads it only makes sense that they're over-the-top."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,NecromancyBlack,4,Mon Jul 20 03:50:36 2015 UTC,"Dreads aren't that bad, it's just the free swinging hair in the engine that makes it look weird."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,jia2,-1,Mon Jul 20 08:58:05 2015 UTC,It's pretty cool seeing a character use the satsui no hado without knowing ansatsuken. I wonder if that's why he can only use it temporarily.
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Caulidemo,5,Mon Jul 20 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"Where is the confirmation that it's satsui no hado? It could be some withheld Aztec power for all we know.  I'm not attacking you or anything, just want a source is all."
StreetFighter,3dwitk,Volt52121,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:34:05 2015 UTC,Wolverine minus adamantium claws?  Prediction: Next new character can shoot light beams from his eyes.

StreetFighter,3dw9jn,Respula,23,Mon Jul 20 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"I am so glad he is healthy now after those health scares he had a few years ago including collapsing in a bathroom. I wish the best for Ono. Possibly among the most fun personalities in game development. I would say Tak Fujii was another fun one when he was making Konami games.  But Ono is about a close a saint of fighting games as there is. Right alongside Blazblue's Mori, NetherRealm's Boon and Guilty Gear's Ishiwatari."

StreetFighter,3dw9jn,hobdodgeries,12,Mon Jul 20 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd argue about Boon being on that list till my deathbed, but whatever you like to think. I just personally feel he's very biased when it comes to CERTAIN characters of the MK universe.   Of course, Ono hates Ken, so I guess there's that..."
StreetFighter,3dw9jn,Respula,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"Ed Boon made 8 garbage fighting games that were only popular because of blood, digitized graphics (for the first 3) and nostalgia (for 5, 6 and 7). I don't think he belongs on any list."
StreetFighter,3dw9jn,shelcod,6,Mon Jul 20 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"While I don't believe he belongs on a list of any sort, I don't think he deserves that of much of a backlash. He has definitely left a legacy, that much can't be argued. He really helped popularize the fighting game scene for American developers and honestly helped in creating a lot of childhoods for a lot of people across the country and arguably the world."
StreetFighter,3dw9jn,Respula,4,Mon Jul 20 04:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the original MKs weren't garbage. They were actually unique. Other fighting games were just clones of SF2, MK was a direct response to that. And a lot would argue about the competitive validity of UMK3. 4 5 6 7 was pretty garbage though, although 6 (Deception) included a plethora game modes and an actual decent for the time online mode. People sleep on that MK Puzzle fighter honestly."
StreetFighter,3dw9jn,blacklite911,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:12 2015 UTC,It only seemed cringey because of chat but it was definitely hype to me.

StreetFighter,3dw9jn,Ophe00,4,Mon Jul 20 02:10:12 2015 UTC,"It looked like an E. Ryu-esque dive kick. Plus a command grab, ground slam, dp and a charging move. Seems like a party to me.  Edit: The dp and the charging move could be different versions of the same special."
StreetFighter,3dw9jn,KingOfSockPuppets,5,Mon Jul 20 03:58:36 2015 UTC,Looks like a rushdown-oriented grappler. That should be interesting.   I was immediately reminded of Yujiro from Baki the Grappler.

StreetFighter,3dw9jn,KidCoheed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"Common sense is where I figured that, as a Grappling character with the main idea of pushing in fast and hard especially with groundpound I doubt that wiffing on throws would be acceptable especially the speed the throws came out in the trailer so rush in hit and immediately input throw would be the best or at least most effective way to play him"

StreetFighter,3dw9jn,Bungfoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"I know people have been saying central america/brazil and he certainly has a aztec/mayan vibe. But I think hes greek fighter. But more than likely an ancient possibly sealed away greek warrior judging by his loin cloth.  Looking at this picture  Character  Judging by the patterns on his calfs  pattern  I would definitely say greek pattern.  Also if you look at the building in the top left it looks more like greek buildings than aztec/mayan. Sample building I based this judging off the domes on the buildings and because the pattern is greek.  Of course this is just a theory, but going on that he doesn't seem to talk much and seems wild, I am taking a guess he was an ancient sealed evil warrior.   However the name Necalli is Aztec (Nahuatl) which mean Battle. So this does mean he could have some aztec influence there."

StreetFighter,3dw9jn,KnightNight-,4,Mon Jul 20 01:43:52 2015 UTC,As much as my nostalgia would miss the iconic character of Blanka - the part of me that enjoys really tight competitive matches with good roster representation would be very happy to see an aggressive grappler replacement for the green shenanigans.  Blanka is so frustrating to overcome for newer players and at higher levels of play he doesn't usually accomplish much outside of the first match. I agree with you in that he likely won't be missed much.
StreetFighter,3dw9jn,ObsidianSkyKing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:48:34 2015 UTC,Looks like his name is Necalli. IGN kinda messed up on this one http://imgur.com/YXr2oQR

StreetFighter,3dz9sj,Furbishkov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:29 2015 UTC,I actually was just at the EB games near my place and asked about the beta codes as I have pre-ordered but not received a code yet. They said something about Sony telling them to stop sending the codes out as there was some sort of internal problem. I don't really know what this means but I hope I get my beta key one way or another.

StreetFighter,3e0kt0,wyrmw00d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"Just play arcade mode with each character to get a feel for them.  Do the trials to learn moves and combos.  Decide who you like from there.  Don't immediately go online.  It will be very disappointing.  I literally fought a guy the other day who could sweep, H punch, and throw.  Everything else seemed like accidental specials.  I didn't even know how to approach that.  I let him win round 2 and I finished him quick in three.  Not to be mean but to maybe inspire him to practice to be able to combo like I did him.  I enjoy at least semi competent players.  Arcade is fun and trials are fun to me too.  Not a big KOF person but Ryu is a very balanced and solid character for those starting out with SF.  Just my opinion."

I bought it as my first one, thought it seemed alright from the reviews too and it was cheap, so why not? Months later I finally realize just how much it was holding me back. The buttons are terrible, the stick makes so much noise, and the case is tiny. I know sticks are expensive, and I'm still saving for a really nice one myself, but the whole, ""you get what you pay for."" adage rings more true here than with anything I've bought in a long time.   TLDR; It's not a terrible case, but all the parts are garbage and I wouldn't buy it if I were you."

StreetFighter,3e0h4r,Kingish_KSH,4,Tue Jul 21 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"The Mayflash was MY first stick, and I have to say that this stick is terrible. Do NOT get it  The parts are very cheap, but the joystick's centering is pretty good, but DEFINITELY not the programming with it since it's picky with what games it wants to connect with. Modding a Mayflash means you're only using the base and nothing else inside the stick. Furthermore, you have to sand the button holes of the base to even fit any decent buttons. I got a Qanba Q1 recently and what I have to say about it is that it is MUCH better than the Mayflash. It's parts are at least decent, comes with gates for the joystick and plugs for buttons if you want a 6 button layout, and simply because it looks very well made. It has clamps for your desk, but you can always remove it. For 80$, a Qanba Q1 is a very good price for a beginner wanting to play with an arcade stick on PC (Note: there are PS3/360 versions of this stick. Both of them work with PC as well).  Here's the Qanba Q1 on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Qanba-Q1-PS3-Joystick-Fightstick/dp/B00BXPIO1S/ref=sr_1_1"

The game is still almost a year from release with half of the cast fleshed out since it was first announced, there's plenty of time for aesthetic tweaks."
StreetFighter,3dxqwk,NShinryu,-8,Mon Jul 20 12:16:54 2015 UTC,"Look, lets be realistic. When they ""changed"" how ryu and chun li looked... it was ONLY different color schemes! You could argue maybe texture too... Chun li just got a different make up, and lighter skin color. BUT nothing major like different polygons.   Now as for Ken, it doesn't seem like he changed, if he did, its hard to identify, just because we need to see the comic con Ken play against necalli and lose to him so we can see necalli win pose where he lifts him up in the screen. Even if i were to get two pictures of Ken, one is in the necali trailer, and the other is in comic con trailer. you cant tell the difference because of the different face expressions he makes."
StreetFighter,3dxqwk,NShinryu,11,Mon Jul 20 12:28:24 2015 UTC,"Look, lets be realistic    The game is a year from release, they are still making new characters, there is time to change all of this shit when it comes to polishing the game for release. You can't, with 90% certainty, say what they might change or might not change, because they have all year to do it and you don't know what they might do.

Regret. But higher approval rating.   In those situations the player shouldn't have the pressure of that decision, particularly in grand finals.   it's a shame it happened at all.

It's hard to know if it's a command grab or a strike like Abel U1. If it's a grab seems slow enough that unless it goes through fireballs it'll be a semi-distanced punish only. I hope it's a strike he can cancel into.    Floaty jump with a steep divekick could present some interesting front back mixups since he can seemingly combo cleanly from either.   He seems mobile with his slashes and divekick etc. but at no point in the video do we get to see his walkspeed, a character with high mobility and a damaging command grab is an interesting prospect.  Side question: Non-shoto under the influence of Satsui no Hado?"
StreetFighter,3dxtc7,NShinryu,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"V-Trigger just powers up his moves, his rush punch slash gets three hits, etc.  Although it was also EX, so might just be because of that."

StreetFighter,3dweh4,UserUnknown2,3,Mon Jul 20 12:01:21 2015 UTC,Tokido showed a few times he plays a bit to calculated and doesn't tend to really play risky much. I think it ended up being his downfall a few times.
StreetFighter,3dweh4,avengaar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:09:00 2015 UTC,Why did that teleport get hit? I always thought it's an instant escape.
StreetFighter,3dweh4,blueb34r,3,Mon Jul 20 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"He wanted to get teleport, what happens sometimes is red fireball comes out like that during a crossup. Basically Tokido would've won that if he did teleport because there would've been enough time to punish the whiffed DP of Ken"

StreetFighter,3dweh4,rabidmunks,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:10:25 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't politically correct to say but: Tokido lost that match, not Momochi being clutch. Tokido had a number of opportunities to chip it out and play aggressively with the life lead but he, instead, played way too shy and backed off (literally, watch the GIF again and watch how much ground Tokido gives away to Momochi unchallenged)."
StreetFighter,3dweh4,platypuspracticus,3,Mon Jul 20 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"he was pretty aggressive with the demon flip but I think it was a yomi response to how many air tatsus momochi was bringing, and momochi was clutch in making the perfect adjustment (staying put) at the perfect time. I mean from Tokido's perspective, after the dude does the 95th air tatsu throwing a fireball at 3/4 screen starts to feel like a bad idea  I would have liked to see some more neutral jumps at that range from Tokido but lets be serious we're not speculating this shit from 4th place at evo either"
StreetFighter,3dweh4,Dog_Lawyer_DDS,2,Mon Jul 20 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"He had no meter, so it was difficult to risk anything big. Doing a crouching mk to hadouken isn't always a block string, and against momochi, a player of great caliber, Tokido could not risk much."
StreetFighter,3dweh4,platypuspracticus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:55:59 2015 UTC,"He had meter until he used it on the EX air hado. Would have been better off going zoning since he had made such space with the teleport. But it doesn't matter, he crumbled as soon as Momochi got that throw after the cr forward."
StreetFighter,3dwx42,Beginning_End,16,Mon Jul 20 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure Momochi felt dirty, just that he knew the win has a slight question mark on it.   I mean sure he took the round loss and came back to win the third, but who's to say Gamerbee wouldn't have won that round anyway and taken the momentum into the final one?   Anything could have happened but honestly, Momochi and Gamberbee - Even Infiltration - would have been deserved winners so no ones gonna be too upset about that. Just the manner in which it happened really killed the flow."
StreetFighter,3dwx42,14Deadsouls,6,Mon Jul 20 05:38:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to disparage the win, just comment on the fucked-uppedness of the situation, which Momochi clearly acknowledged."
StreetFighter,3dwx42,14Deadsouls,2,Mon Jul 20 05:52:44 2015 UTC,Indeed. I'm so gutted at how it went down.
StreetFighter,3dwx42,OldGravyLeg,6,Mon Jul 20 05:57:11 2015 UTC,"GamerBee can't feel bad at all, they're equally good and it just went that way. It's not like he got blown up and he made Momochi crack and counter pick."
StreetFighter,3dwx42,Quasimodox,5,Mon Jul 20 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"Gamerbee will obviously, after processing all of this, realize he's guaranteed in to Capcom Cup,  has a butt-ton of seed points and all...   But that ending was so harsh and you could tell he was hurting. Momentum was just slightly leaning his way at least on an emotional level. He was feeling it, the crowd was feeling him... And then there's a drive killing malfunction and he promptly gets bodied. Game over, goodnight.   That was rough. You could tell that even Momochi didn't like the way things went down, despite top seed and gobs of cash."
StreetFighter,3dwx42,Shippoyasha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yah, close to the end after the award ceremony, Momochi was talking to Gamerbee, I believe he was trying to apologize how it went down (it wasn't his fault of course) and Gamerbee understands that. Both players are extremely mature on handling the situation and show great sportsmanship."

Especially in a situation like this, I don't know if he got a new stick right before the fight but I doubt it, imagine all the wear and tear it will have gone through especially with travelling. Yeah what happened was shit but everyone in this sub seems to be crying bloody murder.

StreetFighter,3dzmcu,NoobAtLife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"Rolento.  You'll play a patient spacing game with good normals and a shitload of kunais, but once you get one knockdown you're free to go ham because his j.HP is so hard to see if its a cross-up or not in a lot of situations.  However, this character requires HEAVY reactions for his optimal conversions and a good amount of technical skill to link quite a few things."
StreetFighter,3dzmcu,MrSophie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"First of all,  you got downvoted because we have daily threads for questions like these.   Now for characters,  I have 2 suggestions.   Ryu   He's the best character to teach the game to a new player. You will learn good fundamentals with him. He's the most standard character that rewards great spacing and patient play.    Ibuki   She has the best vortex (okizeme)  in the game. She also has really cool normals but your neutral game really has to be on point. You will sometimes win the round with a single knockdown."
StreetFighter,3dzmcu,MrSophie,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"Ok I understand I didn't know something like this belonged in a daily thread, fair enough.  I spent a couple hours already with the game and I've realised I'm a slightly more defensive player than I thought. My blocking and spacing are by far my best assets so far.  I will definitely give Ibuki a go because I didn't even consider her. Otherwise I'll just stick to Ryu as he is the one I'm most comfortable with for now anyway.  The other character I really enjoyed was Abel, but I see him as more of an advanced character I guess.  Thank you very much."
StreetFighter,3e02xf,Kugruk,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:56 2015 UTC,It's probably because your chaining the lights instead of linking them.
StreetFighter,3e02xf,flyingcloud11,2,Mon Jul 20 22:41:50 2015 UTC,This is exactly what it is
StreetFighter,3e02xf,Spiral0Architect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"Just so I can make sure I understand the terminology correctly: I need to be waiting for each jab to complete it's animation, including recovery, before I jab again and them tatsu? I was under the impression that the ""xx"" shorthand meant cancel. Do I need to be linking 3 jabs and cancelling the last jab?"
StreetFighter,3e02xf,PandaIkki,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah,that's exactly right.   Jab, jab, jab xx tatsu, not jab xx jab xx jab xx tatsu"

StreetFighter,3e02xf,xTeriosx,3,Mon Jul 20 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"Just to point it out, you only need to link the last jab. You can chain the first two jabs, but you need to link the last one to make it special cancelable, so you really only need to slow down the last jab."
StreetFighter,3e02xf,Spiral0Architect,2,Mon Jul 20 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, awesome. Thank you for that. This is starting to make a lot more sense in my head. Can't wait to get back home and get back to it."
StreetFighter,3e02xf,SickCase,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"Just to add on his close medium kick had some changes that are going to help you out here. First off while you should still learn to do chains into links on those light buttons for the sake of overall improvement you're going to want to go with cr.lp cl.mk xx tatsu if you're punishing something -3 or  cr.lk cr.lp cl.mk xx tatsu if you're trying to open up and hit confirm. This is because in ultra it got reduced to 4 frame start up making it easier to link off of cr.lp, it forces standing so the tatsu won't whiff and it's range got increased so you don't have to be as close to prevent yourself from getting far mk. It also can't be chained from cr.lp, only linked so you know what the problem if any is."
StreetFighter,3e02xf,Novelty_Frog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"You need to link 3 jabs, not chain them. So chaining occurs on mashable normals. If you chain anything you can no longer cancel into specials. So you need to make sure you are linking the jabs by waiting as long as possible between each one."
StreetFighter,3e02xf,Spiral0Architect,0,Mon Jul 20 23:08:56 2015 UTC,Practice makes perfect. So first get down the timing of the 3 jabs dont worry about canceling the tatsu just yet. Once you get it down at least 10x without failing then move onto canceling a single jab into tatsu. Same thing do it 10 times without fail then string it all together.  But remember practice.
StreetFighter,3dzyxj,doreato,5,Mon Jul 20 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"Playing charge characters gives you a good habit to always hold down back - defense is something a lot of beginners struggle with, but charge characters by nature help you learn to block at all times.  Even the design of Rose has defense in mind. Rather than a traditional quarter circle forward, her fireball is half circle forward which starts with holding back, which is also a means to blocking.  Seth Killian explained all these concepts eloquently way back when he was with Capcom. You should read up on his pieces. You also might want to check out David Sirlin's works."
StreetFighter,3dzyxj,defearl,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"It's just an alternate design space to explore.   ""Hey Jim, what if we had characters with awesome normals but some drawback to their specials?""  ""Could be interesting, give it a shot."""
StreetFighter,3dzyxj,Nybear21,3,Mon Jul 20 22:29:04 2015 UTC,So charge characters tend to have better normals generally?
StreetFighter,3dzyxj,Nybear21,3,Mon Jul 20 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yepp, if you look at Chun, Guile, Bison, and Balrog, you'll see really good examples of those dominant normals making up for the charge specials."

StreetFighter,3dzyxj,tsphan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:10 2015 UTC,They can go from blocking to doing a special rather than inputting a command. Take Guile being in a crouched blocking position into a Sonic boom for example. Shotos need to change from blocking to a dp motion and aren't blocking for that amount of time.
StreetFighter,3dzyxj,MystyrNile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:33 2015 UTC,"It makes them pay a price for moving forward or jumping, or doing standing normals. Or blocking high or crossup."
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Metalman1988,5,Mon Jul 20 15:58:30 2015 UTC,I'd rather just leave Evil Ryu/Oni completely out of the picture for this incarnation of Street Fighter!
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Rug_d,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"Not me so much.  Oni is a bit much when it comes to DP mashers.  His DP recovery is stupid fast and the timing of the punish has to be super quick.  That and the occasional EX crossup claw (made that up but we all know what I mean).  I've been blocking a combo and when that move kicks in I switch blocking directions super fast and still get hit sometimes.  That bothers me.  I'm almost positive that it's a hardware malfunction or it's just the way the game is.  Evil Ryu is my dude.  He's really not dirty in the least bit IMO.  That may be biased but, He doesn't have any reliable ways to get inside to get his combos started.  low forward, hadouken, FADC and then yeah...COMBO!  Ken, Ryu, Akuma, almost all projectile characters can do that.  If anything, E. Ryu is harder to work with than Akuma.  His damage output is greater, but stamina is very close and Akuma has way more mobility.  Oni can go, I want my Evil Ryu to remain.  Dude's sick as F***!"
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Rug_d,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"If they keep Evil Ryu then I want him a bit different.. sure he's kinda explosive and that is cool, but a lot of what Evil Ryu does isn't really Street Fighter in my mind, hard to explain :/ Just because he has low health doesn't mean he should be combo videoing people for touching them one time sorta thing :P"
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Nybear21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:34 2015 UTC,Well we already know Ryu's V-trigger powers up his Hadokens
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Nybear21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:54 2015 UTC,Right.  I think Chun Li's gives her the ability to fire kikokens at a faster rate?
StreetFighter,3dyifb,NoobAtLife,2,Mon Jul 20 16:18:27 2015 UTC,It got changed to give her Medium and Heavy normals additional hits
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Nybear21,2,Mon Jul 20 16:19:40 2015 UTC,"Theory right now is that it gives her extra time to feasibly hit-confirm off single hits, so you'd most likely just use it with her CA to get a c.MK xx CA without relying on godlike reactions. Or hit-confirm off c.HP.  But honestly, I think for her it's probably going to be used more for free damage off V-Reversals. You probably won't see her V-Trigger that often in this variation of the game."
StreetFighter,3dyifb,NoobAtLife,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"It gives her really sick block pressure, so it will probably get used a good bit"
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Nybear21,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think so? If you're pressuring with normals you get the same amount of pressure with any other Medium or Heavy moves. Unless it changes the frame advantage of the move then you may have a case. But until we actually get a training mode for the game, if it's the same amount of frame differentials then the V-Trigger is pretty useless in my opinion.  I mean, you may have a case for block grey life, but I dont think that will make much of a difference in a game where you can't chip out an opponent."
StreetFighter,3dyifb,Nybear21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:24 2015 UTC,Not a bad feature to have at all.  We've seen Ken's in action too.  Seems to me that it powers up his specials a good deal by adding the flaming ki to it all.  Bison's also has pretty mean effects catching and throwing projectiles back amongst other things I'm sure.  Haven't looked into Nash that much.

I actually think they might be able to do it reasonably well on the PC/PS4. Unreal 4 is much better at this type of thing than the old tech was.  With IV they definitely had to figure out where to draw the line... clearly they wanted shorter hair and weren't confident they could animate it in a flowy way.

Essentially it boils down to lack of intuitive inputs compared to pad or fight stick and lack of access to some advanced stuff like piano(others can be harder to execute as well).  Other than that SF has very lenient controls in terms of diagonal inputs, so all standard motions can be executed as good as on any other controller (or even better in some cases).  360 and 720 can be tricky, but its that ""lack of intuitivity"" problem.  Overall, set a hitbox layout and you'r golden."
StreetFighter,3dyx9u,Moonway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:57 2015 UTC,"I play on keyboard. Most people will map up-down-left-right to the WASD keys or Cursor Keys, because of familiarity w/ FPS.    Unfortunately, that means you'll have 4 buttons assigned to your middle 3 fingers, which is not ideal. Split off one of those buttons (e.g. space bar) and map it to a button for your thumb. That lets you have dedicated access to all 4 directions. (either thumb for jump/up, or thumb for down -- I use it for down).    Once you have that, it's much easier.    My config: - ASDF for light-medium-heavy-3x Punch - ZXCV for light-medium-heavy-3x Kick - Q for light punch+kick - W for medium punch+kick - I, 0(zero), [, M for Left, Up, Right, Down - I'm right-handed, so figured complex directional controls should go to my right hand. However, if I ever switch to a fightstick, I'd be screwed since directional controls on a stick are on the left side."

StreetFighter,3dyx9u,GoodTimesDadIsland,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"I may be late to this discussion, but I would say keyboard play is completely viable (especially on a mechanical keyboard like yours). I would however highly recommend setting your inputs to something similar to this system.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuGaeg0c-0E  You can also use this channel to figure out how specific inputs/types of characters are played on a hitbox styled controller."
StreetFighter,3dyx9u,chodywhoisthat,0,Tue Jul 21 12:13:43 2015 UTC,"very viable. as people mentioned, use the hitbox layout though. Mine is: a,s,d,[space] = left,down,right,up kl;' = punches m,./ = kicks jn = shortcuts if needed"
StreetFighter,3dyx9u,hanyunanodesudc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:41 2015 UTC,I cant play this game very well if the movement commands aren't on the right side. It's very hard for my left hard to even do a simple dragon punch motion. I've been using the arrow keys so far.
StreetFighter,3dyx9u,hanyunanodesudc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"This is precisely why I put movement on the left hand. I was used to movement on the right hand, until I tried to transition to a fightstick years ago. It was impossible because my left hand was never accustomed to rapid movements vs my right. So I started using this layout on the keyboard, which was still unbelievably hard at the start. But after years, I'm really used to it now so I can use both for movement. This should also make it easier to transition to a stick (or at least, not as nearly frustrating and hard)."
StreetFighter,3dyx9u,hanyunanodesudc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"Even if I don't really plan on ever transitioning to a fightstick, switching movement to left hand is worth it?"
StreetFighter,3dxzcd,IMSmurf,4,Mon Jul 20 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"The bots in this game are unfair, especially as you get closer to the end of arcade mode.   They aren't really good for practice for human opponents, they aren't programmed to play anything like human opponents. They will randomly not block your attacks for no reason, they will read your inputs and hit you with an inhumanly possible reversal dp/ultra even when you're not close to them and hit a button, they will do things that don't make any sense and they will work.   The best way to beat them and still learn things is to play super safe, use only far pokes and anti-airs. If you just want to beat arcade mode, they die to hard knockdown (sweep, throw) and then level 3 focus over and over."
StreetFighter,3dxzcd,NShinryu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"Lol okay that's what I thought, thank you. I have another question if you don't mind how do i over input. Like left B I'm trying my hardest but the inputs are saying I'm not hitting them at the same time. It looks like I'm hitting left and then I'm hitting left and B at the same time."
StreetFighter,3dxzcd,NShinryu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"What move in particular are you trying to do, with what character?   In terms of describing moves, it'll be easy for you to understand others and vice versa if you use lk, mk, hk, lp, mp, hp (light, medium and heavy kicks and punches) to describe buttons rather than the names of the face buttons on the controller. If you see PPP or KKK: it means all 3 together, these usually have a dedicated button on controllers."

StreetFighter,3dxzcd,Krimson037,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"For Kikoken, you need to ""Charge"" the move by holding back for roughly 2 seconds, then inputting forward and any punch button"

StreetFighter,3dxzcd,Nybear21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what lines you're talking about, but there are no visual indicators for charge. You just kind of get used to it. Also, if you're struggling to get the fireball out even though you know you have charge, make sure you're hitting your punch at just about the same time as you release the charge."
StreetFighter,3dxzcd,grimeguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Anytime the motion is Back Forward or Down UP in SF, it's a charge attack."

StreetFighter,3dxzcd,Metalman1988,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"The trade off is charge characters have exceptional normals. You can also charge a lot more than is immediately apparent. During throw animations, ultras, while you're jumping, etc etc"

StreetFighter,3dtify,DINOSAUR_BLOOD,15,Sun Jul 19 11:30:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's incredibly hard to have that feeling with Juri entirely because of how she's designed. There is no one way she's optimal. She's just fucking good no matter how you want to play. Zoning? Cool. Rushdown? No problem. Anything in between? We got you, son.   It's one of the reasons I'm amazed she's always seemed so slept on. Once you understand her fundamentals there's a pretty sickening amount of paths you can go with her."
StreetFighter,3dtify,CaptainNeuro,3,Sun Jul 19 15:39:37 2015 UTC,It just makes her that much harder to play
StreetFighter,3dtify,thejerrbear,2,Sun Jul 19 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"I'd personally disagree. It makes her harder to MASTER, but even if you only practice with one style of Juri, she's fucking good, and fairly simple at that.   The only complexities come from trying to combine the styles, which while useful, is by no means necessary to play her at a high level. In that respect she's no more awkward than Guile, for instance. Somebody who only practices rushdown Juri but does it consistently is going to be much better in a fight than a jack-of-all Juri with the same amount and dedication of practice, but both are perfectly valid."

StreetFighter,3dtify,szakigeri,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"She was considered by some to be number 1 or number 2 in the Ultra pre-console JP arcade release. I don't know how much they nerfed her on the switch to console, but we didn't really hear people talking about her after that."
StreetFighter,3dtify,NShinryu,5,Sun Jul 19 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"She got a serious meter building nerf on fireball store and release if they don""'t connect on block or hit.

StreetFighter,3dtify,Beginning_End,6,Sun Jul 19 12:40:17 2015 UTC,"Aiaitomo, before this EVO, was considered like the 3rd, maybe 4th best Juri player in Japan (he was often made fun of because he was offensive to the point of being careless and full yolo).

StreetFighter,3dtify,Noocta,6,Sun Jul 19 12:20:02 2015 UTC,"It's one the most basic set-ups for Juri in the corner after hitting a 2MK > 2HK, you go into Light Senpusha, jump...  If you hit MK, it hits in the back and depending on the character ends up in front of in the back and if you hit HP, it hits in the back or in the front depending on the character but always end up in the front. The jump HP, if you do it deep enough, will hit in the front always but will set your opponent up for some fuzzy guard shit.

StreetFighter,3dtify,Noocta,2,Sun Jul 19 16:40:00 2015 UTC,Jump HP is what my friends and I affectionately refer to as the Bullshit Button.   It's what your opponent will invariably be saying under their breath after it's hit. Every time.
StreetFighter,3dtify,CaptainNeuro,2,Sun Jul 19 15:36:34 2015 UTC,I don't even want to talk about this shit if the opponent is Rose or Abel...   I remember back in AE 2012 Juri had some disgusting corner unblockables off forward throw against Rose. I'm guessing she has similar setups with U1?
StreetFighter,3dtify,hvymntl,4,Sun Jul 19 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, and against Abel, if I remember correctly my set-ups (it's been quite a while since I've played Juri), you don't even need Feng Shui."
StreetFighter,3dtify,Hyunkel,2,Sun Jul 19 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that particular setup is forward throw - forward dash - whiff lk pinwheel. Jump lk is unblockable against Abel and Fuerte; jump hk is unblockable against Rose."

This is why street fighter will never 'grow' in a sense of becoming mainstream. It has a very high learning curve and almost anyone you play has 4+ years of experience over you. You don't find anyone your skill level online because those people only found matches against veteran players so they quit.

Alex might be the best person to fill that role.  Being a big grappler kind of guy would make sense.  They have that in common at least.  Who knows how the story could make them rivals.  Maybe they just ran into each other and fought.  Maybe the similar fighting styles made them more competitive?  We don't know anything yet.  Look at SFIV though.  They added El Fuerte and Abel.  Both of those guys are grapplers of a different kind of grappling.

StreetFighter,3dwrn7,CosmicEdge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"It's really tough because everyone learns to play in different ways. I for one, don't mind being in the training room for 2 hours grinding out combos, but some people get tired of that. Don't forget that the most important thing is to have fun.   Pick a character and learn all their special moves. Go online and learn their bread and butter combos. Go from there. Whether it's a bit of arcade mode or if you're a masochist go online early on. The best and fastest way is to find other people that just started like yourself and play with them. Watch videos of better players to learn new things. Ideally, find someone that knows how to play and is willing to teach you. Join the Newbie Fight Club group on Steam, there you can find not only people your own skill, but also better players willing to teach you.   Good luck, have fun"

Finally, on the steam club, do they only play the pc edition or do they cross over to console's as well? Thank you very much"

StreetFighter,3dvxsa,Lithium43,10,Sun Jul 19 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"These are links, not chains. Every move has a certain amount of hitstun and recovery. The difference between those values is called frame advantage (or disadvantage). If you hit the opponent with, say, Ryu's crouching medium punch, the frame advantage is +5, meaning that you recover into neutral state 5 frames faster than the opponent's hitstun ends. Since the cr.mp starts up in 4 frames, you then have 2 frames to press it again to hit the opponent before he can block, making it a 2-frame link, provided you are in range for it.  When you want to link a move after another, you have to use the second attack as soon as the first one ends. If you press the button too late, it will be blocked since the opponent is already out of hitstun. If you do it too early, it won't come out since you were still in recovery when you pressed the button.  Try holding back after you do a move a few times. If you do that, your character will start moving backwards as soon as he recovers from the move. This will help you to get a rough timing of when to hit the button for your next move. For the more exact timing, it's trial-and-error. Once you get it right a few times, it becomes easier."
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,Mottwww,2,Mon Jul 20 00:04:18 2015 UTC,"This is a great explanation, thanks mate I never understood whats up with these Frames bs everybody is talking about on the bemu wikis. But fuck yeah now I know :D."
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,Candabaer,9,Mon Jul 20 00:13:13 2015 UTC,There is a reason why SF4 is not a user friendly game. Mastering links/combos are the most tedious thing in the world. You have to practice for hours on end inorder to land the simplest combos consistently.
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,Riceata,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"I kinda just assumed I was incompetent, because every single review I read of this game would say something along the lines of ""fun for everyone easy to get into,"" and then I got the game and could hardly do anything at all.  And yes, a large portion of the 50 hours I spent playing (or tried playing) this game were spent trying to figure out why the hell the combos dont work consistently. I played a mod for this game called Sf4Remix and found it much more fun than the basegame, and the only reason I'm even bothering to play unmodded is because I want to play online."
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,jodon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:21:28 2015 UTC,It is a easy game to start out in because you don't really need link combos in the beginning. You can play a decently competent game of street fighter with just cancel combos but it is most often not optimal damage or safe damage. What the game is really about is space control and in most cases you can do that with just your specials and buttons. But it does really help if you can learn one link from your lights.
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,TomHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"I think it depends of the definition of ""get into"". Links like that aren't required at a more casual level, and whilst they are needed to compete at high level, you wouldn't need to worry about not being able to do them yet (by all means practice is good though).   This game combos aren't as important as other fighting games, and most characters have at least one simple combo that doesn't require strict timing to use if your opponent becomes punishable. (Eg. forward hp into uppercut for Ryu)   I have no idea what your play is like, but you should try and make sure you can use your characters anti-airs and know how to space their moves well before you get onto harder combos.  Don't worry, your not at all incompetent for not being able to do links yet."
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,Taurtis,3,Mon Jul 20 01:11:10 2015 UTC,Your timing has to be really spot on. It's difficult trust me. You just have to practice a lot and find the timing in between where the attack doesn't come out at all or when it's blocked. The best way I can describe it is each combo has a certain rhythm to it. At least that's how think of it in my head whenever I'm trying a combo or link.
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,KyleKiwi,2,Mon Jul 20 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"Check out Vesper Arcade's tutorial, sounds like you're having issues with linking in particular"
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,solidsmoke,2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:14 2015 UTC,Something that is really useful for this: on each hit a tiny indicator will flash along your opponents HP bar. Time your next hit for when it reaches the right side of their HP!
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,SavageNoble,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"One thing that may make links a little easier: Turn off vsync in the game's graphics options if you haven't already. Vsync adds some input lag that can throw off your timing. When you have a 16 ms window to link a move, a few ms can make a difference."
StreetFighter,3dvxsa,Caulidemo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"16ms seems completely insane and would explain why these link combos in the challenge mode never work for me. Also, is this game only viable at higher levels of play if you have a hitbox?"
StreetFighter,3dwz8l,DMCFLY12,6,Mon Jul 20 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"We can't know. It sucks that a pause had to happen in the worst possible moment. Sure, Momochi looked like he was winning...but I think we can agree if anyone could bring it back it was GamerBee at that moment, who was playing his best Street Fighter of his whole life.  Momentum, mental focus and fortitude are very important but finicky. A pause murders all of that. Both players know this and I'm  sad for both of them, as Bee can't help but think about if he would bring it back and Momo probably has his doubts over his win as well. Great EVO, but fate (more precisely the razor stick) decided to be cruel in the very end."
StreetFighter,3dwz8l,LungDrago,5,Mon Jul 20 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"The consolation is that even though Gamerbee missed out on his USF4 Evo championship, he's automatically placed in Capcom Cup and will get a metric fuck-ton of seeding points.

StreetFighter,3dtyf6,appropriate_name,5,Sun Jul 19 13:04:34 2015 UTC,I've always been fascinated with what an Online Tier list would look like. I don't think I have enough experience fully understand whats really good in this game in an offline capacity so. What do you guys think are top and bottom in regards to online?
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,kastle09,6,Sun Jul 19 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"I can give you my top 5 for online.  1)Blanka  Blanka  2) Ibuki  Vortex is basically unblockable online.  3) Cammy  Random drills are very hard to block, and her e z p z links means they won't often drop their combos for consistent damage.  4) Rose  Random drills are very difficult to punish online and her amazing backdash means your slightly mistimed setups due to input lag are just free escapes for her.  5) Zangief  Input lag means that spd setups that you would normally be able to escape via backdash or whatever can potentially just land anyways.  Agree? Disagree?"
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,Blueclaw_,4,Sun Jul 19 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"I do agree on random drills from cammy. Actually I have problems with a lot of the characters that have something, Dudley's ex Machine Gun Blow comes to mind. I get caught by that by a surprising amount"
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,kastle09,3,Sun Jul 19 15:52:46 2015 UTC,I think it's probably the worst of those kinds of moves online because it hits low. Cammy is there instead of someone like guy or whatever with similar moves because Cammy has the advantage of being actually good.
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,Blueclaw_,2,Sun Jul 19 15:56:29 2015 UTC,Fuerte has to be in there.
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,Beginning_End,2,Mon Jul 20 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"Needs more fuerte, rolento, decapre. The characters you listed are too legit IMO!"
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,vertigo90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree on your explanation for Cammy. Her links are not easy. Her easy, meterless combos are all hit confirms or one button cancels which are easy for every character and hers, like most character's, hit for less than 200 damage. Her good damage like close or low Fierce>low forward>drill or (Several Buttons)>Drill>FADC>Fierce>Drill or close fierce>stand fierce>drill for example are not easy, especially online where one frame links are never guaranteed. Drills are hard to block in the neutral but just as difficult as any low hitting distance move like 'Sim, Rose, Elena, Ibuki, Blanka, Guy, Bison, Fuerte, or Hakan. And Cammy's are both unsafe and easily defeated by walk-n-squat. Good Cammys don't just throw that move out because of this. Falling for random drill is like getting beat by ken's step kick. It doesn't do a ton of damage. It doesn't combo if it's random. And it's never the difference between winning and losing. Overcoming the move is a matter of looking at the distances, being ready for it when the match-up comes and punishing."
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,Doom_DDS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:16:58 2015 UTC,Who would you put there instead of cammy then?
StreetFighter,3dtyf6,Blueclaw_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:20 2015 UTC,Decapre. Her scramble is difficult to deal with anywhere online or not and I can't tell you how many times I've been too late to punishing a stinger which is negative in the double digits for all forms. Daggers is hard to punish as well because it pushes characters so far away. Her version of spiral arrow is plus. And offensive oriented charge characters are always a pain to fight because of how far and how quickly they can go from being a turtle to a rushdown character. Her hitbox is sort of wonky so she falls out of some character's juggles and combos. I'd pick her for sure.

I kinda wish it wasn't, because that means some characters I was hoping for won't be in the initial roster, but it makes too much sense. Also, I think the blue section really is only for Alpha characters, since they are emphasizing so much that every character they're including has a story-based reason for being included. Since Charlie is obviously an important character in this story, it makes sense that several people from the series he was in would be included since they are likely also caught up in that story."

Same with Urien. He may not be someone people have been asking for, but it just sort of makes sense, with the way Charlie is now and everything going down. Urien as a boss character may actually be pretty sweet come to think about it, just beef up his mirror a ton for the boss version of him and suddenly we got another super hard boss like Gill."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,ItsDominare,6,Sun Jul 19 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"People have been asking for Alex for a long time   Yeah. People also voted Birdie in something like the bottom 3 of all SF characters ever in terms of popularity and yet here he is, so I don't think Capcom gives a shit."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,HierophantG,5,Sun Jul 19 16:27:55 2015 UTC,Capcom does listen to character requests. They just won't except every single one if it overlaps with their design vision.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,capitannn,5,Sun Jul 19 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"True, and lots of characters aren't popular because they haven't been in a game in forever anyways"
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,ayyyooo,2,Sun Jul 19 20:26:12 2015 UTC,Except it makes sense with their new character DLC model to have the more popular characters come later on.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,vdenav,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yup. But like I said, I think Alex and Urien make the most sense in terms of story, since it seems like we are going to delve into street fighter 3's story a bit more."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,CeruSkies,3,Sun Jul 19 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"I really think that there's a pattern. They never do these things randomly.   +2 SF, +2 SFIV, +4 SFV and +4 SFII, +4 Other games (Alpha and SFIII)"

StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Aerius-Caedem,4,Sun Jul 19 15:21:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, like green could be ""appeared in SFIV"", blue could be ""bringing them back from an older title"", and purple is ""new people""?"
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,MasterDenton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:51:37 2015 UTC,This makes the most sense to me.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Beginning_End,3,Sun Jul 19 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Could also be 8 characters from the ""Street Fighter"" series, 4 from the Alpha series, and 4 new ones. That would explain why the green side has SF1 and SF2 characters in it.  As for Birdie being in the blue, possibly Alpha section, maybe that's a nod at his redesign being introduced in Alpha as his SF1 version no longer exists?"
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Lamedonyx,7,Sun Jul 19 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"My predictions:  Ryu, Ken, Guile, Blanka, Chun, Akuma, Bison, Cammy from SFII  Charlie, Urien, Alex, Birdie from other SFs  And Dude from Ken's trailer, A Final Fight character, and two completely new characters."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,krispwnsu,4,Sun Jul 19 12:26:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know why exactly those are your predictions... But I really hope that you're correct.   Guile and Urien are the two characters I want back most, followed by Alex."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Krimson037,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:49:45 2015 UTC,"If they bring Alex, they need to bring Hugo/Andore as fast as possible."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Hydroloxx,4,Sun Jul 19 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Even though I love Akuma, I would rather see Vega in the first 8."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,soliddeuce,4,Sun Jul 19 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"Remove Akuma and add Juri and I'd believe it. People seem to write off Juri, but I think she's more guaranteed than almost any of the cast because of her story implications."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,luigifan103,3,Sun Jul 19 20:57:44 2015 UTC,"I want this roster, but something is telling me that they would have Zangief or Dhalsim before Guile."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Hasuman,3,Sun Jul 19 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"Having Sakura, Juri, Makoto, Elena, Ibuki, Mika, Karin, fuck even Rose would be better than that sausage fest. Urien and Alex are probably a lock but there isn't a reason to immediately push them into the game. I'd swap out Blanka/Guile for Dhalsim/Gief because I can't see them leaving those two out. Dhalsim is way to unique of a character to be cut, especially with how they are pushing the V-Skill system. I can also see them passing on Akuma for someone else like Vega. Abel will come back eventually, probably after release."

StreetFighter,3dtsgb,MasterDenton,0,Sun Jul 19 23:26:20 2015 UTC,Guile wouldn't make sense since Nash is already in this game.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,HolyKnightPrime,4,Sun Jul 19 18:23:13 2015 UTC,Nash plays completely different from Guile in this game.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,NShinryu,4,Sun Jul 19 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"Guile makes perfect sense. The game's going to be more story based, and Guile is vital to Nash's story. Plus, they've already de-cloned Nash, so Guile's gameplay niche is yet to be filled."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,SarcasticLizard,5,Sun Jul 19 20:52:46 2015 UTC,Ken looks more asian than Ryu.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,HolyKnightPrime,7,Sun Jul 19 14:06:17 2015 UTC,Isn't he supposed to be 3/4 Japanese? It shouldn't be particularly shocking.
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,NShinryu,3,Sun Jul 19 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"yeah a lot of non-j characters have japanese ancestors for some reason. even sean has a japanese grandpa, who of course is the one who taught him how to fight"
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,CoolTom1337,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:14:15 2015 UTC,A 3/4 Japanese who looks more asian than a full asian is not shocking? Ken who has always looked white and suddenly looks asian now is not shocking?
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Khr0nus,3,Sun Jul 19 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"Some Asians look more Asian than others, it happens. It's not that shocking. Most people seem to think Ken is solely American, and are then understandably surprised.   I just look at it as Capcom bringing Ken more in line with his story, where he was previously painted as America's posterboy (Guile aside)."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,counters14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"My bets as to who's gonna get in?  Blanka, Zangief and Dhalsim for the green part, and Juri and Alex for the blue part.  I don't think the blue bit is going to be Alpha specifically. I think they're grouping it like SFII/newcomers/everyone else."
StreetFighter,3dtsgb,Beginning_End,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:00 2015 UTC,Ken's face looks almost normal in the pic however what happened to Cammy? Looks quite bad. :/
StreetFighter,3dvszv,RegretlessStrike,8,Sun Jul 19 23:12:43 2015 UTC,PC is pretty much the best version of the game. There is currently a sale on Steam. Do get it if you are interested in the game.
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Cymen90,2,Mon Jul 20 00:40:57 2015 UTC,Is it better then the 360 version?
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Izzy_Leveled_Up,5,Mon Jul 20 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. Also, modding."
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Cymen90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:00:03 2015 UTC,How come they use 360 for tournament? They should use the optimal platform.
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Izzy_Leveled_Up,12,Mon Jul 20 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"Consoles are much easier to move, set up, and connect to. Not to mention cheaper."
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Crazycupofjoe,2,Mon Jul 20 01:19:40 2015 UTC,As someone who regularly plays PC and 360 versions (360 just easier to move around for tourny's) I gotta say the PC version is the best.. there isn't much difference but that loading time between fights is over in a blink on PC :)
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Rug_d,11,Mon Jul 20 01:32:55 2015 UTC,PC>PS3
StreetFighter,3dvszv,PRRKRR,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:44 2015 UTC,I think PC may have a more active playerbase currently along with more stable connections and the closest gameplay to arcade (no input delay shenanigans)
StreetFighter,3dvszv,xamdou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:57 2015 UTC,Could you explain the input delay? I play on pc and decided to get a controller for sf very recently. Is it the controller?
StreetFighter,3dvszv,sevenstorm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"No, the PS3 version of the game has input delay built in  So, pressing a button will have it come out slower than normal"
StreetFighter,3dvszv,xamdou,2,Mon Jul 20 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"It is, and there are a lot of helpful group chats in steam that'll help new players."
StreetFighter,3dvszv,DoctorSugarbear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"It's definitely good and it's a lot easier to connect with other players through Steam groups than it is on consoles, from what I heard."
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Sabrewylf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:03 2015 UTC,It has some screen tearing issues but overall being able to use any usb arcade stick and the better connections make it the better option imo.
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Bier_Man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yea it's really active, especially with the recent sale on steam (ultra was ~$10).   It's pretty much impossible to play well without a console controller/a pad though."
StreetFighter,3dvszv,Ownagemunky,5,Mon Jul 20 00:24:04 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with using a keyboard. Inputs are easy and very precise and accurate. You may have an issue if you have a keyboard that doesn't support more than 3 keys being held at a time.
