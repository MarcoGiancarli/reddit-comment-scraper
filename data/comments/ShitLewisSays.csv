English used to have these forms too, before we replaced them. The nominative and accusative forms were replaced by the article combined with syntactic position, while the dative was replaced by 'to the' or 'by the', and the genitive with 'of the'.  For fun, if English had inherited the full Old English gendered article system, it would probably look like this:    Case Masculine Neuter Feminine Plural    Nom the that thee tho   Acc thone that tho tho   Gen thass thass thear thore/thear   Dat theam theam thear theam/thome    The definite article was originally just a demonstrative, as continued by the neuter 'that' (as opposed to 'this'), but the masculine nominative obviously took over as our indeclinable article 'the'."

ShitLewisSays,38spte,Fonjask,11,Sun Jun 7 09:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'm using Google Chrome on PC and it doesn't seem to be working for me on comments. On posts I can see it fine though. After testing it a few times to see whether it is behind the text above it, I've seen that it is appearing behind the block of text. I can slightly see it above where the points and flairs go. Here is a link to a gif of what I am seeing when I upvote someones comment. You can slightly see the text rising up in the back if you look closely."
ShitLewisSays,38spte,Vano47,10,Sun Jun 7 10:29:56 2015 UTC,I think it's because you're using Reddit Enhancement Suite. I just installed it there now and it's doing the same thing for me. I'll tinker with the CSS and try and fix it.  Edit: Should be all fixed now!

ShitLewisSays,37sp2i,SleepingInTraffic,15,Wed Jun 3 06:12:16 2015 UTC,I feel like the fact that I take satisfaction in this being upvoted even though it wasn't my work in the slightest is a fundamental problem with Reddit.

ShitLewisSays,37sp2i,Foxler,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look like I can edit the title. Is there a way I can't find, or should I just comment it?"
ShitLewisSays,37sp2i,V01t45,3,Wed Jun 3 06:09:24 2015 UTC,"You can't edit links once submitted, no. The only way is to add a comment with a link to the timestamped version."

ShitLewisSays,37dlds,jaffas_on_toast,11,Tue May 26 21:16:29 2015 UTC,Yes. I thought I'd see that up here as soon as he'd said it. I was in half a mind to draw the character and make a parody anime out of it
