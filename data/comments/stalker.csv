stalker,3e5ogt,FLU773RSHY,2,Wed Jul 22 05:40:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the STALKER film was one of the few that can actually pull off the long drawn out singleshot scenes with such precision. It's one of the reasons why it's constantly rated so highly among casual viewers and film critics alike. I'd recommend it for anybody who really like the game series, especially if they're more along the lines of the slow and cautious veteran stalker as opposed to the call of duty rookie stalker."

I suspect there'll be a quite heavy arsenal laying about XD  Personally i got a scoped tikka t-3 bolt action hunting rifle (.308), a bolt action Sig Sauer 200str (6.5x55. And a shitload of ammo for it), and a regular over-under 12ga shotgun (think toz-33). Also i got various hunting knives and such. Plus i know how to maintain them properly. I got plenty of camping and general survival equipment (duffle bag, medkits, sanitary alcohol, that kind of stuff), and general outdoor survival skills (that alone is worth a lot of equipment, because having a fancy assault rifle won't matter shit if you can't survive for 3 days in the wild).  I think i'd do okay in the zone. I'd stick to the outskirts until I get some good armor, and a better weapon though. Play things safe"

stalker,3dzmf9,callmebrick,4,Tue Jul 21 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"It can pretty tough to do at first with only a Makarov and a knife. What I like to do is go to the very end of the level first and kill the two bandits who guard the entrance to the Garbage. This will generally net you at least one MP5 and sometimes a sawed-off shotgun as well. Ammo will be scarce so shooting single-shot from low-crouch using iron sights is recommended, but it'll at least give you a small advantage to start with.  Another tip: Sneak into the room where Nimble is being held and head-shot any nearby bandits to kick things off, then take out the guy who patrols upstairs. This gives you an advantageous position with high-ground upstairs and plenty of cover downstairs from which to deal with the rest. That's how I always do it."

stalker,3dzmf9,Max_Chill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"Whoa, I actually hadn't noticed that, but it makes sense - I just figured enemy body armor scales up really well throughout the game, such that you need to be making the headshots with the more accurate rifles. Is there a justification for this logic?"
stalker,3dzmf9,thefeint,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly there so that NPCs who battle don't kill each other too quickly, and perhaps to inject a bit of added difficulty for the player. Definitely an awkward mechanic that has the unfortunate side-effect of making burst and full-auto fire less useful, but it mostly becomes a non-issue once you acclimate to compensating for it by always firing semi-auto."
stalker,3dzmf9,Max_Chill,3,Tue Jul 21 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"In stalker games, especially the first one, it takes a lot of bullets to take down the enemy unless you go for headshot which is almost impossible with the early stage inaccurate weapons."
stalker,3dzmf9,Tejas_Stalker,5,Mon Jul 20 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"• Enemies can see through bushes... I hear this a lot yet no one ever mentions if they pay attention to the visibility meter.  Likewise no one pays attention to the sound meter.  If you're rustling around in a bush making noise, they don't have to see you...they can hear you.  Shooting at a noise in the foliage will either bag you a person or a mutant and ammo is cheap in the Zone coming your way if that's where you're trying to hide.  Bushes are a poor choice against bullets.  Pay attention to the ground before you.  Grass, bushes, shrubs, trees, leaves, branches, pavement and other things you step on make noise.  Decrease the noise you make by crouching or low-crouch as you move.  • Enemies have owl like night vision... Seriously do you think you are the only one in the Zone with night vision? Depending on the armor they may have it too.  There is first and second generation too.  Don't mistake the amount of noise you are making with them having night vision every time ( see above ).  Again pay attention to your visibility and sound meter.  Enemies will often go to the location where they last saw or heard you.  It is wise to change locations if you are having trouble seeing them or have lost track of their last position.  The A-Life is not stupid and is capable of flanking you.  Often it doesn't have to see you, it just has to make an educated guess where it thinks you may go to.  • Scripted spawn and bullshit spawn... You didn't specify which Game you are in.  All the games have triggers for NPCs and mutants to go from off-line to on-line.  Just because you can't see them doesn't mean they are not there.  Only the last Game, Call of Pripyat has terrible spawning where they can go from off-line to on-line right before you or if you are at a designated safe spot from an emission.  Generally speaking SoC and CS don't do this to you unless you are at a level changer and they are traveling off-line to enter the new level on-line where you are at.  For this reason be wary near level changers when leaving or arriving.  Make manual saves before and after leaving every level just in case.   There are just some places that are the designated locations where spawns arrive at that are dangerous to hang around.  As mentioned this is worse in CoP than the others so I don't know which game, location and scenario you are talking about.  • Omniscient A.I. This might be just me.... Again pay attention to the visibility and sound meters.  Just because you decide to stand there mindlessly and check your inventory doesn't mean the A-Life will call a time out for you and wait for you to finish.  Do these actions when you are in a safe place.  The Zone does not reward thoughtlessness.  Another thing you may or may not have noticed, if you enter an area with men or mutants nearby and you make a save before they notice you, then initiate an attack that goes bad and revert to your save, it does not always go back to a point where you are undetected.  The save may revert you to where the A-life now included in range may detect you right away upon restart.  Make your manual saves far from the action.  The key to understanding the Game is knowing the differences, ranges and limitations of the A-Life.  Within a certain range you make it go on-line.  If it gets out of range and disappears from your sight, that does not mean it has left the Game.  It has simply gone off-line and it is still there moving to wherever it is scripted or needed to go.  Likewise you may look behind you and see nothing.  Then as you turn around men and mutants far behind you may have gone from off-line to on-line.  Just because you are not looking their way as they sneak upon you does not mean they came out of nowhere.  Surely you have seen other NPCs sneak up behind others."
stalker,3dzmf9,Kierlak,4,Tue Jul 21 05:21:46 2015 UTC,"I hear this a lot yet no one ever mentions if they pay attention to the visibility meter.   No, it's by testing it WITH the visibility meter that we know they can see through bushes. You can sit on the opposite side of a bush, crouched and unmoving, and the visibility meter keeps going up if they face you and down if they turn away.   Seriously do you think you are the only one in the Zone with night vision?    Maybe not, but they are not using the same NV we are using. If we can only see them by the light of their campfire through NV because it's so dark, but they can accurately find AND fire on us after a single suppressed shot from over 100 meters away, that's clearly bullshit."

stalker,3dzmf9,Tejas_Stalker,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you are missing the points here...   Bushes are a poor choice against bullets.   I wasn't talking about using bushes as cover. I never hide behind bushes. My point was enemy could see and fire at you from behind bushes even if you move around. Yet the bushes block your vision, which is how it's supposed to work if in real life.   Seriously do you think you are the only one in the Zone with night vision? Depending on the armor they may have it too.   Um, so the lowly bandits have perfect night vision that can see you from over 100m away and yet even with our military grade armor night vision, we still can't see further than 20m. Does that make any sense? I am fully aware the difference between 1st and 2nd gen night vision but even with 2nd gen night vision, it's still impossible to have long range firefight while the enemies can perfectly pinpoint where you are in the dark.    You didn't specify which Game you are in. All the games have triggers for NPCs and mutants to go from off-line to on-line.   I have noticed this in SoC and CoP both. Actually SoC is worse. I wasn't really talking about the A-life spawn. I was more talking about the linear fixed level spawn. I got some out of thin air spawn in Agroprom when I tried to get to the underground lab, also some out of thin air spawn when escaping from the tunnel after lab X18, some bullshit spawn in lab X18 and the last level where monolith guys spawn behind me from the paths which I have cleared. Not to mention the countless times of spawn right at your face after you change the level(which I call it spawn camping).    Again pay attention to the visibility and sound meters.   Ah, again I wasn't even talking about A-Life here. I was simply talking the A.I. Do the experiment yourself at the carpark repelling bandits mission in garbage in SoC. Try to run to the nearest truck to the fence which bandits come from. If you aim that direction from the left side of the truck, they will mostly likely come from the right side; if you aim from the right side of the truck, they will come from the left side. All this happens when they DON'T have line of sight of you with you being perfect silent.   Also experiment and keep the statics of this. Aim down an enemy hiding behind a corner and see how much time it takes for him to come out. Then open your inventory while facing the same direction and see how long it takes for him to jump at you. You will notice that without peeking out from the corner, enemy seems to know when you open the inventory. I said seems because I don't know the exactly A.I coding there so it's just from my experience and statistics. But you can do the experiment yourself too.    Really I'm not just making those things up. I'm fully aware of how A-Life works and the A.I mechanics. I've been binge playing all 3 games for the past months. Played vanilla then modded version again and again. Each time I play the games, those above points reinforce a bit more. I'm a guy all for fairness and realism so I don't like gamey mechanics like spawn trigger and those I mentioned before."
stalker,3dzmf9,Tejas_Stalker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"You mention bushes four times in your first statement but now you are not talking about bushes.  If an enemy saw you from a distance and moves closer where they no longer see you in an open space, guess what?  You're behind the bush. I said depending on the armor about night vision.  The basic Bandit armor does not.  Try adjusting the gamma and brightness in your Game to the same level you perceive your enemies to have. Depending on your system, your video card, your monitor and other factors no one has exactly the same settings. I've heard people complain it never gets dark in their game while others say it's so black at night they can't see their weapon. The former group needs to lower their gamma and brightness while the latter group needs to raise those same settings. No one setting applies to everyone. You must be using a Mod as you describe spawns in places that are not normal.  There are no Monolith in X-18 behind the paths you have cleared.  Monolith do not enter the Game until the AW unless yours is Modded.  I cannot speak for what someone has Modded into your Game as for being unrealistic and unexpected. I don't have to do experiments with the Game ( unmodded ) as I have been playing all 3 continuously since 2007.  If you don't like how a Mod has changed the retail version of the Game then don't use those Mods or find that Mod on the GSC Forums and complain about it there so someone can help you with that Mod or be aware of it's faults.   Another thing I forgot to mention is the enemy doesn't have to have night vision if they see you firing any weapons giving away your position by sight and sound.  You may not see them as you shoot at others.  Enemies will head toward that position by your muzzle flash and gunfire sound.  When they suddenly attack you it's not because they have x-ray vision, it's because they saw you way before you saw them.  Weapons that you can add a silencer to are a big advantage.  The Viper may be inaccurate but it's great for indoor combat with a silencer on it.  Loud weapons will cause your enemies to either come at you quicker or retreat for a better position.  Their unpredictability is the only thing that is predictable."
stalker,3dzmf9,Kierlak,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"You mention bushes four times in your first statement but now you are not talking about bushes.    I have always been talking about bushes. I guess I need to make the point simpler in case you still can't get it: bushes work for the player but doesn't apply to enemies.   I said depending on the armor about night vision. The basic Bandit armor does not. Try adjusting the gamma and brightness in your Game to the same level you perceive your enemies to have.    Um, I tried it. If you adjust the gamma to the point where you can see the enemies in the dark, the night will be unrealistically bright without nightvision and day time very bright. I don't believe that's how the game is designed to work like that. That's why some mods deliberately decrease the AI's visual distance at night times. People complain and make changes to that for a reason really. It's a common issue for a lot of people.   You must be using a Mod as you describe spawns in places that is not normal. There are no Monolith in X-18 behind the paths you have cleared.   Please read my comment again. Maybe I didn't say it clearly but Monolith bullshit spawn happened in NPP last level. And it happened in vanilla game only with ZRP bug fixes.     Again, I played the games both vanilla and with mods. Those issues exist usually in both, depending on what mods you use. I accumulated over 100 hours of gameplay time during 2 weeks' period so those issues become glaringly obvious. GSC got a lot of things right in the games but there are also a lot of poor designs in the games. They are not saints by any means. Even the mods, some mods are pretty poorly designed and unbalanced."
stalker,3dzmf9,mrtrotskygrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"hbkmog statement 1:   ""Enemies can see through bushes."" ""...vision blocked by the bushes or enemy runs behind bushes."" ""... even if you are behind bushes.""   hbkmog statement 2:   ""I wasn't talking about using bushes as cover. I never hide behind bushes."" ""...enemy could see and fire at you from behind bushes..."" ""Yet the bushes block your vision...""    hbkmog statement 3:   ""I have always been talking about bushes. I guess I need to make the point simpler in case you still can't get it.""   It isn't that you need to make the point simpler.  It's that you need to be more clear in what you say instead of the constant contradicting yourself.  Your first statement has the Player and Bandits hiding behind the bushes.  Your second statement changes to just the Bandits and states you never hide behind the bushes yet your first statement says even if you are behind the bushes.  After saying in your second statement that you weren't talking about the bushes as cover you say in your third statement that you have always been talking about bushes. The very mention of any bush used by any person, be it the Player or NPC involves cover.  Don't blame me because you cannot articulate in writing what you are thinking.  If you want to be on equal setting of visibility with your enemies, I suggested to adjust the gamma and brightness in your game.  If that reaches a point where you get the equal visibility you originally complained about but that is unacceptable because it is not dark enough then you have to decide what is more important to you.  Equal visibility where you are on equal terms for combat OR it's darker, your enemies pay better attention to your movements and sounds than you do and the game is harder.  Feel free to Mod the base game to make it easier for you.  hbkmog statement 2:   ""...also some out of thin air spawn when escaping from the tunnel after lab X18, some bullshit spawn in lab X18 and the last level where monolith guys spawn behind me from the paths which I have cleared.""   You used X-18 twice in the same sentence.  I did read it again.  It's unclear what you meant as the last level in X-18 ( the bottom floor ) has Military come in after you. It could have been a Mod. I was unaware what you meant because it was in the same sentence.  If you had clarified in the same sentence you meant the CNPP, Stancia 2 or the last level of the Game, I would have caught that.  As it stands you were not clear.  The last level of the Game has terrible spawning.  I agree with you.  It is very linear and tightly scripted.  Monolith will spawn directly behind the Player.  Monolith will appear high in the air and slowly descend making no sense.  Generally speaking once you enter the last level, it is entirely different from the open ended sections of the Game.  FYI: the ZRP is not JUST bug fixes.  It's a Mod with bug fixes.  It alters spawning rates and spawning locations of NPCs and mutants.  It makes the Game easier by allowing the Player to reduce or remove respawns.  It makes the Game easier by changing content and creating new level changers the base game does not have.  There's not supposed to be a level changer going from Yantar to the Agroprom.  GSC specifically added new content in the 1.0004 patch with new and more NPCs and mutants to make the Game harder.  A lot of people were very upset with this at the time back in 2007 so the ZRP had added to it changes to reduce those.  A lot of people complained that the walk from Yantar back through the Wild Territory, Rostok, Garbage and on to the Agroprom was too long, there were too many NPCs to fight, too many mutant  respawns to deal with.  So the ZRP added the new shortcut.   While there have been many versions of the ZRP, they all contain Mods in addition to the bug fixes.  People wrongly assume what they experience with the ZRP is the vanilla game which is the farthest thing from the truth."

You're behind the bush.   It's not a case of them knowing you are behind a bush and spraying the bush with fire, it's a case of them SEEING you behind the bush and shooting 100% AT YOU.   I said depending on the armor about night vision. The basic Bandit armor does not. Try adjusting the gamma and brightness in your Game to the same level you perceive your enemies to have.   And yet Bandits are one of the main offenders when it comes to having their right eye be thermal and their left eye be xray. Maybe they use the Force? Those bandit trench coats look a little like Jedi robes I guess.  As for gamma/brightness levels, to get the visibility level the NPCs have, it would be ludicrously bright at night, and blindingly, unplayably bright in the day."

stalker,3dvupz,CelicetheGreat,7,Mon Jul 20 04:14:56 2015 UTC,Some of the best experiences in Stalker have been dying.
stalker,3dvupz,Tejas_Stalker,22,Mon Jul 20 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, isn't this great.  This has happened to everyone that has played it several times and experimented with the Military.  Since it's the beginning of the Game when this happened you probably don't have the resources ( ammo, best weapons, medkits ) to survive.   Later you can try this again but you must be the primary source to oppose them if you want to keep Wolf alive ( who gives tasks ) until a later time where he leaves the RV.   Eventually you will have the experience and weapons to be the one heading down the road to take them on: http://i.imgur.com/54UVPEV.jpg  Hint:  you can sneak into their base unseen by going in the far south-east corner over the fence where a tree has fallen down.  Go past that to some debris near the wall by an outhouse.  Use the debris to hop upon the wall, upon the outhouse and on to the main building attic where you will find treasures inside the attic itself.  However be warned that wooden crates or capsules that you bust open often have the contents fall through the ceiling to the ground below inside the building.  You can flee the same way or drop down inside the attic access hole inside the building if you want some real action.  Also get in the habit of making manual saves ( that you name ) before you do questionable or risky actions.  Never depend on Quick or Auto Saves alone since they easily corrupt, overwrite each other and are limited in number."
stalker,3dvupz,Tejas_Stalker,9,Sun Jul 19 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is STALKER for you. A lot of actions have inevitable, although sometimes hardly noticeable consequences. Make named saves like ""1"" ""2"" ""3"" once in a while in case you want to revert. Also, just in case, the game will remain fully completable no matter what happens, so have fun!"

stalker,3dvupz,mrtrotskygrad,3,Mon Jul 20 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"Quite a few times early in the game I'd go and get a weapon from the military early on, they didn't always retaliate but it's always fun when they do.  However in my latest playthrough of SoC something odd is happening in Cordon, quite a few unusual things in a few places but in Cordon the military has been going completely nuts. I'm not sure if it's from a change I've made or just some chaos bug, I've lost count how many times I've played it and this is a first for me.  The military outpost near the town is empty as is the bridge, no guards at all, however all over the map are squads of at least 6 military and they don't stop coming. Entering from the Garage I fought two squads just past the entrance into Cordon, then turned around to gunshots because another squad was entering behind me. It's been crazy.  While I was shopping at Sidorovich suddenly there was military trying to come in through the door, big surprise when I opened it but couldn't pull out my weapon lol. Had to close the door, run up the stairs and start tossing grenades back down the stairs.  This is what my little town looks like now http://i.imgbox.com/Zsx6F8pf.jpg I've been seriously gearing up all the friendly NPCs throughout Cordon since the start, they don't take crap (they killed the mercs in about 5 seconds minus one who ran and hid) and have gone almost as crazy as the military. Every now and then they start running across the whole map going from one fight to another, for example I watched the guys that normally hang out near Fox rampage all the way to the military outpost near Sidorovich, they didn't go into it but I think that's only because everything was dead because the military isn't hanging around in bases anymore and was running up to meet them.  I'm currently in the Red Forest but that's been quiet and civil compared to the hour long mayhem I went through in Cordon just because I went to do some shopping. The military is also all over the Garage area and the heavily armed NPCs keep moving all over the place putting them down (the poor bandits don't live long in this world, they spawn and die pretty much instantly and I haven't seen even one make it into the train station since this military madness started because they get stuck between the military and NPCs rampaging around). So the Garbage is interesting but Cordon has gone mad."

stalker,3dtmar,offizierkoma,2,Sun Jul 19 11:12:54 2015 UTC,"A common game bug related to the 3 Strelok stashes is if you search any of them before they are all activated ( by unlocking the UAV ) one or more of them can become empty later after they are activated.  This means you can't get the achievement of ""A Keeper of Secrets"" from Strelok in Pripyat.  If Nitro unlocks the UAV, his sidekick Senka will leave Yanov station and be found dead next to one of the locations.  If Novikov ( at Mobile Lab ) unlocks it, it will cost more but Senka will not end up dead.  For this reason I don't mind paying more for Novilov to do it since I don't want Senka to die."
stalker,3dtmar,offizierkoma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:21:51 2015 UTC,"By the time you'll have to pick between the two, you'll surely have enough money to hand it over to Novikov anyway, and that sum comes back easily anyway."

stalker,3dwt44,moisesjsn,0,Mon Jul 20 04:41:38 2015 UTC,"Wait, so is your game crashing on vanilla or on mod start? Did you ensure you deleted all the remaining mod files in your SoC install directory, after uninstalling the game?  NLC is a huge remix mod for SoC that adds new stuff, but it's dangerously hard I hear. And also might need knowledge of Russian to enjoy fully, especially navigating backpacks and the new menu stuff. Everything is lethal, and if you play like a normal stalker game, you will die from a stray bullet, mutant, or anomaly in an instant. It can be very immersive with the right player.  I believe this guy has been playing a NLC playthrough for a while. His series is on the 25th day so far,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyAO1P444do  Solyank is the NS mod.  It's hard to recommend a mod for someone who likes NS or SGM, because those two mods are megamod cornucopias of content, and nothing really beats them. There are other mods that are perhaps better made or have ""better"" new content, but SGM and NS are kings of what they do, so you'll probably not find something that achieves it as equal or better as they do."

The reputation and faction system they cooked up should help to keep the mod from devolving into Chernobyl DayZ. If you kill other stalkers (players or NPCs), you'll piss off any factions they're friendly with, and if you do it enough then theoretically NPCs from those factions will shoot you on sight.  Of course, this doesn't mean that PvP isn't allowed, which would be boring. It just means that PvP has to make sense and can't just be mindless slaughter like DayZ became.

So many, in fact, that you can't max out the texture detail slider or else it crashes the game.  Essentially, you force the game to downscale the textures to prevent the engine from going beyond the limit it can handle.  It's still a 32-bit app, no matter how much RAM and VRAM you throw at it.  It also comes preinstalled with a horrible sweetfx configuration that I would recommend changing/removing immediately unless you really enjoy having all color washed out.  Ghost Land is not out, so you can't ""enjoy"" its black and white filter with vignette on the corners quite just yet."

It's like chambering an assault rifle with 375 magnum rifle cartridges XD   It's .50 Action Express, not .50 BMG. It's fired from a (big) handgun. Ignoring the fact that you could never make the necessary modifications to make a UMP fire .50 AE with the total lack of proper tools and facilities in the Zone, it's not far fetched at all to imagine an SMG firing .50 AE. None exist right now due solely to the fact that there doesn't begin to be enough of a market for the manufacture and sale to be viable, though the fact that such a gun would be an answer in search of a question also factors in."

First i edited the actor.ltx file to match vanilla values for hit_probability_gd_master to be .90 like vanilla master, though I'm not sure if this is a good thing since I read that it means 90% of shots will hit and 10% of your enemies/your own shots will do no damage - so maybe omit this.  Then I opened m_stalker.ltx, scrolled down to the FIRE DISPERSIONS part of the file, and for the different disps based on their stance I would put fairly high values. I think for running while standing i put the values in the 80s, for walking/standing 60s, standing still 40s, stuff like that.  I believe the variables contain ""disp_"" so you can ctrl+f that to find them, sry I can't remember the full names.

No one had bothered to make a translation for it yet; nashathedog started, I think, but it was a crappy machine translation and their editing was pretty bad for it. I think someone told nasha they were gonna start their own translation, so nasha stopped working on it, and then nothing ever happened--but I last checked this stuff out back when Into the Mist first released like a year ago, so things may be different now.  It's one of the best mods around.

stalker,3dlteq,9warbane,2,Fri Jul 17 10:34:32 2015 UTC,I had this problem on my recent play through - in my case they were already against me before I even got to the bar from the garbage (I didn't shoot any of them at the checkpoint but ho hum). Some of them will respawn (at least in stock SoC) but generally only the ones guarding the entrances from the army warehouses/wild territories and the garbage - not the other ones throughout the duty base.  One other thing to watch out for is that there is sometimes a duty guy in the bar itself leaning up against one of the far tables. You can walk in and speak to barkeep without him noticing but if you go further in that direction he will pull his gun and open fire.  If this happens or you need to go over there (e.g. to access the stash) what you can do is once you have drawn his attention then run out of the bar. I found that when I did this he would either follow you out or go into the area you can't get to but where he also wont bother you anymore.  The biggest downside of having duty against you is you can't access their store (only barkeep) or missions anymore but it doesn't have much impact on your progress if you have already moved through to the army warehouses and beyond.

Doing this increases the challenge  (your choices matter more) and the fun (surviving feels more like an accomplishment, death is more of an opportunity to get a new experience when approaching a quest again after failing the first time.).  I think Misery 2.1.1 gets a lot more criticism than it deserves. I would recommend it for people looking for another playthrough that is more challenging. The beginning may feel overly harsh, however eventually I found myself in the sweet spot after I gained enough experience and equipment. After buying an exo suit, I feel like I might have made it to the easy part, though time will tell on that. I need to go back to Pripyat, and harder parts of Zaton and Yanov to get a better feel for what the exo does."

stalker,3djt2z,AntiCitizenJuanMWO,2,Fri Jul 17 02:35:36 2015 UTC,"Misery is not artificial in my opinion. A few bodyshots will take down a lightly armored enemy. In case of guys in exo a headshot usually takes them down. I don't know how many people read the guide the MDT wrote for Misery. It says that using AP ammo is much more effective and against NPC's. In my playthrough I use exclusively AP ammo against human enemies and I can easly make profit out of every walk in the Zone. Arsenal Overhauls makes the game even easier in my opinion, because the ballistics are much more beneficial for experienced players, but the economics does not really change."
stalker,3djt2z,jeanrtt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, you might look into Misery again, as I think there was a guy that made a mod for the mod that took out a fair bit of the overly tedious crap. I never bothered with trying it, so I don't know what all it changes, but it's something you might try.  For some artificial desperation, use a weapon you know is hard to get ammo for if you don't buy it, like one of the 6.8mm rifles. Then you'll have to use some random rifle (99.7% chance to be an AK74M) you picked up while out doing whatever you were doing. Though in the end the vast majority of the time you'll just be using an AK74, sort of wasting the point of AO in the first place, which is to have a bunch of cool new weapons."

Oh, and a wild Chimera just sprinted at me from nowhere and managed to kill it after it struck me once. No radar means actually using your eyes for corpses and enemies.  I'm enjoying it.

stalker,3dj4ga,ILikeTastyBread,3,Thu Jul 16 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"GSC stated that all the devs they currently have only worked with RTSs before, so I don't think they will touch STALKER series in a while. My memory isn't quite good, but I think one of them said they can't afford making a new STALKER because the production values of modern AAA titles are ridiculously high and they are skeptic about it paying off, as the original trilogy suffered from pirating."
stalker,3dj4ga,Chocohex,3,Thu Jul 16 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"To be honest I find that a rather weak excuse coming from the makers of a game whose entire framework flew in the face of AAA title traditions. A lot of the ""expensive"" stuff in big titles is just gimmicky lowest common denominator nonsense anyway.  There are plenty of engines and game design tools available that would allow them to make a great high-end game with minimal in-house development required.   If they keep the core elements of the game unchanged, and simply continue the atmospheric theme, fascinating quests, simple but effective storytelling, and then just come up with a fresh plot, they'll end up with another solid release.  Honestly GSC wasted a lot of time and money on unimportant things. They attempted to create their own game engine rather than build upon an existing one, and it turned out to be horribly buggy. They attempted to push the boundaries of graphics with fancy rendering effects such as wet surfaces, but then neglected the most basic of anti-aliasing issues, blocky unrealistic trees, and grass that had a hilariously short render distance.  It was all so poorly compiled and optimized that even high end systems struggled to run it well at the time, and the results were nowhere near as impressive as games like crysis for instance that were able to run maxed out on identical machines with zero issues.  If they can avoid chasing the rabbit down the hole and just focus on getting it done while learning from past mistakes, there's no reason why it would need to be a high budget project."
stalker,3dj4ga,ZombieOmNom,3,Fri Jul 17 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"That's true, the reason that Shadow of Chernobyl was stuck in development hell for seven years is because GSC were simply overly ambitious, chasing the game of their own dreams without having the necessary technology or resources to make it work. A lot of people in STALKER community regard THQ as pure evil for removing a lot of content, but in reality they just pushed GSC out of developent hell and forced them to polish and finish already existing content.  The funny thing is that they did the exact opposite with Clear Sky, rushing it out a buggy, underdeveloped game with less than one year of dev time."
stalker,3dj4ga,Chocohex,2,Fri Jul 17 03:42:33 2015 UTC,"In all honesty if it wasn't for THQ we quite probably would never have even played STALKER. SoC's success paid off a lot of debt at GSC. It was a good release but even for the time the graphics were looking a little dated. They made some good changes in Clear Sky but like you say it was pretty much an alpha release.  All of their assets would be transferable to other engines for the most part. Sounds, models, textures, the whole shebang would simply require file conversion. In fact these engines would be able to support higher polygon counts and almost all the graphical effects they wanted to take advantage of with DX10.  CryEngine for example is pretty famous for it's HDR, bloom, specular, anisotropic filtering, and various special effects such as the ones it could do for water. Can you imagine the zone built around CryEngine? It would be so immersive."
stalker,3dj4ga,ZombieOmNom,2,Fri Jul 17 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"There's been a group of guys porting STALKER assets info CE, Cryzone it's called. It looked spectacular, but so does the modded SOC, for ex, Autumn Aurora 2. Ofc, CE'd allow more freedom, a powerful scripting language, and so on. You also have to redevelop RPG systems, etc.   I wonder why nobody from Russian community made a large STALKER port to a modern engine. Perhaps, it ain't that simple, meaning Xray assets are a bitch to handle elsewhere.   What do ya think?"
stalker,3dj4ga,davidstepo,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:50 2015 UTC,It's not a completely straight forward process but it's not exactly hard either. It's mostly just time consuming more than anything. For someone who does game development as a full time career it would be a piece of cake.
stalker,3dj4ga,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"True, bu the final objective itself is by no means achievable by a single person team working part-/fuil-time for free. And if you thought of assembling a team together, uniting complete strangers on the internet is even harder.  If you're aware of Arma 3 modding scene, Red Hammer Studios are one of the biggest and most organized teams ever."
stalker,3dj4ga,davidstepo,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"So, the point is, they should use something like CryEngine or Unreal Eng 4? They aren't that easy to develop in if you want something entirely huge and custom. It's probably better to know your source code instead of reading tons of others'."
stalker,3dj4ga,davidstepo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:16:41 2015 UTC,"Those are assumptions you're making, not facts. CryEngine or Unreal 4 would be perfectly capable of supporting a-life type AI and the various anomalies, while offering a more realistic destructible environment at the same time. It could add another dimension of gameplay in avoiding and manipulating the hazards of crumbling decaying environments that would fit well with the abandoned state of the zone. There really isn't anything about either of those engines that would limit ""huge and custom"". In all honesty stalker really wasn't either of those things.  The development of the xray engine started way before any of the more advanced engines became available. The project had been dragging out for a long time before SoC. By the time alternatives were available, most of the game had already been made, so xray simply became the annoying legacy code that comes with a long project. It was their decision to stick with it that really killed them. They fell into the sunk investment fallacy and no matter how much they tried to polish it they would still be pushing out a release on a way outdated engine.  Learning new code isn't the big issue here. A good game dev will learn to code with a new engine with relative ease. The crucial difference here is using a new engine is like painting with a blank canvas, whereas making something out of xray is like working on a broken old car with broken old tools."
stalker,3dj4ga,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:41 2015 UTC,It makes sense to me. I'd love to see them put out a couple of games that hearken back to their early days before jumping back in with a really ambitious project.

stalker,3dj74i,dunkybbeck,2,Thu Jul 16 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"Essentially if you have a gun that uses mags to hold the bullets you gotta need to fill the mag with the appropriate bullets. In order to do that you must put one of the mag into your artifact/detector slot. Then hit 5 (I believe) to take out the mag. Then left click and you should start putting the bullets into your mag (Of course you require the actual bullets in your inventory). Once its done (The animation will stop and the mag ""condition"" will be filled entirely green which means the mag is full. If haven't guessed the ""condition"" of the mag tells you how filled the mag is) put the filled mag back into the inventory and keep doing this for each mag you have. However there's some guns that don't require a mag in order to use the bullets, one such gun is the SKS which you would load the bullets on top and a another example is most shotguns don't use a mag but instead you put the bullets into the gun."

The NV and high contrast NATO sights started showing up on Hawaiian after getting friend of Freedom. The 2.7 sights, the target detecting PSO, and the variable NATO sight, never showed for me at all, so I just manually added them to Shulga/Loki. They might show up after you beat the game and do a lot of save scumming, but F that noise.  I never found enough of the Monolith ammo to bother with, nor have I seen it on any of the traders. If you really like using it, you might see about adding it to one of the traders, otherwise I think you might be SOL.  The 6.8mm or 7.62x39mm M4s are probably the best guns in the game. Suppresor+grenade launcher+NATO sights+non crippled damage=good. The SR3M is also pretty nice, but the garden hose trajectory and velocity annoy the shit out of me."

No luck  An so far i like the bushmaster m4 with 7.62x39mm (kinda siding with duty, so 6.8 is balls hard to get a steady supply of), and the recoil is a bit stiff. But the last recoil upgrade might fix that, i hope."
stalker,3dfk8f,Kierlak,3,Wed Jul 15 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"You have to leave it on semi auto or it's unusable, like everything bigger than 5.45/5.56. Most of the weapons have absurdly exaggerated vertical recoil, even some of the SMGs. After a while I got sick of it and went through and lowered a lot of the weapons' recoil to not feel like the Major weighs 86 pounds and has never touched a weapon before in his life. He's a hardened combat veteran. And he's Russian. No piddly little 9mm SMG is gonna have any discernible muzzle rise for him, and everything else would have WAY less muzzle rise than what is default.  Though, that's hardly a problem limited to just AO, vanilla and pretty much every other mod also has way overblown recoil."
stalker,3dfk8f,Kierlak,0,Wed Jul 15 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"actually, the recoil is WAAAY too weak, especially the random recoil over time! Someone using 5.56 wouldn't be able to keep the aim on the torso of a guy standing 10 meters away when firing full auto.  The problem with stalker is that they do not reset it after a shot, it just keeps climbing. Also you'd see a lot of horisontal recoil too, thanks to the user trying to keep recoil down.  So yeah, they're not bad actually. At least you can't go full auto sniper with every gun because there's no recoil XD"
stalker,3dfk8f,Kierlak,3,Wed Jul 15 23:24:10 2015 UTC,"Someone using 5.56 wouldn't be able to keep the aim on the torso of a guy standing 10 meters away when firing full auto.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psOpCCQdvJ4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qukk9sS4QYc  The vertical recoil is very, very overdone. Skinny college guys and girls can successfully wrestle these impossible to control monsters. There's too much vertical, and probably not enough CoF bloom."
stalker,3dfk8f,Kierlak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:23:30 2015 UTC,"okay, let's start.  The first video. You don't see the target, but that's not controlling them. During the magdump you see an up to about 5degree cone of fire. at 30 meters that's over 2,5 meters spread! Yes, he'll make the dude dead, but it's not acurate. And scaled down to 10 meters, it's still 83 centimeters. That means he's not keeping the aim on a torso at 10 meters.  Second video.  Firstly, NOT  a ""college chick"". yes she's young, but NOT a college chick. In fact the channel belongs to J-mac customs, a professional firearms part trader. And guess who's posing at the webpage! The same chick! That leads to the conclusion that 1. She is NOT a college chick 2. She is WORKING with weapons, which further leads to the conclusion that she KNOWS how to handle rifles, and thus also knows how to counter recoil. 3. watcing the video, i have to say her stance is close to spotless! It's clear she knows what she's doing.  Furthermore that's a torso figure (aproximately 70cm across), standing at arround 20-30 meters, at most. You can see that several of her rounds hit WAAAY off target, some even striking ground in front of the pole, and others hitting leaves over a meter to the sides. Thus the cone of fire is way over 2 meters. calculated down to 10 meters, that's over a meter large cone of fire. Lastly, how do you know that's not a 5.56 model? Indeed that's not a russian made AK-47, as they had WOODEN grip. That's a newer one, and those come in more calibers than the original.  In short, this is stormfire. And it proves that full auto is NOT a viable form of combat unless you're at grenade range (the range a grenade can be reliably thrown and be expected to land about where you intend to)!  Yes, stalker has a too high vertical recoil, but that's because there's no attempt to combat recoil in stalker. All goes straight up. If you were to combat recoil you'd have a massive cone of fire, even at closer ranges.  I don't know the exact data, but i know that professionally trained military personel does NOT manage to keep the 7.62x51 on target when using rapid firing semi auto AT ALL! Even the second round will likely miss!  So i'm afraid to say, but the recoil is way harder than you think.  Also, your videos just prove MY point. Thanks for that :)  edit: also, regarding second video. It's not an authentic ak, visible by; 1. the rear stock on it. The AK has a wooden stock, or a lighter all steel stock. That's a modern stock. 2. the muzle brake. The AK has no muzle brake at all 3. The frontal part of the sight. On the AK that is waaaaay at the end of the barrel, not where the gas tube meets the barrel. 4. The front grip. On the real ak-47 it stops long before the gas tube meets the barrel, on the one in the video the front grip reaches all the way to where the gas tube meets the barrel.  However it almost PERFECTLY fits the look of a modernized AK-74u! And that is chambered for cough 5.45x39. A round which is known for having VERY LITTLE recoil!  Ak-74u https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Aks74u.png  Ak-47 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/AK-47_type_II_Part_DM-ST-89-01131.jpg/1920px-AK-47_type_II_Part_DM-ST-89-01131.jpg Which one do you think is more similar to the one in the video?  Could be wrong, but i honestly doubht it. And even if i am, my original post still stands."
stalker,3dfk8f,mrtrotskygrad,3,Thu Jul 16 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"Also, your videos just prove MY point.   No, my videos prove my point: vertical recoil in Stalker is very overblown. If some ~130 pound woman that poses for pictures and works the front desk of a gun shop can control an SBR 7.62x39mm AK in full auto for 75 rounds and hit in the general vicinity of a target at 10ish meters, a full grown man that gets paid to shoot people and be a badass undercover agent should be able to do an even better job of it.  Over the top vertical recoil is not how you simulate the jitter that occurs when you are fighting muzzle rise, Cone of Fire bloom is, or if you want to be really fancy, you actually put in horizontal weapon jitter like Planetside 2.   The vertical recoil we see in Stalker is because the devs clearly had very little knowledge about weapons. They probably got to shoot a few mags through a few guns during the games development, let the guns push them around because they had zero experience in controlling one, and transferred their experiences into the game almost verbatim. They had very little idea on how weapons actually work, or how a trained user can rein in the majority of a weapon's recoil. The absurd weapon upgrade trees just back this up.   I am not saying you can laser beam 75 rounds from a drum mag all into the same hole, or even that full auto is all that viable outside of barrel rubbing range. I am saying that a trained user, like the character we are playing, would not be pushed around by his weapon like he is in this game.   It's not an authentic ak   It's an imported M92. No, it's not an 'authentic' AK, as much as anything is an authentic AK in a world where there are seventeen quadrillion variations and copies of the original Russian design, but it's close enough to use the shorthand of 'AK' and not feel bothered by it. The stock and front handguard are not going to change the recoil (that's not one of those 'kicklite' adapters you see here and there, it just allows the attachment of an AR type buffer tube to an AK receiver). It's a short barreled 7.62x39mm AK made somewhere other than Russia, with no technological upgrades or deficiencies compared to a short barreled 7.62x39mm AK made IN Russia, which means that shooting it would feel exactly like shooting a Russian short barreled 7.62x39mm weapon. There's probably a serious amount of parts interchangeability between an M92 and any other AK pattern 7.62x39mm SBR you happen to find.  Could it be chambered in something other than 7.62x39mm? It's possible, but not very likely. Changing calibers on AK pattern rifles is WAY more involved than changing them on an AR base rifle. Also the fact that it's a 75 round steel drum mag. The drum mags for 5.45 are a different design and all US made. The Russians just used 45 round box magazines for their 'RPK-74' needs, probably for cost or reliability reasons."
