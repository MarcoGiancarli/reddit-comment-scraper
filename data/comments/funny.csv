funny,3dyhlw,DeusPayne,8,Mon Jul 20 19:53:16 2015 UTC,Tabs don't always transfer well if code is moved to a different platform. And of course their is python
funny,3dyhlw,klln_u_qckly,4,Mon Jul 20 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"Fuck tabs! Some text editors interpret the tab as a 5 space block, some as a 4, some even have it set to 2!   Source code with spaces and monospace looks perfect everywhere everytime. If you're in an organization you just have to set the style guide as being 2 space tabs or whatever. Just like you have to decide as an organization to camelCase or under_score for your project  Source with tabs is at the mercy of your editors settings."
funny,3dyhlw,elneuvabtg,23,Mon Jul 20 20:06:54 2015 UTC,Isn't setting your tab key to create spaces a happy compromise?
funny,3dyhlw,thymed,12,Mon Jul 20 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"Nope, because it makes navigation using the arrows take longer. I'm really not sure of the argument for spaces. I know ppl like them, I just don't know why."
funny,3dyhlw,kannon17,9,Mon Jul 20 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"If you're navigating through spaces or tabs one by one using the arrow keys, you should learn how to navigate by word and by using the home/end keys (or the equivalent in your editor of choice), and then never do that ever again. That's like opening up a new tab in chrome and going to www.google.com to search for something: you're doing it wrong.  This is something worth noting, as well: http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015   After millennia of heated debate, mercifully, at long last, we have an answer. Most developers prefer tabs to spaces. Upon closer examination of the data, a trend emerges: Developers increasingly prefer spaces as they gain experience. Stack Overflow reputation correlates with a preference for spaces, too: users who have 10,000 rep or more prefer spaces to tabs at a ratio of 3 to 1.   I prefer spaces because I know how to use keyboard shortcuts for navigating code and completely eliminate a subset of annoying errors with alignment and perceived logic that result from people thinking that they know exactly what they're doing with tabs but really don't."

funny,3dyhlw,dcwj,1791,Mon Jul 20 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm on the GIF side of this argument (funny how the JIF sayers have to spell it JIF to get their point across isn't it?), but that's a terrible argument. By that logic, JPEG should be pronounced ""jay-feg"" because the P stands for Photographic.  Also a fun fact that I recently learned: an acronym is something that is said as a new word (eg. NASA, GIF) while something that is simply spelled out as separate letters (eg. USA, NSA) is referred to as an initialism. JPEG is kinda weird, because it's kinda both, I guess...  And before this thread devolves into a fijht to the death, everyone take a look at this thread, where everything has already been said.  TL;DR: In summary: http://i.imgur.com/q5IzNQu.jpg  EDIT:  Here are some arguments that always come up, and why I still pronounce it GIF:   Examples of words, like ""gin"" and ""gift.""    This adds nothing. The rules for hard/soft G's are not absolute.   The creator said it was pronounced like the peanut butter!   The majority of people who read the acronym clearly thought it was pronounced as a hard G, or else they wouldn't have needed correcting. Based on what the creator has been quoted saying on the topic, it sounds like the only reason he wanted it pronounced like the peanut butter was so that they could make jokes about it being like the peanut butter. Hilarious stuff. He was (is?) a programmer, not a linguist.  He created the Graphics Interchange Format. How people decide to pronounce a shortened version of the name of that format has nothing to with how its creator decides to pronounce it.  By the way, here's what CompuServe's website looks like. If someone showed you that and told you one of their programmers had an opinion on something, how much would their opinion affect yours?  EDIT 2:  This whole thing is a patently ""stupid"" argument, but I love discussing it because it still generates so much passion from both sides. I can see both sides of the argument, and I enjoy debating why I think mine is valid. But in the end, it doesn't even matter, because people will pronounce it whichever way feels right. I will stick to my guns and continue to use the hard G. Stay strong team hard G!  Also since this is getting a lot more attention than I thought it would, I would regret it if I didn't do a shameful plug of my stop motion/other videos that have absolutely nothing to do with the pronunciation of an image format."
