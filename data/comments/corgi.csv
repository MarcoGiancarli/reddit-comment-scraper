corgi,3e2nea,Shannegans,0,Tue Jul 21 16:23:33 2015 UTC,I'm from the Harrisburg area and a while ago I found a few breeders from the Lancaster area. Just look up corgi breeders or corgi puppies for sale in PA. I don't have one yet but want one very soon... they do run a little expensive 700-900 range
corgi,3e2nea,sdempsey13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:07 2015 UTC,they do run a little expensive 700-900 range   That's really not expensive for a purebred PWC anymore.
