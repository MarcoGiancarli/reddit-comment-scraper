I had removed so far one of his posts, and recognized that most of them were pretty vitriolic along with any arguments he was making.  I fully understand him being banned because of that.

The part that is wrong is when there is violence/threats and it is non stop.   I try to conduct myself in a good manner. Even on Reddit.   But also it is too easy to gang up on someone. To push away those with different opinions without discussion. That is what /r/calgary is about.  Those with a different opinion are just down voted to oblivion.   Texnorth just took that as a hostility towards him. He was ""attacked"" by a lot of people because he was not a part of the circle jerk. He would lash out in a vulgar way.   But at least he provided an alternate thought."
alberta,3e05gc,arcelohim,4,Tue Jul 21 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, my, yes, how could I have not seen the forest for the trees? TexNorth was the one being attacked! The whole reasonable world backed him up into such a corner that he had no alternative to being a complete and utter ridiculous fourteen year old, constantly and consistently. Poor guy."
alberta,3e05gc,broccolifucker,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:26:34 2015 UTC,Pretty much sums it up.
alberta,3e05gc,arcelohim,-16,Tue Jul 21 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, shall I make it more PC then? More, thin-skin friendly?  How about this.  The guy is only hostile if you approach an argument with no sources, no way to back up your statements, with a closed mind, and waving a banner only because it is the popular thing to do.  Is he aggressive in his manner of speaking, yeah, sure.  There is no doubt about that.  But when you match aggression with reason, (instead of calling someone an aggressive asshole, just sayin,) and actually target the words and what someone is saying, you can end up having a positive discourse.  So my apologies I will rephrase.  He is only hostile if you approach the situation like a moron.  Better?"
alberta,3e05gc,tehReno,16,Tue Jul 21 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"Not so. I agreed with his point probably 50% of the time, but he makes those points like an asshole regardless of the situation.  Link me to ONE. ONE. TN post where he makes his argument without calling anyone an idiot, swearing without effect (just to swear), going off about the leftists, or making a melodramatic appeal to leave the country.  The guy is objectively an asshole. Sometimes I agree with him sometimes I disagree with him, but you have to be wilfully deluding yourself to say that he is only hostile if ""you're a moron"" (which I'll take to mean trying to be offended).  No community is going to thrive when every time someone says something there are trolls waiting on the sidelines to pounce and berate people. I welcome him back to the discussion if he can act like an adult."

alberta,3e05gc,tehReno,13,Tue Jul 21 02:42:03 2015 UTC,"That is actually a great example, but let's not pretend that kind of thing is any less common than the inflammatory sort we're familiar with.  Honestly if every one of his posts were like the one you linked I would love to see him back - acting like an adult. On both /r/calgary and /r/alberta"
alberta,3e05gc,electricsandstorm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"That is, honestly, the most calm-sounding post I've ever seen from him."
alberta,3e05gc,swiftb3,7,Tue Jul 21 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, I happily sparred with texasnorth and provided well thought out responses with sources. His response was to ignore me and go after different targets. When I switched to a more John Stewart-esque way of dealing with (still good info but more sarcastic tone) him he just called me 'asshole' and then moved on. The point is real thinkers who actually could take him on were not his targets, he wanted to get people stirred up, not engage in real discussion on any point.   The guy literally had nothing to add, he just liked making people angry so he could use their anger to fuel his little rants. The fact that his topic was political doesn't change the fact that he was an outright troll who is better off relegated to the /r/metacanada where his vitrol can be accepted without questioning, and the closure of SunMedia is seen as a loss to humanity."
alberta,3e05gc,KelMage,-10,Tue Jul 21 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"he wanted to get people stirred up, not engage in real discussion on any point.   I disagree.  There have been many times where I have asked him to explain further a statement, and gotten responses WITHOUT CAPS.   The point is real thinkers who actually could take him on were not his targets   No, his targets are banner-waving rhetoric spewers of every stripe, who instead of being able to self reflect, or see things from a bit of a different angle, solidly stand on their beliefs and shit on others for having differing opinions.    If you can see that you and/or your ideology is not perfect, chances are you are not a TN target."
alberta,3e05gc,tehReno,9,Tue Jul 21 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"Damn, man, this guy really is a hero of yours, hey?"
alberta,3e05gc,broccolifucker,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:11 2015 UTC,"I actually have a fair bit of respect for him.  He sticks to his ideology, even when it is definitely not in his reddit-best interest.  I have had quite a few interesting discussions with him over the last few years.  Even in times when I disagree with what he has to say, or how he says it, I never think he or anyone deserves to be censored."
alberta,3e05gc,tehReno,0,Tue Jul 21 03:05:08 2015 UTC,I like him for his opposing views.  They are needed.
alberta,3e05gc,arcelohim,-3,Tue Jul 21 04:50:46 2015 UTC,The truth is hard to swallow for some.
alberta,3e05gc,arcelohim,4,Tue Jul 21 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you would state that, given many of you still refuse to accept that he wasn't banned because of his viewpoints but rather his attitude and the way he went about expressing his viewpoints."
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"If everybody that called me an idiot got banned from a subreddit, there would be very few people left.  His voice was just really loud.  But very entertaining."
alberta,3e05gc,arcelohim,6,Tue Jul 21 19:33:35 2015 UTC,He didn't just call people idiots. He wasn't banned for simply calling people idiots. If you're trying to make it seem as if that's the crux of the issue then you're being disingenuous.
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:48:33 2015 UTC,I understand what TN is.   He is supposed illicit emotions in people. Instead of the circle jerks.   I understand that it made people feel uncomfortable. But he wasn't doing anything illegal. Just unwelcome. In opinion and approach.
alberta,3e05gc,arcelohim,30,Tue Jul 21 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"I happily sparred with texasnorth and provided well thought out responses with sources.

alberta,3e05gc,KelMage,22,Tue Jul 21 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"I'm perfectly OK with this ban. It's one thing to have a differing opinion, it's another to actively bait other users. He's irritating as fuck and brings zero value."
alberta,3e05gc,castlite,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"I would disagree on one note: he does bring something of value to the discussions, that being an opposing viewpoint. I have to give credit where credit is due.  That having been said, its net benefit is entirely negated when it's completely wrapped in vitriol and bigotry."
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,19,Tue Jul 21 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"He's either a total troll (which seems more likely), or he needs to be medicated. His message was never all that objectionable, it's always been the tone. If nothing else, banning him reduces the workload for the mods in the sub, since all he ever accomplished was pissing people off and creating work for the mods."
alberta,3e05gc,ZanThrax,6,Tue Jul 21 00:32:05 2015 UTC,I mod at a reasonably sized sub (~50k) and I can see TexasNorth being a pretty annoying problem to have. I would guess the reports coming in on his posts probably made the mod-queue pretty challenging to stay on top of.   I do think that dissenting and diverging opinions are important but he often crossed the line and can understand wanting to remove the cause of so much extra work.
alberta,3e05gc,Tooq,17,Tue Jul 21 03:52:08 2015 UTC,"Going through his comment history,  I  really  don't  mind  the  ban  The guy's an asshole. He's not just making people uncomfortable, he's trolling, or can't comprehend how to have an open dialogue. In additon he was constantly breaking subreddit rules in the process.  I would have banned him much sooner."
alberta,3e05gc,learn2die101,5,Tue Jul 21 04:47:04 2015 UTC,Now if only /r/edmonton can follow this sub's lead!
alberta,3e05gc,RIFT-VR,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"I gave him the benefit of the doubt for a little while, but yeah, it soon became clear that he was actually a pure troll.  I have a hard time believing that he actually believes half of what he spouts.  Edit - I should mention I was raised conservative in the US, and still consider myself conservative by Canadian standards."
alberta,3e05gc,swiftb3,2,Tue Jul 21 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"I  live in the deep conservative south, this guy isn't a conservative, he's just a troll.  Okay, maybe he's a conservative, but he's a troll no doubt. We don't need that. It shouldn't be acceptable behaviour to berate others in every other post because they disagree with you."
alberta,3e05gc,learn2die101,2,Tue Jul 21 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There's conservative, and then there's cartoonish extreme conservative."
alberta,3e05gc,swiftb3,15,Tue Jul 21 22:08:28 2015 UTC,"My reasoning for using the term 'uncomfortable' was simply because I had much more colourful language and expression that I wanted to use, instead I opted to sum it up as 'uncomfortable' with the thought in the back of my mind that this would turn into a shit-show.  You can all look through TN's post history, you can read the reactions here and you can all hate ME for the ban if you wish, I was the banner, many of the other mods have asked if it should be done and I took the shot. There is conversation about TN often within mod messages, we get asked to message them to cool down, to stop hounding users, to ban based on racist comments which would be a very quick ban if it wasn't someone that posted frequently and had been using the Alberta reddits frequently. I personally liked some of the comments they made simply to get a spark in some dull local news. At a point though, the barrage of messages pertaining to one user builds up to a reaction. This isn't something that started last night.   Now that I have been called out via PM for the evening, I can say for certain that this isn't the start of some cleansing in the /r/Alberta reddit, I am not going to be gunning for anyone. If TN wants to protest the ban in a civil manner I will listen. If nothing else, this birthed a new reddit, /r/freealberta ... looks fun."
alberta,3e05gc,Sidewinder77,-5,Tue Jul 21 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"If TN broke the reddiquette fair & square and you're able to show that, imo you have nothing to worry about if anyone hates you for that.   Although I often agree with TH's general sentiment, in the past I've called on him to leave reddit if he can't follow the reddiquette. It's unfortunate he seems unable to do that."
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,5,Tue Jul 21 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"Anyone is able to show it. All you have to do is go to his comment history, close your eyes, and point anywhere on the screen. His comments are known to be hateful, which not only goes against reddiquette but his racist statements are a direct violation of /r/Alberta's rules. Anyone else but TN would have been banned long ago if they made the same comments as him. The mods had been very generous with him this far and I'm honestly surprised it took this long before the mods took action."
alberta,3e05gc,Sidewinder77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"A lot (the majority?) of /r/Alberta users are tolerant of TN's colorful style. Being subjected to that is part of free speech and living in a free society.  Again, I would emphasize that in my view if /u/TexasNorth is not willing to follow the reddiquette, he should just leave reddit. If he is ever unbanned here, I would urge everyone in the community to call him out appropriately."
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"A lot (the majority?) of /r/Alberta users are tolerant of TN's colorful style.    I disagree. I think that if that were true, his comments wouldn't be downvoted and reported en mass. The mods in /r/Calgary made over 90 actions against him in one week, which is why they banned him.    Being subjected to that is part of free speech and living in a free society.   Reddit is not a free society. There is no free speech on reddit. Even if there were, hate speech is not protected in Canada but instead is explicitly illegal.    Again, I would emphasize that in my view if /u/TexasNorth is not willing to follow the reddiquette, he should just leave reddit.   I agree, he should leave. But nobody but reddit admins can make someone ""leave"" reddit. Subreddit mods can only make him ""leave"" their respective subreddits.    If he is ever unbanned here, I would urge everyone in the community to call him out appropriately.   You don't think people have done that? People call him out every time he comments. The problem is TN isn't here for discussion. He's here to create drama. He feeds on it. If calling him out  had any actual desireable effect then we wouldn't be where we are right now."
alberta,3e05gc,Sidewinder77,0,Tue Jul 21 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"You don't think people have done that?   No, I think most people escalate the craziness instead of trying to be calm, neutral voice of reason."
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,6,Tue Jul 21 18:07:50 2015 UTC,They've tried. I've seen it on many occasions. It doesn't work.
alberta,3e05gc,broccolifucker,15,Tue Jul 21 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"The question is whether he's actually just some poor, misunderstood person with strong, albeit unpopular, beliefs, who is now being censored just for having and sharing them, or...  ...if he's actually just an ignorant fucking troll. I honestly always saw the latter."
alberta,3e05gc,Whipstock,14,Tue Jul 21 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, he went out of his way to be toxic. He could have made points in a reasonable matter; he chose to be a cunt."
alberta,3e05gc,nononoitsfine,12,Tue Jul 21 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"He's homophobic garbage and there's no reason for us to tolerate that shit in the guise of ""woaaa diversity of opinions"", so uh bye."
alberta,3e05gc,RetartedGenius,11,Tue Jul 21 01:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yes he was abrasive and pissed people off, but the result was some pretty good arguments. His trolling always brought up good points whether it was from him or the other guy. As much as I didn't appreciate the way he treats people I looked for his comments.   If I want family appropriate arguments I'll go read memes on Facebook."
alberta,3e05gc,NorseGod,5,Tue Jul 21 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between demanding ""family friendly"" comments, and requiring someone to not be straight up offensive to others. But so much of his content was laced with low-level hate speech."
alberta,3e05gc,rippppin,10,Tue Jul 21 14:07:49 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party I see.  Look. There are lots of opportunities on Reddit to post whatever you want (as long as you are not breaking laws). There are lots of opportunities to be argumentative, ignorant, abusive. However, the question is: Should /r/alberta allow all posts at the detriment of community?  The subreddit Alberta is potentially the front door for many people seeing what kind of province Alberta is. Many people may come on here (and they do) and have questions about Alberta. They may post asking a question about locations in the province, or job opportunities, or other questions related to social, economic or environment.  The question is, what kind of community should we be wanting to convey?   I would like a subreddit on Alberta where people can post whatever they want and not be attacked. Or have a post be spun into some anti-liberal tirade sidebar that has nothing to do with what they've posted.  Just recently, someone posted this:   Hello r/Alberta, east coast Canadian here... Travelling to Calgary and driving to Banff to see the sights on the first week of August. Hearing a lot about forest fires there lately. Just wondering how bad it really is? I really want to try the banff gondola and hoping I won't have to cancel!   And Texasnorth posts this:    These fires are nothing more than yet another 'unintended consequence' of feel good, liberal policies. We should be cutting forest down every 50 years - not trying to fucking save it and let it grow out of control. ...But liberal environmentalist idiots wont let us do that, because 'TEH ENVIRUNMENTS!'.....so instead we just let it burn, because that's a better alternative to hiring a company to cut the wood down and sell it to someone/somewhere. For people who claim to be so 'enlightened', and so 'educated', they sure do get a LOT of things wrong. Common sense things. Liberals have killed common sense. Congratulations, libs. No, really.    Do you think that's contributing to a community? And is it a good representation to someone outside of Alberta the kind of community this province is?  Here are some samples of previous posts from Texasnorth   OP, I don't blame you for being mentally fucked up. I blame the people who failed to intervene in your life, or the people who encouraged you to be the way that you are right now.   Another:   I would destroy that fat french bastard in a debate. And the idiot Ontario lesbian. Nutley just sits there with her stupid 'I have no idea what's going on' smirk on her face and agrees with them. :/   Another:   People like electing amateur idiots to run their government, because people are fucking stupid.   Another:   None of this 'fair weather' cycling bullshit. You people want to act like a bunch of Eurofags and pretend that we're Sweden and that cars are unnecessary? Balls in your fucking court.   Another:   This woman is fake as fuck, and we both know it. It's too bad that Albertans are mostly too fucking stupid to realize that and were duped into voting for her and her bullshit.   Another:   You know, for a bunch of people who love to claim how 'independent' they are, and how they were doing just fine on their own before all of the evil, white settlers showed up, and how much better off they'd be if whitey just left them alone - they sure do fucking love to complain about how little 'whitey' does for them and how hard done by they are. :/   Another:   Don't fucking preach to us about how we supposedly hate the environment when you useless twats are dumping hundreds of millions of litres of raw sewage directly into the fucking pacific, just because you can. Fucking hypocrites.   Another:   Here's an idea: If, for whatever reason, you favour 50%+ tax rates, maybe YOU should move your ass to fucking Sweden, or Norway, or whatever Eurofag country you liberals are touting this week as 'the government model that we need to implement to solve all of our problems.'   Another:   Everything that that fucking retard (personal attack, I don't care) said to me in his reply was either hearsay, incorrect, slanderous bullshit, or all three of those things combined. It's not that I don't love debating, or that I don't want to debate that shit for brains, but if I'm going to debate someone or something, each party has to be intellectually honest about the positions and leave their emotions and feelings out of it.   Another:   These pinko-commie fucks that moved here over the last decade from Eastern Canada voted for the NDP. They happen to reside in Alberta, but they are not ""Albertan"" - they are fucking Marxist idiots.   Another:   You think that some fat fuck health minister telling us that it's bad to smoke while she stands up there and AT LEAST 100 pounds overweight isn't hypocrisy at it's finest?   Another:   Hey genius: The liberal cock-sucking PC's didn't ban menthol cigarettes, they banned flavored cigarettes, but exempted menthol.   NOTE: This isn't actually hate speech. ""I hate ethnic slur"" is not hate speech. ""Let's kill all ethnic slur"" is hate speech. But just because it's not hate speech doesn't mean that it should be tolerated here.  People have left this subreddit as a result of texasnorth. And people will not post. It's not because they disagree with his points of view. They just don't want to participate for a number of reasons. It's not because they're pussies. Or thin skinned. They may simply have no interest in engaging in conversation at this level. And that's a HUGE loss to a community.  I understand that some people find his posts funny and like engaging in that. Realize though, you are selecting for people that are tolerant of that and enjoy that at the expense of excluding a significant group of people that have no interest in engaging at that level.   There are plenty of opportunities to engage in those communities (such as /r/metacanada). I would rather see /r/alberta a community that is much more welcoming (and one that ESL, people from other countries and youth would feel safe in participating in).   I would also suggest that perhaps it should be included in the sidebar under RULES that postings should be civil. Or, at the very least, posts should not be threatening and abusive."
alberta,3e05gc,OhthatChris,9,Tue Jul 21 19:25:49 2015 UTC,"He was a straight up Troll. The argument that his vitriolic crap should be allowed just because he's a conservative doesn't make sense. Good riddance. The sub will be better for everyone now, left and right alike."

I've seen many posts by TN, all of which were insulting people, none of which were an attempt at a constructive discussion."

alberta,3e05gc,castlite,7,Tue Jul 21 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"Here's what I don't get. If someone is an asshole in a bar, club, restaurant, store ANYWHERE in public, he gets thrown out. That's how it works and I'm glad for it. Some things you just don't do in a public place. So why the fuck is everyone all ""but muh freedoms"" here? If you behave badly, you're out. As it should be."

Sure he acts like an asshole most of the time but I think he does genuinely add some great points to the discussion from time to time and serves as a nice foil to the NDP circlejerk in this subreddit.  I understand why he was banned and I'm not going to say that I whole heartedly disagree with the decision but I'd like to believe /r/Alberta is thick skinned enough to not be upset or ""be uncomfortable"" because of the words of one single individual who most of us simply brush off as a nut job anyways. For fuck sakes we teach kids in nursery rhymes to not let the words of others get the best of us, so why a group of adults needs the policing of one user who honestly affects no one at the end of the day is beyond me.   People are saying stuff like good riddance and how much better /r/Calgary is since he was banned but was he ever seriously that bad?"
alberta,3e05gc,FoodTruckForMayor,-4,Tue Jul 21 04:24:24 2015 UTC,It's not about whether he was bad. The point is appeal to popularity by silencing dissenting voices.  Lalalalalalalala. I can't hear you.
alberta,3e05gc,nomofica,4,Tue Jul 21 05:08:59 2015 UTC,"Or because, regardless where he is on a political spectrum, hate speech is hate speech and the subreddit's sidebar says you can be banned for it.  Sometimes there are consequences for things you say or do."
alberta,3e05gc,FoodTruckForMayor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:37 2015 UTC,So why don't we ban u/karthan for promoting hate speech and for spreading the hate outside of /r/farpeoplehate? http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/389ozs/why_was_the_post_about_our_morbidly_obese_health/crttspz

alberta,3e05gc,NorseGod,0,Tue Jul 21 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"""Uncomfortable"" is a nice way for a mod to say, ""You're a racist, sexist, homophobic bigot who can't keep from calling people 'fags' like it's ok, who constantly violates basic rediquette, while spamming the subreddit with poor posts that are almost always downvoted into oblivion. And when he is asked by a mod to ""tone it down, and at least keep his language clean"" his best response is, ""don't tell me what to do modfag!""  Cite freedom of speech all you want, but this sub is not the public. You can get thrown out of a bar for consistently being an asshole to other patrons while screaming ""freedom of speech!"", and the same applies to Reddit.  And it's not even a permanent ban. He's been a temporary time out to think about whether he'd rather be offensive, our rather be able to contribute. On every other sub he's had temporary bans from, the second it's released he dumps a giant load of his personal bigotry everywhere and the ban becomes permanent.  He totally has the right to free speech. And he can go hang out with the street church crazies and express it there."

I blame the people who failed to intervene in your life, or the people who encouraged you to be the way that you are right now.   Here he is making inflammatory comments about several public officials.   Looks like Nutley is doing exactly what I expected her to: Pander to the extreme REGRESSIVE-liberals of Ontario and Q-bek while not sticking up for Alberta in any meaningful way. I would destroy that fat french bastard in a debate. And the idiot Ontario lesbian. Nutley just sits there with her stupid 'I have no idea what's going on' smirk on her face and agrees with them. :/   Rhetorical nonsense.   Liberals have killed common sense. Congratulations, libs. No, really.   Here he is calling 40.2% of the province ""fucking stupid""   People like electing amateur idiots to run their government, because people are fucking stupid.   Calling mods ""cockfags""   I can't remember which one of those cockfags was the one who banned me, so I've taken the liberty of tagging all of their names so that I can tell all of them that they're anti-free speech cowards, even if they aren't (but we all secretly know that they are.)   Claiming alberta is a ""Marxist utopia""   We don't live in a merit-based society any longer. We live in a 'needs-based' society. We are LITERALLY living the Marxist utopia of 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.' Anyone attempting to make the case that the NDP are not literally Marxists needs to pull their god damn head out of the sand.   That took maybe 5 minutes of scrolling. My point is that the guy is either trolling or intentionally trying to rile people up despite repeatedly being warned in just about every sub he frequents for being an inflammatory jerk.  So as long as you don't go around calling people mentally handicapped, openly calling politicians ""fat french bastard"", claiming that the general public is ""fucking stupid"", or calling the moderators ""cockfags"" you're probably in the clear.  I don't think I've ever seen you intentionally flame people to any degree, so there's no need to be dramatic."

Freedom of speech, or anything close to it, is the result of struggle between the rulers and ruled.  Now, we live in a world where people like you are so dumbed down as you forget the whole point of free speech in favor of removing someone because he makes other people feel ""uncomfortable"" and the desire to create ""safe zones"" which seems like a smart idea until you see the forest from the trees.  You are part of the problem, but you aren't alone.  Many are like you, blindly following the bandwagon of what seems like the obvious choice (get rid of an asshole) without seeing the larger picture (helping to create a culture of censorship).  Digg used to be open, now its not and it died as people left for reddit.  The same thing is happening to reddit now and people are leaving that for voat.co.

alberta,3dyv22,RetartedGenius,15,Mon Jul 20 17:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think you can lay that election loss squarely in the hand of Jim Prentice. He was leading in the polls by a wide margin and then he did a massive blunder after massive blunder. It was quite possibly the worst run election campaign ever.  The guy used tax payer money to do a TV spot for budget preview. In that budget preview he managed to piss off just about everyone. He has deep social services cuts with anger the progressives and unions. The cuts not being deep enough and using up the entire heritage fund pisses off the social conservatives. The end to government assisted charity pissed off the social conservatives. And if that weren't enough he pissed off the party faithful by telling them to look into the mirror for the situation we are currently in.  Even with all that he calls an election and things are looking good. The PCs were in the lead in the early days of the election with a strong challenge from the Wildrose as expected. But instead of building on his gains he just doesn't seem like a leader Albertans want at all in the polls. He was arrogant and distant. The progressives finally decide on Notley and we have a three way race going into the debates.  And this is where the election was decided. Jean came off as a tax hating robot whose only answer was that he wouldn't raise taxes even when asked unrelated questions. The Liberals were irrelevant at this point and it was here where Prentice chose his successor by literally and figuratively turning his back on the other two and only addressing Notley, whom then destroyed him at every turn. The entire debate, and the campaign really, can be summed up in the interaction where Prentice insists the NDP will raise corporate taxes to 20%, Notley tells him he is being ridiculous and Prentice says Math is Hard is some weird attempt to insult her but instead ends us making himself look the fool.  TL;DR Prentice lost that election, not Redford."

If Redford had not been such a awful politician, Prentice (who impressed me as way too honest to be a successful premier) would have never been given the chance. So Redford did not have a hand in the spring loss, but she did nothing but damage in her term in office, which was a huge contributing factor to the end of the PC dynasty. She comes off like a psychopath."
alberta,3dyv22,legitprivilege,4,Mon Jul 20 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree that she only did damage to her party when she was in power. I do think calling her a psychopath is a bit much. I think Hanlon's razor applies here. Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

If you make one stop, the Radium Hot Springs are probably a good way to relax after spending all day in the car. If you get too hot, there is a great normal-temperature outdoor pool at the Springs as well, which is usually almost empty. We stayed in Cranbrook, but didn't see any of it - apparently it is nicer to pass through Kimberley.  I have only been from Calgary to Vancouver once - that time, we went through Golden and Revelstoke. Apparently, the Revelstoke Railway Museum is quite exceptional, but it was closed when we passed through.

As a bonus you can stop by Wells Grey provincial park as you make your way down back to Vancouver.  Alternatively, if you decided to go the southern route you should probably stop off and check out Yoho National Park.

I think we're going to end up taking highway 3 from Lethbridge, then turning off on 95/93 and going up to Radium Hot Springs and on to Castle Mountain then taking the TCH west from there.  Because the 3/95/93 route looks like it is going to be 9 hours just on its own (without any stops) I doubt we will get to get more than a look at Yoho, although that will really be true for all of it - this is going to have to be a scouting road trip and we will have to come back at a later point and spend more time in areas that we liked during the upcoming trip."

To frame the deficit as money for infrastructure is not correct.  In my view the Alberta gov't is a big enough corporation to self-finance all infrastructure initiatives in advance. We would be much better off if first we save the money, then we spend it on infrastructure."
alberta,3dy4c3,J__rad,5,Mon Jul 20 18:47:24 2015 UTC,The only relevant market rate for public sector employees is how much you need to pay to attract and retain employees. What they pay in BC is irrelevant to Labour supply and demand in Alberta.
alberta,3dy4c3,Sidewinder77,0,Mon Jul 20 19:17:39 2015 UTC,Could you demonstrate that supply would not meet demand now at the lower wage levels like it did a relatively short time ago before the outcome of union negotiations arbitrarily raised wages?
alberta,3dy4c3,J__rad,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:21 2015 UTC,"I did not say that it couldn't. I said that comparisons hawked by people like the hacks at the Fraser institute are completely irrelevant to the discussion of wages in Alberta.  The only relevant information is exactly what you just tried to ask: ""are we offering the right price based on Labour supply to meet our demand.""  It doesn't matter what BC does. It doesn't matter what Ontario does. It doesn't even matter what the private sector does. These are different employers and they have a different price equilibrium."
alberta,3dy4c3,Sidewinder77,0,Mon Jul 20 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"Which Fraser Institute comparisons are you referring to?  It seems clear to me that something is wrong if that Alberta is in recession, unemployment is up, and our public sector wages are far above and beyond comparable locations and the private sector.  I would favor seeing across the board cuts until the budget is balanced. We'll just have to make due if we're unable to attract any of that high-quality public sector labor after everyone takes a haircut. It's really will be no different than what just happened to everyone in O&G. I suspect that there will be very few public sector workers that will be quitting that cannot be easily replaced."

Like, holy hell guy, aren't you capable of learning from mistakes? We tried what you are advocating, it failed miserably!  The only thing I can imagine is that you are too young to remember what the Klein era cuts did to Alberta. They royally screwed us, and they are actually one of the large reasons we are paying so much in infrastructure and public service right now.  Klein was a populist. He listened to people like you who don't understand economics or finance, and he cut everything to give the illusion of a balanced budget.  Guess what? The budget was the opposite of balanced. He didn't save shit all. He spent far more than anyone else by just deferring payments to the next government. Every dollar he spent turned into 10 dollars that have to be spent now to dig us out of a massive infrastructure and skills hole.  You have to be some special kind of stupid to want to do the same thing over again."

He listened to people like you who don't understand economics or finance, and he cut everything to give the illusion of a balanced budget.   What qualification are you presenting that makes you understand economics while I do not?  In economics it's easy to use economic evidence to support your biased view of the world. We all have bias after all. Unfortunately unlike many other areas of science, there are so many variables in the economy that it's impossible to run a truly controlled experiment and determine what is really truth in economic history. Would you recognize that fact?"

I know you self ascribed ""libertarians"" (though I like to give people the benefit of the doubt in not really understanding what they are saying when they call themselves that) dislike economists, but you'll actually find that models aren't as ridiculous as your blogs and Fraser articles suggest.  I'm not even referring to high level models or econometrics. Just a bloody basic understanding of supply and demand curves. How about not even that! Just a basic, simple ability to look at something and go ""yeah. The shit really hit the fan when we tried that one. Won't do that again"".  It is so blatantly obvious that your ideas are flawed that it gets extremely frustrating to listen to you and others like Texas north. It is extremely depressing because in Alberta, these ideas are the norm even after 44 years of constant failure.  There are models out there that work! We can run an economy well! We have the science! It is possible! All it takes is the desire to research things and actually learn before propagating objectively false ideas.  I'm not even telling you to agree with me. I have some very fiscally conservative ideas that many dislike (particularly around social programs like rent control, housing, and other subsidies). I like when people challenge me, but I don't like reading the same old tired populist garbage that is nonsensical in the extreme."
alberta,3dy4c3,57Chewie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with Sidewinder, you didn't qualify anything. You make broad sweeping generalizations with zero evidence to back it up.  You call others Stupid while providing little of value to the conversation other than ‘KLIEN BAD’. “What they pay in BC is irrelevant to Labour supply and demand in Alberta.” Of course it is, when negotiating with the public sector unions we are not dealing with ‘Attract and retain’ we are dealing with people\unions using their monopoly on critical services to bargain higher wages. It works extremely well in AB as there are times when we can afford it(not that we should). We absolutely should look at what the labour costs are in other jurisdictions not only for our own benefit but also to be fair to the other provinces. You KNOW that the other provincial unions point to AB and say look what they are paid there, that’s what we want. I don’t quite think that SW77 is correct in that it would take care of the entire deficit by paying our public sector employee’s but it would be by about half.  “The budget was the opposite of balanced. He didn't save shit all” disagree again completely, the budget was balanced, the province took in more than it spent, the definition of balanced. Now you may feel that some of the cuts left infrastructure deficits, but saying that it cost 10$ for each dollar saved is definitely misinformation and wrong. We can easily look to other places, Ontario for example to see what happens if you refuse to ever deal with your overspending.  “large reasons we are paying so much in infrastructure and public service right now.” Nope not even close, we are paying so much in infrastructure because AB has experienced a population boom that NO ONE could have predicted. Please explain what Klein cuts 9 years ago have to do with public service cost right now?  “ even after 44 years of constant failure.” Most of those 44 years, with the exception of the Klein years we ran this province with huge deficits exactly the way you are advocating.  You say that there are economic models that work that are different than our own. Please provide some examples as I hear this often, we should be like “….”, I can name many places that use a more socialist model than we do which are in far worse shape than AB.   You are just one more poster on these boards that produce these generic statements with little to back them up."

alberta,3dy4c3,J__rad,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. Labour unions go through the same process as an organized body. What they do is a variable in the supply of Labour.   The employer demands labour.   The prospective employees are the labour supply.  The equilibrium point is the price you need to offer to attract and retain labour.  A union simply shifts the demand curve.  Damn, we really need to start teaching basic economics in school."

While the cash glut into healthcare and possibly education as well as  bureaucratic nightmares throughout the Albertan government need to be reigned in, the best thing the Albertan government can do is keep the money flowing through the Albertan economy. Keep people employed in necessary projects (infrastructure) and keep them spending their money and paying taxes. The downturn only spirals worse the more Albertan's start hitting the bread lines"

Although it leads to exactly why it's terrible policy to pay infrastructure from loans.   A road is not a foundation. A road is a road. Every road costs x$ to maintain per year, however eventually you need to replace the road or do a major upgrade anyway. Generally every 20 to 30 years. That means for every 1km of road we build over our absolutely needed minimum we need to rebuild that road is 20-30 years (at around 1m/km) that means just to have that capacity existing even if never used costs a HUGE amount of money.   This is the same with hospitals and schools. (although slightly worse as they due to the way government has inefficient budgets never maintain anything they have and would always build new) every hospital today means a hospital that needs to be replaced in 20-30 years. Every school means the same thing. All at the same time we have under utilized schools being closed due to lack of attendance. Every time something like that happens it's a huge waste of long term taxpayer dollars.   Yes. If you ALREADY own a building or infrastructure it is 10x cheaper to maintain it then build new. But governments do the worst of both worlds. They don't maintain anything AND they always build new. If we don't need to build new. (especially borrowing to do so) we should not.  Basically a road should ONLY be upgraded if it is considered class E. Not D. A hospital should only be built if we absolutely need it, same with schools. And for societies sake please start maintaining our infrastructure and stop passing the buck just because the capital budget is different then the operational budget.    EDIT: this is also why Edmonton is having a major budget problem due to its mostly aged infrastructure vs places like Spruce Grove with nearly zero aged infrastructure.  If you build too much. You end up not having an infrastructure debt. But you end up with a massive infrastructure liability both are bad. And the worst part of an infrastructure liability is if you got their by using debt.

Yes everyone understands the traditional economic theory of spend in a downturn, the problem is when people insist on spending ALL the time you end up with a huge drag on the economy like the GST strictly paying for interest on loans. I believe that is far from economically healthy. Yes I understand that governments can take debentures (sp)instead of traditional loans. Yes we as a province can spend spend spend. But then in 20 years we will need another Klien to come around and cut cut cut to get us out of the mess the PCs and possibly the NDP will have gotten us into again. And frankly I don't want to live through the Klien Era again, but we as albertains did it, we created a debt free province and then now we are already wasting close to 2% of our annual income on debt AGAIN, all within a short time.

Conserving our resources and using them responsibly and prudently.  You on the other hand are a fake conservative. You have bought into the ideological garbage of the corporate socialists. Also known as neoconservatism.   Your ideology would have us waste money. You, based on blind ideology, would avoid taking on debt even if the cost of delaying spending is higher than the cost of financing the debt.  Neoconservatism is absurd.

Borrowing for operations (because that's what a 30 year road is) and putting us into debt for it is THE mainstay of neoliberalism that we see across the Western world, PCs, Wildrose, NDP and Liberals are too neoconvertaive for me.

Usually because they have totally fucked us and there is no other option.  You aren't a fiscal conservative. Fiscal conservatives want to choose the options that are the most responsible and best utilize our funds. You're just another sad sack who has bought into populist rhetoric because you don't have enough education to see through the bullshit.  Your option is less fiscally prudent and less responsible. It wastes money and necessitates expenditures later on at a much higher level.   Blind ideology takes another victim.  Also, in reference to your spending comment. Spending is not bad, nor is it fiscally conservative to blindly support cutting spending. That is more populist bullshit you have been fed. A fiscal conservative is for ensuring our resources are maximized. To do that, you need to spend on goods and services that cannot be effectively provided by the private sphere.

alberta,3dy4c3,restatic,0,Tue Jul 21 00:47:52 2015 UTC,so according to your stats 1-3% of our infrastructure is in poor condition? and you call that an infrastructure debt?
alberta,3dy4c3,Planner_Hammish,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"By definition it would be. Things need to be fixed beyond regular wear and tear. It takes money to do it. Bringing up things in fair condition also qualifies. Right now 4% of health facilities are listed as poor and 21% as fair. Takes money to bring them to good.  Moreover, infrastructure maintenance is the least likely place to see overspending because its not politically awesome (no giant scissors and ribbon cutting) for maintenance.

The place was Detroit north. It wasn't the public buildings but everything else that was squalid, crumbling or hobo-ridden. The place was mostly populated by ""massage"" parlors and crack dens.  The city of Edmonton didn't have to build any massive projects (except maybe the arena) to turn the place around and put it on track but a few regulations here, new zoning there, an airport torn down over here did the trick.  A government has it's role in promoting economic growth, it just needs to be conducted the right way."

The uncertainty is currently hurting Alberta, as well as making the NDP look like incompetent fools. The faster they clear things up (and i'm confident enough they aren't stupid enough to try to spend us out of a deficit), the faster businesses and individuals can start planning for their future.   700 million in debt costs is a very large sum, and though i'm certain a part of that is linked to good solid investment, another part of it may not be. An official budget, with everything detailed to the dollar, would be a first, and a nice change!"

I guess longer term and more stable locals such as yourself would be less hard hit than say, younger and more transient workers with less formal skills? Are the folks a bit further up the ladder getting hit as well?   Forgive my stupid question, but I've never been to Fort Mac -- is it still busy basically on construction projects comissioned a few years ago? Is the risk that it will come to a screeching halt? I'm 46, and I grew up in Saskatchewan, and you can see what happens when a boom ends in the architecture. There's a bunch of late 70s and early 80s stuff -- that dark brown brick -- and then nothing until the 00s, when the glass curtain stuff started going up... basically nothing at all in between.  Thanks for your response, by the way. Appreciate you talking the time."
alberta,3ds65b,nheddie,4,Sat Jul 18 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"Are the folks a bit further up the ladder getting hit as well?   I think many companies learned this lesson the last time around:  many gutted the expensive people, leaving only the cheap ones - who were new and inexperienced - & then found themselves unprepared when the economy picked up again.  I think this time there's an emphasis on keeping a good crew, picking up some good talent that's been left lying around, understanding the difference between cost & value.  But I don't really have any data to back that up."
alberta,3ds65b,Adjudikated,3,Sun Jul 19 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, the cost vs. value struggle. My current employer can't seem to figure that one out, and in a knowledge-based industry, no less. I blame the fact MBA's run the show."
alberta,3ds65b,Adjudikated,7,Sun Jul 19 13:35:38 2015 UTC,"Most camps are lucky to see 40% bookings whereas a lot of those same camps would need 2-3 weeks notice previously if a company would want to book in its workers.  Seismic activity is about as good as dead. Haven't heard of a single seismic project occurring outside small micro-seismic except for those in the U.S..  Drilling is pretty much non-existent, unless the producer either has left over quarterly budgets from maintenance, they are still soaking in hedged oil prices, or they've managed to sweet talk their service companies low enough to make a minimal profit.  Well servicing is slow but still going due to maintenance budgets.   Pipeline activity is slow but still kicking a bit. Kind of waiting for some of these large pipelines to get approved or LNG projects to really get going.  Facilities are going through shut down season so they're activity is hard to gauge but future expansion plans are on the back burner at least in Alberta until royalty reviews are done and investors become a bit more confident in the industry's future under a new government.  I could keep going but slowly we are seeing a reset. The companies that didn't have large cash assets or who couldn't sell enough other assets have either went bankrupt or been sold. Strange partnerships have formed to try and bundle services and keep various strategic alliances alive. Those service companies have also bent over backwards to find new  ways to shave operating expenses, so far it's allowed them to stay in the game but for how long is anyone's guess. More layoffs are still being announced but until WCS is back in the mid 60s that probably won't end."
alberta,3ds65b,Adjudikated,3,Sun Jul 19 13:44:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's really interesting. Would you say then that it's the primary discovery stuff that's mainly been hit so far? Other stuff would probably have more lag time, so they'll be finishing previously commissioned projects? These are probably dumb questions, but I've spent my whole career in agriculture and I don't know a darned thing about the energy industry, other than I like the lights to come on and my vehicle to go, so I'm all in favour of it."
alberta,3ds65b,Kaelteth,8,Sat Jul 18 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"Bah my previous response didn't post for some weird reason.  Anyways; ya it does come in waves. Exploration is by far the hardest hit so far beyond a doubt. But in some parts of Alberta you can already see it where restaurants have cut staffing levels, some hotels are dead slow (I talked to a hotel manager in eastern Alberta a few weeks ago saying if they weren't a franchise with external support outside of the community they'd probably have folded by now). So it is rippling out, its just a matter of how much it will be felt outside of the energy sector and outside the hardest hit parts of the energy sector.  With Fort McMurray, Northern BC, Hardisty, etc. as examples; they have had some huge multi-year improvement and expansion projects on the go. If they don't meet their deadlines, the permit holders will end up going through hell and back with politics and legal cricuses to try and get them re-instated. So those previous projects are carrying alot of workers right now thankfully; and again turn arounds/maintenance is always good for keeping people busy.  I think the thing that scares me the most about what is going on currently is that this time around instead of being just a typical slump like in the past; we have alot more factors in play here (major opposition to trying to get our product to market, lack of investor confidence, international market saturation, etc.); these factors aren't just causing a temporary decline in sales, its actually effecting our market share. Analysts after Q1 were predicting North America had lost somewhere in the neighborhood of up to a million barrels per day in market share alone. As any business owner knows, market share is hard enough to gain let alone try to win back. So that has me a bit worried, especially considering how much CPP depends on investment in the natural resources sector for its returns. This has the potential to negatively effect an entire generation of retirees somewhere down the line if this continues to drag out.   Maybe I'm being a bit overly cautious over this whole thing, even though I've been through 4 or 5 of these busts now; but I grew up on a ranch and I remember when the first BSE crisis hit, and I also know what beef markets are still like...I don't honestly think to this day Canadian farmers in the beef industry have regained the market share they had prior to that incident. I'd hate to see that become western canada's energy market."

alberta,3ds65b,Whipstock,4,Sun Jul 19 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"Insuring against a price drop would basically be people investing in the price, which then lost their investment.  They're likely waiting for recovery to have the money to pay it out."
alberta,3ds65b,Whipstock,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:42 2015 UTC,"Ya for private investors and smaller firms I'd reckon your right. Unfortunately it's Bank of Montreal, TD, Canadian imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank, Scotia Bank and several others who have tried to skip out on the 478 million (USD) that they owe to US producers alone (Canadian figures were never disclosed but I'd be willing to bet it's more). Now if they're claiming they don't have the money then we got a problem, because they literally hedged against something they couldn't afford. That in itself shouldn't be allowed by a financial institution."
alberta,3ds65b,ApertureMusic,2,Sun Jul 19 05:49:24 2015 UTC,"Seismic activity is about as good as dead.   This is the leading indicator of how positively the oil companies feel.  If they've ceased spending money on projects that are 1-10 years out, then they're holding capital or using it elsewhere.  Metals saw a huge decrease in exploration before the recent drop in prices."

Our first past the post system favours a two party status quo too strongly, so that these discussions keep coming up. I would welcome a system that allows the majority opinion to be represented most strongly while also allowing a wider spectrum of views to have a place.   I wish the Alberta NDP would have the guts to support on a provincial level the type of reform that their federal counterparts advocate for so strongly, even though our current flawed system gave them their power. It's a fair comparison with the NDP, since their provincial and federal branches are actually affiliated. The federal NDP want to make our next election the last 'unfair' one; lets make our last provincial election the last unfair one!"

Become very familiar with AutoCAD & also microsurvey, hire on with a survey company, get field exp before hitting the office..it will make your career & set you apart from the 80% of your future coworkers who have never been in the field, go take Instrument theory & calculation course at NAIT or elsewhere to learn how to survey, if you are lucky your company will pay for your schooling if you agree to work for them a few years afterwards.

""Women earn  65 cents for every male dollar""  Usually these statistics are misleading. There are various metrics used to measure the male-female wage gap, as shown in this research paper from 2013:  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2013347-eng.pdf  In this paper they discuss that traditionally the gap has been measured by comparing annual incomes of men and women. This does not account for the longer hours that men tend to work.  A better metric proposed is to instead compare the hourly-wages of men and women, where we find that on average women make 85% the hourly wage than men, which would draw into question this 65 cent claim. Does this mean, then, that a female engineer is making 85% the hourly wage and salary that her male counterpart might? I hope not.  Anyway, the reason I bring it up is because more often than not I find these claims to be misrepresentative. Something to think about and look into."

Focusing on the wage gap masks the problems.   The wage gap is meaningless. But that does not mean there are not issues.   As per your question I assume it has to do with strength.   Physical jobs tend to be more risky. Also being stronger may lead boys and young adults to feel more invincible. I can't get hurt because I'm faster stronger than most other people. (male teenagers especially).   Also as a 16 year old and physically able they have choice. Make $ doing x job, or $$ doing y job that is a bit riskier.  This choice then surrounds them with others who made that choice and influences what they go to post secondary for.   Or maybe less post secondary.

Does this mean, then, that a female engineer is making 85% the hourly wage and salary that her male counterpart might?   If you're looking at two individuals of same age and comparing their salaries, it doesn't seem that out of line. Women on the whole are more likely to take extended leaves. I found my employers to be very accommodate when I took leave, but there's definitely an impact in terms of experience level. (ie. a 30 year old would have 8 years experience if they graduated at 22, a 30 year old who's had two maternity leaves would have 6 years experience or a full 25% less.  A similar impact that I've seen in professional, salary based positions is the relative ability to travel and work longer hours as required by the employer. If two employees have identical performance, but one is available to make that last minute trip to a customer site or stay late to work on that presentation that just came up for the next day, the one who shows flexibility is valued higher by the employer and rewarded with greater raises, bonuses. Unfortunately, ime in a couple decades in the work force, the employee who has to run to be at daycare before it closes is disproportionally the female employee.   There are certainly employers out there that discriminate in wages, but I don't believe, nor have I seen any data that supports, that being widespread. I believe the issues l listed above are much greater potential causes of gaps in wages, and one of those is biological and the other societal. The majority of professional couples I know have made a conscious choice for one of them to step back from their career advacement while the kids are young... unfortunately in almost all cases, its the women who step back."

I now make more. Is it sexist to also base and on years worked.   Also need to factor in dangerous and physical jobs. These jobs tend to be held by men. Fewer females are able or want to lift 50kg loads all day, so as a labourer I made more than a waitress. It was also provided experience that I would lack working a service job.   I don't feel as though these stats are what we should be comparing.   Women also work fewer hours and have higher job satisfaction.

But, when something related to money like who works more overtime falls along gender lines, it certainly begs the question of why? Gender and the wage gap are complicated, and there's some reason as to why that trend exists of women not working as long of hours as men do. Not sure what it is, but would like to know."
alberta,3dlaq2,thisbitchneedsreddit,4,Fri Jul 17 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading the study correctly,  they surveyed an equal group of full time men and women, and found those averages. What we can gather from this is that there are more men on the higher end of the payscale, and less women in high-paying jobs. It's not as if they polled 2,000 surgeons and found that women make 15% less for doing the exact same job. I'm sure that type of discrimination has occurred and is probably still occurring, but again to say this happens across entire industries might be stretching the data a little. This is usually the scenario people envision when you mention a wage gap. I'm not sure this data supports that scenario. But, I'm not a professional, and that's just my interpretation.   I would imagine that women typically work less hours as there is still pressure to fulfill that gender role of motherhood. E.g. Mom picks up the kids from daycare or what have you. It is probably family related. In addition, I would think it more likely that the mother will receive guardianship of her children in the case of a divorce, so you've got to consider all of the single mothers (and the now ""unburdened"" fathers) into the equation."
alberta,3dlaq2,Incoherencel,2,Fri Jul 17 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"It is also supply and demand.  Surgeons make a lot because they are I  short supply and they are in demand.

Is it harder for a women to go to medical school? (I don't think so, but I'm not smart enough to try)"

But on further investigation it doesn't say that. It just mentions a plains mainstream leak at the bottom for no reason haha.   That being said though, the point is still valid. Greenpeace is still using this to shit on new pipeline operations when the one that leaked is one that goes from a wellhead to a larger line. It doesn't fall under the kind of scrutiny and monitoring that a larger pipeline like northern gateway would and isn't comparable."

Congrats on being wrong yet again. No, really.  The history of fire suppression is a little more complicated than that. Yes, it was prompted by conservationists, but it was largely to protect future commercial timber harvests (more of a capitalist reason than an environmental reason).  It eventually adapted into man wanting to control nature. The end of the war brought on bombers that allowed for massive suppression of fires (what else were you going to use them for?) The goal became about absolute suppression. Again, not really related to environmental practices. Some major wildfires resulted in people being concerned about safety and protecting forest reserves (for multiple reasons, aesthetically, economic and environmental).  Scientists (and environmentalists - true environmentalists that actually studied the environment) as early as the 60s started to question the obsession that federal land managers had regarding suppression of wildfires. The 70s started different methods of fire suppression with some allowance of burning.   This truly changed in 1988 with the devastating Yellowstone wildfire. I won't go into major details, but it caused a worldwide change in mentality and beliefs in wildfire suppression and suppression methods.  More recently, concepts around different ways of timber harvesting, combined with controlled burns (and allowing wildfires to burn when values are not at risk) have further changed the way fire suppression is done.  I know this is largely a U.S. history, but most of our practices followed closely the U.S. method of fire suppression. The whole history is quite fascinating. I am no expert on it, but know enough (and have only included snapshots in this post).  In short - no, so much of what you said in your post is flat out wrong. Take some time to learn about a topic before spouting your nonsense. Especially when it has NOTHING to do with what OP posted."

alberta,3djkqb,OnlyFactsNoContext,2,Fri Jul 17 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"I thought your solution was to let it burn?   Here's an idea! Maybe we should let some of these bloody fires actually burn for once! We've gone out of our way to put out every fire over the last 100 years, and all it's done is lead to larger, more intense wildfires! Do you know why? Because mother nature needs to renew herself and burn out all of the old chaff so that it can regenerate. And what do we do? We put the fire out. There's so much dead and rotting fuel in these forests now solely because our idiot government has such ""good intentions"" and thinks they can control mother nature.   https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/378gx6/provincewide_fire_ban_in_effect/crko992  YOU have destroyed common sense.  Congratulations, shitlord.  No, really."
alberta,3djkqb,Kaelteth,5,Thu Jul 16 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"He's not entirely incorrect, eh.  Forest fires are one of those things that happen naturally, getting rid of the deadfall, undergrowth, and most insect infestations in swift, short burns that forests can heal from quickly.  But we started preventing forest fires, and as a result the deadfall, undergrowth, and insects accumulate until a fire comes through and has so much fuel, it just destroys everything.  If I could find it online, I'd show you a National Geographic fold-out that goes into much better detail on why longer times between fires result in more destructive fires."
alberta,3djkqb,OnlyFactsNoContext,3,Thu Jul 16 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"He's not entirely incorrect, eh   He's entirely correct.

One moment it's ""Let it burn"", the next it's ""the magic of the free market can fix it, just let people log"", not knowing that so much of this area is just fucking inaccessible.  He's not wrong about letting shit burn to rejuvenate, and is why I never called him out for being an idiot in that thread.

There should at the very least be a check on that and getting them to smarten up.

alberta,3dlmbj,bawbzilla,12,Fri Jul 17 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"The answer is simple:  Don't like him?  Ignore him.  If he never receives a single upvote or downvote, or a response to any of his comments, then he would go away.  But we engage him, so he comes back.  There's absolutely no need to ban him.  Hell, with RES you can make it so you never see his posts, if that makes you feel better.  Personally, I'd rather hear what he has to say, whether I agree or not, and whether he's an asshole or not, because I'd rather be exposed to other ideas than to stick my head in the sand.  We don't have a duty to protect his voice...but YOU can choose not to listen.  We don't need Reddit protecting us from the fact he's an ass."
alberta,3dlmbj,Kaelteth,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Ignoring people has sincerely never been an effective tactic on online communities. Mods saying ""Stop being an asshole or we'll ban you"" has. A community that wants to foster engaging, mature discussion on a topic would do well to police a certain, minimum level of behavior.  Right wing voices in this sub are important, but people only have a problem with one of them. Why is that, and why is it so terrible a thing to suggest they get their shit together?"
alberta,3dlmbj,bawbzilla,8,Fri Jul 17 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don't give a shit that he's an asshole.  It doesn't bother me, and I don't need the mods protecting me from assholes."

I'm admittedly a fan of great satire and don't think that should be excluded from a community that wants to foster mature, engaging, and creative conversations about a topic, but I don't believe that's what TN is doing. It's just plainly crude, mean, and off-putting."
alberta,3dlmbj,bawbzilla,6,Fri Jul 17 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, I think TN would be much more effective in promoting his ideas if he left out the assholeness.  I think he destroys his argument here by being a twat - people don't give the idea a chance because of the way it is presented.  But that's his problem, not mine.  I don't give two fucks if everyone hates him and ignores his message because he presents it like a moron.  I just don't need to be protected from the assholeness.  That's the difference.  I don't get my panties in a knot because he's a douchebag.  I don't want to go crying to the mods for the fact he offends some people.  I'm more than capable of handling TN's bullshit myself thankyouverymuch."

I don't know why you'd insist on viewing it in that way.  It's about getting an offensive and rude person to change their behavior and to drop the white noise posts that approach ""SOCIALISM BAD YOU'RE AN IDIOT"", to better the discourse and community in this subreddit. It's about not poisoning the discourse with low effort posts full of insults and name calling, so that mature, intellectual, and creative discussions with all viewpoints can be had."

You aren't required to care about the online communities you're a part of, but I'd suggest deferring things like this to the people who do. TN can believe whatever they want and say whatever they want... elsewhere. We don't have any requirement to let them be shitty in our clubhouse, and it isn't censorship to make them behave like an adult or kick them out.  Better discourse about Alberta wide things can be had in r/edmonton and r/calgary, and both actually spank their users for being shitty and AFAIK both had given TN plenty of warnings to sharpen up before banning them. If I wanted to have a serious discussion about Alberta politics, would I go to the place where people are expected to respectfully interact or to the place where a weirdo screaming about the sky falling because of socialism and the gay agenda is going to flood the comment section?"

alberta,3dlmbj,Kaelteth,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:39:01 2015 UTC,I am just making a guess on your preference based off of past conversations. You are the one who keeps asking for tits. Nothing has made you happy yet. I only made the natural assumption humans didn't do it for you. I don't judge. Whatever floats your boat.  Another species perhaps?
alberta,3dlmbj,Ashlir,0,Fri Jul 17 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"Well, since you seem to fail to understand the message...  Your (usual, not this) post is always complaining about the system, without ever giving a single idea on fixing or changing the system.  I get that you don't like it (and bluntly, I think the system needs work as well), but it is bluntly easy to rail off on how everything is wrong, and hard to provide ideas on how to make things better.  I keep giving you ""Tits or GTFO"" as my statement that you need to provide some fucking ideas instead of just hating everything.  But in this thread, I'm really just being facetious."
alberta,3dlmbj,Kaelteth,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:54:04 2015 UTC,Oh I have received the message loud and clear before now. You just haven't been paying attention. I think there should be a multitude of decentralized options without any one size fits all solutions based on force of the vocal minority. But your dense socialist education can't see a solution that doesn't require centralized force on peaceful people who have a different opinion or want to try other options. If the the best answer you can come up with is steal from those who don't want it so I can have what I think they should pay for. I don't have to have all the answers because we haven't had a chance to try all the options. We can talk about history all we want but history does not have modern technology. Systems that were built for the horse and buggy are not relevant in today's world. They fight hard to make themselves relevant through propaganda and fear of the next boogeyman.

alberta,3dlmbj,Loire55,4,Fri Jul 17 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"And what YOU don't seem to understand is that statement is about the worth of a pile of shit.  It's the same tired railing off without anything specific that you want changed or how it could be implemented.  It is a basic statement that the system is broken because you hate it, and provides nothing on how your Utopian society should operate.   You need to offer specific ideas, not grand sweeping statements on how everything is wrong.  To give an example, I believe first past the post voting systems are fundamentally broken, and results in a minority of people electing a majority controlling force, with prime examples being the NDP victory in Alberta, and the last PC victories in Canada.  I personally believe that, despite the challenges, an instant-run-off voting system allows people to cast a ballot in a ranked fashion, giving all political viewpoints an opportunity to take seats in the governing body, but also allowing people the opportunity to actively state ""Well, if my first choice candidate gets eliminated, then my second choice is xxxx"", which would empower voters to take additional control over their vote, and ultimately encourage voter participation.  Another example - I believe that recall legislation is required, so that an individual member of government or an overall party can have an election forced on them if some percentage of the voting population presents a valid petition calling for the recall.  This will enhance our direct involvement in the representative government model we currently have, and protect the people from a government that gets elected and fails to follow the will of the people.  These are ideas, not ramblings.  Tits or GTFO Ashlir."
alberta,3dlmbj,Kaelteth,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:26:32 2015 UTC,You keep assuming that we have to work in the exact same framework with the exact same easily manipulated system designed to only keep itself going. That we need a collective centralized system in the first place. I think if you want a communist or socialist or what ever system that you and anyone who wants to voluntarily be apart of your experiment then they should be able to opt out of playing with the current broken tool kit. Like you keep on insisting has to be the case.  Your only option ever given is the same option we are not allowed to be without now.   Your path is to legitimize a broken system. That's the only option statists know and are willing to give any thought too. You really should investigate the current school systems inception and design. It was created to limit the debatable choices to that of the vocal minorty. 40% of the population already have figured out the game is rigged and don't bother voting. So from here on out every government is a vocal minority.   The true majority is none of the above.

Nothing he says is illegal, but just because he represents an alternative viewpoint doesn't mean he should be given license to treat everyone like crap.

As I've said to you time and time again, this is the system of Government that exists until it is replaced by something else.  Bitch all you want about it, but we are a world ""state"" that is governed by a rule of law.  Work to change the system (or abolish the system) if that is your desire, but otherwise bitching about the existence of a system does nothing to accomplish any goal you state to have.  So, to now answer your question, if the House of Commons, Senate, and 2/3 of Canadian provinces representing a minimum of 50% of the population of Canada ratified a constitutional amendment to make energy resource transportation a provincial authority as opposed to a federal authority, then the law of Canada would be changed, rightly or wrongly (and I would personally feel wrongly) to make this the law of the land.  Whether you identify this way or not, you're an anarchist ""Freeman on the Land"" like individual that believes the government has, or should have, no power over you.  And despite your thoughts, when you CHOOSE to live within the boundaries of an existing world state, then you are CHOOSING to abide by the laws of said state until such time as you can work to change, abolish, or overthrow said state.

Check the link below out.  Also by Health and Safety regulations you have a right to refuse unsafe work.

If the pallets are being delivered regularly I'd imagine a pallet jack or fork lift is probably already on your company's grocery list.

alberta,3demqm,broccolifucker,3,Fri Jul 17 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Could you give us a bit more information? What kind of material is on the pallet and how is it secured? Why would lifting one end of a pallet and dragging it be a repetitive and common task? Why is one foot the magic height, are you lifting the edge onto something a foot up, and if so, why?  If you're just lifting one end together, then you're not lifting the weight of the pallet, halfish rather, but there just isn't nearly enough information to begin to understand this task. I've been in industry here for a long time and with a better understanding I'm leaning towards it probably being stupid to do whatever you're doing, but also know that there could be specific situations where it's reasonable.  Either way, though, you always have the right obligation to refuse unsafe work. Unsafe can mean several things, it may be directly unsafe to do, and probably illegal, in which case it's upon the company to rectify it with the proper equipment or gear, or it may be unsafe because you're not properly trained or qualified to do it. If you bring something up and it is actually safe but you need to be taught how or certified to do so, and then you receive that training, then refusal can be terms for dismissal, but this specific case is so strange. Honestly, to echo what others have said, why the fuck is your company dealing with 400 lbs of material on a pallet without using a forklift or bobcat? I'd love to know more, because this sounds pretty peculiar, but honestly nobody can tell you with such a strange, vague description.  Edit: reading it over again, trying really hard to imagine even a stretch of the imagination, I'm not sure there's really any case. It's on a pallet.

They should decrease the amount of time given to companies to abandon wells after they've stopped producing. This would help keep the boys busier and make sure this stuff isn't being left too long.
alberta,3ddcil,Brett686,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"I know it's not super time sensitive, but don't these wells have to be abandoned properly after a set amount of time?"
alberta,3ddcil,Adjudikated,3,Wed Jul 15 17:14:12 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm not an expert but this is how its always been explained to me.  For every well drilled they (the Company who owns the well) basically need to abandon two holes or abandon x amount of holes per year based on their prior drilling activity of previous years. This has in the past ensured that most companies can meet their abandonment obligation while still ensuring that they meet the 3 or 5 year timeline (depending on the region) of beginning the abandonment process of a non-producing well.    This is a great system in theory because the costs of abandonment can be factored into the new well development. So the better a Company is doing, the more wells it can abandon. In the end it also forms into reducing operational expenditures, still promotes the industry to continually improve operational efficiency and even boils down to an increased work load for service companies (ie. the Service Rig companies as mentioned by other redditors). However where it falls short is times like we're (Western Canada) facing currently, where the the price of oil and gas is in the shitter and to avoid going into the red Companies aren't drilling. Instead their operational budgets are going strictly into well maintenance (which rarely includes in well abandonment). If the information I've been told is true that would relieve some of their obligation to abandon as many wells (since they aren't developing more so they aren't as abandoning as many), even if they're still paying into the overall fund....if that makes sense.   However I could have been fed some misinformation too, so who knows."
alberta,3ddcil,greenknight,-4,Wed Jul 15 17:41:33 2015 UTC,Yes and no.  The companies delay reclamation with several dirty tricks and accounting for decades on these old wells where the reclamation costs are beyond the companies will to reclaim.
alberta,3ddcil,notanalter,6,Wed Jul 15 17:35:41 2015 UTC,Reclamation isn't the same as abandonment.
alberta,3ddcil,greenknight,-6,Wed Jul 15 21:06:55 2015 UTC,Quite the opposite actually.  If they actually had the will to reclaim the messes they have created then the sites wouldn't be on the books and wouldn't be abandoned.
alberta,3ddcil,notanalter,3,Wed Jul 15 21:47:50 2015 UTC,lol what? No.
alberta,3ddcil,greenknight,-6,Wed Jul 15 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"No?  There is 50000 sites non in production awaiting reclamation. (Down from a 150000, which is good).  The majority of sites scratched off the backlog were recent gas wells that aren't as dirty.  The remainder are the expensive and impossible to reclaim.  Many of those will end up on the abandoned well list."
alberta,3ddcil,notanalter,3,Wed Jul 15 22:08:01 2015 UTC,"The point remains, abandonment is not reclamation and vice versa. You simply want to push your agenda, that is quite obviously anti oil."
alberta,3ddcil,greenknight,0,Wed Jul 15 22:38:39 2015 UTC,Fuck no!  I worked in the industry for a few years.  In reclamation actually.  I just happen to know that older sites are dirtier and more expensive to clean up and the government at the time allowed them to put off reclamation nearly indefinitely.
alberta,3ddcil,greenknight,-2,Wed Jul 15 22:58:24 2015 UTC,Lol. They had no interest in committing money when it is flowing either.
alberta,3ddcil,Alacritous,2,Wed Jul 15 17:38:18 2015 UTC,I'd love to have an abandoned well on my property. Just hook up to the casing and pipe off the remaining gas coming out of the hole. They'll have anywhere from 0 to upwards of 50 psi pressure on the casing. Just stick a dessicator on it and run it through a filter to get rid of any residual h2s and you've got free heat for a hundred years. At normal home consumption rates.

""What is truly disturbing is not so much the NDP's principles, but their reluctance to share them with Canadians and to be open and honest about their true ambitions."" This implies the NDP has something to hide, yet doesn't elaborate on what. And finally ""Unfortunately, for the NDP, this age of darkness and ignorance is coming to an end.""

If Alberta had nationalized (provincialized?) the oilsands, we would have been able to get a lot more of it before the oil price crash, rather than getting some measly royalties and a bunch of temporary jobs for easterners.

alberta,3dcm7v,Dabookitty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"i meant whats the point of having an insurance plan that isn't offered,   Please reword that...that statement does not make sense.  If something is not offered it is not part of the plan...simple as that.   or is unreasonably expensive   Because it is a HIGH RISK!  The more likely something is to happen the more you have to pay to protect yourself from is happening.  Example:  Earthquake Insurance.  In BC is is very expensive with very high deductibles.  10% of total loss for the deductible and can easily be hundreds of dollars.  Here in Alberta if you want it you can get it for a 3-5% deductible and and maybe $60/year.  All goes with where you are more likely to have a loss.  Like how farms and Acrages pay 2-4 times the amount of insurance as a city home...due to lack of Fire Protection.  If people see the value of and the need for the insurance they will do what it takes to get the coverage.  I had a client take the $4800 in additional home insurance for overland Water last week...he was hit in 2013.  No one said insurance had to be cheap.  If the coverage is offered it is offered at the price it is offered at."
alberta,3dcm7v,tehReno,0,Thu Jul 16 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"That does not change what I said...it is not part of a policy, but has to be purchased seprately."
alberta,3dcm7v,Dabookitty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:49:05 2015 UTC,It does change in that it was not available until June 2015 and only available to certian clients of 1 company.  For the majority of Albertans it was not and is not an option.  So it can not be purchased separately...yet.
alberta,3dcm7v,tehReno,0,Thu Jul 16 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"So you are going to tell me that if I had a bucketload of money, and I went to my insurance company and said, ""I want to get overland flooding insurance,"" that they are not going to get me covered, before last month.  They are going to say, ""No sir, we can not offer you that, so please take your big bucket of money and leave,"" or would they find a way to get me that overland flooding insurance."

Until June 4, 2015 there was NEVER an option in Canada under personal insurance to get any kind of Overland Water Coverage Period!!  It was available under Commerical Policies though.   They are going to say, ""No sir, we can not offer you that, so please take your big bucket of money and leave,""    YES!  If the product is not available...it is not available.  Remember 9-11-2001?  Know what became an exclusion after that?  Terrorism.  It was never excluded from insurance before...now you can not buy insurance for terrorism at all...it is not available.  If you are not insured with Aviva Canada right now you have no option in this country to even purchase Overland Water Insurance today.  EDIT:  I have been in the insurance industry now for a decade...This is what I do day in and day out...Insurance."

alberta,3dcm7v,rippppin,4,Thu Jul 16 18:16:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I've ever seen someone so consistently get upset about things that they have no clue about.  Isn't there enough stuff you can find to be mad about on things you may actually have some knowledge about?  Here is information regarding the Disaster Recovery Program in Alberta. As tehReno correctly states (as he is not ignorant on this topic), the DRP covers uninsurable damage and loss. And it has to be considered a disaster, not simple flooding due to rain.  And only essential items are covered. Here, read the application for Homeowners and Tenants. You can read about some of the items that are covered and some of the items that aren't covered. Arguably, you can complain about what is considered ""essential"" and what is not considered ""essential."" But at least do so in some enlightened manner."
alberta,3dcm7v,the_alberta_way,5,Wed Jul 15 11:27:33 2015 UTC,"I think what he's arguing is more high level and ideology based. Should taxpayers cover losses from natural disasters for other taxpayers? I'm inclined to agree that I don't want to. Maybe once, but after that I think the risk should be on the individual and their insurer if applicable"
alberta,3dcm7v,rippppin,0,Wed Jul 15 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"I have two problems with your post:  First, 'overland' flood insurance IS certainly available in Alberta.  Just because it is an 'unaffordable' seperate policy does not mean that it's not available.  That's like saying that new Ferrari's are 'unavailable' to purchase in Canada.  No, they certainly do sell Ferrari's in Canada - for a price, and just because you and I can't afford one does not mean that they do not exist.    Second, your liberal term of the word 'disaster' is disturbing to me.  I mean, really?  A few hundred homes that were flooded with a couple of feet of water AT WORST is now a 'disaster'?  ""OH NOEZ!  My exotic hardwood floor is ruined!  It's a total disaster up in hurr!""  A provincial 'disaster' should not encompass INCHES of rainwater in TENS of homes.  We should save that term and only use it during, I don't know, actual disasters?  Tornadoes, loss of life, large scale terrorist attacks, LARGE scale environmental problems - those kinds of things.    These people in Chestermere failed in a very substantive way to ensure that they were personally responsible to themselves, and that's not my problem.  Sorrynotsorry about your luck, Chestermere.  If we start classifying a few hours of hard rain as a 'disaster', literally everything that happened would be a disaster.    It was too hot out today.  DISASTER.  It was too cold out today.  DISASTER.  It was neither hot nor cold, but incredibly humid outside today.  DISASTER.  Seriously.  :/"
alberta,3dcm7v,Dabookitty,4,Wed Jul 15 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, no. I don't have a ""liberal"" term for disaster. I'm saying that the province has a definition of disaster. You're bitching about a newspaper article and complaining that you, as a taxpayer, shouldn't have to pay for things that, in reality, you won't have to pay for. I'm trying to educate you on the Disaster Recovery Program.  A disaster is defined, under the program, as ""... rainfall has been at least at a one in 25 year level in urban areas or a one in 50 year level in rural areas, it is considered extraordinary.""  That's what a disaster is. It's not a little heat. It's not a little rain. The municipality is asking the province to investigate to see if this event fits the criteria established by the program (which is absolutely something the municipality should do). Then there will be a process to see what is covered and what isn't covered. Yet you still bitch and complain about your hard earned money and taxes being spent on a hypothetical situation that you created in your head.  Also realize, they are talking to people at a very difficult time. And now they are dealing with insurance (which can be hell) and trying to understand a process. They are having journalists misquote and misinterpret what they are saying, or even quoting them out of context.  EDIT: Oh, and you keep bringing up the subject of hardwood floors. This is a lesson in comprehension. The individuals complaint regarding the hardwood is not asking for compensation from the government. In fact, the only statement from a homeowner asking for government assistance is   “We’re just screwed. I realize it was a freak storm, but there needs to be some sort of help,” van Ree said. “I’m hoping if the insurance isn’t going to help us out that there will be government relief, or something.”"
alberta,3dcm7v,rippppin,-4,Wed Jul 15 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"Several inches of water in tens of homes constitutes a 'disaster' - yes or no?  This is a personal opinion question, not one of 'can I shoehorn it to fit some obscure government definition of what is, or is not a disaster.'  Also realize that none of the circumstances that you've posted were caused due to my own fault, nor should they ultimately be my responsibility.    Also explain how you've come to the conclusion that the taxpayers will not ultimatly be on the hook for any of this AFTER the government has concluded that it fits their shallow definition of what is a disaster.  Can't WAIT to hear this one."
alberta,3dcm7v,rippppin,3,Wed Jul 15 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"Several inches of water in tens of homes constitutes a 'disaster' - yes or no?    Yes.  Great damage was caused.  Fits definition.  It is not a matter of personal opinion.  A lot of damage was caused.  A few inches of water in a house can make the home a total loss.  So 1 Flooded neighbourhood...yes that is a disaster.  Unless you think writing off a neighbourhood of $300k-$500k houses is just something minor.  And that does not count all the other costs...that is just the structures...all the property, additional living expenses.  You are okay with throwing people on street within nothing?  Because that is what you are advocating!    Oh sorry natural disaster hit you...oh that can't be covered by insurance...sucks to be you.  You lost your house and most of what you own...and have a mortgage and no home to show for it...  Well aren't you a kind hearted person."
alberta,3dcm7v,Dabookitty,3,Wed Jul 15 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I know you won't address the other statement I made, so I will address what you wrote.  I don't know if it constitutes a disaster. I don't pertain to be an expert in that field. That's why there are criteria established by the Government to determine if it's a disaster or not (it's not an opinion question). That's why there are funds set aside so entire communities aren't wiped out when a disaster occurs. And as a taxpayer, you have some protection if, for some reason, disaster happens to strike you. It's not much protection (seriously, the DRP does not even come close to covering everything), but it definitely provides support for those in serious need. If that is something you don't believe in, feel free to move away from Alberta. Honestly, that's a small price to pay for ensuring some of the basic needs are met for true disasters (again, not a little bit of heat and a little bit of rain).  And once again, you misinform. Do you do it out of ignorance or just to be an asshole. Estimates are 300 homes affected by flood. Read the full article. Again, comprehension is important.  Honestly, I hope nothing happens to you and your family. But if something were to happen, you may have a very different perspective on life if a tornado, major wildfire or flood was to affect you and those you love (assuming you have someone other than yourself that you love)."
alberta,3dcm7v,Dubhead1169,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:31 2015 UTC,I'll do that as soon as you point out the homeowner in the article asking for taxpayers to pay for their hardwood floors.
alberta,3dcm7v,Dabookitty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"First you are not in the insurance industry...you are not an expert, so stop pretending.  I have multiple provincal licenses and have been in the industry for over 10 years and have watched it develop over that time.   First, 'overland' flood insurance IS certainly available in Alberta   Only Through Aviva...and only Since June.  Most people do not have the option for that coverage.  The majority of Albertans don't even know it is available.  This is the first time in Canadian History that Overland Water coverage has even been offered.    dis·as·ter/dəˈzastər/  noun  a sudden event, such as an accident or a natural catastrophe, that causes great damage or loss of life.    There is no liberal definition...that is the actual definition.  Flood that causes great damage...yes is a disaster.  Period.  If you need a copy of a dictionary so you can look up the meanings of word I will send you one.   These people in Chestermere failed in a very substantive way to ensure that they were personally responsible to themselves, and that's not my problem.   The majority of residents never had the option to insure against the flood.  And it is your problem now...like it or not.  Don't like it...just leave and go some where that the legislation is more to your liking...you are the minority.  We hear you...but don't have to do anything you say.

alberta,3dcm7v,NorseGod,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:01 2015 UTC,"....And why is it the taxpayers responsibility to 'compensate' you because your house flooded due to an act of nature?    Because up until June 2015 there was no option to even buy insurance against such an event.   If you insurance policy doesn't cover the total damages that you've incurred, PERHAPS you should have investigated and paid for a better insurance policy that would have   You do not know how insurance actually works...that is okay...I am here to advise you.  Only 1 Company in Canada offers the coverage currently...and only since June.  Most people who are not insured with Aviva would have no clue the coverage was available elsewhere...ontop of not even having an option to buy it.  Before June 2015 it was literally impossible to get Overland water Insurance.   It is not MY fucking job as a taxpayer in Alberta to pay for YOUR hardwood floor repair because it rained. So fuck off.    It is your responsiblity to help your fellow Albertan.  Yuo benefit from my taxes...I benefit fromt yours.  Disaster relief is part of that.

And it's not just me, my father went back to work for the first time in six months yesterday, my brother still hasn't, and most of my friends are still sitting. It's not fun.

I'm not personally aware of any of those concerned who claimed that their office doors would be shut down the next day or that head offices would be shut down in the days/weeks post election.  Back at election time, when my NDP supporter friends were pushing that any comments against the new government were fear mongering, my response was that we wouldn't really be able to see any real impact for 12 to 18 months.  I'm sticking with that, although I will concur with the opinion that while the NDP didn't create the current economic issues, they did make it worse, however nominally."

We won't honestly see the consequences (good or bad) of their policy changes for quite a while other than butt hurt oil companies leaving the province, but in reality, that is a result of bad planning on the part of the conservatives for not diversifying investments and subsidies in alternative energies.

You people don't understand what debt is. Would you rather take a $50 loan that costs you another $10 in interest to replace your sump pump, or would you rather pay thousands to fix your basement after it floods?

Don't buy the lies from hacks like Jack Mintz. Infrastructure deficits are a real thing, you can read the engineering reports yourself. An infrastructure deficit is when you delay or cancel maintenance or upgrades needed to your infrastructure.  You still aren't making any sense.

(right when we had zero debt we had an EXTRA 20% to spend on infrastructure compared to everyone else because we were not paying interest, that adds up FAST)   If we want the infrastructure we need to get the Revenue NOT borrow. If we can Keep the advantage of Interest in = interest out i'm happy. but it looks unlikely that we can even come close to maintaining that.   If the NDP do their jobs rights... we can however there is hope that we can get rid of the debt again.... its a faint hope but it's there.. i just hope we don't have to wait until 2019 to kick the NDP out to start on our path to financial recovery."
alberta,3d9zch,stimmer,4,Wed Jul 15 05:34:14 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that infrastructure does not generate economic activity in the province? Use debt to build a road that allows someone to build a new factory. That factory could easily generate economic activity that far exceeds the interest rate on the loan. Let's take a more personal example. You have 10k of debt at 5% and 10 sitting in a checking account. Sure, you could go and pay off the debt and be `in the black'. Or you could go invest it in indexed funds and make, in the long run, 8% off it. Which sounds better? This is a common situation on /r/personalfinance. This is what the government does with investing in infrastructure instead of paying off debt."
alberta,3d9zch,Himser,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:42:52 2015 UTC,If we still had the Heritage and Sustainability funds bringing in interest income you would be right. However our debt load will far surpass those at our current spending rate. That is far from sustainable. Yes you can use debt funded infrastructure to improve the economy. but interest payments on that debt hurt the economy in the long run if you never pay it off. (see the 36B/y in gst federally)   Especially as most infrastructure only lasts 20-40 years before it needs to be replaced and you end up in a cycle of debt as a government that is extremely hard to get out of.

The Alberta Advantage has to be much more than just bragging about zero debt, it must also include appropriate spending on infrastructure in order to grow the province. Withholding such expenditures in the name of balancing the budget is a recipe for stagnation in an ever changing world."

We are behind on new schools, roads, hospitals!  The Misericordia Hospital in Edmonton is quite literally falling apart and the city is in desparate need of some new hospitals.    We have schools bursting at the seems with students as we are falling more and more behind.  Many schools are nearing or far surpassed their life span and are in need of major upgrades and repairs, or for some just replacement.  That is the infrastructure deficit they are talking about.    We need to take on debt to get this work done NOW not later.  If we keep putting it off and off it will just end up costing even more.  We have plenty of example of this...the 23rd Ave overpass on Calgary Trail in Edmonton is a perfect example.

And this year it's going to cost $1 billion. But because of resources and a shifting economy, it's going to cost you $3 billion in three years."
alberta,3d9zch,J__rad,4,Tue Jul 14 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"No, debt is a tool. It is used to save money in the long run. It allows for targeted spending and flexibility.  You use it for things ranging from credit cards to home mortgages.  The government uses it for things like building roads.  Question for you: what makes more sense? Taking out a $50 loan that will end up costing you $10 more in interest to pay for a plumber to fix your sump pump, or spending nothing and then having to pay $500 to replace floor tiles when your basement floods?  How about this: spend $50 million on a loan that will end up costing $10 million in interest to fix a bridge, or pay $500 million to build a new bridge and pay out victims when it collapses?  You simpletons just don't understand what debt is, or how it is used. Debt is not deficit. Holding debt does not mean you are in an operational deficit. In fact, refusing to use debt often puts you in an operational deficit."

While I agree with you that debt can be good, and I don't have any problem with government bringing on good debt, I don't love these examples. They are too binary. In the first case, an even better option would've been to budget properly so that you have $50 to spend when the sump pump goes. In the second, it is possible that a better option is to increase taxation or cut other spending to put that $50 million into the bridge without taking out debt."
alberta,3d9zch,J__rad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that increasing revenue and properly budgeting in the first place are both superior options. Unfortunately the PCs shit the bed on that for 40 years straight.   My personal favourite way of funding infrastructure is a complete P3 with toll collection. Bid the project out as a land right of way. Private company comes in and builds the project on their own dime, then collects tolls for its lifespan at a profit. Zero risk for the government, zero public tax dollars invested. Even better, only people who use the infrastructure pays for it - benefit principle stands.  However, we at in Alberta in 2015. People here LOATHE the idea of tolls for some bizarre reason (reality check - you have to pay for it either way, but this way you don't pay for things you don't use), and we have a 26B infrastructure deficit. The only option we have right now is debt financing, or we ARE going to face much higher costs as a result."
alberta,3d9zch,aardvarkious,2,Wed Jul 15 04:55:12 2015 UTC,Why is the public paying a profit margin to a private company for as long as the project is used superior to the public paying a small amount of interest over a decade or so of financing?
alberta,3d9zch,J__rad,0,Wed Jul 15 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"Risk transfer. The real benefit of P3 projects is risk transfer. Eliminate the risk of closure, maintenance, failure, and in the case of toll roads revenue. The private company assumes all risk in these projects in exchange for profit.  It is also much more conducive to budgeting."
alberta,3d9zch,aardvarkious,2,Wed Jul 15 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"The risks of closure, maintenance and failure are all quite minimal if the engineers do their job right and are actually listened to. On the scale of an entire province enough projects are undertaken that a disaster on one isn't going to cause a significant problem to the system as a whole.   Even under P3, taxpayers are paying for all of those things anyways. I would rather pay directly for then than paying a private company which will take a healthy profit margin on top of the costs of them.  And your budgeting concerns are the same: if the engineers and civic planners do their jobs correctly and are actually listened to, the long term costs are pretty predictable. Real risk and budgeting issues are only introduced when politicians get more concerned about re-election than governance and so favour short terms savings over proper long term management."
alberta,3d9zch,J__rad,0,Wed Jul 15 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, the risk of closure, maintenance, and operation are all 100%. In a p3, the private firm calculates the estimated closure days in the contract. If they go over, they are fined. They also pay for the maintenance and the operation, so there is no risk of overrun."

alberta,3d9zch,rippppin,2,Tue Jul 14 19:07:31 2015 UTC,"It's not a new TV. Let's look at what happened since 1993 to 2013 (20 years).  Alberta's population went from 2.5 million to 3.8 million.  But let's see how that was distributed around the province.   Calgary went from a population of 725,000 to more than 1.1 million. Edmonton went from 625,000 to 817,000   Those are some pretty big jumps, but nothing compared to the following (just to highlight a few):   Grande Prairie went from 28,271 to 55,032 Canmore went from 6,600 to 12,300 Cochrane went from 5,800 to 18,750 Okotoks went from 7,400 to 26,300   And the structure of the cities changed drastically. The populations have shifted into new areas in Calgary and Edmonton.   Here's what Wikipedia has to say about Klein:    ""The repayment of the debt was one of the most significant long-term goals of Klein's premiership. During Klein's austerity campaign, the ""Klein Revolution"", or The Alberta Advantage, as Klein called it, Klein slashed government spending by deep cuts – more than 20 per cent – in public spending[5] resulting in massive job losses in the public sector. His government took a knife to funding for arts and health programs, going so far as to demolish hospitals, laying off thousands of nurses, and selling off the provincial public telephone company, AGT to private interests.[22] Without necessary infrastructure, Alberta was unprepared for the boom times.[23]   That last sentence is an understatement. We are far behind in regards to infrastructure for this shifting population in the province. There are some ignorant people on here talking about how we are robbing from the future generation. We already robbed from them to pay off a debt. It's time we start reinvesting in the future by building schools and hospitals and other infrastructure in areas of the province where they are needed.   I'm not sure if the NDP are doing it properly, but I can guarantee that last thing we need is Klein mentality at this time.   You obviously were not born or you are unaware of the short and long-term effects of the Klein era."
alberta,3d9zch,Rageagainsttheleftie,4,Tue Jul 14 19:53:15 2015 UTC,"With population increases come tax increases because there is more taxpayers allowing more expenditures.   Wikipedia is a source but not foolproof because as they say : "" the winners write the history books"". Having said that, yes the Klein government dropped the ball on what to do after the debt was paid. We had a glorious opportunity to create the best province the world had ever seen if they had done things right as you say building infrastructure for the coming boom with cash in the bank. But alas we got Stelmach and ...  I'm totally up on these ages and from a time where we paid for things as we could instead of trying to have everything at once with monies owed to the bankers. I see the argument to build things for future gains using debt, I simply disagree."

If growth goes up 5% the associated costs of that growth don't stay the same or go up just 5%; the costs of growth increase faster. You need new growth to cover the costs of old growth. Why? There's a reverse economy of scale involved.   Just one example is waste water treatment. A small town can get away with a sewage lagoon, but if the town grows or an industry moves in, it has to upgrade to a far more expensive system .

And yes, I can agree to debt the sewage plant, but at a set term at a set amount to be surcharged to the users until it is paid, than removing that surcharge not keeping it there to build art work for it, or hire more people to sit there, drink lattes, and discuss what a fine sewage plant they built.

PERIOD  Anyone who says otherwise is selling you swampland.  Schools, firehalls, hospitals, sewers, bigger transportation corridors, water lines, public buildings to house, Heath/social workers/inspectors, flood control, arenas, community halls etc. etc.. Surcharges for all of that plus more eh?  You think you know, but you don't. You pose as reasonable but it is not based on factual understanding.  It's soooo simple - surcharges for everything. Rural Alberta would die a horrible economic death if they had surcharges as you suggest."

The 19th street overpass in Edmonton IIRC ball parked around 200 mill, that's just one of many around Alberta, then there are new bridges...  Hell culverts under county roads past my quarter are coming in at 6-10 grand and off the top of my head I count three. Extrapolate that out.

alberta,3d9zch,aardvarkious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:58 2015 UTC,"So in other words, you are ok with government debt. But you think it should only be used for specific projects, and a surcharge should be charged to the users of that project until it is repaid.  This is a great idea in theory. But in reality, it doesn't work so good. First of all, it doesn't let you plan for the future: then you can only build projects that have enough current users to pay the surcharge instead of thinking through how many people will use it in the future. This is also very inefficient- it costs money to keep track of those projects and administer surcharges. It is way more efficient for the government to centrally take out debt and then finance projects from a central pool."

Only the super rich could even afford to buy a house.  And for governments...The Southern Alberta Floods.  What was the government supposed to do?  Nothing and just let thousands of Albertans to be homeless with nothing but whatever they could save from their homes?  It was a flood and not covered by insurance.    Or the Fires in Sask?  They used up their budget already and summer is not over yet.  Oh sorry there is a wildfire but we have no money left...sorry.

It is approval for him to spend up to $6 billion dollars running the programs already laid out in previous budgets and the Interim Supply Bill. He may or may not use any of it (last year, up to $7 billion in borrowing was approved but we posted a surplus)"

Similar to a personal Mortgage the government can also borrow money to build needed infrastructure and pay it back over time...thus making it easier to meet their other requirements.  If they could not finance infrasturcture through debt...very little would be able to be done.  Oh need a new hosiptal...we we could borrow the money get it built in a few years and benifit from is sooner and pay back the money...or save up for a number of years and create an even larger problem and care deficit as we wait for the money to be saved to build it...or take it out of somewhere else.  Need a new Hospital...just slash Education for a year.    You keep saying debt is bad...but offer no solutions how to get things done without using debt.  Just saying to increase taxes does not solve the problem.   6 billion dollar blank cheques to do with as government sees fit without any details is just not smart.    That is where you argument falls flat.  These aren't blank checks.  Infrastructure costs a lot.  We need to borrow to do it...there is no way around it.     Unseen disasters are covered with contingency funds   Really?  So all that debt we took on for the Floods...that made it impossible to balance the budget...right it all came out of the contingency fund so there shoult never have been any new debt for it right?  Yes we have Contingency fund...which as of Dec 2014 was sitting at around $3 Billion her in Alberta.    Debt is absolutely necessary for any modern developed economy to work."

Worst of all, you're an extreme-fundamentalist that believes that this platform exists for you to shout your ideals. And this is why you should fuck off from this site.  Reddit is a forum for discussion. And an extreme-fundamentalist refuses to discuss. A discussion is a multi-way conversation where one party listens to the other party (a dialogue) to exchange ideas. Like all extreme-fundamentalists, you refuse to acknowledge the existence of anything outside your beliefs. There is no exchange. Opinions are facts. And anyone that disagrees with you is automatically wrong. And when you're proven wrong, you simply walk away and find some other place to shout your bullshit.  Let me provide some analogies. You're like an extreme-fundamental Christian that says they love religion. And one that participates in threads by stating that the Jews killed Jesus. That Muslims want war and should be shot. That the earth is just a little over 4,000 years old. And any information that counters any of those points, they refuse to acknowledge (such as the similarities between the Quran, the bible and the Talmud).  Or you're the extreme-fundamentalist womyn who goes into any thread and shouts how all sex is rape.  Or you're the extreme-fundamentalist who says they love the environment who shouts on the corner about how Alberta is murdering trees, with no understanding (and refusal to understand) the difference between an old-growth rain forest and a taiga (or boreal) forest.  I don't mind someone who's ignorant. There are those that have no interest in politics, and they are ignorant of politics. They couldn't care less about knowing who is Premier or Prime Minister. That's fine. Not everyone is interested in every topic. But these people don't participate in political threads and discussion.  And I don't mind fundamentalists that live in their own little sheltered world and shout and nod their heads with other people that believe the same things.  You (and those like you) are cancers to discussion. You derail. You shout. You piss off people. You state wrong information that misleads. You nitpick. You insult. And you refuse to learn, or listen, or use any sort of critical thinking. And then you leave, looking for the next discussion, or posting an irrelevant item. And the thing that drives me fucking crazy is you think you're informed, educated, and doing this wonderful service by providing an alternate viewpoint.

At the time when I look at it, it was 3,262.01 per capita, and it really doesn't sound like much in that sense.  Hell, we are carrying that much debt to pay for our schools, hospitals, support services, infrastructure, etc when you can't even get a decent car for that much.    That's half of a year's worth of a rent for one cheap room in a house in the cities.  I'm not dumb enough to think this could actually happen, but what if we all suddenly remembered that we are the government.   It's not some other entity, some faceless corporation - We are Alberta. That debt is ours. What if we all got together and paid off this debt?    Amortized over 1 year at 5% (roughly 3% prime rate plus a wild ass guess of 2% to cover the increase in debt till it's paid off) that's about $280/mo.  Lots of people scraping by couldn't afford that, but I would bet that there would be a surprising chunk of the population that could.  What about over 3 years?  just under $100/mo, now that's more affordable.  5 years?  $62/mo - that's the cost of a cheap phone plan these days!  Just a thought exercise."

There is no optimal level.   If we reach Greek debt levels   Okay,...enough with Greece that is a completely different issue and you are purposefully ignoring all the other factors that make it completely different then Alberta.

They've lost their teeth, and they desperately need them back.  Part of the reason NDP is in is because most of the unions backed the NDP in a desperate bid to stop losing ground."
alberta,3davro,MechaCanadaII,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:12:29 2015 UTC,Just like in BC? When the unions backed the ndp in bc what happened? They got elected in. When the trade unions wanted what was promised what happened. The were told to take a long walk off a short pier.
alberta,3davro,dacian420,3,Thu Jul 16 03:52:17 2015 UTC,Quite possibly.  We will see what actually happens here in Alberta.
alberta,3davro,The_Nameless_Mist,0,Thu Jul 16 03:53:26 2015 UTC,I will admit that we needed a change. The wild rose grass roots was a great idea until you dug deep enough to reveal the money that pushed certain agendas. The liberals have been to scattered to put up a fight. The PC's have been disappointment after disappointment since Klein. The NDP's track record of leaving provinces bent and broken and pennyless is growing. The choices were grim as to give the power of this economic powerhouse of a province too.
alberta,3d3fro,Legendairylukef,7,Mon Jul 13 05:24:07 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions, yes and yes.  Almost all small towns across Canada have volunteer fire departments and they are generally screaming for new recruits.  The caveat though is that you need to live within close proximity to these towns so you can respond to calls. They will not accept you if you cannot respond to calls in a timely manner. Some may also assist with getting your EMR or EMT, but most of the training will be to slowly attain your NFPA 1001 qualification."
alberta,3d3fro,Beardedtacofish,4,Mon Jul 13 05:56:39 2015 UTC,Apparently something like 95%+ of firefighters are volunteer. Pretty much only big cities have much for paid staff.
alberta,3d3fro,iwasnotarobot,3,Mon Jul 13 07:07:21 2015 UTC,"Almost every department everywhere aside from the large municipalities are volunteer-based. You are required to live and/or work in their area of service and must volunteer X amount of hours per month to training and maintenance of equipment and facilities (can't just go to the few calls once in a while).  You must attend training and earn your NFPA 1001 certification (basic firefighter qualification) before you are permitted to work the fireground.   I have to ask, why get your medic cert only to volunteer? It takes a lot of time (minimum 3.5 years) and money to get and keep your cert. Do you plan on also having a paid medic position with another service?"
alberta,3d3fro,nomofica,2,Mon Jul 13 08:07:29 2015 UTC,"Fort Saskatchewan and Gibbons do. The Fort technically calls them ""part-time"" firefighters."

alberta,3d60qk,no_malis,-9,Mon Jul 13 20:37:17 2015 UTC,People that did not necessarily vote for this debt will be forced to pay it back some day. That doesn't seem very democratic.

Maybe it is needed to upkeep our infrastructure and avoid paying more when it completely crumbles? Maybe maybe maybe...  But that wasn't even my point, I was simply stating that the article in question makes no effort whatsoever to put things in perspective. Is this a lot of debt we are putting on? How does this compare to Alberta's past? To other provinces? What is the money earmarked for? What are the limitations on its use?  Basically it's very bad journalism, and even though it's coming from a lobby group they could have at least made an effort to hide it. I'm neither pro nor anti NDP and I strongly disagree with some of their plans, but I just think this sort of rabble rousing is pathetic."

alberta,3d60qk,no_malis,-8,Mon Jul 13 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"No, making whatever excuse that is fashionable at the time to justify debt in order to fund an excessive public sector is what got Greece to where they are now. And at the heart, this is was what your last comment was all about.   We are a rich developed country.

But I guess you just hear ""debt"" and everything goes red?   We are a rich developed country. We do not need to take on public debt to find prosperity, and our political system passes debt payments onto others in an immoral way.   Yup.

alberta,3d60qk,Dabookitty,6,Mon Jul 13 21:45:22 2015 UTC,"Debt is immoral? Do you have a mortgage? That wouldn't be lead to the ""disenfranchisement"" of your children?   The fact is all the big companies and nations carry debt. Most people carry debt. There is good debt and bad debt - and to know which kind we are talking about in Alberta's case we need a lot more information than is being presented."
alberta,3d60qk,Dabookitty,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"The mortgage example is really invalid. A mortgage is actually usually also an investment for self and family. The government can't sell a bridge or hospital, it's just a depreciating asset.   Yes, there is good and bad debt, and debt taken on with no direct goals or repayment strategy, as our overlords are doing, is bad debt. If the article piques your interest you can certainly seek more info, they made a point and left the rest up to you."

alberta,3d60qk,Rageagainsttheleftie,-2,Tue Jul 14 05:08:13 2015 UTC,"Private actors take on relatively small debt loads on behalf of share and bondholders that have voluntarily sanctioned that borrowing. In the public sector politicians have no skin in the game. The can borrow money to buy votes, ruin the finances of future generations, and be long gone by the time problems appear. Similar to what is now happening in Greece."
alberta,3d60qk,stimmer,2,Tue Jul 14 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"And Government take on debt on behalf is exactly what they are supposed to do.  They take it on the behest of the voters...and voters are like shareholders.  They borrow money for roads, hospitals, schools, emergencies, etc.  There by building the province for those future generations.      Long gone by the time problems appear?  Looking back at just Alberta...that is definately not true.  Greece has more then just a debt/spending problem."
alberta,3d60qk,Rageagainsttheleftie,2,Tue Jul 14 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"So you are completely ignoring the facts and just making your opinion from thin air?     We are a rich developed country   Very true   We do not need to take on public debt to find prosperity   100% utter Bullshit.  Without Debt and Financing we could not complete any major projects within a reasonable amount of time.  And as we all know...Emergencies happen.  Without any debt...what would have had the Alberta government do about the Southern Alberta Floods and all those people who lost everything and because it was a overland water...no Insurance.  You want the government to tell the citizens...""Sorry we can not help you because we can not take on any debt, fend for yourselves.""    Or how like Saskachewan has already for exceeded their fire fighting budget for the year...need to take on debt.  You can not just stop fighting forest fires just because there you ran out budget money.  Thankfully that is not how a Rich and Modern country like Canada works.   We should simply act morally and right, always and forever.    And Responsible debt management is part of that.  And always will be.  You can not budget for everything.  Your arguments against debt is bad and just wrong."
alberta,3d60qk,Dabookitty,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:20 2015 UTC,WHOA!! There is a lot more wrong with Greece then deficit spending.  Like a government that did not collect taxes...and tax payers not paying.  If you are even going to try to make a comparison between Alberta Debt and Greece Debt...you need to step back and really understand more about the problem then just the Debt.  You example is horrible and flawed...and is not even compariable.  But nice try with fear mongering!
alberta,3d60qk,Dabookitty,4,Tue Jul 14 18:42:35 2015 UTC,The other side of it is...those that did not necessarily vote for cuts that would directly impact them would have had them imposed upon them then and those here today suffer.    There is no simple solution.
alberta,3d60qk,Dabookitty,-3,Mon Jul 13 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"We are rich. At $10's of thousands of dollars of disposable income for the typical Albertan family, we can afford to pay higher taxes now. If we want to finance more public spending now we should raise taxes now. It's the simple and obvious solution. There's no need to pass today's spending onto future disenfranchised voters."

I pay over 50% of my income on various levels of taxes and user fees, any more taxes and I may have to go on welfare than you'll get nothing.   Here's a novel idea; trim some spending to pay for any more public spending. Debt must be repaid and those debt payments plus interest equals yet less money for public spending. So borrow yet more ?"

Please give me that deal that turns 10k into 70k, I'll take a million of them ! Are you saying a civil structure will have compounding value ? Yes, but you can't just build it and garner the rewards.

Which means 50% of people make less then that and 50% make more.  The average Albertan makes about $60000 year.  Of course that includes everyone...from the very very rich to those making Minimum wage and part time.   If we want to finance more public spending now we should raise taxes now.   Thus creating even less disposible income for ALL Alberta families.  Now the higher Corporate taxes, and on the higher income earners...sure tax them more.   There's no need to pass today's spending onto future disenfranchised voters   Financing and Debt used responsibly are good for the economy and everyone in general.  Major projects would never get the green light if they could not be financed.    Those future voters are not disenfranchised at all...they will be directly benefiting from the investments made today.  With the new schools, roads, hospitals, these eventual new voters are being born in, educated in, benefitting from the spending and debt of thier parents and grandparents.    Debt is necessary."

We would have a more just society if did no permit this sort of action against future generations of taxpayers.   If current taxpayers feel so strongly that they need to go into debt, they should all be assigned a proportion of the debt, and they should have to pay back though higher taxes in the future or from their estate upon their death. New voters that turn 18 or new Canadians that come here in future years should not be obliged to meet the interest payments of this years debt nor pay down the principle."

Generating more revenue, to maintain or improve the quality of life for albertans in times of prosperity is what I'm talking about. Believe me, if they start making it difficult on the oil and gas industry to operate here I'll be the first to line up and heave them to the side in four years. But nothing they've campaigned on, and nothing they've proposed has done anything of the sort. The Alberta economy will recover or not at the mercy of the price of Oil. Until we see the specifics of what is actually borrowed, as opposed to the cap on borrowing it's premature to judge."
alberta,3d60qk,Dabookitty,-2,Tue Jul 14 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"I should have said, reign in the growth of spending. Spending will go up now and then it will go up when there's a recovery, and the debt is unlikely to be paid back by a government like this one until there is a crisis."

Exhibitions like the Stampede have a long history of displaying indigenous people as if they were zoo animals or cavemen in a natural history museum. Things have improved a lot and I suspect today's native participants have more say in how they are presented and are therefore likely to approve of the Stampede's ""Indian Village"" but I'm sure there are others who oppose it. You walk a fine line when presenting cultural traditions at such a venue and care should be taken not to represent today's indigenous people as a historical relic. All cultures involved have changed quite a bit since the days of the Old West which we celebrate at Stampede."

alberta,3d164n,megalarb,4,Sun Jul 12 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"A few others have already had some pretty good answers to this, but here's my explanation for why I asked:  I think it's necessary to know how important cultural groups feel about their representation in a world-famous event because I think it would have a large impact on their relationship with people outside of their local communities. They probably want that representation to be positive, and the only way I could know if that's the case is by asking these questions. If they have a negative opinion about it I would like to know why so that I can try to educate myself about their culture in a positive light. I think that's important because of a simple human thing called 'compassion', try it some time.  If you're going to immediately drag politics into this, I think it's safe to say that a good relationship with Native communities would have a positive effect in making agreements with leaders of Native reserves. A good way to do that is to make sure that Natives are represented in a way that they feel is appropriate and projects a positive image of themselves, which I also wouldn't know unless I asked these questions. Let's be honest, we've really fucked them over as a culture in general, there's no denying that. Fixing that involves understanding these things, and I'm not sure why you don't see that as being important regardless of your political stance. Or is it because your political stance involves the idea ""yeah, let's just keep fucking them over anyway""?"
alberta,3d164n,elktamer,3,Mon Jul 13 06:23:18 2015 UTC,so that I can try to educate myself about their culture in a positive light   Have you ever gone to a pow wow? You might get better answers there.

The fact of the matter is that because we've never really tried libertarianism, we don't know if it ultimately works or not.  We don't know that because people are generally chicken-shit cowards who aren't responsible to themselves and want the government to do everything for them."
alberta,3d6exf,redditmoose,3,Thu Jul 16 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"The same argument is made that there has never been a government that has failed that is based on pure communism. Or pure socialism. Or pure Liberalism. They don't exist.  You're like a first-year engineering student arguing that a perpetual motion machine works with a frictionless sphere in a vacuum.   And yes, there are chicken-shit cowards who aren't responsible to take care of themselves. In the same way there are asshole individuals that will exploit and marginalize their workforce and their surroundings for pure profit at all costs. In the same way there are philanthropists that will provide assistance to those in need. In the same way there are ethical entrepreneurs that believe in developing technologies that will further our understanding and well being.  It's almost as if you need some sort of blended system that allows for freedom, but has protections built into the system as well.   Take your first-year philosophical ideology and shove them up your ass."

And firearms... are you calling the Biggest issue that got Harper elected a red herring and arguably the REASON Harper is in power today?  Of course it's important. The NDP are stupid if they think any rural people will vote for them if they want to restrict firearms further. Many of the firearms owners absolutely hate Harper right now due to C-51...

Classic ""I got mine"" attitude, and it stems from not being educated in law or economic theory.  The vehicle regulations you mentioned are due to something called ""externalities"". These are instances when the use of your property negatively impacts the use of other people's property.   You don't have the right to do whatever you want with your property. You never have, and you never will. You have the right to use your property in a way that does not negatively impact the rights of other people to use and enjoyment of their property.  This isn't the ""Nanny state"". It is just a law set up to stop assholes from doing douchey, assholeish things that harm others."
alberta,3cvyuz,J__rad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"Lol I know what externalities are and I have absolutely zero problems with proper regulations and costs associated with externalities, (carbon taxes and whatnot) as long as the system is fair. What I do have the problem is the whole ""instead of regulating something because most people are responsible we will ban it"" nanny stateism that is popular with NDP supporters.   On the property rights I would much prefer a government that leans on the side of liberty then on the side of control. Yes I know anarchy is not a feasible system but if the NDP took all their admittedly good intentions on the group rights side of things and transferred those to the personal liberties side of things they would be in power as we speak."

Check out the CANATICS vehicle insurance industry group that the top 8 or 10 car insurers have formed to fight insurance fraud.  The level of analytical sophistication is outstanding, and it would be legal even pre C51.  Check out what Avigilon is doing on the video analytics side.  Folks fighting C51 think they are so sophisticated and ""with it""  As for personal liberty, I refer back to the cited article.  The NDP is a party that supports keeping people on a tight leash, at least a liquor laws are concerned.  Canada, and Alberta, has some of the most personal liberty defying liquor laws in the free world.  Externalities are one thing, over reach is another"

This NDP surge (dubbed the ""Orange Crush"" by the media, after the soft drink) was mirrored by a collapse in support for the Bloc Québécois in Quebec, and a collapse of support for the Liberals nationally as the progressive non-Conservative vote coalesced around the NDP."

They prefer to build either completely segregated bike and pedestrian paths with shorter effective distances than the roads they compliment, or completely integrated pedestrian/bike/car paths in low traffic residential areas.  The experiment that Calgary is doing won't be sustainable. Edmonton has recently learned a similar lesson with its bike lanes."

For instance that Alberta has almost tripled in population in the same time period isn't mentioned. Nor that the workers, such as the LPNs were paid near minimum wage back in the 80s and have since unionized and now have industry standard rates of compensation. And these are good things because now the doctors, nurses and other medical professionals that we train in out universities are actually staying in Alberta and working here rather than being poached by an American headhunter.   tl;dr only looking at the what without the why paints a poor picture of what is really happening."

I don't think Prentice's proposed cuts were an unreasonable first step, and a knee jerk reversal without a review of potential areas for efficiency  was the wrong move, IMO.  I think we should be looking outside of Canada and the US for a model that works better for today's society. Some level of privatization could take some of the pinch off health care systems.   The Author's proposal to increase the focus on preventative healthcare is a good one, but it's not a panacea and unlikely, imo, to be a significant enough change to right the ship."

Americans for instance actually pay more tax dollars per capita into health care than Canadians.  We need to overhaul our system (get physicians off piecemeal billing, introduce team based care, centralize service, use more nurses instead of docs, shift spending to preventative care etc), but privatisation is not and never will be the answer."
alberta,3csovy,JeffBoner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"Team based care has existed for a while and is increasing. The problem has been lack of funding. Primary care networks are employing nutritionists, physiotherapists and nurse practitioners to help better manage what services are needed for patients. This is leading to lower costs and better patient attention."
alberta,3csovy,J__rad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"No, team based care does not exist in Alberta. There are currently three pilot projects (slave lake, east Edmonton, and east Calgary), but they are not fully team based care clinics (they still have some piecemeal billing).  A team based care clinic is a centralized health care centre in which physicians operate on a salary basis in the same building as other physicians including GPs and specialists, as well as nurses and other medical practitioners that share the workload.  A PCN is also not a team based care centre. It is an organization of physicians that can share patients and pool specializations. It utilizes the same billing framework as private physician offices.  Where did you hear that team based clinics have existed for a while? That is completely false.  Also, the problem is not at all a lack of funding. Redford tried to spend millions on setting up clinics. The problem is the physicians. The AMA categorically rejected team based clinics because they change the billing structure so it can't be manipulated for high pay/low work, and they give a higher role to RNs. Completely the fault of the physicians here that we don't have real team based care."
alberta,3csovy,JeffBoner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"You are saying the definition of team based care is for physicians to be on salary. From who? AHS? In this scenario does AHS also have to pay for the building, staff, and overhead? And at the same time approximate the current fee for service profit (aka salary) the physician previously earned? I think any physician would take this deal. Make the same money, no startup costs, no operating risk or costs, no clinic management headaches. If you're against any of those then it likely means you're actually just wanting the physicians to make less. If that's the case then just say it, and good luck. Nobody wants to or will willingly take a pay cut without a good reason."
alberta,3csovy,J__rad,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:53:31 2015 UTC,"No, that is a portion of what team-based care entails. Team based care is a system in which patients have access to a range of physicians who share patient loads and are flexible in cooperative care. The piecemeal system invalidates this happening. You literally cannot have an effective team based system on piecemeal pay.  In this scenario, AHS would indeed pay the overhead, and salaries.    I think any physician would take this deal.   Didn't happen. AMA fought hard against the team based system. Redford budgeted millions to start them up, and the AMA revolted.   The piecemeal system allows physicians to manipulate the system with ""patient mills"". Not all physicians do this, but many do. The team based care system also requires people to do things like after hours work, and allow RNs to take over work.  It does not mean ""less pay"" for the average physician. It means that less scrupulous physicians that operate patient mills would no longer be able to do so."

alberta,3csovy,JeffBoner,6,Fri Jul 17 00:07:06 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with privatization of our system further. As it stands health care is for the large part privately managed and paid for with public money. The main issue is that we have very little information on how the services are being managed - physicians and clinics have very little obligation to report on how they manage their practice. The solution is more public, transparent oversight, not less."
alberta,3csovy,JcakSnigelton,2,Fri Jul 10 17:11:35 2015 UTC,"It's also important not to let physicians off of the hook in the equation. The Alberta Medical Association has fiercely lobbied for physician rights to be private corporations (PCs); and, for higher fee scales. For any free-market fanatics out there, this is the equivalent of labour union negotiations, only the AMA carries far more weight (and capital) than any trade union. Next, these professional corporations (i.e., physicians) who contract their services, both clinical and administrative, to the public health service, are then put in places where they are entirely responsible for driving health care costs (e.g., building hospitals, buying equipment, increasing services) while they themselves are completely and utterly unaccountable to the public system, because they are each private corporations.  Their incentives are to bill the public system as much as possible for infrastructure so that PCs can see as many patients as possible in order to bill the public system for as much as it will bear. So far, Alberta governments have been willing to give them blank cheque.  The reality is, Alberta's physicians and surgeons make too much money and are in charge of a system for which they are not accountable. If Minister Hoffman wants to control spending, she will need to freeze contracts, begin eliminating PCs from positions of public administration, hire docs as employees of the public system, and pay them reasonable salaries (e.g., around $250k/yr, instead of $475k/yr).  tl;dr Physicians who are private corporations make terrible public administrators."
alberta,3csovy,JeffBoner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"100% agree. The Alberta Liberals actually had a policy on their platform called something like 'value for money in healthcare' which would have forced private for-profit health care orgs to open up their books a bit. I hope an MLA will try to push it through - though it won't be Dr Swann, as a doctor he opposed that piece of policy. The issue is also as you mentioned that docs are paid waaaay too much and we need to open the doors of universities wide open : more docs is more service - but yes, they'll make a little less."
alberta,3csovy,JcakSnigelton,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason for professional corporations is because every other province had them and it was a huge tax deferral (not avoidance) tool that would often cause physicians to choose to practice elsewhere.   Your understanding of how it works in practice is a little blurry. No physicians professional corporation is building a hospital. A professional corporation doesn't absolve the physician of any liability in any sense whatsoever. That's the difference between a professional corporation and a corporation. That's why they still have to pay mandatory malpractice insurance.   Next, a physician operating as an independent contractor whether through a professional corporation or not, can be paid via a flat rate contract like a salary, fee for service, or under alternative revenue plans as well. Each has its pros and cons and nobody has determined what's best yet. On the surface fee for service is good because it encourages the physician to see as many people as possible. If instead they earned a flat rate amount they would likely take more time with each patient but this may also cause them to see less total patients, which would unintentionally drive of system wide wait times and accessibility.   A blank cheque isn't a fair representation. A quick Google will reveal the frozen compensation agreements under the PC's for the last 4 or 5 years. I think recently there was a minor increase.   Defining what ""too much money"" isn't for you or I to single handedly determine. Is a truck driver being paid 120k to drive dump trucks in fort mac too much money? Is a cabinet ministers ~250k combined salary too much? Maybe! But to put a blanket statement down is pretty unfair. A non-family physician is not guaranteed a job whatsoever either.  There are huge risks becoming a general surgeon for example. There is 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of med school, 5 years of residency, and then at least 2-4 years for a fellowship to be able to get a chance at a position. This comes out to around ~200k of debt, and on average working weeks during residency and some fellowships of about 80hrs, sometimes 28hr shifts (call), without time for more than one meal and one bathroom break, and a few naps. All while being up on your feet making life or death decisions, and being at risk to all possible diseases on a daily basis.  Some fee for service codes haven't been updated and that could be done. This would reduce some costs. But it is extremely difficult to determine what a fair compensation is.   Overall, I really fail to see how professional corporations are even mentionable when assessing s public administrator's work."
alberta,3csovy,zoobox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:57:30 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your nuance and further explanation. I find reddit hard sometimes because it usually starts with a knee-jerk, turns into a brain fart, and then someone calls you out for not fully developing your thesis in a meticulous and defensible format worthy of being judged by an academic committee.  My understanding of the model and its limitations are not for you to judge from a trite three paragraphs. You write from a position of experience, I can tell. However, your experience as a clinician, anecdotally, does not give you the last word on the issue, either, as inherently you reveal some natural biases that are fundamental to the problem.  So, I will dispatch the first item, immediately. No one cares about your four years of undergrad, four years of med school, five years of this, three years of that, yadda-yadda. There is no risk there. In addition to student loans, any bank will back a medical student to do whatever she needs to do to complete her training. You think that you have high student debt? So does every dentist, engineer, astrophysicist, lawyer, palaeontologist, doctoral graduate, post-doc - anyone who has completed a professional program or has spent more than twelve years in training. In fact, of all of those graduating with exceedingly high student debt, with the possible exception being a dentist, you are in the best position to repay all of those loans while achieving a comfortable lifestyle. And no job security?! Well, welcome to 2015.  Governments are not in the business of paying ""market rates,"" by the way. That is why they govern the public sector. In Canada, if not Alberta, we believe that some values are beyond the market. Government sets the rates. Were it competent and unafraid of the physicians' union, this dog could actually begin wagging its own tail, instead of where we are now.  So, please, spare the whine. And if you're not happy with the froshing and machismo that exists during residency then advocate for change. Professional literature proves this kind of freshman culture to be self-defeating and dangerous, anyways. Your self-imposed hardships are not bargaining leverage, they are professional immaturity. The public owes you no ""damages,"" in this regard.  Second, on the topics of compensation agreements, you are simply wrong. I would not point it out so frankly had you not snarked about ""a quick Google."" Here are the numbers:  2008/09: +5%  2009/10: +5%  2010/11: +4.5%  2011/12: 0%  2012/13: 0%  2013/14: 0%  2014/15: +2.5%  2015/16: +2.5%  2016/17: Cost of Living Adjustment  2017/18: Cost of Living Adjustment  No minor decreases, at all. And, it should be noted that the only reason the AMA agreed to the three years with 0% was because they negotiated more power and larger roles in health spending, overall, which gets to my main point. And do not attempt to characterize three years without increase as a decrease, either, because the union traded money for influence. Alberta physicians won an unprecedented amount of influence and powers of the purse with this contract. In fact, it could be argued that when Horne saw the writing on the wall, he knew that he'd be back to healthcare consulting and would need docs on his side so he negotiated a very generous contract, but I digress.  Third, I will offer the grace not given to me by saying you likely haven't written all that you know about payment schemes because, likewise, your explanation of them is rather ""blurry."" The pros and cons of the five basic payment models: fee-for-service; pay-for-coordination; pay for performance; episode payments; and, comprehensive care, are all, in fact, exceedingly well-studied and documented in a diverse array of settings and environments. It is mere politics that obfuscates the issues.  While fee-for-service ensures a moment-by-moment documentation of each procedure, it tends to incentivize extraneous and often unnecessary execution of redundant diagnostics (usually rationalized as risk-mitigation) and creates an enormous bureaucracy mostly dedicated to the system's accounting. If this sounds eerily like Alberta Health Services, it is not a coincidence. It is a poor model for public systems because clinicians and administrators unwittingly collude through symbiosis to expand billing in order to generate revenue, rather than primarily promoting health and wellness, either through intervention or prevention. It may not be the worst model but it clearly is not the best and it absolutely contributes to the high health care costs and poorer clinical outcomes that have been well-documented in Alberta.  Fourth, it is in the AMA leadership's best interest to have as much influence and decision-making power at the political level, as possible. You misunderstand the relevancy of being a professional corporation. It is not about liability, it is about transparency. An employee of a public system is loyal to the system and is accountable to that system. A professional corporation at arm's length from the public system is fundamentally not ever held to the same standard, nor is there the same expectation of transparency. Period.  Finally, part of the commonly-understood purpose of becoming a professional corporation is the acceptance that the PC will encounter significant overhead in the provision of its services and that, for those, a PC should be able to claim such overhead as expenses, lessening the operating burden and enabling reinvestment into the PC over time, as equipment, facilities and technologies evolve and need to be updated. But physicians and surgeons operating out of public hospitals pay none of this overhead. Unlike a dentist, per se, who pays the rent, owns the chairs, buys the Panorex, and pays her staff, the public pays the entire cheque for all of these expenses that a physician not just defers but avoids entirely.  In fact, your lead statement that Alberta docs lobbied for PCs after every other province already had them is also incorrect. Alberta doctors pioneered incorporation before any other province in the late 1970s as a way of protecting earnings. This I found via a quick Google.  Overall, I completely understand how you would fail to see how professional corporations impact the work of public health administration. You fail to see because you know very little about it and that is entirely forgivable. Being an ignorant horse's ass about it, however, is not.  Edit: spelling"

alberta,3csovy,rippppin,-5,Fri Jul 10 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"The current shift to 'preventative healthcare' is one of the most terrifying things I can think of.  In order to 'prevent' you from require healthcare later on, the government must control every aspect of your life and remove all risk from the equation right now.  'Preventative healthcare' is nothing more than code for 'we're going to tax the shit out of you for doing things that we don't think you should be doing.'  'Preventative healthcare' is the biggest reason that we're seeing things like a smokers tax by certain companies, a sugar tax in certain districts, the soda ban in NYC, etc.  Like most things, people can't or wont think of the 'unintended consequences' of such policies, of which there are obviously many.  This is not some 'anti-government conspiracy' that I've come up with, this is reality.  The government WILL try to control our every movement, and will regulate us into 'bubble boy' status because the risk of you becoming hurt while gardening are just too great and we can't have you hurt your back while lifting bags of soil.....  That's just one example, but you understand (I hope) where this is ultimately going.    Cue the REGRESSIVE-liberal jerkoffs that will come in here, down-vote this post to oblivion, and call me a misogynist for suggesting that Notley wants to control your life.  :/"
alberta,3csovy,Y2KNW,3,Fri Jul 10 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure if you're s deliberate troll or actual person and these are your actual thoughts. Nevertheless, the preventive healthcare (hopeful) shift doesn't have to be about control whatsoever.  Like capitalism, preventative healthcare can be incentivized and made easier with a framework for success - in the same way roads and utilities are built for businesses to connect to and use.  This could be done by providing tax credits for attending gyms, giving incentives to encourage people to buy less processed foods or learn to cook at home more. To something as simple as a tax credit for gym memberships or exercise classes.  Extra taxes on things like cigarettes are hard to argue against. What is harder is to determine if more extreme and dangerous sports should have higher taxes or user fees since the individuals are more likely to require medical services for broken bones, etc. at what point does the exercise that individual is doing offset the risk of them breaking a leg? And how does the cost and savings of these compare? That is a very tough question to address.   Aside from that aspect, preventative health care can be pushed by the physician side as well by meeting with the patients not only when they are sick. In this way, you can monitor your patients progress and if needed, make them aware of increasing risks they are facing if their unhealthy lifestyle is developing for them."
alberta,3csovy,redditmoose,-6,Fri Jul 10 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"That is a very tough question to address.    Uh, it's really not.  Part of the fallacy of 'free universal healthcare' is that I have the 'right' to do whatever the fuck I want, when I want, wherever I want, and I am not at any time held personally responsible for my actions,  If I want to play russian roullette and end up blowing my head off, that's the taxpayers problem - not mine.  I shouldn't have to fucking pay for my care.  Remember!  'FREE and UNIVERSAL!'  Oh, what's that?  You don't think that the taxpayers should be on the hook for my doing something stupid like that?  .....But I thought it was universal, no?  I thought that it was supposed to be for everyone regardless of circumstance, no?  So.....you're a hypocrite?  Is that what you're saying?  Jesus chirst, you are LITERALLY doing EXACTLY what I said that 'you people' would do in my previous post - picking who we should help and who we shouldn't, based entirely on circumstance.  We should help the cancer patient that never smoked, but fuck that guy that went skydiving, AmiRite?    That's not how this works, sunshine.  That's not how this works at all.    Either it's fucking universal and free and everyone gets treatment regardless, or it's not universal and it's not free and I should be able to buy private medical insurance.

alberta,3csovy,Rageagainsttheleftie,2,Fri Jul 10 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"No. You can't take a word (or statement), provide your own definition of it, then argue the definition you created. You're very good at doing this. But it is a bullshit way of arguing (and has no connection whatsoever to a debate).  Preventative healthcare is the concept of improving and maintaining health before you get sick (acute care). You need to provide opportunities and make it easy for screening (for example, colonoscopies when you turn 50). Preventative health care is genetic history and testing (for example, to see if your family has a history of diabetes) and general maintenance of health. It can even be physiotherapy. It can also be information and yes, even incentives, to live a healthier life style (like being able to claim gym membership, or get tax breaks for your children if they are in sports). Hell, even having a baseline for your levels is something that everyone should have, so when things start to go off, you know where your ""normal"" is.  Think of it as a truck. If you spend a little money on getting an oil change, general maintenance every X km - changing fluids, your fan belt, etc. You can spend a little money every year instead of having to buy a new truck every three years. Or replacing an entire engine or transmission.  This is common sense. This saves incredible amounts of money in the long run. It leads to people leading longer, healthier lives. It makes them more productive at work. It can help teach children at a young age to live a lifestyle that will have them be more productive members of society.  If no family doctors are available. If you don't have access to a family doctor for regular checkups. If vaccinations are not made available. If there are no clinics available for screening - this leads to more acute care. This is costly - not only from a societal sense, but from a monetary sense."

Alberta's premier could certainly change Alberta laws with respect to delivery of public services like health, education, justice and social services to our Aboriginal peoples, even though those are areas of shared responsibility.

Most of the articles in the declaration are already in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for all citizens which I would prefer to include aboriginal peoples. The UN declaration, in my opinion, gives rights that are superior to other citizens. Sort of a negative racism. Also it opens too many legal challenges which aboriginals can use to hold up and claim resources that I believe belong to all citizens of Canada.   I prefer a new partnership with them be drawn up that would of course honor their heritages, respect their traditions and treat them as equals. For starters, the Ministers of Indian Affairs should always be an elected ( by the First Nations ) native.Also Perhaps they could be treated as a 11th province to give them a seat at the table. Also a EEE Senate with 2 members from each province, territory, and this 1st nation would give them a good platform with pretty good proportional representation and benefit all citizens.

The NDP plan does none of this but is basically a blank cheque to do with as they see fit with no financial data or calculations.

The didn't have time argument is crap, they should have had a shadow budget and they've had 2 months now.

The finance minister is authorized to borrow up to 6 billion total to finance the Interim Supply Bill and other spending already put forward.   Without ministry access, it is impossible to have the detailed knowledge needed to put together a budget so a shadow budget wasn't really possible. And a budget sets out priorities and plans for the future: it takes a good understanding of the systems effects, which you can't get with just a few weeks on the job.

The proposal was that provided city lunches were vegan, not that anyone become vegan. I've said that I eat a lot of meat and I also said that their proposal was misguided. Where are you getting this hyperbolic extrapolation from?  And in any case, how can you not see the night and day difference between going vegan and forced sterilization?"
alberta,3csvwp,elldrick,0,Sun Jul 12 02:06:16 2015 UTC,Why? Over population is a bigger problem.
alberta,3csvwp,lardboy72,3,Sun Jul 12 02:28:06 2015 UTC,Actually the comment is valid...How much water is wasted on Agricultural land?  How much of what we eat is not native to this continent?  Agriculture even farming wheat produces huge amounts of waste and take large resources.    Perhaps if we just all foraged for our food things would be even better for the plants too.
alberta,3csvwp,Dabookitty,0,Mon Jul 13 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"Agriculture being water and resource intensive doesn't change the fact that raising meat is significantly more water and resource intensive. My whole point is that cutting meat out is a significant reduction in energy and emissions. While farming could be significantly more efficient and environmentally friendly, that doesn't change the facts of my point. Of course foraging would be better for the encironment, but that's almost as ridiculous a proposal as lardboy's proposal we stop eating and having children. Just because we can't achieve perfection is no reason not to seek improvement, and reducing or cutting meat from your diet would be an environmental improvement."
alberta,3csvwp,elldrick,2,Mon Jul 13 22:48:12 2015 UTC,"Agriculture being water and resource intensive doesn't change the fact that raising meat is significantly more water and resource intensive.    And what about it?  We do a lot of energy intesive things in Alberta...especially where it can be done easier and quicker in other parts of the world.   My whole point is that cutting meat out is a significant reduction in energy and emissions.    So would legislating that all new vehicles sold after a certain date must be Hybrid or Electric...That would be far easier to make happen and get people behind.  Since you are not forcing your personal belief on some one else.     While farming could be significantly more efficient and environmentally friendly, that doesn't change the facts of my point.   So both are bad for the enviroment...one is just worse...okay...so your point is...the lesser of two evils?   Of course foraging would be better for the encironment, but that's almost as ridiculous a proposal as lardboy's proposal we stop eating and having children   Actually it is not.  We can and have surivived for thousands upon thousands of years doing just that...foraging...and survived.  On average it took a human about 6 hours of foraging to attain the necessary caloric intake.    As ridculous as not having children?  [China]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).  Or delaying children until you can afford them and having responsible family planning?  Stop eating?  Well stop over eating...most of us can do with consuming less and wasting less.  If we stop over eating and stop wasting so much food...would also be better for everyone.   Just because we can't achieve perfection is no reason not to seek improvement   And who said to stop seeking improvement.  If you see removing meat from YOUR diet as improvement...All the power to YOU!  That is not an improvement at all for me...it is actually very bad and detrimental...so you can see your improvement I will seek mine.   reducing or cutting meat from your diet would be an environmental improvement.   This I can agree with though.  Reducing farm meat consumption can do some benefits for the enviroment.  But reducing the over all amount we eat also acomplishes this goal.  But then I don't eat much farm meat...my meat is 90% eviromentally friendly has next to no harm to the enviroment.  The Deer and Moose and other animals I eat are all wild and have had no industrial pollution made in the process of them reaching maturity.  So if you are all about the enviroment...I am to...Got to keep hunting sustainable so I can avoid all the evil Farm meat."

She is doing exactly what is her mandate, and she's implementing it fast and hard while engaging in active talks with oil to try to smooth out what is a poisoned well to begin with.  She didn't have to have a policy at all to have them at her throat.  So she's taking the right steps in that direction.  Not so sure about some of her personnel choices."

To the Harper government's mind, it's not ethical for a child to be killed by a landmine produced by prison labour, or in a country where women are not allowed to vote. Not when they could be killed by a landmine produced ethically right here in Mr. Harper's Canada."

She also works hard - she's moving fast to push out her policy - whether you like that or not.  Who's side she's on, her policies, and what she values are maybe things you can argue.

She spends a fair amount of time talking to oil to smooth over (which is her objective I think), and at the same time she is seems to be raising taxes to get ready to spend on things she promised Albertans as per her platform and mandate.  I'd say those are both rational things that she ought to be doing."

There's not a lot of support in the oil patch for refining, unless the government sweetens the pot significantly. The economics didn't support it pre-Notley, and they certainly won't with depressed oil prices (not Notley, obviously), increased taxes and higher carbon pricing."

Here's another one from MacLeans: ""It happened to be an oil industry lobbyist, who had just left an investor’s forum where Premier Rachel Notley had delivered her first major"" ... ""This plaid-shirted fellow told me didn’t expect that kind of speech to the Stampede Investor Forum.

There is a long list of considerations involved in deciding to vote for a political party, and spreading misinformation based on incomplete information or gut instinct opinions is tantamount to attacking democracy itself.   I agree, which is why I was frustrated with Don Braid's article.  She made a speech to some industry representatives and received some positive feedback.  I can agree with that. Nothing in his article supports ""Notley wows Alberta business with pro-oilsands speech"" and his implication that industry is now on team Notley based on his gut instinct opinions is absolutely spreading misinformation.    Notley may be fine. Maybe she'll be great.

They don't even have to be 'well' reasoned its just important to move, however slowly, back towards the idea that we need reasons to justify action.  Ideology is important but so polarizing; all sides need to reset and acknowledge what is actual, practical, and scientific.   It is such rich irony that our society has incredible, unprecedented access to accurate scientific information and we simply refuse to use it or even pay any attention to it at all.  That's a good argument for the individual, so much is possible now.  However, we consistently run into the trap of trying to apply personal solutions on a societal level.

alberta,3ckh3z,ApoliticalypseNow,2,Thu Jul 9 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly I don't know why he got down voted so hard? Like it or not TexasNorth has valid points, maybe not communicated the best - but valid nonetheless. You can't simply do one thing and then say another (even though most of the most hated politicians in history seem to have lived by that mantra). Any intelligent person would be suspicious of a persons intention if what they said was completely contradictory to what they did. To do otherwise makes you fall into the same category as the rest of the sheeple who help dig us into these never ending political nightmares (like continually voting the same political party into place and allowing corruption and ignorance to manifest coughcough).  Up until this single speech; the only other thing she has done that could be considered pro business and pro oil has been telling industry that its going to be A-Ok. I don't know how many of the people on this subreddit own their own businesses; but if you do and your future looked uncertain, would someone telling you that things are going to be ""A-Ok"" be settling to you? Personally, I'd probably want some details as to why the uncertainty would be A-Ok. To those that aren't, this flaccid attempt to settle investors was similar to taking a drive down highway 63 or hwy 2 in the passenger seat with a blind driver telling you its going to be A-Ok - because that's about as much comfort as anyone got from the NDP's first dog and pony show.   So why the skepticism? Well lets look at what she has done so far:   Put someone in charge of energy who had no idea about the oil and gas industry. Same also went for agriculture which was around in Alberta prior to O&G ever becoming a thing here. Pretty unsettling knowing the people who are supposed to be making informed decisions for these industries know very little of the actual operation of these industries (and no, teaching people theory is not the same as understanding it. If you have a Health & Safety department at your work, look at how some of their initiatives line up with actual business operations). Basically the real life example: How would you feel about a mechanic performing a medical surgery on you? They both work with tools though right? So I bet the down voters would be cool with it. Competency is a beautiful thing. wikipedia on Margaret Ellen McCuaig-Boyd our minister of energy Graham Mitchell was appointed as chief of staff to Alberta’s minister of energy. He has been very public about his anti-oil stance. Some source information if you require it Not really oil & gas related but the increase to $15 an hour; this is anti-everything. I get we need to have social programs to help lower income individuals and I'm 100% for that; after all not everyone can be a CEO.  However I'm not willing to support an agenda that will more than likely boost everyone's cost of living to where that boost in minimum wage is negated. If you think cost of living isn't going to be increased you aren't thinking about how much it costs to get something on a grocery store shelf including that pimple faced teenager who will be working the check-out and his three buddies stocking the shelves. And if you think I'm full of it; take a step back - if you are maintaining a 40% margin on your COG, why are you going to take the hit on the increased operational cost? You won't, instead you'll push the cost increase to the consumer; so in 5 years when everything is balanced out again we'll be having the same debate again because even to those making minimum wage, things won't be affordable anymore - so this debate will be for $20 an hour instead. Look at Fort McMurray in the last decade; you can't even get a guy to poor your coffee without paying them $25/hour and every year that has to increase because the cost of goods and services keeps increasing mainly due to these ridiculous wages (although logistics does play a part). People bitch about losing the middle class yet they keep doing stuff like this to help ensure the extinction of the middle class. When that inflation hits how long will it take for your 1-3% cost of living adjustments most middle and upper class workers get per year to offset the increased cost of goods and services? It's lunacy, so while this is a good short term fix for the lower wage earners of Alberta; it hurts alot of people at the same time. Lastly even for the people who aren't opposed to the change that has occurred; how can you blindly trust a politician just by what they're saying? Especially after steady eddy, ratford, and look-in-the-mirror prentice. If you want everyone to blindly follow yours or others political beliefs without at least questioning we might as well say fuck voting and jump straight to fascism cause thats exactly the culture that eats up propaganda.    I could keep going but I figured I'd mention the big ones that I myself have questioned and are making some people I've spoken to skeptical. If being slightly distrustful of a politician and their agenda is cause for a down vote; then fill your boots on this post as well. But if and when things go to shit like they did with the PC party because people like yourselves didn't at least take the few moments to question the words vs actions of our leadership - don't come crying to reddit, facebook or any other social media - because it was the mindlessness that you wanted and you got what you wanted."

There have been some other names that have popped up who are also NDP party members and/or top government officials who have been documented for participating in anti-oil rallies but that wasn't the point of my post.  And regardless of that; it still doesn't negate that her actions have so far contradicted her words.  Hell just look at how she has been very vocal about being against the majority of major pipelines to ship our product out of province, so instead we'll just keep giving $2-3 a barrel towards Berkshire Hathaway owned interests to get our product to market. Yet now suddenly according to her latest speech the oilsands is such a valuable asset to Alberta and she loves them so much? She wants to drastically increase the operational costs to oil related businesses in our province but they're a valuable asset? I mean I get alot of people instantly think of US based O&G companies like BP, Conoco, etc. But what about the Canadian ones? To be quite frank my point is she needs to shit or get off the pot but stop trying to play both sides of the fence because its going to do more damage to our province in the long run, we move to fast as a province to have someone who isn't going to take decisive action one way or the other and that's all people like me are saying.  Even if your anti-oil, which is understandable with all the concern that has begun slowly escalating since the BP incident a few years back. How can you honestly say you are comfortable with any politician (left right or center); who can't even decide on a budget and just got pre-approved for a 6 billion dollar line of credit; especially when one of their platforms was that they were going to work to get that province out of debt? My past experience, you don't get pre-approved on a mortgage unless you plan on getting a mortgage. Again, do I have an issue with her flip flopping? Yes. She needs to make up her mind.  And just while I'm on my rebuttle to your ""take a hint"" patronage; here is the job posting Alberta Website!. Read through it carefully; because it seems to me that it would be pretty easy sitting in that role to feed misinformation that could damage 22% of the provinces economy. But hey; you might be right; how damaging could someone in that role be since they only feed their industry information and operation know-how up to the dm & minister of energy who in turn makes educated decisions on new policy and policy improvements based on that information. I seem to remember our neighbors having a major event happening based on falsified information being passed up through the ranks...oh ya that was called the Iraq war when people down the food chain supposedly had evidence that saddam had WMDs.

She may be against some pipelines like Keystone XL and the pipeline to the BC coast, but both of those pipelines had a snowballs chance in hell if actually getting built anyway because the president is against it and BC wants too much and, IIRC, she is supportive of a pipeline to the east coast of Canada.  Where had she said she wants to ""drastically increase"" costs to oil related businesses? They want to do a review of royalties. That's all. I think you just made up this whole paragraph.  As the wildrose critic stated, any government would have had to do the same thing, they just would have authorized less. It's just an authorization, comparing it to a mortgage preapproval is silly, and the bills need to get paid and no govt is going to be able to pull $6B out of their butts or make enough cuts to cover the difference.  You may be right about the job description, but maybe having a critical voice around isn't the worst thing in the world. He still doesn't make policy. Would having a pro-oilsands chief of staff be a better option for anyone but the oil rich? Should 'must be oil neutral' be part of the job description?

He/She's the one helping to ensure all the brains in the department are providing the information to make educated decisions on making new policies and improving existing policies. That might not directly make the policy (your right) but you can't tell me that information that they provide doesn't help to form the policy. If you are so blind to believe that the minister and deputy minister write every single word of policy and do all the researching themselves, your sadly mistaken. So again; it does matter that an individual who is against the industry is indirectly involved in helping to form the policy. Hope that makes sense this time.  Pipelines - In this geo-political climate of O&G putting your eggs in one basket is generally a bad idea all the way around. I'd also like to point out BC is alot easier to get approval then Quebec; even if we do fund a massive amount of Quebec's social programs using our ""dirty oil"", the fact is both those pipelines have about equal chance.    Increased operational costs; increased taxes, increased carbon fees, trying to put refineries in Alberta, royalty reviews, and even the increase in wages is going to effect their operational costs - make no mistake about it. Remember; right now and probably for the next year we'll be in tight oil and if you don't think those things don't add to an increased cost of doing business you're living in a fantasy. It's also the main reason where if the margin is red; we have Companies already pushing budgets out of our province.  How do they know they need 6 billion? They don't even have a functioning budget to know what they need to spend? And ya I will give you analogies since you shouldn't be asking to borrow money or even pre-approving yourself until you have an idea of what you need and how you plan on paying it back. I don't want my grand kids to be paying off debt created by this government, the last one, or the next one for that fact. Thank you very much.  You say you are all for being critical of government, but you so far have missed my point completely and again for a second time, which tells me that contrary to your statement about being critical you don't want to be critical yourself. Her actions have contradicted what she's saying; like it or not, and you might be cool with how things are going, but I'm personally not. I'm sorry if her actions so far aren't at the very least a small red flag for you, but it is for me and enough to tell me to proceed with caution. And just so you know; back when Allison Redford pulled the same hypocritical shit I was still being critical so this isn't a left vs right thing. Personally I could care less if a political party is Blue, Orange, Green, Purple, whatever - as long as they have our Province's best interests at heart. I'm willing to give anyone a chance, including alot of these first time politicians who have now been entrusted with the next 4 years of Alberta's future but the make it or break it for me is it has to be as long as they're practicing what they're preaching, which so far they haven't. I'm sorry if after the last four premiers fucking up this beautiful province that I was born and raised in and I love and call home I'm a bit skeptical and critical - but if this province gets burned a 5th time because a bunch of sheeple decided to blindly believe every word the new premier had to say without taking heed to their actions then I refuse to be one of the people who sat idly by, not saying a word, and believing every word (true or bullshit) that spewed from that politicians mouth."
alberta,3ckwrw,Adjudikated,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"but you can't tell me that information that they provide doesn't help to form the policy.   Never said otherwise.   If you are so blind to believe that the minister and deputy minister write every single word of policy and do all the researching themselves   Don't know how you came to this assumption, but you seem to come to a lot of assumption based on few or no facts. You're assuming this guy is not interested in just doing his job but is only interested in pushing an agenda. I don't know the guy, maybe you know something I don't. Assuming for a second he is only interested in pushing an agenda, is he really going to be the only source of information the ministers receive? Do executives in the industry not have some means of getting in touch with the ministers or the premier to set the record straight? If the chief of staff has all the power why don't we just cut to the chase and make him premier and save us all a lot of trouble?   So again; it does matter that an individual who is against the industry is indirectly involved in helping to form the policy.   Ok, and if that's the case then it would also matter if an individual was specifically in support of the industry. Where in the job description did it say that the chief of staff has to be an oilsands supporter? I ask again, would having a pro-oilsands chief of staff be a better option for anyone but the oil rich? Should 'must be oil neutral' be part of the job description?   Hope that makes sense this time.   Petty insults. Always a sign of a well thought out and accurate argument.   putting your eggs in one basket is generally a bad idea   We're not talking about the only pipeline coming in or out of the province, just extra capacity.   Increased operational costs;   They haven't done anything other than increase corporate taxes a whopping 2% making it basically the same as most of the other provinces. If a 2% provincial tax increase is the difference between profit and bankruptcy then I'm not sure your business is financially sustainable.   the increase in wages is going to effect their operational costs   I don't think a lot of people in the oil industry or supporting industries are making minimum wage.   How do they know they need 6 billion? They don't even have a functioning budget to know what they need to spend?   They have 40 years of PC budgets, including the unpassed budget for this year to base on. I'm going to take a wild guess that they didn't just throw a dart at a dart board and go with that number.   You say you are all for being critical of government   I am, but I'm waiting for them to actually do something wrong. You are jumping to conclusions, assuming the worst, and fear mongering based on what the government might do to screw everything up. The fact is they've only been in power for 2 months after 40 years of PC rule. It's going to take time to sort shit out and actually make change, for better or worse.   but if this province gets burned a 5th time because a bunch of sheeple decided to blindly believe every word the new premier had to say without taking heed to their actions   What was the alternative? Another 4 years of PCs, hoping that they've learned their lesson from the past 40? The PCs were too comfortable, had very little respect for the taxpayers or taxpayer money, and change was needed. History may prove that the NDP were not a good choice, but we don't know that yet, and we won't know that any other party could have done better."
alberta,3ckwrw,mylastbreath,0,Fri Jul 10 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"So it doesn't concern you that an anti-oil activist who has so far dedicated the last decade or so to pushing his agenda might be in place and trying to push his agenda now from within the government? lol - just let it sink in. I also came to that assumption because you clearly didn't read the official job description or take time to do any cross checking. You literally said ""that isn't true""; without actually taking the time to realize that there is quite a bit of validity to what I have so far said. I'll do my best to lead you to water (And hopefully vice versa), but neither of us can make the other drink and see the facts for what they are. And I want to be clear because maybe you misunderstand; I don't spout these things off for personal gain or pride or anything like that. Its because it honestly concerns me to see multiple reports of the same fact across multiple mediums. I have literally served you with the specific job position he is in, one which was posted by the Alberta government - if you don't want to take what is within that resource as consideration as to how much damage a person could technically do in that role if they wanted to promote a personal agenda....Thats all you man, personally it still makes me concerned for the future...And no amount of political speeches is going to fix that until I see positive results. Sorry.  You talk about petty insults, yet first responded with a patronizing comment about hinting and yet you want to still try and call me out for assumptions based on facts that are public knowledge, as made available through publicly available documents and the media (both left and right sources). The fact that you can't simply rest with the idea that maybe someone is critical due to watching someone not practicing what they are currently preaching is actually rather sad. It's not an insult that you still aren't getting it, because judging by your responses you'd rather try and pick a part facts - not delivered by me; but facts delivered by trusted media outlets and publicly available documents then understand what the person has repeated to you now 3 times.  Pipelines - double check your energy east work scope. You might be surprised to find out its a bit more comprehensive then expanding capacity. Which is exactly why the chances for both pipelines are very similar.  Did I say that additional operational cost was already implemented? No. But why would the government bother discussing it if these aren't avenues they're willing to take? Why would they even bring them up if you were in their shoes? I think maybe you just solved the 6 billion dollar mystery for me; they want to spend most of it on exploring doing these changes that were part of their political platform that they never actually intended on implementing. What can I say, consultants and studies cost alot amirite or amirite?  You obviously don't understand that an increase in minimum wage might not directly effect the oil and gas industry or many others; but your foolish if you think it doesn't have an indirect ripple effect because somewhere down the line that cost is absorbed which then trickles through. Fort McMurray is a prime example of how even everyday products and services have become ridiculously priced. $30 cheeseburger anyone? I'll let you fact check this one yourself, I can give you some recommendations if you would like....  As for the 6 billion; like it or not with nothing on paper they are looking alot like they play alot of darts. So much for the transparency they claimed they were going to bring during campaigning. Oh is this another example of saying one thing and doing another? Thanks for proving my point for me this time and showing exactly why I'm critical. I appreciate it.  How am I jumping to conclusions? I'm being critical; as you said its far to soon to have arrived to a conclusion yet. I'm literally watching what they're doing and listening to what they're saying. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt (which everyone should; I don't think any true Albertan wants us to crash and burn regardless of whose in power), because if things work out I'd be super happy for all parties involved. But until I see an alignment between talking and doing - I'm not about to stop being critical and as a voter that is fully within my rights to do.  However if they keep doing what they're doing currently, I'm going to sleep extremely well knowing that as a voter and a concerned citizen I have done my part to voice my concerns and push for the required changes in 4 years.   Lastly we also had alternatives beyond NDP and Tories but hey thanks for taking the time to read what I said and realize that I wasn't saying vote PC, in fact far from it if you took the time to process what I said you would have seen that. It was voices like mine that were screaming for a change back when Steady Eddy started messing around and causing negative effects for Alberta - remind me how many premiers ago was that?"
alberta,3ckwrw,Adjudikated,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"It concerns me no more and no less than if a former pro-oil lobbyist was appointed to the position. I don't care what he used to do, I care what he does now. That said, he apparently only worked at the lobby group for 4 months, and a lobby registry shows that no actual lobbying of federal officials was done since Graham Mitchell was registered. So I'm not really sure what the problem is. Could he maybe possibly have an agenda he wants to push on the energy minister? Sure, maybe possibly. You don't know that he does, and I don't know that he doesn't. I'm well aware of what is job description is, but that's a problem for you because you assume he's going to try to push an agenda you think he has. Those aren't facts, those are assumptions based on one past job he held for just 4 months (January to April.)  The Energy East pipeline wants to convert an existing gas pipeline to an oil pipeline to move 1.1m bpd to refineries in the east with associated pumps and supporting equipment. That's the scope. I have no idea what you're getting at here.  No, you didn't say additional operational cost was already implemented, but that's exactly the point. You're criticizing the govt for wanting to ""drastically increase the operational costs to oil related businesses"" (your words) but the government has neither A) done anything or B) announced anything other than a fairly small increase to corporate provincial taxes. So you're critical of the govt because you think they might do something?  I understand perfectly what an increase in minimum wage will do, and affecting the oil industry directly or indirectly is not one of them. Costs and wages in Fort McMurray are already insane, increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr in 3 years is not going to change anything up there when wages are already far past that for even fast food workers. I think you overestimate what effect the minimum wage will have on high wage areas like oil and the supporting industries.  On the rest of your points, we'll just agree to disagree. I will say that critics immediately stated that any government would have had to authorize borrowing in this manner as well, they just would have had to authorize less (without knowing any numbers, ironically.) The lack of transparency is probably a valid criticism, I'll give you that."
alberta,3ckwrw,mylastbreath,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:32:22 2015 UTC,"Life is checks and balances; you should have people for it and against it if you truly want the best outcome because you can actually come up with effective policy that way. I won't dispute that having someone on the complete opposite side of the spectrum would be any better however that shouldn't be the case period. For him specifically my comments aren't based off not just his tenure as an executive director to one US funded anti-oil group (although that alone should have excluded him from being in that role just as it would if he was the CEO of xyz energy in downtown Calgary), but my comments also came along because of much more than 4 months worth of his tweets and some of his other documented anti-oil activities.  Energy east application shows not just an upgrade to the entire line to pump that additional capacity to the St. Lawrence but also an addition to the line to pump an additional 800 bpd from Quebec to the maritimes.   I'm actually not criticizing the government on something they haven't implemented I'm being critical about something they're posturing to do through the platform that they campaigned on, there is a bit of a difference - not huge but a difference nonetheless. So its not whether I think they might do something but something they've publicly said that they are exploring doing or intend to do.  Again; I used Fort McMurray as an example of how increasing wages affects the cost of living and never once mentioned that it was going to effect them further, although in all fairness starting wage @ Timmies in FMM is approx. $20 an hour and will probably need to be increased to continue to draw in people to work those positions, unless of course we bring in more foreign workers to do it.   However I was actually referring to how it would basically give the rest of Alberta a similar inflation. Sorry if that was unclear but it was the truth. Do you think McDonalds is suddenly going to eat that $6.5-7/per employee increase out of the kindness of their hearts? And before you try to dispute that my math is close to correct +/- a few cents. $5 for the actual raise and probably about $1.5-2 more is lost through administration/benefits/employer taxes/wcb/etc. obviously depending on the employer however most would calculate the additional employment costs at around 30%. No they won't they'll be passing that onto the consumer at probably a pre-tax keystone of around 40%. So its now costing the consumer an additional $9. Still follow? The oilfield uses everything from fuel (most gas station attendants are around the minimum wage level - do you think this won't now have to be factored into rising fuel costs? Ever notice how fuel jumps drastically around September/October - prepare you asshole for the pillaging you'll get after a hike to minimum wage comes in), food ( this forces a raise in per diem since restaurant food and fast food will rise in price to adjust with wages), camp costs (do you think the campies making $18/hour are going to settle for $18 an hour after minimum wage is hiked to $15? Fuck no, they'll want to be paid for being stationed int he middle of nowhere and I don't blame them, so suddenly my $280/night camp is now $350 per night). So those are just some (not all) of the direct costs already going to be seen from that little bump in minimum wage. So maybe some of it is overestimating, or maybe some of it is from watching whats happened in Fort McMurray when they used to have minimum wage workers versus the economic nightmare they have now...   With the borrowing you need to have an idea of how much you need to borrow, you need a budget to know that. How do you know what you need? How do you know what gap is left that needs to be covered? How do you figure out what your new social reforms are going to require? Not sure whats hard to understand about that?  So I'm curious why it bothers you so much that I'm critical of a government that so far has had actions which are opposite to many of the things they have said?"

That doesn't mean that at that price anyone wants to run out and drill; it just means that they'll keep the wells/pipelines there still running and maintained with minimal support.  You go to fort mcmurray for SAGD though and it's considerably more money to keep those wells operational due to the process required to extract the oil from non-mining processes.  Also ; WCS - Westeran Canadian Select, not WTI - West Texas Intermediate or any other oil price. Generally whatever WTI is at in western canada we are $8-12 cheaper per barrel due to logistics to transport it and amount of refining required to get a usable product (fuel, plastics, etc.)."

After all, why should the government be able to tell you what you can and can't do on your property?  Well, Texas thinks that way too.

Coulda used some regulations.  http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/us/west-texas-fertilizer-plant-explosion-investigation/  Of course that's a bit larger scale than cabs.

These people have a drivers licence which is more than I can say about some cab drivers in Edmonton. They have stricter security checks than the cab companies and all rides are logged. Statically uber is actually a safer ride. I would rather see less drunk drivers. Like you said in your earlier post if you don't like something don't do it. No one is forcing you into an uber but they are still making you safer by getting drunks off the road.

alberta,3cbna4,44years,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:29:53 2015 UTC,If a cab driver gets in an accident it depends what kind of insurance and lisence the driver has. Some cab drivers rent the car from the real driver and aren't actually insured. When a cab driver attacks someone most the time they aren't even caught. Uber attacks are rare because they are always caught instantly. Every driver I have talked to about it did have the proper insurance and license. Uber also has a 5 million dollar policy to cover any damage the drivers insurance doesn't cover. You can spew the taxi Union talking points all you want but even some of the taxi drivers I have talked to like uber.

She advised the youth councillors when they voted to make their monthly meals vegan.   I hate idealist hard line that people take on this sort of stuff. Yeah reduction in meat consumption has environmental value.  But why does it have to be an absolute hard line? If I reduce my meat consumption by 99%, it's only 1% worse than becoming a vegetarian.  The argument is of course 'It's the principle', or 'it's easier to do all or none', bit that's silly. I think it just polarizes people, and actually hurts the cause more.  I mean, you would never do that with recycling. If we created a term called ""Recycler"" that only applied to someone who didn't have a general waste basket in their house, I think many fewer people would recycle.  If we created a term called 'greenhouser' and only gave it to a person who uses absolutely no fossil fuels, in the forms of heating, buses, airplanes, plastics, etc.  And these new things - ""Recyclers"" and ""Greenhousers"", wouldn't be though to really hold any special moral authority, over anyone else. So why is ""Vegan"" and ""Vegitarian"" such an all or nothing thing?  Can't they just eat less meat? Or perhaps an better way to frame it eat more vegetables! Think of it in the positive, like recycling. Every extra carrot you eat, is one less bite of steak. It doesn't mean you're a horrible person to indulge in steak every once in a while, any more than you're a horrible person if you buy something with non-recyclable packaging and have to throw it out - it's just a nice way to reduce our impact.

alberta,3c9vj6,westernmail,7,Mon Jul 6 13:15:52 2015 UTC,"I love this argument. It is comical how we expect trains to be ""feasible"" (ie pay themselves off through tickets), yet we build billions worth of roads that collect nothing in fares without a second thought.  Why not the other way around? Charge tolls for using roads, and build trains with that money."
alberta,3c9vj6,J__rad,3,Mon Jul 6 15:17:46 2015 UTC,So we don't have a gas tax anymore? The simplest solution is make 100% of highway funding come from fuel taxes.   How do I get from my home to my brothers home across the province in a Sunday night without roads?   Cars offer personal freedom of both schedule and destination.
alberta,3c9vj6,Gears_and_Beers,4,Mon Jul 6 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"Gas tax is an indirect and ineffective tax. It does not directly tie to the infrastructure utilized, so it fails the benefit principle. It also fails to provide funds directly to the level of government responsible for infrastructure financing. In addition, it fails to account for weight and efficiency differentials between vehicles.  Past all these obvious failures, you would not be able to afford to drive if the gas tax was raised to the level needed to actually pay for roads. Your gas rate would triple or even quadruple.  The ""freedom"" argument is always funny coming from north Americans who haven't travelled. If you go to a city or region that has actual good transit, you'll quickly realize that you have far more freedom of movement there. You are not tied to routes, you are not tied to parking locations, you are not tied to traffic, you are not tied to boring and expensive urban form.  Transit oriented societies are incredibly easy to navigate at all hours of the day. Far more than our horribly planned roads designed around clunky, outdated, inefficient, and slow cars.  For instance, let's answer your question for someone in the UK. ""How do I get to my brothers home across the country on Sunday night"". You hop on a bus that arrives outside your home every 10 minutes and get to a tube station in 5 minutes. You hop on the tube and get to the central station in 10 minutes. You hop on the train, and sip a beverage and read for 2 hours, and you are there.  Easy, same is true across Europe and in much of Asia. And before your inevitable comment about population density, remember that you need to compare destination density. We have a lot of empty space, but that space is not being serviced."
alberta,3c9vj6,J__rad,3,Mon Jul 6 17:02:51 2015 UTC,This breaks down outside of large urban centres.
alberta,3c9vj6,aardvarkious,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"83 per cent of our population is urban, and trains work in corridor type development patterns, which is the case in Alberta. One train line with three stops would capture a vast majority of our population.   The density argument is very bad. Urban density is roughly the same in most places all over the world (only exceptions being massive global agglomeration cities like Tokyo or London).   What trains in Alberta would do is create a fast, pedestrian accessible link between our population centres. The economic impact was pegged at magnitudes larger than road twinning. Yet, we don't do it because it won't ""pay itself off"". Neither will roads, but they do less for us as well."
alberta,3c9vj6,J__rad,2,Mon Jul 6 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Gas tax duly captures the size and fuel efficiency of different road users, smaller cars use less gas, larger heavier trucks use more. It's probably the most effective capture of the wear on roads.   Why shouldn't the price of fuel fully reflect the the cost of the roads? I could afford a higher price of gas if all my other tax expensive a that pay for roads where reduced accordingly.   The province collects fuel tax, is responsible for roads. The cities exist at the whim of province so funding of city roads is a provincial matter.   Really so if I live in London and my brother lives in a small farming community in Wales. I won't have a problem getting there in a Sunday night?   do you honesty believe any public transit system could get me from SW Calgary to Camrose in less than triple the time it takes to drive?   I'm come to my conclusion about the freedom of cars not by not being a world travel but rather because of it. I do love a city where I don't need a car to be a tourist but if you never use a car in any European country id say you've not truly visited those counties. Short of spending months taking trains and busses you just couldn't visit a lot of great smaller centres without roads and cars. Japan is probably the only exception."
alberta,3c9vj6,Gears_and_Beers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Gas does not effectively tax user benefit. You might believe it does, but it doesn't. There is not a 1:1 relationship between road damage (use) and gas consumption. Therefore, it is an ineffective tax.   Example: a smart car causes exactly zero damage to roads. It could drive every single day, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and cause zero damage. It is simply too light to cause damage. Yet, it would still pay tens of thousands in gas taxes to do that.  A logging truck on the other hand causes damage with ONE loaded trip. It burns maybe half a tank of gas on that trip, and pays about $30-50 in taxes.  Do you understand why it is not a good tax?  We need to have toll roads that measure distance and weight. This is done all over the world with great results. A camera takes a picture of your license plate getting on and off the highway, and charges you per km. Large trucks go through a swim lane and are weighed in motion.  Your other arguments are a bit confounding. For the minute amount of the population that needs for some reason to travel solely in the minority of time in which transit is not operational, they could simply drive on a basic road system. No one is saying that roads should be ripped out. It is not ""trains or roads"", that is a false dichotomy.   I am saying simply that we should use the benefit principle in financing for both methods, and subsidize them dependent on their economic, social, and environmental impacts. Trains are economically, socially, and environmentally superior, so they should be subsidized more."
alberta,3c9vj6,J__rad,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"First no road user causes zero damage to the road and repairing the road is not the only cost. There the is the capital cost of the road.  Plus the cost of signals, signs, bridges, drainage, lighting and the entire list of other things that your smart car needs to use the road.   Second your greatly over estimating your smart car. Even if you could drive 365x24 at 50kph you'd only pay around $3000 in provincial fuel tax. So your an order of magnitude off from understanding your own argument.   A small car driving 30k a year at 4.7 l/100k will pay $185. Almost nothing considering the utility one gains from moving ones self 30,000 kms.    Where a fully loaded semi truck doing Calgary to Edmonton return 4 days a week would pay $5500 a year in fuel tax. 100k km at 39l/100km  Fuel economy is directly proportional to weight and power. Wear on the roads is also directly proportional to weight. I just don't understand how you don't understand that dividing the cost of the roads by the number of litters sold is not only the simplest it's also the fairest way to do it. Sure it'll fall apart in 30 years when a non marginal percentage of cars don't use liquid fuels but then we could smart just rod tax mileage x weight at time of renewal.   Some rough and basic math. Alberta uses around 10.5 billion litres of gas and diesel. Which at 14 cents per litre is 1.47 billion dollars.  According to transport Alberta they will spend 8.1 billion over the next 5 years or 1.62b a year. Even if cities needed the same we'd only need to increase fuel tax from 14cents to 31cents to cost everything of a 3.2 billion dollar road budget.   Don't let math and the laws of physics get in the way of your beliefs though."

It was a fast and comfortable ride. Today, almost all rail traffic is freight. To accommodate increased passenger traffic would require major upgrades to the rail network to let passengers and freight share the rails.  Around the early to mid-1970's the Greyhound bus, with a similar schedule and parallel routes, became less expensive than the Day Liner. I switched to the bus until I got my first car. The Day Liner vanished after a few more years, likely due to a declining ridership.  I don't believe our population density can support the kind of passenger and commuter trains found in more populated areas. We have two major urban areas with surrounding bedroom communities which might benefit from metro services within them and might have a chance at being cost effective. Elsewhere, I think it is unlikely that metro services would be cost effective.  There may be opportunities for bus lines to provided enhanced services if demand is there."

It's not just (a relatively small number of) people currently earning under $15/hr who will be paid more, but a large number of other workers as well. And then proportionately of the increase will get eaten by the Feds and by the province through income taxes and disqualification from low-income exceptions and supports, so it's difficult to determine how much of the benefit stays in Alberta."
alberta,3c90wv,BraveryInc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"That is the intended result, but it is an ineffective and inefficient way of reaching it.

alberta,3c90wv,J__rad,2,Mon Jul 6 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry, I agree.  I think minimum wage increase at such a steep rate is the wrong choice.  The market forces work wonders on labour.  People making current minimum wage are able to live just fine in smaller towns in Alberta, and if real estate/rental costs weren't so damn high in Edmonton/Calgary, they could do it here too.  It's the wrong solution for the wrong problem."

I am a self described success story born of existing social programs that gave me the ability to turn my life around for the better.   I spent a lot of years working minimum wage. Shoes taped together, scrounging for food, always down to my last few bucks, can't pay rent.  Trust me man, I know it sucks but without those experiences I wouldn't have had the drive to get where I am today.   Hand outs are not the solution.

However, there are better ways, such as the policies you mentioned, unfortunately, those programs cost public money,  which Alberta don't have right now. Minimum wage increases do not cost the government money and actually increase revenues by increasing incomes of poor people so they make enough to pay income tax.   3) I agree, which is a benefit of a higher, single-tier minimum wage .

The first question Albertans should be asking is why only $15 if increasing minimum wage is universally beneficial? Why not the living wage, or $30/hr?  The second question is why the government refuses to provide employers and employees their roadmap to $15/hr, so that Albertans can plan their finances accordingly. Under the previous government, minimum wage was pegged to CPI increase, which was at least somewhat predictable year to year."
alberta,3c90wv,BraveryInc,2,Mon Jul 6 15:27:06 2015 UTC,"$30/hr is not the ""living wage"".  That's $60,000/yr, and the mean income here is $40,400 according to stats Canada for 2013."

A large business like Walmart or a grocery store chain will move that money to their head office and won't spend it or as much of on the local economy.   Another benefit is that employees might be more productive if they earn more (the Costco effect, Costco pays more and has a lower turnover and better trained employees because of it)"

alberta,3c90wv,01209,5,Thu Jul 9 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"The other side of it would be that some employers are paying some employees less than they're worth, damaging the economy and increasing income equality."

Employees do all the work and create all the value, employers pay them as little as they can get away with. Yeah, its true that the employee can go work somewhere else, but they will still have to work for an employer who pays as little as they can get away with.  Employers have all the money and all the bargaining power, so they can get a more favourable deal for themselves."

You may feel you're work is worth more but until you find someone willing to pay you more your feelings and two bucks buys you a coffee.
alberta,3c90wv,Gears_and_Beers,2,Tue Jul 7 23:34:00 2015 UTC,"In a purely market context yes, the definition of worth is what someone is willing to pay. That's why it's insufficient. A small group of people own everything, a much larger group have to compete to get work, and given the imbalance of bargaining power between a single worker and a single employer, workers don't get paid what their labour is actually worth.  Besides that, it just seems like common sense that everyone who works for a living should make enough to live on."
alberta,3c90wv,VovaPoutine,2,Thu Jul 9 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"Employees are paid what they can sell themselves for in a very asymmetric market.  Their value and their cost are two very different numbers, and you're conflating them on purpose.  /u/elktamer said they're being paid less than they're worth, which is always true if the company is to stay in business.  If value was not higher than cost, employers wouldn't hire them at all.  He's suggesting that this difference is too high based on the obvious fact that Walmart is a huge successful company and the employees are not.  My argument would be that the margin isn't enough to make employees livelihoods increase meaningfully, and that Walmart makes their wealth on the number of these kinds of asymmetric interactions.  Basically, ""if I could steal a dollar from everyone"""
alberta,3c90wv,redditmoose,4,Wed Jul 8 12:16:07 2015 UTC,When you consider that employers also pay remittance on employees to essentially double what a 'labourer' costs per hour: It gets hard to hire that rookie. It gets even harder if you run a small operation

I do get to help with the month end and everything at my job, so I do see the sizable hit that we will take from these increases, but it needs to be done. If the other employees don't get a raise, then they have effectively become ""worth less.""  I don't think in the long run we will have to lay anyone off (because of the raises we are giving, for other reasons maybe in the near future), but I could definitely see local businesses letting people go, or halting their hiring until they can adjust their prices.  I think this is a really bad time for the increase because lots of these businesses won't want to raise their prices while the price of oil is down and there isn't much money circulating on small towns.

Yes that is ""lassere faire"" /s America but I would argue that even less people in Canada only make minimum wage (someone with better google powers can look this up); for example in Alberta right now a DQ burger flipper makes $14 starting. In Scandinavia, and the Germanic Countries (minus Germany now) do not have minimum wage and their societies are the best in the world.  Minimum wage is pointless when you have programs, such as the temporary foreign worker program, that gets around minimum wage laws anyway. Increasing automation means people will get replaced by robots if they do become too costly for a company.  All goods will see an increase in price and those not making minimum wage will see less value for their money."

I think the hardest part for at least some of the guys I worked with would be the interview and document submission.  They don't just give these jobs away like the oil field did when I was working in it ,most people who apply don't get hired and they always hire less people then they need. Obviously now it's a fight for all jobs but it wasn't when I was doing it."

alberta,3byn2t,TexasNorth,6,Sat Jul 4 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"How about best for protection of the area? I was down that trail last weekend, the border of McLean creek used to be at the bottom of that trail before the river. You were never supposed to bring vehicles to the falls, it was never much of a problem before since the trail was tight and the falls were hard to access. Since the floods trails have opened up access to the falls and areas of riverbed that now see truck and quad traffic more frequently. Now we have trucks and quads tearing up the river bed and banks, which are fragile areas. I'm not sure the incident you are referring to, but I'm sure this trail closure has everything to do with protecting the environment and little or nothing to do with whatever that incident is. I'm not sure if your familiar with how McLean and other Forest Land Use Zones work, trails are frequently closed at the discretion of Fish and Wildlife to recover and reclaim areas that are fragile or have seen overuse. There is nothing political about this trail closure.   No wonder you have such a bad reputation here."

Closing down over used easy access trails is the best way to keep people that don't treat the area with respect, out.

It is a tough go starting any small business in Canada, especially one selling products that will only attract a very precise demographic.  There is a trend towards healthier eating in North America right now, and sweets/sugar and bread are some of the first things people seem to be buying less of.   That said, Canadians are a fairly open minded lot, and generally willing open to new ideas.  Perhaps if you could put develop some type of a healthy twist to your sweets and breads, that may be effective.   I gave up bread a while back, but know that some of the vegetable breads seem to sell fairly well."

By no means are all companies going to get up and say ""fuck it! We're outta' here!"" But if Alberta become ""the same"" as Saskatchewan for investment, of course they are going to invest in a province that is booming just as hard or harder, and they know what they governments plans are.  I am by no means saying that what the NDP are doing, or what they stand for is wrong, but from an investment point of view it makes no sense to wait around for the government to maybe hopefully decide what they are doing, and when they do hopefully it is a good investment environment for companies.  But like I said earlier, there is no way these companies are going to just get up and leave, and they will probably follow through will all of their current and approved projects, but it's the future ones we need to be worried about."

It makes up a significant part of their economy, with most production coming from the western border. I've been there, I've worked there, have you been? Their reserves simply do not come close to what's under Alberta. Seriously, this shit is easy to look up. I told you already what's different: it's where the reserves are; that's what the map I linked shows...  Edit: Here's a nice number for you: Alberta has 98% of Canada's proven oil reserves.

No one is making the claim that the economy doesn't matter. What proof do you have that the tax increase will so clearly to you supersede the other costs of business like new transportation, infrastructure, transaction costs (contracts, ancillary businesses)? Most of the major oil players have headquarters in Calgary, where the managers have families and roots. Is it so easy to just switch provinces like changing your shoes?  Your assertion that oil production ends at the provincial border is insanely ignorant to me. You do realise that the ROI on oil is so high that they are already extracting and producing it wherever they can? I was just working the Co-op refinery shutdown in Regina, and it is a massive operation. How can you say that it's been killed in Saskatchewan? It's already a big industry there, just not as big as it is here (for a simple reason that I'm getting to). Do you know anything about the oil industry?  Your assertion that it's only naysayers that claim you can't move the oil is absurd. You really can't dude! Off the top of my head, there's the Peace River, Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Lloydminster reserves when it comes to oil sands, all almost completely within Alberta's borders. Like Alberta, Saskatchewan's conventional oil & gas is already developed, so all we're talking about here is new development, and minor developments, at that. Do you think that they can just pick up and move these massive operations? Do you think they will just shut down development on that new massive Redwater upgrader that a few companies have already poured millions into?

This, from a company that claims to be jumping ship. It's all words to get a better deal from the government. It's all just business, and you bought it: hook, line, and sinker."
alberta,3bstzv,BurninatorJT,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"Most of the bitching and butt hurt on here is positional mixed with some ideology. If some  business actually leaves they lose on opportunity here, whereas if they option into Saskatchewan they still are open to growth here.   Tight oil still abounds in Alberta and I don't know a single Canadian medium size operation that won't be busy as hell when oil hits that 65 dollar range again.   This publicized wrist wringing angst is pathetic as hell. Notley will get invited to a few barbecues and numbers will be tossed around and looked at in the review. Andrew Leach (review chair) will kick out a set of good numbers and it's back to work."
alberta,3bstzv,ApoliticalypseNow,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"Just because CNRL is still funding an already approved and started project doesn't mean anything. After the corporate tax increase, carbon tax increase, and royalty review the board of directors at CNRL will make the decision if Alberta is worth investing in. If it is, great not much changes. If it is not, they will keep funding their already developed projects, but they will shift the mass of their funding elsewhere."

alberta,3bozyy,Sidewinder77,6,Tue Jun 30 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no issue with the current state of the sub or any of the current mods. However, I've seen a lot of crazy mod stuff over the years in various subreddits. Although having mods is essential to run these subs, but it centralizes power and inherently creates opportunities for abuse.   In light of that and in the interest of keeping good checks & balances, encouraging diversity, and avoiding even the appearance of impropriety, can any mod that also moderates another major Albertan/Canadian subreddit voluntarily step down and leave the moderating to others? There's no need to be modding in more than one place related subreddit, and imo /r/Alberta and reddit in general would be a more robust place if this policy were applied.   Edit: clarification that I believe reddit would be a better place if the same mods did not mod related/default subreddits"
alberta,3bozyy,CPWX,2,Wed Jul 1 03:40:04 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. Canada Politics is a cesspit of juvenile mods abusing the petty amount of power they have because it's all they will ever have and Canada has been pretty bad in the past too. Shitty mods are one of the two biggest problems on reddit and it would be solved by setting the max number of subs run to two.

That they're able to see multiple opposing viewpoints and accept differences.  Still recognizing when something is damaging to the conversation.   I am taking advice."

alberta,3bozyy,Sidewinder77,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:21:59 2015 UTC,"I really only mod one sub that's active and has more than 1000 readers; /r/SelfDrivingCars. Four related subs on the topic re-direct to /r/SelfDrivingCars. The remaining four subs I mod are ones I thought would be cool topics and often started due to personal interest; /r/Geoengineering, /r/UnintendedConsequence, /r/anthropocene, /r/MundaneSingularity. Sometimes I've attempted to build up a following, but unfortunately due to lack of time I haven't given them as much attention as I would like and they've never really achieved a critical mass.   I should clarify; I don't generally see a large potential for abuse if people mod unrelated subs, especially if they are not large or 'default' in nature, and I don't object to that. Ie: someone might mod /r/Europe, /r/puppies, and /r/travel. No big deal. My comment is simply about laying a foundation where the chance of any potential future abuse between related subs will be minimized, and competition & experimentation will be maximized."

This thread on /r/Calgary yesterday was asking for sources to plan hikes - you should find a lot of useful links there.

Big Business will use this as a excuse to tack more profit as well.    Consider Gas Prices - price of oil (the primary ingredient) - cut in half vs last year.   Price of gas - approximately the same as it was last year.   (Paid $1.10/L the other day - which is what I think it was about a year ago). The market charges what the market will pay.    As a result - they will charge more for everything, because there is more $$$ in some of the population's pocket.     This will be incredibly inflationary IMHO.   And as a result, those of us who have  worked hard to be successful - this will be a net loss to them as they will not be getting 50% raises (equivalent to $10 -> $15) and goods/services will be significantly more expensive.  The other thing is that business will move to other jurisdictions.  If minimum wage is $10 in BC and $15 in Alberta - guess where the work is going to go?   I would be all for it - if all the jurisdictions in Canada were moving in the same direction.   Level playing field.

This move is very astute and tells more about Notley's government being more cautious and sawy than previously expected. Given the fall of the loonie, and prices adjusting an increase was due anyways. Yet, the $15 nonesense was problematic in a number of respects, this seems more in line with conservative policy. I like that there is an increase within reason, and that the timing is reflective of a willingness to listen with other interests- and- signals for  cooperation between government and private interest. Comes into place in October once the majority of the min wage earners are off the labor force ( students) and gives ample of time for restructuring wages and adjusting to the new marketplace for businesses. Yet, its also achieving something they promised and is a great compromise between rhetoric and policy. This pragmatism is good for the province and should be seen as a sign of an invitation for dialogue in the future between government and businesses. Some may see this as Notley selling out or pandering but I see this as good governance, as politics are not us versus them but rather about working towards a common goal. Just imagine had she pulled a higher increase before stampede, or once students have been making close to minimum for a month- chaos would have taken place and people been fired.

There are people who 'technically' make minimum wage and these are mostly waitresses (which is where the 62% are women comes from). These waitresses effective wage is closer to 20, 25 or even 30 dollars an hour.   So what we really have here is just an additional tax on people who like to go to restaurants. Because tipping culture is so messed up if I go to a restaurant and get a bill for $50, if I pay only the bill I am the scumbag of society. I recently was at decent resturant and they had those preset percentages on the debit machine, one of the options was 25%!   So restaurant owners have long expected the rest society to make up the wage gap for their employees through this arbitrary stupid tipping system. Raise the minimum wage the price on the menu will go up proportionally, and we'll still be expected to tip the same amount. So these waitresses will be making 25, 30 or even 35 dollars an hour.   We need to abolish mandatory tipping in restaurants and just set the real price on the menu. There are other systems where the restaurant owner shares a portion of the gross profit with staff so the incentive for service is maintained."

alberta,3bj2gi,EdmRealtor,6,Tue Jun 30 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Many reasons. It affects young people and also women more than men. It was initially targeted at bar/pub servers who can often take home over a hundred dollars in tips, but it ended up catching workers barely baking ends meet as a waitress at Humptys. It gives an unnecesary break to the restaraunt industry (who has, by the way, one of the most powerful lobby groups in the country). There was a group lobbying against the lower wages, with a good summary of their points here.   I think the next question we need to ask, is once our servers are making living wages, and the costs have been passed along to us as consumers with higher menu prices, what is to become of tipping in Alberta? Interesting times ahead."

alberta,3bn8p7,elktamer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"There's an Edmonton Journal article now. The minister's spokesperson said they can't comment for legal reasons which is probably true.   Assuming he was pardoned he technically doesn't have a criminal record. It's actually illegal when hiring someone to ask them if they have a record that was pardoned and illegal to not hire someone based on a pardoned offence (assuming the government even knew). It's also illegal in most cases for employers (including the government) to specifically comment about an employee like Ezra is demanding. Ezra may be annoying, but he's smart and a lawyer and he knows this. He knows that the government can't say anything about this.   Why he was given a pardon? I don't know. It used to be fairly easy to get one (it changed recently under Harper and they're called ""record suspensions"" now instead of pardons). It used to be that after committing some offences, serving your sentence and spending a few years without committing any new offences you could apply for a pardon. The Parole Board would look at your offence, look at how you've changed your life since then etc and decide whether to give you one or not. If you got one you technically don't have a record and if an employer asks if you have a criminal record you can legally answer no."
alberta,3bn8p7,AntonBanton,0,Tue Jun 30 21:23:29 2015 UTC,So basically anyone who committed a violent crime and has not re-offended can be assumed to be pardoned?
alberta,3bn8p7,elktamer,5,Wed Jul 1 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"Obviously it depends on the severity of the crime. I get the inkling you're using the phrase ""violent crime"" as a weasel word. Fights happen and sometimes don't get stopped when they should."
alberta,3bn8p7,dickMcWagglebottom,2,Wed Jul 1 00:10:33 2015 UTC,You used to be able to get pardoned for pretty much everything. Famous case example Graham James was pardoned for a sexual assault conviction.
alberta,3bn8p7,AntonBanton,0,Wed Jul 1 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"I get the inkling you're using the phrase ""violent crime"" as a weasel word.   I was using ""violent crime"" as opposed to ""non-violent crime"" which I thought was more likely to be pardoned. as /u/AntonBanton says, there's really no difference for who would have been pardoned.  What is a ""weasel word""?"
alberta,3bn8p7,elktamer,2,Wed Jul 1 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"That's not quite what I said, but it used to be relatively easy to get a pardon if you knew it was a possibility. Basically as long as you weren't a repeat offender, you did your time and hadn't committed a new offence you applied to the Parole Board for a pardon, said how you'd turn your life around and they gave you one. Someone who travels in the circles he does (with other university grads, government officials) is likely to have known that you could apply for a pardon.   I'm operating on the assumption that he got one because I find it hard to believe that working for two different provincial governments he was never subjected to a criminal record check. If he had one done it would have said he had no record.  Like I said, Levent is a lawyer, I'm sure he knows that it's likely Dancey got a pardon, and he also knows that the government legally can't respond to questions about a specific staff member.   The pardon system has changed now, and it's not as easy to get one now (they're ""record suspensions"" now not ""pardons.""), but he would have been eligible to apply for one years before the rules changed. I'd say it's safe to assume that he had applied for one and that the government had no way of knowing that he had once committed a crime, legally couldn't ask him if he'd ever had a pardon, and even if they had been aware of it it would have been illegal to discriminate against him based on a pardoned offence."

That is a perfectly reasonable request that environmental groups made for years and were ignored only until recently.   Reclamation exists but the previous government didn't enforce its own directive (074) that required tailings ponds to be cleaned up. Last year, they repealed it. Pure talk, little action.

alberta,3blffw,seldomsmith,5,Tue Jun 30 05:26:30 2015 UTC,"What the boosters of oil and gas don't get, is that the biggest reason for opposition to the oil sands is the perception that for oil & gas in Alberta, regulations are nothing but paper tigers.  Over and over again, people see spills and other accidents, and they don't see any moves to increase regulatory compliance.  On top of that, we have a free market loving federal government that accuses anyone who cares about the environment of being a foreign backed terrorist and until recently, a pro-industry provincial government, denying that there are issues with regulatory compliance, and there are companies that are less ethical who aren't being punished, or that anything needs to change at all. When our regulators are insiders, it looks like the fox is guarding the hen house, and nobody trusts us.  If we want people to stop criticizing our industry, and approve projects, we need to be more transparent, and willing work with environmentalists instead of vilifying them and dismissing real and valid concerns."

alberta,3bjww3,awaiiken,4,Mon Jun 29 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"Well....  If you're a small business owner that relies on minimum wage labour AND you're struggling, this might push you over the edge.  It will likely mean a few points of inflation on common goods.  A simple calculation would suggest the average meal at McDonalds will go up by $0.65 or so.  It will likely mean a boom of automation technology...some burger flippers will be out of work to robotics/automation.  People that work the same number of hours will see a signifigant increase in their take-home.  BUT - law of unintended consequences - will it mean they can't access some support mechanisms out there that once removed will eliminate (or worsen) their financial position?  I likely will cause an increase in purchasing power, which will help strengthen the overall economy, unless that gets offset by the perils (job losses/hour losses/automation/social programs).  So far, the places ""experimenting"" with the higher minimum wages are not seeing catastrophe - just a few businesses dying, a few taking their place, and an overall increase in the economy.  Odds are good this won't kill us, but there is a question of whether we're heaping too much at once...carbon tax, increased corporate tax, royalty review, minimum wage, etc etc etc - is it all too much too fast too soon?    Overall, it will probably be a good thing, but there absolutely is risk involved in the move."

alberta,3bjww3,WillieConway,4,Tue Jun 30 03:14:31 2015 UTC,"Part of the idea here (one supported by a lot of research, as the Parkland Institute points out) is that the increased minimum wage will increase consumer spending and benefit the economy from the ground up.  Basically, here's how it's meant to work. Neoliberal, supply-side economics says that you give tax breaks to the rich because they create jobs. This is the famous ""trickle down"" theory--rich people build factories (or whatever), and they hire workers.  The problem that has become increasingly apparent over the last 30 years is that a lot of these big investment projects don't happen. For example, a new call centre will get built, but built in, say, India because of the lower wages and labour protection there. Of course, lower wages means more profit for the shareholders, but it also means that job has been eliminated from Canada. That's the power of being wealthy in the modern world, with its lack of trade barriers.  Those jobs that got exported overseas are not coming back--nobody will start a Bic pen company in Alberta, or a clothes factory, or all that other stuff that's made mainly in South Asia. Who would have worked those jobs if they were in Canada? Minimum wage earners, of course.  So what's the government to do if big chunks of industry have picked up and moved? Well, one idea is raise the minimum wage that now exists. The workers who are here will get enough money to survive, but they will also have a little left over to spend on consumer goods. If you have, say, 5000 low-income earners who are able to afford little extras sometimes (the occasional trip to a restaurant, toys for the kids, etc), then they'll need to buy those things from local businesses. In turn, the local business sees an increase in its customer flow. The big advantage here compared to the supply-side economics mentioned above is that the minimum wage earners spend their money in Alberta. Unlike the wealthy investors, they're not going to suddenly move several millions out of the province (and probably the country).   So, the theory goes, the small business sees short-term losses by paying higher wages, but long-term gains. The critical thing to keep in mind here is that nobody is says it makes every single person happier. Some people will lose their jobs, and some small businesses might scale back and even close shop. However, what the NDP is arguing (and their argument is backed up by a wealth of empirical data) is that there will be more benefits overall."
alberta,3bjww3,JackOCat,3,Tue Jun 30 06:59:23 2015 UTC,Yep supply side vs demand side economics.  I personally think supply side is just a narcissistic libertarian fantasy... mostly anyway.
alberta,3bjww3,the_alberta_way,0,Tue Jun 30 15:25:12 2015 UTC,The simplest answer is no one will really notice in a macro sense. Those who make or pay minimum wage... There will be winners and losers.   The NDP type would argue more wage is good for people at the lowest incomes. The con type would argue more wages equals less jobs which is not good for the poor.

alberta,3bfmqa,Goredevil,3,Sun Jun 28 20:14:18 2015 UTC,Rent is fairly high in edmonton. All my landlord friends are able to rent detached homes out for atleast $300 more per month than their mortgage payments.  Decent homes in edmonton in average neighbourhoods are $375-$550k.  Which isn't bad because average households make $100k a year in edmonton.

As far as rent and work, we're in a bit of a recession right now so without knowing what industry you have experience in make sure you have jobs lined up before you come.  I've been unemployed since January and I'm still looking for work.   Housing isn't that cheap here and a run down fixer upper starts at 350k and a house that's ready to move in starts at 425k so expect rent on a 3 bedroom starting around 1500 to 2500 depending on location and your tolerance for living in a shit hole   So realistically you'd want to save the cost of moving and a few months living expenses"
alberta,3bfmqa,theoreoman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:13:38 2015 UTC,Have you seen what a detached home costs in Vancouver? Edmonton is way more affordable. It's within the realm of possibility to buy a house here for the average joe. You need a cool $1mil at least for a beat up junker on its own land in Vancouver. That's the cost of land there. We are lucky out here :) our wages are much higher too.
alberta,3bfmqa,differentimage,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:00:24 2015 UTC,I would agree with the Uhaul route. Also if you are moving for work you can deduct a certain amount of these expenses from your taxes.   If you are needed a three bedroom house for short term I may have something for you depending on when you are planning on arriving.  Honestly other than boyle street we have nothing that is uber sketchy compared to parts of vancouver. Try kijii for rentals and maybe https://www.uship.com/ca/ for the move.

""Well if you don't want to pay 50% tax rates, feel free to move somewhere with lower taxes, like SOMALIA!""  You're god damn right I don't want to pay half of what I earn into subsidizing your bullshit, socialist utopia.  Tax freedom day in Canada is in the MIDDLE OF FUCKING JUNE.  For you 'low information voter' liberal types, that's roughly HALF OF THE GOD DAMN YEAR that you (presumably) and I work to be able to afford all of the 'free' things that our government does for us.  You're god damn right that I want to pay less tax, but that I also recognize that an income tax (or my favorite, a consumption tax) is required and necessary - I just don't think that it needs to be near exactly half of my fucking income.    Here's an idea:  If, for whatever reason, you favour 50%+ tax rates, maybe YOU should move your ass to fucking Sweden, or Norway, or whatever Eurofag country you liberals are touting this week as 'the government model that we need to implement to solve all of our problems.'  30% tax rates are too fucking high.  50% is just outright corruption and incompetence; but you liberals seem to love supporting corruption and incompetence for some reason."

Nor is it the middle of June. Yes, I know, it's close. But it's not that MIDDLE OF FUCKING JUNE and definitely not HALF OF THE GOD DAMN YEAR (your words).  And that's for Canada. Alberta is different. So you have to calculate tax freedom day for Alberta, using our tax brackets. And the tax you pay is dependent on how much you earn (tax freedom day is actually different for everyone - so it's a fun indicator, but shouldn't be taken that seriously).  Even with the NDP changes (and these are the maximum ones they've indicated for the future), if you earn $225,000, your combined income tax for Provincial and Federal is 38.5%.   Oh hell, I know your problem. The language they use is ""progressive"" income tax. And progressive is one of your trigger words.

It showed them try to call people to pick some of them up or try to take some of the homeless people to shelters first (who were often rejected because they were just about to pass out drunk) and the drunk tank was a last resort. They also seemed to basically just hand out public intoxication when they were on Jasper to people who were being belligerent - which might be a better alternative than a charge for causing a disturbance under the criminal code.   Again, that's just what they showed some members of one police force on TV. I have no idea how that reflects the actual reality of how most situations are handled."

It's appropriate for the state to protect other people from you, but it isn't appropriate for the state to 'protect' you from yourself.  The only real question is whether 'public' intoxication can be shown to have cause harms to other people, and whether those harms rise to a level appropriate to state intervention.

When transporting large qua ties of crude over large distances it's just plain ignorance to think that a pipeline isn't the best way to do it.   You can debate the need or desire to transport the oil but if the oil is moving a pipeline is the best way.   People honestly think that f pipelines don't get built the oil will somehow stay in the ground.

alberta,3b3b50,Ashlir,-7,Thu Jun 25 20:36:50 2015 UTC,Scale matters. Read the links I provided. One container or truck at a time is nothing compared to pipelines that leak for months or decades and that destroy entire aquifers. But as long as it isn't in your back yard. Right? As long as it is someone else's problem. The collective can't be bothered with destroying people's private property and means of existence. This is the land where your food comes from.

The thing is, they are betting against the sub prime mortgages held by ""private"" companies these are relatively small. The failure of this market may affect those who maybe should not be buying a house in the first place. Although some are still paying for past misdeeds even though they have cleaned up their act. This is not USA 2.0.  This comment also struck me: “A house is something you live in, but in Vancouver you guys are trading them like the penny stocks on Howe Street.  Edmonton had its run in with this style of home buying in 2007. The condos that still have not recovered since are an indicator of a failed bet. They were expecting vancouver style gains and were getting them until it flipped over. Vancouver has been an insane market forever and it does not look like much will change that in the future. But note I have seen lately a lot more foreclosures in condos especially lately. These have been a result of special assessments and maintenance that could no longer be deferred.

alberta,3aywdg,silversunday,2,Wed Jun 24 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"The survey is actually quite biased as some business owners in the comments pointed out. Take question number 8 for example.   The plan to increase the minimum wage to $15 is actually within the next four years (2015/2016/2017/2018).  AB Chambers really should know better than to skew the facts toward a certain outcome.  For question 8 and 9 they also left out any response options for people who have neutral or positive opinions on the increase to the minimum wage.  As you'll notice there are no options for businesses who pay well above the minimum wage, as changes would have very little impact on them."
alberta,3aywdg,EdmRealtor,4,Thu Jun 25 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"The real problem is with the rate of the increase in my opinion.  People think all these places in the states instituted the new 15 dollar minimum wage overnight. This is not true it is a slow process. In Seattle they differentiate between big and small business. Giving small business the ability to pay a lower rate than a big company (Over 500). This is a great idea but it is one that has not been mentioned or hinted at yet, They also want to get rid of the two tiered system which is not inherently bad since it identifies groups that can benefit from extra income through their work similar to a commissioned sales person.  The other thing I would wish to see is the transference of power of minimum wage to the municipalities. You cannot tell me small town Alberta is as expensive to live in as Edmonton, Calgary , Ft. Mac. It is pretty shortsighted to think that this can only be good but it wont be all bad either."

alberta,3aywdg,EdmRealtor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:45:38 2015 UTC,Do you need to own a car in a small town? People who are on minimum wage or close to it may find it difficult to own a vehicle. Transit does not exist but You likely can walk to work. As for entertainment  there may not be as much but it likely tends to be cheape. Food prices are similar to the cities due to places like Walmart. Rents also tend to be lower or at least house prices are not what they are in the cities for most part. These all things that make it cheaper to live and work in a small town. This holds true for small towns that are not as dependent on the oil and gas sector. Those have othe pressures that can cause cost of living to be higher    It was a generality. Not a rule and may be wrong just an opinion after all.   edit: words
alberta,3aywdg,EdmRealtor,2,Thu Jun 25 13:05:53 2015 UTC,"I live in a town of about 10,000 people. I definitely need a vehicle. Walking to work is just not practical. Generally, there is not as much entertainment, so it is cheaper in the regard that it is not available. Most people camp, fish, or quad for entertainment if they can afford it.  Things like gas is much more expensive, and groceries are much more expensive as well. Out of the 5 towns near me, there is two Wal-Marts which do not have groceries, or very little amounts. The grocery stores are stuck to Safeway's and the such which are very inflated.  I will say that rent is generally cheaper here from what I have experienced. I have lived downtown Edmonton for my whole time living there, so a 2 bedroom apartment is around $1750-$2200 a month for rent. Where as for that same price in my area you can rent a duplex for that much.  Housing prices are unbelievably cheaper in Edmonton. It absolutely blows my mind how cheap houses are there. In my area a brand new 5 bedroom house will run you $450,000+  Although, one thing to offset some of this is the pay is MUCH higher in small town in my opinion. The pay in Edmonton is nothing compared to small towns."
alberta,3aywdg,g_gundy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:16:23 2015 UTC,A  brand new five bedroom house in Edmonton that is located in an area far removed from the core would not be significantly cheaper if at all cheaper than 450k.

alberta,3aw1uv,SexualPredat0r,15,Tue Jun 23 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"The two major loopholes the WRP is referring to.   Unions and corporations can continue to guarantee loans to political parties, and they can donate their employees paid time."
alberta,3aw1uv,canadient_,3,Wed Jun 24 00:40:17 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree in principal but I'm a little concerned that the wildrose amendment proposals might be a little shortsighted...   Banning corporations from guaranteeing loans and donating employee time is potentially opening up a large grey area of unenforceable rules and unintended consequences.  For cashflow a business/party/whatever needs a line of credit and someone has to guarantee that line of credit.   Otherwise you get into situations where a minor banking delay means your employees can't be paid.    If you exclude corporations then a wealthy individual or group of individuals would need to be the guarantor.  Getting a lender to accept a large group of low income guarantors is extremely problematic, so would this exclude candidates/parties that are supported by low income voters?  Does the change require a party/candidate to attach themselves to a wealthy guarantor in order to cashflow their campaign?   Can a party supporting lender just not require a guarantor and then just write down the loan as a loss?  How do you enforce donated employee time anyways?  If you're going to enforce this you need to be incredibly specific in the regulation.  Are salaried employees on paid leave included?  Does that include discounted services?  Are we going to audit private enterprise or demand disclosure of their historical pricing?  If a worker paid by the party works late, does that count as donated employee time?"
alberta,3aw1uv,FinalDetail,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:05:12 2015 UTC,Id be interested to see how employee time would be monitored. Would people sitting at their desk posting articles for or against government or opposition policies count as donated time? Where does the line get drawn?

I'm not aware of anyone using these programs to volunteer for political parties,  nor of employers exerting pressure on employees to volunteer for any particular cause other than united way. )   I think Jean had an answer in search of a problem,  but I'm not to fused about it in any case."

Honestly, 100 seems ludicrously long considering how fast renewable energies are catching on elsewhere.

God forbid, SA decides to play hardball and keep this going for 10 years that day could well be today.

We're helping keep people employed (contractors & staff), and finally getting a deal on the work we need done.  And when you start to look province-wide, when the cost to borrow some funds to do infrastructure work is lower than the inflationary cost to wait & do it once the economy heats up again, it makes sense for everyone to build now.  It keeps the economy going in tough times, and it gives us even after borrowing costs a much better bang for the buck.  Win-fucking-win no matter how much the libertarians want to rail against it."

NDP ethics seem to have different rules depending if you're on team orange or not. I was just taking a stab at the next logical step..."
alberta,3aucg9,weecdngeer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:07:36 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I'm not sure it's an apt comparison. The reason I say that is the apparent discrepancy between mandate and performance in the AER looks like classic examples of regulatory capture, which involves the compromising of regulatory bodies in the interest of private gain.   In the case of the NDP, it's not clear how having an anti-pipeline lobbyist (for example) onstaff serves private gain--unless, of course, we know he's got stock in an oil truck company or something like that. In fact, it's entirely reasonable to think such people serve the public interest by resisting the enormous influence that profits tends to exert on government affairs."
alberta,3aucg9,WillieConway,2,Wed Jun 24 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"I would argue that there are other ways by which individuals can benefit other than direct financial gains.  I also don't believe that the role of the energy ministry, or any other economic ministry, is to act as an adversary to the industry.  Write the rule book and play referee, sure... but none of our collective goals (industry and province) are advanced by implementing unneccessarily complex and cumbersome regulatory regimes.  The focus should be on setting strict and measurable rules that are difficult /impossible to game, but consistent and transparent to industry and the public. That is not aligned with the tactics of anti energy ngos like mitchell's."
alberta,3aucg9,weecdngeer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:58:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that the job of a regulator is to make clear rules and achievable targets, and otherwise they should keep their distance. That said, where is the conflict you envision in Mitchell's work with LeadNow? The bulk of the group's activity is social-media awareness about a variety of issues (environmental protection, strategic voting, etc). They don't work on specific policy adjustments in a single industry the way a regulator would. Certainly there is not the confused mandate of the AER (blending energy advocacy with supposed environmental protection). And they have nothing remotely similar to having a former executive of a private industry now (supposedly) monitoring that same industry for any excesses it might have.  A regulator is not meant to take an automatic adversarial role to an industry, but then the question is ""adversial according to whom?""  Publicly traded companies will never, ever frame a potential reduction of shareholders' investments as anything except bad. That's not to say they are evil people, but the mandate of a board of directors is to maximize returns on investments. They could be dismissed for failing to perform their duty if they didn't fight tooth and nail against any curtailing of profits. To me, it's clear enough that LeadNow's advocacy is only adversarial to oil companies to the extent that they call out such industries environmental abuses and political interference. They work in the public interest, in other words, not for private gain at the expense of public interest.   Regulators should not be inherently adversarial, but they must be willing to bump heads with the industry they regulate; otherwise what's the point? What we really should worry about and focus on are the times when regulators seem to advocate for the industries they are meant to keep in check, like the AER appears to do."
alberta,3aucg9,WillieConway,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"That said, where is the conflict you envision in Mitchell's work with LeadNow?    LeadNow, along with a multitude of other similar organizations, have had a significant focus on the oilsands for quite some time now. The goal of these organizations (sometimes literally stated, sometimes implied) is to shut down the oilsands. They have no desire to listen to science, abide by regulations or compromise in any way to solutions that work for industry and citizens. They apparently have no qualms in misrepresenting the truth to gain support for their position.  Case in point - LeadNow's anti-Energy East campaign. They claim they are asking for the NEB to ""include climate impacts and community voices"". These things are already integrated into the review. The NEB's review addresses the emissions, etc. of the facilities being constructed, and there is a well defined (and very challenging) public consultation process and process for hearings.  What they mean, is that they want Transcanada's project to bear the burden of the entire oil sands industry, which is entirely outside of the legal mandate of the NEB and wholly outside of Transcanada's control. ""Community voices"" is referring to the NEB's recently changed policy to restrict oral hearings to those directly impacted by the project (in response to the environmentalists flying in from the states to testify at the Gateway hearings, dragging out the process and incurring a massive amount of cost). But the petition on LeadNow implies that TCPL and the NEB are pushing this project through with no input from the affected communities.     Certainly there is not the confused mandate of the AER (blending energy advocacy with supposed environmental protection).   Despite digging through the AER's website, I see no mandate/goal to promote or advocate for the industry, and I certainly have seen no evidence of this in working in the industry.  Their mandate is ""The AER’s mandate is to ensure the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans.."" No reference to promotion, advocacy, growth, etc. Do you have any reference to where this promoting the industry mandate is?    And they have nothing remotely similar to having a former executive of a private industry now (supposedly) monitoring that same industry for any excesses it might have.   I'm not at all sure what you're referring to as 'excesses'. The role of the regulator is to develop rules that are quantifiable and leave little room for interpretation. Are you implying that a former executive who is now on the AER's payroll would turn a blind eye to companies exceeding regulatory limits for emissions, water use, etc.?    That's not to say they are evil people, but the mandate of a board of directors is to maximize returns on investments.    But we're talking about an individual who has quit their corporate role and is now being paid by the AER. And who as an executive with the regulator should be held accountable to specific, measurable targets. (Protti's are here, pg 22 and 23](http://aer.ca/documents/reports/201314_AERAnnualReport.pdf). Are you saying that because someone had an objective to make a profit for their last employer, they'll somehow feel obligated to continue to try and make this employer / industry profitable?  I see it as a huge advantage to have someone who understands the corporations from the inside but is playing on 'our side' (taxpayers and citizens), as they'll have a solid understanding of when the industry b/s-ing the cost impacts, challenges, etc. of proposed regulatory changes.   To me, it's clear enough that LeadNow's advocacy is only adversarial to oil companies to the extent that they call out such industries environmental abuses and political interference. They work in the public interest, in other words, not for private gain at the expense of public interest   We will have to agree to disagree on that one. I believe some in the anti-energy advocacy sector have legitimate concerns, some are naive and a small group are spinning up the public / advocacy groups for their own profit.   Regulators should not be inherently adversarial, but they must be willing to bump heads with the industry they regulate; otherwise what's the point?   I don't support the premise that having an industry background makes someone in any way, shape or form unwilling to 'bump heads' with the industry. Anyone leading a regulator should be incented to reach measurable targets for emissions, safety, water use, etc.  If they don't meet them, fire them. If they are in a conflict of interest, fire them.   My concern with Mitchell is that his objective is to 'advise' our very green energy minister. Given that his advocacy background was known to Notley when she hired him, I can only conclude that's the direction that the 'advice' will be heading and his goals are set accordingly.   advocate for the industries they are meant to keep in check, like the AER appears to do.   any citation on this?"
alberta,3aucg9,weecdngeer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"I like your style of arguing, and while I'd like to do a line-by-line consideration of points, there's just not enough time, so I'll try to cut to the chase  There are basically two intertwined issues we're discussing: (1) does the Alberta Energy Regulator warrant a review and (2) are the NDP hypocrites (a corollary [2b?] is the extent to which LeadNow and its former employees can be trusted to fairly represent the industries that discuss.)  I'm going to stick just to (1) not only because that's the topic of the thread, but also because it seems to be a more concrete issue.  I'm in favour of reviewing their mandate and structure. Here are some reasons why.  First, the AER is young just three years old. Before it was founded, Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (a government entity) dispensed permits. The development of the AER took energy sector regulation out of the government hands entirely. Instead, ""The AER is 100 per cent funded by industry and is authorized to collect funds through an administrative fee levied on oil and gas well, oilsands, and coal mines"" source. In itself, this funding model should give us pause. I'm not saying it's a smoking gun, and maybe the AER is able to maintain impartiality. All I'm saying here is that we should at least consider the possibility that the AER might face identity problems if it is supported by that which it is meant to regulate.  It's this exact funding issue that gives a muddy appearance to the mandate of the AER. Of course, as you rightly quoted, their stated mandate is ""to ensure the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans."" Of course, those two fairly vague sentences don't really provide much in the way of explaining what the AER is really supposed to do or how it will do it.  And in fact, since the AER was created, public discussion forums on proposed projects have become less frequent, not more: see here and here. This very avoidance of consultation is not an accident, either. Rachel Notey herself (when she was environment critic) among others predicted this lack of transparency when the AER was first created source  Finally, we come to AER's Chair, Gerry Protti. Here's what you said:   Are you saying that because someone had an objective to make a profit for their last employer, they'll somehow feel obligated to continue to try and make this employer / industry profitable? I see it as a huge advantage to have someone who understands the corporations from the inside but is playing on 'our side' (taxpayers and citizens), as they'll have a solid understanding of when the industry b/s-ing the cost impacts, challenges, etc. of proposed regulatory changes.   I'm definitely not asserting that he is corrupt, impartial, etc. In fact, I know very little about the man or the job he's doing. What I am saying is that it's not unreasonable to suggest that a former industry profit-earner might have a skewed perspective not appropriate to the position of a regulator. You suggest that his expertise makes him a good fit--that's a best-case scenario, and if that is indeed true, then great. I'm saying it wouldn't hurt to dig into the structure of AER a little more to at least figure out if they are doing the jobs they say they are. The term ""regulator capture"" was invented for a reason--one of which is because de jure regulators frequently end up becoming de facto promoter. There is simply too much scholarship on this matter to require a specific source--just Google it.  You seem to think I have been claiming that the AER is totally corrupt, but I'm not. I'm saying it's possible, and a review is a pretty good idea."
alberta,3aucg9,WillieConway,2,Thu Jun 25 03:54:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I enjoy a good, rational debate.   Instead, ""The AER is 100 per cent funded by industry and is authorized to collect funds through an administrative fee levied on oil and gas well, oilsands, and coal mines"" source. In itself, this funding model should give us pause.    This is a good thing for Alberta taxpayers. The administrative fee is a clear and transparent way of forcing the industry to pay for the costs the government bears in regulating it. If a particular company drills a lot of wells, that puts a significant administrative burden on the government. If this administrative fee wasn't in place the costs would be born by the tax payer, effectively subsidizing industry growth. I see this as no different than the user fees we pay everyday... the fact that a builder pays a fee for a building permit doesn't make the City of Calgary beholden to them.   And in fact, since the AER was created, public discussion forums on proposed projects have become less frequent, not more: see here and here. This very avoidance of consultation is not an accident, either.    The consultation processes in both the NEB and the AER have become much more structured as a result of anti-energy advocacy groups, many of the foreign, treating every hearing as a platform whether or not they are impacted by the project.  Have the restrictions gone too far? maybe? Then the policy can be fine tuned (and has been per your first link on the reversal on the Southern Pacific hearing)   Rachel Notey herself (when she was environment critic) among others predicted this lack of transparency when the AER was first created source.    There seems to be a theory that the longer an issue is studied the better the results will be. I reject this. The AER was developed to improve efficiencies within regulatory process. Streamlining the system is good for all those involve and improved transparency. Having multiple agencies conducting simultaneous reviews of overlapping jurisdictions just increases the potential for companies to play free and loose with the rules.   industry profit-earner   You say that like it's a dirty word :)   might not have the objectivity that we want from our industry regulator.    I truly do not understand this sentiment. My allegiance is to my employer. I used to work for a consulting firm. When I worked for them, I made decisions that improved that company's profitability. I now work for a company that uses the same consulting services.  I work to support my new company's objectives, but my knowledge of my former employer's strategy greatly improves my ability to negotiate in my current employer's favour. If I were to move to a non-profit job next, the same would apply. I really don't understand at all why it would be a detriment, short of explicit conflicts of interest. ie. if he bought/sold stocks of a company that was pending AER decision.  Could someone who worked on be constantly pushing for their buddies? sure, anything is possible. But the likelihood is much, much higher in my opinion that any professional would use their skills and experience to the benefit of their current employer. For Notley to refer to the hiring of a respected professional from an industry that employs a huge number of Albertans as ""appalling"" is unreasonable and blatant hypocrisy coming from an individual who felt there was no conflict in hiring lobbyists to advise key ministers.   I'm saying it wouldn't hurt to dig into the structure of AER a little more to at least figure out if they are doing the jobs they say they are.    I don't disagree in principle. In this particular instance, given the current market conditions, the vast number of albertans losing their jobs, the upcoming royalty reviews, environmental policy changes, regulatory policy changes, the concerns re: transportation options, etc. this smacks of kicking the industry while it's down. And that industry is the cash cow of the province. The time isn't right."
alberta,3aucg9,weecdngeer,4,Thu Jun 25 04:57:47 2015 UTC,"How is this a bad thing?  ""review"" and ""change"" are different things, and people keep FREAKING OUT! about the word review. She might change this, or perhaps after review she might not. In order to understand something, you need to do research and ""review"" that research. Same with a royalty review, and I'm willing to bet if she changes that, she'll actually make it less convoluted and that might actually be a good thing for O&G since our royalty system is needlessly complicated."
alberta,3aucg9,keepcalmdude,3,Tue Jun 23 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"remember that ""fatigue of change"" issue that the NDP used as their rationale for keeping AHS' structure as-is? the same applies here to the energy sector. We're taking an incredibly bad downturn and adding more confusion with changing royalty rates, environmental policies (structure / strategy TBD), regulatory policies structure / strategy TBD) and then making it worse by bringing the structure of the regulator up for discussion as well.     But hey, it's big, bad oil, so eff'em, right?"
alberta,3aucg9,weecdngeer,0,Wed Jun 24 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"So with that logic we should do everything the same way as always, regardless of if it works well for the province and the corporations because.... ""We've always done it this way""? An effective government, or an effective corporation is forever questioning and examining the way they do business. And when an imbalance or inefficiency is found, they work to solve that issue."
alberta,3aucg9,keepcalmdude,2,Wed Jun 24 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"And when an imbalance or inefficiency is found, they work to solve that issue.   Agreed. But trying to tackle too many changes at once can cripple an organization. Generally there's some level of prioritization and some concern for keeping the existing systems operating while the the change is happening. Too much change and an organization will grind to a halt; no one wants to work on a project they think is going to get canned once the new change is announced.  Notley seems to be taking a scatter shot approach. Change all the things! we don't know when, we don't know how, but it'll be so much better."

""Ooooh, surprise, this person is a political appointee! How can he be fair and impartial!"" the Chief-of-Staff is a POLITICAL position in the Ministry. He runs the Minister's office. He keeps the Minister's calendar. He annotates the Minister's briefing book and maybe writes the Minister's speeches. He certainly vets those speeches. And he is almost always a party loyalist.  Jim Prentice broke the mold by appointing Mike Percy, a former Liberal MLA as his chief of staff. Worked real well for him.  Ralph Klein's chief of staff was Rod Love. Did any of you ever meet Rod Love? Talk about partisan pit bull, Rod Love checked whether you pissed party blue before you got into the same room as Ralph.  Also, no professional staff in the Ministry report to the Chief of Staff. They all report to the Deputy Minister, via an ADM in most cases. The Chief of Staff oversees the Communications staff.

How can she be impartial? Her last job was at that hotbed of socialist study, Simon Fraser University, which is NOT IN ALBERTA."" See how easy it is?

Is it because the NDP is in charge and can do no wrong?  Even when they're obviously in the wrong?

So in this case Clark didn't have the ability to take himself off the list since he was registered by the AFL as one of heir employees. Sounds like Clark did what he could by asking the AFL to remove him.   I'm not surprised the AFL is behind on stuff.

alberta,3ar7bb,Snake-Oil,6,Tue Jun 23 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"Do you know the history of residential schools?  They removed kids from their parents, their families and their culture. Forcibly removed. Their only option was to attend residential schools. Once there, they couldn't speak their language. Some were sterilized. Scientists did nutritional studies on kids, depriving some of food. Some were sexually and physically abused. Thousands of kids died. Their parents weren't informed.  Attendance was compulsory until 1948 (if I was First Nations, my dad would have been forced to attend). I have a friend who assisted in going through the records and reports of what went on in the Residential schools. They said they were reading a report and thinking ""well, this person had it quite easy."" Then realized what that person actually went through, and it only seemed easy because of all the other atrocities in comparison. My friend realized they had to get out of that job.  Do you understand childhood development? Do you understand what happens to kids that are forcibly taken from parents at that young of an age? It actually affects brain development. What kind of parents do you think they were when they grew up? Especially when they lived in a society that didn't acknowledge that history for decades. Or provide any support or counseling.   Society may not be responsible for ensuring a good life. But it sure doesn't have a right to do those atrocities.  But yeah, I'm sure your childhood was rough too."

alberta,3ar7bb,Snake-Oil,4,Tue Jun 23 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"This isn't a group of Canadians that are poor. This is a group of Canadians raised by parents who went through this. That means it is not just reflected in some past history hundreds of years ago, you have an entire group in modern society that is impacted by this.  Imagine your parents were taken from your grandparents at the age of 5 and six. And so were your uncles and aunts, and every relative you had, plus the majority of your friends parents and aunts and uncles. Some were malnourished. Some were raped. But all of them were taken from their families.  Now, at the age of 18, they get thrown into society. Plus, there is no indication that they (or their families or their friends) went through this. It's not even that it's denied. It's not even acknowledged. In fact, many of the stuff you read talk about how great Canada treated the First Nations compared to the evil stuff the United States did.   Yes, some of those people that went through that may be able to recover. The vast majority will have SEVERE issues. And I'm not talking about just emotional trauma. Actual physical problems related to brain development. Many of them wouldn't know how to nurture. They would make horrible parents. They would make poor decisions. Alcoholism (and therefore FASD) would be abnormally high (along with other addictions). Many of them would never be able to function in society. But they still had kids.  That's a modern problem. Not something that happened hundreds of years ago. This problem is still Canada's problem.  The first step is acknowledgement. That is one thing that those who liberated the camps in Germany understood. That if nothing was revealed, there would be people who wouldn't believe it because of how horrible it was.   The second step is proper support for those impacted by the residential schools. And that's not money thrown at them. And what the entails... I'm not really sure. I know that it involves providing support to rediscover lost culture, support for families, and a hope that the cycle is broken.  Seriously though, you have to understand that comparing someone who grew up poor is very different from a group of people who were forced into residential schools for generations."

Every political party has a platform that appeals to companies or unions, and honestly if the platform isn't appealing to any company or union then the platform will most likely hurt the economy.  Now that they have passed the bill that there is no corporate or union funding, why can't an individual fund the party with as much money as they want. Why does it matter if the head of a union gives NDP $100,000 for funding, or a business owner gives $100,000 to the Wild Rose.  I understand that you are saying then money has too much of an influence on the politics, but the campaigns are going to be extremely difficult to get to all people in Alberta if they are limited on how much money they can receive."

alberta,3awfdj,dickMcWagglebottom,4,Wed Jun 24 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia   Democratic socialists and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations, rooted in Marxism's ""scientific"" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors, has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life. After Marx's death, and with the emergence of Marxism, there have additionally been dissensions within Marxism itself- the splitting of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks a notable example. ""Orthodox"" Marxism became counterposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even revisionist Marxism.   So. Tell me. Are they Socialists or Marxists? They can't be both since they're completely different.I'll help you out, they're social democrats which if we're being semantic aren't socialists but for arguments sake I'll give you that they're basically the same ideas. Unless Petro Canada and Cenovus were recently purchased by the government of Alberta I'm pretty sure we're a long ways from actual socialism though.  I am genuinely curious though where you got the Marxist thing from. I for one have never seen any North American politician call for a violent class war, least of all Nenshi or Notley. If we're going to specifically call them Marxists instead of any of the other 50 types of communism then clearly there has to be some connection with the only major or unique feature of marxism which is the violent revolution part.  So I guess my question is when you've ever seen any North American politician ask the public to engage in a violent class war, because I missed it but that sounds like something I'd want to hear about."

I prefer statist the most, but few recognize what the term truly means.  People know what Communists are - they don't typically know what a statist is.

Paradise Hill  St Paul   The cases are similar to a rash of mutilations in southern Alberta in 1979 in which animals had their eyes, tongues and sex organs removed. Calgary police show 38 confirmed cases between August 1979 and the summer of 1980. A few cases of mutilations were confirmed in Saskatchewan at the same time.

alberta,3aew46,Not47,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:02:37 2015 UTC,Actually paying for public health resources for drug users is not only humane but its far more cost effective for the taxpayer. As an example it will cost about 1 million dollars to treat every new instance of HIV (in Alberta) vs under $5 for a pack of clean needles. Similarly sending addicts to jail is also more expensive than housing them (a month in jail is about $4000 vs a month in social housing is about $1000).  By allowing addicts to administer an overdose kit to themselves you are decreasing the likelihood of a lengthy (and expensive) hospital stay that ties up resources that can be used to help others.

This report examines the most recent wave of this research – roughly since 2000 – to determine the best current estimates of the impact of increases in the minimum wage on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. The weight of that evidence points to little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage.  The report reviews evidence on eleven possible adjustments to minimum-wage increases that may help to explain why the measured employment effects are so consistently small. The strongest evidence suggests that the most important channels of adjustment are: reductions in labor turnover; improvements in organizational efficiency; reductions in wages of higher earners (""wage compression""); and small price increases.  Given the relatively small cost to employers of modest increases in the minimum wage, these adjustment mechanisms appear to be more than sufficient to avoid employment losses, even for employers with a large share of low-wage workers."

alberta,3ad3el,Applberrie,3,Sat Jun 20 06:06:31 2015 UTC,"They are tax brackets, so you pay 15% on everything over $300k. You still pay 10% on the first $125k even if you are a millionaire."

Those taxes were one of the (smaller) reasons I was so against Prentice in that election.

alberta,3ad3el,Oplexus,3,Fri Jun 19 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"Even with this new rate, Alberta will maintain an overall competitive advantage when compared to other provinces, with no sales tax, no health-care premiums and the lowest fuel tax in Canada,'' said Ceci.   In other words, they'll be using oil money to subsidize artificially low taxes, which is exactly what they and the rest of the left have spent the last 3 decades complaining about."
alberta,3ad3el,SUBREDDITMODERATOR,4,Fri Jun 19 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, many progressives are against sales taxes and government service user fees, as they disproportionately affect the working poor more than the wealthy.

alberta,3ad3el,LTerminus,7,Fri Jun 19 03:45:02 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you're talking about.  People relocate their homes, businesses and assets to avoid higher taxes all the time.

Are you going to move to B.C, and pay PST? Or try to pay rent in a city like Vancouver, which has one of the most over-inflated real estate markets in the world? Are you going to move to the Maritimes, where there are no jobs? Quebec, where taxes are even higher and wages are not nearly as high? Ontario? Try finding a high paying energy-related job there. Or try finding a place to live in Toronto, if you can afford it that is. I'm sure you can get a job in their non-existent manufacturing sector. Or Manitoba, which is an NDP stronghold?   So that leaves Saskatchewan and the territories I guess. And Saskatchewan doesn't have a flat tax rate like we do, so if you're rich you're still paying more taxes. So go ahead, move. Just don't expect your high wages and lower rent prices to go with you. In reality, 99% of people who this affects are going to whine and complain, and then get used to it, because Alberta still has one of the highest median wages in the country. I'm sorry, but in a society where the middle class is rapidly disappearing, I couldn't care less if some rich old fogey can't afford his weekly excursion to the country club for high tea."

They don't have to move themselves, they can move their primary address or even just the money itself.  This is why it's called capital flight and not emigration.    Higher taxes decrease ROI which means lower tax jurisdictions become more attractive for investment since it can now generate higher returns, so that's where the money goes.  10% of something is still better than 15% of nothing and sometimes taxing things at a lower rate generates more overall money.  The concern here is that they will actually reduce rather than raise the amount of money they're trying to collect and it seems most economists think the NDP's move is going to be harmful to government revenue or, at the most optimistic, will only balance out and accomplish nothing."

alberta,3ad3el,Loire55,5,Fri Jun 19 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"France's tax system is vastly different than ours.  The tax that was repealed was a 75% tax on income above $1M euros.  75% isn't even close to rates we are talking about in Alberta.  Also, there were underlying factors such as a wealth tax in France where people are also taxed on the total value of personal assets.  We only have an income tax here."

The guy is by no means a banker, or born into money. He's just an engineer who made his way up the totem pole. He doesn't have ludicrous savings just a high wage for the high skill position he fills. This isn't a woe is me story, he'll still be fine if he stays, and I, myself, don't disagree with the tax hike,  I'm just pointing out that people really are considering there options.  It's not a given people are rooted to Alberta."
alberta,3ad3el,Loire55,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"Id be curious about how much he makes, in that case. 5% means he would be in the highest bracket, so at least 300K/year. Assuming he is did the math and is seeing not a five percent on the little bit over 300K, as someone who is making close to that mark would, but something closer to 5% of his whole income, that  indicates that 300K constitutes a minority of his income. I don't think there are very many albertans in that range, so your story, while plausible, seems irrelevant in that is does not apply to the vast majority of albertans."
alberta,3ad3el,Oplexus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:44:52 2015 UTC,Of course it doesn't apply to the vast majority of Albertans. The tax increase of designed specifically for the top 10%. I didn't claim it was relevant to the majority of Albertans.

So the tuition costs have more or less doubled since I have started my program, but as the market modifier portion isn't actually considered tuition, we aren't eligible for student loans to cover that portion, our student loan only take into account the core tuition costs.

E.g., AskScience.  The difference in behaviour vs opinion is that you can have a dissenting opinion and still contribute meaningful discourse, you can't be incendiary, antagonistic, rude and expect a conversation to be useful.

A comparitive example would be me walking into a church and screaming that the devil is awesome.  The church has every right to remove me because its understood beforehand that that type is not allowed in that place and at that time.    This is fundamentally different than an open question being asked and someone giving an answer the mods don't like, so as a subjective action they boot him or whatever.

alberta,3aa2g2,meredithgillis,3,Thu Jun 18 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Look - you arent in the minority in saying hes a pain in the butt, but free speech is free speech.  He has every right to use it just like you do, even if its stuff we dont like.    The voting system buries his comments to oblivion anyway."
alberta,3aa2g2,44years,-1,Thu Jun 18 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Free speech is all about government censorship. As a non-governmental entity, we have free reign to limit speech in any way we see fit. I believe eliminating the sort of discussions (vitriolic arguments) that TexasNorth causes is good for the subreddit. Again, nothing to do with his opinions, just his behavior."
alberta,3aa2g2,bawbzilla,3,Thu Jun 18 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"I'm getting technical here, but I just want to point out that even if free speech as a right began as being a way to avoid government censorship or if it's the government's responsibility to protect it when someone else tries to censor you (which I don't think it is, though given the current climate at the federal government regarding Access to Information Requests from reporters, I think it's fair to say in Canada government censorship is certainly one of the big opponents right now.)  In Canada, there is no absolute right to freedom of speech.   The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees    (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;   as part of section 2, the fundamental freedoms of all citizens.   But section 1 of the charter says   The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.   So if it can be demonstrably justified that censoring /u/TexasNorth is good for the subreddit, why not?  I don't think it'll help the situation. I think viewing speech which is distasteful or offensive as worthy of censorship when it doesn't contain anything factually wrong and isn't actively promoting violence against a person or group of people is wrong. Not a reasonable limit in my view. (This is not to be considered in any way an endorsement of his views. I'm not generally a fan of him, but I'm a big fan of free speech.)  But yeah, all the rights and freedoms in the charter can be subject to limits. It's a big difference between our constitution and the U.S. which a lot of people don't consider in conversation about free speech. Yes, Reddit is based in the U.S., but this is a Canadian sub."
alberta,3aa2g2,44years,-2,Fri Jun 19 19:10:40 2015 UTC,Free speech is all about government censorship.   I cant believe you actually typed this  Thats it im outta here

alberta,3aa2g2,44years,0,Thu Jun 18 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"yeah - what he means is the next sentence in the same post:     As a non-governmental entity, we have free reign to limit speech in any way we see fit.   He forgets that its government that can grants free speech by way of protecting it.  Saying something objectionable is one thing, but knowing you wont be attacked for saying it is another.  If the government (and the USA is literally the only one on the planet) says you have free speech then the people in said country can say whatever we want.  If he wants to suggest that groups of us will go around limiting the free speech thats granted by the government than its the governments responsibility to protect that speech by removing the threat posed by the party trying to limit it."
alberta,3aa2g2,bawbzilla,4,Thu Jun 18 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"Freedom of speech is an issue within government and meatspace, it just doesn't apply to private websites like reddit or other forums.  The ""I can't believe you actually typed this"" was a low move based on a misunderstanding of either of those points, or you were just being pedantic and interpreting it in a terrible way."
alberta,3aa2g2,vaguelyswami,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:48:51 2015 UTC,"not at all.  While you are right that reddit is a corporation and therefore in control of the content, its the fact that said content used to be open and free that made reddit what it is today.  Notice how many people are leaving reddit specifically because of the destruction of free speech on reddit.  I spend very little time here anymore because of it as well.  If reddit wants to back up your argument (the website mods decide if what you post should be made public) instead of mine (basically that free speech is fundamental to a healthy internet) then thats reddits choice.  It will eventually just become another Digg if it does though."

How is that ""not at all"" then? Reddit doesn't have to abide by anything regarding freedom of speech and never has. It's a private entity, a website, and freedom of speech is an issue for meatspace and the government, not nerds yelling at each other online. This isn't a discussion about what is good and healthy for an online community and it didn't start as one either."

alberta,3aa2g2,meredithgillis,13,Thu Jun 18 13:04:55 2015 UTC,"This isn't about ""free speech."" Talking about free speech and you are some crusader of that ""right"" has nothing to do with this subreddit. What is being discussed is actually community. What kind of community do you want to create on /r/alberta.  Those people who say ""well, he doesn't bother me"" or ""I think he's funny"" are a subgroup of people. But there is also a subgroup of people who refuse to post in forums where users can freely call people names. Yes, there is the argument they should grow a thick skin, or it's only words. That doesn't really matter. Understand that there are people that will simply not post and leave because of that.   If the community is fine with that, then that will continue to be the type of posting and discussion that occurs in this forum. It will largely be dominated by people that are overly aggressive (on both ends of the scale) and those who are tolerant of that aggressiveness. That tends to provide only one viewpoint in discussions (or one type of discussion). If the community is fine with that, then that is what the subreddit will be (or largely what it has become already).  There is a social etiquette that naturally forms, and the etiquette is the same whether it is a digital community or a community that people are physically a part of. These communities develop. A church, a country bar, a strip club, a school all have social norms that are acceptable and not acceptable. Most of that is regulated. Whether it's by authority figures, or it is something that you have grown to know due to society. No one screams ""free speech"" if some parent is talking about sucking cock on the sidewalk near an elementary school. Someone is going to tell them to shut the fuck up and will stop that person from continuing that discussion.  Geolocation subreddits are difficult, because the only thing tying people here is because they happen to live close to one another. So there is a WIDE variety of opinions. But be very aware that /u/texasnorth and others like him stop a significant number of people from participating in this subreddit. Now there will be a significant number of people who will call these people pansies, or pussies, and they should grow a set. But those people won't. They simply will leave. And they have left. And you end up with the community you have created.  It's not about free speech. And he does stimulate conversation. But only for a select group of people. So the question is actually what type of community you want to be a part of. If you're fine living in a community where assholes smear shit on the walls, then fine. Participate in an unmoderated forum where people call each other faggots and retards."
alberta,3aa2g2,bawbzilla,6,Fri Jun 19 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"Anyone understanding this as people wanting to ban a person because of unpopular opinions needs to read this post. Very well written. What sort of community we aim for is important, and a bad atmosphere can be wholly off-putting for participation."

alberta,3aa2g2,MorgothEatsUrBabies,2,Fri Jun 19 19:12:47 2015 UTC,"Censorship: ""We don't like your opinion and are going to stifle it."" Not censorship: ""You're a twat and can't interact with others like an adult, go away.""  TexasNorth is valuable as a person with differing opinions from the majority. They're completely worthless based on how they convey those opinions and interact with the community. They can believe anything they want, but if they can't get it across without calling someone a retard, they should be given notice."
alberta,3aa2g2,bawbzilla,6,Sat Jun 20 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, society gets to choose how individuals convey their message. Which is something that seems to be a difficult concept for you to grab onto. Each community gets to decide, as a whole, whether to be offended or not by the way someone talks and addresses other people. As a group, if enough people are offended by someone, they get to kick them out, remove them or silence them. This is not about your beliefs - this is about how you choose to carry yourself. And the way you carry yourself has repercussions.   You, as a group, are just as bad as the SJW. You expect everyone to be tolerant of how disrespectful you are. Understand that some people are intolerant of your bullshit.   Yes, amongst your close group of friends you may swear and call each other names. I would like to see you call my mother a name in front of my father and expect no repercussions. At work, what is the language you use? If someone has an opposing view of you in a University setting, or at the Thanksgiving table at a friend's grandmother's house, what language do you use? And how do you address them and their beliefs?  And it's not even that they are offended. If there is a community that swears, calls each other commies, or rednecks or addresses the individual themselves (i.e. insults them) instead of their opinion. Or plays the strawman. Or all the stupid things that seems to be the common occurrence. here, I just don't want to be a part of it. It's not that I'm offended. It's just not a community I want to participate or associate myself with. And there are lots of people like that. They simply don't want to be a part of it. You think that's awesome. I think you're the dipshit for wanting to drive those people away.  The best thing about Reddit, is you can create a community, provide guidelines, and have moderators create whatever community you want to have. I completely agree that within reason (child pornography, doxxing, etc), those who run Reddit should allow people to create whatever subreddit they want. I'm glad spacedicks exists. I just don't want to be a part of it. I'm glad there is a christian subreddit as well. Again, I don't want to participate in it. But I would be respectful of the community that was created.   The question here is, what kind of community should Alberta be? Personally, I want a community that is friendly towards civilized discussion. That you can convey a message without being attacked. I want a community that my sister, my kid, or someone new to the province could come to, post, and not be personally attacked. That the language and the way people conduct themselves is inviting, and conveys something for all ages. I would like it to better symbolize what I hope Alberta is... something that isn't racist or intolerant of people's beliefs. And a place that is welcoming of people of all ages.  I have no problem with people's opinions. I have a problem with the way people think it's perfectly fine to be bullies and assholes on this subreddit. And think that somehow, that's free speech.  If you do not have the capacity to speak intelligently without attacking someone or swearing, then fuck off. Or keep this subreddit the way it is, and I'll fuck off. And never suggest for anyone that I know to participate in it, because it has become toxic, thanks to assholes like you."

alberta,3aa2g2,bawbzilla,2,Sat Jun 20 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"You're assuming a lot of things, here, I feel that's a really bad way to get into this conversation. Why do you think those things about me?  Someone who can't convey their opinion without calling me a retard or socialist scum doesn't hurt my feelings, it makes me not take them seriously and not want to even bother. They're the internet equivalent to the crazy person yelling about the bible on a streetcorner, why bother?   Such expectations of behavior isn't unusual in a variety of subreddits, and they're absolutely all the better for it. Discussion goes way further and doesn't devolve into personal attacks and calling into question individuals intelligence, sexuality, or experience.  I don't expect my feelings to be protected. In fact, I hope they aren't, I want critical and mature discussion to put me on my ass and make me second guess everything I take for granted. What I don't want, is someone who specifically cannot engage with others in a mature and responsible way. What they say is fine, how they say it isn't, because I want this community to grow and some users are weeds."
alberta,3aa2g2,vaguelyswami,3,Sun Jun 21 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"You're still assuming a lot of things here, I really don't understand why. Why make a statement like ""you are unable to see the message past the delivery"" instead of asking something like my opinion of the importance of delivery versus message? This is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. You can't discuss this with me without assumptions and an insult like I lack empathy. You can do better than that.  I absolutely can understand their message, but who wants to get into a conversation with someone who can't speak with respect or maturity? This isn't about ""growing a pair"" or ""developing empathy"", it's about being a grown-ass adult and not talking like an edgy teenager. It's about how we can cultivate community and engage people, not be an exclusive club where only people who can deal with the poorly-behaved weirdo who scuttles out now and then to piss on people's legs and bite them are welcome.  You're dipping into disrespectful territory yourself by continually assuming a variety of things about me. I feel there's no point continuing this conversation, as I'm not talking with you or your ideas, I'm arguing against a strawman you've constructed of me in your mind."

Up until now we've removed a few comments and threads here and there, that might be from reports or just obvious spam. Other than /u/Karthan and myself, the other mods don't use or moderate this sub whatsoever (the previous action by another mod was May 4th, and that was when /u/aelon took mine and Karthan's mod privs, then gave them back the next day).   /u/jhra had posted asking for additional moderator volunteers, but I haven't seen anything since that time (guessing he's busy).   Here are my thoughts on /r/Alberta   I would like to see /u/aelon and /u/_CapR_ removed as moderators (they don't do anything, /u/_CapR_ doesn't even show up in the moderation log as far as it goes back) The theme changed to /r/naut.

I think the only time a ban is justified is when someone goes into straight-up criminal-charges territory with threats of bodily harm or death threats, or doxing someone so that real-life harm comes to that person. TexasNorth is a jerk, but as far as I know he's never threatened to harm anyone in real life, and has never doxed anyone. The worst he's done is swear at people."

alberta,3a8642,TweetPoster,0,Thu Jun 18 00:00:32 2015 UTC,"I hope they implement a PST. Sales taxes are the least volatile tax out there, and have the least negative economic impact. We would be better off with lower income taxes, and higher sales taxes."
alberta,3a8642,J__rad,6,Thu Jun 18 12:38:44 2015 UTC,"The reason they don't want to implement a sales tax is because it's a regressive tax that disproportionately affects the poor, which IMO pretty shitty."
alberta,3a8642,xrendan,-2,Thu Jun 18 13:15:48 2015 UTC,You can implement a progressive sales tax just the same as you can implement a progressive income tax.
alberta,3a8642,J__rad,4,Thu Jun 18 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"No you can't, at least not without serious cost, inconvenience or privacy violations, pick two."
alberta,3a8642,xrendan,-1,Thu Jun 18 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? What utter banality you are spewing. You institute progressive sales taxes by providing a return based on income, and omitting staples from taxation.  The real issue with a sales tax isn't a  regressive nature, it is the omission of capital gains."
alberta,3a8642,J__rad,0,Thu Jun 18 15:26:23 2015 UTC,Anyone who voted in the NDP should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. I look forward to visiting with you all in 4 years to say Told You So. Idiots.
alberta,3a8642,TexasNorth,-5,Mon Jun 22 01:17:22 2015 UTC,I don't fucking get it.   Is he implying that he wants a PST?    Conservatives in this province are never going to get anywhere with this retard at the helm.
alberta,3a8642,xrendan,3,Thu Jun 18 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"No, QP is where private member's pose questions about government policy to cabinet. He was brainstorming what to ask Notley not what he wants to implement."

alberta,3a5m6u,IcarusOnReddit,3,Wed Jun 17 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"I bought a house for half that, since it's all I thought I could afford responsibly. So that meant buying an older fixer upper. Now I spend $1k/mo or so on maintenance on top of all the other bills (and there is literally no insulation in the walls, so imagine the bills in winter). Between that and all the deductions at work, my $100k gross turns into $56k net, and subtract about $3k/mo for housing expenses and I have about $20k to live on. Not bad for a single guy. But a car payment including insurance and fuel takes up another $10-$12k of that. Bam, not very difficult to have nothing left over at the end of the month."

I'll concede that 125k a year might still put you in the middle class but thats the very upper edge of middle class. And if you don't have ASSLOADS of liquid money in the bank while making that kind of money you need to take a good hard look at how you waste your money."

alberta,3a5y4e,elktamer,13,Wed Jun 17 15:54:10 2015 UTC,I kind of find your comparison kind of disingenuous.   The NDP is full of bright people just like the PC party was and they will adapt to their new role as quickly as any new government in transition. I realize Alberta hasn't done this in 30 years but  governments continue to function even when new people are in power.
alberta,3a5y4e,KelMage,-1,Wed Jun 17 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"they will adapt to their new role as quickly as any new government in transition.   They're a government that didn't expect to be in power, and didn't prepare for it, taking over for a party that had 44 years of experience in a completely unique economy. Do you really think they'll adapt as quickly as any other government would?"
alberta,3a5y4e,elktamer,9,Wed Jun 17 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"Sure, because they have competent staff and a national-level party that will aid them as well. This is what happens in other provinces, it can happen in Alberta too without the sky falling.

alberta,3a5y4e,pedal2000,0,Thu Jun 18 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Right, which of those three are dealing with the issues of land locked oil transport, infrastructure cost increases from worker migration, mitigating the expenses of oil sands extraction, and diversifying industry in a market where oil and gas drives up the cost of labour.   Or do you not think those are the main challenges facing the government?"
alberta,3a5y4e,elktamer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"Land locked resource transports - Sask.  Infrastructure cost increases from worker migration - GB, Sask.  Mitigating the expenses of resource extraction - Norway, Sask.  Diversifying Industry in a market where resource extraction drives up cost of labour? - Norway, Sask.  Oil isn't a unique resource... it doesn't have properties which make it inherently different from a Government policy prospective from most other resources."
alberta,3a5y4e,pedal2000,0,Thu Jun 18 16:17:07 2015 UTC,The fact that every single one of those is wrong proves my point.   Saskatchewan has about 1/5th the production of Alberta and at best has to worry about piggy backing on choices made here. Great Britain is certainly not facing an increase in infrastructure costs because oil workers are migrating there. Is that actually what you meant?
alberta,3a5y4e,elktamer,-1,Thu Jun 18 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"So we can only vote PC because only the PCs have experience, right?   How did Lougheed manage in 1971? His party only had 6 MLAs before they won."

alberta,3a5y4e,SAM-000,0,Fri Jun 26 03:00:11 2015 UTC,They have a huge challenge ahead of them.  The conservatives ran the province into the ground by ensuring the middle and lower class had almost no money to spend in this economy.    Despite just taking over the NDP is going to get blamed for any job loss even though the wheels were probably already in motion regardless of who got voted in.    They might be inexperienced but unlike the conservatives they do have the peoples best interest in mind instead of their donors.

Unless you achieve permanent residence.  Alberta has a condition to exclude TFW who's four years would be up this year.  Visas are handled federally so there is no difference between provinces

Premier Paul Davis said Tuesday his province would announce a new royalty regime in the next few weeks to help speed up offshore development.  The new regime will be more streamlined and agile, similar to those that succeeded in Norway and other offshore sectors, the premier said as he opened an oil and gas conference. It will also clarify international expectations and accelerate negotiations, he said.""  So I am confused.

For example, the utopia for an oil company is somewhere that it can extract the oil, keep all the profits, and in turn, never have to contribute to the welfare of the people in the region it is located in the form of redistribution (taxes). Alberta wasn't a utopia, but the PC government made sure taxes here were low enough that it would keep the oil flowing.  Now, the NDP is coming at this situation with the mindset of, ""If your going to exploit our natural resources, your gonna have to contribute more back to our society."" Of course, if your an oil patch worker, this will piss you off from a logistical standpoint because your job may be at risk; many oil patch workers cant afford to think ideologically when their paycheck is on the line.  The doom and gloom heard about how we should leave Alberta's royalty regime alone comes from the big oil execs and from people who have based their livelihood on the oil patch. Obviously, oil companies have much to lose from higher taxes. Also, many Albertan's have lived their entire lives thinking this is an oil province, and are incapable of imagining Alberta having anything else.  However, this is just a simplified version of the debate, and there are many more nuances to the situation than what I have stated."

When I arrived in Alberta back in 2003, oil was booming but farming was still very important.  The BSE incident was huge news and there were often reports on how the weather was impacting farming across the province.    Then something changed and oil became the only thing that mattered.  Maybe it was when the bottom fell out of the market in 2008 or maybe it was the intervening few years as house prices shot up.  Either way, ""Alberta = oil"" has been the mantra for years and it has had a huge impact on provincial politics."

I also know that Norway will have a strong economy much longer than Alberta. They have a trillion dollars in reserves to keep their economy afloat through diversification and targeted growth. We have nothing.   I'm not a hypocrite. I advocate for higher taxes knowing full well that I will end up being in the bracket that pays more than all others.

Alberta still has some of the best deals in the world in terms of royalties.

The NDP had 3 mill in donations but only 1 mill of that was from unions. (all made up numbers obv)  Now next election rather than the PCs being up on $$ the NDP are, and though they have less overall to spend all that really matters is the relative amount.

Any union that tried this would be ignored/ridiculed, short of the Teamsters and other blue collar unions where arm size is the main criteria. Even then, expect to be voted out at the next Union general meeting.  b-Far worse/common on the part of corporations. Employers HAVE systematically bullied their employees to ""donate"" again and again. Entire firms ""donating"" the maximum legally allowed. Union can only, in your fantasy world, shame you. Your employer can make your life a living hell, find any pretence to fire you, cut your position due to ""lack of work"" etc.. The balance of power is far more in the favour of your employer than your union.  Long story short, donation limits are a GOOD idea. A better idea would be to ban ALL donations and provide a ""per vote"" subsidy. The only issue being how does a new party/candidate start out. I haven't seen a good solution for the later."

Besides, the statement actually fingers out only the top 10% of earners in Alberta which are those making upwards of 300K which will be expected to pay more. I'm sorry to those making 300K or more (which is actually most of my family and I'll be there too soon enough) if you can't pay a little more to help the people in the bottom 40% who are making less that a sixth of what you're making you're running too tight to the margin anyway. Or you're a greedy fucker and I don't have time for you anyway; and before you ask, yes, I have said that to some of my family members."

alberta,39zemh,KelMage,5,Tue Jun 16 07:40:35 2015 UTC,"Sure it is, taxes are the cost we pay for the benefit of living in a civilized society that provides services to everyone. When you declare that you are unwilling to pay more taxes when the alternative is gutting of social services to the people that desperately need them, that is greed. If you are able to live comfortably while others scramble to make ends meet and you refuse to share, it's greed. When you're unwilling to share in the cost to educate the next generation properly, it's greed.   Civil society, and taxes, exist in part to stave off the natural inclination of a human to care only that they have what they need to the detriment of everyone else."

Those provinces are struggling due to a lack of massive amounts of high-price natural resources, not because of unreasonably high taxes. Take a look at New Brunswick, my old home province; 4% small business rate, 12% normal rate. That's only 1% and 2% higher than Alberta under the old rates, respectively. Yet New Brunswick's economy is a complete disaster.  Nova Scotia has decent reserves of natural gas, but prices have been low for years and show no sign of rising. PEI basically only has agriculture and tourism. The one east coast bright spot is Newfoundland, but - guess what - they also have oil."

PEI has an S&P credit rating of A, which is worse than 48 U.S. States. New Brunswick has a credit rating of AA-, which is worse than the AA or higher rating of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

Design and construction do indeed provide high paying jobs, by their very temporal nature they are jobs that are highly volatile and vulnerable.   I believe this low oil price cycle has to play out over the next few years [just like the previous three cycles] and there is nothing to be done about it. Wages and design/material costs will come down and our competitiveness in the world markets will go up as we adjust to this new low oil price environment. Its how its done.  Calling it a crisis seems to infer that all the great minds within the oil and gas industry were caught flatfooted and ill prepared [having never experienced a large commodity price drop before]. Which is bullshit in my mind. They know the business better than anyone else. They've experience this before.

(unless it's your job that was just cut)   My primary point of agreement with the article is that Notley's policies are certainly making the situation worse rather than better. Project economics in this sector accommodate variability in the commodity price. Increases to corporate tax are just one more adjustment to the model, but adding in the cost of risks associated with royalty costs (rate TBD), potential climate change regulations (scope, costs and potential production impacts TBD), market access limitations (support pipeline approvals TBD) and the number of projects crossing the return hurdle rate drops by a significant level. Which will, absolutely, result in lost jobs.   BTW - I don't see most of the comments about the negative impact of the legislative uncertainty coming individual companies. Individual companies are free to move their capital to other jurisdictions and while it would be easier for them to stay in Alberta, they have no obligation to do so. Whether they hire a rig pig in northern AB or in south dakota makes no difference to their investors. The negative comments are coming from those who have a vested interest in Alberta keeping jobs."

alberta,39w7is,Morgsz,4,Mon Jun 15 20:59:19 2015 UTC,They will avoid billions in spending.  Billions in spending on things like Social Assistance and ASH. Companies will benefit from reduce payroll burden for everything from EI to health benefits and every single person will benefit from what amounts to much lower taxes.    The right should be the ones most happy about this as it makes total economic sense. Unfortunately they are blinded by pure ideology and because of that really can't be said to stand for fiscal responsibility any longer.
alberta,39w7is,pseud0nym,-10,Mon Jun 15 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"The NDP don't plan on deficit spending billions more than the Conservatives, and we're all going to have much lower taxes.  How fucking high are you right now, exactly?"
alberta,39w7is,pseud0nym,2,Mon Jun 15 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"Apparently you didn't bother to read the budget that the NDP released in the election which ballanced it 1 year after the Conservatives.    And yes, mincome means we will all have much lower taxes. As I said: ideologically blind due to bigotry. Conservatives can no longer be said to stand for fiscal responsibility as they reject anything their pernicious ideology tells them to regardless of if it makes fiscal sense or not.  You seem to forget, this province went decades handing out monthly cheques to the population. A fund that had billions in it before the conservatives took over and spent it all in less than 6 months."

Also as a staunch Libertarian, I have to inform you that you live on a cloud 9 dream world if you think that 'mincome' will result in lower taxes, or that if the Alberta PROGRESSIVE Conservative party is/are anything other than the 'conservative' wing of the NDP/Liberal party.  If you want to debate actual 'conservative' policies, than you should try to actually debate real fiscal conservative policies - not liberal tax and spend policies held by non-conservatives in a party that is non-conservative, but has the word ""Conservative"" in its name.  :/"

Ideologically blinded due to bigotry.    ""Movement"" Conservatives, such as yourself, are not for fiscal responsibility.  They are for ideology first and foremost and damn the consequences on the country. They will drive Alberta and Canada into the ground if their ideology tells them to (just look at Kanas to see what the far right has planned. Even after massive and obvious failure they STILL want to do more damage because of ideology). The further right you go, the worse it becomes.

I can redefine murder so that murders are really just ""upset delivers unto god's justice"" but they are still murderers.    The far right's attempt to redefine the meaning of words is rather humorous I must admit. Shows they actually know exactly how disgusting their ideology actually is and what it represents.    The far right has been responsible for more deaths than anyone else. Of course, you have redefined history as well so that black is white and white is black. You aren't fooling anyone but yourselves.     Do you even understand where the word Libertarian originates?     More than you do.  I also recognize the take over from the extreme right that happened in the early 2000s. Libertarian now means far right, gun nut, psyhco that likes to shot cops and kill kids when they don't get their way. They are the FBI's number one terrorist threat and have staged more terrorist attacks on North America than anyone else.    I am well aware of what Libertarianism is now, what it was and where it came from. There was a time, before the extremists took over, I also would have identified as a Libertarian.

You have a CHOICE.  If enough people chose not to buy the sawdust flour from the company selling it, that company would go out of business.    This is what normal people call ""the invisible hand of the free market"", and ""personal choice.""

If you say Alberta owns all the oil and therefore deserves royalties, so it's not technically a tax - it doesn't matter. It still acts as a business disincentive.  Now it could very well be that the disincentive is minor compared with the benefits of doing business, so oil companies continue to operate at normal levels, and the province does in fact just get more revenue.  I'm just saying that it's not as simple as ""we'll just legislate more money out of oil companies/other businesses"". There is a balance point."

alberta,39w7is,Ex_Officio15,-2,Mon Jun 15 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, mincome is cheaper. If you just give everyone money, you don't have to have a huge, unwieldy, and massively expensive bureaucracy to figure out who should and should not get it. You don't need programs like ASH and other social services because everyone already has a minimum income. The reality is that mincome makes fiscal sense and the people who REALLY should be supporting it are conservatives. Unfortunately they are too ideologically blinded by bigotry to support fiscal responsibility.   The conservative experiment in Alberta has been a disaster and a lesson in the consequences of selling the future for a little current prosperity."
alberta,39w7is,electricsandstorm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"The amount of money we spend on welfare programs like ASH is quite tiny. Mincome may work, but in order for it to make any impact, it would be massively expensive."
alberta,39w7is,Ex_Officio15,5,Mon Jun 15 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"Not just ASH, but also Income Support as well. Don't forget, you don't just lose the direct spending, but all the salaries of the administrators, the buildings to house them, the overhead on those buildings and the staff that provides oversight.  There is the IT support systems and much much more that is now no longer necessary. The only part you keep is the anti-fraud department and that can be much smaller as they are only looking for people collecting obvious fraud like collecting for people who are dead or made up.  The savings are massive and continue from year to year to year. Never mind the reality that people will be able to improve their lives, make a larger salary and increase the tax base.    By what metric do you think it would be ""massively expensive""? Considering that the people who have looked at this from extremely conservatives viewpoints also agree that it makes fiscal sense, what qualifications do you have to contradict them? Do you have any studies to show that it will be? I have the ones showing that it isn't.   So, let's see it.  Why do you, unlike both right and left wing economists, know it will be so expensive? What information do you have that scholars all over the world are missing?"
alberta,39w7is,electricsandstorm,-12,Mon Jun 15 20:20:04 2015 UTC,"Uh, spending only what you have isn't being 'austere', it's common sense.    You leftists have twisted the word 'austerity' into something that it doesn't mean.  It doesn't mean that you live within your means, it means that you make cuts that are so drastic and so severe that it begins to effect other things, or that you stop spending all together.  REGRESSIVE liberals take austerity to mean that we're 'only' going to deficit spend by ~$6 billion dollars + this year, where they think we should be deficit spending by $15 or $50 billion."

alberta,39w7is,AngryInYYc,0,Mon Jun 15 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree.   35% of the 45 you quoted is the federal government though. The NDP aren't raising provincial personal tax. Corporations only pay 10% right now which is fine, but as the part owners of public resources I think we both deserve a little more for letting corporations use them.  I am not clear on how anything discussed in the article relates to personal taxes, 45% is more than plenty, now that the recession they needed it for is over and we are mostly finished with makework projects I would like to see federal taxes go down. I know this is unrelated to the article, but you raised an interesting point, that Keynesian economics are supposed to work both ways and the federal PCs aren't really holding up their end of the 2008 bargain.  What I do wonder, is what you think about bringing personal and corporate taxes closer together. I agree completely that personal tax is high, and could/maybe should be less. Personal taxes total (let's say for easy math) 45%. Corporate taxes total 25%. Why shouldn't my personal taxes by 40% and my companies taxes be 30% (probably not how the math works out, this is a thought experiment not an actual financial analysis)?  Sure I am going to have less profit out of my business, but my operating costs aren't affected by that and of anything more money in my customer's pockets is a good thing for me. If I have a GP of 100k a year, 25% to 30% is only 5k and isn't putting my business in the poor house, and having happier employees probably works well from an efficiency standpoint.  I am genuinely curious what you think about that TN. I know we have diverged entirely from the point of the article, but would you accept a higher corporate rate if your personal rate went down?"

alberta,39u76f,Brett686,2,Mon Jun 15 05:49:28 2015 UTC,Hydraulic fracturing is fracing no matter which way you look at it. Be it for completions to get more production out of a well or in a disposal injection well. Main differences are volumes of frac fluids/gasses and pressures. Generally fracking in a completion sense uses alot more fluids at higher pressures.

alberta,39rfwx,stfurtfm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I mean buying cryovac primals, so for example a ribeye is essentially just a steak cut from a prime rib.

You can cut a rib into a roast and 10 2"" thick steaks, vacuum seal them and freeze them. Do it twice and you pay for the vacuum sealer with the savings.  Same applies to almost any kind of meat: the bigger the hunk, the cheaper the price per kilo.  You can find tutorials on basic fabrication (thats what secondary butchery is called: Meat packers or cutters break down whole animals into primal, butchers and cooks take the process from there...)"

Now my question is do you want the min wage to be equil or worse then the Asian laundrymat workers in the 1890s who got. 35c per day and lived in a Barraks.   Because thats what 10$ per day is today.. yes it does buy more but thats because Everything has gotten cheaper in real terms. Not because the wage has actually went up.   15$/h is a fair wage that reflects the actual lowering of costs of quality of life for a low wage worker.   And i did not vote NDP.
alberta,39q1r2,Himser,7,Sat Jun 13 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"Now my question is do you want the min wage to be equil or worse then the Asian laundrymat workers in the 1890s who got. 35c per day and lived in a Barraks.   What does this have to do with anything, this job doesn't exist any more and doesn't have relevance to today's economy/world. But yes, that is how inflation works.  Proof on $15 being a fair wage? I've seen several figures on what a proper living wage constitutes but it seems to me that $15 is a round number that's easily politically conveyable. I haven't seen any real research of $15 being the actual number."
alberta,39q1r2,Hayves,-1,Sun Jun 14 04:44:56 2015 UTC,I never said it was the most fair wage. Just better then the 10 it is now. Maybe the fairest wage is 11. Maybe its 21. Maybe its a Mincome or a BI vs a hourly wage. I dont know. What i do know is that the barely surviving wages of $0.35 in 1890 is pretty close to $9.08(http://www.westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi) today.. that is unacceptable for people to be that close to indenture servitude today. At least $15.00 is 30% better then that wage.

alberta,39q1r2,mobilemoron,0,Sun Jun 28 15:37:33 2015 UTC,You don't understand the concept of inflation... 0.35/day is = to 9.08/h. It's the same amount of money.

I work in a grocery store, as soon as minimum wage goes up.. so will the price of food, will I really see a benefit in the long run?  I dunno.  Anyone could live on a lower wage if they wanted to, but most people want ""things"" and "" more things"" and ""nicer things"". When minimum wage goes up, and prices go up, the ones who will hurt the most are those on fixed incomes, which will probably go up too but not by much."
alberta,39q1r2,Himser,9,Sat Jun 13 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"If you go into buisness you find out things like yes wages will go up which costs X.. however the cost of each product is X+Y. So if min wage increases the X portion of the product cost increases however the Y costs (electricity, rent, cost of Product) stay the same.   So say we had a complete 30% increase in wages across the board. (everyone) things like Meat with high labour costs may jump 20%. Things like Fruit which is not produced here may only jump 5%. Overall good for Albertains and those who make the new min wage (people like you who run on lower wages).   Where something like that hurts is the export marker, so things like Tourism and Hotels. (yes even tho they are here they are an export) and any other export.   Now other then Hotels and Tourism there is not a lot of Min Wage work in export orientated businesses. Whereas Retail there is a lot of Min wage work. And a increased min wage will not affect the retail sector in a negative way at all.   Basically a increased min wage to Alberta (to a limit) is a net benefit to our economy and society. Some businesses (hospitality) will be hurt but most will benefit from increased market potential within Alberta."

alberta,39q1r2,Himser,3,Sat Jun 13 22:48:27 2015 UTC,Why do we assume rent/water/power/Internet everything stay the same?
alberta,39q1r2,SexualPredat0r,0,Sun Jun 14 17:22:02 2015 UTC,I would assume some price increases. However at the very basic level labour is never 100% of the product price thus labour rate increases are never translated 100% into product price increases.   Rent/water/power etc are all non labour and more capital intesive products and should feel less variation as labour price changes.
alberta,39q1r2,Anabiotic,3,Sun Jun 14 18:09:36 2015 UTC,There are still people working at those places for that delivery the utilities. I think they would go up just like anything else. Rent could be an exception.
alberta,39q1r2,SexualPredat0r,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Most of these places don't have many employees near minimum wage, so the effect would be pretty small. Somebody making $35 an hour isn't going to get an increase because the minimum wage went up."
alberta,39q1r2,Anabiotic,2,Sun Jun 14 23:36:43 2015 UTC,So if that's the case wouldn't the person who is middle class (making $20-$35 an hour) be negatively effected by the increase?
alberta,39q1r2,SexualPredat0r,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:02:45 2015 UTC,Obviously some group will have to absorb  the increase. If all wages inflated we'd be pretty well back to where we started.

They obviously wont be cutting staff so they have no choice but to raise their rates aka inflation. I imagine other industries that rely on minimum wage people will either raise their prices or cut jobs. All the countries on the planet that brag about high minimum wage what they don't tell you is no one can afford to eat out as much as they do here.

I think that you and your employer should sit down and evaluate your skill set, work ethic and determination and come to an agreed upon price for your labour, be it $5/hour, or $15/hour, or $5000/hour.  If the price that your employer would like to pay you is less than you feel you're worth, guess what!  You don't have to fucking work there!

We had no internet, no cable television...  no electronics, but she went to school after having a good breakfast at home and took sandwiches for lunch.  When she was young I got her clothes from the second hand store, or some where made by my mom.  By the time she was 14 she got her own job.    The government gives low income people money for their kids every month, so its not really as tough as people think, but if a person has 2-3 kids then cries about them being expensive.. well I guess they should have realized that after one kid.. right?  Oh and we did buy her Canada Savings Bonds too."

The 'poor' people will have gone out and bought a pair of Nike's or a tattoo, and the ""rich 1%"" will have gone out and turned that $100 into $105, or $150.    'Poor' people are 'poor' because they suck at life, and it doesn't matter how many NDP politicians you elect, or how many 'free things' they promise to give to you, the government cannot take people who have a permanent poverty mindset and magically force them to become middle class.

He was interim director and had to put is name on the registry for regulatory reasons. Sure, he was directing an anti-Northern Gateway environmentalist organization for a few months, but it's a lie to say he was actively lobbying the government.  Why Mitchell's appointment will certainly be criticized by conservative politicians and supporters and it will piss off people who listen to Ezra Levant and boycott Tim Hortons', I really doubt the oil industry, which overall seems to have had a good relationship with the bew government, is going to get antagonistic with Notley over who becomes staffers in her government. For example, CAPP's Presendent, when asked about this, said they focus on elected officials, not staffers and bureaucrats, and have had a good relationship with Notley and McQuaig-Boyd: http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/wildrose-charges-ndp-energy-ministers-top-staffer-was-anti-pipeline-lobbyist  Staffers are usually young, partisan, and very passionate and more ideological than their elected bosses.

Now oil gets a not-so-supportive (although, I seriously doubt their fear mongering) minister, and there's hand-waving everywhere: ""The sky is falling.""  Deal with it: oil will run out eventually, so we might as well join much of the rest of the world and start thinking about alternatives."
alberta,39m7jp,goingfullretard-orig,-1,Sat Jun 13 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"But it’s also a reflection of the fact that the sector is still mourning the death of its 40-plus year relationship – and relationships – with the previous government. It had gotten used to having an open line to the Premier’s office and knowing that the province’s interests were usually theirs writ large.   Poor oil industry... No longer able to have direct privileged access to the premier, and having the entire government bend to its will.  Let's all mourn the death of corporatocricy."

Voting for the NDP isn't enough- you also need to buy into what they are about (which, in our system, isn't necessarily a given just because you voted for them). You need to be known by someone higher up in the NDP so that they actually can trust you. And you need to be invested enough in provincial politics to leave your current job behind.  Finding dozens of people like that is a very tall order for a party that, a few months ago, no one thought would form government."

What about having someone who is pro renewables rather than anti everything oil/gas? What about someone with some experience in the power industry?   Or someone with a senior position with a landowners group who has experience working with the oil and gas companies? Someone who manages an environmental consulting firm and is familiar with our current regulatory regime from that side?  As a hiring manager, I believe ""thinks like me"" is about the worst hiring criteria anyone could use as their primary evaluation criteria. Sure, you want someone who'll toe the line to the Minister's direction, but you want someone who's bringing some skills or knowledge to the table which complements what minister has already, which I'm not seeing in this case."

It's literally his responsibility, because I'm paying more than just the tip to be there and be served properly.   If I complain and he washes his hands of it and says ""Keep the 15% of the meal which would have gone to the server"" it tells me that he's not interested in resolving any issues, because he doesn't think it's his fault (it partly is), and he doesn't have to face any consequences for having a shitty business.  Plus, maybe as a customer I decide that the shitty service isn't the server's fault. What then?

alberta,39g3pa,kakarrot87,9,Thu Jun 11 19:09:50 2015 UTC,So the bosses of some of the people who most need it want an exception. Shocking.
alberta,39g3pa,kakarrot87,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would consider servers as most needing it. If anything, I think paying them a minimum livable wage might decrease the net pay of a typical server as they see tipping disappear. It will certainly decrease the net pay of many. Servers can make very good cash for unskilled work."
alberta,39g3pa,Ufgt,2,Thu Jun 11 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think tipping will disappear, but I do think that many people will feel less obligated to tip for mediocre or bad service. If anything, I think servers might have to give better service to earn the same tips."
alberta,39g3pa,kakarrot87,12,Thu Jun 11 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck that. I've worked in the industry all my fucking life. I see guys struggling in life, people first arriving to the country who can only work as a dishwasher or salad cook.   Sure the servers make money in tips and they'll do better with the increased minimum wage. But who really needs it are the backbones of the restaurant. If my dishwasher made 15 bucks an hour maybe he could afford some new shoes and have some confidence in himself. Maybe it wouldn't be the least favourable job in the kitchen. Maybe he could get his own place. Maybe he wouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck. And maybe, just maybe most of us in the kitchen wouldn't have to work 2 fucking jobs just to be able to save for a house, car, or trip somewhere."
alberta,39g3pa,Dirkef88,4,Thu Jun 11 21:59:33 2015 UTC,You're going to start arguements with waiters that think they have it harder than the guy scrubbing half eaten meals in the steamroom at the back.  I'll never understand it but most really dont think they should be splitting their tips with the people in the back.
alberta,39g3pa,SurlyMoose,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"Good! I'll defend the kitchen always.   But it is tough for sure. To give both back and front of the house those wages...  Restaurants, small business will crumble. Only solution is to Jack up pricess and lower number of staff. My 36 dollar fillet will be 46. Nobody will buy it so I won't need as much staff to serve it.   That and servers need to increase their tip out percentage to the kitchen/bar/house. Huehuehue."

And yes, serving is the most stressful and difficult.   If the kitchen is getting slammed and is super busy, that means the service staff are also getting slammed. The major difference is that servers have to remain smiling and pleasant the whole time. And when a customer gets angry, it's the servers that have to stand there and take it with a smile and an apology.  I gladly share tips with the kitchen staff, often tipping out more than required. But the only reason I'd rather serve than work in the kitchen is because of the tips. If we all made the same wage and there was no tipping, no way would I choose to serve over cooking."

alberta,39g3pa,Dataeater,2,Thu Jun 11 22:55:38 2015 UTC,And currently the servers are the ones who suffer when the restaurant is slow. The owners should be the ones who suffer if they can't bring in the customers.

alberta,39g3pa,theoreoman,4,Thu Jun 11 23:32:22 2015 UTC,"So will the social custom of tipping go away? All the servers I know make way more than minimum wage because of tips. Plus a lot of it is untaxed because there is no paper trail. And thats fine by me, I tip well when the service is good and I tip low or not all when the service is bad. They earn according to how good they are but if their legislated minimum is the same as everyone else, I really dont see why they would be any more deserving of tips than anyone else who provides any kind of service."

alberta,39fs1i,Windig0,15,Thu Jun 11 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"Public speaking is a job requirement of a politician. Not something that should be learned ""on the job"". And it's one thing for a young, inexperienced back-bencher to need to improve their public speaking, but it's another issue entirely when the most important cabinet member can't get through a 5 minute fluff speech.  All this shows is a complete lack of professionalism and one can infer a complete lack of understanding of the industry. This does very little to inspire confidence in investors, particularly in a time when investment is already largely put on hold. Saying nothing, while not the best option obviously, would still have been the better option here."
alberta,39fs1i,g_gundy,4,Thu Jun 11 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"All this shows is a complete lack of professionalism and one can infer a complete lack of understanding of the industry.   I was with you up till there.  Public speaking is a very important aspect of the job and the speech was very poorly done.  That being said, it doesn't show a lack of proffessionalism and it certainly doesn't infer ""a complete lack of understanding"". The speech wasn't excellent by any means, but it was far from unproffessional. Furthermore, there is absolutely no correlation between understanding the industry and public speaking skills. To imply as such is to say that anyone who is an excellent public speaker is de facto qualified in their subject material."
alberta,39fs1i,bluntoclock,5,Thu Jun 11 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"How was that not unprofessional? She stared at the paper throughout the entire speech and read it through like she was reading it the first time- clearly it was not something she wrote herself. That comes across to me as completely unprepared which (in my opinion anyway) is very unprofessional in a job where one of your primary duties is to give speeches.  As for my inference, it's my own again opinion obviously, but someone who does a terrible job at something that should be their bread and butter doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the rest of their abilities.     Like it or not, she's now a spokesperson for Alberta in the investment community. Don't know about you, but if I heard a speech like that from a company I was investing in, I'd be selling shares before they stumbled their way to the 3rd paragraph.   To imply as such is to say that anyone who is an excellent public speaker is de facto qualified in their subject material.    No it's not, that's just a basic job requirement. But at the very least it shows you've put some effort and commitment into your job."

alberta,39fs1i,ApoliticalypseNow,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're lying to yourself. In many jobs, I agree that it's irrelevant, but not in a position where a primary function of your job IS to make speeches. It doesn't matter if the technical expert on the subject can deliver a speech, but it matter HUGELY if the CEO or PR/sales rep can't- and that's the equivalent position from the private sector.  Look at why Apple was so successful under Steve Jobs. Good product design was part of it, but the vast majority of their success came from marketing and Steve's ability to inspire confidence.  Do you think Steve knew the intimate details of how the iPhone worked? Of course not- but he sure as hell knew how to present it and how to make high level decisions that benefited the company."

Also, you just blew on past my point that she'll get better.   A Minister's job is not to PR and Hype [speeches] IMO, its to make sound policy decisions. You want hype and PR over sound policy decisions? Likely not. In the perfect world we get leaders that are both sound decision makers and good PR types.

""Let's all vote for the party that we know the least about, and that we don't even really trust, but we'll all 'cross our fingers' and hope and pray that they don't screw it up too badly.""  You're about to fucking see just how well the 'cross our fingers' strategy is about to work out.  You COULD HAVE voted for a party that you know full well would have been better for the economy, but instead you chose to put your own best interests ahead of everything else and vote for the complete unknown.

Which makes sense: the government shouldn't give you a bigger write off than someone who chooses to live closer to their office. It shouldn't subsidize long commutes. But it is impossible to make a metric about ""we will subsidize x length of commute. So nobody's commute gets to be written off.  If, after getting to the office, you drive somewhere else your employer may reimburse you for mileage. They can't reimburse your mileage for getting to the office. If they do give you money for mileage above and beyond your commute, this reimbursement isn't taxed. If they don't reimburse you, you can write off this mileage on your personal taxes.  Now, let's say that Bob is given a company car. Bob is allowed to use it to get to/from his office each day and for personal benefit on the company's dime. This is a taxable benefit. He has to pay tax on this ""free"" mileage. Bob's tax burden is the same as yours.  True, ""the business itself"" doesn't have to pay tax on the mileage that it gives to Bob. But it is inane to compare the business itself to you. It is just a legal entity. What is important is that the person benefiting from the business, Bob, has the same tax burden as you do.  It is also true that there are people who don't count the personal use as a taxable benefit. But they are breaking the law. I personally know several people who have been dinged by CRA for this."

Liberals see a pie that never grows or shrinks, and only remains entirely static, and they think that the only thing they can do is take ever increasing slices of that static pie to pay for government (via higher tax rates).  Economic conservatives see a pie that nearly constantly growing, and never remains static.  They see that if they can take a smaller percentage of a larger pie, that not only do they get the amount of money that they need to fund the government, but that there is more pie left over for everyone else to divide.  It's been proven time and time again that increasing taxes stifles the economy and PREVENTS economic growth.  It's also been proven time and time again that decreasing tax rates HELPS the economy grow, and as the economy grows, there is actually MORE revenue collected from newly created streams.

alberta,39dhjw,catnip-ca,17,Thu Jun 11 06:26:22 2015 UTC,"There is an optimal rate of taxes. It's more of a bell curve over a down=good, up=bad. Look up the ""laffer curve"".  For example: The more taxes are reduced, the worse the education system is, which is the real lifeblood to a long term economy. The worse the health care system is, so people who are hurt don't work longer. The less of a chance the homeless get out of their rut and into jobs again. The crappier the roads and infrastructure get, causing delays for businesses shipping their components. All these hurt the economy. Do these outweigh the harm to the private sector? sometimes yes, sometimes no.  It is really hard to tell what is optimal, but read what has happened in Kansas and California. A massive lowering of the tax rates in Kansas has done nothing for the economy, and has left the public system in ruins and the books in disarray. Their growth is below average of the states there. The tax increases in California has had no effect on their growth (though still only tepid), but their books are balanced and they can add back to the public system."
alberta,39dhjw,venuswasaflytrap,2,Thu Jun 11 08:26:09 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very good and important point for either side of the political spectrum.  In Canada the top 10% of earners cover more than 50% of the total tax revenue. The top 2% cover more than 25% of the total tax revenue.  You might think this is fair (I do), you might think it's unfair, but it doesn't really matter. Ultimately what it means is that policies that effect the rich and super rich aren't just going to effect 10%, or 2% of the country. They're also going to affect 50%, or 25% of our total tax revenue. Conversely the bottom 50% only contribute to 4% of the tax revenue.  On the other hand, as you point out, if you fuck over the bottom 50% (regardless of the obvious moral implications), even though they're only contributing 4% of the tax revenue - they can cost a ton of money in the form of healthcare, prisons, education, law enforcement etc. One way or another people need to be provided for. Either you pay early in the form of education, welfare and the like, or you pay (much) more later in the form of prisons, healthcare, law enforcement, etc.  It's a balancing act."
alberta,39dhjw,iwasnotarobot,6,Fri Jun 12 08:39:55 2015 UTC,"The question as presented is: Does increased tax rates slow overall economic growth?   It really depends on how the taxes are administered. If you tax the poor heavily, then yes, you have in fact killed your economic growth.   Poor and middle class members of the economy are the real economic engine of the economy. Lower income members of the economy tend to spend their earnings on necessities. It is this consumer base that drives demand, drives spending, and does the work. (Wealthy/corps will tell you differently, but they are spreading misinformation.)  The same is not true of progressive tax policies, which allow for low taxes on lower incomes, and increase taxes at higher incomes. When taxes on high income earners and corporations are low, the money is often not recirculated in the economy, but kept in savings accounts or held in limbo in the casino stock market. Because the money is not recirculated, the economy stagnates.  Normally it is the wealthy who are the champions of ""lower the taxes!"" policies.   If you'd like to learn more about the economy, I'll let you explore the link I cited in my prior comment regarding the film Inequality for All. Full doc here. Robert Reich does a better job explaining this than I can in a reddit comment."

Do you know what it was like here before the oil industry came along? We had nothing between 1914 (grain crash) and 1950 (Leduc No 1). Everything we currently have is thanks to the economic prosperity the oil industry has brought us.    It's not about some shitty companies about to get wasted and it's about whether the big companies decide to stay or not. If they go. Say goodbye to Alberta the prosperous. This isn't supposed to be a doomsday prophecy; we'll still have gas from the Peace region, there's some decent shale plays in the west, tourism to the mountains will always be there, but a large chunk of our prosperity goes with the oil sands.  And it'll be painful for all of us, including those not in any way connected to the oil industry.  Now that's a problem. Why is the oil industry pretty much the only driver of our economy? We have the PC's to thank for failing to diversify Alberta, but none the less, here we are and this is our reality.  Reading your posts you seem to think it's just some small players that will pack up. That's not at all the case. You also seem to think the oil industry needs us, or that oil sands are just like any other play. This is also not the case (I'm actually a geologist so I can go in depth on why the oil sands are such an expensive play if you'd like).  On the one hand, we all want Alberta to get her fair share. Who knows. If the barrel gets up to lofty heights again there's plenty of room for increased taxation and royalties.  On the other hand Alberta wouldn't be nearly as prosperous as she currently is without the oil industry. Goodbye to our metro systems, goodbye to our roads and infrastructure (which are some of the best in Canada outside of Edmonton), goodbye to our top of the world schools (that the PC's tried to wreck in the last 6 years), goodbye to our healthcare, goodbye new museums, theaters, arena's.  It's all a balancing act and it's not nearly as easy as you seem to think."
alberta,398sgv,TexasNorth,2,Wed Jun 10 12:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying its easy, but its also not exactly hard.  You are 100% correct though, it is entirely a balancing act.  We can't just crack the royalty rate to hell, especially during a downturn in the price of oil. But we have absolutely no idea what the plan is right now, but I'd wager good money that there isn't going to be some industry-destroying increase to tax or royalties.  There may be a small increase...there may be no change...there may be a decrease when oil is low and an increase when oil is high.    I agree fully that if there isn't a profit in it, companies won't develop.  We DO have to strike a balance here.  Yes, we have the oil, but they have the capital investment.  BUT - if we do strike that balance (and I have every faith we will) - there will likely still be issues in the oilsands until the price goes up - as you said, and I have no disagreement, it isn't cheap to extract oil in the oilsands.  But we might actually have to face that the oilsands are going to be in a major slump for a while if the price of oil doesn't recover soon.

alberta,398sgv,rippppin,2,Wed Jun 10 13:56:03 2015 UTC,"http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2014/07/giver-taker/   In a 2010 report prepared by EnviroEconomics for the IISD examining subsidy support in three provinces – Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador – Sawyer used the World Trade Organization’s definition of a subsidy. It’s one agreed to by 153 member countries including Canada. That definition identifies four types of subsidies: where government provides direct transfers of funds or liabilities, foregoes revenue, provides or purchases goods or services, or provides income or price support. EnviroEconomics estimated that provincial and federal governments were providing about $2.8 billion annually in subsidies to the oil sector in the three provinces. The federal government share of that is about $1.4 billion annually.  The study identified 63 different subsidy programs, 18 of which were in Alberta. Most are designed, reports EnviroEconomics, to increase exploration and development by reducing the costs of those activities through tax breaks and royalty reductions. But it doesn’t mention, for instance, the enormous financial commitments the province has made to the Sturgeon Refinery. The Wild Rose party has accused the province of giving the companies behind the project – Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and North West Upgrading Inc. –at least $1.3 billion in “corporate welfare.”   Facts, fucking TexasNorth in the ass since...well, forever."

alberta,394obd,MisterSnuggles,11,Wed Jun 10 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"According to the PCs, centralization is the way to go, so this is something that the PCs and NDP should see eye-to-eye on.  Of course, the PCs weren't able to see eye-to-eye with themselves, hence the planned decentralization.  Then again, according to this blog, the PC plan was just an internal reorganization anyway and not really decentralization.  Each time an organization gets restructured it's a shock to the system.  It takes time for the people who were moved around to understand the new processes and reporting structures.  Heck, it takes time for those new processes and structures to be developed in the first place.  In the last decade, it seems like every time people just got used to how things are they got reorganized and had to start all over again.  This kind of stuff has to stop.    Sure, maybe centralization isn't that great, but let's stop tearing this organization apart every few years and let it actually work on healing patients instead of constantly having to heal itself."
alberta,394obd,MisterSnuggles,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong as to the effects of decentralization on this, but a lot of that change and transition has occurred directly because of the government: Most recently Prentice's huge budget cuts.  Before that, Redford's massive pushing for FCCs over PCNs, and the PCNs themselves were pushed by the government originally (by Stelmach I believe, though I could be wrong there).     Medical professionals were getting frustrated that every new administration had a new way they were gonna change healthcare.  So it seems to me like decentralization wouldn't be a bad thing...  Then again, Klein was all about decentralization with his whole ""Third Way"" thing.  So I suppose decentralization and government involvement in the health care system aren't the same thing."

Saskatchewan has only one choice and has across the board cheaper rates and much cheaper rates for new drivers. Obviously the quest for profit increase the cost of things. Note that in this case Saskatchewan is maintaining a ""socialist"" policy because data supports it even though single provider auto insurance was set up by the NDP (technically CCF the precursor to the NDP).  You should not be blinded by ideology and advocate on policy based on data. The free market sometimes doesn't provide the most public good.  If I have a choice, but have much less money at the end of the day, hasn't a bad choice already been made for me?  For more info on comparisons between the public and private delivery of auto insurance: http://www.consumer.ca/uploads/general/2003_09_00_Review_Auto_Insurance_Rates_FINAL.pdf  It should be noted that insurance companies have set up blogs which do studies with flawed methodology to try to put private insurance into other provinces."

I'm commenting because I really think you should do more research on bear safety. If the intent of the bear bell is for safety/deterring bears, I would leave them at home. If this is where your research has lead you, you need to do a lot more. They aren't proven to be effective, your own noises (talking, singing, breaking twigs as you walk over them) will be much more effective at deterring. And carry bear spray with you as a last resort, find some YouTube videos on proper use, etc. BEFORE you go out. Understand the different behaviours you might see (aggressive or defensive, bluff charge) and how to act around different bears.  Www.Bearsmart.com is an excellent resource."

I read that talking and singing is an effective way to let the bears know you are there, but the silence and not having to speak the entire time is one of the reasons I want to go there, therefor I was thinking of a bell so I wouldn't have to speak the whole time.

alberta,395pqr,BiscottiBloke,3,Mon Jun 22 04:45:11 2015 UTC,"Hi! I used to be a guide in Waterton years ago, and I know the park like the back of my hand. I've seen dozens of bears over the years in different scenarios.  Overall, your best chance of seeing a bear in a safe manner is from your car driving up ""Red Rock Road"", or from a distance during a hike. There are no bad hikes in Waterton, all are gorgeous in different ways and in different lengths, and all have a chance to see wildlife.  The best hikes in Waterton are the following, although as I said all are great: 1) Crypt Lake   2) Carthew-Alderson   3) Rowe Lakes   4) Bear's Hump  A bit more about these. They are ordered in descending difficulty, 1 being moderate/high, and 4 being easy.  Crypt Lake is world-class, full-day hike. Many chances to see all forms of wildlife if you're lucky. You have to take a ferry across the lake, which you can read about here. Keep in mind Waterton is about 3 hours from Calgary, so factor that into your planning. The trail has a brief, tight tunnel section FYI, and you have to make sure you're back in time for the return boat!  Carthew-Alderson is amazing for mountain views. It is a full day, one direction. You can book a shuttle to take you to the trail head at the top, and the after a brief steep climb, the rest of the day is a gradual downhill.   Rowe lakes goes through nice meadows at the top, although the first half is through trees (still pretty). The trail head is on the Cameron Lake road, about 3/4 of the way up to Cameron Lake.   Bears Hump is very short but very steep, and offers a great view of the main valley. This is a busy trail, but very good payoff for a quarter day hike.   As always when hiking, bring a day pack with 2 litres of water per person (don't drink stream or lake water), snacks, lunch, and sunscreen.   Let me tell you, as much as you want to see a bear, you don't want to surprise one up close. As most people have said already, normal human noise is your best defense against surprising a bear. I like to have conversations, and if we're all quiet because we're out of breath, I'll shout out a loud WHOOP every 3 minutes or so. It might look weird, but better than nothing.  HERE is a map of the whole area, which you can also find at the visitor's centre. Please PM me if you have any specific questions, I actually miss my former job where I answered them all the time! I live in Edmonton now which is a long drive so I'm super jealous!"

alberta,395pqr,CamMakoJ,3,Mon Jun 22 04:46:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, with duckfishdeer, i do a fair amount of field work in bear territory, and by and far (im not an expert, but have had some experience) noise that you make is the best defense against surprising a bear and ending up in a 'tense' situation. It is always important to have a plan of action for if you come upon a bear and you should be able to attempt to 'read' its mood and reaction.  That being said, waterton is a beautiful area with a quaint town for exploring. I would say just go prepared, make noise, and have a plan for if you do see a bear"
alberta,395pqr,unjung,3,Tue Jun 9 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Take Highway 22 between Highway 1 and Waterton, not Highway 2.  Other than that, bear bells are useless. Just sing and talk loudly, and carry bear spray."
alberta,395pqr,bvlm,2,Tue Jun 9 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"The best places to view Wildlife from the road would be Highway 1A between Banff and Lake Louise, and Highway 93 between Lake Louise and Jasper.  Bear Safety:Parks Canada has a good website on this, but your best bet is to hike in groups, make regular noise (talk with your hiking partners), and watch out for prints, fresh scat, fresh diggings, or smells that may indicate a kill is nearby.  I don't think bear bells are that useful if you're hiking in a group, but that's my own personal opinion.  Hike Options:  Waterton: Alderson-Carthew, hands down. It's one way, so you'll need a ride to the trailhead.  Banff Wilcox Pass: technically in Jasper, but amazing views of the alpine and Columbia Icefields. Doable as a day hike from Banff.  C-Level cirque: nice hike close to Banff  Johnston Canyon Ink Pots: very crowded first half, but quiets down after the second waterfall  Edith and Cory Pass: near Banff, but a longer day.  Larch Valley: moraine lake area. Start early to get parking at the busy day use area.  Parker Ridge:short hike with glacial views north of lake Louise.  Just some personal favorites of mine. I would also check out kananaskis country for hikes."

This preemptive whining is getting real old, real fast.  Furthermore, If you're a skilled tradesperson sitting on your ass unemployed in Alberta right now, the NDP is not to blame. The more likely scenario is that You suck at your job, show up intoxicated, spend your time hiding from your foreman and fapping to phone porn, or can't be bothered to show up on time/at all. The good, honest, skilled workers in this province are having no problem finding and keeping work.

alberta,399o9f,Kaelteth,-9,Wed Jun 10 12:31:43 2015 UTC,"The NDP is not responsible for the oil price ""crash"", but THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE for the extremely high levels of uncertainty in the current market.  Let's say you want to buy a house, and you have all of your money saved up and you're all pre-approved for a mortgage, and than your boss says to you: ""Hey Kaelteth, we might either give you a raise, or cut your salary by 30% over the next few months, we're not sure at this point.  Also, we have no short-term plans for the future, and we don't plan on making any either.  We may still be in business, or we may not - we're not sure.""  Does Kaelteth, in all of his/her infinite wisdom, still go out and buy a house?  Probably not.  Probably not, because if you did, you would be irresponsible.    That's the problem right now.  Oil prices @$60/barrel aren't horrible - the problem is that we've decided to elect a know-nothing government full of leftist radicals and social justice warriors, and NOBODY knows what they're going to do, so EVERYONE plans for the worst case scenario.    Using your own words: ""Fuck these people (the NDP) are dumb."""
alberta,399o9f,TexasNorth,11,Wed Jun 10 14:29:21 2015 UTC,"How can you seriously look at the current climate in Oil & Gas and decide that the NDP is to blame for the uncertainty?  We're such a small blip on the map to the Saudi's that we're not part of their global strategy, our losing market share is just a handy side-effect for them.    Sure CNRL has come out and said ""hey we're not sure what the government is doing so we're going to wait before we say what we're doing"" but that's not fear-mongering it's just common sense.  And across the board the industry has reported that they like the level of dialogue that they have had with the new government.    I think we should all just stop freaking out and maybe wait and see what actually happens.  Maybe you'll be right /u/TexasNorth and then you can come and rub it in our faces.  Or hopefully you'll be dead wrong and a royalty review will be mutually beneficial to the industry and the province.  But until then we all sound like the analysts who decide what oil price is going to be in 3 months/6 months.  One of them is going to be right but it's going to be blind luck to determine who that is."

But oil in the shitter is a bigger driver of the lack of investment right now than uncertainty.  And it's easy to see for those with a fucking braincell in their heads, because investment and development in the oil industry is down EVERYWHERE right now, not just in Alberta with the horrible THE SKY IS FALLING government.  You and I agree on one thing in this:  The NDP has the power to completely fuck up the oil industry.  What your little conservative brain is incapable of understanding is that nobody is stupid enough to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  The NDP are not going to destroy the oil industry in Alberta.  Industry is playing a game right now...""Give us everything we want or we go home"".  Once we see that the sky is not in fact falling, and the price of oil recovers, then the oil industry in Alberta will be back to normal."
alberta,399o9f,Kaelteth,2,Wed Jun 10 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Also, there's far too much money to be made off Albertan resources for big biz to walk away. They'll frighten and threaten and whine and complain, but they'll come back and agree to terms at some point.   ...assuming that OPEC doesn't completely destroy the oil industry of any locale that produces at a higher cost than they do with this not-so-little-anymore stunt."

I know a couple guys that within their first year or so were essentially making a buck a minute on Sundays at age 19.  Their friends working at Starbucks in Calgary were lucky to be making 11 bucks an hour.   Also when it's busy all it takes is a few years of taking whatever call up you get, being clean and safe and words like ""driller"" get tossed your way with potential pay in the hundreds of thousands per year.

Of course OPEC and the price of oil over the past year are the true culprit, but it's fascinating that these people are already scapegoating the NDP despite them being in office for such a short time."
alberta,399o9f,WillieConway,4,Wed Jun 10 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"Another curious phenomenon from a sociological or psychological perspective would be the need that so many who work in the oil patch have to justify it by some high moral ground. I can't count how many times I've seen pro-oil industry posts in which workers praise themselves for their hard work and sacrifice and deride critics of the oil industry as hypocrites, cowards, etc.  It's almost as though they see themselves as soldiers fighting the good fight. There seems to be a need for many workers to pretend that oil is their calling and any attack on, say, the enormous air and water pollution caused by the tar oil sands is like an attack on their church. They seem to forget that a lot of them fell into the job because it's not hard to get and pays really well."

Notley and her nefarious gang of provincial mla's finally wrestled power from all the OPEC national oil companies, as well as the oil juniors like Exxon Mobil and BP and drove the world price of oil down. She also invested billions out of her chequing account to drive the price of renewables lower and make fracking in the US cheaper. People, she did all this on a Monday! Took a long lunch and went home early. I also heard that her ex-boyfriend in high school was Russian so she wanted to punish him and his countrymen for ditching her at the school dance.

That is the beginnings of the Wildrose as we know it - a group of people determined to protect oil earnings.

When socialist governments fail, money is wasted. When right wing governments fail, futures are wasted by the crumbling state of education and infrastructure. I think a gamble with money is better than a gamble with futures. I will take a government that wastes money with good intentions over one that wastes it only to benefit corporate greed.

My fear is that she won't do this and instead will act like a ""moderate"" up until the federal election and help to get that idiot Mulclair elected to either a large minority, or even majority government.

Hope of what?  Hope that the government can fix all of the problems that government has exacerbated?  These people don't know what a ""progressive"" is, and they sure as fuck don't know what they stand for, other than ""change"" from what we have now.  Barack Obama said that he wanted to ""fundamentally transform"" the US if he was elected, and guess what?  The US is now ""fundamentally transformed"", just not for the better.    Notley is exactly the same.  She also wants ""fundamental transformation"" of Alberta.  It's impossible to lift everyone else up, so her 'grand plan' is to knock us down a few pegs so that things are more 'equal' across the country.

Alberta's history is far more tied up with government establishing the rule of law over what was originally a lawless corporate oligarchy (see Northwest Company, liquor trade, Fort Whoop-Up, establishment of the NWMP, et al.)

alberta,38xci5,AntonBanton,3,Mon Jun 8 01:33:42 2015 UTC,Give people the option to opt out instead...   You can. It's called spoiling the ballot. They're counted and reported just like any vote.
alberta,38xci5,Ashlir,3,Mon Jun 8 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Actually it's declining your ballot you want to do. That shows that you didn't want to vote or vote for any of the people on the ballot.  Spoiled ballots are counted separately from the declined ballots. High numbers of spoiled ballots can be interpreted as people not being able to figure out how to fill their ballots out, declined ballots are presumably people who rejected all the candidates."
alberta,38xci5,Brett686,2,Mon Jun 8 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"What's the difference? How do you ""decline"" rather than spoiling your ballot?"
alberta,38xci5,Facticity,4,Mon Jun 8 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"I explained the difference in my post, and they're counted as two different categories.   To decline your ballot you inform the clerk that would normally be handing you the ballot that you're declining it and they record it as declined. The total spoiled ballot count also includes ballots that are returned to the deputy returning officer and exchanged for a new ballot (usually because the person realized they screwed up). The only way to know for sure that a person actually intended for their vote to not be counted is to decline it."

alberta,38zutm,ZanThrax,7,Mon Jun 8 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"The best explanation I've seen of the process is from the Poll Supervisor's Manual   Declined Ballots and Protest Votes  In some provinces [Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta], an elector may cast a protest vote by taking advantage of a process referred to as declining a ballot.   If an elector wishes to register a protest against the candidates listed on the ballot, the regular voting procedure must be followed. If the elector refuses to go behind the voting screen, he must return the ballot to the deputy returning officer without marking it.  The deputy returning officer asks the poll clerk to cross off the elector’s name on the list of electors and to place a checkmark in the “Voted” column beside the elector’s name.   Note: This ballot must be dropped into the ballot box. In accordance with the Canada Elections Act, the ballot is treated as a “rejected” ballot at the count.   The process was implemented as a response to Edible Ballot Society who were encouraging people to eat their ballots as a protest vote in 2000."

If we have a true living wage, I think we should at least halve the tip for good service, and stop tipping for merely normal service.

She worked lots of night shifts ($2hr premium), and picked up lots of fill-in spots on her unit when people would call in sick etc, and she made more than $100k/yr. Again, she worked long hours.  If she would have only worked 8hr shifts she would have made at least $60k/yr.  A server making $15/hr that works 42hrs a week and 52 weeks a year (that means no holidays at all) would make $32,760 before tax on their hourly wage alone. That is NOT a lot of money considering the amount of time and effort put in. Serving is a hard job, if they're good and the food is good, you should tip."

It's an issue of self-control, of which Albertan politicians tend to have none.  It always seems to be ""oh we need more infrastructure"" or ""oh the schools are failing"" or ""oh the healthcare system is under-funded.""  If this province had a trillion dollar savings fund, I fucking PROMISE YOU that we would spend $1.1 trillion on pet projects and buying votes.    Canadians (and Albertans) have some of the highest debt to income levels in the developed world, and it's no wonder why we can't balance a damn budget or save anything.  Macro or micro, the ONLY way that you can actually save money is by NOT SPENDING more than you have.    You people can not prove for a single damn second that you actually care about debt and deficits, and NOT enslaving the children of this province with future interest payments with your ""buy now - pay later"" sense of entitlement; and for that reason alone is exactly why we don't have a trillion dollar savings account.

Remember those idiot politicians that set up the Heritage Fund to do a combination of saving money, as well as providing money into research and social services. They even had the gall to provide seed money to start-up companies. What a HUGE waste. Then they started putting money into funding research into technologies that are obviously going nowhere.  Do you remember Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority. Took money from the Heritage Fund and pissed it away on technology related to oil deposits that will never be commercially viable. SAGD... more like SHITD, am I right there Texas?  Or a scholarship set up for valedictorians and those getting high grade in high school? Communist, Socialist Marxism if I've ever seen it. Let those kids pull themselves up by their bootstraps and take out student loans. Those poor struggling PROPER capitalist banks need all the help they can get.

Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, Alberta Children's Provincial General Hospital (Calgary), Walter C. Mackenzie Health Services Centre (Edmonton), University of Alberta Clinical Research Building,  Alberta Family Life and Substance Abuse Foundation. Hippie organizations that have given NOTHING back to Alberta.   My god, the late 70s and the early 80s were a dark time in Alberta's history. Give me the good ol' mid nineties back.

alberta,38lmzs,autowikibot,2,Fri Jun 5 15:43:25 2015 UTC,"Despite what you hardcore libertarians believe, there IS such a thing as good debt.  When the cost of borrowing and repaying the money is lower than the inflationary cost of the project in delaying it to the future once it has been saved up for, you have ""good debt"" - so long of course as you are not exceeding your ability to make the repayment schedule.  So, lets say with the current economic downturn a road would cost $1,000,000 to build.  Once industry returns to normal, that same road would cost $1,250,000.  If the interest payments on the $1,000,000 over the life of the loan is less than $250,000, then it is in our best interest to borrow now and repay as we go.  Now granted, that's for capital spending.  Operational spending is an entirely different ball game.

alberta,38lsii,DownShatCreek,3,Sat Jun 6 05:33:36 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on this.  I agree that there should be open data around elections and results, and that the Elections website should be redesigned.  The website is a mess and the lack of historical data is disappointing.  However, I disagree with the premise that these will encourage significantly more people to vote.    An updated elections website might help encourage some people to vote, but I think that is only a tiny part of the puzzle.  Elections Alberta sends cards to every household showing where and when to vote, including advance polls, so virtually everyone should be able to figure out where they need to go and when to go there.  A better website will help some people, but not enough to significantly boost the turnout.  Likewise, I don't think that open data will directly result in an increased turnout either, though this could feed into the Get Out The Vote activities that the parties and other interested groups do. The parties and political activists are the main beneficiaries of the open data, it would be up to those people to take the data and run with it.  This is honestly something we should have anyway, regardless of whether it increases turnout.  The other activities (online voting, more polling stations, education) that he argues for in his opening statement would likely have much more impact than a new website and open data.  In all honesty though, I really don't understand why the turnout is so low.  Between the advance polls, the election day polls, the cards mailed out to every household telling people exactly where and when to vote, and the laws that ensure that everyone has three hours on election day to go vote, I don't see how we could make it any easier.  Voting is honestly not that difficult or inconvenient."

They can afford to keep the price low for as long as they want.  Saudi Arabia is in the driver's seat unfortunately.

That represents thousands of researchers around the globe. Denying that obesity is a chronic illness is like saying that Cancer is a choice. If people would just stop going out in the sun, they would not get skin cancer. This level of ignorance when it comes to obesity is beyond me. We are way behind in our understanding of obesity compared to other illnesses such as mental illness."
alberta,38jajg,Kaelteth,13,Thu Jun 4 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"people would just stop going out in the sun   Except we warn people all the time to avoid too much exposure to the sun and we often shame those who tan too much and put themselves at risk.   The idea that the choice to eat a bunch of unhealthy food and live sedentary life is incomparable to smoking is absurd. The only difference that really exists is that there's a trend to be be sympathetic and apologetic of unhealthy obesity because certain people have chosen to make obesity into it's own perverse form of 'identity', while on the other hand smoking has been shamed to hell and back.  There's a reason why countries like Japan with no societal excuse making for obesity are able to stay so much more healthy in that regard."
alberta,38jajg,Kaelteth,5,Thu Jun 4 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"Is obesity an illness, or a manifestation of an illness? To me, saying obesity is an illness is like saying laziness is an illness. Or bad hygiene is an illness. I honestly don't mean to insult, I'm actually looking for a better understanding.  There are definite factors that may lead to obesity. And some of those are disease-related (for example, the oft-quoted thyroid gland). Some may be related to mental illness. Some may be genetically linked (""Prader-Willi Syndrome or even some characteristics of Down Syndrome can result in a manifestation of obesity, for extreme examples).  I've always thought of obesity as a symptom that may indicate that there is an illness. It's easy to say ""exercise more... eat less"" in the same way it's easy to tell someone who's depressed to ""just be happy"" or ""go out and make some friends.""  But I don't think it's beneficial to call obesity an illness that is chronic. That sounds like you need to take care of the obesity. That doesn't appear to be the case. The case seems to be that you need to control diet and exercise. You may need to address the mental or physical components that are resulting in the lack of control of diet and lack of exercise. In the same way that someone being lethargic (lazy) or not taking care of themselves (poor hygiene) may be indicative of a mental or physical illness.  If that makes sense."

There are over 200 factors with over 300 interactions that play a role in our influencing our energy in and our energy out.
alberta,38jajg,Obesity_Stigma,10,Thu Jun 4 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"Good try.  Yep, there are 200 factors and 300 interactions, but very few influence the energy in-energy out in any physiological way.  The rest are behavioral or mental based.  You could plop smoking in the middle instead of obesity, and have the same interactions.  Doesn't make it a disease.  Look, I get it.  Losing weight isn't easy, and compares almost exactly to the success rate of quitting smoking.  No denial it is hard to do.  No denial that it takes an enormous amount of will to succeed.  No denial that we shouldn't treat overweight people as human beings, and not be dicks towards them.  Still not a disease."
alberta,38jajg,DavidHydePierce,-3,Thu Jun 4 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"If you can plop smoking in to this map...it follows that if smoking is an addiction and addictions are considered a disease that deserve evidence based prevention and treatments, then why is obesity not a disease?  The answer is that society views obesity as a self-inflicted condition that is simple and easy to control by just having willpower. Why provide evidence based treatments to people who did this to themselves.   Denying all the causes of obesity is not helpful. Framing obesity as a disease will help us find more evidence based solutions. Rather than just telling people to eat less and move more. Eating too much and moving too little are symptoms of something else. We need to address the root causes of obesity not just use band aid solutions that are ineffective and stigmatizing.  To me, calling obesity a disease, gets people to understand that we need to address the root causes of weight gain.   Telling people to eat less and move more is as absurd as telling someone with depression to just smile and be happy. It is useless."

Obesity is a self-inflicted addiction that has various physiological and social causes and impacts.  To me, calling either a disease ignores the fact that there is a self-inflicted aspect in each case.  I was a smoker, which was caused by a number of outside pressures and my own lack of will.  I smoked for damn near 20 years, which was caused by my addiction.  I quit, and it was the hardest thing I've ever done because of my addiction, but through hard work and effort and force of will I got past it.  My wife has obesity issues, caused by outside pressures and stressors, and intensified through 3 pregnancies.  My wife was obese for damn near 18 years, when she made a choice that her addiction to living a sedentary lifestyle and eating shitty foods was no longer acceptable, and is currently in the process of changing this unhealthy aspect of her life through hard work and dedication."

That same 5%, give or take, is the success rate for smokers to quit on any given attempt.  Smoking is not a disease, it is an addiction.  We understand that a person's physiology can increase or decrease the likelihood of the addiction, and how it manifests.  Stress and other triggers can, and does, cause people to return to their addiction.  Obesity is an addiction.  Yes, individual physiology can impact the degree of the addiction affecting an individual, but the reality is if you exercise and consume fewer calories, or even better calories, then weight loss happens.  Stress, and other factors, can cause a person to return to their addiction.  Obesity is a disease just lets people ignore what they are doing to themselves, and tries to make them feel good about their poor choices.  I agree fully that these people need to be helped and supported in dealing with their addiction - being assholes to them won't help them - but enough fucking bullshit excuses too."

The behaviours such as diet and exercise or smoking are influenced by a variety of factors including individual control. But individual control is not the only factors that influence those behaviours. There are many internal (physiological) and external (environmental) factors that influence diet, exercise or smoking."

A huge benefit of the original Heritage Fund was the interest that was created. It's not that ALL the money is saved for perpetuity. Some of the money can (and should) be spent. And it can be spend over generations in ways that all Albertans benefit.  Some are social programs. The Heritage Fund continues to provide money to the Rutherford Scholarship. It has also provided money into medical research. Which has allowed Alberta which, for example, has been a part of having Alberta be one of the leaders in diabetes research.  But what many people seem to forget is that the research that developed many advancements in oil sands extraction and heavy crude oil extraction was funded by the Heritage Fund.   Money invested in research creates new industry or advancements in existing industry that can benefit the entire province. And we have proof. Right here in Alberta. And it is tough for an individual or industry to be willing to spend the money that benefits everyone, as the incentive is to only spend money that can make them (and them alone) money, and typically only in the short-term.

Research, education scholarships, enhancement of parks. The PC party laid the proper foundation. It was brilliant. It provided the model of the Norwegian fund. And it was largely abandoned in 1987 as that was the year the transfer of natural resource royalty revenues to the Fund were stopped.  What's kind of incredible is that in spite of that, it still sits at $17 billion and still contributes a lot to Alberta. Almost in spite of themselves, the PC party was still able to have billions of dollars saved.   What I find most hilarious though, in a sad sort of way, is that the reason much of the oil sands development and technology that has been the backbone of the Alberta economy was funded by the Heritage Fund - just in case anyone wanted to understand how resource money can actually result in more money being brought in.

I think this one makes it more complex and thus more likely to be judged negatively with the other gender classifications they allow in.  I walked into their shop a few weeks ago and honestly was not overly impressed with what they were doing on a day to day basis.  I had no idea what I was supposed to do, had no idea who actually worked there and never actually found someone to speak to around the questions I had (looking for a used bike).  I decided that the whole concept was probably not my cup of tea and it would just be easier for me to buy my own tools, work in my garage and get all my training off YouTube."

It's volunteer run, and they were very busy that night (a great sin if the value of the service they provide).  I find it a little intimidating even as a fairly handy guy with limited knowledge of bike work (though I've learned a lot on my own). I can see how it would be even worse for women surrounded by bike savvy men (even though they are very nice).  FWIW I've only been to the place twice, but fully support what they are doing. This is a waste of the human rights time. As a Caucasian male, I don't think there is anything wrong with facing an ""injustice"" every 5 years or so - it might offer a bit of perspective of how the rest of the world lives."

alberta,38h8qw,NumeroDeux,2,Mon Jun 8 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"How is this any different than female only gyms? Or female only classes in gyms?   In a couple of ways:   ""female only"" is based on including one identity category; ""female, trans* and non-binary"" is based on excluding one category (i.e., men). In my other posts I already outlined the poorly theorized concept of what ""men"" is on the group's website. How many gym classes do you know that cater to ""women, trans, and non-binary sexualities""?  It's a false analogy to compare the bike shop and a gym. In the case of a gym, there are issues of clothing and vulnerable bodily positions that provide more legitimacy to the notion of discomfort=harm. In the bicycle shop, the customers comport themselves the same as customers in any other bike shop.   To turn the question around: how are the customers here different from customers in any other bike store? Or, because you think the volunteer issue is somehow important (for reasons that are not clear, by the way), how are the customers at this volunteer-operate bike events different from the customers at other volunteer-operated events?"

So they're offering a few days a month for people who normally feel excluded to come in without having to worry about harassment. All they're asking is for people to have some empathy for a couple days a month. If the people who take part in these events went to the news every single time they felt excluded from a particular place, that's all there would be in the news.   http://edmontonbikes.ca/services/bikeworks/women-transgender-program/"
alberta,38h8qw,Dabookitty,6,Thu Jun 4 05:28:53 2015 UTC,"And that harassment sucks. It really does, but again, these events seem to be countering bigotry with bigotry. Granted, context is important and, say, a white cis-male making derogatory comments to a transgender person is not as bad as the other way around. And yet, it's still, as I said, subscribing to some version of ""two wrongs make a right."" It's still discrimination, in other words.  And also, ""felt excluded"" and actually were excluded are two very different things that should not be collapsed."
alberta,38h8qw,Dabookitty,-3,Thu Jun 4 05:33:46 2015 UTC,Bigotry requires intolerance to a group of people. They weren't intolerant to him and did not exclude him on the basis of hate. They were having a event for the purpose of creating a safe space.
alberta,38h8qw,powderjunkie11,8,Thu Jun 4 05:54:52 2015 UTC,"In that case, what do you think ""intolerance"" means? It seems clear enough they were not willing to tolerate his presence based on this being a member of the group men, which is why he wasn't allowed in.  As for hate--that's never been a necessary condition of bigotry. After all, the classic bigot says things like, ""Look, some of my best friends are [_____________], but. . ."" There is no clear hate in those obviously bigoted comments.  As for this ""safe space""--what does ""safe"" mean? Does it mean simply ""not feeling uncomfortable""? If so, that's a pretty crappy standard to try apply with any consistency. If it means a place in which harassment and other crimes will not be allowed, then it's banal--we should expect that standard from all public venues.   The problem with saying ""no men because we want to feel safe"" is that it effectively says ""all men are dangerous,"" and that kind of characterizing is naked bigotry."
alberta,38h8qw,TexasNorth,-2,Thu Jun 4 06:01:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Incorrect word choice on my part, in regards to intolerance and bigotry. There's always a certain level of implication when you're talking about social intolerance that it's intolerance or bigotry against a marginalized group, and that's what I was thinking of when I mentioned it. However, I want to point out that they didn't deny him entrance because they have a problem with him being a man, but because the event was specifically a safe space for women, trans* and non-binary individuals.  Safe space is a term. You can't really separate it like that. It's also called autonomous space in sociological study if the issue is with that particular word. The intent of a safe/autonomous space is to create an area that is free from the possibility of harassment for marginalized people. It is created for marginalized people. It's intent is not to harm or keep certain people out, but to make the people within the group feel like they can express themselves without the possibility that they will experience harassment. What you're talking about in your comment is called discriminatory segregation. That's when a dominant group creates a group for the expressed purpose of harming another group (like the KKK, etc).  That's literally not what it says it all. It does not say no men. It says yes women, trans*, and binary. It's not a treehouse with a sign that says ""no boys allowed"" nor is it even close to making the claim that all men are dangerous. They're not doing it with the aim at harming men, they just want an area to go for a little bit where the possibility of harassment is not going to come up. It's a very temporary group that focuses on a certain amount of people for a small time.  Edit: Just wanted to add a couple quotes from the site before I head off to bed.   ""Q: Isn't separating a group of people based on race, gender, class, etc. called segregation, which is a bad thing?  A: BikeWorks does not exist in a social vacuum. On any given day, the shop is often dominated by males, and volunteers and patrons of all genders carry with them social norms beyond our control. These norms often include expectations that males tend to be stronger cyclists or mechanics. Our Women, Trans & Gender Non-Binary program provides a safer space which explicitly moves away from those expectations.  The existence of these societal norms means that traditionally male-dominated spaces such as bike shops tend to segregate, to the benefit of men, without any conscious intent. Our Women, Trans & Gender Non-Binary program is a conscious recognition of this, and an organized effort at countering the problems it creates, with the goal of shifting BikeWorks so that no gender dominates on any day.  Q: Isn't restricting access to BikeWorks based on gender a violation of human rights?  A: No.  From the Alberta Human Rights Commission:  Community organizations can provide services only to men or women if those individuals have been unable to participate fully in society based on their gender, and would not otherwise have access to the services. For example, a recreation organization may set up an exercise program only for women to address the lack of such activities in the community.  It is worth noting that BikeWorks isn't restricting access to men: as a volunteer-run organization, we program our two facilities 7 days a week. One of those programs includes our Women, Trans & Gender Non-Binary program, which exists because of dedicated women, trans & gender non-binary volunteers who have stepped up to run this program on a day when we would otherwise be closed. Thanks in part to the new volunteers from the Women, Trans & Gender Non-Binary program, we have been able to expand our hours across the week at both of our locations.  In the average month, we have about 200 hours of programmed time at BikeWorks. Our Women, Trans & Gender Non-Binary program composes only about 4% of that time.""

alberta,38h8qw,Kaelteth,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:43:09 2015 UTC,"I understand the defence you are mounting, but I don't buy it for a few reasons. First, I'm not really sure the sociology jargon advanced your point, and in fact I think it was a bit of a smoke screen for a rather porous argument. Case in point:  You've suggested that the term ""safe space"" be taken as its own entity. I can more or less accept that, but I don't think it's fair to dispense with the component parts entirely, either. Anyway, there are bigger fish to fry here:   It's [i.e. safe/autonomous space's] intent is not to harm or keep certain people out, but to make the people with the group feel. . . .   I find this one slippery because you elided ""harm"" and ""keep certain people out."" In fact, the policy is explicity about keeping men out. Is it designed to harm men? Probably that's not the avowed intention, but wait--   ""discriminatory segregation [is. . .] when a dominant group creates a group for the expressed purpose of harming another group (like the KKK, etc.) [emphasis added]   This is an unsatisfying comparison. The KKK is certainly a group with an announced purpose of excluding and harming. However, you're missing a vast grey area of discriminatory regulation of bodies not based on explicit intentions to harm, areas that have (correctly) been targeted by emancipatory political ventures for decades: for example, offices run like boys clubs (a la Mad Men) in which women are effectively barred from entering the corridors of power not because of any intention to harm them, but out of an ""obvious"" feeling that they don't belong.  The point I'm driving at here is the (admittedly unoriginal) one that actions cannot be entirely measured by their intentions. It is easy to say ""I'm not trying to harm you"" while actually harming you.   It does not say no men. It says yes women, trans*, and binary. It's not a treehouse with a sign that says ""no boys allowed""   Well, effectively it says exactly that. This is from the Q&A section of their website, which you linked to earlier:   Q: I am a man. Can I just come in and fill up my tires really fast?  A: We do not make exceptions, even for staff or Board members, as then the program would be de facto no longer be a program for women, trans & non binary folks. We cannot sell bikes, allow entry for quick repairs, or process rentals (including returns) unless you are woman, trans or non-binary.   They openly declare that men are not permitted. Your defense of the program is simply not accurate on this point.  What I'm getting at is this: saying ""yes"" to a certain under-represented groups in an industry is a great idea and it ought to be encouraged. However, this particular policy unambiguously says ""no."" It is, against its own best intentions, a discriminatory policy."
alberta,38h8qw,TexasNorth,-3,Thu Jun 4 07:37:46 2015 UTC,"Appealing to the definition of a portion of a term is a bit of a smoke screen itself.   This seems to be boiling down to a difference in understanding. My opinion is that it's an event for marginalized groups while your opinion focuses on the exclusion of a particular group. Which I get, the effect does end up being the exclusion of a group that is traditionally dominant in our society. And furthermore, that this causes harm.  We also seem to disagree on whether the exclusion of self-identified men causes harm. How does this cause men harm? At most it causes them inconvenience. The reason events like this are set up is because men already dominant over the normal hours of the business. As mentioned in the Q&A and over on the Alberta Human Rights Commission, these sorts of events are allowed if they address the lack of opportunity in the city for marginalized groups. Exclusion for these groups at this location is the norm. So yea, the event is going to exclude certain other groups for a small portion of time. This does not make it inherently harmful.   These sorts of groups exist all over the world. There are events set up in public spaces like this that are explicitly for gay and bi men, but you never see news articles pop claiming discrimination against women and straight men for those. Rallying against safe spaces seems to be something at is almost exclusively done against groups involving women, trans*, and non-binary people.   (I'm just gonna respond to your other post here)  The fact of the matter is that we don't know what the set up is at the bike shop, regardless of what you think the Metro is suggesting. It's not suggesting anything that is not being explicitly said. It's a secondary party trying to filter through the conversation between the man and the bike shop.   You're assuming that they're ""measuring"" the identity of every person who walks in. We don't have a clue what actually happened based on what we're told in the newspaper. How am I supposed to make an argument based on something I know nothing about? All I know is that they barred him from entry, but nothing about what led up to it. For all we know, there could have been another sign that mentioned the event next to the open for business sign, and the man asked about it. Or maybe they identified him as a man based on gender identifiers. Who knows. It's unfair to assume and speculate over what went down when we have no information on it."

Granted, especially for regular smokers, the effects are fairly subtle. But there is certainly a high that you get from nicotine. In my personal experience, I would say that the effects of nicotine are a little less subtle than the effects from caffeine. Also, nicotine is a stimulant, a fairly mild one at that, of course it doesn't cause much of a trip. ""Trip"" and ""high"" aren't words that can just be used interchangeably all the time...

Canadians as a whole from health care expenditures? I agree, but this cost would not be negated by prohibition, and I imagine that all the costs associated with enforcing the law would be much greater anyway. Or to the individual because of taxes in place partly to disincentivise use? I think that this is a problem, for a variety of reasons, including the increase in tobacco smuggling that it causes. But clearly the solution to that problem isn't to outright ban tobacco.   yeah, slap a nice label on that and sell it everywhere.   Well, no, not everywhere.. In certain businesses that have a tobacco license, and not on display, and must only be sold to adults. Yeah, why not? Are Canadian citizens not grown-up enough to make their own choices?

You say you wouldn't bother buying your smokes on a black market but I guarantee you a substantial black-market infrastructure would pop-up the day after prohibition to make it just as easy to buy cigarettes as it is now. Kids find it easier to buy weed than to buy booze. That's because black-market doesn't mean inconvenience.  Also, there already is black-market tobacco even without prohibition. It's limited, but people do sell tobacco on the street to avoid the steep taxes. Prohibit it outright and that black market gets huge."

As for those other substances, I say legalize, regulate, tax, and educate. A lot of the risks associated with these drugs are side effects of criminalizing them. Clean drugs of known concentration distributed by a licensed and accountable seller will be far safer than an 8-ball of the ""good-stuff"" delivered by some kid in a used BMW.   Take away the violence associated with drug theft and turf wars and the streets start looking a whole lot safer.

alberta,38e0rs,thedloan,3,Thu Jun 4 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"It's a sticky situation. They made it legal for so many years, now tons of people are addicted. If they just took all tobacco away people would go crazy.  I'm a smoker I wouldn't be against banning tobacco for all people born after a certain year (say 2001).  I just think it is absolutely ridiculous to ban flavored tobacco while allowing normal tobacco to be sold when the VAST MAJORITY of youth smoke unflavored tobacco."
alberta,38e0rs,DavidHydePierce,3,Thu Jun 4 22:27:52 2015 UTC,"I think you are deceiving yourself if you think that smokers would just quit if they became illegal. As someone who had tried to quit a PAD habit many times, and ultimately succeeded with an electronic cigarette, I can tell you if they ban ecigs, I'm buying cigarettes. If they ban them both, I'm seeking illegal options. And I only smoked for 10 years, been using an ecig exclusively for 2 now. I know lots of people who are nic free because of ecigs, I am not one of those people. I love nicotine. And I will inhale it in any possible way. Except nicorette inhalers, those are gross.  As a side point, I'm really sick of the think of the children attitude. I tried smoking as a youth, along with a lot of illegal substances. In the end I only took up smoking, as it was the only substance I enjoyed that left me in control. But it was all part of growing up. Kids are going to try everything under the sun that interests them. Let the children experiment."
alberta,38cyd0,weecdngeer,8,Wed Jun 3 12:26:24 2015 UTC,"Industry experience has shown that it is not economic for a company to build a refinery here... if they could make a buck at it, someone would be doing it.  So if a refinery is built, it will be built with substantial government funding, in terms of bitumen revenue in kind, (a la Northwest Upgrader), tax credits, royalty credits. It would definitely create  jobs, but it seems in consistent with the rest of the NDP platform that they would invest in creating jobs in major carbon emitting facilities, when that same money could be invested in renewable power, r&d/manufacture of energy saving technologies, carbon capture, etc.  The AB refinery would also have substantial transport issues... instead of one pipeline with diluted bitumen/heavy crude, we'd need multiple with all the many products that are created in a refinery or alternatively, many, many train or truck loads of highly explosive and carcinogenic end products travelling through our cities."
alberta,38cyd0,Kaelteth,13,Wed Jun 3 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"instead of one pipeline with diluted bitumen/heavy crude, we'd need multiple with all the many products that are created in a refinery   Actually, you are incorrect on this, although this isn't exactly common knowledge...  Oil/bitumen/etc are already shipped by pipeline in ~10,000bbl ""batches"".  Even different raw products (bitumen vs conventional oil) have different properties, but with a competent pipeline operator you can ship these with less than 1-2bbl of intermix...or if the batches are too dramatically different, you just run a PIG (Pipeline Integrity Gauge) in between the batches, which inspects the line and prevents any intermix between batches.  Have a good one!"
alberta,38cyd0,Kaelteth,4,Wed Jun 3 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"It's true that a separate pipeline isn't required for each new commodity, but more batching = less efficiency = more pipeline capacity required.  There would also likely be substantial terminal /storage facilities required. Would any of these refined products need to be held at higher pressures in order to stay out of vapor phase?  To my knowledge, there are currently no mainline/cross continental pipelines that operate with batch pigs....integrity/cleaning pigs are ubiquitous, of course, but to use pigs in day to day operations would likely require infrastructure."
alberta,38cyd0,J__rad,4,Wed Jun 3 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"Batching really isn't an issue - it takes minimal effort to batch, and is done continuously (at least out of the Hardisty terminals).  I don't know about pressures for the various products...I'm not oilpatch personally, but I have knowledge of pipeline operations.  Pigs in batching is surprisingly common, and really doesn't require any additional infrastructure overall.  My biggest question would be in terms of the storage - to the best of my knowledge, nothing is currently setup for anything but conventional oil or bitumen, and would require full cleanings to get setup for other products, plus is Cushing/etc setup to receive anything besides bitumen and oil?  I mean, I know it can all be done...but what's the cost?  I agree with you that refining isn't necessarily an answer to everything...but I'm not against it either.  I was only commenting on the pipeline transportation of product :)"

That is the difference between the private sector and the public."
alberta,38cyd0,darcyville,2,Wed Jun 3 12:46:58 2015 UTC,"They can make a profit, but not enough a a profit to recoup the really significant costs of constructing a refinery, particularly in light of the increased transport costs given we're landlocked. This is the same reason the pcs investigated oil companies to invest in oil sands projects by reducing their royalties dramatically until they recouped their investment. (Which I thought was bad, per the ndp) I agree that more jobs is good, it just seems crazy that they are focused on refining when we could 'nation build' by becoming leaders in renewables or other green technologies... what is so special about refinery jobs?"
alberta,38cyd0,elhombrerojo,3,Wed Jun 3 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"Well, there IS profit in refining.  BUT...and this is a big but...the value-add of refining vs extraction really isn't that great in terms of margin.  They (theoretically) make a pile of cash on the extraction, but refining is a marginal increase in value-add.  You are 100% correct though that the bigger value-add isn't profit, its jobs and ""nation building""."

I don't think its about the marginal profit they could make here, I think it is the much larger profit they make in Texas because operating costs are so low."

The financial motivations of a single company don't necessarily line up with the motives of a government. A case could be made for subsidies here to create jobs locally and keep more of the oil revenues in the province.

(and imo Northern Alberta is a lot better place to live and work then what i know of Arabia. Sure we could use some bigger cities further north [Edmonton is pretty far south to be the largest Urban Centre for essenchaly Northern Canada])   Basically its good that the high wages for Blue Collar work has lasted so long and made Alberta rich.

An ironworker requires 6 weeks of technical training a year as well as 1500 hours a year in the field. There are not alot of 4 year degrees that have 6000 hours of field experience attached to them. A beginners wage for a trade would be the first year apprentice wage, which is typically 50-60% of the journeyman rate."

(which is why inflation is so important in the 20-30+ years it will take wages to drop the actual number will not have dropped at all. they will still get 50$/h in 2045 wages.. but a real drop in value by 50%)

The majority of you still live in this la-la land where ""we'll just tax the oil companies, because REVENUE!""  No, what's ACTUALLY going to happen is that if you raise the taxes, you'll get less revenue because between the taxes and the royalties and the production costs, it's not longer feasable to produce the shit out of the ground because you're losing money on it.  How many of you are willing to go to work and lose money?  You show up at 8:00am with $50 in your pocket, you work all day, and when you leave, you have $30 left over.  This fantasy where you can just tax the shit out of business and oil companies so that you can build public art, pedestrian bridges and fucking bike lanes is just that - FANTASY.    Those religious degenerates in the middle east can produce oil for $30/barrel.  They're still making money hand-over-fist in an environment of $60/barrel, whereas we can't even get it out of the ground and sell it for a profit at that.  That's the difference, and you ALL need to be made aware of it.  Higher taxes aren't the solution - better efficiency is.  And by the way, that's EXACTLY the way that it's supposed to work for government as well.  Better efficiencies = less cost.  Not this ""let's give everyone a 'good government job' with a pension and benefits and hope that we can pay for it in the end"" bullshit."

Not to mention the fact you'd need to meet economic hurdles to invest period. At ""break even"" prices you'd never put money into anything... Think about yourself: you'd never spend $100 in hopes of maybe getting $100 back in a year. You need a return on your investment. And that's nothing compared to the 20+ year projects Suncor has."

Of course people come here for the money, isn't that what everybody does? Nobody goes to work for free.

They're still making money hand-over-fist in an environment of $60/barrel, whereas we can't even get it out of the ground and sell it for a profit at that.   This is the problem, and it's exactly why the oil industry's fucked. Our oil industry has actually always been fucked, we just never believed it for sure so we carried on trying to be an oil economy like everyone else. Building ours like a cargo-cult version of the US oil economy. We used politics and science and efficiency and occasionally fearmongering to shore up our position as much as we could, to make it work, and for several decades, it did. On and off, but really well overall. But our position as an oil producer was always fundamentally untenable. We entertained fanciful stories in our heads about peak oil and how the price would rise exponentially and we would be the only producer left with substantial reserves at which point boy howdy we were gonna cash in. We (and others, because it was in their benefit to do so) told these stories, and people were convinced. The world's dependency on oil would never go away, it's used for too much, it's too big to fail. And it will eventually run out.  But now the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to appear, and the world is starting to realize that a future without oil is possible. Still distant, perhaps, but possible. And it will happen long before we actually run out of oil, so it's not likely the oil will ever run out.  It seems to be relatively obvious now: cheap, easy, middle eastern oil, along with the cheapest of the already tapped western reserves, and combined with the much more expensive developments that will now have to firesale what they can just to make ends meet, will almost certainly be enough to get us there. And then some. That's what the price of oil is saying now, if you listen to it.  Our oil was always too expensive to be the energy superpower we acted like we were. It's not our fault that our oil is heavy, nasty, uncooperative and undesirable stuff. We did the best we could with what we had to work with, and it's shouldn't be any surprise that we're now coming up short.  I agree that trying to get more money out of our oil economy at this point is like trying to get blood from a stone (surprisingly relevant analogy). They're going to be in survival mode from now on. Unless I'm wrong and the price of oil skyrockets again. But I doubt that very much. The poker game is over, we made a good showing, but now we're out of chips. It's time to move on to develop other economies and other opportunities. There is a future we can build here, but we're not going to find it in the history books, and we're not going to build it on oil's shoulders. We've already passed that point.

That complexity serves nobody, neither us as citizens nor the industry, it's simply a mess of concessions and variable rates and loopholes and gotchas to make the various changes that have been made over the years more politically palatable. All it really does is make it extremely difficult to budget properly for everyone involved."
alberta,38b4wx,saikado,4,Wed Jun 3 05:50:05 2015 UTC,"Wow. I don't know where to start.   Yes Saudi and other countries can produce oil at a MUCH cheaper cost than us. But keep in mind that their country's economy as a whole is hugely reliant on oil exports. They may ""make money"" at $60 oil, but if their government budgets are based at $100+ (which they all are), they're running huge deficits by keeping prices low long term. Many (most even) OPEC nations are against keeping prices low. It's really only the Saudi's that are trying to regain market share. Countries like Iran and Venezuela are basically bankrupt and in a sustained low-price environment are likely to leave OPEC, reducing it's overall strength as a cartel. Cheap oil production is mostly gone worldwide and although the world oil demand has mostly stagnated, the demand cannot be satisfied alone by the cheap middle-east oil. Not even close. Not to mention that no one outside of the Saudis actually knows how much Saudi Arabia has. They have withheld their data for over 30 years and no one believes what they report.   In other words, the sky is not falling. Right now we still have supply > demand, but that supply is falling and when things balance out, oil will be back to $100 and life will go on. Timing of this is a different issue...and if I could tell you that I'd be sipping margaritas on a beach somewhere rather than typing at my desk."
alberta,38b4wx,g_gundy,2,Wed Jun 3 06:41:54 2015 UTC,"Seems in part to me that the capitalist market has overpriced labour compared to other jurisdictions, which is reducing profitability in the Canadian oilpatch.  You're right (yep, I know, agreement) that we can't tax these companies into fucking oblivion and expect the jobs to stay here.    But there's is also a reality that has to come where idiot kids with no experience and no skills get $20 an hour, not $40.  Where welders get $30 an hour, not $50 - also to remain competitive with other jurisdictions."
alberta,38b4wx,Kaelteth,-4,Wed Jun 3 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"Why do you care what a welder or a kid with no experience makes?  That's not up to you to decide.  It's not up to you, or the government, or Notley, or whoever the hell else you think it might be up to.    You know who it is up to?  That kid or welder, and their employer, and the free market.    If the kid applies for a job and they offer to pay him X, he can either take it or not - nobody puts a gun to his head and forces him to either work or not work there.  Same for the welder.  Same for the office dope.  Same for the secretary.  That's called the invisible hand.  They have labour for sale, and somebody wants to compensate them for their time and efforts.    The ""reality"" is that the free market determines what can and cannot be paid, and it doesn't matter whether that's $5 or $500 per hour."
alberta,38b4wx,TexasNorth,2,Wed Jun 3 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"Personally?  I don't give two fucks what these guys make.  Doesn't bother me in the slightest, and honestly I hope they make as much as they can extract from the market.  However - as you rail off all the time on how high taxation will harm business - and I agree with you - there is also the side that overly high wages will also harm business...also make them uncompetitive in the global market...also lead to economic instability and job losses.  The Alberta oilpatch COULD pay these kids anything - while oil was above $100 a barrel.  Today...these kids might need to realize that they're not getting $40 an hour to slop shit around anymore, or there may not be a job at all to go to.  Yes, I agree the market needs to decide on wages and not the government in this.  I'm not even slightly suggesting that the government come in and cap oilpatch wages.  That too would be fucking stupid.  I'm only saying that overly high wages will cause similar issues in industry as overly high taxes...send business to places where they have lower costs.  If you can't see that, then you are the greater fool."

In fact, her personal choices didn't even once enter my mind when I cast my vote for her.  I couldn't give two shits if she is 150 lbs or 500 lbs, if she enjoys getting tied up and pissed on for fun, or if she attends church and prays to Jesus, or if she goes home and takes massive bong rips every night.  I voted for her based on the public policies she supports.  And you avoided the question.  You didn't say any specific way in which her weight makes her incapable of conducting her job properly.  How does it make her unable to do the job?"

I dostruggle with sanction for this however, as IMO, it's a statement of fact and  should be treated no different than if someone was described as ""short"", ""smoker"", ""extreme skier"", ""caffeine addict"".

alberta,389220,WillieConway,7,Tue Jun 2 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'm no Fraser Institute supporter (quite the opposite you'll find), but I still accept that rent control has no economic basis. Rent control destabilizes the property market, disincents investment, and actually harms renters by limiting their mobility and placing all power and agency in the hands of the landlord. Renters in a rent control property are beholden to their landlord, as they cannot easily move elsewhere. It breaks the entire market.   Other systems are far superior such as:   Grant the money directly to renters to bring price down (does not destabilize market, does not limit renter mobility/agency) Limit property speculation by forcing units onto the market (limit number of vacant units a landlord can hold)"

So they spend 235K over 25 years and receive 300K at sale so 65K profit.    28% gain is 1.12% per annum on an asset that should match or outpace inflation.  And that's a pretty shitty case with a 30% reduction in rental income.    Stop pretending that landlords have it so difficult right now when the rental market is overpriced now."

It something uninsurable does happen...that is it...it is uninsurable.  Rent control or not will not change that fact.    And there is no such thin in insurance as ""Acts of God"".  In fact most of what would be concidered an ""Act of God"" is actually already covered under a Comprehensive Insurance Policy, or is obtainable through endorsement and extra premium.   The housing market might crash, meaning they owe more than the condo is worth   That is a risk for every property owner.  It is a risk they have to take.  Again that should not matter when it comes to rent control.    A property owner can sell the property at anytime, the new owner only has to honour the lease until it is done.

In sf, landlords are able to set terms for new tenants based on market rates, however they are only permitted to raise rents on existing tenants based on government set percentages. On it's face this doesn't seem like a bad approach, but in reality there soon becomes a wide disparity between what existing tenants pay and what a landlord could make for the same unit if they put it on the open market. Many landlords try to'incentive' tenants to move out by delaying repairs or upgrades to existing units, or otherwise making life unpleasant. Tenants become struck as they find the rent that they are paying is significantly below market rates and they have no means to move without downgrading their lifestyle. Have the ndp expanded on their plans for this policy? Are there other versions of rent control that avoid this issue?"
alberta,389220,hillkiwi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:57:37 2015 UTC,What san fran also does is called BMR program for housing. It is a program you qualify for and apply to and it lets you in the lottery for homes below market rate these cannot be removed from program and when you come to sell they have to be sold to qualified individuals. I am sure there is other stipulations. Basically it would involve government to buy properties to create and inventory for the program after which the program would run itself.   Let the market control rents the best bet would be to create exactly what someone else said which was a grant to renters. But this would mean abuse of the system and money out of the government pockets instead of landlords.

Splitting things up into more manageable things makes sense to me. Also opposition MLAs do not receive extra salary for being a critic of a specific portfolio (unlike cabinet ministers who do get additional salary, so cutting down on the number of ministers does translate into real savings), so it's not like it costs more for them to have their whole caucus engaged and doing something.

The NDP has a history across Canada of actually balancing their budget better than any other government according to places like this, but there's been a long-standing campaign by the PCs saying the opposite.

alberta,3836is,KelMage,4,Wed Jun 3 05:27:38 2015 UTC,The article appears to conclude that sales are plummeting but prices are staying relatively stable (<2% decline). Will the reduction in housing sales lead to a more dramatic decrease in price or are these variables relatively independent?
alberta,3836is,chiraz25,2,Mon Jun 1 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"Not independent, but not necessarily causal. It is most likely that at some points sellers who need to sell will become desperate. What the article is suggesting is that a lot of sellers have been proactively trying to get out of the market prior to a downturn in price, so they don't need to sell at this point."

It sounds like the Athabasca student union just doesn't have the right policies and practices in place. I think most students don't realize how much is involved in being a student union executive member depending on the institution. I don't know anything about Athabasca's but if you look at one like the UofA the executive are running a multi-million dollar organization. They spend their days attending meetings with university staff, sitting on university boards and committees and advocating for students by lobbying government directly. It's a full time job that prevents them from maintaining a full course load and they should be paid for the work they do. It might be different at smaller schools though. I think council setting the compensation would be appropriate and if that were legislated I think it would be okay. I don't really view it differently than city councils and legislatures setting their salaries.   If you mean eliminating the requirement for universities to have a student union I sincerely doubt an NDP government with numerous MLAs and cabinet ministers who were involved with student unions during their time in school would ever entertain that idea."

alberta,385iwt,Brofistrage,3,Tue Jun 2 00:32:10 2015 UTC,"Hi There,  I saw your post and I thought I might be able to provide some perspective on how you can resolve this issue. So fun fact, there are like a million more health cards out there than Albertans, therefore your issue with the wrong number could be a part of that problem. Also possible that the admitting clerk at the Royal Alex entered in the wrong number, and the typo is what's fucking you over. Anyways what you can do to potentially address this issue:  Step 1) call Alberta Health at 780-427-1432, press 2 then 0, and you will be speaking with a human being. Explain that you are being billed for medical services due to a potential issue with your health care number. They can should be able to clarify if there are any issues with your healthcare number.  Step 2) there should be a number on one of the invoices for AHS Accounts Receivable. Once you have verified that your healthcare number is intact, call these guys. You may have to argue a bit but they should be able to rebill your charges to Alberta Health and resolve the issue. Alternately, the Royal Alex has a Business Office who you can call and ask to do the same thing.  Tip: keep a log of all AHS personnel you speak with about this matter. If you are treated rudely or disrespectfully file a complaint with AHS Patient Relations department.  All these departments are open 8 to 4 so you will have to find time during work to contact them, which totally sucks but can't be helped. Sorry for your troubles, hope this is helpful.  Also unfortunately charges like ambulances, and equipment (crutches, air casts, etc) are not covered by Alberta Health but most health insurance plans that you have with an employer will help cover these items."

I know a lot of people that only smoke menthols because they can't stomach regular cigs (although their addiction would probably make it work in the end)  Like most new tobacco regulations this is aimed at discouraging smoking amongst young people. Menthols are an easy introduction to tobacco that is now not available.
alberta,380r6d,AmandoCommando,8,Mon Jun 1 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"""Have you ever drank a rum cooler vs. a hard alcohol? It's a lot easier to drink a sweet fruity cooler. I know a lot of people that only drink coolers because they can't stomach hard drinks (although their addiction would probably make it work in the end)  Coolers are an easy introduction to hard alcohol.""  Every bit of this is still true, so why shouldn't we ban coolers? Adults still want choice and the government shouldn't restrict that."
alberta,380r6d,Facticity,2,Mon Jun 1 16:19:35 2015 UTC,"Because you can drink alcohol without completely damaging your health.  Every cigarette is bad for you though, even in moderation."
alberta,380r6d,Facticity,2,Mon Jun 1 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"You're totally right, although there's a big difference between a rum cooler and a menthol, as a rum cooler is much less potent than liquor, but a menthol contains just as much nicotine in a tastier package.   The argument then is whether or not tobacco should be subject to this sort of regulation whereas alcohol is not. From my perspective inside the healthcare system I can say with certainty that tobacco costs the healthcare system much, much more than alcohol does, and that a greater proportion of tobacco users have an addiction than alcohol users. Anything else would be speculation on my part as I don't have sources.  There's a growing social stigma against tobacco and each generation is more okay with seeing it disappear. Not so with alcohol, probably because alcohol is almost ubiquitous whereas tobacco is rarely used ""casually"" or ""socially"".   So really, no it isn't ""fair"" that tobacco gets this treatment. But society is okay with it, and honestly I'm okay with it because smoking is insanely addictive and will kill you. Nobody will be weeping at tobacco's funeral.   Maybe one day, after the legalization of other, safer psychoactive drugs, alcohol will become a social pariah as usage drops. It's also dangerous and addictive like tobacco, and causes a MASSIVE amount of social problems. Alcohol falling into disuse would also be a good thing, it's just not happening anytime soon."
alberta,380r6d,Rec1umWrecker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"i agree with a lot of what you say, but I would argue that the huge number of people who have developed Korsakoff's or similar neurological dysfunction from years of alcohol abuse have a similar (if not larger) social impact than smoking, especially when costs of supports for homelessness and mental health are considered.  This whole discussion is very much the same as the ""legalize weed"" discussion. Its very difficult to morally separate the appropriateness of one drug over another, and facts are often pushed aside in favour of social standing or public opinion."
alberta,380r6d,Facticity,2,Mon Jun 1 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly alcohol must cause much greater social harm than cigarettes... people don't smoke themselves stupid than go home and beat their kids. The problem with cigarettes is that once you start, you never stop, and the health costs are easier to measure because most of the consequences are direct (cancer and cardiovascular disease). But yeah I'd be surprised if alcohol didn't cost us all more in the end.   You're right, we should look at these issues without issuing moral judgement, and listening to the evidence is what's causing the current shift in thought regarding cannabis and other drugs. Current research shows that cannabis is relatively benign when compared to alcohol and tobacco. It doesn't cause any physical dependance (it's very easy to quit and/or use casually) and the largest health risks are related to inhaling smoke, which can be eliminated with vaporizing and oral ingestion (besides the fact that nobody smokes a pack of joints a day). We definitely need A LOT more research on much larger scales to establish exactly what the long term risks are, but as it sits now, a choice between alcohol and cannabis that leads to less alcohol consumption would be a great thing health wise."

Considering your second point about diversification, I can tell from your rhetoric that you share many libertarian views, and that you seem to conflate the word ""conservative"" with ""libertarian"" (ie: free market ideals and small government.) This is a point of contention for libertarians and other left-leaning people, and quite frankly, is the point of departure for any discussion between the two. These two ideologies cannot be reconciled. I would assume this is why you receive so much flak on this subreddit. Some people believe it is the free market's duty to decide, others believe the government should have a say. We will have to agree to disagree on this point.  You are entitled to your belief, but you should know your use of the word conservative does not demonstrate a working understanding of the political spectrum of Canadian politics, or American for that matter. It is quite commonly known that the Republican party is America's conservative option, whilst the Democratic party is the centre-left option. Neither of these parties are purely libertarian, but the Republican are ardent supporters of neo-liberal policies (liberal here means the liberalization of the economy, as in the free market should be allowed to function on its own).  In all, the terms ""left"" and ""right"" change in composition throughout time. What was considered ""left"" in the early 1900s is now considered ""right"" today.

alberta,380r6d,mylastbreath,14,Wed Jun 3 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"Before the NDP cynics jump on this, let me explain why this is nothing new.   It's been a growing trend in our culture to recognize and regulate the dangers of tobacco smoke. It is an indisputable fact that tobacco causes cancer. At the same time, it is a governments job to ensure the health and safety of the citizens. Therefore, less people smoking= healthier citizens.   The NDP weren't the first government to take action against smoking, and they won't be the last. In fact, they are just adding to the flavoured tobacco ban that the PC's introduced a while back. This isn't some left wing crusade seeking to regulate everything about your life. Not everything a government does is attached to ideology. Let's be realistic here."
alberta,380r6d,zhantongz,-1,Mon Jun 1 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"Other flavoured cigarettes are rather clearly directed to young people (therefore an important state's interest could be established), but menthol is not completely directed to young people.  I am all for stricter regulation/tax and plain packaging, but banning ""populars"" like menthol would likely result in increased smuggling and unlikely result in achieving the government's objective (disencouraging young smokers). Banning things isn't very effective and risks intrusion to personal freedom (unless justified by important public interest)."
alberta,380r6d,mylastbreath,7,Mon Jun 1 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"When I was younger and working at a convenience store, I don't think I ever once encountered anyone young buying menthol cigarettes. In fact, the only people I can recall buying them regularly were older folks (mostly women, too).  I never really saw it as something marketed towards youth. Then again, I don't smoke cigarettes, so I guess I'm not paying attention."
alberta,380r6d,Tankdropper,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:20:14 2015 UTC,"I know this is anecdotal, but I faced the exact opposite growing up. Most people who started smoking when I was in junior high and high school started with menthols. Whether it is true or not, it was also something many viewed healthier as they went with the more filtered variety that is supposed to have less tar.  According to Wikipedia. Menthols marketshare is on the rise, with most of that rise coming from youths. At least in the U.S. The info comes from 2008, which was when I was leaving high school."
alberta,380r6d,rubbaneck,0,Mon Jun 1 07:34:44 2015 UTC,"""Not completely."" So they are, at least partly, targeted toward young people, yes? The report states that one third of menthol smokers are youths. Maybe they'll switch to regular cigarettes. Maybe they'll quit. Worth a try either way."
alberta,380r6d,Kaelteth,3,Mon Jun 1 04:34:38 2015 UTC,"We can still tax them, increase age of consumption, heavier fine for violators etc.  My point is banning menthol (a product consumed mainly by older folks) doesn't help the government's objective much while restricting personal freedom and ""encouraging"" (kinda) smuggling."
alberta,380r6d,Mogoliapoopoosa,2,Mon Jun 1 04:51:27 2015 UTC,"It does help the government's objective, if the objective is to convince smokers to quit. If even a small percentage of flavoured tobacco smokers decide to quit rather than switching to regular tobacco, then mission accomplished.  I believe the government's reluctance to ban tobacco outright has a number of factors: 1) taxes, 2) lawsuits (which tobacco companies will almost certainly lose, but still) and 3) it'll just piss a lot of people (ie: voters) off. Better to gradually encourage people quit by increasing taxes, forcing generic packaging with graphic warnings and banning lesser products. Slow and steady."

alberta,380r6d,nomofica,4,Mon Jun 1 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"Well, there are 2 things about menthol that make them kind of sneaky. The first is that menthol sort of anesthesizes your throat, so the smoke doesn't hurt as much when you're a new smoker. The second i'm not as sure about, but I read an article a while back that mentioned the menthol actually influences how our body metabolises the nicotine. Anyway, just as well to get rid of them."

It's such a ridiculous thing only anti smoking groups and government can buy into that.   I just don't understand the logic of  government. They ban a specific product ignoring the fact kids are not supposed to be allowed to purchase these products in the first place. Instead of cracking down on that fact they just ban them all together.   They might as well ban flavored liquors too because they get kids to drink .

This is common knowledge and requires no more proof than showing the sky is blue. He was, of course, upvoted...   It's from this thread.  The comment you are referring to is currently sitting at +1 (and note you are sitting at +1 as well). Hardly an example of upvoting. But here you are seemingly acting like a victim.  I created this account largely to call out one person. But it's fun to call out other people on their bullshit."

Your point wasn't epically downvoted, and the counterpoint wasn't epically upvoted. And if that was the trending attitude on Reddit, it would still be at those levels that you are referring to. And I do remember because I was following that conversation. It was interesting to me.  I specifically remember you because of your condescending attitude and the fact that you were jumping to conclusions about some of my values or beliefs. It was also interesting to watch you complain about how people debate, and then watch you respond with some of the crap you did. But I let it slide as you are not at the level of being an abusive asshole like some other people. And you were making some relevant points.  I shouldn't address the point you are making that has NOTHING to do with my argument, but I will. My other account is linked to me personally. I post things in more niche subreddits where it would be easy to figure out who I am. It's not about bravery. It's more related to my employment, what I talk about, and the method that I chose to call out the bullshit. Plus, who fucking cares. Go argue with someone else about whether Reddit should be anonymous or not. That's not the point I was making."

We need to pick a lake to leave the boat at and decide to take a vote.   Should I not have more say when I'm the one that paid the most?

And I think it's safe to assume that the governance is not set up that way, otherwise, why would the vote problem as stated even exist. I take your point, however.   Having said that, the majority shareholder isn't necessarily the largest financial investor. There are many other considerations, such as timeliness of investment which dictate how the shares are distributed so, it's still quite different from the proposal in OP's post: which was vote by wealth. Which is why I went there in my analogy."
alberta,37wos9,Lawtey,1 point,Sun May 31 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"The boat analogy is simply gross simplification. Let's change it a bit and say as a family we inherited the vote. I put thousands of dollars into it in maintenance, patch some holes, pay for oil to be changed etc while my siblings put no money in and just show up for lake days. Not only do they show up to use it, but also expect me to feed them and pay for their gas to get to the lake.   Now when we all have to make some kind of decision we all equally own the boat since it was inherited, but I still feel pretty chapped when they decide to throw out the motor because fossil fuels are bad."

Have more experience and skills? Make closer to $15. Need babysitting all the time? $12.  When we have to pay everyone a minimum of $15, what do we pay the good people? $20? $16?   Will our average wage go up by $5/hr, as everyone gets a bump? That's going to be a little more tricky to afford.   Also, we pay $12-15 to be able to attract better people.

I know a lot of people who float from one garbage job to another because they either refuse to get up early or do anything difficult.  People who have no intention of improving themselves, and then whinge about their situations get no pity from me."

In conservative circles burger flipper is the lowest form of life on the planet, with exception to freeloader.  But for fuck's sake, the bottom line end-all be-all is these jobs exist because they need to exist - people wan't their fucking McDonalds and Timmies after all.

It also increases the wealth that customers have and the number of people who can afford basic goods and services.  Increasing only your own company's wages doesn't have this benefit to nearly the same effect, and I feel this is really the reason why McDonalds is in favor.  There are virtually no mom and pop shops that are going to be priced out of the market by a 5% increase in business cost when consumers can pay 50% more in total."

alberta,37xa2v,Kaelteth,3,Mon Jun 1 06:33:38 2015 UTC,Have you got a source that proves an increase in minimum wage pushes inflation or are you just musing?
alberta,37xa2v,twispi,0,Mon Jun 1 07:50:24 2015 UTC,"If you make it illegal to ever be allowed to make less, then yes you are pushing up inflation.

They want your money to be worthless and therefore you will be dependant on the government to live."
alberta,37xa2v,Kaelteth,2,Mon Jun 1 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I have serious doubts it will meaningfully affect of the inflation of many goods or services. The few goods that may be inflated, are a small price to pay, for the opportunity in the province to allow poorer families to have a chance to lift themselves out of poverty, give them more chance to travel in the country, and perhaps even save a little, all opportunities not present for them in this economy. Not everyone wants to be an oilfield worker, or had opportunity to get education. I think this move is a reflection of a society's value of a full days work.  You actually believe the government wants people dependent on it? That's a very paranoid outlook. the country would have to follow suit in order for any meaningful impact in our currency at all. And that won't be happening anytime soon. More money will be in the hands of society, and less in the hands of business owners, is what will take place."

I would however say that if a business can't balance out a minimum wage of $15 per hour with a small per-unit increase in prices, then they don't deserve to be in business.  My small town Alberta has a wonderful little mom & pop fast-food type joint.  I know the owners very well, and they said to me that the average menu item will go up by about $0.15-$0.20 once the $15 minimum wage hits.  So when I go I'm going to pay around 40-50 cents more for my meal."
alberta,37xa2v,dittbub,7,Sun May 31 14:18:34 2015 UTC,"this depends on demand for their product being (at least somewhat) inelastic. there are sectors where ""small"" increases in prices have the potential for not translating to increased revenue.   i'm not in a small town, but i do run a small business with multiple locations and 20+ staff (almost all of them in the ""blast radius"" for direct increases and ripple effect increases). the proposed min. wage increase through 2018 has destroyed my 5 year plan and, barring some revenue miracle, will almost certainly result in us shedding a lot of staff as well as locations.   i can calculate the expense side effects of the minimum wage policy quite easily; however, nobody can calculate the revenue effects in any sort of meaningful way. i will be raising my prices a bit, but i have seen that demand is fairly elastic, and we could be looking at a revenue contraction after increases if things aren't thought through carefully. let's just say that i'm not particularly optimistic about this one.   for my current employees' sake, i hope mcDonald's et. al. is planning on expanding their labour force in alberta."

For most larger centres it won't impact very much.  They say very few people are on minimum wage but $10.50 is only $0.30 more and that is the average starting wage in most retail/food service.  For those who say people should try and get a better job by working for it, have you seen the cost of education?  Where are these jobs?  Show me where there are enough opportunity for everyone to make $50-75k/yr.  There is not in our economic set up.  It is set up to keep most people at a lower wage while the small percentage control the economy and get richer.  This has been a trend for the past few years.  Most jobs no longer have any benefits, Alberta has an insanely high cost for utilities.  I moved from Regina at the end of March and my cost of living had increased by almost $450/month.  My field of work is paid almost $10/hour less out here with no benefits.  Lethbridge is not as cheap as that person was saying.  Average cost for a 3bdrm house is over $1200/month rent.  Utilities are upwards of $350-400/month.  Just fees before usage is over $120/month.  How is a single parent family with parent working at $10.50/hour living in a 3 bedroom plus paying utilities supposed to live?"

Here is the comparison between Regina and Lethbridge.   http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Canada&country2=Canada&city1=Regina&city2=Lethbridge%2C+AB  Everything that matters is cheaper in Lethbridge. Enough so that the other things are also more manageable. You over stated utilities by almost double. Not too mention average wages are also higher in Lethbridge vs Regina.

alberta,37xa2v,Kaelteth,2,Sun May 31 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"I did move here on of my own choice to be closer to family.  However I am actually paying more for everything but rent.  My utilities are more since I am paying more in fees due to privatization.  My bill in Saskatchewan for both power and gas was $180.  I am paying $118/month in just fees for both out here without any usage, with usage it is over $230 on average.  Wages out here are a joke.  Starting wage for food service and customer service is $10.50 and no raises for a year.  Lethbridge has a University and College allowing for a high turnover and lower average pay for jobs.  The standard practice is to hire for 89 days and let go before the probationary period is over since they have a large pool of disposable workers to cycle through and not have to give benefits."

What city is this being based on?   If these changes were done on the city level we could see the results of these changes in a sandbox instead of a blanket one size fits all policy.

The politicians that say minimum wage should go up (to the disadvantage of small towns you say), are the same people who give big cities roughly 70 dollar per capita municipal grants and smaller towns 7000 per capita (and that's just one grant). They're the same ones who say it's ok for an 8 hour wait in an emergency department in Edmonton, yet I can waltz into the Lacomb emerg and have a 20 minute wait .   I have land and improvements worth about 3 times more than my sons house in Edmonton yet my property tax is close enough to call it even. And I see a plow down my road a lot more often too.

And again, I ask the question:  Please point me to a grant that gives small towns $7,000 per capita and urbans $70.  EDIT:  Ok, I can see where you're going...you're adding all the possible theoreticals of urban vs rural and coming up with an opinion of how the grant process works.  The problem is you are almost literally comparing apples and oranges.  Yes, there are more total dollars in the rurals than the urbans (and when you look at rurals like Greenview, Flagstaff, Provost, Wood Buffalo, etc that have huge linear taxation boons and still get provincial grants, it starts to skew.  But the urbans definitely get their share once you start to examine it not just based on per-capita, but on the infrastructure that is there & the costs associated.  Rural road building is a massive sinkhole of cost for example, but without it there almost is no rural economy.  Just one example.  Sorry I got a little pissed off there...but you can't just take a grant page and go OMG Small Towns Get Everything!!!!"

If you reread my original post you might see that my point was not a bash but a statement that apparent inequities abound but as you more eloquently than I put it... There are good and powerful reasons for it. The system is fairer than many think.   I have been an Albertan for all but 5 years of my life, all of it with PCs at the helm.

By the way rural municipality are legally obligated to provide transportation infrastructure to ALL private land within their borders. That means often you have tens of kms of road for one residence who will never pay off their share. Cities do not have that problem. That is some of the reasons rural municipalities get slightly more taxes. Another few reasons are they look after ALL the environmentally significant land in the province which is a huge benefit to cities. (but does not pay squat to the people living in those rural areas) as well all those rural hospitals you complain about.. they are not for the population that lives there they are also for the urban population that works out side of the city yet pays Zero tax to the rural municipalities where they work. Why would you think those hospitals are only for the people living there?

Federal studies have since confirmed those findings.   Existing evidence does suggest that this study may be wrong.  In addition   Schindler found snow samples 20 km from the plants had heavy concentrations of 13 heavy metals, including cadmium, copper, mercury, lead — far higher than naturally occurring levels — with lower levels 50 km from the plants.  Shotyk specifically measured levels of lead in moss and found the plants were clean — ”the lowest lead levels I’ve ever seen in moss,” he told the Journal.  Shotyk’s study did find higher than normal levels of vanadium, a heavy metal found in bitumen.  Measuring lead is not a good indicator of overall heavy metal pollution from the oilsands because bitumen contains little lead, said Blais.

With the reasonable explanation of the child being a newborn and not yet having a health care card, there should have been no issues with the cost as the $40 would have been reimbursed by the province. I highly doubt this was explained to the mother and father.  It is a catch 22 / circular issue almost, to say that a doctor should come make an assessment as to the urgency of care required. That assessment is a big part of what is being paid for in the first place. So in my mind this sort of system doesn't adequately cover enough of the possibilities to be the only rules in place.   Turning patients away should not be an option for any sort of walk in clinic. It's reasonable if someone not eligible for AB health coverage came to make an appointment for an achey ankle to be turned away without proof of other coverage or payment; but especially a child, any reasonable expectation of AB coverage should have been sufficient. End of the day the risk of seeing a couple patients and ultimately not getting paid for it is not going to make or break any physicians earnings for the day.

A lot of private clinics in Alberta advertise themselves as providing consultations, screening, and other non-emergency services.  At any rate, the Downtown Medical advertises walk-in services on their website, and the issue at this particular clinic was not that they  don't offer the service, but that they wouldn't let her see a doctor without paying $40.

A visit from a public health nurse to see how mom and baby were doing would have been much more likely to prevent this issue, IMO.

I'm curious how this clinic is different... I presume the majority of their work is funded by the public healthcare system, no? Did the $40 fee come from the fact that the patient didn't have an Alberta Healthcare number or is there a standard fee for all individuals coming in?  You mentioned in your post above, that the mother didn't realize that it was an emergency. I agree... if she had, I'm sure she would have been frantic, insistent and demanding to have her child seen. She would have left that clinic and headed to an ER or to another clinic. She would have called an ambulance on the spot.  This is a horrible tragedy, but putting it on the private clinic IMO ignores the larger issue that a new mom had little network or support to understand how to advocate for her child."

The French system combines private and public sectors to provide universal health coverage to all. Most citizens receive their insurance through their employer and almost everyone has supplemental private insurance. The majority of medical bills are paid for by the government (funds from payroll and income taxes) and the remainder is footed by individual's supplemental private insurance.   That must be an anomaly. Because there is NO way that government can assist in running an effective system. Let's go to the second best.  Italy   Healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private system. The public part is the national health service (SSN) which is organized under the Ministry of Health and it's administered on a regional basis.   Uhhhhh... third?  San Marino   Healthcare is provided at a low cost through a network of clinics and a small hospital and private healthcare is also available in the country. All citizens and registered long-term residents are entitled by law to equal access.

Perhaps it's as simple as putting a system in place of having frontline staff direct the person to the closest public-accessible clinic. Or perhaps there is a system in place for reimbursement for someone getting treatment who can't afford it. Or maybe all the fault lies with the person bringing the sick child in.

A separated shoulder does not required 2 triage nurses and a crash cart.  2)  Allow people of conscious to work in health care without having to join a public union which will spend their money on political advertising.  3)  Allow full private care with the caveat that a doctor must spend 50 +1 % of his/her time working in the public system.

alberta,37xcef,GeekSnozzle,0,Sun May 31 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"Uber is operating Illegally within all Jurisidictions in Canada.  Posititive or Negative experiences aside, this should not be allowed to continue due to lack of will to enforce the laws applicable.  They are not complying with Provincal Insurance Acts or Provincal Highway Traffic Safety Acts.  Most drivers do not have proper insurance or license to be operating a vehicle as a ride for hire.  Having read the insurance policy Uber claims will cover its drivers it does not provide the coverage people think it does.  Uber is putting all their drivers at a huge Financial Risk in the event of an accident and letting their drivers get away with Fraud.  Just looking at the City of Edmonton and how they have been ""dealing"" with the issue.  A few hour sting against uber drivers 1 time only is not any real kind of deterrant since they have kept operating.  I hear a lot of good things about the Service that Uber provides.  And if Uber were to make their drivers comply with insurance and licensing needs they should be welcome with open arms.  If anything they have forces the Cab industry to change and reform and offer better service.  Every Insurance company in Canada has stated they will not cover an Uber Driver under personal insurance.  Commerical Insurance already covers this type of risk.  As some one in the insurance industry companies like Uber, Lyft, Couchsurfing and Airbnb are HUGE risks!!  Using your property in such a way violates your insurance and in the event of a claim...it will be denied. In the case of an Uber driver...they could face huge problems if they have an accident.  Nothing like getting upwads of a $200,000 invoice from your insurance company to be reimbursed money they paid on your behalf to a third party when you violated your insurance contract.  On top of not paying to fix your vehicle, or your injuries.  TL:DR People should check with their insurance providers before they decided to get involved in any of these sharing activities.  If you do not you are taking a huge risk.  Can you afford to lose your vehilce or your home and get nothing in return?"

alberta,37rsg1,thedloan,2,Fri May 29 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think the best thing the PCs did was to link minimum wage to inflation (or whatever index they used).  Also, I think it's a particular prejudice that a lot of people, on both the left and the right, have regarding minimum wage earners. That no one should depend on minimum wage to make ends need and everyone should be improving their standing through education or training. Either by pulling up their bootstraps or by public funding of educational programs.  But there are people in every society who, for one reason or another, cannot ever improve. The mentally or physically challenged and the people who below average intelligence, for example. Some of them will never improve by taking a course or two.  Do they deserve to live in squalor?  Personally, I think that any person who works an honest 40 hours a week should be able to live off that.  *I didn't think of this issue on my own, but I read it from a book which had some weird title like ""10 issues that science can't solve"", so don't believe that I thought of anything this deep."

They're also some of the most heavily taxed countries on the planet, while suffering from high unemployment.  Take a moment to remember that none of these places decided to jack their wages that high overnight, but they'll be phased in over several years to gauge the effects; if it turns out that small businesses aren't worth running at those wages, I can't help but wonder what proponents of high minimum wages will chose to blame as they desperately try to deflect criticism from minimum wages that are too high to make a small business worth running.  That's not a very compelling argument for raising wages; it's an argument for lowering the cost of living."

alberta,37sn2i,vaguelyswami,4,Sat May 30 01:53:13 2015 UTC,The paper this post references is not in any way applicable to the policy that is being proposed.

There are many studies available from much more credible sources that directly contradict the findings of these researchers.

Second, you misunderstand the article. The main study it refers to itself refers to reams of other studies--way too many to be lumped together with one offhand remark. These look at both short term and longterm effects.  Third, we are not ""about to be subjected to an abrupt and extreme shock""--we are about to see the phasing in of wage increase with the intention of it being realized over the course of three years.  While it is true that no study will exactly tell us the repercussions in our own province, that's science for you. It works through finding patterns in diversity, which are tentatively put forward as predictions."

Do you have any, or was that just a lazy gambit? Did you even read the article? It addresses some of your concerns. Of particular relevance to mitigate your worry are the facts that (a) Alberta's CPI has increased much, much quicker than it's minimum wage or the national average, so in many senses this 3-year increase is just catch up; but also (b) an unusually small percentage of Albertans (compared to other jurisdictions) actually earn minimum wage, so the ""abrupt"" shock you refer to is not going to be earthquake.

alberta,37qx7z,WillieConway,6,Sat May 30 04:45:59 2015 UTC,"That's a long discussion, but here are two of the main reasons. I should say that I think they are much more sensible than they are given credit for, but there are some major holes in their plans in my opinion.  Their healthcare policy involves creating private clinics. This policy appears, on the surface, to be a good solution to wait times, but it has some nasty repercussions. Among them are these  (a) as soon as you make private and public healthcare compete, wealthier people will tend to go to private healthcare, effectively reducing pressure to improve the public system. In other words, introducing private healthcare introduces greater inequalities to the providing of healthcare.  (b) Introducing private healthcare very likely entails introducing some sort of private health insurance, and such policies tend to charge higher premiums for pre-existing conditions (diabetes, cerebral palsy, etc). They effectively discriminate against sick people.  I also think their environmental policy is vague. They say, for instance,  that they plan to ""ensure Alberta’s standards for CO2 emissions are in line with national and international standards."" Which standards, and how will they do that? Danielle Smith (when she was leader) mentioned supporting the Copenhagen accord, but I'm not sure that's on the table still. At any rate, any effective greening of the province will need to happen in part by providing stricter regulation of the oilsands (among other industries). However, the Wildrose proposal to let corporations operate unfettered by ""artificial"" obstacles (such as taxation) doesn't square with this idea of regulation. They have mentioned offering incentives to consumers who switch to green energy sources, which is great, but they don't seem to have a strong plan to regulate industry. They have the carrot, but not the stick."

You must have had a stroke last night, because your last few comments are at a whole other level of stupidity. Do you smell burnt toast? Do you feel a tingling in your left arm? I'm concerned you suffered irreversible brain damage /u/texasnorth.  You're assuming that your all encompassing labels of ""liberal,"" ""communisits,"" ""socialists,"" ""marxists"" blah, blah blah, aren't taking care of their kids or their family (or don't want to). You are either blatantly ignorant of the argument, or you're just being a fuckwad.  Many people (and maybe you instantly label these people as communists/marxists/socialists or whatever fucking name you pull out of your ass) recognize that their are situations where people need assistance. Sometimes it's because of their own stupid fucking choices. But many times, it's because of situations that are beyond their control (mental illness (or their parents having mental illnesses), their parent's decisions, i.e. FASD, a parent getting sick or dying).  The concept is that by providing some assistance to society as a whole, especially youth, all of society benefits.   But wait... I know what you're thinking, but let me try and comfort you in a small way. This isn't some slippery slope where all of a sudden you provide some assistance and you instantly become Soviet Russia (this is a HILARIOUS argument, by the way).  So let's start slow. I would like to understand the limits of your pure ""capitalist/free market"" utopia you dream of at night.   If a kid's parents die, should the kid get any assistance from government? If a someone gets sick, is it the responsibility of the person getting sick to pay for the entire treatment?  Should there be limitations on businesses hiring youth? For example, should youth be allowed to work 14 hour shifts in unsafe situations for dollars?   I really want answers to these questions, because I really would like to know how fucking ignorant you are.  Most of the most successful countries in the world have some sort of blend of socialism with a free market. Actually, all first-world countries have some sort of blend of socialism and a free market.  You see, theoretical models of economy are great. And discussing prefect models are wonderful. But people are fuck-ups. People are greedy, manipulative bastards. And people are incredibly innovative and generous. And people are gullible, dumb fucks who think they can get something for nothing. And theoretical models are as useful as engineers discussing frictionless spheres in a vacuum. They provide a model to base theories on. But in the end, you have to work in the real world.  You see that? There is a wide range of people. You need to provide opportunities for people to excel, and provide protections for people that are vulnerable. Providing a few free lunches and schooling is relatively cheap, because in the future, that kid will not be a burden to society, but will benefit the province.  Pure socialism/communism/marxism (which is the model you produce when people start talking about raising the minimum wage or any mention of the NDP) does not work. But neither does capitalism in its purest form. So what we are talking about is where the arbitrary line in the sand is. Is the U.S. better than Germany? Is Germany better than Sweden? Is there something we can learn about the WORKING models in U.S., France, Germany, Russia, Slovakia, etc. (both what is working and what isn't working). There are definite benefits of some of the free market concepts in the U.S. But the lack of government intervention in social assistance (and government intervention in big businesses, such as the bailouts and lobbying) is something we may want to avoid.  Here's another example. Our government provides government grants and opportunities for small businesses starting out. Now, from a capitalistic point of view, this isn't fair (fuck them, right?). But it's recognized the first few years of a business are the toughest. And if you provide assistance in those years, that business has a much greater chance of being successful, becoming a larger business, and being a major contributor to jobs and the economy as a whole. See how that works? A small investment provides a bigger return later on.

alberta,37opwu,Moose_Herder,8,Fri May 29 05:07:41 2015 UTC,I believe 4x01 was shot and set in Alberta. It opens with a Telus tech dying a horrible death.
alberta,37opwu,shootamcg,3,Fri May 29 06:58:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of Season 1 was shot in Canada. In episode 1, I caught a couple Canadian flags."
alberta,37opwu,joetravers,7,Fri May 29 13:59:52 2015 UTC,"most of all the seasons and episodes were shot in Canada, the FBI HQ is the UBC library, moving between the various coastal locations including vancouver its self into the interior BC and the rockies you could emulate any small town american site due to the various climates mixed with the farms/ranches/small towns and overall look in BC."

alberta,37opwu,joetravers,1 point,Fri May 29 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"ya, it was largely based in BC for almost all filming of all the seasons.   Weird fact for shows filmed in BC.  Psych was filmed in vancouver, its set in Florida, so they just shoot in warehouses and when they were out side they had a whole garden department that would put out palm trees and tropicals for the shoots to make it look like Florida.  Tax savings/cost of shooting was that much cheaper that they could afford that with the plants.  Hopefully this new film studio they want to build in Calgary will help us get more of the Vancouver tv shows moving here."
alberta,37opwu,alpain,2,Fri May 29 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"That'd be terrific!  Alberta has very enticing film-tax-credit lures, and, like BC, can be sold as anyplace.

If we work together, we could turn Alberta from a well off, self sufficient ""have"" province into the progressive-liberal nightmare that so many of you desire to live in.    Let's just impliment all of these Marxist ideas that you occupy-type economic genisuses want to see implimented, and let's do it quickly so that we can hasten the eventual collapse of this once great province.  The sooner you burn it to the ground, the sooner people like me can get back to work rebuilding it.    The collapse will be painful to many of you, but at this point, what I'm absolutly convinced that you need is pain.  I want you to have to justify your choices to your children, and I want you to have to explain to them why mommy or daddy voted against common sense and personal freedom.

alberta,37n92h,TexasNorth,11,Fri May 29 05:12:43 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but education is investment in future generations. Smaller, better equpped classes lead to more enthusiastic learning and more capable teaching. A more educated populace leads to a more creative, ambitious, and tolerant society. People who enjoy school are more likely to go into post secondary education, and post-secondary educated people have repeatedly be shown to have lower crime rates, longer longevity, less risk of heart rate, and on and on. Spending on education is the very opposite of short-term thinking."

alberta,37n92h,serfking,17,Fri May 29 05:23:25 2015 UTC,"They do. I can't build roads, schools, or hospitals. If I tried it would be much more expensive. The government can negotiate deals on the behalf of millions of people.   And I recognize that without free schools and subsidized post secondary I wouldn't have had the opportunity to go to medical school because I come from a family that never could have afforded it. I recognize that there are people that are simply shit out of luck and maybe my tax dollars can help them get back on their feet. I'll make a lot more than $100,000 one day, and I won't mind paying more, because I'm only making that much thanks to the society that brought me up.   Some people are not like me. There are some that are completely self sustaining individuals that do as much they can to avoid using communal services. They work hard and suffer but sometimes they reap great rewards. Good for them. So we can all suffer so that a tiny number of us makes it, for the sake of personal liberty, or we can pool our resources and contribute to a social system that gives everyone a chance. One only needs to look at the worlds most successful societies to see which yields greater results."
alberta,37n92h,serfking,0,Fri May 29 06:01:52 2015 UTC,"for the sake of personal liberty   Whoa... Hold on a sec. What you are describing is a very different kind of liberty. The liberty you speak of is freedom from, at the expense of others, where as /u/TexasNorth is talking about freedom to do/be not at the expense of others, but afforded to him by his own personal responsibility. I'll explain why one kind is not as great as you think it is and actually ends up harming society as a whole, rather than helps it.    I can't build roads, schools, or hospitals. If I tried it would be much more expensive. The government can negotiate deals on the behalf of millions of people.   Not exactly. You, personally, are not capable of spending $1M+ per mile to build a road and maintain it, but that doesn't eliminate the value in such a thing. People will still want roads, regardless of how they are paid for and people will find a way to satisfy that need and demand regardless of whether the government is involved or not. Private roads and highways have always and currently do exist around the world.   In regards to regotiation... the government can negotiate, yes. But just because they do does not mean the best deal for the end consumer is achieved. There is also the issue of the ""free rider"", but even if we disregard that it still overlooks the fact that the government holds a monopoly over the commodity of roads. There isn't as much incentive to offer the best value product, because 1)the government has no competition (because it does not allow any) and 2) the financing to pay for new roads and continued upkeep is taken via taxes - essentially if the government ""needs"" the money it can just take it. If you don't agree, just try not paying your taxes because you feel the government is wasting your money. You're basically supporting the government's way of doing things even though fundamentally, a successful alternative is not even allowed to exist.    I wouldn't have had the opportunity to go to medical school because I come from a family that never could have afforded it.   If the sheer number of needs based grants and scholarships are not enough, loans would also bridge the funding gap for you. Take for instance Hardvard, Stanford and a number of Ivy league universities. Several offer 100% free tuition exclusively for lower income families. The threshold isn't even that low, $75k or higher in some cases. These schools are largely merit based though, but that is the tradeoff when balancing access. You can have access offered through full funding and more merit based admittance, or you can have much more broad access as long as you pay for it, with lower merit standards. You can't have both.    I recognize that there are people that are simply shit out of luck and maybe my tax dollars can help them get back on their feet.   Why are you assuming the government knows how to distinguish proper recipients compared to you? I personally know people on welfare who were engaged in under the table work for cash, but kept receiving welfare on the side because they knew how to not get caught. And why should I be forced, via my taxes, to pay for these social programs no matter how inefficient they are when I help people the way I decide with my own money and time? One thing I notice about people who are so gung-ho about social programs out the wazoo, is that they think throwing (other people's) money at the problem allows them to take credit for social change. Really what it does is keep the reality of the situation ""out of sight, out of mind"". I can tell, because the people who are like seem to think the poor are somehow exempt from the pitfalls of human nature, simply because they are poor. It's mostly because they don't spend any time around them in the first place to see what is true and what is not. The sad truth is many of them cannot be helped because they do not want to help themselves, and throwing more money at the situation does nothing but leave the taxpayer poorer with nothing to show for it.    I'll make a lot more than $100,000 one day, and I won't mind paying more, because I'm only making that much thanks to the society that brought me up.   It's easy to say that now, but you only do because you support the general idea of taxing ""the rich"". i.e. the your future self or the nameless, faceless people. To allow you do do that you are doing now, which is much more tangible. The reality is, nobody forced you to do to medical school. It's great that you are, don't get me wrong... But the costs to train a single doctor in Canada is extremely expensive to the taxpayer. By attending medical school (optional) you forced someone to subsidize your education and pay for it with their income (not optional).    There are some that are completely self sustaining individuals that do as much they can to avoid using communal services.    Although I understand that it is in every human's best interest to take advantage of things like subsidized education, I can assure you that you will not overpay on your taxes to pay back the full amount for your training. ""Avoiding using communal services"" doesn't mean that you're a net contributor simply by not being on welfare.    or we can pool our resources and contribute to a social system that gives everyone a chance.   Nobody is pooling anyone's resources. Our elected officials decide what to do with our tax money and really have no obligation to provide any services that benefit anyone in particular. And if they need more money to cover their asses because of poor spending habits and deficit, they just use the law to extract more taxes at the expense of those who are productive.   You may disagree with me in this premise, but you might want to examine why you take the side you do. Of course you would like to think this system is all great and wonderful. You're benefiting from it hugely! This is the problem - the greater the government targets any group with benefits (gained at the expense of another group) the more that group will say the government is the more effective way of planning the economy/education/healthcare etc.    One only needs to look at the worlds most successful societies to see which yields greater results.   Actually, the countries with the highest living standards in the world also correlate strongly with business and economic freedom, with the exception of Norway who has a large amount of oil money concentrated among a relatively small population. Singapore for example went from a 3rd world country to a 1st world country in one generation largely due to its free market-minimal government approach. It continues to outperform most if not all developed countries in terms of living standard improvements because it is one of/if not the freest economies in the world without any natural resources, mostly private health care and very low taxes."

Klein, who I'm assuming is your hero, had a plan to get rid of the deficit. What he didn't have a plan for was for the children and the grandchildren of Alberta. He cut spending by 20 per cent. That's going to impact some important areas of the province. He even sold assets of the province that were making money (and would continue to make money today for the province), just so he could pay off the debt. I'll simplify it for you. If you sell something for $400 that is making you $500 per year, that's a bad business decision - regardless of how much debt you have accrued.  Now here are some facts that you seem to find so distasteful.  Let's look at some Alberta populations in 1996  Cochrane - 6,612  Grande Prairie - 29,242  Spruce Grove - 14,123  Medicine Hat - 45,892  Now let's look at those populations in 2014  Cochrane - 20,078  Grande Prairie - 55,032  Spruce Grove - 29,526  Medicine Hat - 61,180  With growing populations in new areas of the province, you need school, towns, upgrading or roads... all sorts of development. And you need to have some sort of planning system in place to ensure that the future Alberta has the things required to ensure success. Sometimes that means running a deficit.   Many communities are in dire need of schools. And hospitals, And upgrades in transportation (public transit and road improvements). If they were done when upgrades were cheaper. If they were done when costs were lower. If they were done when an upgrade was possible instead of a complete rebuild, and if it was spread over multiple years, it is quite possible we wouldn't be in the situation we are in now."
alberta,37n92h,JackOCat,6,Sun May 31 18:01:10 2015 UTC,Maybe you are not in school or have a child in school right now but there is an argument that investing education is the has the most profound return on investment.

So the additional 103 million doesn't go to it (unless you consider it going to the raise when they hire new teachers). Most probably the funding is for restoring cancelled school programs (ESL, special needs, etc.) and hiring new teachers. Building school doesn't cost education funding, it's from infrastructure."

alberta,37n92h,Thomas_Gabriel,4,Sun May 31 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"Some teachers are worth 100k but there are lot of teachers who are not.   The problems with public sector unionization is that the employer (government taxpayer), does not have the option of getting rid of bad employees. The union doesn't have to fight for many worker rights (because of existing labour laws), so all that is left is to get more money. If the union can get more money for teachers they can get more money for themselves (they take a cut). A union wants as many teachers on the payroll as possible because that is their only source of income. The union does not care about the quality of labour."
alberta,37n92h,OriginalSyn,5,Fri May 29 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, what I hate about public sector unions most of all...  They reward mediocrity while preventing rewarding exceptionalism.  A shitty employee can easily be terminated, although its more difficult than a non-union environment.  However, the mediocre employee has zero fear, and there's absolutely no way as management you can truly reward the exceptional people...everyone gets the same compensation based on position/tenure/etc.  So the exceptional become mediocre."

alberta,37n92h,Not47,9,Fri May 29 10:56:49 2015 UTC,How would you fund education if it were up to you and what do you think are appropriate levels of funding?
alberta,37n92h,NorseGod,-17,Fri May 29 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"You're asking a fucking Libertarian how he would ""fund public education?""  LOL, hilarious.  Education should be funded by the users of said education, or more specifically, their parents.  In a TexasNorth administration, there wouldn't be a ""public school system"", but instead a series of private schools that the parents themselves would be required to fund entirely on their own.    Right now, we tax and confiscate from everyone to fund a small number of people who actually receive the benefit.  This is, to me, unacceptable.  There is only one ethical or reasonable way that ANYONE should be able to confiscate wealth from me because of their own personal situation, and that is disability.    It is not my job to pay for your childs education - period.  It is not your neighbors job to pay to educate your children - period.  This is YOUR responsibility.    REMEMBER!  The first rule of TexasNorth is: personal freedom ~ personal responsibility.  If you want to have children, that's fantastic, but you will be required to educate your children via either home schooling, or a privately funded facility.  No longer should we tax and confiscate from people who did not make the PERSONAL CHOICE to have your children.  In our system now, we basically put a gun to the taxpayers head and say ""pay up.""  This is how totalitarianism works.  This is the type of situation that would happen in a communist country.  Our current system ""spreads the cost"" of each child's education amongst everyone so as to not be such a financial burden on the parents, which in my opinion, only encourages sloth (check), and a complete disconnect from the school system in which your child is participating (check).  The needs of YOUR children are supposed to be fulfilled by YOU.  Not me, not the government, and not your fucking neighbor.    This is how freedom works.  Without even replying, I'm sure that you find this type of system to be abhorrent, which tells me that you're a slothful, indoctrinated lemming, that's been conditioned to rely on government in every circumstance, which I find to be quite shameful of you.    See, you liberal types are always going on and on about how ""we should think outside the box"" and ""come up with creative solutions to our problems"", but you're neither.  Your solution to every problem always seems to be the inevitable cry for ""MORE GOVERNMENT!""    Having to directly pay for your child's education IS, in our current society, outside the box, and pretty fucking creative.  I mean, not really, but it is.  It just goes to show you how far this country (and world) has gone away from the principles of freedom and personal responsibility, and how because of people like you, we will never get either back.    Make sure you tell your kids how much you hate freedom when they go to bed tonight.  I'm sure they'll be really proud of you.  :/"

HOLY FUCK. What crazy utopia does your fucking delusional mind create. Where do I even start with this one?  Okay, first, infrastructure has to be built. And this take some time. So who pays for that? When you're seventeen do you decide then and there that you are going to have kids ten years down the road and you're going to live in a specific community, so you start providing funds for the infrastructure of a school and the education of who you plan to have as the teacher for your child?  What happens if you are infertile? Do you get that money back and that teacher gets a paycut? How about if you move? Are you penalized? Or do you get your money back and the funding for that school disappears? How about when a class size changes from one year to the next? Does the teacher get a pay cut and less resources? Or when another kids comes in, they get more money? Hey, let's get ten more kids into our school and maybe we can afford a sport's program!  And talk about a fucking caste system. Anybody with any sort of money would be able to send their kids to schools with the latest and greatest technology, teachers that are top of the line (because if I'm paying that kind of money, you'd better believe that I would expect my kid's teacher to be the best of the best) and a classroom with an appropriate number of kids - enough to be social but not too much that it impedes on my kid's education.

Who pays...  You know what, lot's of people learn better from stories. So let me tell you a story - a story set in your fictional world.  There is a small town that has a shitty school and shitty teachers. Because of this, no family wants to move to the town. They would rather move to the town next door that has a nice school built with great teachers.   Not only is no one moving to the town, but anytime someone has a kid, they move because the school is that shitty. You see, it's too expensive to upgrade, no parent wants to spend that amount of money to upgrade it (or has the patience to wait for the school to be renovated or torn down to build another one), so they move.  Now the largest business owner knows this is fucking over the businesses in the town. Families are stable. They spend a lot of money. Families are vital to ensure economic stability. And it's important for towns to grow. Or, at the very least, maintain their population.  So this business owner, he's one smart motherfucker. He knows if they build a top-of-the-art school, more families will move to the town. Those families spend money like a Fort McMurrayite on a Friday, and the town will be saved.  But he's a good, /u/texasnorth - type capitalist. Why should he spend the money if EVERYONE in town is going to benefit from families moving in (which requires the building of the school).  So he comes up with an idea. He's going to propose that EVERYONE in town donates the same amount of money to get the school built.  Well some of the business owners, the smaller businesses, think they should have to spend a percentage on building the school, because they won't benefit the same way that the big business does.  Other people come forward and say that they don't work in this town, they commute, so why should they have to spend money on building the school.  Even more people come forward and say ""why is this businessman making decisions for the town. I want someone to represent me for the best interests of the entire town.""  They start to do research. And they find that every other developed first world has a system of taxations in place and people in charge of looking out for the needs of the town. They also find that their town used to have this in place.  They ask themselves ""What dumb fuck removed this system that seems to work for all developing countries?"" They find out it was /u/texasnorth, who tried to have an idealistic capitalistic world without taking into consideration reality.  And what happened to /u/texasnorth you ask? Well he died from giardia because there was no one to have oversight on the drinking water of the town."

Alberta education is sold overseas to developing nations.  A former Tory Deputy Minister was hired by the UN to assist in that technology transfer.

alberta,37nozr,TheNewSovietMan,1 point,Thu May 28 23:51:07 2015 UTC,"With our dropping innovation and increasing reliance on the oil sands, we seem to be heading towards a petrol economy. This type of economy is regressive because of its environmental impacts and connection to high levels of income inequality.   This is the problem Alberta faces exactly. For too long, the PCs have been putting their eggs in one basket. The province is rich now, but that wealth is the result of a valuable resource combined with hard work. The missing ingredients are innovation in terms of ways to make money as well as its sister, diversification of the economy through the cultivation of other industries. Look at South Korea--a country basically devoid of resources that has turned itself into a global player through hardwork and creativity.   With the resource wealth Alberta has been blessed with, it ought to have some serious research institutions on par with Stanford, Berkeley, or other big money, global leader schools."

alberta,37lftm,rednuck,-4,Thu May 28 19:29:52 2015 UTC,That's ok.  Spend money?  Pay taxes.  Don't spend money?  Keep your money.  I like it.
alberta,37lftm,fyeah,9,Thu May 28 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"ya, let's make corporations pay more taxes, and discourage individuals from spending their money. That's a solid economic plan."
alberta,37lftm,rednuck,5,Thu May 28 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"That's what the rest of the world does bro.   What do you prefer: Tax your income harder or tax people that spend more money?   Edit:  At some point I hope that more Albertan's start to recognize that the gravy train that has been lower taxation in the province will come at a cost.  We will either have degrading infrastructure (see all other provinces except for Alberta), reduced services, or higher taxes.  The PC platform was also to increase taxes in 2016, the difference between what the NDP seem to be doing and the PC's were actually doing seems to be actually trying to solve problems not trying to just band-aid everything.  It's like the people in my condo, nobody wants increases in condo fees but everybody wants nicer flowers in the flowerbeds and new carpet in the hallways.  That shit isn't free.  We've been running on fumes for a long time, it's time to update our economy to match."
alberta,37lftm,fyeah,15,Thu May 28 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention the higher taxes, I actually agree with the NDP's progressive tax plan. but PST hurts everyone, it hurts the working poor the most though. an extra 5% on most the things you purchase mean nothing to a rich person, but could mean everything to a poor person.  It will also hurt my line of work terribly if its not thought out well, I need to spend a ton of money to make money, add another 5% onto that and things get rough."
alberta,37lftm,rednuck,-6,Thu May 28 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"So you've listed why you don't like it, which is fine, but do you have a before idea?   Yes some businesses with small margins may close, the same. thing happens when corporate taxes change.   And PST is basically a luxury tax, not a bare essentials tax. The working poor will largely be OK, unless of course they're financing something they can't afford in the first place."
alberta,37lftm,fyeah,3,Thu May 28 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"The before idea is already in the new government's platform. Progressive taxes, raise corporate taxes, review the royalties. Pray for oil prices to go up and don't screw that up like the last people.    Then a last ditch effort, pst at an affordable rate, 1-2% etc with reviews every few years. Or make it an actual luxury tax(new cars, atv's, boats etc) instead of deodorant, used cars, mobile phone bills, internet bills, car repairs, home repairs.    While the gravy train was squandered away, it gave people a reason to call Alberta home. It can still be a great place without driving everyone into poverty to support the Notley Crew make it rain policies."
alberta,37lftm,rednuck,-1,Thu May 28 23:17:22 2015 UTC,Sooooo....you're saying exactly what they are doing. And ultimately PST if necessary.... which is exactly what they're going to do....if necessary.
alberta,37lftm,fyeah,4,Fri May 29 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"ya except they are probably going to skip reasoning and make pst 5-10% on everything with the excuse ""the pc's messed everything up"""
alberta,37lftm,rednuck,-1,Fri May 29 04:21:59 2015 UTC,So based 100% on your own speculation you're talking about being on with PST but not too high of a PST rate?

alberta,37pvdi,ircanadian,2,Fri May 29 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"Surprise surprise. Someone at the Fraser Institute thinks privatized healthcare is a good idea. Here are a few ideas why it isn't:   If you offer a two-tier healthcare system such that the rich can fast track medical procedures, then you effectively weaken the public system. It's better to keep the pressure on to improve the public system. Think of all the costs associated with running a healthcare system. Now add on a profit incentive. What you get are either (a) more costs or (b) cut corners. Some version of privatized medicine presumably will require private medical insurance. People with pre-existing conditions (diabetes, congenital heart defects, etc.) will likely end up paying higher premiums.   I realize there's a lot more in this article than just the healthcare system, but the myopia of the Fraser Institute on that issue is just one of the reasons they ought to be tuned out."
alberta,37pvdi,WillieConway,0,Sat May 30 02:40:59 2015 UTC,Single payer system with private partnerships seems to be working. Add in outsourced operations to that mix still in the single payer system and we will save money and lives as well as significantly reduce local wait times.
alberta,37pvdi,WillieConway,1 point,Sat May 30 06:28:58 2015 UTC,"They are working alright, but there are concerning signs. Case in point is this story about a mother who was faced with paying $40 to see a doctor. Basically, the result was a mom who took the responsible step of getting a sick baby to a clinic but then, being told she needed to pay $40 to see the doctor, was essentially asked to make a decision as to whether or not it was an emergency (she thought her baby was just sick, but he ended up dying). It would be much better had a doctor made that call rather than someone without medical training, which would have happened in a free clinic.  Yes, it is only one example. Nonetheless, combined with the other points I mentioned above, there are some worrying features about privatizing medicine. I'd much rather see efforts spent toward making public healthcare more efficient and effective."

The combined cost of our Wind phones are 90$ per month, including 2 phones with unlimited data and the other with unlimited calling only. My sister on Bell pays 85$ per month for limited data.  My point is that Wind is the best way to go, especially for city slickers like us. But even when you leave the city occasionally, Wind's rates are quite reasonable and will still save you hundreds of dollars each year. And yes, you can get an iPhone on Wind.  Wind has some plans available for people in rural areas such as yourselves which will still save you money when compared to other businesses. I recommend that you check them out."

As a result, he said, Alberta must remain competitive, and as American demand dwindles, Canada must open new markets by building pipelines.   Ah there's the reason. Lower demand for their product.

I believe that government is rarely the solution to any problem, and is likely to make the problem worse.  I believe that you and I should be free to make mistakes, and that rebounding from mistakes builds character.  I DO NOT believe that it's governments job to shield you from making mistakes, or that it's governments job to correct mistakes that you've made.    I believe that you should be allowed to self-destruct, and that you shouldn't expect the government to bail you out if you do.  I believe in free market capitalism, the invisible hand, and that the private sector should be allowed to operate with the least amount of encumbrance from governmental rules and regulations.    I believe that you and I should be free from government persecution of any sort.    I believe that low tax rates and low regulations help to grow the economy much better than high tax rates and high amounts of regulation.

I think you're an asshole because you treat anyone who you disagree with such disdain.  Overall, I mostly agree with your post.  I have a few disagreements...  I believe in personal freedom and accountability.  But I also believe your freedom ends where harm to another person begins.  I believe that government plays a very important role in performing services that are not ROI-based areas.  Recreation.  Infrastructure.  Health Care.  Education.  Areas like that...and unfortunately, those things cost big bucks.  I believe that in a wealthy society like we have, people should not be left to die in a gutter.  No, they don't deserve free mansions either, but IMHO nobody deserves to go without BASIC food, shelter, clothing & medical care.  Keyword: Basic.  Nobody should WANT the ""freebie"" - it is a source of survival of last resort.  I believe in the free market, but I also believe that without regulations the free market will completely fuck labour.  I believe in unions, although I think most unions are also fucked in the head.  The examples I can give...I worked in an office where management ran amok and fucked the workforce hard during the last recession...they knew we had nowhere to go to as nobody was hiring, and they fucked us as hard as they could get away with.  A union could have helped protect us as the workforce.  However, I am now ""the boss"" in a union environment, and they protect the mediocre while preventing me from rewarding exceptionalism.  I fucking hate that.  I believe that EVERY worker deserves a living wage.  No, the McJob shouldn't pay as well as the Engineer, but if the guy at McD's is working his ass off full time, if he is a single person he should be able to survive and put a couple bucks away at the end of the month too.  Granted, if he spends himself into oblivion with luxuries, I don't ucking feel sorry for him either.  I believe that taxes should be kept as low as possible, but that taxes also fund essential services, and as such are a necessary evil.  I also believe, and I know you disagree, that many social programs that cost us cash also can achieve a high ROI - allowing people to achieve in the workforce and collect more tax revenue from them.  EDIT:I don't think you're wrong for being a conservative, but I also don't think I'm wrong for being a bit of a leftie.  I honestly believe we would achieve the absolute optimum results possible if we stopped making everything ""Us vs Them"" and actually collaborated together and reasonably discussed ideas, opinions and beliefs.    Ive said before, and I'll say again.  I don't think the NDP is some magic political party that has all the answers.  I don't think that the Wildrose are either.  But I support the NDP this time around, because I actually think Ms. Notley might actually be capable of forging collaborations with the other members of government AND industry to accomplish good things.  I'm not saying I'm right, but that is my belief.  If I'm wrong, I'll be among the first calling for the crucifixion.  But I'm not going to start screaming how the sky is falling before they enact a single piece of legislation."
alberta,37i814,LandmanCA,3,Wed May 27 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"This poll is sorta confusing. Alberta already has a carbon tax called the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation that levies a $15/tonne on carbon for heavy producers of emissions, excluding purchased offsets. It was the first of its kind in North America, and is considered quite economically sound and is a benchmark for such regulations around the world. Can someone explain to me what proposal would be new in regards to Alberta's carbon tax?"

How they're spinning it is not ""carbon tax bad!"" but rather that it seems Albertans don't understand how a carbon tax works, which I think is probably true. I mean, tax sounds bad. Everyone hates taxes. But on the other hand, people love getting their tax refunds. I don't think people realize how it's supposed to work, and that the give-back part is a fundamental aspect of how any carbon tax scheme should work.  The goal of a carbon tax is not to pry more money out of people's hands, it may have that effect to some small degree, especially at first, but the real goal is to give people a financial reason to start collecting the carbon they're selling/releasing/burning into the atmosphere and putting it back in the ground where it came from. Part of the incentive comes from the penalty of the tax, but the other part of the incentive comes from the rebates those tax dollars go back into.  If Syncrude (arbitrary example) wants to keep digging up oil without offsetting the carbon in it, and is fine to just pay the carbon tax, then that means their taxed cash is available for me if I want to start planting trees or some other method of carbon neutralization.

alberta,37i814,Pharma_John,2,Wed May 27 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"If we implemented the same ""revenue neutral carbon tax"" modeled by BC, it would basically be an added tax at purchase of fuel. Everyone will be targeted, including industry (for fuel combustion). Yes, your uncle who uses fuel will be taxed. There's a good chance that your uncle will get most of his tax returned. There is also a low income tax credit in BC. Our current industry focused strategy of carbon capture and storage reduces about 2.78 million tonnes per year (little considering how much we emit) and the NDP plans on scrapping it."

I'll just create fucking controversies or some other fuckety bullshit out of thin air, connect it with the NDP and everyone one will DEEEEEERRRRRP Holy fuck, I think I caused myself a stroke trying to put myself in your shoes.  Here - read this fucking survey  You know what... I'll make it easier for you and highlight the most important point.  ""The increasing variety of tobacco products available in Canada has made them more attractive to youth. Many of these tobacco products are heavily flavoured. These include little cigars or cigarillos, water pipe tobacco, menthol cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Fruit and candy-flavoured tobacco makes it easier for youth to become addicted. The 2012–2013 YSS reports that there was an increase of in the number of youth using flavoured tobacco products in the past 30 days to 22%, up from 19% in the 2010–2011 YSS. There was also an increase in the number of youth in grades 6–12 using a water pipe to smoke flavoured tobacco in the past 30 days from 13% in 2010–2011 to 17% in the 2012–2013 YSS. These statistics show that there is an urgent need for federal and provincial governments to ban all flavoured tobacco products to protect Canadian youth.""  Now, I know this is actual information and data... and I'm not sure if you can actually understand or handle this. Possibly you don't even know what the fuck it means.  Smoking is one of the most fucking addictive products. Read the case of Sigmund Freud and his addiction to cigars. I'll help you out on this argument. This is something called ""anecdotal."" But I am using it to make a point of how addictive tobacco products are.   The issue is sometimes youth are dumb fucks that don't realize the long-term consequences of their actions. Flavoured cigarettes, including menthol, increase tobacco use by those who are young by a significant number. Despite all actions, it's very difficult to keep tobacco out of the hands of the youth. And early use results in life-long addictions. Do you understand how that works? How in grade six you smoking menthol cigarettes may lead to a life-long decision that you regret?   It doesn't really have an impact on adults that want to take up smoking. But it does have a huge impact on youth, especially those who are too young to smoke and, again I will emphasize this, may need protection as they are vulnerable.  I can provide some links as to the long-term affects of smoking if you want. Heart disease. Cancer. Emphysema.  So that's the fucking case against menthol cigarettes. And no, it's not the biggest problem that the province faces. But it's an easy win that has a significant impact on youth.  See what I did there? I used actual facts. I used an strong anecdotal case to further emphasize my point. I didn't make up shit or pull things out of the air and create hypothetical points to further may case. I also didn't try to place a label on members of the population and put them all under one banner, implying that they all have the same values and behaviours."
alberta,37j883,rippppin,-5,Thu May 28 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"See what I did there? I used actual facts.    You did?  Where?

Okay, I'll try to go back a little further and hopefully you can learn something.  So there are things called ""surveys."" That is where they do a random sampling of people and get them to answer questions.   Now, I know this is a trigger for you. But I'm going to use the word ""government."" Try not to stroke out.  Government conducts these surveys. And these surveys have to meet a number of ""criteria"" before they are considered accurate. For example, they have to survey enough people. One person wouldn't be enough. Two people wouldn't be enough. If I'm going to fast, please let me know.  They also have to survey a random sample. They can't just survey, for example, your family. That wouldn't give accurate enough information.  Then they look at ALL the information that is gathered. The have to look at it all, not just the points they like and don't like. Then they get other people to look at it to make sure it's all correct. Then they publish it. If there is anything in there that is wrong, they get called on it and have to take it down or correct any information that is wrong.  When government conducts a survey, they have to ensure they meet ALL these ""criteria"" or they can't publish it. There's a whole bunch of ""checks and balances"" within government to ensure the validity of the survey.  These are called ""facts."" Not bullshit I pulled out of my ass.  Oh man, that's a lot of big words and a lot of triggers for you, I hope you're okay.  Now I linked to the Canadian Cancer Society webpage, which you likely think are a group of ""overly-emotional liberals?"" It's just that webpage had a good overview of the actual survey conducted. Here's a summary of the survey on the Canadian Government site.  Now, when you replicate the survey...  Sorry. When you do the questions again in simlar way, you get something called a ""trend."" These aren't lies or myths. You know like the shit you make up. And this allows you to compare one year to another to see if things are staying the same or changing.

That statement hasn't undergone a peer review. It's bullshit unless you can provide some data to back it up. The story about Sigmund Freud is a well-documented story about his struggles with tobacco addiction. You can look up his biography and read multiple accounts with many people that say the same thing.   Just because you didn't see it or thought it up doesn't mean that it's not a fact. And if a fact disagrees with your opinion... that doesn't make the fact wrong. It may actually mean your opinion is wrong.  Now, again, you're attacking me. Not the arguments I'm making. Try again. This is good practice for you in other threads. I believe in you /u/TexasNorth."

The fact of the matter is nuclear power can be safe, there are many nuclear plants that have run for a long time without incident.   These two terrible incidents do show how bad it can be if the proper precautions are not taken.  Chernobyl was due to human error.  Fukushima is widely believed to be caused by a natural disaster, but was actually human error also (if you don't believe me research Onagawa which was actually closer to the epicenter of the earthquake/tsunami than Fukushima). If standards were higher it's most likely neither of these incidents would have happened."

It's two sided.  Not only do they want to ban coal, they also wants us using less energy collectively.  Most people only hear the first part of that, and ignore the unsaid but implied second half.

After the first few incidents, like the marijuana photo or complaining about serving tables, even I was defending her as simply being young. But this has gone way past that. Who is still making these mistakes at 25 years old? She should have grown out of this by now, and I don't want to watch her grow out of it in public service.   In any other job she'd be fired.

But I can't help feel feel an air of hypocrisy around this whole incident. If a bunch of journalist were to scour the internet for any dirt on you, few would fair much better. A lot of that info is very hard to get rid of, especially when you don't really control access to it. You might block access to your account, but what about your friends who post untagged pictures of you. Considering that there were people dedicated to digging up all the dirt up on her they could, not much was really found. Yes it was a mistake that they were able to check her Facebook and get pictures of her, but unlike most other politicians, she is young enough to be one of the first politicians with her youth on social media. People like to act all high an mighty but when you were in your 20's, was every reckless thought you had tempered by your concern for a potential future in politics.   Another part of this I find particularly galling is that it seems that a disproportionate amount of time is spent reporting on this story. Now I mostly just read internet news, so I have bias there, but personally I've heard more about this then our former wife beating justice minister. There has been multiple days dedicated to Deborah watch while these photo's are systematically leaked, but in my opinion this is trivial compared to what some of the PC MLA's got away with.   http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/alberta-mla-caught-in-prostitution-sting-welcomed-back-to-pc-caucus-1.1903326 http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/05/04/jonathan-denis-wife-restraining-order_n_7208348.html https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/12/can-d22.html"

alberta,37ccaq,aardvarkious,10,Tue May 26 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, layoffs in most cases would be the initial reaction before price increase. Price increases are not easy. For a business owner a lot of research and costs go into ensuring they raise costs that will still allow them to maintain their current profit levels without over pricing and remaining competitive while still covering the increased costs in wages.   It's much easier to just lay off people initially and allow the new minimum wage and price increases to services to be the new norm. This takes 3-5 years.   Especially for restaurants and retail. Right now I can hire 3 people for ~30 an hour. With the new increase I can hire 2. Now the work they do is easier for 3, but also manageable by 2 people. I know this because we get along with 2 people all the time due to illness, vacations etc. So, I'll just lay one person off, increase the work load of the remaining 2. This is actually good news for the remaining 2, because they see a 50% raise for doing the same work with a slightly increased work load, where they have done so in the past with no extra pay. Usually when lay offs happen because of economic downturns, people get added work loads without wages increasing. In 3 years time when the new wages are the norm and market prices changes have been rolled out and accepted, then I'll go ahead and hire again."
alberta,37ccaq,the_alberta_way,9,Tue May 26 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is you now don't have a third and will be down to one in times of illness vacation etc. You can only squeeze so much productivity out of people, even initially you will either have to reduce service, reduce margins, or increase prices."

alberta,37ccaq,vaguelyswami,2,Tue May 26 21:19:57 2015 UTC,I would agree with that in the short term. Really not sure how inflation plays out with this
alberta,37ccaq,ApoliticalypseNow,9,Wed May 27 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"According to this article, 10% of Albertans make 15 dollars or less an hour(source StatsCan). That's a way lower number than the +20% that that other redditor is posting in the Alberta subreddit.  I wonder if they'll quit posting that 20% number and retract that BS stat? Doubt it seeing as its ideologicly motivated."
alberta,37ccaq,vaguelyswami,18,Tue May 26 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Problem is this doesn't just affect those who make under 15 bucks an hour. I hire some floor staff that make 11 dollars per hour. I also hire a supervisor that makes 16 bucks per hour. Thier work load is a bit more with a fair bit more responsibility and stress. They get paid more as compensation. Now, that floor staff is going to be paid 15. This severely diminishes the wage bonus for my supervisor position. A couple of things happen; my supervisor gets a raise to restore the position incentive wage to $20 plus, or I keep the wage the same and end up having them quit. I then end up with a supervisor position I can't keep staffed because there is no added value to occupying the more strenuous position.  Then I have to think of what to do with my manager who was making $21 dollars an hour..."
alberta,37ccaq,ApoliticalypseNow,6,Tue May 26 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on that cascading effect. I am thinking about what to do with my 7 staff, 1 manager and a driver. Thinking of performance/retention bonuses instead of an hourly wage increase."

alberta,37ccaq,gravityapple,9,Tue May 26 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"Employment level is not based upon wage level but upon the need of a business to have an act of labour to occur to fulfill a demand that creates a profit for the business.  Demand is what drive employment.   Every dollar you can  get to a low wage worker will increase overall demand for services as every dollar  they get has far greater impact to overall economic health, then an extra dollar going to a business owner.  The net increase in demand may actually out way the extra cost in labour and be a gain for business in general.  However there is of course the possibility that this may not be the case for any one particular business.   I may come back later with the research, but I will leave with this.  While we may say that brain and heart and other vital system require blood, so do the extremities.     While of course it is fatal to deprive vital organs of blood, it also good idea to get flow of blood to the extremities because while a beating heart is good for life, so is the ability to hang on for dear life or run away from danger."
alberta,37ccaq,cogedoin,5,Tue May 26 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"If you increase the cost of something, people will usually buy less of it.  Raising the minimum wage increases the cost of labour."

alberta,37ccaq,kevinnetter,2,Tue May 26 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"This is true but it is offset by the fact that the business will have less money to spend.  Unless for some reason you think business are more likely to spend their money outside the jurisdiction than individuals are.  But I don't see why that would be the case in Alberta.  So you end up with no change in economic activity, but businesses hiring fewer workers.  The workers who get jobs make a bit more.  For most businesses this is a small effect.  Those who suffer the most are the marginal workers who get let go and can't find new jobs."

So their solution is to return to a system that causes even worse violence against women?  Shouldn't they be advocating the opposite?  ""Women are pressed into prostitution by male demand rather than by personal choice,"" Nixon said.""  Bizarre logic. That is like saying ""Construction workers pressed into trade by demand for buildings rather than personal choice.""  Both are choosing to fill a demand.

HERE is another article, with an interview with a Calgary sex worker. Some quotes:   Arianna says that in Calgary she’s “never, ever come across an underage person or somebody being forced to work.” She says a small minority of sex workers are being forced, and believes there are ample resources available for those people. For her, sex work is the opposite of degrading.  “It’s my body, what I choose to do with it is what I choose to do,” she says. She lists the positives: overcoming body image issues, being her own boss, business skills and learning about a variety of topics through clients.  “It is a very empowering industry. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.”   Her report matches virtually every interview I've read about sex workers here. I also used to do outreach work with homeless people and sex workers and every single sex worker I ever met was in the business because she enjoyed making so much money. I encouraged them to leave the work, but they simply did not want to. They all had plans of ""retirement"", but the money was so tempting most of them stayed (for as long as I knew them)."

It's an initiative they started last year. Most other police forces would see a comparable amount of missing teens, but not all send out releases every time they go missing.  Red Deer RCMP, and other RCMP detachments, also use the ""missing person"" release to help them locate people who have warrants for their arrests. In the case of people under 18 it allows them to skirt the issue of naming a young offender without getting a court order."

We've gone out of our way to put out every fire over the last 100 years, and all it's done is lead to larger, more intense wildfires!  Do you know why?  Because mother nature needs to renew herself and burn out all of the old chaff so that it can regenerate.  And what do we do?  We put the fire out.   There's so much dead and rotting fuel in these forests now solely because our idiot government has such ""good intentions"" and thinks they can control mother nature."
alberta,378gx6,Dabookitty,15,Mon May 25 21:49:53 2015 UTC,That would be a great idea if we didn't have things like Homes and Towns and infrastructure to protect.  We do not need another Slave Lake incident in this province.  If you want to province to stop fighting fires...then be prepaired for even higher taxes!

There are prescribed burns as well as priorities. Why is Alberta aggressive in fighting fires? Well it's a lot more manageable to put out a 0.1 ha fire then a 30000ha fire that is threatening homes.

alberta,378gx6,chillysword,3,Tue May 26 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a lot of these fires are set by humans.

There's been two fires in my city (Fort McMurray) in the past couple weeks that were caused by humans. It's been really dry and one of the fires was just 3 blocks from my house. Should the fire department have not responded and just let it burn down houses on the greenbelt?  There was a fire down by Red Earth Creek last week that burned over 250 ha because some guy decided to torch his truck in a ditch, is it really controlling mother nature when we started it in the first place?  What about the Slave Lake fire of 2011? RCMP concluded it was arson that started that fire that caused $700 million worth of damage to Slave Lake and burned 4700ha. Should we have just let that fire burn whatever it wanted because mother nature decided a guy lighting a forest fire was what the world needed at that point in time?"

alberta,376yku,ZanThrax,-13,Mon May 25 21:07:50 2015 UTC,The average Canadian has an rrsp. I am not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination (maybe not your imagination) and I have an rrsp. You can get them for as little as $10 a month. Are you telling me the average Canadian is unable to afford 4 less coffees per month? You don't have to be wealthy to get into a fund.

alberta,376yku,Ashlir,3,Mon May 25 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"Having a few hundred or thousand dollars worth of RRSPs is hardly the same thing as having directly bought shares of specific companies, let alone having bought shares of specifically Albertan companies.  No ones RRSP is going to be affected one way or another by the economic policies of the province; even if those policies were to somehow completely collapse a few local companies, the funds that own those shares would be the first ones to divest, and they're massively diversified - by design - so that they won't be greatly impacted by any one company's failure."

After all your premise is that everyone is poor as dirt, and could never afford to help themselves other than a tiny portion of the population.  Mine is that the majority of people in Canada have the means to put $10 dollars a month into a rrsp but not the desire when you can pick someone else's pocket instead.

alberta,376yku,mooky1977,13,Tue May 26 04:06:53 2015 UTC,"The one tactical advantage always held by the right wing is that it is easy (and popular) to lower taxes and always hard to raise them.  So Harper is proud to tell Canadians how he has cut the GST and Corporate tax rates, offered income splitting and tax free savings accounts, at the same time that he has run seven consecutive deficits and watched the debt (which had been shrinking under the Liberals despite higher interest rates) begin to creep upwards. To use the household debt analogy, that's like you taking a lower paying job while buying a bigger house.  At least Klein got rid of Alberta's net debt before slashing tax rates. But now that oil is once again in a bust cycle, his successors are stuck with an unrealistically low corporate tax structure, and our resources are essentially being given away for free. Conservatives like to say the whole problem is government spending, yet the PCs only cut program spending for about four of their 44 years in power (1992-1995 IIRC).  Balancing a budget is just that; finding an appropriate balance between spending which fulfills societal needs and meets the electorate's expectations, against revenue from all sources. And sometimes we have to look at an insufficiency on the revenue side of the ledger. To say, as Brian Jean did in the recent election ""no new taxes, EVER"" removes one half of the government's ability to budget right off the bat. It's like saying we don't really need all those pricey schools and money bleeding hospitals cause, hey, taxes!"
alberta,376yku,DocBrown59,5,Mon May 25 22:29:00 2015 UTC,"Dead on. While it's true that governments can spend poorly (whether through mistakes, corruption, etc), to claim all government spending is wrong is just silly. The WRP and small-governmenters of their ilk make the fundamental error of confusing natural and social structures. That is, they look at something like healthcare or roads, and basically don't realize how much these things existence depends on taxation and spending by governments. Their idea of reducing waste sounds great until you really think about it. A certain amount of waste is unavoidable. I'm reminded of David Mitchell's joke that pledging to eliminate government waste is like saying you'll cut the costs of running a bar by telling everyone to be really, really careful not to break a glass."

On the other side, it's arguable that he partly transferred the provincial debt to municipalities and taxpayers, who found themselves suffering cutbacks in public services (also remember that during this time of prosperity, Albertans were the only Canadians paying healthcare premiums, which begs the question: when the economy is good, who's it good for?)  It's also worth noticing that the period of 2000-2015 saw annual increases in income disparity. The rich got richer and the poor got sicker."

It hurts everybody. If governments had to follow a clear and straightforward set of accounting rules, similar to the way accountants have to follow generally accepted accounting practices, we laypeople might actually have some hope of being able to make an informed decision about our government's policies.

He revved the economy red-hot, then retired before he had to deal with the consequences.  The world of oil production has changed significantly since the crash of 2008 and it's unlikely that Alberta will ever be able to achieve that level of prosperity again.  Something to keep in mind is that 2008/2009 saw the lowering of the prime rate to ridiculously low levels.  This helps mask the backslide Alberta has gone through in the past 5 or 6 years.  Otherwise, house prices would be back around 2004-5 levels."
alberta,376yku,Himser,3,Mon May 25 15:03:35 2015 UTC,Alberta was doing fine from 2010-2014. We're never again going to see an economy like the run up to 2008 but let's not exaggerate and pretend Alberta has been in a backslide for six years.
alberta,376yku,Lawtey,2,Mon May 25 19:49:10 2015 UTC,I wouldnt disagree. However elimination of the debt was the one thing that he did that boosted the Alberta Advantage to higher then anywhere else. When you have an extra 30% per YEAR of government revenue to put into programs or cut taxes (i prefer programs) your instantly at a 30% advantage over anywhere that has debt.
alberta,376yku,Himser,8,Mon May 25 18:17:15 2015 UTC,"It's easy to credit Klein with the success of the province, however, if you have a bit more of a global perspective, you start to wonder how a party with a dynasty of 44 years managed to wind up with us in billions of dollars of debt when they leave, despite Alberta's massive abundance of natural resources."
alberta,376yku,Lawtey,2,Mon May 25 17:40:03 2015 UTC,I agree. But at least at one point we were the only goverment with the for site to not have debt. The only other government to really do that is norway.

There's many things that are zero-rated and exempt from the GST.  Most daily needs are zero rated, such as basic groceries and other food and agricultural/aquacultural products, prescription drugs, medical devices, and a host of other essentials of life. Zero rated (to make a long story short) means that the rate could theoretically be changed administratively (i.e. not requiring a change in legislation) to something non-zero, but in practice this is very rarely done.  Others are outright exempt (i.e. would require a change in law), such as residential rent, the sale of used residential property (everything from houses to apartment buildings), the sale of farmland or vacant land, medical services, education, prepared food sold to students, legal aid, child care, transit passes, and almost everything that charities and most things that non-profits sell.  As an experiment, try keeping track of your GST expenses compared to your total expenditure for a month. You'd be surprised at how far below 5% it actually is."

As for Texnorth and his ideas seem to think that the NDP will sink the province but news for you, it is already sinking.  This is a direct cause from many factors.  No good policy from the PC gov't since 2008 other than catering to corporate and them selves.  Oil will never leave Alberta, the industry is in a state of flux with environmental laws and public knowledge is increasing of the impact they are having on everything.  Big oil only wants to make as much money as possible, if a company can pay a CEO as much as some nations GDP they can pay a small increase on tax.  The province NEEDS to diversify and become less dependant on oil to survive and thrive.  After the PC detroyed Saskatchewan with the Devine era the NDP grew business and diverified.  Coming from Saskatchewan and the whole talk of PST on groceries is crap, you don't pay on them. Most things were cheaper out there and wages were also better than anything in Southern Alberta.  Minimum wage going up will not destroy anything, it has been proven that if the lower income earners have more to spend the more prosperous the society is.  100,000 people who have an extra $50/month will spend more than five people with $1,000,000 ever will.  The wage increase is a trend throughout North America and most places in Saskatchewan are far above minimum where as in Alberta they cling to it and refuse to give raises.  The trend tends to be hire for 89 days and fire to keep from giving benefits.  Low income workers need the additional insurance and can't afford to purchase.  They are the ones who have families and get stuck depending on assistance instead of being able to further themselves."

Anyways, for the past 40 odd years, these boards have obviously been dominated by the PCs and the disappointment in the current boards is clear. The U of A's Faculty union has already asked Notley to rescind their board's chairman. From what I can tell, most facility, student, and support staff unions will pass votes of no confidence in their president, and boards.  So what will change? Well, expect a lot of open positions on various post-secondary boards to be filled by more left-leaning folks, and maybe even some presidents will be replaced. Government has a lot of power in this area because taxpayers front about half  the cost of our public post-secondary schools. Like when the PCs first took power, they created the ministry of Advanced Education and really cetralized things. They also swept a lot of the boards clean of social credit people within their first term; if you look back at the history of these boards, you'll see they all end up with new chairs in '72 or '73.  I also suspect that the new Minister of Advanced Ed, Lori Sigurdson, will follow through on what Mr. Lukaszuk promised 2 years ago: a review of executive pay. It will play nicely with everyone, even fiscal conservatives! A win-win. Unless you run a post-secondary institution in Alberta. Ideally, we'll also start seeing more shared governance, the kind argued for in this conference paper."

The new members have to learn the ropes a bit and the staff need to be directed in possibly new ways. Even if they start something like a royalty review... It'll take a year to finish or so to change much.

These workers will be competing for rental accommodation driving cost of rent up.    The entire supply chain for the products we use everyday is going to experience inflation as companies raise prices to offset increased wage expenses in the balance sheets.

alberta,377y1b,TexasNorth,-10,Mon May 25 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Here's what I legitimately think will happen.   1-2 months from now, she announces a royalty review and the oilpatch crashes even further.  More layoffs, less revenue, etc.  She'll also announce some kind of ""review"" or ""audit"" of what the PC's did during their last 10 years in power.   4-12 months from now, she / they begin to panic about the deepening recession and implement very few new royalties and a very small corporate tax increase, but just enough so that she can say that she ""did something.""  Her ""audit"" will find some minor scandal with the previous PC government and she will use it to deflect attention away from the economy, debt and deficits.   12-16 months from now, the oil patch will begin to pick up and Notley will use the excuse to implement a 1 or 2% PST.  Alberta will still be in a recession from the oil price crash, and this will drive us even further off the cliff.  After having done almost nothing a year from now, her hardcore Socialist supporters will begin to become disenfranchised and scream and cry about her being ""just the same as the PC's"" and begin to demand that she start to make ""real changes.""  She will still be using the excuse that the NDP is still ""cleaning up from the mess that was made by the PC's"" and the idiot general public will forgive her.   16-24 months from now, Alberta will be in a deep recession and the general public will have become totally disenfranchised with her and the NDP party.  We will have a PST, investment in the oil patch will have slowed even further, and we will be running record breaking deficits.  People who moved here from BC, Ontario and Kebec will begin to move back and the Alberta population will begin to shrink for the first time ever.  Alberta will be forced to begin taking transfer payments from Ottawa, but Notley will spin this as a ""good"" thing because free* money.   24-48 months from now, Oil prices will be higher, but not by much.  The ""world recession"" will have ended, but growth in Alberta will be in the tenths of a percentage instead of the 3-5% we are now used to.  Notley will go on the tv and tell the idiot, low-information-voting public about how she, the new PST, and her policies ""pulled the economy out from a deep recession"".  The media and guilty, idiot white Liberals will write articles in the media and go on TV and proclaim that Notley is an economic genius. 48 months from now, Notley will win re-election based on even more promises of spending, ""investment"", and re-distribution.  The people of Alberta will be so beaten down by the last 4 years of recession that they will cry out for someone to ""save them"", and Notley will tell them that she's the only one that can do that, but she ran out of time during her first term to implement everything that she wanted to and will need another 4 years to ""fix all of the problems."""
alberta,377y1b,Windig0,7,Mon May 25 19:24:46 2015 UTC,"I suspect they won't make any big moves until after the federal election so as not to risk hurting the NDP brand.  The royalty stuff might be delayed a year or two since it will cause so much visible harm. If oil prices go up and the economy is rebounding, the review will happen immediately.   The NDP knows over 60% of Albertans didn't vote for them and they know they probably only have 4-years. As such they'll try to implement as many policies that will be politically costly for future governments to reverse. Expand union power, raise corporate taxes, minimum wage, make taxes very progressive, balloon the size of the bureaucracy, sign long-term commitments to refining capacity, eliminate home/private schooling, expand ""environmental protection theatre"" to force the oil industry to hire even more biologists and liberal arts grads, etc.   I hope I'm proven completely wrong and made to eat my words, but I doubt it."

You're actually somewhat correct though...depending on how long this oil glut lasts, we may actually see the population of Alberta decline.  All those people seeking success in the roller coster of the oilpatch will go home, which will actually help stabilize the province as a whole...it will reduce the pressures on government spending on new infrastructure to combat the ""growing population"".  Of course, what you fail to mention, is when oil recovers so will the jobs, and the Alberta economy.  The oilsands have billions and billions of investment, and when it makes sense to ramp up production they will...regardless of the royalty review which the oilpach has already said they're not against and want to be a part of.

The question is, should there be protections in place for those that may not know the implications of working for free?   Many businesses will do whatever they can to cut corners. To put the blame on the employee may not be the best system.  If a business has unsafe practices, is it the fault of the employee for not knowing it's unsafe?  How about someone who falls for a pyramid or Ponzi scheme?  Why should the Better Business Bureau exist? Isn't it the responsibility of the consumer to know and understand a company before purchasing an item?  Unpaid internships may have their place. But I'm not sure it is best practices to allow industry to set the standards. Industry does not have a good track record in establishing standards."

I do think the cabinet is a little small, though. 15 or 16 would have been better, IMO. They might grow the cabinet after this first session though. They will not be bringing a full budget in until the fall and I wouldn't be surprises if there is a cabinet shuffle then. There may be some people Notley wants in cabinet who are experienced professionals, but don't yet have the legislative experience and political acumen to be ministers. This short session starting in June might be training camp and try-out for a few current backbenchers."
alberta,374nzt,mo60000,3,Mon May 25 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"I am super confused on a few things:   Official Alberta.ca website says we still have a Minister of ESRD, a Minister of Parks and Recreation, and a Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development.   Meanwhile, the media is using different names, such as ""Environment and Parks,"" ""Forestry,"" and they haven't reported on a Sustainable Resource Development ministry as far as I know. Culture and Tourism's website also lists Shannon Phillips as the Minister of Parks and Recreations (as well as Minister of ESRD).   Right now it seems like official government documentation is using different names than what was reported by the media, and it seems really unclear as to what has happened to ESRD."
alberta,374nzt,xrendan,2,Mon May 25 00:56:54 2015 UTC,I believe Shannon Phillips will be over ESRD.   The government likely shortened the Minister titles to make it less cumbersome to say.
alberta,374nzt,mo60000,3,Mon May 25 17:50:51 2015 UTC,So it looks like the speaker will be chosen sometime in early June when the legislature opens up again(I don't remember the exact date the legislature opens up again). I wasn't expecting some of the people Notley choose for her cabinet to have certain positions. Edit:I am now hearing that someone accidentally leaked who was nominated for the position by the NDP  before the vote took place.So it looks like that person will definitely win most likely now.

alberta,374nzt,mo60000,2,Mon May 25 09:35:34 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you for certain, but I would guess that no they didn't break any legislature rules, however they may have broken tradition.   What I can tell you is how the process for choosing the speaker works: on the first day of session all of the MLA's meet in the chamber and the first thing they do is elect a speaker. Now to become eligible to receive speakership you must first be nominated by another MLA, then you (if you would like) can decline the nomination or you can accept it. This happens until no one else is nominated. And now the vote occurs. The vote is similar to how you vote during an election. The pages circulate a box where each MLA puts their vote and the clerk (I think) then tags then aloud and counts them. Finally the new speaker is robbed by the speaker's page."
alberta,374nzt,john885497,1 point,Mon May 25 12:46:04 2015 UTC,"They are not breaking rules. A few conservatives and Rosers on Twitter are trying to make a stink about it because the NDP announced (nothing was leaker) that Wanner will be their ""nominee"" for Speaker. The Alberta (PC, really) tradition is that that there are no official government nominees for Speaker (unofficially, that, of course, is a different story) and people just stand for election by the Assembly. In other provinces, there weren't/aren't even elections and the Speaker was appointed by the Premier.   The NDP seem to be taking a middle of the road approach, which seems fair. PC partisans can crow that their process was more ""open"" (really, its more secretive because voters don't get to know which candidate for speaker their party supported), but the reality is they had the luxury of not having to nominate a candidate and have less party-line votes because they enjoyed supermajorities in the Assembly. Governing parties in other provinces and the AB NDP can't be so casual with the Speaker voter because if a bunch of their caucus vote for someone else, their votes, combined with those of the opposition, could elect a Speaker from another party."

alberta,376fnw,JustAddRenin,7,Mon May 25 07:06:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't knock Kamloops, that lake is pretty nice. It's probably a stretch to get to from Kamloops, but B.C. has Wells Gray Provincial Park that is pretty spectacular.  If you're going to Golden then you'll probably want to check out either Wapta Falls or Takakkaw Falls in Yoho National Park.  Along the Icefields Parkway there's a couple of pretty scenic spots to stop at:   Peyto Lake, there's a small hike up to the observation area, well worth the stop, it will be very crowded most likely. Probably about 30-45 minutes of your time. Mistaya Canyon, haven't been there yet myself but I'm told it's quite nice Icefields Centre / Athabasca Glacier, you can take a tour bus out onto the glacier, or park in the lower parking lot and walk up onto it yourself. Super windy, and (un)surprisingly cold. You can also take a bus to the Glacier Skywalk, which is like 5 minutes away, you can't stop and get out yourself, gotta do the whole bus. The scenery isn't the greatest where they put the skywalk, so it's mostly going for the sake of going on the skywalk. Tangle Falls is a bit past the Skywalk, small parking lot, worth stopping, you can climb up to the higher falls if you'd like, paths on both sides Beauty Creek, there's an unmarked turnout after you've come down from Tangle Falls, some really spectacular waterfalls. Pretty easy hike, maybe about an hour to get to Stanley Falls and back. Sunwapta Falls, well marked, worth a stop Athabasca Falls, also well marked, you can also take the road to Jasper in a roundabout fashion, lots of nice scenery on that road too. It's not open but that road would take you up to Mount Edith Cavell / Cavell Pond / Cavell Glacier Horseshoe Lake is pretty nice, people will be cliff diving there if the weather is warm enough Valley of the Five Lakes is a nice hike if you've got an afternoon to spare, there's a loop you can do As you get closer to Jasper there's the old highway that you can take, it'll take you along the Athabasca River and it's also the way to Old Fort Point should you decide to go there (Bighorn Sheep hang out up there) Bow Valley Parkway between Lake Louise and Banff. In your case you'd be driving it from Lake Louise to Banff, so take the road towards Mount Norquay and hang a right, it's well marked.   Jasper:   I'm partial to the Tekarra Dining Room if you're looking for a great (albeit expensive) meal You'll want to drive up to Pyramid Lake, there's a small island you can walk on to, very tranquil. There's also a resort and a fairly decent restaurant in The Pines You can go out to Jasper Park Lodge and just walk around, you can walk around Lac Beauvert or if you turn left before JPL you can walk around Lake Annette both of which are quite nice. Old Fort Point is a nice little hike, gets you a view of Jasper Park Lodge / Jasper Townsite Whistler Skytram is also worth checking out, it's pretty chilly at the top though Maligne Canyon, make sure you start over by the teahouse as if you're not careful you'll miss the biggest waterfall there Maligne Lake, you can take a boat tour over to Spirit Island which is really quite beautiful. There's also a short loop hike that you can do, not the most scenic after you start heading away from the lake, but you get to see some nifty glacier related scenery. Miette Hot Springs are about halfway between Jasper and Hinton, a beautiful twisty road up to the top. There's a small set of falls shortly after you get on the road called Punchbowl Falls, worth getting out for. You can walk up to the old hot springs and go see the old source if you walk down the path near the end of the parking lot. At the bottom of the Miette road there's the remains of an old mining town, with an interpretive trail, you can also walk up to Punchbowl Falls if you're so inclined Earls and Famosos are pretty good for chain restaurants, The Raven Bistro and Evil Dave's are definitely worth checking out. The Downstream is hit or miss for me, but they've got an extensive drink collection.   Lake Louise:   Moraine Lake is on the road up to Lake Louise, definitely check that out Lake Louise and Chateau Lake Louise are probably on your list, there's a trail at Lake Louise that you can check out When you head to Banff, make sure you take the Bow Valley Parkway Johnston Canyon, this will be super popular and you might not be able to park in the public parking lot, there's a really neat trail that takes you to a pretty nice waterfall, you can go further to another set of waterfalls and ink pots if you keep going beyond that   Banff:   Cave & Basin is worth checking out Banff Gondola, in theory you can hike up to the top of the Gondola and get a ride down free, but your mileage might vary on that, it will be super crowded Banff Hot Springs Banff Springs Hotel, yet another Fairmont property, you can walk around the grounds / hotel and take it in. The Bow Falls are located nearby so it's worth checking out when you do that Lake Minnewanka, there's a really nice drive up to the lake, you can go in either direction (there's a loop). There's a nice little hike you can take to a canyon with an impressive bridge built over it. There's also a boat tour here as well.   https://www.flickr.com/photos/raruler/ has a bunch of my photos from  Jasper/Banff and places in between, most of the recent ones have GPS locations if you're looking for nice scenery"

alberta,375idw,nheddie,7,Mon May 25 01:35:43 2015 UTC,My guess is they picked someone completely outside of the energy sector to try and shake things up.   Some of the cabinet positions were a bit shocking. McCuaig-Boyd's credentials make it sound like she would have been great for Minister of Advanced Education.
alberta,375idw,physicist88,2,Mon May 25 01:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing a few considerations led to her appointment. First, you're right that she might well have made a good Minister of Advanced Education, or even just covered the Education portfolio. I think those two positions are basically covered by experienced candidates in Sigurdson and Eggen (respectively).  I'm guessing they wanted to get someone from outside Edmonton to cover energy--the optics are better. They also wanted to have a gender-balanced cabinet, so that probably played into the decision (though how much it specifically played into McCuaig-Boyd's appointment is unclear).  At any rate, her work in consulting combined with her education in administration seems to make her a good fit for a position that requires a lot of coordination of parties with competing interests."

The comparisons between Notley's NDP and Lougheed, a member of the Lougheed government writing about his enthusiasm for the new NDP government.  Federally, conservatism adjusted by inter party competition, a merger, and a whole new Conservative Party of Canada forming. In Alberta, the significant changes in ideology were merely shifts within the same organization. As it was uninterrupted, that inconsistency was, I believe, a large contributor to the weakenss of the PCs by the end. Specifically their inability to find a leader from within their own ranks that could unite them post-Klein (who had like Prentice also been an outsider)."

alberta,373stv,OhthatChris,3,Sun May 24 17:41:39 2015 UTC,"Eek.   You're pretty much talking to me.  $690 000 mortgage on 5% down, 2.25 acres and a house with a built in shop.  BUT it's on an individual basis.   This is the home I wanted to be in, I didn't want a townhouse, I didn't want a lane home, matchbox condo or something with asshole neighbors and Harley Davidsons.   I appreciate where i'm living (or will be when I move in shortly as i've just purchased.).  Now for the stability part of it.    I'm not an oil worker, i'm not an alcoholic/druggy tradesperson with the minimal training and work ethic of a 4 year old thats already gotten their cookie.  I am a Red Seal Journeyman Autobody Tech, I hold 4 tickets, i-Car Platinum training and Aluminum repair training certificates.   I'm not on the flat rate system so their will never be any spikes in pay or drops.    My salary is extremely stable and so is the work, even if we hit a bit of a depression people will still be required to have car insurance and i'll still have to fix that kind of work.    Fleet is very busy as well as rental car repairs.   If the oil industry collapses and Alberta goes into different sectors i'll still be okay financially.  Perks of the house.   I'm a journeyman tech who now has a shop large enough to fit 6 cars in.   I'm going to build stuff/fix stuff, keep my home costs down by getting a broken lawn tractor or plow and fixing it ect.   I'm not lazy, i'm not wasting my life but i'm eager to do more for myself.

alberta,373stv,FuguCola,3,Sun May 24 20:12:10 2015 UTC,I have a leg up on this though.    I don't plan on moving again and can get past the upgrade in 5 years stage.   This is the final home for us.   It is such a relief knowing we won't have tfind a buyer amd a real estate agent to make this move if we went small to begin with
alberta,373stv,FuguCola,3,Sun May 24 22:28:27 2015 UTC,Right now even at 25 year amortization you pay more principal the. Interest. So they are putting more of the payment to the house then generations before them did at 6-8%.
alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,2,Sun May 24 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"I hope you were sincere:) and even if you weren't. I will answer the question for you.  He bought an acreage for 726.3k and put down 36k.   He has a mortgage of 690k + premium for CMHC of 21,728.70.  Two scenarios:  1: fixed so about 2.74% His payments are:  3274  His Interest for the Term will be:  89,989.44  His principal paid will be: 106450.56  That is a non Trivial Amount.  Lets Say he was on a variable rate of 2.05% and it stays low for 3 more years.  His payment:  $3,031.03        His Interest will be:  $41,596.59       His Principal Paid will be:  67520.49  Even if rates climb and he pays more to interest then equity he is still paying a fair amount towards the principal of the loan. This seems like alot of money, but maybe they took loans out on her education. Once she starts working they can pay those off.  But to say after 5 years they wont have anything is crazy. Especially if they plan on staying in this house for a while."
alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,1 point,Mon May 25 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"With saying this...  a $400000 home would see between 20-40 000 in real estate fee's if we couldn't do a private deal.   Throwing that money away after 5 years seems absurd when we could just keep paying on the interest and enjoy one home right from the start.  Have you seen the state of all the new neighborhoods with houses at that price range.    Lifted trucks on car filled roads with no where to park.    I'll tell you , i'm all for the peace and quiet of an acreage just and hop out of town."
alberta,373stv,FuguCola,1 point,Mon May 25 01:01:41 2015 UTC,You are not paying those fees the Seller is but what it does give you is the ability to negotiate the price more aggressively than if a realtor is involved. However realtors should be willing to cut fees to help make the deal work.  I agree whole heartedly with the newer developments but at that price point there are plenty of gems to be found but likely not with that 6 car shop you obviously wanted;)
alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,1 point,Mon May 25 02:47:34 2015 UTC,the cmhc website has a premium calculator that will give you the premium for different scenarios. Then added that amount to the mortgage amount he stated.   The thing with the low interest rate is that the payments are so much lower then with 4% we have seen previously. You would have equal interest to principal at 20 year amortization. Now we can get an even better ratio at 25 years. That is why interest rate is driving prices up so much.   you have to realize as well if he uses the home for income at all a portion of that interest is deductible. his income would have to be high in order for the lenders to finance the purchase.   Doctors can buy homes and property with very little down due to their income potential.   That 36 k down payment would be a 20% down on a 180k property.   It would be 10% for a 360k property but there would be a cmhc premium.   The secarnio  you point out is the traditional route for home ownership and fugu is an exception. Just like a person who puts down 20% on first home is.
alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,2,Mon May 25 03:32:39 2015 UTC,"So we did a few things...   We bought privately and avoided a realtor, we paid our land taxes cash so we don't pay monthly on them and paid our lawyers fee's in cash as well.  Interest rate through a broker was even lower.  2.69% is what we got in at!"
alberta,373stv,FuguCola,2,Mon May 25 03:51:16 2015 UTC,Great on finding a property that fits your needs on your own and lucky to who you bought it from. Although you would have been better off getting those fees included jn the mortgage and potentially reinvesting the cash at a higher rate of return or towards your RRSP. Awesome rate too :)   Hope you love your place.
alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,2,Mon May 25 16:25:24 2015 UTC,Yes.   We bought the house 90% based on my current income.
alberta,373stv,FuguCola,1 point,Mon May 25 05:21:33 2015 UTC,Honestly your points are 100% correct and I agree with. For the most part home ownership can be seen as a forced savings vehicle that people can use. Also if you pay rent you are paying someone else's mortgage especially in newer buildings.
alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,2,Mon May 25 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"If I buy a 500,000 house and have at least one roommate paying rent based on normal rental rates in Edmonton, I will decrease my monthly payment for rent while at the same time having any bit of principal payment going into equity.   I make 75k, and with Rent as high as it is in Edmonton, I still have trouble building a savings account big enough to have a large down payment to make.  I could have opted to not drive, and maybe I don't need some of the things I have, but the fact remains that rent in a problem in Alberta, and if you can stop renting, you're probably going to be better off, in the long run."
alberta,373stv,OPsEvilTwin_S_,1 point,Mon May 25 05:24:40 2015 UTC,Owning a house is basically forced savings. Renting you are paying someone elses mortgage. Regardless of having a roommate or not every bit of principal you pay goes to equity. What having the roommate does is allow you to either go with a higher amortization. IE pay it off quicker or it allows you to make additional payments directly towards the principal (This is what I think you meant.)  Be careful though some mortgages do not allow for principal repayment of any significant amount. A minimal down payment on that 500k house at your income would need to be around 100k-120k for the lenders in my experience.   If you were to go a little lower price point the lenders would be willing to see less of a down payment. Perhaps buy something closer to work and walk save that extra money. There are lots of great homes between 250-350k you just have to open minded. These would require a down payment of around 12.5k-17.5k some mortgage broker would be willing to borrow the downpayment to you as well if you income covers it. Be aware of the CMHC insurance costs however.  Your idea is the right one though. Room mates can offset almost the entire cost of ownership with a caveat you do not enjoy your home to yourself anymore and they treat you like a slave a bit:) The joys of owning a home.

alberta,373stv,EdmRealtor,1 point,Mon May 25 16:25:59 2015 UTC,CMHC is to protect the lender not the borrower. The lender will not provide the monies for the home without this assurance.  This is one of the sad realities of home ownership that people are blind to and do not realize.

The multiple misleading strawman arguments about wages in healthcare and education vs. total costs relative to outcome qualities(look at the U.S. of A for all the proof you need to show how wages are not related to total costs of education and healthcare and outcome quality).  If we keep kicking the public servants in their collective salary/pension nads, they will suck it up and provide the same level of service. Yeah, like thats real  human nature. The Fraser is a bought and paid for institution that spews what its told to by its donors and sponsors. Their research is not remotely robust, nor is it objective. CD Howe is better."
alberta,371b13,ApoliticalypseNow,9,Tue May 26 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"The more public sector workers have to deal with journalists, pundits, and Fraser Institute-types saying they are overpaid, the more they will turn to their unions for protection, and the more powerful unions will become.  So this article is counter-productive to this guy's aims, in my opinion.  Even if government workers are overpaid relative to the private sector (which is a dubious claim), they have to deal with wage freezes, the threat of layoffs for political rather than practical reasons, a hiring freeze every five years, and whenever some ass-hat political appointee at Alberta Health Services claims thousands of dollars in expenses for his Mercedes and booze soaked lunches, the government will respond by auditing your $28 expense claim in a b.s. political gesture to assure the public that they're tightening down on public sector excess.    Public sector workers put up with a lot of shit, and the trade-off is they get a comfortable middle-class salary and job security.  Articles like this seem to imply all public employees are political appointees, earning $200,000 a year.  The reality is they are middle-class people who took a job in their field.  They're your neighbours, friends, and family members.    I consider myself to be a fiscal-conservative, and I feel the disrespect the public sector gets needs to stop."

One of the dirty secrets of the US' financial success is that they have a massive government, and a massive quantity of civil servants, on top of their endless debt-spending.  While they encourage European nations to enact austerity measures, they just spend their way out of every financial problem, and their economy is better for it.  It's no mistake that the dominant school of economics is the neo-classical (aka. mostly Keynesian) school, and not the various schools that right-wingers ascribe to...    But the author is actually a finance/economics student, which means he's a finance student that's taken a few junior economics courses (maybe one senior level course), and he's probably trying to build up some right-wing street cred to get into a job on Bay Street.

alberta,372jfe,df52,-2,Sun May 24 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"Unions create at least two problems. Unions are, at their core, a beggar-thy-neighbour enterprise, where-by one persons gain must necessarily be someone else's loss. This is never the intent of union organizers, but it is always the outcome, and intent is, after all, irrelevant. The second problem is they send a false signal to the market, that is they signal, via the higher wage, that there is a shortage of labour in the unionized industry, and so cause people to misdirect their efforts into an industry for which there is no particular demand. Unions will usually justify their existence with the fallacious assertion that ""labour creates wealth"", or its close cousin "" unions created the middle class"" Both assertions are post-hoc fallacies, and as such there is no good reason to believe they are true."
alberta,372jfe,df52,2,Sun May 24 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"It isn't all about money. Unions protect standard of living in general and their weakening is leading to labour abuse on the railway for one.  That said after the bosses the unions are your biggest enemy on the job, so win some lose some."
alberta,372jfe,df52,0,Sun May 24 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"""Unions protect standard of living in general"" This is the post-hoc fallacy that I mentioned: the third problem with unions is that they put downward pressure on wages across all industry except the niche industry that happens to be unionized. This is directly related to the fact that unions are a beggar-thy-neighbour enterprise as I mentioned earlier.This post-hoc-fallacy arises from people not understanding what it is that puts upward pressure on wages."

This may well be true, and for the sake of argument lets say it is, but it's only trivialy true, which is to say people don't ascribe much value to it. We can recognize this by emigration patterns: it's not unusual for people to move from low-wage jurisdictions to high wage jurisdictions, to see the opposite would strike most people as odd. The reason for this is that most people ascribe a higher value to a higher wage, and a lower value to a lower wage: they 'vote with their feet'  in other words."

alberta,372jfe,TexasNorth,2,Tue May 26 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"In fact, unions raise the standard of living. Employers in non-union workplaces have to raise wages to match union wages and conditions, otherwise their best workers will move to union shops or will organize their own workplaces.  Unions are simply a collective of workers selling their labour to an employer. In any capitalist society, I have a right to sell what I can and to try to set my price for that. Unionized workers are smart enough to tell employers, ""if you want to buy our labour, here's our price"". It's the capitalist ideal.  The alternative, as seen in so-called ""right to work"" states in the US, are severely underpaid non-union workers in businesses like McDonald's and Wal-Mart, where full-time workers are so severely underpaid that they need government assistance to live."
alberta,372jfe,Skandranonsg,2,Sun May 24 15:41:56 2015 UTC,""" It's the capitalist ideal"" It's most likely the opposite of the capitalist ideal, since unions are a form of cartelization, and the cap. ideal is a  market free of cartels, hence 'free- market capitalism'. ""non-union workplaces have to raise wages to match union ..."" This is true only if every industry in a jurisdiction is the same: all industry produces widgets for instance. Of course this is impossible, since the creation of one industry necessarily creates a second, different industry. From the point of view of the non unionized industry, the presence of unions puts downward pressure on their wages, an obvious example would be through higher rent and housing costs. If the higher rent & housing costs only applied to union members there wouldn't be a problem, but they don't,so there is. """"right to work"" states in the US, are severely underpaid.."" This isn't the case at all. You may spend some time researching Tennessee and South Carolina to see the millions of dollars the auto industry is investing there and the thousands of people who are employed in the auto industry there, and then compare that to the level of investment and employment in the heavily unionized auto industry in Ontario. here's a good place to start. . http://app.tmxmoney.com/news/cpnews/article?locale=EN&newsid=f26004&mobile=false"

What they need is an effort to keep oil from spilling, and a fast and effective way to make sure it gets cleaned up without any posturing.  We also need a decent plan for getting oilsands tailings properly treated.  But hey, that all sounds complicated and verbally draining.  Instead let's pay a tax."
alberta,36yipf,CadPatMatt,2,Sat May 23 14:16:45 2015 UTC,But only THIS tax. They were pretty clear that carbon tax should offset any possible corporate tax increase.   They also made it pretty clear we should all be paying said carbon tax.
alberta,36yipf,SkogginsThePartisan,5,Sun May 24 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"Alberta already has carbon pricing. Dirty reputations are in the minds of some beholders but Total Revenue=Sales x Price.  Total Revenue of a company is what drives its share value which, in turn, determines investment ease.  Suncor CEO Steve Williams cannot influence let alone control the world oil price but he can suggest that Albertans who trigger all those dirty things that burning  carbon produces pay their fair share.  Understand that the tree huggers who just elected the NDP do not understand ‘fair share’.  Their preferred solution is to blame the job producers. By the way, the price of oil has begun to track upward. Suncor and Cenovus, want to pay for what they emit at the same rate as those (Albertans with the hem-engined half tons) pay for what they emit.  What’s not fair about that? What I like about the idea is if we get the revenue we need to implement NDP environmental policies by lowering the break even point for oilsands (in particular) and conventional oil and gas too.  The breakeven price is what we the owners of the resource want is our fair share of the profit which is Total Revenue – The Breakeven price (all costs including taxes and royalties incurred by the producers). The special magic in this is that people in Ontario who gave us the third finger salute when Justin’s daddy Pierre extracted billions in tax via the National Energy Program and the Americans more recently have much larger populations and our royalties will be tucked in every barrel they buy. Another important point is that Jim Dinning who led on first ballot in 2006 before Steady Eddy ended up winning now believes a fair carbon tax is a good idea.  The policy in place is the one that made the industry pay more for their emissions than we, the people, had to pay.  Premier Stelmach was the guy who did this awful thing because he had promised to during a party election, not a General Election. So the NDP can a) reject an improvement on the PC policy b) come up with a plan that is even better.  Which one of the recently elected kids do you like for that job? Under the old ‘bad’ unfair PC policy Alberta law requires large industrial companies to reduce their energy intensity by 12 per cent a year. Companies that miss the target have to pay $15 a tonne into a technology fund."

Fracking is farm-by-farm, acreage-by-acreage property invasion. Much of it is done in the acreage belt around cities and towns. This time, industry is not just battling farmers or “radical environmentalists”; it is in conflict with people who often purchased rural property with proceeds from careers in the oil industry—the kind of middle class Albertans who put the PCs in office. Real estate studies show that fracking on or near your land can reduce sale value by as much as 25 per cent. Income studies show that most Canadians hold their retirement savings in real estate.

alberta,36wh7j,mylastbreath,6,Fri May 22 19:08:02 2015 UTC,Lesson learned for both.   I wish I had your faith in humanity.
alberta,36wh7j,muskegthemoose,-4,Fri May 22 19:09:23 2015 UTC,Just more evidence of a party that is in no way shape or form prepared to govern the province.

alberta,36wh7j,Killer-Barbie,0,Fri May 22 19:53:14 2015 UTC,Some of the weight has to fall on the board. Why didn't they vet her properly?
alberta,36wh7j,physicist88,3,Sat May 23 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"My guess is they just wanted a name on the ballot and didn't expect her to win (it is a heavily Conservative riding), so they didn't really do much background checking into the candidate.  You can be damn sure that won't be the case in the next election, though. You can call it the Drever precedent.   [EDIT] It somewhat reminds me of Ruth Ellen Brosseau in Quebec from the 2011 federal election. She just put her name on the ballot (not expecting to win), and she was in Vegas when they called her telling her she won that riding."

alberta,36wh7j,themanwhoknowsnothin,2,Sat May 23 19:54:30 2015 UTC,If anything Thomas Dang makes me like the NDP more. He says the right things and doesn't do stupid shit. That's politics 101 right there.

Obviously this warrants an apology and some action since she's now in the public sphere, but isn't this still trying a bit hard to ruin her political career?"
alberta,36wh7j,silent_h,10,Fri May 22 21:40:25 2015 UTC,"For me this crosses the line. She's way too immature to represent herself, let alone anyone else."

I just wish that if there was going to be fallback from this, at least there could be a real public discussion about what makes this type of behaviour unacceptable (for anyone) and how she can make up for it (even outside of a political career).

Folks have to learn how to lead and represent, but we don't ever really get to see the learning process."
alberta,36wh7j,Loire55,14,Fri May 22 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is she's 26 and she's scribbling ""Gay boys"" and stupid shit like this and publicly posting it?  I know a lot of people like to say ""Well I did stupid shit too when I was a kid"", but the fact is she's not supposed to be a kid anymore. I got my act together real quick at 20. Most people I know straightened up into "" adults"" by 22-23 at the latest.   As far as I can tell she was already a candidate by the time she posted this image! Growing into leadership and growing into adulthood are not simultaneous and MLA's are not supposed to be growing into adulthood on the job.  MLA's don't need to be robots, nobody wants that, but 26 year old children aren't really good options either."

alberta,36wh7j,mcfg,2,Fri May 22 19:34:56 2015 UTC,This happened while she was representing the NDP. Indiscretions before could be forgiven but when you do this on election day then its time to take a timeout from the party. Also this photo is a bigoted attack on others.

alberta,36wh7j,Ruleof2,6,Fri May 22 19:51:45 2015 UTC,"One thing that we can be sure of, the NDP sure does suck at vetting people. I guarantee you PC loyalists are digging around every other elected NDPers social media to find more dirt."
alberta,36wh7j,Ironhorn,11,Fri May 22 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"I hate to defend the NDP, but I really don't think the NDP had the resources to do proper vetting at the beginning of the election cycle and was probably still working from the idea of using paper candidates to fill up their slate with no intention of these people winning. I'm not surprised some crazy worked through the cracks, it's understandable. I'm just glad Notley has finally suspended her."

alberta,36wh7j,mcfg,2,Fri May 22 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"So to be clear, we're not talking about how she acts, were talking about how she acted year(s) ago.  Downvotes? We are. I'm not defending her, but she's not in trouble for doing this stuff now, this stuff is all from her past. You can't say    Not how anyone in the public eye... should act.   Because she's not acting that way in the public eye, she acted that way before she knew shed ever run for office, and is only getting in trouble for it now that she is"
alberta,36wh7j,Ruleof2,3,Fri May 22 19:07:39 2015 UTC,Good. Her last social media post related to this controversy definitely crossed the line. I did not care about her other controversial social media posts. Let's hope she learns her lesson and is able to come back stronger as an NDP MLA.

alberta,36wh7j,IcarusOnReddit,6,Fri May 22 19:44:28 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, she was elected in the same riding that last elected Rob Anders, so they currently have Rob Anders as their MP and Miss Drever as their MLA.  Maybe at some point its not the candidate we should look at, but rather the people casting ballots?"
alberta,36wh7j,Ruleof2,4,Fri May 22 18:46:09 2015 UTC,"Well the reason she won was because the Conservative vote was so split, theres no other way any other party could win in that riding (she had about ~30%). And thats the same reason that Rob Anders always wins, without a Conservative split the Conservatives with always win there. Luckily Rob Anders has been replaced for the next election by another PC."
alberta,36wh7j,IcarusOnReddit,3,Fri May 22 20:07:19 2015 UTC,If you really think the vote was split make sure to hold the NDP to the promise of election reform.  I recommend single transferable vote.  I think its silly though that people just add the PC vote to Wildrose or vice versa to argue who should win. A lot of PC second choice would be NDP.
alberta,36wh7j,WillieConway,2,Fri May 22 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"I would've put PC as my second choice if we used that system.

I think we should use instant runoff voting also know as preferential voting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjLhI8UAaM http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting I think preferential voting is best. Not single transferable vote as I said earlier, but its okay too.  Calgary Bow results: http://results.elections.ab.ca/04.htm NDP 34% Lib 4% WRP 23% AP 3% PC 33% GPA 3%  Under PV votes get transfered by ranking. GPA Would all go to NDP by second choice. AP goes ~1/2 to LIBs, 1/2 to PC. The lowest gets eliminated but after those rounds it would look like:  NDP 37% LIB 6% PC 34% WRP 23%  LIB would likely go 3/4 NDP 1/4 PC  NDP 41% PC 35% WRP 23%  WRP gets knocked out because last and votes transfer 3/4 WRP goes PC because right wingness and 1/4 goes to NDP because of government protest 17% to PC and 6% to NDP  NDP 47% PC 52%  PC would have got the riding with instant runoff, but the split isn't huge.

alberta,36wh7j,Ironhorn,1 point,Sat May 23 02:25:25 2015 UTC,You really think 1/4 of the WR voters would put NDP 2nd? Anyone willing to put WR would never put NDP as their next choice.

Generally, if a voter was just angry with PC mismanagement they may not care as much about right-left ideology. Most of the issues in the election were about mismanagement anyway.  http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/the-top-10-issues-facing-albertans-in-the-election-campaign  I am not saying its the most common scenario. 1/4 WRP to NDP is a weird product of dropping the ball so bad, the screw up transcends ideology.

alberta,36wh7j,TexasNorth,1 point,Fri May 22 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"The NDP made a deliberate choice to run a full slate, in order to allow them to be able to present themselves as a true alternative to the PCs. No other party did this. This meant they absolutely had to have a candidate in every riding, and they didn't have enough time to vet or interested individuals to ensure quality in each riding. No different than what happened in Quebec, we end up with parachute candidates who only took the slot because they thought it might somehow pad their resume - few of them expected to be elected when they initially took the candidacy. This was Prentice's election to lose.  Less ridings in Alberta would reduce costs and increase candidate quality."

alberta,36yicm,Oldcrrraig,3,Sat May 23 04:48:16 2015 UTC,"Lake Louise is not far from Banff, and it's gorgeous. If you make the road trip, it's worth doing the full circuit of hitting the Coumbia Icefield (glacier) and Jasper, the less famous but, in my opinion, better cousin city of Banff. The total drive takes about three hours. Being a sweater if you go to the glacier--it is cold there even one hot day.   I'd look up some hikes in Banff. There are a lot of websites, but they range in difficulty and length from a couple hours over mainly flat land to multi-day, mountain treks.  Also try to hit up the hot springs. I'd suggest going at dusk--the cool air and the hot water are a glorious combination.   Food wise you can't really go wrong, but be prepared to spend money. Restaurants aren't cheap.   This might be more vague than you were hoping for, but they're the activities I most enjoy when I'm in the area.   Where are you coming from? Knowing that might help recommending a little easier."

alberta,36yicm,ScallopedYam,3,Sat May 23 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"In Banff:   Definitely go check out the Cave & Basin, it's a neat little walk and the cave is pretty cool. Might be crowded though. Lake Minnewanka and the drive up there is quite nice, you can take a boat tour if you're so inclined. The drive up is a loop so you can go in either direction. Wandering around the Fairmont Banff Springs is kinda nice, it's a bit of a trek to get over there from the town. Good place to have a fancy dinner or brunch depending on your needs/wants. Bow Falls are also a short walk away from the hotel.  The Banff gondola is pretty neat, you can either ride it up and down or decide to hike up or down. Depending on the whims of the people running it, hiking up and riding down is free, but don't count on it. Someone already mentioned the hot springs.   Elsewhere, if you have a car:   If you decide to go to Lake Louise (or Jasper) there's the old highway called the Bow Valley Parkway that takes you from Banff to Lake Louise, it's a slower drive but you'll get to see some really amazing scenery and it's worth stopping at Johnston Canyon.  Lake Louise, the Chateau Lake Louise is also worth checking out and it's right on Lake Louise.  Moraine Lake is pretty popular as well, near Lake Louise. You can do a 'via Verrata' hike up Mount Norquay (near Lake Louise) http://summer.banffnorquay.com   Icefields Parkway:   This takes you from Lake Louise up to Jasper, it's easily my favourite drive. You can stop by the Athabasca Glacier and check that out. Tangle Creek Falls, just off the road after you've past the Brewster Skywalk or whatever they call it. Small parking lot, impossible to miss. Beauty Creek, this is a small turnout has has no signs, but it leads up to a great set of waterfalls, maybe like ~20-30 minutes of easy hiking. Sunwapta Falls, just a small walk down from the parking lot, lots of signs for this one. Athabasca Falls, about ~15 minutes outside of Jasper, huge falls, little walk down. Edith Cavell is unfortunately closed at the moment, otherwise I'd recommend going up there. If you've gone all the way to Jasper, Maligne Lake is pretty amazing too. You can take a boat tour of this, and it'll take you to Spirit Island which is pretty much the postcard version of what everyone thinks Canada is like. There's also Maligne Canyon which has some pretty nice waterfalls as well. If you go to Jasper, the Tekarra Dining Room is really good, a bit pricey though. You can also check out Pyramid Lake, and there's a fairly decent restaurant there called The Pines.

This just shows they need to constantly be on their feet, especially if they're already being called plutocrats."

What's she doing in a party that presents itself as being the most progressive?  2) Not having a budget ready to go, leaving us twisting in the wind until September. Not good for keeping the economy as stable as possible. People will lose their jobs because of this, including people who voted NDP.   3) Money grab as blatant and high-handed as the most mercenary PC. Wait, what? Somewhere Redfraud is contemplating Notley and thinking ""I like the cut of her jib.""  Not even sworn in yet, and already 3 bad moves on the books. Would someone like to respond with points for? What can the NDP point to as achievements so far? Please don't hand me the ""give them some time"" excuse. It's not like they're newborn babies. The NDP has been around for longer than most redditors have been alive. Are you seriously saying they can't do better than this, especially after the leap of faith Albertans have made? Please don't list stuff like their promises to raise the minimum wage to $15.00 and to scrap the reintroduction of health care fees, those are just promises for the future made by politicians, and we know what those are worth. I would really like to see some good news.   And before you blow this off, just honestly imagine the fuss if the PCs had done any of this stuff."

You really expected all the parties had a full budget stored in a desk drawer? The criticism seems really far fetched.  Yes, the money grab is unseemly, and we ought to keep an eye on such gestures. But as elldrick said, give them the benefit of the doubt.    There will be real, impactful mistakes. Keep your powder dry until then or risk being the redditor who cries wolf."

Naw, there'll be more shit coming out on this woman, you can bet on it. The real issue is:Why didn't they know before hand? Why didn't they turn it around by having her bring all this stuff up and address it as part of her journey to self-realisation? The NDP will be dealing with all kinds of entities who want to screw us crosseyed, they need top be more on top of shit than this.  Considering the steady loss of jobs that are expected in the coming months, the NDP, the party of the workers, should be going hard to get things moving, not covering their asses, trying to figure out just how far they can push the oil companies. By September, the papers will be riddled with stories of jobless Newfies with 3 kids losing their condos and F-150s, and many of the stories will have convincing explanations about why more people would still be working if the NDP hadn't waited so long to let business know what the lay of the land was going to be in Alberta.   If we gave people the benefit of the doubt, Danielle Smith would be premier right now. Giving anyone the benefit of the doubt, especially politicians, just encourages bad behaviour. Scare the fuck out of them and they will stick to their knitting. We didn't force the job on them, they asked for it, demanded it.

Let's do away with that one first.  As for the examples you quoted; subsidies to Darryl Katz. Agreed; except that the Community Revitalization Levy seems to be working as its architects said it would. The Arena district is awash in new development.  Per cent for art. No problem here. Public art is essential to changing our city from a drab sub-Arctic sprawl to a place people might actually want to visit and live in.  All part of that mix along with good schools and health care.  The funicular. Already shot down once by council, I gotta agree that this one keeps raising its ugly head.  I must be obtuse, because I actually believe if there is a lot of fat in the provincial government, it must be in the PC stacked agencies, boards and commissions. The Edmonton public service is pretty bare bones; you can't fill potholes and plough snow on an ever expanding grid of roads without buying the occasional new truck, and Edmonton municipal taxes are significantly lower than most major cities in Canada.  Here's a shocking thought for you; I actually think our taxes have been lowered TOO much. Two parties offered me a chance to raise taxes in the recent election. I chose one. Obtuse indeed."

North American invasion of article  Zebra mussel:       They were first detected in Canada in the Great Lakes in 1988, in Lake St. Clair, located east/northeast of Detroit and Windsor.  It is believed they were inadvertently introduced into the lakes in the ballast water of ocean-going ships traversing the St. Lawrence Seaway. Another possible often neglected mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although this has not been proven. Since adult zebra mussels can survive out of water for several days or weeks if the temperature is low and humidity is high, chain lockers provide temporary refuge for clusters of adult mussels that could easily be released when transoceanic ships drop anchor in freshwater ports. They have become an invasive species in North America, and as such they are the target of Federal policy to control them, for instance in the National Invasive Species Act (1996).

You can bet the rent that the press and the NDP's political opponents (yes, that is redundant) are searching for more past pecadillos and also watching her carefully for any future newsworthy lapses in judgement.

It was a big story and sure, no one called for impeachment or anything but the media talked it to death.   Now as a thought experiment try to imagine if good old Bill had some photos surface of him chucking up deuces next to a pot leaf shirt or (and this one would have been waaaaayyyyy worse in the states) giving the finger to an American flag. The media reaction would have been much more intense and crazy than it was over a few words. A photo is worth a thousand words right?   Now I don't think she should lose her job over some silly pictures. But yes she should feel the back lash. She should feel stupid. Because she's a public figure and if she's got any hope of being smart enough to be a leader in this province she should probably have been smart enough to realize she should delete them as she begins her campaign.

Which is a complicated economy and a place with challenges other provinces would struggle to fathom.   Maybe in ten or fifteen years these people would be the leaders we need but their lack of real life experience is troubling to me.

alberta,36un0p,ApoliticalypseNow,0,Fri May 22 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"Conway's law:       Conway's law is an adage named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1968; it was first dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming.  It states that  organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations  Although sometimes construed as humorous, Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation. It is based on the reasoning that in order for two separate software modules to interface correctly, the designers and implementers of each module must communicate with each other. Therefore, the interface structure of a software system will reflect the social structure of the organization(s) that produced it.

I had worked rigs for 8 years before I finally bit the bullet and decided to go through 3 years of school with the hope of finally having steady employment as an educated man.   Last summer and fall were pretty slow for me but I got a contract to work for one of the bigger oilsands producers and was looking forward to a great busy winter. By December oil had tanked and uncertainty loomed. In January I went to work and unfortunately it only lasted until about February 10th. I haven't worked a day since and my contingency fund is very nearly empty.   For the last month and a half or so I've been trying every connection I have for work while at the same time applying for anything. Construction, rigs, truck driving, bartending, anything. Last night I got the first response I've gotten. It was for a forklift operator job. They're looking at other candidates lol.   TL;DR : this sucks. And I hope they're wrong. Sorry for the bitch session I just needed to vent."

Not sure if you're in Edmonton, but it seems like they're operating regardless of whether the government likes it or not. Might be a way to help tide you over until you get back on your feet again, depending on whether they're still taking applicants. I relied on UBER a lot during my recent medical trip to Houston and every driver I spoke to seemed to enjoy their work. Some of them even transitioned in to UBER permanently because they found it to be better than their full time jobs. Not sure if this helps you or not... Either way, all the best and I hope you find something soon."
alberta,36scyp,albertacrude,1 point,Thu May 21 20:25:21 2015 UTC,Thanks you for the advise! I did actually try that just a few days ago. I was pretty excited about it actually. Unfortunately my truck is owned by my company(I'm a contractor do I own it all but regardless it's all in the company's name) and has commercial insurance. Apparently the commercial insurance that UBER carries on all of its drivers would conflict with anything other than personal insurance so short of transferring title on my truck to me and insuring it under my name I'm boned.   Thanks again though I appreciate you taking a minute to provide some(would have been) great advice.

Not to mention that salaried workers aren't likely to see such a substantial pay increase either.   What bugs me about this too is minimum wage shouldn't be enough to sustain on for a long term. Minimum wage is for summer students, teenager and low skill entry level jobs. It's boy designed to support multiple people or families on.

alberta,36sidv,wildrosin,1 point,Fri May 22 00:51:11 2015 UTC,Such an unreasonable thought to think that a job should be able to provide enough money to survive. Its a fact that not only teens and summer students have min wage jobs. I dont know where you think summer students need even more debt.

This means  dramatic increase in truck and rail shipments, including many nasty chemicals thru our urban areas. That's why refineries are typically located by ports and near the failures that use the end products.

alberta,36o6yv,vindicateme,13,Wed May 20 20:36:50 2015 UTC,Is there a counter-petition I could sign?
alberta,36o6yv,broccolifucker,0,Wed May 20 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"From the Article ""In a recent Berkeley study undertaken with the California Highway Patrol’s assistance, 7,836 motorcycle crashes were examined closely, with some 1,163 of these crashes having occurred while the rider was lane splitting.  Riders who were splitting at the time of their accident were significantly less likely to be injured in every category than those who weren’t: 45 percent fewer head injuries, 21 percent fewer neck injuries, 32 percent fewer torso injuries, 12 percent fewer arm/leg injuries, and 55 percent fewer fatalities.""  If this is accurate then why would you want to counter-petition it? It gets the car and rider to their destination quicker and is safer for the rider."
alberta,36o6yv,synith90,7,Wed May 20 21:43:26 2015 UTC,You also just stated that roughly one in seven motorcycle accidents happen while lane splitting. Boom.
alberta,36o6yv,broccolifucker,0,Wed May 20 22:24:08 2015 UTC,"Yes that's true, but lets say those riders who were lane splitting are no longer, who's to say that there wouldn't be more accidents in total? Or less?  Either way if those accidents happened outside of lane splitting it would be more dangerous for the rider. It's not like you have to wait longer to get to your destination, if anything you'll get there quicker as a driver as there wont be motorbikes in your lane.  To be honest though, I don't have all the information and am not really qualified to defend the point this heavily.  Edit: It also states that the safest way to lane split is to only go up to 15kph faster than the stalled or slowly moving traffic, perhaps the reason for those lane splitting accidents was due to excessive speed? Once again, a lot of shooting in the dark going on here."

alberta,36izek,Findingthedot,3,Sun May 24 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"I had spent many years in the service industry. I do and will continue to tip well. Now when I tip, I'm more cognizant that I am not just rewarding great service, I am subsidizing a business. A business with an owner or CEO (depending on where I am) that probably makes many more dollars a year than me. A business that may be very successful, in part because of the low wage they get away with paying.  That is if you a lucky enough to work at a place where you get tips.  I'm going to bail on this comment before I turn into Mr. Pink.  edit: RD clip  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-qV9wVGb38"
alberta,36izek,Findingthedot,-2,Thu May 21 05:46:13 2015 UTC,"You're not subsidizing a business.  Businesses pay minimum wage because they know servers will get tipped - its the culture.    If tipping went away, expect prices to go up 20% or so, really not a whole lot would change."
alberta,36izek,Findingthedot,7,Tue May 19 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"yup, you are totally right. Not a lot would change for a paying customer, but there would be a lot less risk for the server.  edit: Yes, tipping is part of our culture, but could you not still characterize it as a subsidy? The restaurant is deriving an economic benefit by being able to pay less with the assumption that their customers will pick up their slack? I dunno. What little reading I have done recently on this subject has lead me to believe that we would be better off paying people better.  This article (albeit unrelated to the discussion here specific to tipping) looks at wall-mart employees and the cost to society of not paying people real living wages.  http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Taxpayers-and-Walmart-ATF.pdf  What do you think?"
alberta,36izek,Findingthedot,2,Tue May 19 22:44:15 2015 UTC,"So what your saying is if we stopped tipping businesses would pay their servers more? I don't think that's the case, look at any service industry were tipping isn't the norm ( retail, fast food , etc)   They will only pay more when it's mandated, ""paying someone minimum wage is just a businesses way of saying if they could pay you less, they would"" look at Australia they have a min wage of 16$ and they still have all their fast food and retail and macdonalds still costs the same it would anywhere else"

With the amount of temporary foreign workers available it's near impossible to push wages by not working at a place with min wage, the company simply states they can't get anyone to work the job and bam they got some cheap subsidized labour rather then simply offering a living wage so locals / people starting out will work there. Supply / demand is broken when they bring tfw in, a Filipino I worked with said he was contractually obligated to work at KFC for FIVE years before he could seek out another job (he ended up becoming a welding apprentice, which is another shit show because once they started hiring filipinos the bosses started pointing and them and saying ""look we can get him to so anything for 15$ an hour how about that, fuck canadians with their wanting to do things safely"")"

If anything, this is how the program is supposed to work - bring in TFWs to do jobs that Canadians won't do.    And you're right, hiring TFWs has broken the supply/demand equation, but there were many jobs that Canadians simply wouldn't do, especially when times were good.    Look at the US - plenty of Americans will work in foodservice for $9/hour.  Know any Albertan who will?  I was making more money when I was a teenager.

You're right, the outsourcing of not only jobs, but entire sectors of the economy is why we're in this mess.  We bring in foreign workers to work in foreign-owned oil corporations that ship our oil to foreign refineries, and wonder why we're left with a shit, one-track economy.

Gee, perhaps we should look at the data from other countries with extremely high minimum wages, where the response of mcdonalds has been to simply pay those wages and raise the price of a Big Mac.  Since they have not responded with automation, that's a pretty good indication that the threshold at which automation becomes a viable option is substantially higher.  But hey, maybe it's better to have people starving under a bridge while working full time than it is to expect companies to price their goods and services correctly, accounting for all their externalities. Maybe it's better to let those companies receive an effective subsidy of social services and government assistance for their employees to make up the gap between minimum wage and livable wage. Maybe you think that subsidy to business is the best use of your tax dollars.  I don't think that. I believe in making companies deal with economic reality."

The specialist has skills that typically only they, and a handful of others, poses that took sometimes close to a decade to acquire while the other guy can be trained in an evening. It's not only an unfair comparison but it's a disingenuous one as well.  While some people may be making more than they're worth in terms of output (plenty of evidence already here) paying market rate is important in order to attract talent. Talent costs money and for most government offices, in the general bureaucracy certainly, the wages paid by the government are quite low when compared to equivalent positions in the private sector. This disparity in wage actually causes a brain drain to the private sector, or to the semi-private sector, that hurts our ability to have a good government.

Sixteen people will lose their jobs, 14 vacant positions won’t be filled, and seven employees have been offered transfers to other branches, said AFSC spokesperson Nikki Booth.  As of May 1, eight branches will be closed, in Cardston, Lloydminster, Fort Vermilion, Valleyview, Slave Lake, Castor, Rocky Mountain House, and Fort Saskatchewan. AFSC’s Airdrie and Calgary branches will be combined into one office, at a location to be determined.  The soon-to-be-closed branches didn’t serve enough producers to be viable, said Booth.  “We looked at how many clients were served by all of our offices and determined that some of these offices were servicing as few as five clients,” she said.  AFSC should not see any disruption in service when their accounts are transferred to nearby branches, said Booth.  The closures will see the number of AFSC offices fall from 55 to 46."
alberta,36bgaz,harrybalzac71,3,Mon May 18 02:53:47 2015 UTC,"So, now we're going to hear a bunch of news stories asking the NDP to perform what the PCs and Wildrose promised.   To be clear, I'm not saying that these ministers deserve their salaries, either. Let's just realize that many of them were appointed by the PCs over the years. But, I want to point out that conflating these people with all public servants (as some of the rhetoric suggests) is out of line, and it perpetuates the same private vs. public split that PCs were trying to foster in order to kill public service and break unions.  It further deflects examination in to other sources of revenue for the province: corporate/oil money, which is partly why the NDP was elected. People are tired of the income inequality in AB. The problem is not the public service. The problem is poor policy on royalties, among other things."

Donovan, Ian, Little Bow (W) Brad Klak President and Managing Director, Agriculture Financial Services Corporation Hon. Verlyn Olson, QC Minister John Knapp Deputy Minister    Mr. Knapp: The compensation for board members is, I believe, what the member is referring to. That’s set out in a set of government schedules. There’s a range of different government schedules, and that’s chosen basically on the level of the assignment, you know, the degree of difficulty, and in some cases the difficulty of finding the precise skill. For example, one of the ALMA board members negotiated Canada’s NAFTA deal with the United States and Mexico, so you’ve got some very high skill levels. The schedule is set out from government compensation schedules in accordance with that.  Mr. Donovan: Okay. Thank you for that. Yes, the skill level is definitely very high. I think that’s what our industry needs. There are lots of positives to that. Does ALMA post expenses, as our government, if we’re using the government schedule? Do they post all their expenses, the board members’ expenses and all of that? I, again, looked and couldn’t find it.  Mr. Olson: Yes, it does, you know, as any government agency is required to these days. I gather that it’s on the website.  Mr. Donovan: Okay. Maybe I just need a link sent to me at some point just so I can get all that. I was kind of scattered around it and wasn’t having a good look.   Back to ALMA and some of the boards that they have, again back to picking people on it. Now, one of them was the straw man group that’s going around and doing some marketing and whatnot on that. That’s the same process that’s taken to appoint those people as is done with the board members for those subcommittees. The board itself decides who’s on the subcommittees?   Mr. Olson: We’re looking at each other here. I’m not entirely sure I understood the question, but if you’re asking whether, for example, I as minister appointed those people, no, I did not. You know, ALMA certainly has the flexibility to engage people to assist it with projects that it’s working on. My assumption would be that that’s how those people were selected by ALMA.  Mr. Donovan: Okay. Those are just, again, questions that people ask on stuff. You know, back on the funding side of that, I guess we answered the capital one there. I guess AFSC is one that I’d also like to get into. Now, I’d assume that when we go to AFSC, the posting of expenses online is also done through there.  Mr. Olson: Yes.  Mr. Donovan: Now, I’ve been told that there’s a bit of a challenge in trying to get some of the numbers out of that. There’s some information that’s been FOIPed that’s in a building that has bad foundations or something and can’t be tracked down. I guess it’s about trying to find information. As taxpayers people just want to know what’s being spent. Some of the stuff that’s been FOIPed on that: we’ve been told we can’t get to it. Now, I don’t know if there’s a better explanation of that than what I’ve heard.  Mr. Klak: If I might, the challenge in accessing some of our information is that our policy is that we keep three years of information for board and for executive expenses, and then we send anything past that to the Alberta records, to the archive. We’re compliant with the policy. It might be the same situation for ALMA as ourselves. If you actually go to our websites, to the ALMA website or to the AFSC website, I think our information is easier to find posted than going through the government of Alberta. With regard to the information we were as surprised as anyone when we asked to find out if we could access our information, and they told us that due to structural issues in that building, they’re not allowing anyone in until they’ve done a full engineering assessment of it. It’s causing us some hardship. Even trying to access information for previous employees that are now going through job searches: it’s being locked up in that records centre right now as well. We’ve asked what type of a time frame that we can expect, and they told us that they’ll know more after they do the initial engineering assessment. I understand what you’re saying. It’s just that we’re kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.   Mr. Donovan: Thank you for that. I know that us checking out FOIP inquiries can shake the foundations a little; I just didn’t know it actually knocked a building to where it was unsafe to go into."

I don't know how they can claim to know the will of NDP voters when including answers from those who didn't vote NDP. For the 40.6% of voters that did vote NDP, It very well may have been about the NDP, hope and Notley and this survey doesn't demonstrate otherwise:   Sixty-two per cent of Albertans said the results were about anger, compared with 38 per cent who believed they were about hope. NDP voters were far more likely to say the outcome was driven by hope and Notley’s likability."
alberta,36bq7z,PickerPilgrim,1 point,Tue May 19 22:14:14 2015 UTC,The poll asked the respondents opinion of why other people in the province voted and not about why the respondents themselves voted.  But the actual poll has some nice tables at the bottom.  They show that more people who voted PC and wildrose thought that people voted NDP because they were angry.  And a greater proportion of NDP supporters opinion is that people voted NDP for hope.  I think the poll would indicate that PC/WR voters appear unable to reconcile that people voted NDP because they wanted to rather than some knee jerk reaction to the PC campaign.  I also believe that the poll indicates that WR voters were motivated by Anger and Jim's arrogance rather than anything the WR did.
alberta,36bq7z,FinalDetail,0,Wed May 20 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"My primary purpose voting this time around was ""NOT PC"".  If another party (yes, even WR) had a chance to beat the PC in my riding, I would have voted for them.  However, I'm still pleased with the NDP majority, and I imagine most of the surveyed are as well.  Edit - my point being it's a dumb survey that implies the majority did NOT want an NDP leadership.

If you recall a few years ago, there were a lot of articles about how oil sands producers were struggling due to the ""discount"" that WCS traded at vs. WTI, about $40/bbl at the time. Over the past few years, due largely to smart investment in transportation infrastructure (pipeline improvements, bitumen-by-rail improvements, etc. etc.), the discount has narrowed to something like $10/bbl. That's a $30/bbl increase in value for producers, simply for making it easier to get the oil to market.  On top of that, there are a lot of new technologies in the works that will make extraction more efficient and less expensive. Worldwide, oil may be taking a huge hit, but in AB, the situation is not particularly worse than anything we're used to."

Of course they did, and voters felt the PCs had the weakest policies while the NDP had the best policies. That is a concept that the Fraser Institute can't abide- that democratic socialism will result in a stronger economy. Despite every study showing that, nationally, the NDP have been better job creators and better fiscal managers than conservatives.  P4: NDP favours unrestrained spending, immoderate royalties, and a higher personal income tax. Do you know another word for spending? Investment! The NDP knows that investing in education and health care has financial returns for governments. They're long term investments, which is beyond the Fraser Institute's comprehension because they only understand the quarterly reports their owners read.  The NDP has called for a review of royalties, not a suggested immoderate levels. That's a myth the industry promotes, without basis.  And tiered income tax doesn't mean higher levels for all, just for those who can afford it.  The Fraser Institute is not an economic think-tank, it's a right wing propaganda machine. Nothing more. That's not a personal attack, it's fact."
alberta,35z53g,thedloan,-2,Fri May 15 01:29:27 2015 UTC,"Many PC voters went over to the NDP because they were sick of over 40 years of the same party and they wanted a change. Wildrose was too scary, Liberals were a basketcase, and NDP was the only option.   Consumption (spending) is very different from investment (saving). Ie: you might spend money on health care to treat cancer, or you may invest in a company researching a cure for cancer. This is what the article is getting at.   You should read what many of the new NDP MP's have to say about royalties. Immoderate levels is putting it lightly."

alberta,35u7oi,Shaxinater,8,Wed May 13 16:49:38 2015 UTC,I would have absolutely no issues with that. As long as they take each case into consideration individually and assist in providing any healthcare required by the individuals. Mental health or other. The last thing I would want to do is push these people back onto the streets with harsh programs that don't foster rehabilitation in the first place.
alberta,35u7oi,Sidewinder77,1 point,Wed May 13 16:55:08 2015 UTC,Isn't healthcare already provided for everyone in Canada regardless of income?
alberta,35u7oi,Ironhorn,6,Wed May 13 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"""Healthcare"" is a pretty broad category. An ER visit is free. But you don't get literally everything for free, especially not when it comes to mental health services."
alberta,35u7oi,Sidewinder77,1 point,Wed May 13 17:09:18 2015 UTC,Psychiatric services are part of the public healthcare system. What other services are missing and thus contributing to keeping homeless people from having shelter?
alberta,35u7oi,Kamades,5,Wed May 13 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Medication.  If I didn't have insurance, the medication  that keeps me able to work would be 350 bucks a month."

alberta,35u7oi,MorgothEatsUrBabies,7,Wed May 13 20:41:54 2015 UTC,How is it not also society's problem though? In what world is it preferable to render someone homeless instead of helping them pay for the medication that allows them to be a functionning and contributing member of the group?

alberta,35u7oi,Blackborealis,2,Wed May 13 21:10:16 2015 UTC,Psychiatry is not what a lot of these people need though.  They need less drugs not more.   A lot would benefit greatly from psychological services and counselling (things not covered by national/provincial healthcare).
alberta,35u7oi,MorgothEatsUrBabies,0,Wed May 13 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"Where I am you can get free counseling at the mental health clinic in the local hospital - it takes ~12 weeks to get an appointment and you have 6 free counselling sessions, after that you're on your own.  There's no way in hell that's sufficient or adequate for someone with mental health issues profound enough to lead to homelessness."
alberta,35u7oi,Sidewinder77,1 point,Wed May 13 20:35:35 2015 UTC,Waiting lists are not uncommon in Alberta's health care system. Many procedures have wait lists over 6-months long.
alberta,35u7oi,MorgothEatsUrBabies,1 point,Wed May 13 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The point being simply that current mental health offering are not sufficient to handle the homelessness issue - whether that's because of waiting lists or because of insuficient service level (6 visits max is laughable - practically no one will get better with 6 counselling visits).  Your comment was   Isn't healthcare already provided for everyone in Canada regardless of income?   The fact is that even though yes, healthcare is technically provided, in reality it's not enough to handle that particular problem."
alberta,35u7oi,Shaxinater,4,Wed May 13 20:55:22 2015 UTC,It is to an extent. Mental healthcare is not explicitly provided for unless you are deemed an immediate risk to yourself. Lots of cases go untreated due to never having a chance to get help.
alberta,35u7oi,Ironhorn,4,Wed May 13 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"Many (not all of course) homeless either already have jobs (but can't afford to keep on top of all their expenses), or can't get jobs due to a disability. So any repayment programme would have to be customized."

I'd like to understand just what kind of expenses are preventing them from having shelter.  The government had programs to specifically support those with disabilities.
alberta,35u7oi,Ringthebells,6,Wed May 13 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"I work in the homeless sector. I think part of your statement comes from the popular image of homeless people. Older, male, probably suffering from addiction or mental health issues, right? That's the popular perception anyways. It makes it easy to place blame, or write off as a ""lost cause.""   The fastest growing homeless population in Alberta however, does not match that image. Families make up the fastest growing homeless population in Alberta, single a day dual parent units alike. Children are simply expensive, and landlords are allowed to discriminate against an individual having children. There's zero protection in place like there is for age or gender.   Alleviating the suffering of another needs not to increase ones own hardship. If you're unwilling to support the development of a solution monetarily, perhaps volunteering is more for you. We certainly need it, emergency social services isn't exactly well funded. I hope that helps."
alberta,35u7oi,Sidewinder77,1 point,Wed May 13 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"I don't dispute that there are homeless people that genuinely need help and I would like to see them get that help. I'd be happy to volunteer or donate towards helping those people.   However, I'm skeptical that many families in a place like Alberta would become homeless and unable to get ahead. Since you work in the sector, what kind of budget/expenses do these families have (ballpark figures)."
alberta,35u7oi,Kamades,2,Wed May 13 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Without medical coverage through my job, and through my parents before I got working, the medication I need to remain a functional human being costs about 350 a month, and then I required spinal surgery with its own fun subset of costs in drugs and rehab.  At one point, without coverage I would have been running 750/month in medication.  If I hadn't had the opportunity to go to school for a fe years, my medication would make housing extremely untenable."
alberta,35u7oi,Sidewinder77,0,Wed May 13 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your example. Would you say that a typical homeless person has a medical prescription bill of $350-$750/month?  Note, prescription medications are covered by AISH"

From your link:  "" Also, he/she is likely to continue to be affected permanently because no remedial therapy is available that would materially improve the person’s ability to earn a regular livelihood. ""  I can't speak for ""typical"", as I don't have a good grasp on what ailments the ""typical"" homeless person has.  All I know is that a couple years of support lead to me being able to buy a house, maintain a job, and be a useful part of the economy, as opposed to someone in massive pain and constant seizures, which WOULD have rendered me either homeless or working homeless."

alberta,35u7oi,Sidewinder77,2,Wed May 13 20:48:22 2015 UTC,What's the alternative? Keep giving employed people free shelter even when they make enough money to pay for that shelter?
alberta,35u7oi,BlackStrain,2,Wed May 13 20:05:24 2015 UTC,I meant more if they don't search for a job.  If they start earning money then yes it should be re-evaluated.  Maybe they should pay a portion of the cost as their income increases.  It would have to be done gently though or else you encourage them not to find a job.  If they remain unemployed (and some of them will be completely unemployable regardless of what we do) then I suppose they're just sheltered indefinitely if the cost of doing so is less than the cost of them being homeless.

Since you can only send in for 1 draw per species you don't get to hunt during the other seasons if you choose bowhunting. I think the outfitters brought this forward to ease pressure on mule deer.    Landowner tags, they wanted to make them for the whole MWU you live in. This was brought forward by the elk hating counties. ESRD added that they were now antleress only to prevent abuse.  Capping the draw priority at 10 was supposed to stop people from hoarding it, but in some cases it could mean with some poor luck you could never get drawn.    Bighorn sheep, according to the esrd are getting small because certain age groups are getting taken out with general tags. They are either looking at draws or full curl rule.

I'd heard of a new grassroots, right-wing party with some fascinating ideas about a return to balanced budgets, along with proposals to increase the accountability of elected officials. They're based in the western provinces, but have been growing a solid base of voters nationwide. I think they're called the ""Reform"" party. One of their up-and-comers is an MP named Steve Harper. He's made some great speeches in parliament about the need to end all omnibus bills, for example.  I'm sure that if he becomes PM, the days of top-down PMO decisionmaking overruling local riding associations, government spying on innocent private citizens, overreaching omnibus bills, whipped votes, and gigantic debt-increasing deficit budgets will be a thing of the past."

alberta,35llfr,IMG_throwaway,26,Mon May 11 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a medical doctor that has become qualified through the International Medical Graduate program. I was lucky to have found success through the program, but I've seen many others like me that have given up on Canada and left the country due to an inability to obtain a license here. I have friends, some of which are trained specialists in their home country, continue to work any job just to stay alive as cleaners or taxi drivers.  From what I've seen, the PCs have allowed the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) to regulate the number of doctors trained in Alberta and the number of qualified International doctors that will be granted a licence here. For years they have turned a blind eye as the AMA kept these numbers too low ensuring that there is never too many doctors and fees are kept very high. As a result there are many places in the province that do not have a doctor and waiting lists are long.    It's absurd that there are thousands of qualified foreign trained doctors that could work in Alberta but are not granted a path to a license by the AMA. To clarify, these are doctors meet all minimum requirements of the Canadian system and have passed all the requirements to enter into Canadian practice/residency, but cannot obtain a license.   The NDP should strip the AMA of the power to regulate the number of doctors in Alberta and give it to a more neutral and independent group made up of doctors/managers/patients. Let more doctors be trained here and provide all qualified international medical professionals a transparent and straightforward path to obtaining their license."
alberta,35llfr,msd90,14,Mon May 11 21:58:26 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the AMA does this because they want to keep the salaries of doctors artificially high. So they put these outrageous restrictions in place to keep other doctors out. The AMA wants scarcity of doctors because it simply works in favour of their members.
alberta,35llfr,Haxim,6,Mon May 11 16:09:05 2015 UTC,"Bingo. The AMA organizations empowered by they provincial government to act in the public interest have a HUGE conflict of interest!  Maybe we could let a board of patients decide the 'fair' number of doctors allowed to be licensed in Alberta. Or, better yet implement direct democracy on matters like this and let voters cast a ballot. The NDP seem like an ideal government to perhaps implement e-government and let Albertan's vote online from time to time on key policy matters."
alberta,35llfr,J__rad,7,Mon May 11 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"Bingo. The AMA has a HUGE conflict of interest!

They have also been given explicit direction to expedite the process to lower the overinflated salaries here and give more access to physicians.  The real issue is that international schools are nowhere near the same quality as here. If this Sidewinder guy was actually a physician, he could come and work under a partial license for less money for 1-2 years, then take an exam and get licensed.  Seems to me he is either not a physician, or has a very questionable medical degree."

alberta,35llfr,JeffBoner,1 point,Tue May 12 12:42:49 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on successfully qualifying through the Alberta-IMG program. I know of several colleagues who have done the same. Just wanted to clarify a few things, based on my understanding and many hours of searches of the relevant programs and organizations, and reading through government laws, with a prior background in public health and policy.  The AMA is an association of Alberta's physicians, but does not have the authority to regulate the number of physicians; it advocates on behalf of its members to the government, serves its members and promotes health to the public. This is the body that negotiates fee schedules with the government.  The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, by the authority of Alberta's Health Professions Act, regulates the practice of medicine in Alberta and issues certificates of registration to physicians to allow them to practice; this body is responsible for the addition of physicians to its register, a list of physicians who have the privilege to practice in Alberta, in various capacities (limited, supervised, independent, etc.), depending on level of training/qualifications and other factors. The College is governed by a council that includes physicians, public members and representatives from Alberta’s medical schools.   The Alberta IMG program (http://www.aimg.ca/), which offers a path (http://aimga.ca/process-licensure/) to a medical license for IMGs, is ultimately funded by the Alberta government. Funding is required for the on-the-job training (residency) that IMGs receive, just like Canadian medical graduates, to ensure that IMGs are qualified to practice in the Canadian system. Because of a number of factors, including scarce government money, specialty-specific needs and limited teaching capacity, residency spots are limited.  It is unfortunate that internationally educated physicians have been misled about the situation in Canada. Doctors are not needed everywhere and in every specialty; they are needed more in primary care and more in rural areas/the North. It is more difficult to receive a residency spot as an IMG in Canada than it is in the USA, but the situation in the USA is becoming more difficult and is projected to get worse.  Ultimately, of course, one of the better ways to improve the health of the patient (and lower healthcare costs) is to prevent the disease before it happens through public health efforts and keep chronic disease patients out of hospital by effective management of the chronic disease in primary care networks."
alberta,35llfr,J__rad,0,Mon May 11 21:35:55 2015 UTC,"You're wrong, the key reason residency spots are limited is because the College intentionally limits them. In the past there were many more spots and they were cut back because the College was concerned there were too many doctors. Obviously it's well worth it to get trained and qualified medical graduates or other professionals through the final step of residency. The Health Professions Act should be amended so that a more independent body will control the number of people that get into residency.  The PCN's do little to change the fact that our medical system is overwhelmingly focused on disease care, not preventative health care. But that's an entirely different subject."
alberta,35llfr,joseville,3,Mon May 11 20:41:53 2015 UTC,You're both right.   IMG spots are limited because funding for residency is limited. CMG spots are also limited for the same reason. For example there are not 100 dermatology residency positions in Winnipeg. I don't think this is anything against IMG's. We need more family doctors so more residency spots have been opened up. We need more surgery capabilities (in AB at least) but it isn't funded so there would be no jobs for any surgeons to even do. We can only train so many residents given how many staff are employed to train those residents. This is s limiting factor as well. We could not have 40 gen surg residents for each staff. Residents would get to operate once a month and learn virtually nothing. So you are both right. It is a multi faceted problem.   Yes supply is definitely controlled. This is okay though. The path is difficult and the lifestyle can be horrendous and the mental hardship  Canada has a large amount of specialists who cannot find jobs. For example a thoracic surgeon has worked maybe 3mo in 2years. This leads them to take on fellowships and become more specialized. This is especially true for surgeons. For specialists that can open their own clinics it is not as bad (ie. Derm). Med Student is right on this and also right on the real needs. If an IMG wanted to practice in northern Ontario or the territories or anywhere rural really they would have s much higher degree of success as there is need there and less people want to work there so less competition.
alberta,35llfr,Ashlir,3,Mon May 11 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"Er.. maybe you're talking to the wrong people. Licensing is up to the CPSA, not the AMA. Makes me think you just might not be a physician if you don't know that.  Also, it has been a priority of pretty much all parties lately to expedite the acceptance of foreign qualifications. The sad fact is that most international schools do not shape up to Canadian standards."

alberta,35llfr,Ashlir,-1,Tue May 12 12:13:56 2015 UTC,I doubt the NDP would drop a protectionist system like that. They have a vested interest in keeping competition low and prices high. The unions would shit bricks of they had to compete with well trained former foreigners.
alberta,35llfr,Windig0,3,Mon May 11 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"I regularly see many patients going without the care they really need and I am advocating here for them. I'd like to think that the NDP will put prioritize the welfare of patients in Alberta ahead of keeping doctor numbers low. Trust me, many more doctors can be added and it will still be very lucrative for medical professionals."
alberta,35llfr,Ashlir,-3,Mon May 11 17:22:21 2015 UTC,This (NDP/Unions) is a group of people that think more money solves problems not less money and more competition. But I have to agree there are too many people going untreated because of a serious lack of competition. I would love to see the good old days of personal in home care care at an affordable price. Competition breeds innovation. We should not be artificially reducing the supply of a good thing like doctors and nurses.

alberta,35llfr,Ashlir,0,Mon May 11 17:52:53 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with a working model being used on a variety of customers. It used to be the norm the doctor came to you. Most early hospitals were run by churches and specialized in treating the poor. Not too say I am in favor of religion. But if helping the needy is as important to them as they say it is we should let them do it. Not steal the extra funds people once had to support things like free hospitals for the poor. After all if a bunch of religious zealots could get together and pool funds to help the poor then imagine what they could do with today's resources. Or what a secular system could do  without being hobbled by protectionism and anticompetitive regulations.

alberta,35llfr,cgsur,21,Tue May 12 01:21:31 2015 UTC,Open competition for contracts. The most notable is Navigator that secured millions in government contracts because their leaders donated 90k$ to the PCAA. This will save Albertans money and will separate government and business.

alberta,35llfr,JeffBoner,8,Tue May 12 05:07:34 2015 UTC,"Long time lurker. I'm in the Land Surveying industry and I see many changes that could be made to the industry to the benefit of land owners.  When Land Surveying first began in Western Canada, surveyors would measure boundaries and place monuments at all deflections. Typically this meant placing a ~2ft long iron post in the ground. This served the purpose of letting landowners know where their boundaries were, and provincial laws make the position of the monument a governing location.  Today when you want to subdivide your land need to hire an Alberta Land Surveyor to come to your property, find any posts that define the boundary, and place new posts where the new subdivision is. It's a lot of work to locate these monuments, dig them up, and then place new ones. The cost of this process can range from $500 to $5000+. Here's the thing, with computers and GPS we can easily keep track of boundaries using coordinates in a GIS. There's no need to keep on placing monuments when we could just use coordinates to define boundaries. There's no reason that in many cases the survey cost of subdividing land could be reduced to less than $50.  The director of surveys has started an initiative to move towards using coordinates on crown land, but it does not go far enough. The Alberta Land Surveyors Association is a self-governing professional organization that has shown constant resistance to using coordinates because it would drastically cut the cost of land surveys for Albertans.   A number of laws require Albertans to have Alberta Land Surveyors place iron posts on their boundary including the Surveys Act, Municipal Government Act, and Pipeline Act. These laws need to be amended and Land Surveyors must be compelled into changing with the times."
alberta,35llfr,AntonBanton,3,Tue May 12 05:32:44 2015 UTC,That can be applied to any professional/occupational association IMO.

alberta,35llfr,AntonBanton,9,Mon May 11 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"I was doing some research for work today, and discovered that Alberta has 248 agencies, boards, and commissions.

alberta,35llfr,Anabiotic,10,Mon May 11 21:50:38 2015 UTC,The Alberta utilities commission isn't bad but it is stocked with industry insiders. Not patronage. The real problem is the deregulated electricity market. It has done nothing but drive up costs and allow companies to make more money compared to every other province where most electricity is publicly owned.
alberta,35llfr,JeffBoner,3,Tue May 12 01:09:40 2015 UTC,Not patronage? I'd say a commission made up of insiders from companies that gave thousands to the Tories is the definition of patronage.

alberta,35llfr,J__rad,7,Fri May 15 00:32:40 2015 UTC,Less privatization (that benefits the PCs' business donors instead if the public) and no more sole-sourced contracts.
alberta,35llfr,trasie,6,Sat May 16 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"Sole-sourced contracts can be a good idea under a certain limit.  Scenario: The government needs a contractor for an urgent issue. Say, their IT system is crapped and needs an expert to come in and fix stuff.  Option 1: Sole source the same guy who was there last time to come in. File the paperwork Monday, he gets to work Tuesday, the job is done Friday. You spend $15,000.  Option 2: Open the process for public bidding. File the paperwork Monday, receive bids two weeks later, spend a week deciding (end up picking the same guy as option 1), hire someone, submit the paperwork, and they come in a week after after board approval. You spend $15,000 on the contract, $5,000 on the process, and the month delay cost your department $300,000 in productivity because their systems crashed.  This is what sole sourced contracts are for. They were not supposed to be for massive contracts. They are supposed to be for urgent issues that need specialized support.  A blanket ban on sole sourcing is a horrible idea."
alberta,35llfr,Dabookitty,3,Mon May 11 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not an insider, but I've spent a lot of time thinking about transportation.   Since 2009, smartphone based ridesharing companies have been enabling the sharing of transportation between regular people, making transportation significantly more convenient and affordable. In 2015 in hundreds of cities around the world have very large ride sharing operations with thousands of drivers that often outnumber taxi drivers. Relative to the rest of North American cities, Alberta has become embarrassingly unprogressive in this area. Under the PC government, no legislation that I'm aware of ever cleared the way to allow this emerging industry to operate in Alberta. I'd like to see everything done to explicitly legalize ride sharing companies which might include removing the power of cities to block these operations.   Realistically, since there is such a strong union component to the taxi industry, and ridesharing companies will cannibalize some taxi drivers and trips that previously were made by taxi, I suspect the NDP government will be no more helpful in this area than the PCs were."
alberta,35llfr,Dabookitty,5,Tue May 12 12:31:36 2015 UTC,I think the main opposition to these ride share companies are safety and regulation concerns.  Union pressure certainly factors in but not nearly as heavily as all the legal considerations.  These companies need time to mature before we give them free reign in transportation markets.
alberta,35llfr,Dabookitty,3,Mon May 11 16:41:37 2015 UTC,is this a provincial issue or a local city issue?
alberta,35llfr,Windig0,5,Tue May 12 02:24:22 2015 UTC,"Cities currently regulate the issuance of taxi licenses and many cities have used that as a reason to regulate private ride sharing services. I beleive the close relationship between Alberta cities and taxi associations has created a conflict of interest and cities are not acting in the best interest of Albertans when they block ride sharing operations. Some US states have moved to remove the ability of cities to regulate ride sharing. There's no reason Alberta couldn't do the same.  Also, the province sets insurance policy and could modify that policy to affect ride sharing."
alberta,35llfr,Dabookitty,8,Mon May 11 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"The province should not modify insurance requirements. They currently require taxi drivers to have commercial insurance and a class 4 license. This is nothing but a good idea.  Cities should remove forced monopolies and caps on taxi companies. This is purely a municipal issue, unless the Municipal Government Act is changed specifically to ban it (which it will not be). The courts have explicitly ruled that cities have the power to regulate taxis, so it is up to them.  Lobby your City Councillor to allow ridesharing. Also lobby your ridesharing company to require proper licensing and insurance."
alberta,35llfr,Dabookitty,-1,Mon May 11 19:44:56 2015 UTC,Ridesharing in other jurisdictions is operating just fine without commercial insurance. The ridesharing companies have been providing blanket insurance coverage that protects the driver/passenger. Someone casually providing private rides occasionally or carpooling a few times a week should not be required to have commercial insurance.
alberta,35llfr,Dabookitty,5,Tue May 12 12:24:38 2015 UTC,"Observing Reddiquette and not downvoting, but I disagree strongly with the idea that any commercial enterprise - ridesharing company or rideshare contractor - is ""just fine"" without proper insurance. That's akin to saying that a renter is ""just fine"" without renter's insurance: technically they are, until something happens and then what happens? Well, I've seen enough news stories to believe that it's going to be the contractor/driver on the hot seat, not the company, and that's not ""just fine"" with me.   Second, you're making a false comparison between people who provide transportation for a living (e.g. taxi drivers, rideshare contractors) and those who give rides as a favour or without compensation (because sharing carpool expenses is not making a living providing carpooling services). If it's your living, you need to make sure you are covered appropriately. If it's not, your own insurance policy should be sufficient. So there's no point in fearmongering.   And to bring it back to the thread topic, I would love to see legislation/policies that support all forms of alternative transportation (e.g. allowing carshare companies to access driver's abstracts with a person's approval AND requiring them to do so as part of membership to ensure safety of the public) would make me happy, as would support for sustainable transportation options for cities and between rural communities."
alberta,35llfr,J__rad,-1,Tue May 12 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"Ridesharing in other jurisdictions is operating just fine without commercial insurance   NO NO NO!! NO IT IS NOT!

Every jurisdiction in Canada is working on getting ride of Uber like services for exactly this reason.   ridesharing companies have been providing blanket insurance coverage that protects the driver/passenger   Please read the actual policy wordings on this!!  I have read Uber's policy...it is not a blanket coverage at all.  It is an excess Liability policy ONLY!  Since Uber does not actually own the vehicles it CAN NOT insure them for damage at all.    The way Uber's insurance works is it will only react once underlying the policy limit of the driver is reached...then they will pay the excess.  And since driving without Commerical Insurance as a ride for hire, violates the contract of personal insurance, the $200,000 statutory limit in place for LIABILTIY ONLY!  Uber will not cover a driver's injuries(That is what Section B of your insurance is for) or damage to the vehicle.     Someone casually providing private rides occasionally or carpooling a few times a week should not be required to have commercial insurance   Car Pooling is different then a Ride for Hire.   Car pooling you pick everyone up and go to one location and you are done...parked, no going to pick more people up.  Private rides are fine to.  But then Uber is not a service between friends...it is an app that connects a Buyer of a Sevice with a provider of a service.  How you get your product does not change the product itself.  Uber and companies like that are Ride for Hire companies...they just use an App instead of a call centre for dispatch."

For other NDP (opposition) parties, this is a big issue in their platforms. I hope the AB NDP picks up on this and does anything, even a small fix like preferential voting.  If I wanted to ask the government about this but I'm not represented by a government MLA, who would be the best memeber to contact about issues? I know federally when Jean stepped down all constituents were to contact the party whip but I'm not sure if it would be the same provincially."
alberta,35n2fl,canadient_,2,Mon May 11 23:48:44 2015 UTC,I would love to see a change like this. The libertarians would clean house. After all if you can't have the government that will do what you want. You might as well have a second option of the one the will leave you alone instead.
alberta,35n2fl,Ashlir,2,Tue May 12 05:41:39 2015 UTC,"It's not in their platform but it's in party policy. Platforms are just a fraction of party policies. People within the party who realize that if the Tories and Wildrose get their act together and merge will be pushing for change because they known this could be a one term deal.   I wouldn't expect a change before the next election. Most of the provinces that have looked at steps for reform had some sort of commission that studied electoral reform, made a recommendation for what changes should be made and then referendums were held. It's a process that takes years and I wouldn't expect anything to be different here.  If you're looking for who to contact contact your own MLA even if they are opposition. Once the cabinet is out figure out if there's a minister with democratic reform or something that sounds relevant as part of their portfolio. If it's not obvious just contact the Premier's office."

alberta,35lz3c,LandmanCA,1 point,Mon May 11 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"Not too sure, the best thing to do would be to find some clauses in the landlord tenancy act, such as quiet enjoyment, and read over your lease to see what is included in the contract you signed.   Write a letter to your landlord explaining why you are seeking damages and include those clauses, and go from there. Also calling the government department in charge of the landlord tenancy act might get you some valuable resources as well."

alberta,35lz3c,Dabookitty,0,Mon May 11 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"We didn't realize there was a serious problem at first. The sewage pipe in the crawl space was overflowing onto the ground, and we never go down there. We noticed paint peeling off the walls in the hallway months ago (edit: and the lingering shit smell which we managed with Glade and such), and we alerted him to the problem immediately. He said he would take care of it when he was in town next, but he has been out of the country and did not send anyone to look at it. The property management company did not send anyone either.   When I discovered the sewage mess, we went to a hotel while plumbers removed tree roots for about 2 hours, as it was about 10pm and my wife, daughter and I had work and school the next day. In the morning, I called the town's health inspector in, and he made note of some critical issues that needed to be addressed before we should return to the home. Later that day, a cleanup crew came to check it out, and they quickly noted that the mess was beyond their abilities, and recommended a vacuum truck. The vacuum truck guys came and laughed at the problem, saying that it will fix itself. The landlord and property management company then told us to return to the house. I said 'Fuck that!', and had the inspector come back in (which took another two days). At that point, he called the management company and told them to come down and see the problem. This was the first time they came to take a look. They now agreed that it needed attention after all. This whole process took 8 days. If they had cleaned it up on the same day as the inspector came in, it would only have cost me $120 and I'd have no problem footing the bill.   They haven't prorated rent or offered to pick up the tab, and I really think this is their fault for being inattentive. Am I wrong to think that they should help?"
alberta,35lz3c,FightingShibas,2,Mon May 11 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"The landlord is expected to cover some reasonable costs of providing a place for you to stay. At a minimum it would be the rent for the days you paid but were not provided a place to live. That usually won't cover hotel and meals, so then you would have to go to small claims court if they refused to pay reasonable costs up to your deductible."

The biggest argument is his immense experience in the legislature, which is necessary in the position, because she might want to keep her few experienced mlas close to her in the cabinet. You don't need to keep that position in your party and they're not going to want to give it to wildrose or pc because of their immense right bias. He's intelligent and experienced and imo a great choice."
alberta,35j2vs,navi_is_dead,6,Sun May 10 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"100% agree that Dr. Swann is the best choice as Speaker of the House; he has the experience and the gravitas the position demands, and it saves Ms. Notley from losing one experienced parliamentarian from her small reserve.  Also, the Speaker is second only to the Premier in order of precedence, an honour which may appeal to Swann who is officially an independent in the Legislature (no party status if less than 4 members). However, the position is technically not the Premiers to award.  It is elected by all members of the House from a slate consisting of all members who do not formally decline.  Shouldnt be a problem with a majority caucus. http://alberta.ca/how-government-works.cfm"
alberta,35j2vs,DocBrown59,5,Sun May 10 22:36:44 2015 UTC,I did not know that Swann is technically independent though that makes sense and I did not understand the selection method! Thanks!

We're 4 years from an election and I doubt the Liberals would be able to have a resurgence if they have no presence in the legislature so I imagine the party might bar David Swann from accepting the position. But then again, David Swann was surprisingly celebrating the NDP win on Election Day despite his party losing all but one seat..."

I'm not sure that there is an Alberta Liberal brand to be resuscitated, and if there is, I'm sure Dr. Swann does not have the fire in his belly to lead that charge.  He was a very reluctant interim leader during this campaign. One would hope that Laurie Blakeman will take a well-deserved holiday, and come back as a visible, if unelected, face of Alberta Liberals.   edit - formatting"
alberta,35j2vs,ModoReese,1 point,Sun May 10 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"He might want to do it and I agree that he would be a good choice, but the party might not allow him to do so unless he decides to sit as an independent, and it is way too early for any floor crossings.

alberta,35j2vs,ModoReese,7,Mon May 11 00:03:01 2015 UTC,i lived in Calgary Mountain View for over 20 years until just before this election. I think I can honestly say most people vote for David Swann because he's an excellent MLA and not for his party.

He can't simply exist as a red-tinged NDP MLA, he also has to advance the Liberal agenda as the only liberal member of the legislature.

alberta,35j2vs,ModoReese,2,Mon May 11 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think in that sense he's answering not to the constituents of Mountain View, but to the provincial Liberals as a whole. I honestly believe Swann could have pulled a Blakeman and ran under multiple banners and still easily won, but there's a reason he didn't do that.  My impression is very similar to yours -- Swann is winding down his career. Where that leaves the Liberals, I have no idea, but Swann is not the guy to lead them."

As far as rebuilding the ALP goes, they've got four years - seems unlikely that Swann would still want to be the leader 4 years from now, so this would just force the issue, and would be a nice feather in his cap."

I can see her giving Seniors to someone with no experience so they could learn before taking on one of the larger portfolios. There's also a ton of nurses and healthcare workers from all around the province, so she may leverage the position for regional balance."
alberta,35j2vs,navi_is_dead,3,Mon May 11 04:44:11 2015 UTC,"I think Richard Feehan would also be a suitable candidate for Advanced Education as he is a former University Instructor and academic. There was another University Instructor elected though wasn't there? Joe Ceci also has experience in Social Work I believe, but Municipal Affairs makes the most sense for him. Also, David Shepherd would be fitting for the role of Minister of Culture as he has a background in audio engineering/production and is really smart with the media. Eggen or Dr. Bob is a tough choice for health, but there is a Ministry for Seniors which was formally part of the Ministry of Health which would make sense for Dr. Bob."
alberta,35j2vs,Jyth,2,Mon May 11 02:08:18 2015 UTC,Giving Advanced Education to Richard Feehan would be a great way for him to earn experience in the cabinet before potentially taking on Human Services in the future

alberta,35j2vs,Baba_YaYa,3,Mon May 11 03:16:08 2015 UTC,That's why I am guessing Advanced Education will be given it's own portfolio and as such anybody with experience dealing with post secondary and the bureaucracies there would be qualified for the position.

Not to mention giving a Liberal that kind of power would be a big middle finger to right wing voters in Alberta, and Notley needs to avoid that battle until she has her ducks in order. Swann is a Liberal, and the hard core base of the ALP would not want to lose their only voice in the legislature to a position that wouldn't do anything towards the rebuilding the party. I know generally Alberta Liberals are regarded as a lost cause, but there are some real hard core believers in that party. Would Swann want to be muzzled? Is he a true party man?   Mason is the obvious choice, even though it will make for a less experienced cabinet. This is going to be a top-down administration, so Mason's experience would be way more valuable as Speaker than as another minister who was working from the party script. Plus he's not getting any younger, and giving less-well-known newcomers a chance to get some name recognition is important for the future of the party."

alberta,35ibiw,Freedosmay,6,Sun May 10 17:34:02 2015 UTC,You have to understand Alberta is currently in a localized recession and most industries here are not looking to hire. Those who are have tens of thousands of unemployed oil workers to choose from.  The City of Edmonton is almost always looking for employees and they pay well enough for you to move here. City of Calgary doesn't hire nearly as many people as Edmonton but you can try there as well.  Otherwise I would say hold off and watch the price of oil. Either this fall or next (most likely next). When oil gets back up to 80-90-100$ a barrel you'll have a much better chance finding work in this province.

alberta,35emsh,Shoelucky,3,Sat May 9 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"there's also the individual vs group effect. From an individual level, based on reviewing the NDP platform and listening to Notley's comments re: pipeline projects, I'm certain the potential of my job disappearing has increased substantially over the past week. Looking around the current calgary market, I'm also relatively certain that if I do get laid off, I will be unemployed for an extended period and possibly forced to move.  I'm not shouting my concerns from the rooftops, but as a single income family, we're definitely on defence, reducing any variable household costs, cutting planned major expenditures and funnelling as much as we can to the emergency fund.  I know if everyone takes the same tactic, a downturn will be the inevitable effect, but at the same time, I need to protect my family first. I'm hoping optimistic NDP supporters are spending like mad to make up for curmudgeons like me."
alberta,35emsh,weecdngeer,2,Mon May 11 03:15:39 2015 UTC,"Patience is easy at an individual level, and it's not fair to assume anything as the NDP hasn't had a chance to make any changes yet or prove themselves. However from the perspective of a company you have to plan 2-3 years ahead, and for oil sands guys 10+. Uncertainty makes it very hard to do this, so I think a certain level of fear is reasonable. The royalty review committee is supposed to deliver recommendations in 6 months. Not long for us, but if you need to make a decision as a company (mb a new acquisition, selling, where you want to allocate your capital) waiting 6 months is a long time."
alberta,35emsh,Xeronian,9,Sun May 10 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"Conservative supporters are allowing their disappointment of the election outcome to be leveraged by those who agitate for fun or their own agendas.     Somehow they need to take a step back and allow for some time to pass and then make their own judgment of the new NDP government. Unfortunately, short of a complete withdrawal from (social) media, that is difficult to do.    Consider the source citizens of Alberta. Remember that all of the major newspapers of the province endorsed the PC's at the direction of their ownership. Business/financial news sources have similar ownership interests. They are all clinging to what has worked for the past 44 years: using threats and manipulation to influence policy. It causes concern because either it will work again (not likely) or when it doesn't they will get extremely agitated act poorly (""rage quit"").    It hasn't even been a week yet so perhaps this will subside. However, there have been ominous signs that conservative voters actually believed the fear-mongering propaganda that Prentice and co subjected us all to. Again, consider the source though: he bailed on his supporters and the people of Alberta when things didn't go his way. He betrayed the trust of those who voted him in. Why would you now trust him or his words on what is best for Alberta?"

alberta,35c76i,the_alberta_way,6,Sat May 9 13:12:11 2015 UTC,The Canadian Taxpayers Federation scam is only interested in winning political points. They know this will never happen.
alberta,35c76i,SurlyMoose,5,Sat May 9 07:57:37 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate? I thought they were a not for profit that focuses on exposing government waste? I kind if agree with the prentice should pay idea rather than taxpayers.
alberta,35c76i,44years,5,Sat May 9 14:16:02 2015 UTC,They are trying to scam you with a populist message. They want you to think they are on your side when they are not. They support policies that are corporate welfare and public-private deals. They have no right to call themselves non-partisan. They're cowards who won't admit who they really support (LPC).
alberta,35d90s,Dzingel43,12,Sat May 9 04:51:57 2015 UTC,Prentice and appointed Ministers remain in their positions until the swearing in ceremony.
alberta,35d90s,banjoman74,7,Sat May 9 05:06:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting question. I think he resigned as leader and as MLA, but he did not resign as premier. There is precedent in that quite often the sitting Speaker does not run again in an election, but remains Speaker until a new one is chosen. In Saskatchewan there was a Speaker who continued to serve for several months until the new Speaker was chosen. He was not paid his MLA salary but did continue to receive his extra Speaker pay.  So I expect Jim Prentice is still the Premier."
alberta,35d90s,cisco45,2,Sat May 9 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"Or in short, he still is on the payroll."
alberta,35d90s,Crowned_Son_of_Fire,3,Sat May 9 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Partially yes. He won't receive the MLA portion, but will receive the extra money the Premier receives. But only until Rachel Notley is sworn in."
alberta,35d90s,cisco45,3,Sat May 9 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"How long does it take to form government?  When I get a new job, I usually show up the next morning.  I know this is more complicated, but can someone explain how much more?"
alberta,35d90s,redditmoose,9,Sat May 9 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"Generally it takes about two weeks. But that's not set in stone.  Alberta doesn't have a set number of Ministries. So a Premier elect has to look at their caucus, look at their priorities, and determine how many Ministries they want, what those Ministries will be responsible for, and then appoint Ministers for each of those Ministries. Alternately, they may have to look at how many in the caucus can be Ministers (experience, knowledge, or simply how many caucus members they have). Then the number of Ministries are influenced by that.  Those Ministries may also send a picture on priorities of the Government, so it's kind of a big deal.  Alison Redford was elected on April 23 in 2012. On May 8 she announced her Cabinet.   Jim Prentice was elected on September 6, and announced his Cabinet on September 15.  Going back, Peter Lougheed was elected on August 30, 1971. He was sworn in on September 10, 1971."

alberta,35d90s,redditmoose,3,Sat May 9 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"Given how many are rookies, I expect that Rachel will announce a much smaller cabinet than there have been in the recent past. This will give the new people some time to get used to being elected and allow a much smaller transitional team to make any large changes that need to occur in a timely manner. In a year the cabinet will probably be expanded to the normal number."
alberta,35d90s,cisco45,2,Sat May 9 17:44:12 2015 UTC,"That's my thinking. We'll likely see the returning MLAs (Eggen, Bilous and Mason) responsible for more than one ministry. Assuming none of them ends up as speaker."
alberta,35d90s,AntonBanton,2,Sat May 9 20:25:54 2015 UTC,"He resigned as Leader of the PCs and as MLA only. He did not resign as premier, and will not until an hour or two before Notley is sworn in."

NDP were in second place by a ways, but roughly twice as many votes were cast for PC+WRP as for NDP.  His behavior in defeat, his party's collapse, and the tendency for voters to want to be on the winning side might shift a bunch of folks away from the conservative side of the spectrum in the by-election.  But I sure wouldn't want to assume that enough would swing to elect the NDP candidate  - that's a pretty big gap to cross on the spectrum and a lot of votes to move."
alberta,35d87w,LiberalFartsDegree,1 point,Sat May 9 06:55:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, your reasoning is correct, we shouldn't assume that the second place party would win. A lot of people vote for the PCs because of the C part, but don't discount the people who like the P part. It was a marriage of convenience and the only reason it existed was because it was the only way to power for 40 years.  I personally think the brand is done. Some members will drift right and some left. Whether that means WR will get most of the voters is not exactly clear. City folk like more schools, roads, hospitals, etc. I'm not sure rural people realize how much money it takes to provide those services - that's why WR was pretty much shut out of the cities.  Well, it's all speculation right now, but I will be doing my best to stick a fork in the PC party at the byelection."
alberta,35d87w,17to85,1 point,Sun May 10 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"You think rural folk don't need schools roads and hospitals and all that stuff too? Maybe I'm interpreting your comment wrong but it really comes across as ignorant. Maybe try and understand that urban and rural have differing priorities rather than just assuming the country bumpkins don't understand how the world works. As someone who grew up in a rural area trust me, the rural folks roll their eyes at the city folk who don't understand the world too."
alberta,35d87w,GrayBread,3,Sun May 10 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"He resigned before ballots were counted but not before they were cast. The 2nd place finished, NDP, had around 1500 less votes. Thats unfair to 40% of the voters, who voted in favor of the PC party.  By using the same logic, would anyone have a problem if we just awarded the seat to PC and let them fill it with their own candidate?"
alberta,35d87w,Jyth,3,Sat May 9 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"That's one of those slippery kinds of deals because we try to keep political parties out of the system: parties don't make choices, voters and our representatives do. A political party offers up a candidate and says to the voter, ""Hey, this guy has been vetted privately, we think he'll do a good job, and we can make a pretty good promise he'll vote the way his leader tells him to"". You still have to vote him in. And that guy can still, even if he's a WRP member, join another party or sit as an independent or just ignore what their party tells them to do. Anyways, if the party got to choose who filled the seat think of all the interesting issues: like what if a couple of PC people want it? They'd still have do have a vote and follow their internal process but now only people in that party get to choose their representative. And what if the person they choose is just an awful human being? And so on. Cheaper yes, but not democratic.   Plus, his resignation kind of changes the whole political landscape in that riding. There have to be a lot of folks who held their nose and voted for a guy they didn't like but though would probably be premier. Regardless of your political leaning, it's probably pretty nice to have the premier in your riding; now that's off the table, and we since know the NDP is in with a majority, there's a little extra pressure to vote orange."
alberta,35d87w,GrayBread,3,Sat May 9 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. There's no way to solve this issue unless another election is held. I was using my suggestion as a counter solution to what OP suggested, being that they are both undemocratic suggestions."
alberta,35d87w,Crowned_Son_of_Fire,0,Sat May 9 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"By using the same logic, would anyone have a problem if we just awarded the seat to PC and let them fill it with their own candidate?    I think people would have a very HUGE problem with that.  Why? Because while you may think it is the same thing in the end, if a Premier or leader of ANY sorts resigns (Especially as well as Prentice did), their party should never be allowed to refill that seat until a PROPER re-election is held, 4 years later on down the road after the Opposition's have been given a chance to either do good, or prove the naysayers right.  For the record. NDP isn't all bad. Sask had it pretty good until Romanov took the helm."
alberta,35d87w,GrayBread,1 point,Sat May 9 15:44:10 2015 UTC,"I know it would be a huge problem, I was just using it as counter example to OP. The only way to solve this is a by-election."

Alberta has needed change for a long time. I may be living in Sask, but i was born and partially raised in Alberta. During those random years of back and forth, i saw something that maybe a lot of you still don't see yet.  Conservatives were taking you for a spin back then, and still are now. Sure, it may seem like you were getting a good run at times, with all the ""pretty presents"" from big oil and stuff, but in behind the scenes, they were draining away the life savings of a province.   See when people have too much of a good thing, they get greedy and stupid. Conservatives had that for way too long, and now Alberta is paying the price for it. No... that's wrong. Alberta was always paying the price for it. You all just are now starting to have the wool lifted from your eyes.  Is NDP the answer.....?  Maybe not. But since this election ended up with them being the ""winners"", i say let them have a shot at it.   IF that doesn't work, then maybe try another party instead of the same old Jamboree that has come and gone again.  For the record. Alberta has gone from being a have and have not province time and again, because Alberta, like it or not, is easily persuaded into conservative ideals. Not that the liberals are all that much better right now. They aren't. For a few years now.  This time however, the younger generations than even me actually went out and voted. You hold a by-election if you want, but all you are going to do is give the monster who has been practically raping your province another chance to retake the helm.   Alberta is FAR better off with any sort of Conservative leadership. Remember the robo-calls and you tell me if they truly deserve a fair election in the first place, in any riding at all."
alberta,35d87w,GrayBread,0,Sat May 9 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"We're talking about an by-election in a single riding here, not the leadership of the whole province... in the grand scheme it doesn't make a difference. This isn't a debate about who's right for the province I'm just saying that a by-election is the only fair way to solve this issue.  And I don't remember any robo-calls, Prentice came to my door and shook my hand. Regardless of what you think of any party, a fair election is part of the democratic province. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean that they don't deserve it."
alberta,35d87w,44years,1 point,Sat May 9 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"Its worth noting that when you run for office, you have to sign a pledge that states in part that if you win, you will take office.  Prentice did not do that.  some serious rules need to be set regarding freedom of movement re: political office.  Thanks to Prentice specifically, we see that there are loopholes.  A politician voted in who represents one party should not be able to change gears on a whim and cross the floor without constituent approval.  Moreover, he should be financially responsible for literally abandoning the election before the votes were even finished being counted."

The oil industry that represents a huge part of this province has almost no voice in the party, it's up for the companies to fend for themselves. Plenty of nurses and teachers will be heard.

It was a majority vote yet all I hear and see is liberals and conservatives saying good luck to all us NDP supporters now that the party is in power.

As a result, the best political campaign that could possibly be fought in our lifetimes is the action of the NDPs this year.    If they pull out all the stops, you'll see Albertans engaged in democracy, hope will be up, the economy will benefit and we'll all do well.  We can have a serious discussion about our future and moving beyond oil and be ready before it happens.  If the NDP fails Alberta, you'll see Albertans withdraw and the elderly can vote for whomever the fuck, the economy will languish, and when oil falls out again - so will Alberta.

Should we  let portfolio managers dictate our elections and policies? Their sole goal in life is to find the largest return on the dollar which often means seeking out the most exploited market. Similar arguments were made in support of retaining slavery (investment would go to slave countries), blood diamonds, over-fishing, etc.  Yet, we should let their agenda determine how we govern ourselves?  The oil isn't leaving and new investors will move in, seeking this as a buying opportunity where hysterical stock brokers believed the sky was falling. The NDP platform was quite moderate. Very little has changed since Tuesday except management over that resource. Given that, I think this reaction from the financial sector is more a reflection of just how beholden the conservatives were to big business. Now that they can't dictate terms some in that sector are salty like Prentice and want to quit.   Fine. We don't need you.

I think of modern Canadian/Albertan socialism as a commitment to solving the big problems in society collectively; socially rather than individually.   How do we educate children and prepare young people for their careers? We pool tax money together to build schools, hire teachers, and implement a province-wide curriculum. As well, there are 26 publically funded post-secondary institutions in this province and their operating grants under the PC government was around 50% of their budgets: that means that under the PCs you as a taxpayer were already paying a lot for other people's education. Why? Because socialism!  And it's the same with health care. How should we treat people who get sick? Should the rich get to pay their way straight to the head of the line? Should you be on the hook for thousands of dollars because you randomly get sick? No, we have a public system of healthcare that pools our tax dollars and enacts legislation to ensure that very little in that sector is done for profit. Why? Because we're socialists; we were a long before the PCs and we will be long after the NDP.

This job can generally be done without too much bodily harm, however that way is usually slower. You'll often find that the way that could and probably will minorly injure you is the fastest and easiest.  As for long term knee and back ordeals, invest in a kneeling pad asap and use that fucker as often as possible. Concrete is the real killer for the knees. Most people injure their backs either lifting something or struggling with a bolt or fitting that's in there tight. Leverage is key, and you'll learn quickly to lift with your legs. I've found it's usually only slightly less convenient to use equipment to lift most things.   If you are claustrophobic, I'm sorry but you're in the wrong trade. It's pretty much a daily occurrence that I'll be stuffed in some stupid little hole, barely able to fart and trying to undo a fitting that is entirely too tight for its own good.   Now, the good part. This job is not like labor or equipment operating, those jobs are boring as fuck. Every day is a different and more challenging puzzle to work through. My favorite part is diagnosis, to look at a broken machine and figure out exactly what the fuck went on. It satisfies the part of me that took the remote apart when I was a kid, that curiosity and need to know. When you fix something because you knew right away what was wrong, it feels amazing. Plus having an understanding of the inner workings of machinery in general is a godsend for everyday life. To be able to do your own vehicle repairs and maintenance, or make side money doing it for others, it's just easier.   Bottom line, this is a dirty, thankless piece of shit job that can beat the hell out of you. Or, if you play your cards right, have the right attitude and work safely, it can be an extremely rewarding and generally awesome way to make a living."

For a lot of new Canadians, the goal isn't to get a high-paying job for themselves, it's to enable their loved ones to come to Canada, or to afford to put their children through school. Most of the foreigners (immigrants or TFWs, whatever) I've worked with have been tremendously hard-working, because they're not working ""for themselves"", they're working for their loved ones."

alberta,357kgq,sephferguson,2,Mon May 11 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"It's more than just accepting low paying positions.  It's often that education costs put Canadians in levels of debt that foreigners do not have.  How can a Canadian compete with the many millions of qualified professionals around the world that received their education for free, or next to it, in their home country?  Look at the post-secondary education systems of countries like Argentina, Mexico, Poland, and India.   They are either free or very close to it and thus makes it very easy for the citizens from these countries to undercut Canadians as they don't have huge education debts to take care of.  The worst part is that the educations of these foreigners are heavily subsidized by their home countries and we have companies here essentially poaching the investment these nations have made in their own citizens.   So we are depressing the wages of our own citizens while depriving other poorer nations from investments in their own education system by taking their skilled workforce.    It's pretty clear that the only clear winners here are companies that get cheaper labour than they should."
alberta,357kgq,Brunopolis,10,Sun May 10 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's certainly something that needs to be considered.  However, it needs to be considered in the context that the TFWP is constructed to put the majority of power into the hands of the employer and that there have been many examples of this being abused.   It also needs to be considered from the perspective that it intentionally alters the market and has the potential to lower the standard of living of Canadians.  The CPC, lead by an economist from Alberta, certainly knows this and almost certainly approves of this outcome.  In short, the CPC knows that the program can benefit business owners (generally upper-middle and upper class) at the expense of workers (middle and lower class) by creating an underclass of foreign workers that lack the protections granted to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.  If the true concern is the lack of qualified workers, there are ways that the program can maintain the ability to fill unfillable positions while correcting the worst of the abuses.  Despite scandal and questions, this has not happened.  Why?  (P.S.: TFWs usually do know the language well.)  tl;dr: The meme image was created by an ignorant, smug chump."
alberta,357kgq,underwritress,7,Fri May 8 04:46:51 2015 UTC,"Although I see that this was a cross-post this is not the case in Alberta. Skilled labour jobs in skilled trades are being 'imported' such as boilermaker, pipefitter, welder, etc.   These jobs are life-long jobs that require experience and skills. TWF's in these jobs are imported to camps to work the construction projects and are only required until the jobs are complete. After that they take on maintenance roles.  This is not fast food work.   This is skilled labour brought in to complete large projects.   If your are white-collar and think this is beneath you; think again. White collar is actually even easier to replace."

alberta,359902,mrmpr,1 point,Fri May 8 05:34:43 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend doing a Google search (scholarly results would probably be best). It's actually a fairly interesting topic.   Keynesian economics basically says that the budget should be balanced over the total economic cycle (not year to year). In good years, you should run a surplus and spend less. In lean years (such as now) you should run a deficit and spend now (stuff is cheaper, individuals could use the cash).   Keynesian economics is what I personally believe makes most sense, you may find differently. That's where economics becomes a social science."
alberta,359902,mrmpr,2,Fri May 8 06:13:51 2015 UTC,"I believe you dodged the original question good citizen. I am in good faith awaiting a reply to it.   In response to your response one only has to look at the much higher costs of building infrastructure [hospitals, schools, overpasses, etc.] during boom years in Alberta to know that some aspects on Keynesian economics hold true.  One wonders if people would be so opposed to deficit spending with some of the Heritage Trust Fund if it had hundreds of billions of dollars in it instead of its paltry 12 or so billion."

Did we win the first overall draft pick. Did we provide adequate law enforcement.

The public can't understand nuanced perspectives and equate not kicking out a moron who says dumb shit with supporting the moron who says dumb shit.  She simply couldn't separate principles from political compromise. Do you value free speech or want to be equated as a homophobic redneck bigot? Do you value individual discretion for members or arbitrarily enforce a top down power structure that forces everyone to say the same thing?  Politics is not about sticking to nuanced principles because it is too easy for opponents to spin it against you using the group think masses. Danielle never understood that.  People don't want to think for themselves, they want latch on to the most powerful reality available to them. Contradictions to that reality forces them to think critically which causes stress. If you can master packaging a reality that is cohesive and encompassing there is no need for critical thought. Very successful political leaders all have this ability."

I always saw her actions as a vote of confidence for the PC party under Prentice.  She was vehemently against Redford, not the PC platform in its entirety.  The fact that her and seven others felt that they could do more work and more good in the other party was a strong message and one that few heard correctly.   It is a shame that things went the way that they did, with the rural hick attitude towards high level politically calculated actions.  I heard Jim's ""mirror"" comment live and my toes curled.  I knew it would be used against him from then on.  It was also slightly taken out of context but he has too much ego to get stuck in a conversation about what he meant.

I believed then and now that Smith and the floor crosser,s thought they were doing a good thing, but the PC caucus screwed them in the end.  There was about an 8-10 hour period where the crossers announced what they were doing and anything official from Prentice and the caucus.  During that 10 hour period, I would put money on, the caucus and Prentice did not come to an agreement, too late for the WR bunch to go back or Prentice to seal a deal for unification.  The result, some uncomfortable bizarre photo ops and political careers destroyed.  In the end Danielle Smith was the catalyst for the party to build up from nothing.

They're so delusional. It's cute!"
alberta,356d9g,RIFT-VR,36,Thu May 7 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"I'm all for NDP, but I don't think it's fair to call certain rig workers overpaid.  Those guys work fucking hard. 12 hour shifts in the sun. 7 day weeks.  My friend did it for a few months, brought a litre of water with him on the first day, went through it in like an hour, and ended up passing out from heat stroke. Plus there are loads of pinch points where you can easily lose a finger or something.  I've worked lots of manual labour jobs swamping trailers, working in factories, landscaping, lifting and moving shit for 10h+ shifts - I've worked selling beer and facilities jobs cleaning toilets and I didn't get paid anything close to what a rig worker gets paid. But not for a second do I think that rig work is overpaid."

I just think it's an ""easy way out"" for a ton of really, really bad people who don't want to expand their horizons and do it solely for the money, not realizing that the exact same effort they're putting in would get them paid a lot less in a different country/industry.  But this is even better: the guy I was talking about, let me elaborate: he's an ""engineer"" who sits in front of a computer all day making sure a number doesn't go over a certain limit, at which point he calls someone else to fix a problem. Just sits there. Gets overpaid because of the context of the work, not the work itself, which is far from hard work. He's someone who I was very, very glad to see enraged by the progressive tax system."

That's a pretty patronizing thing to say. It's hard and legitimate work, and it's well paid for a reason.  I don't know your friend, and maybe he lucked into a cushy job, but generally if employers figure out that the people they hired don't need to be particularly capable people, or have to work very hard, they find that they find someone else who they can pay much less to do the same work.  For example, in a way, a pilot is just a person that sits in front of a control panel and presses buttons, yet it's actually a fucking hard job in terms of the hours, the time away from their family, plus the investment of their life that the pilot needs to learn to be able to fly the plane.  I ideologically agree with progressive taxes. But I think it's generally not accurate to think that just cus someone else's job seems simple in some regard that they're not worth what their earning, and are inherently lazy or something."

Other people faced the exact same risks, but had to do additional work that I did not have to do.

They make about 40000 / month, but they're gone for 5-6 months at a time and typically don't work more than 8 months / year. They are watching a wide variety of culex physics problems, supervising a crew of 30 people, keeping track of a multimillion dollar budget, tracking materials, dealing with logistical issues, and are on call 24 hours per day. They have extreme liability for an employee, and the worksite they're supervision can  kill everybody in minutes of they make a mistake.

This is objective, irrefutable fact: anyone who is crying their eyes out and stomping their feet about higher income taxes has no argument. If they're in that tax bracket, then the difference between what they were paying and what they're paying now is, unfortunately, a tiny difference that will not affect their quality of life in any way, shape, or form.

alberta,356d9g,Feuersturm-CA,10,Thu May 7 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"Spoken like someone who has never worked up in the oilsands. It is extremely tough work, and for most people work becomes your life. Get off your high-mighty-chair and sit down here for a second.  Many of those who work in camp will work 12 hour days, 14 days in a row. Last year I did 21 days, 5 days off, from January to April. Think about that. No days off during the work period. None. Feeling a bit worn down? You could spend the day in camp where there is #$% all to do but sit in your 7'x10' room (not my video) while one of your coworkers now need to pick up the slack. This is one of the reasons why camp work has one of the lowest rates of absenteeism province wide.  Sit there an imagine how you feel when Friday shows up after your 5 day work week..and then think how that must be to not get that for 2 or 3 whole weeks.  You get up at 4.30am for work. Eat breakfast and start work at 6.00am. You work your 12 hour days (or more, depending on workload and deadlines). Highly likely that your workload will mean your first break is at noon, where you stop for maybe half an hour on lunch if you are lucky. Yes, legally we're supposed to be provided our certain breaks at certain times....but rarely does this actually pan out. Work needs to get done.  The lunches provided? Nothing spectacular. Ham on bread (no butter or lettuce), some fruits or vegetables. Typically plain as to serve all those with allergies or not. Some camps have those Mr. Noodle packs and some cookies and pastries to spice things up. If you are lucky, maybe you beat the other thousand or two camp workers to the hundred or so leftover packages from last night's supper. Other than that...enjoy your plain sandwich. Some days the highlight of my lunch is a small container of plain white rice with some soy sauce in it. If you are way out in the field, forget about warming it up. You eat at your truck.  So now you are back to work, and you work till 6pm. If you find time to take a 15min break in the afternoon, it will be in your work truck if you have one. Otherwise you'll sit your ass on a dirt pile and rest...as it would take 15min to drive on site to your work trailer anyway.  So now you are off at 6pm. You get back to camp at 6.30. Congrats, time for supper. You go stand in line for supper, and get to select from the three different meals today. At least this varies more than the lunches.  You're done eating 7.00 to 7.15. Want to work out? Exercise? IF you want a full 8h sleep that night, you're going straight back to your room and showering. Go for a run? You get a small road ringing the camp to jog on.  Some camps have a bar you can socialize...with your coworkers. Yup, the people you just spent 12 hours working with. Maybe you've got a pool table - but bear in mind there are 1000s of people in this camp also thinking the same thing. Yes, you COULD go to Fort McMurray for a nice meal...if you have a company truck and decide to drive the hour and a half down to Fort McMurray. I'll do this once a shift or so...just to break it up. But you'll be tired the next day.  So back to your room and shower, you're sitting anywhere between 8pm and 10pm depending on your choice. Your room? A 7'x10' room down a hall with 45 other 7'x'10 rooms. You've got a nice 20"" off-brand TV that if you're lucky might have a good cable connection. Have a good night's rest on that mattress that has seen its years and see you at 4.30am the next day.  Now you do that 14 days in a row, without a day off in between. Luckily for  you, after that 14 days you get 7 days off. Congrats you made it! Now go socialize with your friends...who are working in the city for 5 of those 7 days you got off. Dating? Holy fuck good luck finding someone who can stand you being away for two weeks at a time. Maybe you'll get a one-night stand if you flash your money around. Got a family? High chances of ending up separating if you're up here for too many years of that (though some do make it work, but I hear a lot of family struggles with the shift work)  I can understand why he is bitching and moaning. The work up there is mentally tough and straining, and while cushy do-nothing jobs probably do exist...they are vastly in the minority. As in likely 1 / 1000 employees on a site will have that position. And to lose more of that paycheck (which in reality is more of a bribe to keep you in the conditions) really does suck. If he is actually going from 50k taxes to 70k taxes, just imagine how you would feel if the amount taken off in taxes went up 50%  Sorry for the rant, but my blood boils when people who have never been in the industry tell me how easy it is for the money. I don't look down at anyone's job, because I simply don't know what it is like to be in their shoes.  Edit: Added someone's video of a typical camp room"

As I'm sure you're aware, most people's impression of ""oil worker"" = ""rig pig"". The people who do it purely out of greed at a young age and then flaunt the money and behave like they're superior. Money attracts some of the worst people as well, and the vocal minority puts a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths.  Where my bad attitude comes from is my belief that people should build skills in a field they are legitimately and constantly passionate about and find a career there. I know that's not realistic for people in dire situations. But when I see people flocking to something solely for the money, I don't entirely agree with it.  Now, in the case of the guy I mentioned, I should elaborate: he sits in an office and watches a screen all day and barely makes important decisions."

I am looking forward to being back on an 8h day in Edmonton where I can socialize with my friends in the evening...and perhaps get a steady girlfriend again.  I don't flaunt it and rub it in people's faces (or at least try not to). I have absolutely gone there for the money, and the experience - every 10 months I am typically doing work on a different project for different scopes of work. I cannot find that kind of variety anywhere else right now and will help me in future employment.

Clearly these guys haven't considered that (a) they're damned lucky in world-historical terms to end up with such high paying jobs, especially given their comparatively low formal education; (b) that ""deserving"" has been a tricky basis for arguing anything politically for a long time--do the kids who are hungry at school deserve that? Because that's one of the places where these taxes are going; (c) that the job insecurity that they are so worried about was already a feature of Alberta for decades, and that they didn't seem to give a shit about other industries complaints about job insecurity for the past few decades--for fuck's sake, I know a bunch of PhDs who put in their time studying, getting paid poorly or going into debt, only to wind up with rock bottom wages because government policy has shifted to a profit-based model. Of course, such models are the result of PC policies that they supported for years.  Cry me a fuckin' river indeed."

I was beginning to think I was crazy, with the amount of people bitching at me.  They say they're getting paid so well because it's ""hard"" and ""dangerous"". I don't dispute that, but I don't think they realize that those traits make a job undesirable, and much lower-paying in other parts of the world.  But because of our economy, they are fortunate enough to be actually well paid for it, and suddenly the roles are reversed: they believe they're the ones who attained a higher form of employment, because their paycheque seems to tell them so, and they get the biggest ego out of it instead of being thankful.  I do take some solace in the fact that, for the loudmouthed assholes of the bunch, as they age and their bodies disallow them to continue that line of work, that they will realize what a realistic, real-world paycheque looks like, and that will maybe humble them."

Not to mention, while of course anything can happen, NDP have been vocal about acknowledging that the oil industry is the lifeblood of the province. They know full well that hurting the oil industry more than it's already hurting, will do absolutely nothing but spell bad news for the province, the people, and their future in politics here.  Optimistically, they'll go after these wasted positions the Wildrose were talking about in the health and education industries before they start going after oil. Honestly, I'm not even sure if I believe the NDP will even implement any corporate tax increases due to the backlash that was met when Stelmach did it. Politicians say a ton of shit on their campaign, and only make good on a small percentenge of it once elected.  Also, of course oil companies are already coming up with a strategy to move their operations if shit goes south for them. I mean, that's just basic business sense.

Alberta's average private insurance rates are lower then Saskatchewan's public rates, though this doesn't encompass differing factors between the two provinces, or quality of insurance.

The price of our phone and internet plans here are totally out of control and while our phone networks are alright our internet infrastructure is a total mess.   Here in Edmonton Telus and Shaw are the only two options and they often don't even overlap in most areas.  This has left us with two companies not really competing and the result is very expensive plans and terrible speeds.    This is exactly why the city of Olds got together and made their own ISP boasting Google fiber speeds (10X faster then shaw and telus) for around the same price.
alberta,358zlo,ApoliticalypseNow,0,Sat May 9 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"Red Deer College privatized their bookstore during the last round of cuts to get a bit of cash (well, a million I think) to do some much needed remodeling to the main hallway and save on staffing costs. The bookstore used to be unionized and employed some really great, experienced folks; now they seem underpaid, overworked, and the union people that were let go got pretty decent termination settlements from the taxpayers. We now have a major American publisher (Follett) ripping students off (well, all bookstores rip students off, but at least before any profit stayed with the College). They giving all-round poor service because they're understaffed and have had like 5 different mangers since the switch. Also, they do some questionable things with stocking merchandise, like they just brought in a bunch of sexy Betty Boop stuff--if you know any nursing professionals you can guess how well our nursing department took that!  So yeah, there's some weird and nasty privatization that's been done under the PCs on some pretty local levels should be reversed or put a stop too. I mean the talk in post-secondary during this budget has been the need to switch to a model that's more self-reliant, to generate some kind of revenue so that we don't take so much taxpayer money: post-secondary institutions typically operate at around 50% of their budgets from provincial grants. If the PCs had been elected, I think RDC would have privatized their daycare centre to a for-profit agency and whatever other departments they could think of to make a buck. I suspect the NDP won't touch the big stuff that's been somewhat successfully privatized, but I'm sure there are tons of little things like this they can step in and fix."

Since the infrastructure is not duplicated across companies (all the gas companies share the pipes, all the power companies share the lines) it might be possible.  I think that the (land line) telephone company ship has sailed and I'm not convinced that we could re-privatize that.  We could introduce a government player in the cell phone market though, like Saskatchewan's SaskTel.

Companies do not dictate their own social responsibilities - not anymore. They are expected to be responsible and mature entities in a complex, tolerant and open society.

alberta,359e3d,windexEnthusiast,3,Fri May 8 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"I work in tax, still finishing the school to be an accountant though. To keep things simple, think of a royalty as a tax on revenue or units produced. This is different from income tax which is a tax on profit. A royalty will increase the required break even point."
alberta,359e3d,manamal,0,Fri May 8 05:38:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input, that makes sense. Taking a cut from their bottom line and then off their profit? No wonder why corporations are so pissed."
alberta,359e3d,JeffBoner,2,Fri May 8 20:05:44 2015 UTC,This isn't really anything to do with taxes. Royalty's are a sliding scale dependent on prices.   In this case Crescent Point is basically making an idle threat. If they can so easily switch their spending between either province's leases they hold then the returns are either equal or they don't care (unlikely) or this is an idle threat. My guess is the latter.

alberta,359e3d,trasie,2,Fri May 8 06:09:08 2015 UTC,"The NDP are proposing a collaborative approach to resource development, but they are also saying that they lead the collaboration and that the outcome needs to be positive for Albertans. So if companies aren't willing to collaborate they should leave, or they'll just stall/derail the process.  That being said, there is still a (justifiable) fear that if too many companies leave we will be in a bad (worse?) financial position. So it makes sense that we start looking for and pushing other economic pieces that can help to fill some of the gaps. For example, right now I'm really excited about the investment potential of Opportunity Development Cooperatives which would keep much more of people's RRSP money in the province and make it usable by local businesses."

They have the backing of a large group of (mostly) talented professionals who have interacted with stakeholders from municipalities to industry and all the little people in between. A deputy minister  provides insight and advice to a Minister which is free to ignore it.  I'm not OP, but I'd go with Mr. Dang after hearing him on the CBC, seems sharp."

The reality is we are in a tight economic position and scaring the crap out of the energy sector does no one any good.   The energy sector is a vast amount of people in this province and finding someone with experience that supports the NDP wont be extremely difficult. It might not be the dominant view by any stretch but not everyone in the industry disagrees with the NDP, even on topics like the royalty review. However it will show the industry at large that she is willing to give them a seat at the table and ease a lot of people extremely worried about the lack of experience in the party."

alberta,357gfl,Loire55,4,Thu May 7 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"Well our energy industry can't feasibly be carbon negative by very nature and we can't exactly turn it off tomorow.  But otherwise we agree in principle, big industry needs to face regulations that promote innovation towards environmental neutrality, some of which they do (water recycling and returning lease sites to their natural state) while many of them they don't.  Where we differ is on who is the correct person for the job. If you put somebody up, like your suggested candidate, who has a history of being completely anti-drilling nothing will get done because they will be actively combative and antagonistic. In  arguments/debates open combative stances usually do more harm then good and causes parties to shut down.   We need someone who will finesse the situation."

These are our industry and yes we have to keep them accountable just as we do our government, but we have to respect the fact that they make jobs and bring money to fund cleaner ideas, improvements, and optimizations in the energy sector.

If by posting here I can pass along/ and receive information that I otherwise wouldn't have access too then I am going to continue.  The beauty about a democracy is it usually creates a great forum for discussion. I am learning a ton engaging with far left and moderate left supporters. By down voting to create only one predominant opinion helps no one.   I strongly believe that access to information is the key to a successful society and I will continue to do my part, even if I'm near the bottom of these subs."

(Sorry, not sure how to put in proper spoiler formatting):  For those who haven't watched this, this scene is where the Russians have surrounded Berlin and the commanders are trying to inform Hitler of the situation (which is hopeless). Hitler directs his generals to move troops to block and break out of the encirclement, only to be told that several army groups (that he has specifically mentioned) have either surrendered or have been destroyed.  Hitler goes on a rant about how he is surrounded by traitors and incompetents. Also, he is resigned to Germany's destruction - he ties Germany's fate to his personal survival - dooming ordinary Germans to whatever follows.  The movie made me sympathize with Hitler, but it definitely highlighted the height of his delusions by the end of the war. I would absolutely recommend it, if you don't mind subtitles."

alberta,356yzq,Kaelteth,5,Thu May 7 17:20:44 2015 UTC,looking on Canada job bank the lowest starting mcdonalds i see is 11.65 an hour in edmonton with others listed at 12 an hour for a the same counter attendant position  13.75 to 15.00 for supervisors across alberta.  so a bit less of an increase but still an increase
alberta,356yzq,alpain,7,Thu May 7 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it IS an increase.  But if this is driving restaurants out of business, methinks they weren't very financially stable in the first place."
alberta,356yzq,Kaelteth,4,Thu May 7 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"ya, just saying its less of an increase than your assumption, so its not even as high as your estimate guesses.  pretty sure tim hortons as well pays over minimum wage currently, sometimes even profit sharing in some locations."
alberta,356yzq,alpain,4,Thu May 7 19:00:54 2015 UTC,Profit sharing!! OMG SOCIALISM!!!!!!  BURN TIMMIES TO THE GROUND!  OR ELSE HITLER WILL RISE FROM THE GRAVE TO RULE US ALL!!!  hehehehehehe
alberta,356yzq,Kaelteth,2,Thu May 7 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"Fast food restaurants typically have pretty low profit margins and cut costs however they can to increase those margins (like almost every business). Increases in wages absolutely could rock the boat and cause trouble generating profits. This isn't a fault of the business, it was operating as efficiently as possible in its current market.   Generally, when faced with these kinds of increases, businesses choose to either: shut down, increase prices, or cut costs."
alberta,356yzq,Kadem2,5,Thu May 7 22:40:53 2015 UTC,So you missed or ignored the point that it would cost the average customer $0.64 more than today to have a livible-ish minimum wage.  Sixty-four cents.
alberta,356yzq,Kaelteth,1 point,Thu May 7 23:07:02 2015 UTC,At McDonalds. What about local restaurants?
alberta,356yzq,steel_shot,1 point,Fri May 8 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"Harder to estimate...are the breakfast/lunch/dinner, lunch/dinner or just dinner?  I'm going to consider this under the guise of my local little bistro.  Lunch/dinner only.  He operates from 9am (coffee crowd) to 9pm, so a 12 hour day.  He has one staff beside himself at all times outside of peak, so that one staff is an extra $57.60 a day.  Then for lunch and supper, he has one additional staff member there.  2.5 hours each rush, 2x per day, so another 5 hours of wages...an additional $24 per day.  $81.60/day in additional staffing costs.  He probably sees 50 customers at each of lunch and dinner.  I'm not counting the coffee crown customers.  So 100 plates served a day.  That works out to $0.82 per plate to pass on to the customer.  Very modest.  But that's a small place....I do not have familiarity with the big fancy joints, but I would venture that they can handle it too if their restaurant is healthy.  Yes, this will kill some restaurants, but they were likely bleeding money (or close to) already, and would have died anyway.  The minimum wage becomes a convenient excuse."
alberta,356yzq,Kaelteth,1 point,Fri May 8 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"I don't want to say too much but this is from a close family member's large restaurant(s). It ends up being around a 5-10% increase in total costs, which destroys the margins. This is the case for any business except a few (apple is a good example). Their restaurants will be fine but there's going to be a touch adjustment.  Prices will definitely need to be raised everywhere but this can also have a negative effect on total revenues.  The bistro isn't as bad since the owner can be there all day, this isn't always the case."
alberta,356yzq,steel_shot,1 point,Fri May 8 13:02:40 2015 UTC,It's not just minumum wage workers that get a wage increase. All people making less than $15 get an increase. Now the manager who is making $14-16 per hour wants more because why should they be getting minum wage? Now they want $18-20 an hour. So now everyone working there is getting more.  This is not just for restaurants. Someone who is making $18 an hour currently has a certain purchasing power. You just killed it with raising minimum wage to almost that level across all sectors. All this does is kill the middle class while making everything cost more for eceryone.

Sure, there's no jobs because businesses are shutting down everywhere, but at least we know now which ones had the highest profit margins. No one is made better off except for the lucky few workers who won the lottery of getting a job, but we can thank the government for telling us which businesses are worthy of existing."

Good incentive.” We are absolutely talking about buying a car in this thread and the government rebates associated with it.  “ I'd much rather subsidize people driving electric cars than subsidize the oil industry.” That’s great, I have no problem with you giving as much of your money as you want to people who want to buy electric vehicles, please do so. However, I think you probably mean you would rather EVERYBODY subsidize people wishing to purchase these personal vehicles. Why? And you never answered, do you mind subsidizing my new television purchase? What else should the Gov’t subsidize? My neighbour whet to an environmentally friendly lawn, should we subsidize him as well? Who should decide which items should get subsidy and which should not? Please don’t say politicians as they are just like everybody else and would look out for their own interests first.  “subsidize the oil industry”-I’m quite curious, how do you think the Oil patch is subsidized by the Gov’t? do you believe that the Gov’t writes them cheques to drill? There are times and places where there are reduced royalty rates to encourage investment by making it economically feasible to drill wells thus providing a much bigger economic impact. And to be honest I’m not really a big fan of those either but the cost\benefit has shown to work.  Again this just is another example of someone who wants someone else to pay for their pet project, in this case it’s EV cars.

alberta,352y0e,57Chewie,1 point,Thu May 7 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"I absolutely did not vote NDP. I am in favour of the government subsidizing any purchases that decrease the emission of carbon into the atmosphere.  Mostly in the form of a tax break either at purchase or at the end of the year on income tax in the form of a rebate.  So if that's your TV, great.  If that's someone's electric car, even better.  We simply cannot continue to pump as much carbon into the atmosphere as we are and have been. The oil industry receives subsidies in the form of super-low income tax and super-low royalties.  This simply cannot be allowed to continue."
alberta,352y0e,enigmakahn,2,Thu May 7 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"1) Fair Enough, good thing I don't go to Vegas much. 2)  Seems like that would require a great deal of revenue. Mind telling me what marginal tax rate you would be personally willing to pay?  3) Please Define ""super-low"". is this something you actual know and understand or just regurgitate the 'We should be like Norway!!'. Please pick a basin that has characteristics such as the WCSB where it's extremely expensive to drill and complete wells and compare their royalty rates to AB's. Please tell me what we could increase the rates to and still drill wells with a realistic ROI.   My personal opinion is that the Gov't and industry have struck a pretty good balance where industry provides about 9-10 B a year in direct payments to the province plus a huge boost in employment and other economic factors.   If you TRULY believed in your cause you wouldn't need government subsidies to do all of those things and you would buck up and pay for it yourself."

This is for corporations making more than a half million a year in PROFIT.  And the tax is only on profits.  A new Job Creation Grant is going to come into play to help offset this increase.  The highest earners among us ($125,000 and above per year) are going to see tax increases.  Everyone else will stay the same or reduce.  The health care tax levy is gone.

A jump in minimum wage and corporate tax rates will probably cause prices to shift as corporations recoup their losses.

The new wave of Dippers elected federally in 2011 posed the same kind of questions about 'qualifications' and 'seriousness,' and almost universally they've taken the job seriously and some of their youngest MPs (of which they have 19 of the 20 youngest members in the HoC) have shone the brightest in the four years in the official opposition. Even Ruth-Ellen Brosseau (Hey there Deborah Drever,) of the infamous Vegas trip is a valuable member of the shadow cabinet.  Not that it guarantees success.

alberta,350poz,RegularMario,15,Wed May 6 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"First past the post. Meaning that each riding only has one winner, despite them often getting only 30-40% of the vote. Proportional representation is a system where seats are assigned proportionally based on total vote share. In a simplistic example, it would mean that if NDP's got 45% of the votes, they get 45% of the seats. If the Green party gets 1% of the vote, they still get 1% of the seats.   I'm a supporter of proportional representation because it massively decreases the importance of strategic voting and allows niche parties to establish themselves much easier. This election I saw so many ""A vote for XYZ party is a total waste in this riding"" posts. In proportional representation, no vote is a waste."
alberta,350poz,northernswagger,9,Wed May 6 15:06:21 2015 UTC,"It also kills rural representation, since their ridings have far fewer population (which is how the Wildrose won so many seats)."
alberta,350poz,brningpyre,7,Wed May 6 15:33:09 2015 UTC,What do you think a fair solution for that is?  Should a small number of people really be able to put up a huge number of seats?
alberta,350poz,themaincop,4,Wed May 6 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"They don't though. Just Calgary and Edmonton have more than 50% of the seats. Central Alberta which includes Camrose, Cold Lake, Lacombe, Wetaskiwin, and many small towns has less seats than Edmonton alone. Just look at the election map, until you zoom into Edmonton, it looks more than half Wild Rose when they really only got 20 seats compared to the NDP 54. If Rural Alberta really had too many seats it would be nowhere close to as much of an NDP blowout."
alberta,350poz,GarryGarryson,3,Wed May 6 17:51:57 2015 UTC,So then how would proportional kill rural representation?
alberta,350poz,themaincop,2,Wed May 6 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"As few seats as they have compared to the cities right now, they'd have even fewer with proportional representation..."
alberta,350poz,themaincop,1 point,Wed May 6 19:28:35 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it balance out because the urbanites voting for rural-friendly parties wouldn't have their votes canceled?  Basically it moves to a system where every vote counts towards the overall makeup of the government instead of your vote only counting towards your riding.
alberta,350poz,GarryGarryson,1 point,Wed May 6 20:46:45 2015 UTC,"FPTP allows for a representative(MLA) for an electoral division. Chances are you didn't vote for Notely but the NDP constituent in your area (or whichever party leader and party you voted for). This add's accountability to your elected representative as they were elected specifically from your electoral division.  Whomever had the most votes in your area was elected to represent said area on a provincial level, whomever came second, third, or in any other position does not get to represent your electoral division. The person with the most votes get's the seat. The party with the most seats win either a minority or majority in the province.   This is why there is typically a divide between urban and rural party election seat numbers.   How would proportional representation assign representatives to rural areas? Even now the Rural vote doesn't really have that much of an effect even though the individual rural votes have more weight. With proportional representation why would a candidate even care about these voters when you can get an even greater (than FPTP) majority from two cities?"
alberta,350poz,brningpyre,1 point,Wed May 6 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it at all, I'm in favour of lowering rural representation. The PCs set up those rural ridings so that they'd be over-represented in there."

They lucked out and the system happened to work for them this time.  Maybe they implement proportional representation and it goes against them next election, that may be the case, but they can't just leave it how it is because it worked this time. A lot of the population voted right wing, and they as much as I dislike it, they deserve to be represented fairly as well.  It's time to stop worrying about strategic voting and let people vote for what they actually believe in. Election reform should be the number one issue because it's time that people were educated about it and we need to be thinking long term."

alberta,350poz,095179005,1 point,Wed May 6 15:26:13 2015 UTC,"With these alternative voting systems, they counter what FPTP does.   FPTP guarantees a tyranny of the majority. In every election, more candidates vote against the winner than for the winner. Sure they get 40% of the vote, but 60% wanted someone else.   Where is their representation?   In CGP Grey's video (link provided by /u/Haxim), he shows how ridingless candidates are held accountable. Within the party, they choose who should be in those extra seats. Any misbehaving member can easily be knocked down the totem pole.   Whether as a policy you can just boot someone out of legislature remains to be seen. One reform I would like is for MLAs to be able to be recalled by there constituents at any time, and not to mention the age old mandatory voting.  In terms of local representation, we would have to change how anonymous votes are (maybe?). With the popular vote, you could assign an x number of people who voted for that party to be represented by a party member."

alberta,350poz,095179005,0,Wed May 6 18:54:18 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from.  What I want is a representative government, that reflects how the population votes/feels in terms of party affiliation. It's an ideal that I base off of consensus democracy, and one that might not be practical in this point in time.   From what I've seen MLAs don't really mean anything, it's the flag they fly under.

IMO the greatest political achievement in this Country's history was the patriation of the Constitution and proclamation of the Charter by Trudeau's majority Liberal government. Minority governments have managed to get things accomplished also:  Pearson's passage of Universal Health Care. All done on FPTP.  I will keep an open mind and consider other options as we have discussions on electoral reform as it is a healthy thing to consider.

The current system is set up such that each riding is electing a representative to the legislature, to represent the will of the people in that riding.  This is the argument with crossing the floor, you elected the rep, not the party, so they can change parties if they see that way better represents their constituents.  So if we go with proportional representation, and the proportion dictates that a person from a party that did not win in my riding gets picked to represent us, who are they actually representing?  It would seem that representing their party is their actual job, and not representing me.  If we address that by going to a riding-less system, then there is no one to represent the unique concerns of my riding, and I am far worse off than before.  Every way that we might select representatives has its issues, and we have to work within those issues to make sure that we get represented properly.

alberta,3536v8,BoomFapXCX,7,Wed May 6 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"IF the tax/royalties/etc suddenly became non-competitive in Alberta comparatively, it could cause the energy sector to stop investing in Alberta until the tax environment changes.  Not that they won't come back, but it could slow investment.  The thing is, for all the doomsayers this morning, the proposal by the NDP (at least on paper) still leaves Alberta with a tax advantage over every other province.  The only way they actually move out is if moving out saves an asspile of money, and if the advantage is still Alberta's, they don't make more money moving.  So realistically, expect no real change in Alberta other than corporate profits coming down a few points.  If anything, the ""selloff"" on the TSX today is entirely expected...if the profit of the energy sector is going to be down 2-3%, then a 3-4% drop in their stock price is entirely expected and appropriate in the economy.  Again, the sky is not falling, and these companies are fine."
alberta,3536v8,Kaelteth,3,Wed May 6 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Corporate taxes and royalties are two VERY different things.  If only the Corporate tax rate changes you will see little effect in the patch, assuming it’s only the couple points mentioned. However, if the Royalty rates are changed significantly you would see consequences.  O&G companies would not ‘Move’ per se they would move their Capital spending to other plays with more economic returns. i.e. SK, ND, TX etc"
alberta,3536v8,57Chewie,2,Wed May 6 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"You are of course assuming that a royalty review and the changes (if any) would make us noncompetitive compared to other areas.  If we're competitive, the O&G sector is fine and dandy and won't go anywhere."

If I have 10 million to drill a well in northern Alberta and I'm projecting a net back that's narrow at current royalty rates, I will hold off spending until I know what the rates are going to be. That 10 million would have employed construction workers, rig crews, Frac crews (speaking of, I now also have no idea if I  will be able to extract the resource because ban fracs), hoteliers, grocers, restauranteurs, highway crews, transport workers etc. now imagine everybody is going to hold off. That's a full year of no spending, or minimal spending, because margins are tight right now and we don't know if we're going to see rate increases or not. Uncertainty kills business."

The voters chose NDP out of spite and no other alternative, not for the platform they ran on. People heard they will get more money so that's another reason they voted NDP.

I feel drug tests will help make sure funds are allocated properly. That's my personal opinion and may not reflect the majority but it's how I feel. NDP fucked over Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Now it's our turn."
alberta,350ulq,Kaelteth,22,Wed May 6 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"This is going to fuck our economy.   No, it's not.  First of all, in bad economic times, spending = good.  Trickle-down effect and all that.  Social programs = more jobs.  More jobs = more spending, plus more people employed is subjectively a good thing.  Furthermore, debt is dirt cheap right now.  Best time in decades for the government to borrow.    As for the NDP's actual platform, they're focused on diversifying the economy and increasing our refining capacity.  That's a pretty damn 'conservative' economic policy.  The Alberta NDPs are kind of a centrist party these days, hardly the socialist/unionist/communist party they're made out to be."
alberta,350ulq,xposureZILLA,-1,Wed May 6 17:05:26 2015 UTC,First off more social program spending equals more jobs that the tax payer pays for.

alberta,350ulq,Kaelteth,1 point,Wed May 6 15:20:38 2015 UTC,So short sighted.  Do realize that these people with these jobs mean that more people will be spending money at businesses which mean more hiring at those businesses.
alberta,350ulq,TURBOJUGGED,-1,Wed May 6 15:29:10 2015 UTC,Debt is good? Why get yourself in a hole you have to dig yourself out of? Why not just spend within our means? Spend smarter. Audit spending in programs to see where exactly the money goes.
alberta,350ulq,C_Flex,7,Wed May 6 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Debt is good when it is smart debt.  Right now, the cost of borrowing is effectively lower than the cost of inflation, especially with all the job losses/etc in the construction and oil industries.  The cost of doing the project today, plus the debt servicing costs, is lower than the cost would be if you waited to save up to do the work."
alberta,350ulq,bryjow123,5,Wed May 6 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way:  if you want to buy a house, go to school, and maybe start a business you have a few options - you can either save, but you'll be doing that for awhile, or you can borrow.  If you get good enough terms, borrowing will get you ahead in life enough that you can pay it back sooner than you would have saved it, all while making more money and having a house."
alberta,350ulq,C_Flex,-2,Wed May 6 13:32:04 2015 UTC,And what if instead of making payments you spend it on furniture and travelling? What if you can't keep up with payments or the economy is bad and you lose your business? How to you pay off your debt?
alberta,350ulq,turudd,5,Wed May 6 15:15:25 2015 UTC,"What if you can't keep up with payments or the economy is bad and you lose your business?   The point of the analogy is that governments can influence the economy.  A government borrows, they have enough power to actually help the economy overall.    Anyhow, how do people pay off mortgages?  Part of the equation is the fact that, on a long-term loan, the value of the loan goes down over time due to inflation.  If you get low enough rates, the burden is nil.    Think of it like this: a government that never borrows is like the high-school grad who goes to work right away, pounds pavement, then saves his pennies.  A government that borrows is like a kid that gets a student loan to go to college, then makes twice as much as the other kid.  Who's going to be ahead in 50 years?  And while college isn't always a sure bet in my analogy, governments, like I said, can actually change the system, and ensure a return on investment."

Don't fucking jump to extremes either such as cancer treatment. I watched my father suffer through cancer treatment so don't you fucking dare act like I can't relate.  There are good social programs and bad ones. Would you want your money wasted on a couple of alcoholics where the money they get each month doesn't go to providing for their children but to fund their casino nights, smokes and booze? I've only seen about 1000 examples of that. Why are the children allowed to suffer because the parents can spend it where ever they want? Should we not be trying to create a program that requires proper spending? Do something like for insurance fraud where not everyone gets audited, only the ones that raises flags. Creating these auditor positions would increase jobs and also ideally control wasteful spending. That's a win/win."
alberta,350ulq,Jabberwocky13,7,Wed May 6 15:15:41 2015 UTC,Provincial social programs do not go directly to families. They go to services. Meaning that your point in your last half of your comment was unfeasible. That was what my comment meant.
alberta,350ulq,drays,-3,Wed May 6 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"That's fine. Support programs are important. My main concern is the lackadaisical attitude towards debt. It's not a ""we'll worry about it later"" issue. Say we get a 100,000,000$ debt. To pay it off we need a surplus of 100,000,000$ plus whatever interest is. If a government has a surplus one year, they are unlikely to save it for later like we have done in the past. I feel like any surplus the NDP gets will go to more spending and not actually towards paying off debt. I'm thinking of give someone who maxed out a 10,000$ limit on a credit card and give them a prepaid card with10,000$. Instead of using it to pay off the debt, they'll likely continue to spend it. That's how I feel about this situation. I think their budget will be interesting. I hope it will be better than what they've done in Saskatchewan and Manitoba."
alberta,350ulq,Agent47pureaidsrun,2,Wed May 6 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"How about you document the claim that abuse of social programs is actually a major problem? Because I know poor people and social workers, and I see very few undeserving recipients of public aid, and a bunch of deserving people who can't get aid or survive on what they get.  If anything I'd rather see funding going to help the poor than the sick. Spending millions of dollars to ad six miserable weeks to the end of someones life in a cancer ward strikes me as the real waste, and we do that thousands of times a year in our hospitals when we devote huge resources to people with zero chance of recovery."
alberta,350ulq,bubblesqueak,15,Wed May 6 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"Funny part is the drug testing, where its been tried in the USA, has cost more than the savings from revoking benefits to those who test positive. It's not a fiscally conservative policy to make welfare require a drug test.

I'm very saddened that his government also seems intent of screwing up the countries finances with their latest budget, and his complete lack of regard on environmental concerns.  Don't even get me started on the debacles he's been implicated in while his party has been in power (apparently, mr. Harper is quite the control freak, so his excuses of ""I don't know what happened"" are total BS).  Please excuse this rant.... I just really don't like what his government has done for our country. If you want more reasons why, I'd be happy to divulge them. But this has already gone on pretty long....  TL;DR: Harper is terrible for Canada, and the Canadian values I grew up with and believe in."

alberta,350lvd,PolygonMan,-12,Wed May 6 04:08:51 2015 UTC,Still a Socialist party
alberta,350lvd,Flatlander83,17,Wed May 6 06:36:39 2015 UTC,"So, I know that 'Socialism' is a dirty word, and that's fine. The word carries a lot of weight from the 1950's when the US government agencies were using it as a buzz word to round up political dissidents and potential 'revolutionaries', deciding that anything related to the USSR (Socialist being part of the name) was inherently evil and bad. And maybe they were right. Fortunately the USSR wasn't a real socialist state, but rather a Soviet communist state. Unfortunately, the western world saw 'socialist' in the title, and decided that it meant utter complete control by the government and loss of freedoms in favor of state regulation.  The problem with that definition is that it is no longer remotely relevant to the current political scene. Countries that have very openly elected social democrat governments are doing incredibly well; look at basically every Scandinavian country. In fact, look at oil-rich Norway. They have a social democratic government in place, they are making money hand over fist (largely from oil revenue) and there are social programs in place that give everyone in their country the opportunity to live healthy, wealthy lives.  ""Socialism"" comes from 'society'. The idea behind it, as an ideology, is that together we can make 'society' work for everyone, not just the lucky few born into affluence. This is the modern definition. There is evidence that it works. It's not about ceding all power to the state, it's not about the government suddenly owning your privacy (Harper, a conservative, is doing fine enough on that front); instead it's about affordable education, open access to health care, aid for the impoverished through welfare, and economic stimulus to boost the effectiveness of the middle class, growing it at the bottom end, and in turn boosting the power of the economy.  Education is fundamental to this outlook; a better educated society works harder, diversifies the economy on its own (without push from government agency), and reaps all the rewards available to a more technically-inclined workforce, including environmental awareness, industrial sustainability, commerce boons, productivity gains, and on and on. Open access to education by making it more affordable is thus key to a more successful, productive and financially lucrative society, and socialism holds this value at it's ideological foundation.  Access to affordable healthcare is another big deal, which is boosted by the increase in affordable education. Increased levels of quality in healthcare increase the productivity of the populace, which in turn boosts the economy, makes the rich richer, and the poor richer and the middle class richer. Literally everyone wins when everyone is healthier.  The alternative is we keep going the way we're going now, and get left behind by the rest of the world when they advance beyond where we're at. When suddenly the educated workers from Finno-Scandinavia are in high demand and Albertans can't get a job without a degree they can't afford. We get sick and die young because we were too afraid of the T word to consider investing in society.  That's what socialism really is, after all: an economic investment in society."

Due to the extra spending taxes will go up but likely lean more towards wealthy. They aren't anti oil but they're not pro oil. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out with prices the way they are.  It has been shown the PCs are corrupt and since they had been in power so long they seemed to have a sense of entitlement like they're invincible.

I'd be surprised if we didn't see PC voters and politicians leave that party like a sinking ship, though there's still room for Wildrose gaffs to keep people away. If they play it straight and are seen to be tough on the NDP they could sweep up a lot of the right wing support. It'll be up to the NDP not to scare away future voters if they want to hold on"

No party should be in power for that long and, between Redford and Prentice, it was clear that the PCs were out of touch with the reality of the average Albertan. It wouldn't be the worst thing if the PCs learn from this and come back next election humbled and ready to do what it takes to win back the respect of voters.  Until then, fuck them in their pompous entitled asses."
alberta,350lvd,CrazyRightMeow,-4,Wed May 6 06:10:44 2015 UTC,So we have to endure 4 years of a bad economy and idiots having unlimited entitlement. Eh I'd still prefer a slightly out of touch premier.

alberta,350lvd,Tank_Kassadin,1 point,Wed May 6 04:05:00 2015 UTC,I mean with that majority there are obviously A LOT of people out there happy about it. I guess I'm just seeing the vocal minority. In my personal opinion I'm really interested in seeing what the Ndp will do with Alberta. I have some very cautious optimism. A change was definitely needed and I think we can all agree that we are glad to see the Conservatives gone.
alberta,350lvd,CrazyGuyWhoKnows,1 point,Wed May 6 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The only result that would have really pissed me off was another PC majority. Even a PC minority would have sent a clear message that we're starting to get sick of their shit. Even with all the recent polls I never imagined the PCs getting beaten so badly.  Change needed to happen, I didn't even care what kind of change, just any change. (Though a WRP majority might have been a little scary too)"
alberta,350lvd,ZanThrax,2,Wed May 6 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"No kidding, what a night. I honestly expected a PC majority with a strong NDP opposition. I feel like a Wild Rose majority could have been scary but we didn't have a whole lot of other places to turn to. It was either them or the NDP. I think that WR will make a good opposition though."

alberta,350lvd,StraightTalkExpress,4,Wed May 6 05:13:04 2015 UTC,The current oil price isn't just part of the cyclical nature of commodities. It's largely due to manipulation of prices by the Saudis. The PCs could have spent the last 44 years encouraging a more diverse economy. Instead they've been in bed with multinational megacorporations and creating the exact economic situation that Prentice tried to blame the citizens for.
alberta,350lvd,captain_housecoat,1 point,Wed May 6 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that US shale production was the reason that the Saudis were pushing the price down. But if it's the US shale production itself driving the price down, the end result is the same - Alberta's economy is centred around a commodity with a price that is determined entirely by decisions made by countries and corporations outside Alberta."

It adds things like merging onto and exiting freeways, handling heavy traffic and frequent turns and lane changes (if you're in an urban area this usually means a trip downtown). It also adds angle and hill parking (I think hill parking is on the basic test too, but I know I wasn't asked to angle park).  Lastly, they also add controlled and uncontrolled railway intersections. You need to know how to do all of these things correctly.  And of course, you'll get marked down for everything you could get marked down for on the basic test."

alberta,350njx,omguard,1 point,Wed May 6 12:37:02 2015 UTC,He kept his message simple and prevailed. I think he did quite well.
alberta,350njx,manamal,-1,Wed May 6 14:07:45 2015 UTC,He gained more than three the wildrose party lost the floor crossers seats.
alberta,350njx,CannedMango,9,Wed May 6 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"Voted Wildrose. I hope that $#% feels pretty terrible about the results. If anyone deserves it, it is the betrayer herself.  I'm not overly thrilled about an NDP victory (congrats on a good campaign nonetheless!)....so I am putting this squarely on her and Prentice."
alberta,350njx,drays,26,Thu May 7 18:20:24 2015 UTC,I also find it quite satisfying that Mandel got trounced out.
alberta,350njx,manamal,11,Wed May 6 12:46:42 2015 UTC,I also find it quite satisfying that Mandel got trounced out.   Yeah I'm loving that the arrogant asshat Mandel got his ass handed to him as well
alberta,350njx,CannedMango,17,Wed May 6 06:45:04 2015 UTC,Wow he wins his seat and immediately gives it up. That seems really lame to me
alberta,350njx,kailkay,8,Wed May 6 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was pretty much saying, ""I'm only committed to my riding if I am in charge of Alberta, enjoy your by-election!"""
alberta,350njx,Croebh,4,Wed May 6 04:12:35 2015 UTC,"Yup, he's basically saying I was running so I could give handouts to corporate buddies, but actually govern for my riding? What am I, a sucker?  Watch him accept a job in the private sector in 3...2...1..."
alberta,350njx,BoredomFactor,7,Wed May 6 05:47:49 2015 UTC,"This will have lowered his credibility in the private sector considerably. This is far more damning than even Redford, after all she simply got caught doing what all PCs had been doing for decades.  Prentice has displayed bungling incompetence, poor judgement of character, terrible foresight and with his resignation selfishness and a lack of loyalty.  I wouldn't give him a job in the mail room."
alberta,350njx,Think8437,2,Wed May 6 04:05:50 2015 UTC,I actually don't see any problem with somebody going to the private sector when the public sector isn't for them. We can't say to politicians that they must stay in politics forever.
alberta,350njx,kraftdinnereater,2,Wed May 6 05:37:17 2015 UTC,"It's not going back to the private sector that's the problem.  It's when public officials use their position to reward private companies and then take a position with the very company they assisted.  It's a complete batardization of politics.   What's worse in this case, is that he so flagrantly abandoned a position once it was apparent that it wouldn't be able to further his personal ambitions.  As if public office was always a tool for him to appropriate, that had nothing to do with the social responsibilities that the job actually entails."

If they can mirror what has happened in Manitoba we might just be alright.  This election seemed like a 'devil you know, or devil you don't know'. In this case the devil we knew had 44 years to figure shit out and they seemed to be making things only worse through some of the greatest booms Alberta has seen.

Then NDP was voted in and they had enormous debt to deal with. It was so bad conservative had to change their name to Sask Party. I don't understand how so many people think NDP was horrible. They probably weren't the best but in sask conservatives did a pretty piss poor job pre 90s
alberta,350njx,autowikibot,6,Wed May 6 04:14:55 2015 UTC,After looking it up a bit more it appears as you are right. The NDP seem to get voted in just as things are getting bad. Looking at BC it was the Social Credit party that put BC in a bad position and the NDP had to try to clean it up (not to day the NDP didn't have their own faults). In Ontario people blame the NDP but the problems showed up while the Liberals were in power. It appears to me like the NDP are the scapegoat party.
alberta,350njx,Blt2002,2,Wed May 6 04:27:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I've seen about Saskatchewan, too.  Voters react too slowly (not their fault) and by the time they get away from the poor government, it's too late."
alberta,350njx,hykl,1 point,Wed May 6 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"I lived in BC during the NDP years.  I did vote for NDP in Alberta but I do not have fond memories of the BC NDP.  Although they did fight for the people they were not particularly fiscally responsible and ended up rewarding their friends just like any other political party.  They ran up a lot of debt trying to fulfill all of their promises and BC is still dealing with the aftermath.  That said they're the only party willing to raise minimum wage, place meaningful tuition freezes and support unions.  It's a needed change for a while."

If this province is better off in 4 years. (e.g. businesses have not left causing higher unemployment, balanced budgets, thriving economy, emergency room wait times resonable, and small enough class sizes) the NDP will have succeeded and will likely get more years. If not I am positive Alberta will move back to a more fiscally conservative government. I wish Notley the best of luck.

Good luck to the NDP and to all their new MLA's.   Honestly though I can see the PC's going the way that the Liberals have been for the past decade. Slowly devolving into a backseat party. This will give many of the conservative votes to WR. I can see for our next election a good chance for WR as well as NDP.

A party in a first world country that cannot support gay-straight alliances will not find support from new of-age voters. The entire world moves more socially liberal each year and a party that is the most socially conservative in Canada will never gain more support than they have right now.   In addition the inability of Brian Jean to compromise with the NDP on reasonable tax increases will ultimately make him a terrible opposition leader. There will be no compromise he will be willing to reach which means that he will get no say on new legislation.  Yelling at the party in power ""not to do that"" for four years rathering than suggesting a reasonable alternative.   I predict the Wildrose will lose seats every election. Once the more moderate right unites again most of their voters will jump ship. It's unfortunate because they may well have won had they been more social moderate to appeal to more people."
alberta,350yov,ircanadian,1 point,Wed May 6 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree on that. They will have to change or add a few policies including their stance on LGBT matters.   As for Brian Jean, I think he's done alright in the last month he's had to repair damages. Either he'll have to show that he can become a better leader or they will have to find someone who is a bit more charismatic to compromise on certain matters.   Yes the party will have to adopt new policies and they have the next years to get themselves in order. When they do that I can see them gaining more popularity with the centre and centre-right voters."

Corporate taxes/royalties should be raised before anyone even considers raising taxes on Albertans, but there's about a million ways spending should be cut/reorganized first.  Governments should never, ever, spend money on things like ""art"".  Especially when running a deficit!  Imagine if you had a friend, who was out of work and you go over to his house to learn he just bought a $15,000 painting, on his credit card, to hang on the wall.

alberta,350oge,rlyx6x,21,Wed May 6 16:03:50 2015 UTC,"Look I know we all have different circumstances and have different opinions, but is there is there any reason to be a cynical prick? I voted wildrose, and yet I'm not against any NDP voter here."
alberta,350oge,rlyx6x,16,Wed May 6 03:46:07 2015 UTC,I'm actually really interested to see the Wildrose opposition. A strong opposition makes for good government and the WR are certainly very strong in their opinions.
alberta,350oge,tedcorp,10,Wed May 6 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"And I know my opinion is different from a lot of people here, but I wanted the exact opposite with an NDP being opposition. Just because im right winged I guess. I like having minority goverments, holds people accountable, and I guess I just didnt want the PC's to have shit haha."
alberta,350oge,vis_con,2,Wed May 6 03:51:19 2015 UTC,"It'd sure be nice if they knew what they were talking about, though.  Their pie in the sky plans with money saved here and taxes not raised there don't a structured budget make."
alberta,350oge,YoungGunSilver,2,Wed May 6 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that having a strong opposition is healthy and makes for a more thoughtful leader party, but I also have to agree with other comments that a strong opposition in a minority government wouldn't be a bad thing.   The NDP that we've elected are generally pretty green and big time politics, especially in a power province like ours, isn't for.the faint of heart. Sometimes trial by fire is the best way to temper resolve."
alberta,350oge,rodeoboy,14,Wed May 6 05:10:33 2015 UTC,"Nah fuck you, freedom of choice is more important than your opinion, sorry buddy."
alberta,350oge,powermapler,9,Wed May 6 05:41:03 2015 UTC,what is that suppose to mean? You love the NDP as much as you love dicks?
alberta,350oge,WWGFD,7,Wed May 6 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, homophobia and everything. In case you hadn't noticed, Canada's federal government is currently run by a Conservative majority. Conservative =/= Communist."

alberta,353ugq,cmken,6,Wed May 6 21:46:39 2015 UTC,I would say that is just someone over-reacting and saying things that have no basis.  Notley said she supports Energy East.
alberta,353ugq,blowmywhistler,1 point,Wed May 6 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source for that? I think this lady was talking about the Keystone XL pipeline. According to an article this lady shared, Notley is not in support of Enbridge's Northern Gateway and plans to withdraw provincial government support of it. http://www.edmontonjournal.com/touch/story.html?id=11004686"
alberta,353ugq,blowmywhistler,1 point,Wed May 6 22:57:49 2015 UTC,I should have said she believes Energy East has more potential. She has withdrawn provincial financial support for both Northern Gateway and Keystone. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brian-gallant-to-push-energy-east-pipeline-with-rachel-notley-1.3063503
alberta,353ugq,trendless,3,Fri May 8 23:05:49 2015 UTC,Cuz any oil/gas company has ever been known to make decisions that fast... O.o  F.u.d
alberta,353ugq,Kaelteth,3,Wed May 6 23:28:29 2015 UTC,More asshole fearmongering.  Pay no attention to the shitlord behind the curtain.
alberta,353ugq,cchrisgc,0,Wed May 6 22:02:08 2015 UTC,Definitely. I don't know where this lady got this info from...
alberta,353ugq,MrGuttFeeling,3,Wed May 6 22:58:19 2015 UTC,Enbridge Corporate Headquarters are in Calgary. Source: I work for Enbridge.
alberta,353ugq,cchrisgc,1 point,Thu May 7 04:19:56 2015 UTC,Are you moving now?
alberta,353ugq,cchrisgc,1 point,Thu May 7 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"My job is safe as can be. If I was still in the construction side of things, I would be considering it. I think the provincial NDP will play very safe, at least until the federal election is over. Once that happens, they may try to fuck around a bit."
alberta,353ugq,bearkin1,1 point,Thu May 7 20:19:57 2015 UTC,Maybe that's what this lady meant? She told me your head office is moving. Is the corporate office leaving AB because of the NDP?
alberta,353ugq,infernalsatan,2,Thu May 7 20:30:47 2015 UTC,Highly doubt that would be the reason if it was moving. I haven't heard this at all. I find it doubtful since many of the oil companies are based in Calgary. And it probably would coat them a pile of money to do so.
alberta,353ugq,halaakajan,2,Thu May 7 20:32:22 2015 UTC,"It's fearmongering man. No official policy has been stated. And there's no way a major oil company would ever move its headquarters  to Toronto in this day and age unless it's already there. If they moved, it would probably be in the states in Houston."
alberta,350u2y,CyberSunburn,40,Wed May 6 04:04:08 2015 UTC,Such an elitest entitled move by him.
alberta,350u2y,omguard,21,Wed May 6 04:09:17 2015 UTC,"Yup. But he said it during the debate.  He had zero interest in collaborating with anyone. If he isn't calling the shots,  he ain't interested."
alberta,350u2y,rattpoizen,2,Wed May 6 04:18:03 2015 UTC,Does this surprise you?
alberta,350u2y,Necrostopheles,29,Wed May 6 04:58:41 2015 UTC,Appropriate that his last act in politics is to waste more money.
alberta,350u2y,tyl110,24,Wed May 6 04:29:14 2015 UTC,So by-election in Calgary-Foothills and another NDP seat?
alberta,350u2y,SporkOfDestiny,11,Wed May 6 04:07:17 2015 UTC,I think WR has a good chance of picking it up. Most of those 7000 Prentice votes will go WR.
alberta,350u2y,toddgak,9,Wed May 6 04:51:51 2015 UTC,Many will stay home though
alberta,350u2y,nittanylionstorm07,23,Wed May 6 05:43:52 2015 UTC,Telling that his concern was more over power than the people he was supposed to represent
alberta,350u2y,drock45,14,Wed May 6 07:05:36 2015 UTC,What a filthy scumbag. This man has zero scruples. Such a dirty bastard.
alberta,350u2y,Dirtydud,14,Wed May 6 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"What a coward. He doesn't want to act as a representative, he just wants to lead."
alberta,350u2y,BiscottiBloke,14,Wed May 6 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, he was never really serious about governing this province. Premiership was always just a means to an end for him. He wanted to be the next Harper."
alberta,350u2y,JasminefromCanada,10,Wed May 6 04:25:03 2015 UTC,Then thank God Albertans were smart enough to see the wolf in sheep's clothing and vote it out.   Good riddance to bad politics.
alberta,350u2y,vis_con,6,Wed May 6 05:09:55 2015 UTC,here is the article http://www.cbc.ca/news/elections/alberta-votes/jim-prentice-resigns-after-orange-wave-sweeps-alberta-1.3062789
alberta,350u2y,CitizenOwen,11,Wed May 6 05:14:44 2015 UTC,The sad part is he blames the falling oil prices and not his policies or actions.
alberta,350u2y,Necrostopheles,3,Wed May 6 04:39:03 2015 UTC,Which goes to show that they were not looking at the future at all.  Why save money when we've got it literally oozing out of the ground?  When being fiscally conservative is a matter of circumstance rather than solid policy.
alberta,350u2y,CannedMango,2,Wed May 6 04:59:48 2015 UTC,"He did it because there was no way he would remain leader of the party, and wanted to make it look like he left of his own accord."
alberta,350u2y,flamminggecko,1 point,Wed May 6 12:23:31 2015 UTC,Couldn't he have kept his seat of that was the case?  I think he's just a coward.
alberta,350u2y,TLTheDougler,2,Wed May 6 16:25:15 2015 UTC,"Resigning as leader of the party was absolutely the best thing for Prentice to do. He led the party to its worst defeat in 43 years, and if he hadn't resigned as leader his entire party would have demanded his resignation today.  That said, resigning as MLA was a dick move. The only thing he wanted was to lead so he could serve his own self-interest. He should have handled this defeat with dignity, not spite."
alberta,350u2y,vittoriafiori,1 point,Wed May 6 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"Well, what was he supposed to do? PCs would blame him for the failure (almost deservedly so because of the gaffs).  I think of it more like a federalist came to try his luck and got rebuffed by the citizens that seen through the shrewdness. Trying to get a little clever with his debate got him throw on his ass."
alberta,350u2y,satori_moment,1 point,Thu May 7 03:47:14 2015 UTC,He could have kept his seat and done his duty to the people of his riding. He could have gone independent if he wanted.  But that's if he actually cared about alberta and not just himself.
alberta,350u2y,the_kicker,1 point,Wed May 6 12:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure, but realistically what was he supposed to do? Serve as the embarrassed MLA that failed the party?"
alberta,350u2y,satori_moment,1 point,Fri May 22 03:06:15 2015 UTC,"The constituents voted him to represent them, not the PC party. He could have gone independent and represented his riding like a man instead of resigning like a coward."

alberta,350ado,swiftb3,25,Wed May 6 03:55:21 2015 UTC,Both CTV analysts are calling for varying amounts of PC majority...  Edit: can't wait to see them eat crow.
alberta,350ado,nomofica,18,Wed May 6 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"Hahaha PC majority. Ya okay, tell that to the (at current) 53 seats going to NDP."
alberta,350ado,swiftb3,10,Wed May 6 02:39:52 2015 UTC,"""I'm so smart, I'll just ignore all the polls."""
alberta,350ado,nomofica,6,Wed May 6 02:45:07 2015 UTC,Right? I wonder what they're thinking right now...  Probably this.
alberta,350ado,Vladimir_Poonani,23,Wed May 6 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"Holy FUCK boys, this is insane."
alberta,350ado,burritobandito,22,Wed May 6 02:57:27 2015 UTC,and the dude into prostitutes is in the lead. He is in ft mac. No surprise there.
alberta,350ado,starshadowx2,5,Wed May 6 02:12:51 2015 UTC,"Sadly Mike Allen, Don Scott, and Brian Jean are going to get a lot of votes based 100% on popularity. They're all very well known.  EDIT: Well that was an interesting election here in Fort Mac. Wildrose swept the field and took both ridings, but the NDP had a very good showing, even in the lead for a bit. Both PC incumbents have been shown the door."
alberta,350ado,burritobandito,3,Wed May 6 02:41:45 2015 UTC,Not looking good for Jonathan Penis tho
alberta,350ado,nomofica,2,Wed May 6 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"Brian Jean is only leading by 87 votes with only a quarter of the polls being counted so far. NDPs still have a good chance.  edit: lead jumped to almost 300 votes. Still pretty thin margin considering, but trend is in his favour."
alberta,350ado,DieselWeasel131,-1,Wed May 6 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"I hope so, if the NDP win we're in some trouble"
alberta,350ado,nomofica,5,Wed May 6 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misunderstood the initial comments to be discussing Brian Jean's riding (Fort McMurray-Conklin) where he likely will be elected as MLA. Brian Jean and the Wildrose party will not be elected as the Alberta government. Their best case scenario is official opposition. Alberta will be NDP, but it remains to be seen if it will be a majority gov't (although trend shows that is likely)."
alberta,350ado,Strive_for_Altruism,0,Wed May 6 03:24:00 2015 UTC,What do you have against brian jean?
alberta,350ado,starshadowx2,2,Wed May 6 03:21:09 2015 UTC,"When I was a young politically-minded individual I tried to send emails about my opinion and learn more about how and why he voted certain ways, and I received either a cookie cutter response from most likely an aide or no response at all.  He also was our federal MP and did nothing, and then quit. I concede that he had a good reason (his son) but I still think he was fairly useless. I 100% believe that he just likes being in the public eye and that's the reason he won."
alberta,350ado,starshadowx2,2,Wed May 6 03:24:13 2015 UTC,Mike Allen had been separated from his wife at the time. So far it looks like Wildrose has won both Fort Mac ridings.
alberta,350ado,MechaCanadaII,20,Wed May 6 03:17:03 2015 UTC,8:25: Orange spikes ahead in % votes  8:37: [PC DUNKING INTENSIFIES]
alberta,350ado,wolfeward,7,Wed May 6 03:21:12 2015 UTC,It just took off!
alberta,350ado,Oplexus,4,Wed May 6 02:26:08 2015 UTC,Looking that way. Wildrose has more seats than the PCs right now.
alberta,350ado,swiftb3,9,Wed May 6 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what people think of the WR, it makes me so happy they are beating the PCs. Just twists the knife. Heheh."

alberta,350ado,thencaapawardgoesto,1 point,Wed May 6 02:44:33 2015 UTC,They need to do a lot of things. They completely and entirely botched this election. When was the last time they secured less than 5% of the votes province-wide?
alberta,350ado,CJsAviOr,1 point,Wed May 6 03:05:13 2015 UTC,I think we can say that it was last election that they botched. This election they were completely irrelevant.
alberta,350ado,swiftb3,1 point,Wed May 6 03:11:20 2015 UTC,Last election was par for the course for LPA. At the very least they had a candidate in each riding (87). This year they seemingly didn't have anyone willing to run.
alberta,350ado,Kaelteth,2,Wed May 6 02:02:48 2015 UTC,Blakeman will retain her seat.  Edit: Or not.

alberta,350ado,Aprime1,2,Wed May 6 02:36:08 2015 UTC,Anybody keeping an eye on the lesser slave lake riding? That thing's been jumping WR to NDP non-stop.
alberta,350ado,L7weeeny,2,Wed May 6 02:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's incredibly close. It'll probably require a full count of ballots before the winner is announced. With 45/65 polls counted, Wildrose only leads by 22 votes. No way to call it in that riding."
alberta,350ado,zhantongz,2,Wed May 6 02:36:25 2015 UTC,"I expected a toss between WR and PC in that riding. This whole election has been way out of left field.   I agree, that one will need a full count. Looks like a long night for the vote counters could be ahead!"
alberta,350ado,nomofica,2,Wed May 6 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"I also expected a WR/PC battle with NDP following close behind. Recent update showed a large swing back into the NDP court with a 40-vote lead, and then back to WR with a 3-vote lead. I don't think I've ever been so excited to see the results in a riding and I don't even live there."
alberta,350ado,zhantongz,1 point,Wed May 6 02:39:01 2015 UTC,That's such an odd riding. Basically the entirety of rural Calgary bar the immediate south. Definitely looks like it'll stay conservative.

alberta,350ado,L7weeeny,2,Wed May 6 03:48:08 2015 UTC,I don't think it'll ever happen. They have a total of 23 total votes in their favour thus far.
alberta,350ado,CarlSpackler22,3,Wed May 6 03:51:04 2015 UTC,Worst case scenario - your dad will have to lay a few people off because of a deterioration in business confidence that occurs whenever a more leftist party forms government. I doubt it will go under because of NDP policies though. Chill out! I'm a conservative and this is awesome to watch! Genuine democracy at play. :)
alberta,350ado,L7weeeny,4,Wed May 6 03:54:09 2015 UTC,If the business makes under a half million in profit....zero effect.  If it makes more than a half million - an additional 2% of profit will go to the taxman.

I don't think I will be voting PC again.   I am not trolling but I would love to hear move of the ""cultural pride"" that you mentioned, please explain."
alberta,351p7e,bubblesqueak,14,Wed May 6 13:23:30 2015 UTC,I'm not OP but as someone who was born in the 80s and grew up under King Ralph and the PCs when I first started voting I voted PC because that was just what everyone did. Kind of like how all the cool kids smoked. As I've grown up and now have a family I've realized that the PCs have gutted Alberta (not to say any other party wouldn't have). Looking back in hindsight I remember my class sizes going from 20 to 24 kids per class jumping to 30 to 35 kids some years. I now realize that just voting to vote isn't  right.
alberta,351p7e,Blt2002,9,Wed May 6 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"No worries.  (This is actually kind of hard. I never expected to run into someone that wasn't aware that this sort of subculture existed, especially with the hyper-conservative redditors showing up in these threads recently. HA! It's really hard to explain the culture of redneck Alberta.)  The easiest way that I can explain it for someone that doesn't understand is to look up ""Meanwhile in Alberta"" and apply the same misguided ideals and that the page supports to a larger group of people.    I grew up in a VERY rural area. The area I grew up in still attracts a large percent of the youth to stay, as opposed to leaving for the cities and getting an education, hell, 20% of the kids I was supposed to grad with (not long ago, mind you) dropped out. The powerful families in the area are generally very successful in the agricultural sector and it wasn't uncommon just a few years ago to see these families pulling their 11, 12 year old kids from school to help combine or seed. Like I've already said, there is an intense conservative background here. These families are blue collar workers who carry either the beliefs or what are the remnants of traditional Christian beliefs that have been deeply engrained into their family and those around them. Liken these people to Republicans south of the Mason-Dixon, because their ideologies are similar. The culture is different, but the ideologies are very similar. With young people in the area, the oil boom has definitely created a false sense of security and it hasn't helped with the problem of the lack of education, or the problem of the lack of importance imposed on education. They saw the oil patch as a way to bypass education on the way to monetary success, and as we know, education serves a larger purpose than just readying people for jobs. A large group of these young people, as well as  the past generations of their families missed the opportunity to expose themselves to different viewpoints. If you're still with me, we have a subculture of Albertans that have been raised without the push for education, the basic westernized bare-bones Christian ideologies, and kind of, this weird lack of awareness of the world around them that they never really had the chance to grow. We've been the target group of campaigns like the PC's fear-mongering campaign against the NDP in this recent election, and we've bought it. There is this ""drink beer-drive a big truck- hunt animals-go muddin' an' let 'er rip- WOOO Oil Country"" kind of point of view happening, and I'm not saying that it's wrong. I love the area I grew up in, but I also find it fascinating. Some areas of rural Alberta definitely have this strange, almost redneck cultural pride going on. It's not prevalent in the larger rural areas from what I've seen, but it definitely is still there. I really hope that I've helped you understand, and I hope that I haven't offended anyone, because it's how I was raised and I don't feel like I was making fun of the other very rural Albertans in this post.   EDIT: Missed a word. #2: Period."

alberta,351p7e,Commisar,4,Wed May 6 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"No, but the culture itself has this underlying Christian background, and that absolutely plays a part in the desire to vote conservative. The other day I replied to a post from a very conservative WRP supporter who claimed that the WRP were the Christian moral choice. I'm sure you've encountered these people!haha Religion is still very important in many rural areas, but the lasting effects of the ideologies passed down from religious parents are a huge contributor to the youth voting conservative.  Edit: Let me find that comment for you. I'd also like to add that perhaps you haven't spent any meaningful time in super rural areas, and that's fine, but to give you an idea of how rural an area I lived in, I went to two high schools. They were about 50 mins away from each other, and one had about 80 kids in a grade, and the other had less than 15. I didn't spend much time in the tiny school, but I lived much closer to it. Many of the schools in the area have 20 or less kids in a grade.  Edit: I found it! In fact, I think that this user is a great example of everything I was talking about in my explanatory post."

alberta,351p7e,aardvarkious,5,Wed May 6 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Although at first glance this seems like an ideological seismic shift in Alberta, it really doesn't quite hold up. The PC party held power for as long as they did by being surprisingly centrist in their policies, and the NDP that was voted in last night was (on paper so far) only a little left of centre. It wasn't the huge leap that it may appear to be.  Secondly, most Albertans still voted for a conservative party, but the vote was split. So most Albertan's still aren't interested in a left of centre party, and federally the Conservatives have no competition.   While I'd love to see federal parties actually court Alberta, and not treat us as a forgone conclusion, I'm not sure this adds up to the revolution it looks. If the NDP prove themselves competent and don't veer too far left in their policies here they could help the federal brand, but I think the federal branch would have to make some moves towards the centre to really court Alberta voters.  edited a word"
alberta,351p7e,drock45,3,Wed May 6 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible now, especially in Edmonton. I'm just not sure they'll arrive at the conclusion that it's worth it. I think the majority of ridings in Alberta are certain to go Conservative still, and they may piss off old fans by moving to the centre. I think Quebec is still going to be a more important battleground for both sides, and it'll absorb most of their attention.   That being said, even having politicians just show up once in awhile would be a big step up attention-wise."

alberta,351p7e,drock45,3,Wed May 6 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"For the first time voting, I truly have no idea who I'll vote for federally.  I did vote PC last time around, because I thought they could still do some good, but they've gone far too heavy-handed with their majority and do whatever they want and it really bugs me that it's so clear people don't want C-51, but Harper's trying to ram it through anyway.  That and I'm a US expatriate, so I'm pretty peeved that I have to report all my accounts to the US because Harper caved and let them have what they wanted.  Trudeau comes with a name, but other than that, he seems... slick.  I'm not sure how to describe the feeling.  The federal NDP, from my view, are farther left than the local NDP, (the local being centrist by necessity), and I'm not too keen on a left-wing government.  The Bloc... LOL.  So, yeah.  I have no idea."
alberta,351p7e,swiftb3,3,Wed May 6 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"I'm still going with Harper, this was more about showing that bad representation should get punished and that the party deserves to be held accountable, even with a new leader running. I agree with another poster that I am upset about where C-51 is heading and have wrote my MLA addressing these concerns, but at the end of the day, the fiscally conservative side of me says that Harper has done a pretty decent job with the economy in a down cycle."
alberta,351p7e,lzetsen,1 point,Wed May 6 17:40:14 2015 UTC,"I think I'd put myself in this category as well.  I'm with them for financial, I hate 'em for their backwards approach to lawmaking.  It'll boil down to which of those two I care more about on the next election day."
alberta,351p7e,rockfire,2,Wed May 6 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"Not really.    I don't have any particular allegiance to a political party, but I typically feel like the Conservatives are closest to what I want ideologically.  Every election I research the candidates and the party platforms and make a fresh decision on who I am voting for.   I haven't voted conservative in Alberta for a long time.  That decision has less to do with my support of other parties than it does with my lack of support for the provincial conservatives.  My decision for where to place my vote in the upcoming Federal election will not be influenced by the NDP win, but neither is it guaranteed to be any particular party."
alberta,351p7e,theophilus153,2,Wed May 6 13:20:56 2015 UTC,done with harper. that is all.
alberta,351p7e,3MIN3MS,1 point,Wed May 6 17:26:12 2015 UTC,I have supported NDP ideas and principles since I could vote.  This election gives me hope we might see a few more NDP ferderally from Alberta.
alberta,351p7e,Dabookitty,1 point,Wed May 6 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. I don't yet know for certain who I'm going to vote for in the next federal election, but it almost certainly won't be Harper. If Harper decides not to run for some reason, might reconsider... but probably not."
alberta,351p7e,mylastbreath,0,Wed May 6 18:19:47 2015 UTC,For me personally I don't trust Trudeau at all. NDP has fallen to the abyss since Jack Layton passed. So yeah I am unfortunately going team blue again.   I just want it to be a minority PC in charge with a good opposition.
alberta,351p7e,ExtremeFlourStacking,7,Wed May 6 16:57:10 2015 UTC,How has NDP fallen into the abyss?
alberta,351p7e,bubblesqueak,-2,Thu May 7 00:20:00 2015 UTC,They will never be as strong as they were since Layton passed away. To get to where they were the official opposition again will be a long time coming I think.  Edit: Can no one have an opinion without getting down voted...
alberta,351p7e,ExtremeFlourStacking,8,Wed May 6 13:14:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The popularity in NDP federally is far stronger right now, than it was with Layton at the same time last election."
alberta,351p7e,CiRcA84,5,Wed May 6 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"This is the same for me. I was excited when I saw that Marc Garneau was positioned to be the Liberal leader and was ready to vote Lib federally because I'm a centrist and their platform is what I want.  But Trudeau seems to sometimes actively campaign against his party's platform. So I'm voting for Harper again most likely.  The Federal NDP party is a lot further left than the AB one. Particularly worrying are their strong desires to eliminate the Senate but not party whips (consolidating all power in the PMO by ensuring loyalty in the event of a majority) and to implement Proportional Representation  (in Canada where everyone votes regionally and 1/3 of the population lives in two provinces), without getting rid of whips."

alberta,35490c,trendless,3,Thu May 7 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I came across as a bit terse before.  Dealing with fearmongers all day both online and in the real world.  Alberta obviously has a private auto insurance system, but prices are regulated to a high degree especially for mandatory coverages.  The Alberta regulatory body gets independant actuarial studies done each year to indicate what a fair rate increase should be , and then gov't board sets a cap on a rate increase based on that . ( I'll also add the the rate increase has for a number of years been less than what the actuary indicated it should be based on the past experience.)  After that - companies have to file their rate changes within that cap using their own data which can be accepted or rejected by the board.  It's a system that's been in place for a number of years now and seems to work okay.  It might hold in check drastic price swings but on the other hand it does tend to stiffle some price competition.  As for any government publicizing auto insurance, whether it be NDP or otherwise, the system would have to be drastically broken and beyond repair in order for that to happen."
alberta,35490c,trendless,1 point,Thu May 7 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly fine with the election results. It's just that as a BC refugee, I don't want to see this province spiral down the same path that BC did on these issues."
alberta,35490c,cchrisgc,5,Thu May 7 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine this is something they'd even think of changing, let alone change.  There are enough Albertans who know what a clusterfuck ICBC is to know that would be a terrible idea.  Frankly, the new government has bigger fish to fry."
alberta,35490c,cchrisgc,1 point,Thu May 7 04:51:36 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I hoped to hear.  It's nice to see that this political upheaval isn't accompanied by the same blind fanaticism that accompanies the left in British Columbia.  I could learn to love the NDP... especially if its supporters continue to be reasonable minded people with a grip on reality who are willing to put their foot down if something so backwards  and evil like ICBC were to ever raise its head in this province.
alberta,35490c,cchrisgc,2,Thu May 7 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"As a BCer, I wouldn't wish ICBC on anyone."

alberta,3533fz,Windig0,7,Wed May 6 18:34:08 2015 UTC,A quick look at the Fiscal Reference Tables shows that NDP governments have tabled the most balanced budgets of any party by quite a margin.

alberta,3533fz,bawbzilla,5,Wed May 6 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"Fear and misunderstandings are a huge amount of it. People who really understand what the deal is aren't terribly prone to shouting that the sky is falling, just that things might be different and not be optimal for them. This goes in any direction; the NDP winning or the PCs winning isn't going to mean Alberta will literally be wiped off the map as some people on /r/alberta or /r/Canada would have you believe."
alberta,3533fz,cchrisgc,-9,Wed May 6 18:30:00 2015 UTC,Balancing a budget with outrageous taxation and wild spending? This isn't favorable to many people. The lagging economies that follow the ndp means more tax load on the people.
alberta,3533fz,Squashparty,6,Wed May 6 18:42:18 2015 UTC,Except the economies that the NDP left behind weren't lagging.  You can look up actual historic economic statistics...

Not sure if they have to wait until the PCs get their ducks in a row and find a new candidate. It shouldn't be too hard since there's lots of former MLAs  without seats this morning.   Or they could take the cue that fresh faces are needed to salvage the situation.   A lot depends on how much feelings in the riding are hurt over Prentice taking his ball and going home last night instead of staying on to represent them like he agreed to when he put his name in.

Fair enough, that's pretty childish (IMO) to drop out with your tail between your legs minutes after your party lost the election.  I think it would take some serious convincing and distancing to change the peoples views on it. Look how easily Alberta said no to the PCs, after being disrespected by Prentice I can't imagine the riding would want PC to still represent them.

Our alternative choice was WR; although conservative this party has also lost the trust of Albertans.   We took the least worst option, and forced change.   Either NDP will fuck it up and overspend, but most of us are hoping they correct the PCs cuts but maintain moderate budgeting."
alberta,351zj2,TnkrbllThmbsckr,7,Wed May 6 13:40:10 2015 UTC,"I would say, this election was not as much ""yes NDP"" as it was ""Aw, hell no PC"".  We haven't really wanted to vote PC for over a decade, but we haven't had a viable alternative until this election.  (Personally, I'm mostly a conservative voter ideologically, but I haven't voted conservative provincially for a long time).  This time, we had a party that had a candidate in every riding that put forward a moderate platform and could hold their own in the campaigns and debates.  In other words, we finally had another option, and we took it.    The PC's have simply been in power for too long.  Even if the NDP does a terrible job, I think the end result will be good for our province because it will still force the conservative parties to reboot.  I voted NDP.  I'm happy they won.  I'm a bit nervous, but very optimistic for our province."
alberta,351zj2,theophilus153,2,Wed May 6 13:41:27 2015 UTC,"It feels like they lost on purpose almost.   (Tinfoil hat on) Consider this: Shadowy corporate overlords that really control everything look at current state of PCs and world oil economy, decide that it is time to let the NDP take the rap for the the next 4 years of hard times. Then Albertans will vote in the WR, who will have been very carefully eradicating their rep as the ""lake of fire"" party while providing sober, principled opposition. The financial misery of the NDP administration will discredit them and they will return to obscurity, and another 40 year dynasty of industry-friendly government will commence.   (Tinfoil hat off) The entertainment now will be watching Notley trying to please everybody. As financial reality forces the NDP to adjust their plans, they will anger their base, and the increase in taxes and implementation of the NDP social platform will anger the right. She's gonna be real busy."

They came out of the leading conservative party which was moving to the left. They are fiscally conservative and socially conservative as well, although not to the degree that their opponents claim. They will likely become the only right wing party in Alberta and at some point become the ruling party, just as federally the CPC took over from the old conservative party in Canada."

alberta,354coy,unjung,1 point,Thu May 7 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"In addition, the PCs suffered two weak leaders who were no one's first choice - Stelmach and Redford.

He squandered that opportunity.   Very different than Campbell."

You need to look at the differences in the job prospects, potential salary, cost of living, etc in the places that you're considering living. If it looks like either will work financially then you need to think about the lifestyle you're looking for.

That is not to say I supported the PC party in any way.   I see this resignation from the MLA seat as disgusting and he should be shamed, though it is likely he will go back corporate or federal.   Edit: The sad part about this to me is that the PC have self-destructed and will now either go into private sector positions equally with the Wildrose. The PC's will in effect swap into the WR party. I may be wrong but I think a wild swing like this in Alberta will ultimately result in a WR majority in the next election and will just be the PC's all over again.

alberta,34xyor,44years,-3,Tue May 5 18:08:52 2015 UTC,So you are saying 1 in 20 would rather sit on welfare than take a job that is available and pays better than welfare but requires more work than welfare? While we have millions of people lining up willing to take that job but they are not allowed into the country.
alberta,34xyor,Ashlir,5,Tue May 5 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"no, im saying that we have an unemployment rate of 5.4% right now.    in a province that has 5.4% unemployement, that means 5.4% of the population isnt working. (sorry to be redundant here but i want to be painfully clear)  So lets say we have a PC government that brings in TFW's. How is the government helping the people it governs by importing labour when the labour is already in the province waiting to be utilized?  Its helping corporations though - by providing labour that works cheaper than a livable wage. for example, the Jensens who owned 4 tim hortons in edmonton/st.albert back in 2003 (i think they have 6 now?) bought a house to put 15 philipinos in while all of them worked at the tim hortons locations for less than legal wage (since rent was free and included in their pay).  This was a while back, but it still happens.  K-days was busted ~8 years ago for putting africans into the trailers to sleep on hey in the day time while they cleaned up the grounds at night.  Its feudalism writ large - TFW's simply dont have the same rights as an Albertan when it comes to labour laws, and there isnt much in the way of regulation to prevent it.  now - if TFW's had the same rights as albertans did when working in alberta I wouldnt have a problem at all with it. CEO's would have to pay the same amount either way - in other words play fair."
alberta,34xyor,44years,8,Tue May 5 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"If you want to be clear, you should probably know that 5.4% unemployment doesn't mean that 5.4% of the population isn't working. It means that 5.4% of people in the labour force aren't working.   Labour force includes: people currently working part or full time, or people who are willing and able to work, and are actively seeking work.  Labour force does not include: anyone who chooses not to work, anyone who would like to work but is not actively looking for work, anyone who cannot work, everyone below the age of 15.  So, technically, 5.4% unemployment means that 5.4% of the ~70% of the population of people who are 15 and over who are in the labour force are not working. If you count from age 0, I'm thinking that probably 40-45% of the population doesn't work."

alberta,34xyor,MorgothEatsUrBabies,-4,Wed May 6 00:29:53 2015 UTC,When did people voluntarily moving here become slavery? Victim complex much? Preventing people who want a better life from coming here is preventing people from coming to work.
alberta,34xyor,Ashlir,3,Tue May 5 20:01:01 2015 UTC,"Well technically no one prevents them from anything - if they want to become Canadians they should apply for citizenship. Maybe we should do away with that process and automatically grant citizenship to anyone who asks, I don't know.  But the TFW program is not that. It's our government spending money to artificially lower salaries here. I'm all for people coming from abroad to work here if they feel it's good for them, but I can't accept that my tax dollars are being used to sponsor that."

Last I checked this is still a democracy so I still get a voice in how my tax dollars are spent.  Beyond that though, you still haven't confirmed that you're against the TFW program. Given your pretty radical view on world labor, I don't see any way that you can be in support of that program but I'd love to hear your rationale."
alberta,34xyor,MorgothEatsUrBabies,-3,Tue May 5 21:03:00 2015 UTC,You don't have any choice in how your tax dollars are spent that is a flat out lie. If I had a say it wouldn't be spent on wars.

alberta,34xyor,44years,9,Tue May 5 20:40:56 2015 UTC,I managed and worked at a fast food joint for a year and it was so hard to find anyone locally ages 16 to 18 that were loyal enough to show up or even respect the job. Sadly we had alot of our TFW's were probably some of the best and hardest workers I've seen. I'm for Albertans working but there has to be a change of entitlement for our youth also. Most feel that why should I work attitude which really makes it hard to fill local positions. I think we need a system where we still can use TFW's but have a more controlled ratio between them and local workers.
alberta,34xyor,Agent47pureaidsrun,21,Tue May 5 20:43:31 2015 UTC,Entitlement? It's not entitlement if they don't find the wages to be worth the work.   Entitlement is expecting people to accept whatever is offered.
alberta,34xyor,g_gundy,1 point,Tue May 5 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what it is. Kid's with no employable skills doing unskilled labor aren't worth more than min wage. Once they've gotten some schooling/training/experience then sure, but until then you take what you get.  Taking a job while you're in high school should teach you 2 things:    The value of a dollar and how you actually need to WORK for it.  The value of education/training/experience. Min wage isn't enough to get by as an adult, but if you're a high school kid, it's enough for a little discretionary spending and learning  how the world works."
alberta,34xyor,Cthulu2013,14,Tue May 5 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"In an economy like Alberta's during a boom... Not. A. Single. Person should be making minimum wage.   If the economy is so strong then why are people still at the bottom? If some small town farm boy can go make 60k a year as a welders assistant for example, why would he waste his time at McDonald's for 12/h? Then you hear all these franchises reaping the rewards of a booming economy and then refusing to pay back into their labour force.   Go to any oil town in AB, the drivethroughs are lined up around the block before/after shift change and theyre under staffed with TFW making 13/h. It's a joke. Plain and simple."
alberta,34xyor,g_gundy,2,Tue May 5 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"In your example, there's a lot more to being a welder's assistant than working in fast food- both in terms of skills and difficulty, but I agree with your comment as a whole. If there's better available, obviously you should take it! And if you can't hire anyone for that wage, it should go higher.  And for the record, I do think the program is abused in many instances like this and should be used solely for difficult-to-fill SKILLED positions. That being said, I've seen my share of youth entitlement which is what my comment was addressing. The same group that turns their nose and jobs ""beneath them"" then goes to complain about not having the no job skills or experience for what they want to do."
alberta,34xyor,Cthulu2013,9,Tue May 5 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"It's considered beneath because it's neither fulfilling nor well paying, I worked as a landscape labourer for 12/h(3 yrs ago), worked/froze my ass off but I had something to show for myself and was learning a skill. Same pay, higher fulfilment.   If McDonald's paid a hefty wage in return for commitment and efficiency then it would instantly turn into ""the place to be"", it's free market, they pay minimum wage, they get absolute bottom of the barrel prospects. TFW cheats the free market by undercutting higher quality prospects who would demand higher pay by bringing in desperate foreigners. Don't argue that it wouldn't be sustainable, increase cost of goods. Groceries are so expensive in Alberta that fast food is actually the highest value nutrition available, that seems beyond well marketed to me."
alberta,34xyor,g_gundy,1 point,Tue May 5 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's only beneath you if you're willing to put in the extra effort to do something better. Using yourself as an example: you were willing to work a much more physically draining and labor intensive job because you wanted a higher wage/more fulfillment. A lot of people are NOT willing to do that and those are the people I'm talking about here.  As for the TFW, I'm going to copy my reply to another comment: I diagree with it's use in filling UNSKILLED positions and believe should be used only for hiring to for difficult-to-fill SKILLED positions. The market should take care of the rest. What I disagree about is the assertion that bottom-of-the-barrel positions are inherently “worth more” than minimum wage. Let the market decide if it is or isn’t."
alberta,34xyor,Agent47pureaidsrun,14,Tue May 5 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"No, that's not what it is at all.  And I'm not sure why you keep babbling about high school. Fast foods are not charities that provide jobs for kids. They are businesses that generate revenue and require personnel to do so. Apparently at your outlet, potential employees did not consider your compensation to be adequate, so they did not participate. It doesn't matter if they are 17 or 77. End of story. Your rhetoric does not change reality.   THAT is how the world works."
alberta,34xyor,toddgak,-2,Tue May 5 21:39:04 2015 UTC,Maybe in some statist wet dream fast food places pay $20/h and only hire locals which somehow will be lining up to flip burgers.   Personally I hate almost all fast food so I won't be sad to see them go. The TFW can go back to to where they came from and maybe the people of Alberta can cook their own damn food.
alberta,34xyor,Cdncameron,-7,Tue May 5 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"""And I'm not sure why you keep babbling about high school."" - People keep mentioning high school  because the OP of the comment specified 16-18 year olds.... High schoolers  ""Fast foods are not charities that provide jobs for kids. They are businesses that generate revenue and require personnel to do so."" - You are 100% correct, and in order to remain competitive they pay a minimal wage in order to make a decent gross margin on a $2 hamburger.  ""Apparently at your outlet, potential employees did not consider your compensation to be adequate, so they did not participate."" - And in the cases of adults with experience/skills to bring to the table it's their prerogative to not accept the job. The company I'm with had a hard time filing our finance/accounting positions before the burst because we held the stability of the position to be a factor when setting the salary, so no one wanted to come to us for 10K or more less a year than they were getting on Oil and Gas... but when setting what you are willing to pay you take those things into account, in the case of fast food (again the topic because it's what OP was referring to) you take into account the lack of previous experience (which is admittedly an assumption as someone could be coming from an A&W to a burger king)   ""It doesn't matter if they are 17 or 77"" - actually it does, a 77 year old probably has way more skills and experience than a 17 year old.  ""End of story. Your rhetoric does not change reality."" - Neither does yours, end of story"

Once they've gotten some schooling/training/experience then sure, but until then you take what you get.   I can see how you wouldn't like it but that's simply not true. If it were, there would be no need for TFWs. Unfortunately (or fortunately!), kids have expectations now and if companies aren't willing to meet those expectations well, they won't be able to staff their businesses, simple as that.  We hired a kid from high school where I work, last summer. 16 years old, pretty bright, zero work experience before. We paid him ~1.7x min wage - slightly under what someone with experience would make but not an exploitative salary. Guess what? He didn't miss a day, he worked hard and learned a ton, loved his time here, wants to come back this summer.   It's almost like you have to pay people decent salaries if you want them to be reliable and hard working..."
alberta,34xyor,g_gundy,1 point,Wed May 6 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're misunderstanding my post.    Kid's with no employable skills doing unskilled labor aren't worth more than min wage.   The student you hired (he sounds great by the way!) was, as you mentioned: bright, punctual and hard-working. Those are employable skills. The kid you hired isn’t who I’m referencing. You wouldn't have paid him what you did or kept him employed if he was lazy, unreliable and didn’t take the job seriously. But there’s a LOT of kids that age that are (and I’m sure many of us were as well). THAT is who I’m talking about. That’s who I’m referencing when I’m talking about kids needing to learn the value of a dollar and the value of education/experience.   As I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I agree that the TFW program is being abused and that it should be used only for hiring to for difficult-to-fill SKILLED positions.  The market should take care of the rest. What I disagree about is the assertion that bottom-of-the-barrel positions are inherently “worth more” than minimum wage. Let the market decide if it is or isn’t.  EDIT: Spelling"
alberta,34xyor,Cdncameron,0,Wed May 6 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"A youth (which is what solodayz quantified) with no experience expecting more than minimum wage for a job that requires a few days (if that) in training... Yes that's entitlement... And that's coming from a person who worked in fast food through highschool and the job started at student wage (less than min) you start there you get raises and you spend your riches on overpriced 128mb mp3 players.   If you're talking about adults, even than I'm mixed on it just because I know how little training/experience is required for something like fast food. Should min wage pay for a min standard of living, yes, but it should be your starting point not someones full time 30 year gig... even if you go from a McNastys to working in an actual kitchen you'll be moving up and making better money."
alberta,34xyor,Trucidar,3,Tue May 5 20:07:54 2015 UTC,You're confusing options with entitlement. Why would they leave unless they found something better?
alberta,34xyor,Cdncameron,1 point,Tue May 5 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"I thought I was giving an example of leaving to find something better, in going from fast food to an actual restaurant. The only thing fast food and the like are good for are to give people (generally young people) working experience so that they can go on to something better, so they can go from an A&W to working at a pub/restaurant kitchen, so they can go from Walmart to something not a walmart.   In terms of the confusing options with entitlement, imo a young person going for their first job turning up their nose at a job because they think they're time is worth more without showing that it is worth more sounds like a sense of entitlement to me. In terms of adults it's a different story, mainly because a min wage doesn't get a min standard of living when it should, and people living pay cheque to pay cheque would have a harder time trying to shop around for work because of the uncertainty it produces.  Odds are given that it's online communication though we're all missing most of what the other people in the thread are trying to get across. I think min wage has its merits, if we want to be able to get a coffee/hamburger for so cheep it should worry people as to what's in it, there's going to be companies who's business model it is to higher unskilled, generally young workers for min wage... and ideally they get something on their resume and go somewhere better."
alberta,34xyor,Dabookitty,-7,Tue May 5 16:20:46 2015 UTC,"It's entitlement.    Young unskilled workers aren't worth as much as they think they are.    If they can justify a higher wage with certain skills, abilities or training that others are lacking then sure they deserve more and can ask for more.  but a Kid off the street asking for more then Minimum wage with no skills...that is entitlement."
alberta,34xyor,Dabookitty,-5,Wed May 6 02:16:46 2015 UTC,"If you can't find enough to fill the jobs, clearly they are worth more than what you're paying them   That is the entitlement in a nut shell.  They think they are worth more...but they have nothing making them worth the amount they are asking.  Hire wages are earned.  We are still talking about unskilled teens and young adults here...   Maybe if you paid them what they were worth (and didn't have such a sense of entitlement to cheap labour) you'd have better luck retaining good employees.   Entitlement to cheap labour?!?  IF I am to hire a unskilled teenager and train them up to be able to work for me, they will get raises when they deserve it.  If they are not willing work up to a better wage...to bad so sad.  They have no skills worth a higher wage.  I've hired teens before over the years...only one was willing to put in the time and effort to learn and be trained.  He is making a good money now since he earned it.  If they are going to flake out for whatever reason they are not worth a higher wage.    I reserve this to entry level unskilled or low skill jobs.  The one that anyone could realistically fill."

It's not a ton, but it's not like the companies are paying minimum wage so the workers should just screw around and quit whenever. People work hard in other areas for wages that bring a lot less buying power.  That said.. It is the free market system at work. Abundance of jobs means jobs have to try harder to retain workers. When I was working retail, Costco was probably the best place I worked. Although they paid the same I was used to, they also did little things like asked for worker input, attempted to try to invest workers in the store (through involvement and promotion) and the free food. Lest we forget the free snacks in the lunchroom. Those were incentives that made me want to work there in an economy where I had a pretty large selection of jobs."

Anybody throwing  out that line ""I can't find anybody"" without  the following qualification should have and an angel pop on there shoulders and repeat that line into their ear for eternity.   ""at the rate I want to pay.""  We are told their is a labour market.  Well if we workers are just a piece of meat to be bought.

alberta,34xyor,Ashlir,-9,Tue May 5 23:14:24 2015 UTC,When workers prevent other workers from entering the market that's protectionism. There are billions of people who want that job at that rate but are not allowed access to that job which artificially raises the cost of labor and the cost of everything else labor spends that money on. We have a system designed to keep people chasing their tails. And to prevent the people who are the worst off from competing.
alberta,34xyor,MorgothEatsUrBabies,4,Wed May 6 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"So you're saying, any human should be allowed to work any job, anywhere, anytime, with no silly restrictions like nationality? Is that your position?"

You should have the choice of withholding taxes if they aren't being spent in a way that pleases you. If you don't like war you shouldn't be forced to support it. If you don't like poor foreigners having jobs then you should be allowed to not support it with your money. It's kind of right wing to not want to give equal opportunity to people.

alberta,34xyor,MorgothEatsUrBabies,1 point,Tue May 5 20:14:35 2015 UTC,"Well I kind of agree but leaving it up to people to withhold or pay taxes is a recipe for disaster. Individuals can't be relied on to make the right decision for things that don't immediately affect them, and even then it's dicey. Who will pay for roads? Who will pay for national parks upkeep? Who will pay for environmental protection? Who will pay for scientific research? There's a ton of excellent things the government does that don't immediately and directly benefit individuals - if you give individuals the ability to remove funding from those I guarantee they would go mostly unfunded. IMO that's not how the human race moves forward.  Also, you have to track people some way. It has nothing to do with treating them like cattle, it's just basic logistics. If you don't track them, how can they have worker protection? Should there even be worker rights? What about things like Workers Compensation Board? How will it be funded? If no workers are tracked, how can an injured worker present a claim and be paid? What happens in cases of employer abuse?   If you don't track people, how can you prevent fraud? Would people even have criminal records? How would an employer find out if he's about to hire a murderer? Does the employer even have that right?  I get what you're saying and ideologically I kinda agree but you're basically handwaving away so much, it doesn't make a ton of sense."

alberta,34xyor,Dataeater,-8,Wed May 6 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"If we run out of unskilled labor, we'll have to raise wages high enough to attract Canadians that are working in relatively skilled jobs. Higher wages for fast food workers will incentivize all workers to move down the skills ladder. Low level sales, construction, nursing, or oilfield workers might be the most likely candidates to move to fast food. Then, even higher level workers might try to move down to fill in for those lost to the fast food industry. Eventually as labor is re-allocated downwards we'd get to the point where there would be less of higher level services available throughout the economy. Would you support increased immigration or increased TFW's if it ever got to that point?"
alberta,34xyor,Sidewinder77,9,Wed May 6 18:48:33 2015 UTC,It works the other way.  Less labour supply put pressure on employers to increase wage and working conditions.
alberta,34xyor,Solipsize,-5,Tue May 5 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"Think of it in terms of a communist economy. If we have to allocate to fast food higher skilled workers that could be producing higher value stuff, there's less higher value stuff produced and less to go around."
alberta,34xyor,Sidewinder77,5,Tue May 5 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"Wage increases due to decreased labour supply apply to all jobs, they don't just happen in a vacuum in one sector. Skilled workers get a bump too because their employers know they have to raise wages in order to keep their employees from moving down the chain, as you've suggested. Labour supply decreases are usually a good thing for all workers; there's the same amount of wage money spread out over less people = higher wages for everyone.   That's just how economics works my man."
alberta,34xyor,Solipsize,-2,Tue May 5 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"If we lived in a world where everyone was already at Canada's skill level, wages would rise as you describe along with the prices that Canadian consumers pay. However, since we live in a world with lots of still unskilled and low paid labor, we have an opportunity to use that labor to make our economy and our standard of livings better, while simultaneously raising the living standards of the currently low skilled who will instantly have an opportunity to produce significantly more value than then could if they did not come to Canada.   The more low skilled people we let come to Canada, the more Canadians will be freed up from performing low skilled task and enabled to move into higher skilled and higher paying jobs. There will be a transitional phase of changing jobs and re-training, but the end result is more prosperity for everyone."
alberta,34xyor,Sidewinder77,5,Tue May 5 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Your argument works if we see more low skilled permanent residents come to Alberta. I'm all for free movement. But that clearly isn't happening - we have a labour shortage. Why? Because the wages that businesses are offering to low skilled employees are not attractive enough for people to come and raise a family here.  As a substitute for genuine market equilibrium, we are flying in TFWs. This balances the labour market, but does little or nothing for the goods market because these new workers aren't reinvesting their earned income in our economy, they're investing it in theirs. The result is that economic growth stagnates. Business is playing the short game to avoid wage increases, but do not realize they are shooting themselves in the foot in the long run. The consumer gets low prices in the meantime, but also isn't making as much as they should be.   Every job needs to contribute demand to our economy for other workers up the skills chain to see the benefits - even the low skilled ones."
alberta,34xyor,Solipsize,-1,Tue May 5 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"What do you think TFW's do when they transfer Canadian dollars to their home economy? Eat em?  Answer: They exchange them for local currency which results in either the exchanger purchasing Canadian goods/services with them, or, the Canadian dollar drops in value making our exports more attractive. In the end Canadians can afford more of the goods/services that TFW's create while they're here, and Canadian exporters prosper creating more export related jobs. Canadians standards of living rise, and the TFW's lives are often miraculously transformed. It really is a win-win deal. :)  Letting TFW's or any low skilled workers come here is an opportunity for Canadians. Future generations will not have that same opportunity once all places have become developed. We should seize the day."
alberta,34xyor,Sidewinder77,3,Tue May 5 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"You're not fundamentally wrong, but it's not an excuse for crowding out permanent jobs and artificially holding wages low.   Will the export sector see some minor benefit from a falling CAD due to a few currency exchanges from each TFW? (remember, they're temporary) - yes. Our imports and balance of payments will suffer from the same effect, but lets leave that aside.   Compare those benefits to the economic benefit of having new permanent residents who will continue to spend money, pay taxes and supply labour for likely the rest of their lives, as well as have children here who will do the same after them. Such a benefit won't help just our export sector, it will help ALL sectors: housing, energy, agriculture, media, you name it.   Again, I welcome foreigners. I want to create an environment for them to prosper with a secure job and participation in the country that they work in. I know we can create this environment because we have a labour shortage, yet have vastly undeveloped economic potential. I'm only opposed to the 'temporary' in TFW."
alberta,34xyor,mobile_shit,0,Tue May 5 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, I'm not sure there's any difference in the big picture if the worker is temporary or permanent, but I'd agree with you that it would be better if all workers were permanent and there should be no such thing as the TFW program. Unfortunately it's not politically profitable to increase immigration numbers."
alberta,34xyor,Sidewinder77,5,Tue May 5 21:29:49 2015 UTC,Nursing would bleed workers to fast food? Do you even think about what you're writing?
alberta,34xyor,cjsedwards,-8,Tue May 5 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"If you remove enough unskilled labor, eventually even doctors would have to work fast food.  What do you think would happen if we removed all labor from the economy that was less skilled than doctors? With an economy of only doctors, many doctors would have to switch to doing all of the lower skill level jobs that would no longer have workers. Some would have to do the tasks nurses used to do. Others would have to become garbage men. Others would even have to serve coffee at fast food joints.   We all stand on each others shoulders on the economic ladder. In a tight labor market like ours, fewer low skilled workers at the bottom means fewer opportunities for high skilled workers to apply their skills at the top."
alberta,34xyor,HumanGoing_HG,30,Tue May 5 22:44:07 2015 UTC,My only issue with the TFW program is the temporary part.   If our country truly needs more labour then integrate them into our society so they can benefit from what they add.

alberta,34xyor,Solipsize,-9,Tue May 5 16:32:15 2015 UTC,The labor market is artificially capped. Drop borders and there won't be a problem with a shortage of workers.

It's not borders that are keeping people from coming here and working permanently - it's the fact that they cannot afford to live on the minimum wage precisely because producers want to keep wages low through things like the TFW. This is the engineered sham.
alberta,34xyor,Solipsize,-1,Tue May 5 18:19:25 2015 UTC,Well that pesky border (imaginary line) and immigration laws prevent natural levels of immigration not the free market. Barriers to entry like in anything favor the those who don't want to compete naturally.

But what's a more fair and feasible policy to draw in more permanent workers and close the labour gap: convincing the whole world to drop their borders and create one big organic free market (which we've been trying to do since the 80s anyways), or by letting the free market work the best it can with the system we've got?

alberta,34xyor,Ashlir,3,Tue May 5 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"I employ TFW and I literally get angry when people say the common myths about it. They're complaining about people that ABUSE the system.. but when it is adhered to (nobody seems to understand the rules that are actually in place and just goes by a few cbc stories for thier facts on it) then it is a very worthwhile program and does what it was supposed to do. Assholes abuse it, yes. But punishing everyone effects us all.   I have first hand experience with this as a business owner and I strongly disagree that eliminating TFW will benefit anyone, or very very few. I can only speak to the lower end- cooks and waitresses which is what I employ. It costs me MORE and is a pain to get the TFW but despite the common myth it's not like I'm avoiding Canadians. I hire every single person I can and put up with shit that nobody should have to because finding workers is impossible.  Simply put while our economy is hot they are a godsend. They are to be paid the same as any other person and for those that DON""T follow the rules- yes take away the TFW. But for most that pay them well/same it is an overall jobsaver and benefits everyone else to maintain less espensive food and services besides.   This ""oh just pay more"" argument is totally unworkable in real life. you can't pay $25 an hour for fast food.   For instance if I'm employing 25 people but I basically NEED the extra 4 TFW to keep my business running so I can have enough people on shift to run everyday.  I pay TFW the exact same as I would anyone else ($15 an hour for short order cooks) and I am in a very small town competing against the artificially high wages of the oilfield. If my business didn't exist you can't even get food on a sunday, no food after 9pm weekdays, etc.   These tax breaks and crap are urban myths, it is MORE expensive by far to employ a foreign worker anyways. I hear them over and over again but there's nothing to back that up."

alberta,350lak,lemonsqueezee,6,Wed May 6 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"I lived in BC during the NDP dynasty there. It was a debacle. An economic disaster. We went from ""have"" to ""have not"" very quickly. That's not even counting ""big [ill-advised and mismanaged] public works projects"" like the ""fast catamarans"" that lost millions and didn't even add usable ferries to the fleet.  Most of the people who voted for them bought their schtick of being for unions, working class people, etc. When they got in, they gave the environmental lobby carte blanche to screw over loggers and fishermen based on who screams loudest rather than who has a forestry degree. They totally bowed to the federal DFO when it came to fisheries management. They ducked and buckled when it came to offshore drilling, despite Hibernia, because somehow, according to the federal government, our offshore reserves should be considered forbidden fruit. Mines closed. Loggers spent more time idle than working. And companies were left economically vulnerable to later predation of US takeovers and buy-outs.   It isn't all the NDP's fault, but their resource mismanagement crippled logging companies during their tenure, and left them desperate to be gobbled up by huge American corporations that have no idea how to manage both the human and the resource capital.   And when they were finally ousted, they bragged that they'd balanced the budget, unlike any recent governments before them--well, yeah. They got a one-time, arbitrary windfall based on a 60% increase in at-the-pump gas prices, and all the sweet, sweet tax revenue that goes along with it. If it weren't for that, they'd have left with the biggest deficit in years, maybe decades.   Ontario went through something similar under Bob Rae. ""Have"" to ""have not"". In four years.   I know there are people here who have speculated that not all NDP governments are the same. Well, we'd better hope not.   EDIT: And just in case anyone is wondering if I'm one of those wealthy conservatives, when I was living in BC my family of two adults, three kids + child support for two others was living on just over $25k/year."

But hey, what do I know? I try to stay as neutral and unbiased as possible."

alberta,350lak,Starsy_02,3,Wed May 6 04:22:55 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, BC is a ""have"" province again. Took a while for the provincial Liberals to pull the province out of hock.   Incidentally, given the NDP have won a majority with only 40% of the popular vote, a similar thing happened in reverse at the start of the final term of NDP government in BC. The NDP won the election, but the BCLibs won not only the majority of the popular vote, but the largest share of the popular vote in the history of the province.   Every riding they won (mostly rural), they won in a landslide. Every riding they lost (mostly urban), they lost in a squeaker."
alberta,350lak,girlwriteswhat,4,Wed May 6 04:17:49 2015 UTC,"Who votes PC?  Those that are for the status quo...  It just so happens that the status quo went to shit, and the PCs had no back-up plan.  The NDP, to a certain degree, reinvented themselves.  The Alberta NDP are far more centrist than most NDP governments, and their economic platform is sound.    When the PCs raised taxes, the oil price fell, and they shot themselves in the foot with their corrupt dealings and the whole Wildrose merger-debacle, public opinion turned, harshly."
alberta,350lak,girlwriteswhat,2,Wed May 6 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"I was seriously pissed at the floor crossing that occurred. What a dickbag move. People who'd voted in a WildRose rep (probably because they were sick to death with PC corruption--dynasties always go stale eventually) were suddenly stuck with a PC one, against their will. I'm not certain, but I'd guess that every PC incumbent who was voted in as WildRose lost?  I'd like to believe you when you say the Alberta NDP are different. I would have preferred a minority NDP government, or a government with NDP as a strong official opposition against a minority PC or WR government. But I lived through NDP leadership, and oddly enough, it's often the working class that suffers most under them. People on welfare? Sure, they get some more entitlements. But my family lost tax breaks and subsidies as the working poor under an NDP government in BC."
alberta,350lak,girlwriteswhat,3,Wed May 6 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"People who vote PC are people who make good money and are more concerned with job security over helping their fellow man or providing social programs.  People who vote NDP are people who believe that rich people should be paying more to help those less fortunate, and likely believe that the rich are taking more than their fair share of oil revenues.  Wildrose are disenfranchised PC who still want low taxes.  Many are ignorant of oil prices in Saudi Arabia and frankly could care less, they see a shaky economy and blame the PC.  This is all subjective though, everyone has their own reasons, peer pressures, etc.."

alberta,34z3de,SriBri,27,Tue May 5 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"They're a young party without a lot of momentum and financial backing. There' not unpopular so much as they are unestablished, and I think they'll grow a fair amount over the next ten years, and begin to rally a sizable chunk of supporters. The reason there's nothing immediately offensive about them is because they're a fairly central party, which offers a moderate stance on most major issues. That's their central M.O., to offer a moderate alternative to the right/left schism that exists in the province right now, and provide a sort of political middle ground. While that's not a platform that particularly appeals to me as a traditionally left-leaning person, it's not one I'm opposed to either, and one I'm sure a lot of people will start leaning in favor of in future years.   Full Disclosure: Mostly talking out my ass based off the limited knowledge I have, and I encourage anyone with a more thorough understanding of the facts to prove me right or wrong so I can be informed too."
alberta,34z3de,Apotheosis91,4,Tue May 5 20:21:50 2015 UTC,They have had my vote since 2012 they are very close to the NDP on a few issues and pretty close to the liberals and green on others. Plus they seem to have a really nice platform that works with my views

I believe they've worked on polishing their image and hiding their darker bigoted side (although I think their stance is still socially conservative/reactionary at this point).

alberta,352o4h,Kaelteth,5,Wed May 6 18:15:05 2015 UTC,There is nothing in the platform about gun ownership.  I would expect no change.  I'm also a firearm owner and hunter.
alberta,352o4h,bawbzilla,2,Wed May 6 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I sincerely doubt it would come up. There are a lot of really big fish to fry before something as dead an issue as gun control would even be tinkered with. That being said, there was nothing in their platform about it, so it might be something they're just leaving to the Federal level."
alberta,352o4h,thequinox,2,Wed May 6 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"As /u/jonincalgary mentioned, gun control is a federal issue and I don't think the Alberta NDP will have much to do with it.  That being said, I am an NDP voter and plan on voting for them in the upcoming federal election as well. I recognize that might negatively impact me as a gun owner, but I won't vote right wing just to save my hobby as there are much more important things at stake.  I completely agree that most people don't understand gun control, and it's an easy win to slap on more anti-gun laws. We just need to work with our representatives and try to tell them that while we agree with their platform, that gun control in it's current state is not something we support and that we would appreciate an informed debate on the topic."
alberta,352o4h,thequinox,1 point,Wed May 6 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"Well said, I plan on voting NDP federally as well, however gun control has been a hangup on my changing voting choice for a while. Not because of the laws themselves but if a party genuinely feels that one gun is more dangerous than another (or any number of ill conceived laws we have) it shows me they only look at the surface of a problem and not the true issue (maybe just to get voter sympathy)... this may relate to other issues they vote on/table at senate.  Or is this just insane thinking?"
alberta,352o4h,Shwingbatta,2,Wed May 6 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"I can see that angle, yes, but it's also incredibly hard to be well informed on every issue.   There are going to be knee jerk anti-gun people out there. I get it, kids have been shot before, guns must be bad, we'll get rid of all the guns. It makes sense at first glance. Like you said once you dig deeper and start to see how hard it is to actually be gun free, the idea starts to fall apart.  Next you've got the politicians. These are going to be a mix of the above and others who know that it isn't going to help, but that it's a super easy thing to get the population behind. Look at this mean looking gun, we banned it, we're so much safer than before! Let's face it, it's an easy win. Gun enthusiasts who stand up just end up looking like rednecks because how can you argue guns are good?  It's really just a highly polarizing situation. As retarded as the anti-gun logic is, you've got total gun nuts on our side who make us all look bad. We end up battling over these two highly inflated positions when really all we need is a well thought out moderate approach.  Stop banning guns by name and instead control them based on real criteria. Want to keep all automatics prohibited? Fine. But stop banning guns based on their family or the way they look, and all the other ridiculous reasons they use to justify how one gun is worse than another. I'd 100% support a system that just fairly reclassified our firearms and got rid of the ""unless otherwise prohibited by name"" clause.  This is a bit of a rant now and I don't know where I'm going with this, but yeah. It's not going to change overnight, and the NDP will pose a challenge for sure. In the end it's hard to blame them though, as perceived as the increase in safety is by passing stricter gun laws, that perceived safety is up against a hobby, and that is hard to justify especially if people already have their minds made up.   Best we can do is keep talking about it openly when we can, and try to get our other gun friends not to keep voting Conservative just because they're scared. The Conservatives clearly don't care about our group that much, they just like to dangle the carrot whenever they need votes."

alberta,350zkh,bradboss,5,Wed May 6 05:02:06 2015 UTC,Are you legally registered as a small business?  If so enjoy things being literally no different for you whatsoever. If you hire new employees enjoy the tax credit.  Are you registered as a corporation?  If so look at your budget and move 2 more % into taxes. If you hire new employees enjoy the tax credit.
alberta,350zkh,electricsandstorm,4,Wed May 6 05:20:27 2015 UTC,Any corporation with profit under 500k are all classified as small business.
alberta,350zkh,zhantongz,4,Wed May 6 06:04:12 2015 UTC,"You're SO wrong. They plan to up the minimum wage from $10.20 to $15. This is a death sentence for small businesses.  Take for instance your typical restaurant. Costs are usually broken down like this (though they can vary)  30% Food Costs 30% Labour Costs 10% Rent 20% Overhead 5% Advertising 5% Profit (before taxes)  With minimum wage going up 47%, your labour costs bump up to 44% from 30%. So where do you make the cuts? Do you raise the price of you $10 special to $12? Do you go with lower quality ingredients, smaller portions? Or do you cut back staff? You'd need to cut about 1/3 to keep your profit margins similar.  But that's not even the biggest issue. Look at the tens of thousands of Albertans employed in big retail shops, making minimum, or near minimum wage. Do you know what the margins are for a place like Walmart?  74.75% COGS 19% SG&A 2% Other 1.25% Taxes 3% Profit    Of SG&A, about half is wages, or 10% of revenue. A 44% increase bumps labour to 14.4%. That means you're going in the hole 0.75%/year. They can't really cut COGS anymore than it is. You need profit. So do you raise prices 4.4%? Or cut staff by 1/3? Or a combination of the two? You know which one they'll do. They'll just put in more self checkouts and fire the minions. And this analysis doesn't even take into account the 20% increase in provincial corporate tax on large businesses.  So expect to see prices starting to rise across the board, as companies try to brace for $15 minimum wage. This also has a compounding effect. The greenhouse labour goes up, so the vegetable price goes up. Then the delivery driver's wage goes up, so the vegetable price goes up. Then the retailers wage goes up, so the vegetable price goes up.   Start off with a $5 bag of potators. 30% of greenhouse costs are wages, which will go up 44%, so add 14% to the price of the vegetable ($5.70). Trucking labour costs are ~36%, which would go up 16%, bringing that bag of potatoes to $6.61. Now the retailer's wage has gone up, adding 4.4% to the cost, which takes us to $6.90. That's a total increase of about 38%.  Very simplified post, I know. But it's not like it's going to have zero impact. There are real effects for all companies, big and small, when you jack up minimum wage by 44%."
alberta,350zkh,bsbbtnh,0,Wed May 6 08:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yes this may seem drastic, but I would not sweat too much, if history has showed us anything it is that this will not happen overnight nor will it happen over 4 years.   I voted NDP, I traditionally vote PC, this is a big tide to turn and it will take the ship a long time to change course. The NDP will not do this over night it will be implemented over time and the results will be weighed along the way and the course adjusted as needed. Anything but this would be suicide for the NDP, they may have won, but that doesn't mean they won't be under the microscope."

alberta,34yn88,alonghardlook,0,Tue May 5 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"As with voting for candidates, the problem comes down to a single choice answer. Humans are not single celled organisms - we have multiple varying interests, goals and desires.   With a little reworking, you can take the example status that you provided, and create multiple choices instead of single choices.  ""On a scale of 1-10, rank how satisfied you would be with the following corporate tax rates (0, 1, 2, etc)""  Something like that allows for more of the nuanced realities of life. And with that, the answer is simple; you go with what will numerically provide the most satisfaction.   If 20% of people said 10/10 on 0% tax, with slow trickling up to 10%, and 30% said 10/10 on 10%, with numbers in the 11-12 range, then you can see immediately how much better representative this would be. It's the same reason FPTP doesn't work."
alberta,34yn88,wanked_in_space,17,Tue May 5 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is, none of those parties really represent what I actually want. Not really. Not completely.    You can't find a party that really, completely represents what you want?  Ha. I challenge you to find even a single person, other than yourself, that really, completely represents what you want. You won't.  The goal is to find a party with your core values, that may disagree on things that are less important to you.  There are 5 major parties and then some other random. How do you expect millions of people to fit in exactly into 5.  Completely agree with you on FPTP. I've voted 4 times in federal elections, 2 times provincially in Alberta, and this is honestly the first time I'm voting for a candidate I support rather than strategic voting, and I've voted for the party I support once in that time. How's that for democracy?"
alberta,34yn88,alpacIT,2,Tue May 5 20:04:03 2015 UTC,I don't want to choose between templates that don't fit me and what I believe in. All of the parties have some dumb policy or ideal that I don't agree with. All of them are making grand promises that will be impossible to deliver on.   Then start a party and run for office yourself...
alberta,34yn88,tedcorp,1 point,Tue May 5 18:51:28 2015 UTC,Definitely thinking about something like that.
alberta,34yn88,staticred,2,Tue May 5 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"If everyone thought like this, it would definitely break the system in two.  You cannot think your voice doesn't matter.  Every single voice matters.  That's how it works.  What voting does is allows you to stand in the same place you're speaking from and debate issues as they arise, after the election.  A spoiled ballot sends a quieter message than a good one.  As for not being able to find a platform that fits your personal, unique point of view *perfectly *...c'mon now...there are but three actual, viable, well constructed platforms here (and even that's a stretch...I hope we don't end up with student MLA's because parties had to bolster their caucuses) so do this today, or next time:  -Pick your most important points and scan each platform for their point of view on it.  If you agree with them, point added...if you don't, then no point.  No party...ever...will get all of your points but the platform you can live with is the one that scores the highest.  Your point of view sounds...young.  May I venture this is your first election?  If it is...you'll get better at knowing the histrionics of each party and be able to wade through the banter with ease.  They rarely stray from their own core."
alberta,34yn88,swiftb3,1 point,Tue May 5 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"Vote for the candidate in your riding that best represents your views. It's not pointless, even if your candidate doesn't win, it's just democracy in action.  You might want to look at each party's stance on FPTP (quickly!) - it could be that in voting for a different party than your gut feels is right may, in the long run, lead towards proportional voting or another alternative to FPTP. In which case, it does end up being a win for you."
alberta,34yn88,swiftb3,1 point,Tue May 5 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'm actually closest to the Alberta Party, and I really do like their platform, but unfortunately, I don't live in Calgary-Elbow, which appears the be the only candidate with a real chance.  My optimal party would have parts of the AB, NDP, PC, and even aspects of the WR.  But I grew up in the US and it's far better than having only two parties, both of which suck, to choose from."
alberta,34yn88,jonos360,2,Tue May 5 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah no question, the two party system is stupid. But FPTP will lead to that, no question.   I was really thinking the same thing. There are parts of all those parties that I like. There are parts that I think are important on all those platforms. And then I thought ""I can't be the only one thinking this.""  And to be honest, I thought about running. And running something like a ""Technology Party"" - the idea being that if you use a framework similar to reddit, every person could be heard on issues. Obviously it would need work and need figuring out, but I honestly think that the internet/social communications and information technology have the power to change the way in which we as humanity operate in democracy, and really allow every voice to be heard."
alberta,34yn88,Hemlochs,1 point,Tue May 5 19:28:44 2015 UTC,I've got a pretty good ABP candidate in my riding and quite a few people are planning on voting for her. In my opinion not voting for someone because you think they don't have a chance is the main reason they don't have a chance. My father for example voted PC since Lougheed and doesn't trust the WR so he and many of his neighbours are voting for the ABP.

alberta,34z1rv,cornyorange,3,Tue May 5 19:12:42 2015 UTC,"I’ve emailed about this.  In short, it does effect smokeless products.  However, importing and buying outside of the province is legal.   The only thing you should be worried about is if you intended to sell it, possession is still legal."
alberta,34z1rv,LukeTheGreek,2,Tue May 5 22:33:04 2015 UTC,awesome. Well not really. Your answer was awesome. The ban is bullshit. Thanks anyhow bud
alberta,34z1rv,kmutch,2,Tue May 5 22:48:49 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel. I bought a store out on Sunday night.
alberta,34z1rv,SweetJimmyK,1 point,Wed May 6 04:31:47 2015 UTC,"So if this affects smokeless products, does that include vaping products?"
alberta,34z1rv,LukeTheGreek,1 point,Wed May 6 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"I think so. Though you could probably debate there is no tobacco and only nicotine. My inquiry pertained to shisha, but you could probably send an email inquiring about vaping; I find their responses decently prompt."
alberta,34z1rv,swiftb3,2,Wed May 6 01:18:15 2015 UTC,I would imagine that it's a ban on sales.  Stockpiling shouldn't be an issue.

alberta,34ybjv,darkstar107,16,Tue May 5 15:58:42 2015 UTC,"I voted NDP because their platform aligns closest with my views, and because I really like Rachel Notley.  I didn't vote PC because I think it's unhealthy for a province to have the same government for so long. Change is good. Also because of all the PC fiascos that have taken place recently. They've lost my trust.  Didn't vote for the liberals because they're not really a player in this election.  Didn't vote WR because I disagree with much of their platform, especially their plans for education. And because I still haven't quite gotten over the whole ""gays burn in hell"" thing that was an issue last election."

A PC Branch that has members flip flop back and forth? Scary. Alberta Party: See Liberal rationell. PC's: Absolute power corrupting absolutely. They may have served us well in the past, but the last while has been very bumpy. I have no trust in them. NDP: The best fit considering my viewpoint on the rest. I'm excited for change and the benefits we can see. :-)"
alberta,34ybjv,TheKrs1,3,Tue May 5 17:40:43 2015 UTC,My only concerns with the NDP is their track record in previous provinces and the hike in corporate taxes.  Alberta has grown a lot because of the low corporate taxes and raising them 2% could be bad for our economy...especially with how fragile the oil business is at the moment.  If they were to only raise corporate taxes .5% or 1% I'd be much less hesitant. Even if the corporate tax increase was gradual over the next couple years it'd help our economy a lot more than an immediate hike.  What are your thoughts on the NDP's history with other provinces?
alberta,34ybjv,lemonsqueezee,10,Tue May 5 17:50:28 2015 UTC,Weren't corporate tax rates something like 15% when Ralph Klein was in power?
alberta,34ybjv,JasminefromCanada,5,Tue May 5 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. 15.5%, to be more exact."
alberta,34ybjv,amnes1ac,3,Tue May 5 18:48:32 2015 UTC,You're right.  I didn't know that.  Looks like BC is the next lowest at 11% with every other province being between 12 and 16%.  Maybe I'm wrong to be concerned about the 2% increase.  Edit: Ontario and NWT are at 11.5%
alberta,34ybjv,canadian1296,4,Tue May 5 19:33:21 2015 UTC,Don't believe the propaganda. I'm a small business owner and I would barely notice a 2% tax hike.
alberta,34ybjv,amnes1ac,2,Tue May 5 21:11:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input...much appreciated!
alberta,34ybjv,alpacIT,2,Tue May 5 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"Small business taxes remain constant anyway, only corporate taxes go up 2%. Additionally, both can get credit for hiring additional new employees as far as I know."
alberta,34ybjv,Hemlochs,1 point,Wed May 6 06:39:15 2015 UTC,"I know that. I'm just saying that if it did apply, it wouldn't affect me whatsoever."
alberta,34ybjv,Solipsize,1 point,Wed May 6 06:46:30 2015 UTC,My only concerns with the NDP is their track record in previous provinces   What does that have to do with the Alberta NDP?
alberta,34ybjv,shitlordin,5,Tue May 5 19:08:34 2015 UTC,Good question...does it have anything at all to do with Alberta NDP?  I'm no expert in politics by any means; I bring it up only to get input on the topics.
alberta,34ybjv,Zixen,2,Tue May 5 19:22:44 2015 UTC,You have a good attitude.  I like you.
alberta,34ybjv,shitlordin,2,Tue May 5 19:59:14 2015 UTC,"Hopefully not, if the AB NDP stick to their guns. For example, Bob Rae's ON NDP lost their base by adopting fiscally conservative policies (see the 'Rae Days'). The NS NDP fell into ill favour because they didn't meet the impossible promise they made of balancing the budget without raising taxes in a recession. If Notley remains truly progressive we have no reason to believe that other NDP governments reflect poorly on hers, more than the generaly untrustworthiness of politicians (cough-Prentice)"
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,13,Tue May 5 20:28:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the WR on almost every single issue. I despise the conservatives and the liberal party is not really a player in this election. I am voting NDP because their views align with my own and if they win this provincial election it may push some fence sitters around the country to vote NDP in the federal election. If the PC's lose their western fortress my hope is they collapse in on themselves like a dying star.  The truth is, this election I would vote for any party that had a chance to boot the cons out. I hate them that much."
alberta,34ybjv,CanadianWizardess,2,Tue May 5 17:40:54 2015 UTC,A real irony of this election if the NDP win is that it is extremely unlikely to change how Alberta ends up voting federally but could convince some Liberal voters to swing more NDP. A change that in places like Ontario could led to a Conservative majority.
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,1 point,Tue May 5 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"That is true, although I do know a lot of rural folks who have been conservatives for generations that are saying NDP all the way. Granted that is just from a single persons observation but I have been hearing a lot of grumbling from old timers about the current federal government.   My hope is you are wrong and that Alberta changes its tone federally, so at the VERY LEAST the conservatives realize they actually have to consider the voters wants/needs.  I am very excited to see the results tonight, I wouldn't be surprised if we get another conservative government though."
alberta,34ybjv,MorgothEatsUrBabies,-2,Tue May 5 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"The one thing the Wildrose has that I like is that they are the only pro-conscience rights. I disagree with most of the rest of their platform. I just wish other groups would be pro-rights  *Edit- I should clarify: I absolutely think it should be illegal to refuse a patient based off their colour, sexuality, etc. I just don't think it should be illegal to ask that the patient wait until the doctor that is comfortable performing abortions is available. I know someone who is no longer a pharmacist because she was sued for asking patients to wait half an hour for a pharmacist comfortable with dispensing Plan B clock back in"
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,9,Tue May 5 18:14:06 2015 UTC,...That's one of the things that scares me most about their platform. A doctor should absolutely not have the right to refuse service to a gay person (or whatever example you want to insert here) because of their personal prejudices. Do your damn job.
alberta,34ybjv,concededline,1 point,Tue May 5 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with it is that my wife is in sonagraphy, and we are both pro-choice (her much more so). With a concience clause, if she is asked guide an abortion via ultrasound she can ask that someone else does it. Without it, if she asks that someone else do it, or refer the person to a different hospital assuming she is the only ultrasound tech working that night, she can be sued and/or lose her sonagraphy license. I don't have an issue with it being illegal to refuse a patient based on the patient, I have an issue with it being illegal to refuse a procedure you are uncomfortable with. My wife went in to Healthcare to heal, not harm.  For example, we have a family friend who worked in a drop-in clinic. At one point, she was the only pharmacist on, since others were on break. She had a sign on her desk explaining that she cannot dispense Plan B, since it is against her beliefs, but pharmacist's that will will be back at [one hour later], and left a list of other places that can dispense it. A patient freaked out about this and sued her. After being dragged through the legal system and all its costs, she can no longer practice, and is now a stay-at-home mom."
alberta,34ybjv,MorgothEatsUrBabies,4,Tue May 5 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"My wife went in to Healthcare to heal, not harm.   The problem here isn't anybody's right to refuse anything, it's that you consider an abortion as harmful."
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,3,Tue May 5 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"An abortion is not harmful to the parent, but is 100% harmful to the fetus. If a procedure is considered by half the population to be murder, and/or goes against the hypocratic oath (ie a Healthcare worker's job description), then the worker should have the right to say ""Could you get x doctor to do it instead please?"""
alberta,34ybjv,MorgothEatsUrBabies,1 point,Tue May 5 21:42:19 2015 UTC,That's your belief on the topic other people believe that the fetus is a baby. It doesn't matter which one you believe people are entitled to their opinions.
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,2,Tue May 5 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, everyone's entitled to their opinion on the subject. But this isn't a debate of opinion, this is about healthcare services delivery. If you work in an establishment that conducts abortions AND it is in your job description to perform tasks related to abortions, you have to be prepared to perform those tasks.   I don't think it's ok for healthcare workers to negatively affect patient care because of their own beliefs. If there's no one else there to do it, tough luck. Suck it up and do your job."
alberta,34ybjv,Necrostopheles,1 point,Tue May 5 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"It goes against the hippocratic oath- the oath you are required to swear before you can become a doctor. It's like making it illegal for a civil engineer to fail an inspection plan they deem unsafe if the customer knows it is and doesn't care.   Not only this, but it is a completely elective procedure. Healthcare worker's aren't your slaves- they shouldn't be required to do whatever elective procedure you feel the whim for. If your procedure is elective,  you should hack to find someone willing to do it"
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,2,Tue May 5 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"Clearly, I disagree. If you don't like your job or what your job description entails, you're free to search for a different job. In that case, finding a clinic/hospital that doesn't offer the procedure she doesn't want to perform.  I don't get your civil engineering comparison. It's not illegal to fail an unsafe design, why would it ever be? It doesn't even relate."
alberta,34ybjv,shitlordin,1 point,Tue May 5 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"It relates 100%. Refusing to do something you aren't comfortable with. There's no chance it'll ever be illegal, and Healthcare should follow.  Now, the problem with moving to a different job that doesn't require you to do such procedures is finding these position. As well, when most doctors became doctors, this was not part of the job description, and the hippocratic oath seemed to guarantee that they wouldn't ever have to. Are you saying anyone who invested hundreds of thousands in education should just suck it up and quit? Who does this even help? How does having fewer Healthcare worker's help anyone? They're already overworked as it is"
alberta,34ybjv,ArguablyTasty,1 point,Tue May 5 23:06:07 2015 UTC,"If I'm against smoking but work at a store that sells cigarettes, should I find another employee to sell them cigarettes, or would I simply get fired for refusing to do my job?"
alberta,34ybjv,alpacIT,1 point,Wed May 6 03:34:59 2015 UTC,Is selling cigarettes a huge controversy as to whether it's considered murder or not?
alberta,34ybjv,kang3157,5,Wed May 6 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"I do like the idea of reducing government footprint. Too bad I don't believe anything they say.

alberta,34ybjv,Kooky_kanooa,1 point,Tue May 5 18:23:48 2015 UTC,I didn't want them to win (happy they didnt). I just wanted them to have enough seats for the topic to be brought up
alberta,34ybjv,concededline,3,Wed May 6 07:30:53 2015 UTC,I voted NDP because Rachel Notley is a Game of Thrones fan.  To be honest though it was the reasonable platform they proposed compared to the Wildrose cut everything and the PC cut everything and raise taxes on everyone except businesses. No one else had candidates in my riding.

People respond to the vile, hateful comments you make.  It was not long ago that you said this to me;   You support Harper's disgusting treatment of the military. You support the fact that 150 Canadian soldiers died under Harper's leadership. You can't wait for him to send more to die. You put your precious beloved Kurds on a pedestal, the very same ones who killed a Canadian soldier and then blamed him for his death. You support Harper eviscerating Canada's military budget down to below 1% of GDP, the lowest level in Canadian history. Judging by what I've seen from you, you hate the Canadian military and veterans. You can't wait to send more Canadians soldiers into harm's way.

Even if he is wrong, and you disagree with him, once you've made your logical and reasonable political arguments that's it. None of this personal shaming of people who disagree with you.

alberta,3510v7,EPOSZ,-3,Wed May 6 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"Good for fucking you, out enforcing the moral standards of the interwebs on behalf of a belligerent, ignorant ass who spends his time making bold, blanket statements based on the most facile, superficial analysis imaginable.  Oh, by the way, political discourse doesn't require we pretend all views are of equal value. At some point we need to call bullshit - both about bad ideas and about stupid people.  So, while you're making sure no one is fucking offended how about you keep your let's-all-get-along-kumbaya bullshit to yourself.   The rest of us are allowed to mock the trolls. They've earned it. And most of them - here included - were never interested in discourse anyway. But you'd know that if you'd bothered to do five minutes of research before chiming in with some dumbass opinion based antiquated notions of scholarly debate and freedom of thought."
alberta,3510v7,Xeronian,6,Wed May 6 06:37:29 2015 UTC,"I never, ever said that all opinions and views must be considered equal.  I am specifically saying that making a post to mock and shame a single user over his offensive views is not necessary.  If he is truly wrong it'll be proven beyond whatever he can say over the next 4 years. This post is just a targeted attack and I dislike that.   Secondly please expand on your point about my notions and what research you're referring to. Researching TexasNorth's views and statements or about scholarly debate? Is it my discomfort with targeted posts like this that's antiquated?"
alberta,3510v7,FoundOnPerihelion,-1,Wed May 6 07:08:01 2015 UTC,"The post wasn't shaming him it was mocking him. And who cares what you think? Does the post violate the rules? If so a moderator can deal with it. If not, why do you think you get to be the moral arbiter?  The post isn't about the next four years, it's about the visceral experience of a political loss. One he was gloating about only hours earlier.  By 'research' I meant read his posts. He has awful, uninformed things to say about many groups and expounds at great length. So he can ""call out"" entire groups with gross generalizations and vulgar sentiments but no one can respond to him directly? Please.  What's antiquated is your belief that you have some right to lecture others on the boundaries of moral or political discourse on an anonymous fucking chat board.  Also, your ideas about state ownership of corporations or resource businesses I are deeply flawed and silly. Take a look at Saskatchewan's Crowns which are spectacularly well managed and successful.  Oil would be no different. Hell, Harper would never nationalize our oil, but he's fine with the Chinese doing so through their wildly powerful state owned and operated oil firm.  That a few underdeveloped Latin American and Balkan nations lacked the stability and acumen to succeed does not imply the model is unworkable - it implies that competent management and adherence to rules and good practice are still necessary, as opposed to bribery, graft and largesse.  To claim those negative features come naturally with government is just a silly canard for those too lazy or dull for nuance.  And yes, governments take money out of state owned businesses - money that can be spent on the public (infrastructure, services, savings, etc.).  I don't see what's wrong with this? Shareholders take money out of businesses - that's the point of businesses. And of shareholders.  If money is being made on a public resource or essential service I'd rather it was made by the state for my benefit - even if only tangentially - than by stock traders and shareholders in far off financial capitals and in foreign lands. Accountability is the key and the argument that private sector profit motives always generate better results is utter nonsense.  That's all."
alberta,3510v7,Xeronian,4,Wed May 6 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Your replies so far seem pretty ""moral arbiter"" oriented in their own right, although you claim that you don't believe anyone should do that. You've added a couple big posts lecturing me already, but apparently this okay so long as the views are yours or shared by you.  As for TexasNorth, I totally agree with you that people should be able to directly respond to his ridiculous comments. But respond, not make a targeted post with no purpose other than to provoke him (as you said mocking him, not opening a discussion).  In reference to previous comments I've made, which I guess we're getting into, my point with state owned resource companies is that if the company operates by using government debt and/or printed funds then the people own that debt and inflation to. It's great to be able to take the cash flow off the state company to pay for operational and capital expenses, but many of the Latin American countries ignore or downplay the massive debt the companies are racking up. It's not sustainable from a company standpoint or as a taxpayer - at some point the company might grind to a halt with its books in a mess.   I'll be clear, I am not against crown corporations. I'm quite familiar with SK's crown corporations and I'm a huge fan of SGI and SaskTel. In fact I believe that insurance should be government run in Alberta. If you're required by legislation to have it, the gov should also run it. SaskTel is a great example of the challenge of having a large province with low population density, yet needing to keep them connected. There was no company that would take up the challenge so SK said ""fine then we'll do it our damn selves"" and it's worked out great.   But these kind of corporations provide benefit to the population in a more direct and different way than a resource extraction company. So much money needs to be recycled to keep an oil company going that using it as a cash cow is very difficult to do.   You're right in saying failures of the model in politically unstable countries doesn't prove the model can't work.  But I do believe it adds evidence to the fact that it is not simple to do and in a country like Canada would need to be modified to work. If nothing else, it shows a few examples of what not to do.   edit Sorry one last thing. There is actually evidence to support my claims that private motives result in better financial health and returns for companies in the filings of public companies when compared to publicly disclosed state companies. Public companies that thrive and survive can't run with the same levels of debt or poor balance sheets as state companies can. A state company can be in ruins and hemorrhage  money or be ineffective with tax money but they don't get shut down. They ca  continue like that until a government decides to reform it or sell it to industry for immediate return."

Move or change them.  Consider yourself lucky to live in a world where you have the freedom to make those changes.  Don't like the governing party and it's influence on your world?  Vote.  Tonight is a shining example of that principle.  Al-fucking-berta voting majority NDP!  No, in a democracy, you won't get everything you want or everything you vote for.  But by voting for what you stand for, you are at least making that effort to try to make the change you want happen."
alberta,3518db,SDR184,1 point,Wed May 6 07:55:44 2015 UTC,"This is far from nihilist.  I love my home, and watching politicians regardless of their platform make it worse with each day is very disappointing.  You say to vote and potentially support a change of governing parties... who should I vote for?  None of them are qualified to govern us.  I would happily support a politician that would share my views.  Sadly, none exist.  My views are not compatible with a politician's career.  Should I run for office and abandon the life that I seek to protect?  Even if I won with 100% of my riding, what would I change, one voice against many?  Nothing.  Or should I move, again abandoning the life that I seek to protect?  To where?  To another province with the exact same parties, and the exact same problem?  Another country?

alberta,3518db,MCPEN15,3,Wed May 6 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"Minority governments do happen, and the best way to do that is if you are fringe, don't be afraid to vote fringe. Even the NDP was a fringe party, no exception made for Alberta.   The Alberta party got their leader elected, and Swann was elected as well. That's a win.  So that's five. It is as complete a political spectrum as there is in America. Don't be afraid to help prepare these parties for any by-elections that may happen, or if another early election were to be called.  We have the most likely large party to advocate reform in power right now.   Progress will be made."

Or they barter their votes, which subverts democracy just the same."

Where the call to decline the vote is effective is as an appeal to PC voters, who are disgusted with the current government, but who can't bring themselves to vote for anyone else.  You are exercising the right to vote, and make the intentions of your vote clearly known.  If you spoil your ballot, they can't tell whether or not you are an idiot, so those truly get ignored.

For all the years until now, many ridings really only had PC as a real option. None of the rejected votes counted until now have mattered for anything.

But I'm going to put more effort into the people who voted against me, but are willing to support me if our political views match or are close enough.  The people who declined their vote have shown the effort to recruit them might be for nothing and better put somewhere else. I'm not saying they would be completely ignored, but it would be hard to know how close our political views have to match before they finally decide to vote for me. And unlike those who vote against me, worse case scenario they vote for no one.  But this is a topic people can easily disagree on.

alberta,34vmmi,manamal,6,Tue May 5 02:23:20 2015 UTC,They agree on democratic reform and environmental issues.  I also think they could collaborate on healthcare reform.
alberta,34vmmi,LordDwia,2,Tue May 5 07:35:19 2015 UTC,"Democratic reform, yes. Environmental issues, no. While they both state that they believe in environmental reform, I see the Wildrose as placing business first, and the environment will take a back seat at that point.  The only way I can see them collaborating on healthcare reform is when looking at how to make the system more efficient for front-line staff. The Wildrose have been ardent supporters of a two-tiered healthcare system, though, and the NDP are strongly against that. So I can't see them finding any middle ground on that particular issue.  Of course, all of this is operating under the assumption that the NDP win. I'm actually kind of curious to see if the Wildrose would be OK working with the NDP at all."
alberta,34vmmi,manamal,2,Tue May 5 08:31:09 2015 UTC,The wild rose has a practical approach to environmental issues like accelerating the decommissioning of coal power. Elaborate schemes like carbon capture are another form of corporate welfare ripe with corruption and mismanagement.
alberta,34vmmi,toddgak,-32,Tue May 5 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"The wildrose should not work with the NDP on anything unless they want to lower taxes and increase our rights as citizens and businesses free from government control. That is what made Alberta prosperous. That's what the Wildrose stands for and that's what I believe in. When the NDP destroys Alberta, the Wildrose will be there to take over and undo all the damage caused by the NDP stupid economic policies that never worked. Raising corporate tax will destroy businesses. Business owners will never be able to afford to hire anyone because of the greedy NDP that needs more money for unions and big parties/celebrations for themselves. Socialists are only good for wasting other people's money. This is basic economics that the NDP does not understand. More taxes always leads to a worse economy. I did NOT escape Obama's socialist experiment down south for this. There are NO JOBS because of what socialism is doing there."

Perhaps it will still happen if everyone wakes up and sees Wildrose platform is the best for Alberta. If not please be a powerful opposition. We cannot let them push through their minimum wage bill.

alberta,34vmmi,sir_ramen,6,Tue May 5 12:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not true. Minimum wage increases have never destroyed the economy in the past, despite dire warnings coming from people like yourself every time an increase occurs. The idea that a minimum wage increase would be ""overpriced for 30% years"" is based on a simplistic understanding of how an economy operates. No need for the doom and gloom."
alberta,34vmmi,broccolifucker,-4,Tue May 5 12:45:01 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess you've never done a payroll or figured out a price on your cost of goods.

alberta,34vmmi,sir_ramen,5,Tue May 5 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"You can guess whatever you would like. Obviously labour costs are a factor, but they are not the only factor. A business is more likely to be profitable if the general population has a higher amount of spending power, since they can, you know, spend money at your business. Like I said, you're basing your ideas on simplistic and shortsighted economic thinking.  And no, it is not ""known"" that unemployment and business failures go up whenever the minimum wage increase. That's just a kind of right-wing folksy wisdom that is not supported by evidence. Generally speaking, minimum wage increases are a net gain for economies.  Perhaps your business will close, perhaps not. But it is a little premature to start threatening it now. Are you also going to stop donating to charities too? I'm sure you won't need to close your business if profits start going up too. But honestly, stop with the fear spreading. ""I'm going to shut down my business and we're all going to end up working for the government!"" Give me a break."

The  results make clear arguments that it is detrimental to the economy and hurts the people you're trying to help. It's only common sense to someone who's in business and has nothing to do with ""folksy wisdom "".   Don't bother replying, I'm done arguing with you idealistic idiots."
alberta,34vmmi,yolo_swagovic2,7,Tue May 5 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"I have and believe it or not, I've actually studied economics more deeply then ""fucken Google searches."" As I've said, never before has a minimum wage increase tanked our economy and they have generally been net gains overall. Of course, reading only right-wing blogs or whatever you've encountered in your ""fucken Google searches"" probably doesn't take that into account. They often neglect to consider actual numbers and evidence and instead rely on uncritical ""business common-sense"" (which by the way, is basically the definition of right wing folksy wisdom.)  Anyway, good luck with your business. I sincerely hope that the apocalypse that will obviously start if the NDP get elected won't immediately force you to close shop."

Try to go off these unbiased opinions and not the information the party sells you.  http://www.votecompass.com/ is pretty cool for a simple test, but make sure you double check how your responses were counted at the end. I used it during the last federal election and it worked well, but this time the back end messed up and a lot of my answers were changed to something else upon hitting finish."
alberta,34xztn,toddgak,9,Tue May 5 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"There seem to be two parts to your post.  The first is that all the platforms sound the same to you, because ""everyone wants to fund more healthcare and schools"". Except that, when you look at the platforms, every party is looking to do this in a different way, to a different extent. The choices for healthcare and education funding are more complex than just ""more"" or ""less"", there's also ""where does the funding go"", ""where does it come from"", ""how much"", ""why"", and ""when"".  As the other poster mentioned, you do have to look past the spin. NDP claims PCs cut education, but they only ""cut"" in that they increased the budget by less than a metric the NDP feels is important. But most major party's platforms have been divided on the details of how they would find healthcare and schools.  Now, as for electoral promises being broken, yeah, it happens. Politicians don't follow through on all their promises, and sometimes they get into office to find they physically can't. But when you look at someone's past voting record you can get an idea of what they've tried to do in the past, and when you look at their promises, you can get at least an idea of where they're going.  I mean, NDP, Wildrose, and PCs all have rough budgets tabled. These aren't just vague promises to do more, these are documents with ""we will put $X money into Y, and $Z money into AA""."
alberta,34xztn,toddgak,3,Tue May 5 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"This is a great point. But, sometimes (actually most times), when the government talks about money, and how much they are willing to spend on certain things (healthcare, school funding etc.), I honestly can't get a good grasp of how much money they even have in the first place.   It's not like a simple bank account that you can just look at and say ""lets split the funds up this way"". It's such a large amount of money. How would I ever know how they should spend their money if I don't even know how much they have? Is there a way to find this information?  I constantly hear that the government is in debt, but then I also hear/read that they are always making new purchases that are being debated about.   Also, is there a website that has a history of the elected parties in the past (obviously not the newer parties), that can give a good idea about what they accomplished or what they messed up on?   Maybe I'm just too new to all of this (I'm 24) to really understand. I've read all of the platforms and I just feel like they sound so similar. I know that it's already voting day, but it would be great if I could find some information (that the parties DID NOT write) that could help me to better understand, even if it's just for my own knowledge, not for voting.  Sorry to ramble, this has been a frustrating topic for me for a while now. I really appreciate all the answers."
alberta,34xztn,Think8437,5,Tue May 5 17:51:59 2015 UTC,The difference will be how they try to pay for it.  I feel Conservatives like to promise the moon and then dial back to minimum required.

If we can't believe most of what their platforms say (In a perfect world, we would), and if I have only voted twice, how am I truly supposed to understand how to make this decision. I guess I just need more years under my belt. There is only one party that stands out in a good way, and who knows if they even mean what they say.

alberta,34u8kj,Oilfan94,1 point,Tue May 5 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"I'm also a professional photographer and I can't say that I've every removed a 'bum chin', but I know how easy it would be.    I have removed moles and other such 'permanent' features.  I have removed or smoothed out wrinkles.  I have trimmed fat and reshaped bodies.    Each time I do it, I consider the ethics of it.  Why am I doing it?  Will the client like it better or worse?  Am I giving the impression that they are not good enough as is? Do they understand the issues and are they OK with it?  I believe there is a time and place for 'heavier editing'...even if it's lower on the ethical scale.    So I guess I'm saying that this isn't really an issue of right or wrong....it's a large grey area.  Are the photos in question trying to deliberately fool someone, or misrepresent someone?  I don't think so.    Like I said, I'd guess that it was just a case of a photographer or editor that got a little too clicky with the spot removal tool or healing brush.  They probably didn't give it too much thought....and that was their mistake."

Am I giving the impression that they are not good enough as is?   I like to make people look like they imagine themselves to look on a good day.

They expect us to foot the bill for this even though it is 95% their own mismanagement and they can get the money elsewhere.  The NDP actually have a functioning budget with realistic numbers. And plan to decrease our foolish reliance on a single industry. If we keep doing the same thing we are doing now, eventually it will kick us in the arse hard. The NDP have put actual thought into the inevitable tax raise, and their plan puts us in a more stable long term position.  Frankly, I would probably vote PC if they had a plan which didn't perpetuate the same problems they've been managing on and off for 44 years. But it is time to diversify and become a better province.

Because if they actually believed that, would they not redirect the pile of money they say they will spend promoting refinery projects and upgrader projects, into economic diversification? Those oil/gas projects will get built when the demand is there regardless. Plus to promote such projects but not the pipelines to transport them is shooting yourself in the foot."
alberta,34z7yb,OPsEvilTwin_S_,1 point,Tue May 5 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"Diversification seems to be another big topic- which I understand. AB has a huge dependance on O&G. My question is how do you effectively diversify? Every platform said they wanted to diversify. How is NDP convincing everyone that they can do it better? By taxing the already successful industries to fuel the... other industries that have not thrived because there isn't an economic demand for them?  I guess my view point comes strictly from economics. Supply and demand. If I can get a return for investing, I will do it- common sense. So then why, in the past 25 years or so, has no one started ""diversifying"" on their own? Surely it can't be because there is no return? Help me understand."
alberta,34z7yb,Kaelteth,-1,Wed May 6 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"Refinery projects are a good first step towards diversifying, it doesn't happen over night and we have a population which is very oil savvy. I'll admit, it doesn't end our dependence on oil tomorrow, but it is a first step towards a less one-resource economy.  In the longer term (and I know they haven't said this specifically), AB really needs to get some stronger non-resource commerce going. Tech, or research, or something like that.  The NDP do not oppose all pipelines categorically (if they did I would also say that is a deal breaker). They don't even oppose northern gateway, but northern gateway is a pipe dream (pun not intended) at this point. We have so much fighting to get that passed that it is basically pointless at this point.  http://www.630ched.com/2015/04/25/alberta-ndp-defends-its-stance-on-oil-pipelines/  That article mentions that Notley supports other pipelines which will actually stand a chance to be built before hell freezes over."
alberta,34z7yb,rustyredtruck,1 point,Wed May 6 00:53:52 2015 UTC,Supply and demand. That's all that really needs to be said here. So unless Ndp has a magic recipe to increase demand to the point of justifying more refineries. And also convince the east and Americans to buy our refined product (when they can produce their own cheaper) it's all talk.

alberta,34z7yb,electricsandstorm,1 point,Tue May 5 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things about PC's I enjoy.  But their social policies are outdated.  That's my biggest reason, but it's not the only one.  They are a party that seems to have lost their ability to plan and create good government.  They now use threats and fear to win.  They don't have a strong platform right now, and they've mismanaged Alberta in such a way that the current oil ""crisis"" is hurting Albertan's a lot more than it should be.  The PC's used to be a party that brought a high quality of life to Albertan's.  That's gone (also federally).  It's probably been gone for a while but I never saw it until recent years.  Alberta should not ever have to see a deficit.  The PC's have let us down as a people.  That, along with their weakening platform, is why I won't vote for them.  So now I choose who to vote for.  The NDP make a lot of promises.  Sure a lot of them might not make it too reality.  But everything they promise supports my life in some way.  Either directly, or through friends and family.  The PC's no longer represent that in my life.  The NDP's will support the ever-so important areas of Education and Healthcare by increasing corporate taxes (for not-small business).  I use to be against that, but the marginal increase is not enough to push business out of Alberta - not even close.  If you believe that you are delusional."

Two suggestions for fixing the .css of the subreddit though: - Fix the ""license plate"" header so that there are two links, one to bring you back to the front page of Reddit and another for r/Alberta.  See /r/Canada for an example, where the maple leaf leads back to the front page and the word Canada leads back to the subreddit - remove the coat of arms from the background of the comments section, since it makes it hard to read the comments    I'm not a .css wizard so I don't know where to start, but if we could fix these issues that would be awesome!"

You will just be lumped in with those who are apathetic and don't care. The politicians will sell this as a sign of ""they must think everything is ok"". You should attend a polling station and decline your ballot. This is the way to show your contempt of the current system. Being quiet at home does not affect change."
alberta,34xymy,TheKrs1,-1,Tue May 5 15:15:43 2015 UTC,"Neither does [edit: marking declining] a ballot.   [edit: marking declining] a ballot or abstaining entirely does show discontent. I don't think sub 50% turnout is healthy for the system.  At any rate, clearly it takes a lot more than that to change anything. This is simply not taking a step in the wrong direction."
alberta,34xymy,TheKrs1,1 point,Tue May 5 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"I did not suggest you mark a ballot. Declining a ballot is attending a polling station and declining to put any mark on it. If you do anything to a ballot other than vote for a single candidate properly your ballot is destroyed.   Declining has you counted as discontent with the system, it has your numbers counted. Sub 50% turnout (although I don't think that will happen this time) will NOT AFFECT CHANGE."

What has more impact:   60% of the voters stayed home this election 20% of the voters made the effort to attend a polling station but declined their ballot   I, if I had to bet, would say that people would stand up and notice that 20%. Those are people that easily could have marked a candidate on the ballot. That shows you are angry. The other side? 60% of people were too lazy or didn't care enough to vote. That's how it will be sold. That's how it's ALWAYS been sold."

alberta,34sauc,toddgak,-5,Mon May 4 19:57:08 2015 UTC,I do fear them. Their platform includes a 50% increase in the minimum wage by 2018. Because all boats rise with the tide this means all wages will rise 50%. this cannot be allowed to happen !
alberta,34sauc,Mikerton,9,Mon May 4 12:12:17 2015 UTC,While i do also disagree with a min wage increase by that much... your premise of all wages increasing by 50% is flawed.
alberta,34sauc,Himser,-2,Mon May 4 12:18:49 2015 UTC,Rough number minimum wage now is $10. They plan to increase to $15. Pretty sure that's 50%.

alberta,34sauc,swiftb3,2,Mon May 4 15:44:27 2015 UTC,But companies don't base their salary/wages on X dollars above minimum wage. The only people that will be affected will be those at minimum wage or close to it.

alberta,34sauc,amnes1ac,3,Tue May 5 10:36:53 2015 UTC,"Minimum wage increases have never caused economic collapses in the past. In fact, research and history shows the opposite. People having more money to spend is a good thing and actually improves the economy. A minimum wage increase is long overdue.  Edit: And the idea that this would cause all wages to increase by 50% is way off base. This simply doesn't happen, and it's never happened after minimum wage increases in the past. It's not like people making 50K a year are suddenly going to start making 75K, it just doesn't work like that."

We may get a few more taxes in a little while, but that's going to happen if the PCs stay in as well, but I don't see that affecting production too much. Overall we all know that what drives oil and gas is the world price. If that goes back up everything will go back up along with it. Maybe a change to the NDP will bring some necessary fiscal help to diversify our economy, allowing us to get off the roller-coaster of oil.  But for this year? Nothing's going to change. Any jobs lost will be lost regardless of government."
alberta,34utkv,no_malis,3,Mon May 4 20:34:19 2015 UTC,allowing us to get off the roller-coaster of oil.   Such a good way of putting it.
alberta,34utkv,sir_ramen,3,Tue May 5 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"So well put.  As an Albertan who has about as little to do with O&G as it's possible to have, I'd love to see some new industry crop up so we can reduce the depth of the dips a little.  If one thing about the world economy changing has the potential to end your entire province, that is obviously a bad thing in the long term. Especially if we know that there will eventually come a day where we either can no longer get that thing, or nobody will want that thing.  We have got to get some other cash cows going before we no longer have the chance to do that."
alberta,34utkv,electricsandstorm,1 point,Tue May 5 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"Although everyone likes to trumpet doom and gloom about this, I suspect the only change you'd see is, eventually, the environmental laws being transitioned to actual enforceable laws vice ""polite suggestions"".   As noted, it's not like the oil is going anywhere. The industry is still worth a shit ton of money and the infrastructure is already there. It's completely facetious to imply that the O&G industry would just up and leave. There's money to be made, they'll stay and make it.   There's an argument to be made that maybe industry should pay for the privilege of working in a first world nation that isn't continually wracked by terrorists and internal strife.   Just saying..."
alberta,34utkv,CadPatMatt,1 point,Tue May 5 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm worried about is companies punishing the province for not electing their cronies by moving their business elsewhere or shutting down operations.  Similar things have happened in other countries when they have elected left wing governments.  I highly doubt it will be as extreme as what happens in some other countries, simply because Notley is not an extremist.  Even if Notley's hypothetical government does nothing different than the PCs, there are business people who will choose to use their power to hurt the economy to make the NDP look bad, simply because of an ideological disagreement with the government.  I forsee her getting a lot of blame for stuff like this, despite it being an act of sabotage by business leaders angry that their PC donations have gone to waste."
alberta,34utkv,rydare,2,Tue May 5 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be especially considering that they still love money and the cost of moving in a first world country is far more than moving in second or third world environments.

Oh wait, the CCP is only worth $160 billion; only enough to buy the top 3 oil companies in Canada assuming we could completely drain the CPP.    That sounds awfully similar to the NEP/Petro Canada...  And look out that turned out.  You sound like an NDP politician, 'let's spend hundreds of billions of dollars that we don't actually have, and for what?  So we can say that we have a nationalized oil industry and make $20 billion a year compared to the 100's of billions(probably trillion's) that we put in!'

And no I don't believe we should pay extra for this. That's why the Wildrose has guaranteed operation times on their platform. They want to start out with 5 operations to probably see how it goes, and then potentially expand from there. This way medicare can expand and flex with the need, rather than just keep throwing money at a problem with money and making a bigger problem. Medicare was a good start, but it needs some fine tuning. A healthy population is a happy and productive population."
alberta,34q6xc,tenkadaiichi,6,Mon May 4 01:42:48 2015 UTC,"""Outsource"" is just another way of introducing the profit motive into health care. This is the biggest problem in the US model. They spend more per capita than anywhere else, yet underserve a significant part of their population. Too many health care dollars go to insurance companies bottom line.  The real solution is health promotion, keeping people healthy in the first place."

alberta,34q6xc,redditration,-3,Mon May 4 04:37:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. They always make big promises. But in order to actually survive and stay in power. They cannot actually follow through. They are simply trying to garner as many votes as possible. Just as they did in Nova Scotia. But they won't be able to deliver. Just as they do in every other government they form. Unless they tax the fuck out of everyone. Which is what's happening in Manitoba.
alberta,34q6xc,j1ggy,3,Mon May 4 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about other provinces, but every election (despite always keeping the same party thus far) we have had cabinet shuffles, new ministers, and departments/ministries split and joined to accomodate the new amount of Ministers that we have in the government. I have been working in the same place for several elections and have gone through four or five name changes, and we have had departments split off to other ministries/crown corporations, or brought back in, or absorbed parts of other ministries only to be done with them after the next election.  If NDP comes in, it's all going to be the same old shuffle. From the perspective of the rank and file, at least. As you say, the high-level executives may be affected a bit more."
alberta,34q6xc,oilpumper,1 point,Mon May 4 09:22:06 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear. I did think that there might be a bigger change if the government changed parties, especially since it had been 44 years since the last one."
alberta,34q6xc,drays,2,Mon May 4 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"Not everyone at the senior levels is a political appointee and many public servants will rejoice in the opportunity.  For too long public servants have been vilified, mostly by the WRP, but also by the PCs, and a new government will be seen as an opportunity to shine. In many departments, the ability to accomplish anything has been choked off by lack of funding and the sure knowledge that creative solutions will not make it up the chain to the ADMs desk by managers afraid to stick their necks out. If Rachel Notley is smart (and she is) she will make very few changes in the bureaucracy at first, and give those bright lights a chance to shine."
alberta,34q6xc,cchrisgc,2,Mon May 4 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I highly doubt there will be any changes beyond the very top dozen or so deputy ministers. The professional civil service will be fine although there will be an adjustment on their part. For decades the government has been the same and the civil service's job is to anticipate the government's wants. But if there is a change, they'll need to adjust. I expect there will be a freedom of ideas and a fresh approach."

alberta,34q6xc,redditration,4,Mon May 4 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Profitable corporations will pay slightly more (since the corporate tax only applies to profits, not gross revenue) and high earners (who can afford it, thus the title high earner) will also pay a little more and still be considerably more wealthy than the vast majority of people in the province. Finally, with a minimum wage increase, a large percentage of Albertans will be better off than before with slightly more money to spend (which is also good for the economy since people will, you know, buy stuff with that). You do realize that minimum wage increases in the past have never devastated our economy, right?"
alberta,34q6xc,j1ggy,-1,Sun May 3 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"See its lack of basic economics that  makes people ignorant. Companies that have to raise min wage will also have to raise prices to compensate or cut staff to compensate. Or else less profit and less tax gained. Now companies that aren't going to like losing money will do the same for corporate  taxes. Now they can also just pack up and move their company  because the rest of Canada may have higher  taxes but also lower min wage.  Or  like the oil  companies have done is just not be profitable. They can sit tight  make a few million  doing bare min and wait for us to vote another election. We make them billions they aren't going to settle for giving more away, they all have other investments and money in the bank. They can and will sit and wait. There goes thousands of job's potentially. Now investors not only are going to have to come in pay a higher  min wage but  higher taxes, not really something  that seems appealing to new investors  regardless if we are still lowest for taxes we have the highest  min wage.   Now if you add  on the simple fact ndp isn't for big corporations  they are about unions that will keep even more investors away. We have an economy  that's already down. We need investors not unions Healthcare workers and teachers  (we do need them don't get me wrong, but they are not economy  producing). Hopefully  that much you.can understand"
alberta,34q6xc,Dabookitty,3,Sun May 3 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly hyperbolic. A minimum wage increase will not turn billion dollar companies into million dollar companies.  And, actually having strong healthcare services and high quality education is essential to a strong economy. As is having a workforce that can afford to live and consume. Also, what is with the union point, it's not like the NDP go around creating unions in non-unionized workplaces. See this is why you get accused of fear mongering. You make huge exaggerations then extrapolate apocalyptic scenarios from them.  And like I said, you do realize that a minimum wage increase has never devastated our economy before, right?"

alberta,34q6xc,badcnr,-10,Mon May 4 04:17:21 2015 UTC,Actually I have done my own research  and I was actually considering voting for ndp.

alberta,34q6xc,badcnr,-8,Mon May 4 04:37:27 2015 UTC,Unfortunately true. It actually does suck. I like what ndp has to say. They actually align with what I would want. But after my research I would rather have a job in the economy we have now then no job in  an ndp economy
alberta,34q6xc,GoodGoyimGreg,13,Mon May 4 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Notley's platform is actually very similar to Lougheed's, it's not like they are proposing anything remotely radical. It's sensible and middle of the road. That's why they've gained such popularity in the province recently. I know that years of Conservative propaganda have resulted in this kind of default notion that the NDP is equal to economic suicide in the mind of many Canadian voters. But history does not bear that out, and is especially inaccurate in light of the proposed Alberta NDP platform."
alberta,34q6xc,Himser,-4,Mon May 4 18:47:21 2015 UTC,"Actually I base ndp's off of real people who have lived under their government.  Not some ad or pc propaganda.  Platforms always look good it's what they actually  do that matter. The fact ndp provincial ideals  are the same as federal and if they go against the can be kicked out is troubling.  But ignoring all that it goes down to if corporations actually cared about the lower and middle class ndp actually might be something  to consider but they don't.  I know all to we'll companies will come together to screw the workers. I live in a city where all of the companies I could work for have a collective agreement that they don't wanna pay over time and if you wanna work extra hours that's fine but straight  time. If you wanna go to labour union no problem you won't find a job in your field around this  city.   So given that corporations  aren't going to take the more tax and min wage lightly. They will either move or find other ways to gain what they lose. It makes sense cause  no corporation gets some where by handing away money.    So what does ndp do after that? Well history shows higher taxes on the people maybe even pst and probably higher taxes  on  corporations . So now possibly fewer jobs  and companies higher taxes. But better  education  and Healthcare until more companies and people leave then they need to cut from somewhere.   Ndp has done this several  times and people keep think maybe the changed. There is a reason pcs have gotten as far as they have in alberta. They have kept us stable,  with lots of job's, and good wages. Even though education and Healthcare isn't the greatest we have a good economy  when oils good. We have diversified just not enough to be good after oil  is down. I don't like pcs or even worst is wild rose, but both of those will keep our economy  welcoming for investors. Something ndp lack entirely."

There is so much to see and do around Banff that I don't think it would be worth it to venture north to Jasper or west into BC.   As for things to do I would definitely check out Lake Louise, it is probably the most amazing place I've ever been. You can take it easy and walk around the lake, or if you get adventurous climb higher up to the tea house.   About 1.5 hours north of Lake Louise is Athabasca glacier and the Columbia ice fields, another amazing site.  Even within the town of Banff is a lot to see and do, its unlikely you will get bored within a week.   Edit: I should also mention Johnston Canyon. There was a post in this subreddit yesterday that reminded me of it. Definitely check it out. Link to the post."

This will give you easy access to four national parks and let you see both the AB and BC sides of the Rockies. Or drop one of the destinations if you feel this is rushed (probably Jasper, but I'd still drive to the Columbia Icefields). Invermere gets you a tiny bit off the beaten path and more into a local/cottager area, which might be interesting for you as it's a bit different than the other destinations, and the hot springs at Radium are better than Banff. Total driving times between any of these spots is about half a day, with tons and tons to see all along the way.

Stop for dinner between Hinton and Jasper at the Overlander mountain lodge. As for Jasper, go to some nice restaurants (Fiddle River, Raven, Tekarra Lodge, Patricia Street Deli). Go to the Parks Canada info office and they will have all of the information on hiking/sightseeing with staff to help you make decisions on what to do.

I think we can both agree that the PC dictatorship isn't working anymore and we will both vote accordingly."

Graphs show that large corporations in Alberta have been getting a lion's share of profit for years, and their profits are going up while the working class wages have been stagnant.  Further, Alberta doesn't profit in any way from those corporations having more money.  They're all foreign.  We profit from our tradesmen being paid well, and the fact that they spend that money into the economy here.  If our tradesmen's wages and numbers go up, so does our economy.  Also, given the number of folks from out east working here - so do the economies there."

There are several explanations for why the housing prices (and thus also the debts) are so high in Norway:   You can deduce 27% of your interest-expenses of your tax, i.e. the government is sponsoring your debt! A strong tradition of owning your own house instead of renting it. A population which, by and large, has moved from the country-side to the cities (this has gone parallel with the increase in general education). The prices are not increasing everywhere, but in the ""metropolitan"" areas, and there the price-increase is backed by an actual lack of apartments.  A general belief that prices will always increase, making people willing to take up way to high loans (since it is a ""good way to make the money grow"")."

alberta,34p8b8,Konami_Kode_,-4,Sun May 3 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"No.  Norway's wealth fund works by siphoning pretty much all direct revenue from oil projects, and their social programs are supported by extremely high levels of taxation.  Why won't that work here?  First of all, we can't siphon that kind of revenue off. They have higher margins than we do from the start, and the highest earner, NG, has been in the dumps for years.  Second, taxation is considered a 'HERP DERP CONSERVATIVES!"" issue, but it's not that simple. Alberta has to maintain a competetive tax regime, both in terms of personal as well as corporate, in order to remain competitive against our largest competitor: the United States. The risk of the flight of both capital and educated individuals to greener (i.e. lower taxed) jurisidictions is simply not a risk that Norway needs to face nearly as much. Not only are most of their neighbors at nearly the same taxation level, but language and cultural barriers are much more significant if one wants to find truly favourable tax conditions. For example, it's much easier for a doctor to move from Alberta to Los Angeles or Orlando than it is for a Doctor to move from Oslo to Switzerland. Pretending this isn't a huge issue, even without taking into account the political resistance by our own citizens to higher taxes, is putting your head in the sand."

It's easier for a Norwegian professional to get a job in the United States than it is for them to get a job in France, or Switzerland, given the language barriers. And this is a big component of the problem: no European country, Norway especially (given they are not an EU member) has to deal with the brain drain a competing favourable tax and cultural neighbor offers the way Canada does with the United States. Alberta in particular has to compete with the Dakotas for resource capital, and with the entirety of the United States for labour, a market ten times our size with much higher pay for many in-demand occupations and lower taxes. Look at Florida or Texas; they have no income tax at all!  Now, this isn't an argument that Alberta should slash taxes or not even raise them, but there is simply no way we can afford to run the sort of tax regime that Norway does. Capital flight will be immense, and anyone who thinks that brain drain isn't a factor wasn't here during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It took us until 2010 before the shortage of nurses and doctors started to finally be resolved.  We are seeing this play out now vis a vis Ontario.

Those commodity prices are set elsewhere. Royalties have a small impact, but really, if the Saudis cut production Alberta's economy would boom. If they maintain or increase production ... it won't really matter how much you cut taxes or increase taxes. Or fiddle with the royalty rate."
alberta,34lqer,Orangemapleleaf,-4,Sun May 3 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"Oil is already picking up steam. These new taxes are unnecessary, and it's pretty weak of all these parties trying to scare us into agreeing to them by using the doom and gloom routine, well knowing they are going to be giving themselves hefty raises right away that will be covered up with the incoming oil revenue. That's why Wildrose's ""not raising taxes"" statement makes sense. We don't want to be chained to debt and high taxes during the good times like Ontario is, with overinflated energy bills and economy crippling tax rates."
alberta,34lqer,ircanadian,1 point,Sun May 3 03:00:34 2015 UTC,"Wages in this province normally inflate with the amount of business that we can convince to come here. More businesses = higher demand for employees. Higher minimum wages don't encourage people to start businesses here. In fact it makes it harder as the startup costs are even more stressing on the new businesses. This prohibitive approach to an economy can cause an exodus. We need to keep taxes low, and our spending efficient, in order to not only compete with Canada for business, but also the world."
alberta,34lqer,ircanadian,3,Sat May 2 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"This comments smells a lot like trickle-down.  By the same token, can you not also assert that businesses will rather set up where the population has more spending power?

alberta,34lqer,Mikerton,3,Sat May 2 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"Because you're delusional if you think raising the minimum wage will cause any such price hikes. Raising the minimum wage will give more spending power to ""pimply nosed 14 year old kids"" as well as all the seniors, people with disabilities, minorities, and many other demographics that make up a good chunk of minimum wage workers. More spending power means more business so they don't have to raise prices.  Can you even show a source that a raise in minimum wage has ever had significant impact on the price of commodities in the past?"
alberta,34lqer,Skandranonsg,-2,Sun May 3 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"I could call you delusional, but that would be petty. Sure, go to Australia, a pint of beer costs over $12.A happy meal is $15. But that's ok. Minimum wage is $16.80.  Do the math, same difference but know what, taxes are a percentage. That's right, higher numbers are higher taxes, higher Union fees, less $ in your  pocket."
alberta,34lqer,Mikerton,4,Sun May 3 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"Why are you even mentioning unions? This has nothing to do with them. Also, Australia is a terrible model for Canada when it comes to prices due to many more factors other than minimum wage.  Again, show me the data. When has a minimum wage hike resulted in a sharp increase in commodity price in the past? Link to a scholarly article our a reputable news source."

You need to show a before/after effect of raising minimum wage, which is what we're discussing right now.  Also, you began with the assertion that reading the minimum wage with cause the price of hamburgers to go up. You still have yet to show evidence for that assertion. You can't make a positive claim and expect to be taken seriously when you get called out and try to shift the burden of proof."

alberta,34lqer,electricsandstorm,-3,Sun May 3 16:46:14 2015 UTC,Where are they getting their money from. They start off going after corporate taxes but let's be realistic wealthy people don't get wealthy by handing out more money Wether to the government or anyone. So when corporations push back and move and lay people off and raise prices to keep their status quo who gets taxed next? The people.  And budget cuts on everything they promised us. They go in and ruin economies Wether it's bc ndp sask ndp or alberta ndp they all work the same idea. And they have ruined several provinces. I don't  see how stimulating the economy by scarring away investors. We don't have the highest  corporate tax  but raising both tax and min wage is a double whammy that  lower class and middle class will feel. We will be expected to do more with less people and higher taxes.  If the ndp had a solid economic  plan I would be for them. But really they aren't for the people they are for the unions.
alberta,34lqer,badcnr,3,Sun May 3 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously suggesting corporations are going to wage some sort of ""tax war"" when the only bargaining chip they have is jobs and there are hundreds of other companies who can provide the same jobs. AND we as a province hold the keys to their only method of revenue generation?  That will never happen, considering that they can't move the ground to another province, they have already invested heavily in Alberta, and that even so we are still a remarkably cheap place to do business."
alberta,34lqer,electricsandstorm,0,Sun May 3 17:32:57 2015 UTC,Suggesting they did it when royalties went up.coporations didn't get high up by handing out money.  Raising min wage and taxes not to mention the companies that have already spoken about how they will just screw  the lower and middle  class. Do you think corporations  have no power other than jobs that after ndp gets in they won't find another  place with yes higher taxes but not much higher taxes and lower min wage? Or just cut jobs and make a few people make due? Corporations already had to make due when the boom was around and not enough workers  so now why hire more?

No, wait.... actually their economy picked up, far more than nearby areas. Turns out when you give lower class people money, they turn around and spend it on good and services. And that's exactly what ""economic growth"" is, money moving through more hands. Turns out trickle-down economics is bullshit, but trickle-up economics work. I'm very excited to move to a more living wage for everyone. If you think raising minimum wage will destroy the economy, you're taking your beliefs from untested theories found in 80's era text books and not looking at the evidence.  The rich and their corporate theories think that a large, healthy, stable middle class is something to be exploited and shrunk. What they don't realize is how absurd this becomes when you replace middle-class with customer base. Exploiting the customer base so it shrinks is hardly good business. What part of more people with money to spend, instead of relying on government assistance, appears so disastrous to you?"

That's when we really started pushing key stone, because we were counting on that refinery, since we need to refine the bitumen. Instead of fighting to keep jobs and plants here.

We'd still have the lowest cooperate tax rate in Canada, No PST, a large work force ready to go and most importantly the resources are here.  Why would companies close up shop here just to move operation somewhere else?  It makes no sense and if that really was too happen I'm sure other companies would find a way to make it work.

alberta,34lqer,RynCola,2,Sun May 3 16:15:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, saying it's a 20% increase alone is just as misleading because there's a loss of information. It's like saying ""eating apple pie twice a day will double your risk of throat cancer!"" -- it's meaningless unless you understand that the risk of throat cancer is 0.001%, in effect, the doubling represents no realistic increase in risk.

I'm not saying it may not still be good for the province as it will generate more revenue and allow for more job creation in other sectors, but I don't think seeing it as 2% is as accurate when talking about increases in tax spending."

alberta,34lqer,Ashlir,2,Mon May 4 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"Nobody said that this will cause bankruptcy (OK some crazy people do but we can both acknowledge they're crazy), the increased taxes will decrease overall profit and will lead to at least some decrease in spending due to having less capital, this decrease in spending will most likely mean less expansion, less new wells drilled, and therefore less jobs. That being said, how many fewer jobs and whether or not it's worth it in order to balance the budget or spend the funding elsewhere is up for discussion."
alberta,34lqer,badcnr,1 point,Mon May 4 04:14:22 2015 UTC,"Well said.  Personally, even if it causes corporations to hire less I cant see the long term benefit when it is reasonably well understood that in the next 50-100 years our resource extraction industry will have to downsize in a big way.   We can finance the short term expansion at the cost of public infrastructure, but when the global market for oil shrinks (which is inevitable sooner or later). Lifetime Albertans will be stuck holding the cheque for corporations that actually now have a reason to move.   I'm just not comfortable putting all of our eggs 1 basket when we know the basket is short for this world. When that basket's only loyalty is to money, and 100 years on we will have nothing for it.   It might cost a few jobs in the short term, but the NDP address that with their job creation tax credit. And in the long term it lets us diversify an uncomfortably homogenous portfolio.  If we think 2 months, O&G need to save money somewhere, but they have lots of places to save money. If we think 20 years, we set ourselves up to avoid a crash unlike anything we know when the oil market dries up."
alberta,34lqer,Ashlir,1 point,Sat May 2 18:57:05 2015 UTC,how do you know if a corporation is tax less they will spend it to expand? They could just simply bank the profit or pay it out to shareholders.

The corporate tax plus min wage increase will cause company's to move, that's not a what if  statement that's it will happen. Other company's will sacrifice  the people at the bottom to maintain their profit and share of the pie. Do you think the people on the top got where they did by taking pay cuts?  Ndp's seem great, but their economic strategy  doesn't make sense with their idea of creating jobs and gaining  investments for cleaner energy sources.  It's actually a shame cause for the most part I like the ideals  of ndp but in practice they just haven't been effective. If they get in as a person of construction I am afraid they ideals  will leave me jobless with company's decision  to not expand and companies that will go with out instead of fixing up. I AGREE  pcs have spent way to long in power but in the long run of things with all the ups and downs we have stayed a major power house not only in Canada but the world.

I think good teachers should be treated like rock stars where schools compete to have the best teachers and offer far better packages. Instead of the current one size fits all system. I think any medical service the government provides a private company should also be able to compete with the public system. This would reduce the burden on the public system. This would also allow the private system to innovate which the public system could then copy for itself. Most of the developed world has public and competing private systems at the very least.

alberta,34lqer,Ashlir,0,Sun May 3 00:01:36 2015 UTC,A 20% increase in taxes isn't a small amount.
alberta,34lqer,wutsgudhomz,3,Sun May 3 01:32:22 2015 UTC,Corporate taxes are increasing 20%. Would still be the lowest corporate tax around.
alberta,34lqer,Ashlir,-2,Sun May 3 02:14:32 2015 UTC,Irrelevant. It's a 20% increase in taxes.
alberta,34lqer,Brett686,2,Sun May 3 02:22:27 2015 UTC,"It is completely relevant. If they are still lower than other provinces and those provinces haven't seen catastrophe, we won't either. 12% isn't horrendous."
alberta,34lqer,cjsedwards,-1,Sun May 3 02:44:46 2015 UTC,So our government should collude to tax as highly as our neighbors who's economies suck far worse than ours?
alberta,34lqer,Popcom,1 point,Sun May 3 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"You're an idiot. The entire point is to attract corporations. If we increase our corporate taxes and if it is still the lowest in the country then we are still more competitive than any other province and we are still the place to be for corporations in the country.   If we are all seeing a tax increase, the corporations should pay their fair share, they haven't paid adequate taxes for a long time.   So I call BS on your fear mongering here."
alberta,34lqer,mpobers,-1,Sat May 2 23:51:20 2015 UTC,Yeah we are going to attract corporations by raising taxes by 20%. That's brilliant. I think you might be mistaken as to who the idiot is here.

alberta,34lqer,ircanadian,1 point,Sun May 3 16:29:41 2015 UTC,I guess it's all relative. The political landscape is all tilted to the right so anything approaching the center seems hard left.
alberta,34lqer,leafyleafygreens,3,Sun May 3 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"Although they're left of center, the spectrum for parties here isn't that wide. The NDP are more of a people before business party but they're not out to change the fundamental make up of the country. If they started nationalizing everything and preventing private options in every aspect of life, we could consider that 'hard left'.   In this case, it's more a question of how to encourage the economy. Excesses in either supply or demand foster growth. Conservatives think stimulating supply (by supporting big business) should lead to lower prices and result in more spending. Progressives think that bolstering demand (giving consumers more spending power) results in more economic activity.   To a certain extent, both arguments are correct, but businesses tend to privatize their cost savings as profits (and the rich get richer) since the market was already able to pay their previous asking prices. On the other hand, regular consumers are more likely to spend any excess money they have, driving the economy. This is illustrated by Canadian's poor overall savings rate and the amount of borrowing they do."
alberta,34lqer,ircanadian,1 point,Mon May 4 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"I consider myself fairly progressive but I don't agree with your assessment of demand driven economy. Simply put, consumption takes out of the economy while production puts into it. This is why consumption taxes aren't generally more accepted by economists over income taxes."
alberta,34lqer,ircanadian,3,Mon May 4 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"A certain amount of non value added consumption is inevitable. Everyone needs to eat and toilet paper isn't reusable. These are definitely a drain on the economy. This is not discretionary spending however and doesn't represent something were we can choose to make drastic changes to. On the other hand, the increased liquidity that consumers have with fewer demands on their capital means that they can spend it more efficiently, resulting in less overall drain on the economy.   A good analogy would be buying a house. Someone with no liquidity needs to rent all their lives. When they retire, they have no accumulated wealth. Conversely someone who can get a mortgage owns their home and have the associated equity at the end of their working life.  This is especially important for the poorer segments for society since their lack of liquidity keeps them in the poverty trap. These poor represent a greater burden on health care, policing and, other social services while they effectively contribute nothing to the tax base.   If more people end up paying their taxes for fewer social services, we'll definitely be a richer province in the end.  Terry Pratchet sums this up nicely."

Something else that was certainly true in the last election, is that a number of Liberal, NDP, Green, etc. supporters voted for the PCs in the end because it was better than a WR victory.  I like to think that in this election, there won't be a huge reactionary anti-NDP vote (because neither Notley nor her party are viewed as extremists, unlike the WR three years ago). Also, in the last election there was still a sense that MAYBE the PCs could get themselves together under their new leader if they got a majority. I felt a lot of ""one more chance, guys"" sentiment at the time.  Well they've had their chance and made things worse - I suspect that they won't be given another chance by many Albertans.  On Monday, we might FINALLY see the PCs left behind; and the only party that seems capable of governing is the NDP, so more power to Rachel and her candidates!  edit: Getting my Notleys mixed up!"

They need giant signs saying, ""We care more about lower taxes and government kickback than people.""

I really wish there was a way to make these men more accountable for their words in the future, as it will most likely fade into obscurity as the election passes.

It may not change the final outcome of a particular election, but every single vote for the NDP increases their credibility for the next election and earns them more votes. Because of FPTP, does it matter as much as it ought to? No, it certainly does not, and I'd like to see proportional representation as much as anyone would, believe me. But not mattering as much as it should does not mean it does not matter at all. Every vote matters, and FPTP or not you absolutely should vote. Don't let the entrenched parties convince you that your vote is meaningless or wasted. That's exactly how they want you to feel, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don't vote, and it will guarantee that your vote continues to not matter.

alberta,34iypx,cache22x,5,Fri May 1 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"Debt is a very complicated topic, and is generally considered a valuable tool in the world of government and economics. If you'd like to learn more, and I do encourage you, you should read this paper on the subject:   The appropriate use of government debt depends on how debt affects the economy. As we have seen in the theoretical debate over Ricardian equivalence, debt could potentially have many different effects. As a result, the literature on optimal debt policy is broad in scope. Here we focus on the three effects that are most often viewed as important: the use of debt policy to reduce the magnitude of economic fluctuations, the use of debt policy to increase national saving, and the use of debt policy to reduce tax distortions by smoothing taxes over time.   It's a bit of a read, but very interesting, and I figured if you are going to vote based on a single policy, you should know that subject inside out!"

Saskatchewan has a great deal of natural resources, and have had those resources just as long as Alberta has had theirs.  Why is it only now that Saskatchewan is surging to be a Canadian economic powerhouse?  (Hint: The people of Saskatchewan removed the NDP leadership holding that province back)."
alberta,34noar,TnTBass,11,Sat May 2 21:32:01 2015 UTC,Serious question: where else in Canada can companies find oil?
alberta,34noar,comic_serif,-4,Sat May 2 22:41:26 2015 UTC,Just about any other province. Just not in as great abundance as out here in AB.  Edit: Really people? Am i wrong?
alberta,34noar,Brett686,1 point,Sat May 2 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"Nope you are completely correct, it's just that people don't realize that oil is pretty common, but cost effective oil fields are much rarer.  Sure there is oil in other provinces, but alberta, ask, and nefoundland have the most profitable fields."
alberta,34noar,Stephenherpes,6,Sun May 3 16:21:49 2015 UTC,I think it has something more to do with the fact that extracting oil from Saskatchewan and Alberta is expensive and when the price of oil hit $1.50/liter or $70/barrel it became cost effective to extract that oil. Under $70/ barrel or $60 the costs outweigh the benefits.
alberta,34noar,yolo_swagovic2,2,Sat May 2 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"For extraction from existing fields, which involves very few jobs. Exploration and new projects don't get profitable until much higher."
alberta,34noar,Stephenherpes,-3,Sun May 3 09:37:20 2015 UTC,"You're right.  Now the NDP will come in, raise taxes on business that are already struggling to survive.

alberta,34noar,TnTBass,5,Sun May 3 16:23:00 2015 UTC,yes theyll say lets go build up all that already existing infrastructure in Alberta that costs billions on billions in Saskatchewan where the proven oil reserves are nowhere near what they are in Alberta because the NDP might raise taxes. Yes that is definitely what they will do.
alberta,34noar,yolo_swagovic2,-1,Sun May 3 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"Infrastructure costs far less than you think, and SK has a great deal more oil than you realize."

alberta,34noar,TnTBass,3,Sun May 3 09:08:18 2015 UTC,What the NDP did in saskatchewan was create the groundwork for the current boom in that province. The saskatchewan party didn't come into power until 3 years after the start of their boom
alberta,34noar,drays,-4,Sun May 3 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"So they had 16 years to lead that province into a boom, but couldn't manage to do so until the last 3 years when they had a minority government and kept having their disastrous policies overturned by the opposition?"

alberta,34noar,drays,-4,Sun May 3 01:59:35 2015 UTC,"So if the Sask Party are so bad (as you say ""incompetent wing nut tits""), you're basically blaming their impressive social policy record, one which dwarfs any accomplishments the NDP had, as well as their fiscal policy which has led the province to record growth, all on a ""fluke"" and ultimately due to the NDP government that came before?  All this despite how in the 16 years of NDP government, Saskatchewan (a province with more natural resources than Alberta) managed to severely trail behind Alberta in economic growth.  That's some pretty impressive cognitive dissonance.  Out of curiosity, assuming you are Albertan, were you born and raised in Alberta?"
alberta,34noar,TnTBass,3,Sun May 3 02:03:23 2015 UTC,"You want to tell me what makes their social policy 'impressive'?  You want to tell me what about their 'fiscal policy' has created record growth? Because I sure don't see anything. And besides 'growth' doesn't matter if the ordinary Saskatchewanian is no better off. And service cuts and user fee increases by the Wall wing nuts have ensured that despite higher employment, the average citizen has less spending power than ever.  Mind you, despite their incompetence, they haven't trailed behind alberta at all. Because the alberta PCs are even worse.

Having more of your hard earned money in your pocket makes everyone better off.  I suppose one could argue that this is all just a strange co-incidence, however given this kind of growth was always available to Saskatchewan and never occurred until the change in government, I would dismiss that claim.    And I've lived in Alberta since I was six with a year or two in other countries, here and there.   I've lived in Alberta since I was a young adult, having moved here from Saskatchewan because my prospects for employment were few and far between (this was when the NDP were in power).  I've lived under an NDP regime, and I don't want my daughter and any other future children to have to move out of province for opportunities.  I have first hand experience knowing what the NDP can do to a province given the chance, and I have every right to be worried the same will happen in Alberta.  In closing, I do want to thank you for this debate.  Despite our obviously different views on the situation, I am glad we could have this discussion."

Are they absolutely sure that the NDP in AB won't do the same to AB that they did to SK/ON/BC in the past?  Remember, the NDP are one single party Federally and in all provinces.    I fear the people of Alberta, due to their hate/distrust of the PC party are throwing the baby out with the bath water here, as the other political parties of AB have an uncharismatic leader (Liberals), aren't being looked at seriously (Alberta Party) or have committed political suicide as of late (Wild Rose)."
alberta,34noar,aardvarkious,10,Sun May 3 23:39:30 2015 UTC,"A change in government isn't going to make our natural resources disappear. This is a resource rich province, which is why people moved here for work. It's not like they were fleeing from Soviet satellite states."
alberta,34noar,TnTBass,-7,Sun May 3 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"Before the CCF party came to power in Saskatchewan, Regina had the second most head offices in the country behind Toronto.  Once the CCF rose to power, head offices moved to Alberta (namely, Calgary).  Saskatchewan has a lot of oil, and a great deal of other natural resources waiting to be tapped that were never tapped under the NDP leadership.  Saskatchewan has a lower Small Business tax rate than Alberta currently, and will be on par with Alberta if the NDP gain power and do what they promise.    You say companies won't move, but why wouldn't they?  If you can get more natural resources and pay lower taxes elsewhere, why would they stay?  Is this just blind hope that they won't move - because I've given you an example of how a change in politics can cause that exact situation, and all you've provided is rhetoric that ""it won't happen."""
alberta,34noar,aardvarkious,-8,Sun May 3 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, they do have a long way to go - this just re-enforces my point about the long standing damages that an NDP government can do to a province."
alberta,34noar,TnTBass,8,Sat May 2 21:15:29 2015 UTC,What policies in particular are the Alberta NDPs proposing that you think will be disastrous?
alberta,34noar,autowikibot,-2,Sat May 2 21:18:05 2015 UTC,"Its the NDP's general practice of being anti business.  They discourage growth of business through increased taxation (which is in their current budget) while at the same time promoting unions and more public sector ran businesses and public sector employees.  The money has to come from somewhere, and if business cannot thrive in Alberta like they've been able to do for over 40 years, that will have a significant impact to the tax base the NDP rely on to pay for those increased public sector increases.    That is, unless the NDP want to rely on using all of the oil & gas revenue to pay for these things, which is great until the next time oil & gas takes a hit.  Is the PC party the answer to the current government problems? Probably not, but neither is the NDP."
alberta,34noar,TnTBass,2,Sat May 2 21:27:18 2015 UTC,Once again: what specific policies of the provincial NDP are you concerned about?
alberta,34noar,TnTBass,-2,Sat May 2 21:32:20 2015 UTC,"Higher corporate taxes.  I have employment with an existing company that has already laid off people due to the economic slump.  Burdening that company with more taxes could very well mean my job.  Oh, don't worry says Notley, she doubts that tax increase will have any effect.  Should I be mad at my employer if that happens? Sure, but they wouldn't shoulder the blame alone.  Under the NDP plan, public sector worker's jobs are more important than private sector.  Royalty reviews - during a time when oil and gas companies are letting people go.  Sounds like a fantastic move.  She will perform the royalty review the minute she can.  Overall budget she has planed.  Lots of spending, but no mention where this money will come from.  I am guessing it will come from my pocket in the form of taxes, or it will be sucked out of the oil and gas revenues this province makes, which will cause AB to take on large debt the next time oil and gas drops.  Unfortunately, their plan is to balance the budget in 3 years, hoping against hope there will actually be revenue at that time to do so.  Also, all the other points I've made."

alberta,34lll0,thedloan,2,Sat May 2 06:24:11 2015 UTC,"The editorial makes a lot of leaps of faith. While arguing that support of critical social services is dependent on a 'robust"" economy, it fails to acknowledge that Prentice is ideologically opposed to supporting those services, regardless of the economy's strength.  The editorial also comes close to endorsing corporate tax increases, hinting that Prentice should reconsider his position. He has been adamant that he will not.  On two major points then, the editorial is endorsing the Prentice they want, not the Prentice they have.  Rachel Notley, on the other hand, will support social services via corporate tax increases.

It is an economic powerhouse, even with the downturn. It still creates the most jobs in the country, and it still keeps Canada's economy healthy. Victimizing ourselves with excess taxation is not the values that built this economy. This problem with spending has got to stop before we open up our wallets and dump the last remaining contents. Wildrose is the only answer at the moment, and I am pretty disgusted that the once proud PC party has stooped to a pro taxation level. Excess taxation is a symptom of an underlying issue. We still rake in a lions share of revenue, and our province has one of the easiest budgets to balance.

alberta,34hm6f,Anthropax,1 point,Fri May 1 15:01:23 2015 UTC,You and u/blackborealis both make agreeable and similar points. I fear a socialist government discourages the people that can afford these people a hand up and if it implements a program it just becomes an expensive overcombobulated program that only benefits the large masses of government personnel that run it.  Private mentoring is much more effective. A little personal effort is required.
alberta,34hm6f,Mikerton,2,Fri May 1 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"A little personal effort is required   The problem is we're talking about the disabled, the uneducated, the working single-parents, and the homeless youths.

alberta,34hm6f,aardvarkious,0,Fri May 1 15:49:20 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. The fact that we still have a flat provincial income tax is ridiculous. The fact that the PCs wanted to remedy that with a 'temporary' progressive tax is even more so.

Look , their money gets spent or invested for the betterment of everyone too.   There are still government services to pay for.    Take their money out of the equation and no ones going no where.

Too make more of course so they can pay more taxes to fund programs. Do they not deserve some return for these efforts ? Yes, the über rich suck, but a little research will show the majority of those give lots back to benefit causes.   I'm not going to change your mind here but increasing taxes discourages investors and Alberta does not need to do that. We take in lots of revenue through the sales of our resources that would pay for ample programs if so much wasn't wasted by greedy politicos stuffing their pockets. They are the problem not hard working entrepreneurs who will go elsewhere if our environment isn't favourable."
alberta,34hm6f,Mikerton,4,Sun May 3 04:44:54 2015 UTC,Poor people pay no tax.   Poor people pay no income tax. Poor people pay plenty in flat-rate government service user fees that are taxes in all but name.

alberta,34hm6f,aardvarkious,2,Fri May 1 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Poor people pay no tax.    If you make over $18,000 you pay income tax. Someone who makes $25,000 is going to feel a 2% increase in all their taxes a lot more than someone who makes $250,000 will feel the income falling into the top bracket being taxed 2% more.   The wealthy pay by far the largest percentage of government revenue all the while risking capital,investing their own rather than tax payers monies.   They can make money because they have roads, electricity, communications, and other government infrastrucutre to use. They have a work force that was educated and kept alive by the government. They have courts to enforce contracts and police to protect their property. And I could go on and on. It isn't like the government is taking from them without giving back.   Yes, the über rich suck, but a little research will show the majority of those give lots back to benefit causes.   According to statscan the average yearly personal charitable donations for someone making over $120,000 is $744.   I'm not going to change your mind here but increasing taxes discourages investors and Alberta does not need to do that.   Maybe you have an argument here against raising the corporate rate or resource royalties. But how is charging progressive income tax going to discourage investment?"

alberta,34hm6f,aardvarkious,1 point,Fri May 1 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"But the government needs ""general revenue."" It needs to tax people. This isn't a conversation about if they should tax or even how much they should tax, but how they should determine who pays what portion.   Why is money left in a rich person's pockets more productive than money left in a poor man's pockets? I would argue the poor man's money is more productive: most of it is going to stuff the government will pay for anyways of the can't, and it will all get spent locally."

It simply requires more money to maintain the system, as opposed to rolling back cuts. Education is what makes the immigrant a full Albertan. This isnt waste per se but a recognition that we need more schooling to handle more students.  You want me to advocate for less taxes?  fine - bring in less people"
alberta,34li3g,44years,0,Sat May 2 06:36:03 2015 UTC,"Well if Saskatchewan was an example, NDP contributed to a population decrease. Unfortunately, less people, means less people to work jobs.

As someone who has been convicted of an impaired, I support increasing penalties for people who are foolish enough to make the mistake. I also support increasing education in the school systems to help teach youth about understanding alcohol metabolism and the effects of drinking on judgement of one's ability. The course you must do after an impaired is excellent though."

Things like say you just had a beer a couple minutes before hopping in the car on the way home so that they had to wait a few minutes to breathalize you.  And then when you ding you could fight it in court because you hadn't metabolized the alcohol yet.  Seriously.  That's what our company's driver safety guy told us.  Not 'hey guys, don't drink and drive you morons,' but, 'it's fine to drink and drive, but tell the police some goofy story that probably won't work.'  I forget what driving school this was at.

Old farmers back then used to do it all the time and still think they can.  for whatever reason its been chosen to basically not go after them until theyre all died of old age/wrapped around poles in their trucks, but increase penalties such that the newer generations dont get this idea in their heads.

alberta,34eh5k,44years,7,Thu Apr 30 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"I think the basis of his argument is that while smoking is bad for you, if you want to smoke you should still be allowed to. While these government programs don't ban smoking, they do discourage it. His argument, which I do agree with, ia that if you wish to take the risk of smoking, thqt is your choice to make, not the government's, and as long as you are properly informed of the dangers you should be allowed to make whatever choice you want. Current programs go past just pointing out the dangers of smoking, and actively discourage it.   Hopefully I made the argument clear, but if there's anything I mqy have been unclear about let me know and hopefully I can clear it up. More right wing points of view are often discouraged in the big subreddits, and I hope I can ckesr up any misconceptions. People like TexasNorth also don't help with their rudeness."
alberta,34eh5k,Ruleof2,4,Thu Apr 30 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"sure, and thanks for the clarification.  the problem is what you pointed out - its discouraged.   As opposed to being made illegal, the user still has the choice to smoke which sort of kills his argument.  All the by-laws from no smoking resturaunts to not smoking out doors is a quasi step between people like me who dont smoke and dont want to breathe that stuff in, and discouraging smokers from smoking by way of its inconvienence.  If it bothers him that others dont want someone smoking around them, then that would seem to be a personal issue."
alberta,34eh5k,44years,3,Thu Apr 30 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"The problem is not that you can't smoke around other people, as there are serious health concerns with second hand smoke,  although I think there are better solutions than what we have right now. Cigarettes are hidden in stores, and the boxes looks especially scary. While I don't want huge advertising campaigns saying how great smoking is, I think a more plain, neutral packaging would be more fair, not discouraging or encouraging smoking. Its the fact that the government is spending money telling me not to smoke that is a problem. Not that I smoke or like smokers, but its the idea that the government is telling me what I should or should not do to myself."
alberta,34eh5k,Ruleof2,3,Thu Apr 30 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"the logic from the gov't perspective (according to a nurse I know) is that since we know smoking is bad for your health, then if less people smoked the less strain there would be on healthcare.  I can agree with that....so long as they dont actually make cigarettes illegal I dont mind them saying anything in adverts about its health effects, so long as its accurate."
alberta,34eh5k,44years,3,Thu Apr 30 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Well for the strain on the healthcare system, I always thought that the tax on tabbaco was more than enough to compensate for any additional use of the healthcare system. Plus, smoking might cause you to die younger, decreasing your need for healthcare as you won't be dealing with the problems that other people do at old age."

alberta,34eh5k,Dabookitty,6,Thu Apr 30 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"I would suggest there are a few issues that relate to how we do (and how we should) deal with drunk driving:   Viewing/Understanding alcoholism as a chronic disease or disability. That lessens the degree to which personal responsibility can be ascribed. It also makes it a medical issue, requiring treatment, rather than purely a justice issue, demanding punishment. It's difficult to know exactly what one's BAC is, and people tend to under-estimate their level of impairment. It's not (except for learners / novices in some provinces) a binary issue: it depends on one's BAC, not simply on whether or not they've had a drink. It's difficult to know exactly how one stands. Am I above 0.05% or 0.08%, etc...? This is different than other crimes, e.g. ""Have I stolen something?""  Many parts of the country do not have adequate alternative means of transportation (additionally, you could be charged simply by waiting in your car for the inebriation to pass!) For many people, driving is essential to their livelihood. We would be worse-off as a society if we made all of these people (and their dependents) unemployed.   Ultimately, I think that having good, effective smartphone apps, able to reasonably estimate a person's BAC based on when and how much they've eaten and drank, along with their sex, mass, and body type. Unfortunately, liability issues can arise for developers: were Health Canada to provide smartphone apps, this might be more reasonable."
alberta,34eh5k,SaidTheCanadian,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this idea. Drunk drivers are most often not bad people,  they are drunk and therefore cannot be trusted to make the decision to drive or not. It is a matter of life and death."
alberta,34eh5k,WeWillFreezeHell,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:09:21 2015 UTC,Most people are sober and know their travel options before they have a drink. I wouldn't go to the bar if I didn't have another way home.
alberta,34eh5k,RetartedGenius,1 point,Fri May 1 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"It also makes it a medical issue, requiring treatment   Unfortunately, rehab is 100% voluntary.  If you do not want to be there, you can check yourself out.  This goes for court ordered rehab as well.  Court says ""go to rehab,"" you say ok, walk in the doors, and walk right back out.  You followed the courts ruling, but the court can not keep you there.  This is the problem with recognizing alcoholism as a disease REQUIRING treatement.  We can not enforce that.    Ultimately, I think that having good, effective smartphone apps, able to reasonably estimate a person's BAC based on when and how much they've eaten and drank, along with their sex, mass, and body type.   ""The app said I was not impaired, so I am not, so I am going to drive.""  Yeah, that is going to spell bad news, even if it is a Health Canada app...could you see the lawsuits directed at them for damages?"
alberta,34eh5k,tehReno,5,Fri May 1 03:54:52 2015 UTC,"Because everyone's guilty of it at times? Even the lawmakers. It's what I feel is true. My friend said that in place in Europe, I have never verified this however, that a conviction means you lose your license forever. Truthfully if like to see that, we could even soften it to a the strike rule to sell it easier and it's be a huge deterrent imo"
alberta,34eh5k,Cord87,9,Thu Apr 30 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say the better reason is that we know punishment is neither a deterrence not produces behavior change. And then and even better reason is that punishment must match the damage caused to society. 3 drinks and a check stop, with no damage to society, should not equate years in prison. That's what additional charges like destruction of property, causing bodily harm, etc exist. If you drive drunk and hurt someone, you're going away. Trying to catch the .08 BAC people and sending them to jail does nothing but create expenses and ruin potentially productive citizens."
alberta,34eh5k,ldmccoll,3,Thu Apr 30 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"I cannot believe people say things like this. Aside from the people who are actually drinking and driving, I'd say that people like you contribute to the number of drinking and driving accidents the most. Sounds harsh? Let me explain:  1) Deterrence.   You claim that punishment does not act as a deterrence? You have offered no source. Here is what wikipedia has to say on the matter:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_%28legal%29#Effectiveness   Some research has shown that increasing the severity of a punishment does not have much effect on crime, while increasing the certainty of punishment does have a deterrent effect.[17] ""Clearly, enhancing the severity of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe they will be apprehended for their actions."". Similarly, enhancing the certainty of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe that the sanctions to be imposed will be severe.   Severe punishment for drinking and driving is incredibly unlikely. The reason for this is that severe punishment only happens when people get into severe accidents. At any given moment, when someone is drinking and driving, they don't expect or intend to get into an accident, and therefore they don't factor the punishment into their decision. Do you think that most people who drink and drive and then kill people expected such a thing to happen? Probably not, and so there's no reason to suggest that they'd factor in the punishment to their decision.  To properly deter people from drinking and driving, you must increase the certainty of severe punishment enough that people actually factor it into their decision to drink and drive. If there's a likely chance of jail time every time you drink and drive, people are not going to do it. You need very strict enforcement for this to even have a chance to occur.  2) Blame  You think that someone who has consumed alcohol and failed to cause damages has caused no damage to society, while someone who is involved in an accident needs to go to jail. Not true. Drinking and driving is unlikely to lead to a collision; however it does lead to an increased probability. Someone who drinks and drives and causes a collision has exercised no more criminal judgement or intent than someone who drinks equivalently, drives, and makes it home safe. The accident is a chance occurrence. Placing the blame on the accident itself benefits nobody.  3) Normalization of drinking and driving  Removing the blame from people who have made the decision to drink and drive and placing it on the people who have been involved in accidents while drinking and driving takes the stigma off the cause of the accidents and places it on the chance results (the accident itself). This allows people to drink and drive (or associate with those who do) while still becoming outraged at the chance injuries and deaths caused by the very same behavior.  You say:   Trying to catch the .08 BAC people and sending them to jail does nothing but create expenses and ruin potentially productive citizens.   This is basically the culmination of everything I have wrong with your type of argument. You are arguing that drinking and driving itself is not bad enough to severely punish. You feel that it is too hard on society to punish adequately. If drinking and driving is so common that putting people away will harm it too much, then we have to re-evaluate our society, and not simply put away the few unlucky people as a sacrifice so that we can feel better about our collective behavior.  4) Prevention vs Retribution  Long sentences for people who drink and drive and cause deaths or injuries are a great way to get a sense of justice, but a poor way to actually prevent people from being injured and dying. It actually requires people to be injured and die before you can even do anything. Catching people in the process of drinking and driving however, catches them before they ruin lives. Once the accident has occurred, putting the person in jail doesn't resolve anything (other than keeping them off the road). It doesn't bring anyone back, or heal brain damage, or grow back lost limbs.  In summary, you feign being tough on drinking and driving while refusing to direct effort to stem the actual cause of the accidents. You punish people involved in accidents to feel better while protecting the majority of risk causing behavior. You present a hypocritical double standard defending people who drink and drive while demonizing people who are involved in accidents. You view the act of drinking and driving itself as harmless. It's policies like this which ensure that people will continue to drink and drive in large numbers and injure people."

I certainly appreciate the thought and effort you've placed into your well articulated reply (re-reading my typos is embarrassing and a reminder of why I don't normally post). Thanks for sharing your opinions, no reason to attack me for mine."
alberta,34eh5k,ldmccoll,0,Thu Apr 30 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think that a strict no drinking or you're gonna get your license taken away would leave no gray area when it comes to the question of ""have I had too much tonight?"" If you could lose the right to drive forever then no one in their right mind wouldn't call the taxi every time. Chasing around people to see if they are .08 or not is just lawmakers pandering to the peoples and their own biases. Just because people want something doesn't make it right, especially when the other end could mean death"
alberta,34eh5k,Cord87,8,Thu Apr 30 19:29:33 2015 UTC,Because everyone's guilty of it at times?   That is not true at all. Stop drinking and driving.
alberta,34eh5k,sarge21,5,Thu Apr 30 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"I apologise, it was an over generalization, I shouldn't lump everyone in. To that effect don't accuse me either.   What I meant and should have said was - enough of the voters and lawmakers are guilty of it and nobody wants to have their quality of life impinged because of a glass of wine which hey perceive as harmless but as you mention in your other post, the moderate attitude creates a bad climate for the severity of the issue, keeps it cloudy."
alberta,34eh5k,Cord87,0,Thu Apr 30 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"If you are caught drinking and driving it should be an attempted manslaughter/murder charge, if they did end up killing some one it should be Manslaugter or Vehicular homicide.  It's long over due to take the gloves off and start treating drunk driver more harshly for their personal choices.  Unless some one is forcing the drinks down their throats they know what they are doing...and what the results could be.    I for one can not except the ""I was to drunk to know what I was doing"" excuse."
alberta,34eh5k,Dabookitty,9,Thu Apr 30 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"The burden of proof is so low to justify demanding a breathalyzer already. As someone who was just raked through the coals for 6 weeks on a ""refusal to provide sample of breath"" charge that has now been completely dropped, I say NO. My license was destroyed on the spot and my car impounded. In case you are wondering why I refused to provide the sample of breath, it is because my medical condition PREVENTED me from even completing the test (which I tried 9 times to complete by the way).  The moment you start penalizing regular innocent citizens on your pursuit of justice is when I'm going to go up against you in the fullest.  Driving drunk is already illegal. There are already punishments for it. If convinced there is a 15 or so step program that takes months for you to get your license back. They really do make you jump through 1000 hoops.  No victim no crime  & if you start charging people for an act they did not yet commit thats just draconian."
alberta,34eh5k,john-b,11,Thu Apr 30 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, for as I much as think Drunk driving should be penalized harshly, I cannot reconcile the fact that in Alberta you are considered guilty effective immediately, and then you must prove your innocence. In every other type of criminal charge, you are presumed INNOCENT, until proven guilty. The waythe law is laid out it is actually an affront to real justice.  Edit: typo"
alberta,34eh5k,keepcalmdude,3,Thu Apr 30 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"I used to be staunchly against the on-the-spot suspension, but then after seeing a dozen or so over .08 cases, I realized that everyone who gets off did blow over .08, but gets off on Charter arguments.  The thing that I'm. not okay with is that the pre-trial suspension doesn't count for anything. If you're held in custody before your trial for any other charge, you are generally given credit at a 1.5 : 1 ratio. But with an over .08? No, the government is going to strong-arm you into taking a guilty plea by telling you that you can get a blowbox by three months or you can wait six months for a trial."
alberta,34eh5k,TheMisterFlux,5,Thu Apr 30 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"But that's the issue, all criminal charge should be processed and treated equally, yet somehow for this offense it's ok to punish before conviction?

I don't know what condition you have, but it sounds like it could have been a bad judgement call by that particular officer at that time.     But people like you are very very rare.  And not those I am referring to.  If you blow over the legal limit, you should be charged with attempted manslaughter.   Driving drunk is already illegal. There are already punishments for it   Very true...but the punishments are a joke.  Months to get licenses back...oh boo hoo.  Driving drunk and risking killing people...that is a small price to pay.   There is no excuse to be driving drunk in today's society(Not like there ever was)."

alberta,34eh5k,keepcalmdude,-1,Thu Apr 30 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"Sweet...I have asthma too.  Well aware how common it is and the issues that can come from it.  There are ways of getting the medical exemption you know.    But again we are not talking about people who refuse the breathalyzer for whatever reason.  Be it medical, religious or they are just stupid.    We are talking about people who are clearly intoxicated...they already blew over(Or blood results came back and prove they are over the legal limit).    There is nothing about presuming guilt.  Guilt is for the courts.  I am talking about changing the charge to something more serious.  You drive drunk...attempted manslaughter.  Kill some one while driving drunk...Manslaught.  Defend yourself against that charge.  There is no excuse for driving impaired...NONE at all.  Get some serious charges laid against these people...send a message to society that we will not tolerate people risking all our lives just becasue they think they drive after a few drinks."
alberta,34eh5k,Dabookitty,3,Thu Apr 30 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"But that's the problem , they already presume you guilty no matter what. License cut, car impounded, life fucked over BEFORE you ever see a judge. I have no issue upping the penalties, I think thats a great Idea, same with more enforcement, but it's entirely backasswards to make someone prove their innocence. The onus should be on the courts to prove guilt."
alberta,34eh5k,keepcalmdude,-2,Thu Apr 30 20:44:21 2015 UTC,Then that is how it is for all charges.  A charge is not a conviction and therefore it is not guilt.  License suspened...should not happen that way.  But as far as impounding the car...perfectly okay with that.  It would qualify as holding evidence as part of an investigation into the crime.  Life fucked?  That is not the police or the justice systems doing...that is all on the driver.  If they did not want to fuck over thier own lives...they should not have driven after drinking.
alberta,34eh5k,Dabookitty,3,Thu Apr 30 21:15:08 2015 UTC,What would suggest then? Jail time? 30 lashes in a public square? Leg amputation? Minimum 30 years jail sentence ?
alberta,34eh5k,john-b,-1,Thu Apr 30 20:00:45 2015 UTC,"What would suggest then?   Going through the Justice system on the attempted manslaughter charge(I would say murder but that takes intent and I sincerly believe the drunk drivers do not intend to kill anyone).  Kill some one while driving drink....then that is Vehicular manslaughter.  And should be punished as such.  Again you had a very rare case, which was proven in your favour.  Yes it sucks that you went through it and I am sure there are steps that can be taken to prevent something like that happening in the future.    The Current system we have does not work.  No more slaps on the wrists.  No more letting people get 19 DUI convictions.  So yes Jail time is called for.  At least there they can get the help and rehabilitation they need."

Unfortunately your facts are incorrect.  As per this government of Canada website on equalization payments, Saskatchewan became a ""have"" province in 2008-2009.  The Saskatchewan party first became the government in 2007.  The population of Saskatchwan has actually started really growing under the Sask Party leadership.  Under the NDP, the province was a ""have not"" province and the population did not grow.  Those, dear /u/cisco45 are the facts.    Given Saskatchewan is hungry for new businesses and is growing while still maintaining a balanced budget in 2015, the NDP plan for Alberta might as well be the best thing for Saskatchewan yet."

In 04-05 $652, 05-06 $89, 06-07 $13 (a rounding error, really, lol) 07-08 $226. The total transfer in those four years is less than a billion and yet the NDP turned over two billion to the SaskParty in 2007. So Saskatchewan became a ""have"" province in 2004 (with some small transitional transfers the next few years)."
alberta,34cyqx,cisco45,-1,Fri May 1 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"The NDP also lost their majority government in 1999, so its clear that while the NDP had a majority government the province was on a downhill slope.  When the Sask Party became a strong official opposition, the NDP were not allowed to keep implementing the same disastrous policies.  Once the Sask party became the majority government, the province started growing stronger and stronger every day.    The NDP of Alberta will do the same to Alberta that the NDP of Saskatchewan did to that province.  Its great to say ""We will grow the public sector and hire more public sector employees"" but the wages for those public sector employees gets paid by private sector workers taxes.  You can't erode the tax base of a province through over taxation, driving people away from the province and expect the money to keep flowing in."

Premier Lorne Calvert reformed the taxation system and continued to balance the books that helped SK become a have province and grow the economy. In fact when the SaskParty took over, there was about $2Billion for them to dramatically increase spending. This year's budget is a $1.5Billion deficit budget. (Although to be fair some of it is infrastructure spending.)"

That's because government spending during a downturn is the smart thing to do. It's basic economics, and one of the very few things that economists have empirical data to support and agree on. It lessens the effects of boom-and-bust cycles in the private sector on the economy as a whole.  The problem in Alberta is that under the PCs, the other side of the equation was never implemented: reducing government spending during boom times. Money that was used to keep taxes at rock-bottom levels should have gone into the Heritage fund, to enable the bust-time government spending that will be needed very soon."

I agree our current government needs to be replaced and perhaps Wildrose isn't ready for prime time. But a socialist government would be too Union friendly and unwieldy. I'd personally like to see a PC minority with a Wildrose ally to keep them honest with a NDP opposition to again keep the pressure on both to do the right things.

Raising, the corporate tax rate to 12% hardly constitutes greed. It is a modest increase that is actually in line with the rest of the country. This on it's own would not destroy the oil industry. The oil isn't going anywhere and neither are the oil companies. The oil sector has always threatened this, going all the way back to when Lougheed raised royalty rates. And it has always proved to be an empty threat. These companies need our oil reserves and raising corporate tax rates by 2% won't change that. And the NDP have already said that they will not review oil royalties while the price per barrel is low (which is actually something the PCs did under Stelmach). The idea that bitumen production will stop because of this tax increase is foolish and not based on reality."

As for students running the province.....well, maybe that is not such a bad thing.  Get rid of the good ol' boys club in Edmonton and replace it with young blood, new thoughts, new ideas.    My only concern would be the students not being able to split their time between Legislature and school.  Also, the Minister of Transportation, to use a cabinet position, does not mean that the MLA is doing all the work themselves, they have professionals in the industry working with them, and helping craft the policies.  All the Minister needs is good judgement, an open mind, and a willingness to learn.  If you want to take this to the alarmist extreme the Levant is worried about, then, in his perfect world, you would always have Doctors as the Minister of Health, Generals as the Minister of Defense, Judges as the Minister of Justice...industry professionals in their fields only being the Ministers.  This is not the way it works.   IMHO, having a student, or recent student, someone who is used to seeing new ways to approach an idea, having and open mind would be a perfect fit for a cabinet minister.  Someone who can absorb information from many different sources, verify them, poll ideas, and come up with a solid policy based on information from varied sources is EXACTLY what we need."

A willingness to learn rarely goes hand and hand with an individual who thinks they know what is best for individuals at large.  At least in my opinion   If you want to take this to the alarmist extreme the Levant is worried about, then, in his perfect world, you would always have Doctors as the Minister of Health, Generals as the Minister of Defense, Judges as the Minister of Justice...industry professionals in their fields only being the Ministers.   I think you make a great point, that this is not always the case. In fact I think there may be reason to believe that someone on the outside looking in, say for example a Business owner running a hospital over a neurosurgeon, may be far better at finding wasteful practices within the organization.   This is not the way it works. IMHO, having a student, or recent student, someone who is used to seeing new ways to approach an idea, having and open mind would be a perfect fit for a cabinet minister. Someone who can absorb information from many different sources, verify them, poll ideas, and come up with a solid policy based on information from varied sources is EXACTLY what we need.   I think you make a great point, particularly I would say on the technological literacy the younger generation have over the older, and how that in many cases can be used to streamline organizations with technology.  That being said, I am not sure if students have a monopoly on seeing new ways to approach an idea, particularly when it is students who are graded largely on their on their propensity to conform to a professor's view or a university text book. Entrepreneurs on the other hand I think may fit this role.  What do you think?"
alberta,34gmda,tehReno,3,Mon May 4 08:43:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, they do not have a monopoly on new ideas or thinking, I am just taking the criticisms that Levant uses in his video and relating directly back to them.  I feel as though injecting a larger group of younger people into the legislature to get seasoning, such as it were, could only be helpful in the long run.    We have 40 years of governance by one party.  No government that we get that is not PC will have any experience running a legislature.  Many that are not PC that get elected in, will have no experience as a MLA, let alone a cabinet minister.  Let us be honest, NO PARTY RUNNING EXCEPT PC IS TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED TO RUN A GOVERNMENT IN ALBERTA!  We have to be ready to accept this, and give a new government time to learn.  Time to come into their own.  I feel that youth is the way to go in this case, but you do need to have some seniority in there as well; even the older people in the NDP, Alberta and WEP are not going to have governance experience, just more experience at life.   Entrepreneurs on the other hand I think may fit this role.   For certain.  Farmers would be another way to go as well.  I feel as though they have a rather unique view on things.     Business owner running a hospital over a neurosurgeon, may be far better at finding wasteful practices within the organization.   I think having a business owner and a neurosurgon as part of the portfolio team for the Health ministry, to use that portfolio again would be a good idea, as both present valid, though possibly opposing views on the same subject.  The Minister can then take both view points, help figure out either the middle ground, or which is better for the common good, and take that to legislature to have it enacted.  Decisions by committee is how our government works."
alberta,34gmda,tehReno,2,Mon May 4 09:05:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply!   For certain. Farmers would be another way to go as well. I feel as though they have a rather unique view on things.    This sounds very intriguing. I am so far removed from farm life, that I am now curious at what they typically bring to the table.   I think having a business owner and a neurosurgon as part of the portfolio team for the Health ministry, to use that portfolio again would be a good idea, as both present valid, though possibly opposing views on the same subject. The Minister can then take both view points, help figure out either the middle ground, or which is better for the common good, and take that to legislature to have it enacted.   Yeah that is the better way to do it; you are right.  Have an excellent morning!"
alberta,34dbgq,Beejsterb,11,Thu Apr 30 05:54:51 2015 UTC,"NDP are proposing a job creation tax credit.  NDP are calling for a royalty rate review while the Liberals have not.    Liberals want to phase out school fees while NDP want to half them.  Liberals are calling for mandatory vaccinations for children (unless parents sign form opting out).    NDP are wanting to eliminate corporate and union donations to political parties.    NDP want to bring back the Summer Temporary Employment Program (Employment program for students and youth)    Both want to increase taxes on the rich but the tax increases proposed by both parties vary a little.    There's more, but that's off the top of my head.  Aside from the platform differences, there's the major difference of the Liberals being completely disorganized this campaign vs. the NDP.  The Liberals are not running even close to a full slate of candidates.  I don't know if that's a factor in your decision but it might be."
alberta,34dbgq,GoShogun,4,Thu Apr 30 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"They are very similar. A quick-and-easy tool to see some key differences is to answer the questions on the vote compass and once done, take a look at where each party stands on each question.  But the real difference between the two is strength. NDP has all the momentum currently. The Liberals were caught off-guard with this election and as a result only have something like 40 candidates running.   Do remember in first-past-the-post voting, strategic voting is necessary. Therefore if you are having trouble deciding between the Liberals and NDP, choose whichever candidate you think has a better chance of winning. Here is a list of all alberta ridings and their current projections (based on polling data up to April, 28)."

alberta,34d8eo,blueandgold92,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:59:44 2015 UTC,"I get where they're going with this, but I'd take some issue with some parts of this. They're really just trying to paint him as some fumbling politician, but   Following that crushing defeat, Prentice turned his attention to the federal party, becoming a vice-president. It is here that the man’ s inability to read which way the political winds are blowing is first revealed. In December 1990, with the federal PCs barely edging into double-digit public support and Preston Manning’s Reform Party coming on strong , Prentice  boldly predicted a comeback. ""The core of the party is strong,"" he told the Edmonton Journal, vowing ""a dramatic turnaround before the next election."" It got so bad for the Progressive Conservatives that in April 1991 the Alberta PCs voted overwhelmingly to divorce themselves from the federal wing, a move Prentice refused to acknowledge as a rebuke. That August, while announcing that he was seeking the position of PC national party treasurer, Prentice proclaimed his party, still led by the incredibly unpopular Brian Mulroney, were “the only truly national party that’s operating right across Canada”. Prentice was one of the few who could not see the very large writing on the wall   So what? You think an officer of the party isn't going to try to claim that the party is doing well or that a turnaround is on the horizon? The man is clearly a conservative but perhaps he didn't want to jump ship to the Reform? Thus, he would stay with the PC's and attempt to help it survive.   And so he didn't support Klein in his leadership race? Again, so what. Numerous people supported Dinning and Morton over Stelmach. Numerous people supported Mar over Redford. They all still went back to the PC government at the end of the day."

High on thoughts, low on details.  15% cut in infrastructure spending will mean the projects go up in price 10-20% once the boom is back on, plus delaying does nothing to stop the massive flood of people losing their jobs.  Mortgaging the future to save today.  Typical.  2.5% to health and education?  Sure...where?  What are you proposing to cut?    Two-tier health care...sure!  I'm actually all for it...BUT (and here's the big but)...we must, by law, also have a public system.  So what doctors get to be private, and which public?  What doctor is going to work in the public sector if they can make more money privately?  How do you intend to keep the public system going?  (Sidenote:  I actually have an idea on that one...you take the private system fee-for-service, but the doctors/nurses/etc all still make the same fee schedule as the public system - you channel the revenues from the private side into the public side, helping to fund the public system and reducing the tax burden of the public system, while still maintaining a quality public system).  Even socialist Liberal me doesn't necessarily disagree with your baby bonus/child care/etc arguments from a financial standpoint...but here's the next giant BUT...we'd be going against the trend of every other province in Canada...which would suddenly cause a dramatic shift that the people (families) that make up our working class are more advantaged to leaving Alberta to other provinces.  Without a solid workforce, your Alberta Advantage dies too...companies can't find people, and our economy tanks.  Yes, it helps with the Provincial budget, I don't disagree with you in the slightest, but the impact of that will be far-reaching in harming our overall economy.  I speak very often in my political debates of ""Competitiveness"" - yes, I believe the top can afford a point or so more tax, yes I think the corporate tax rate should go up a touch, yes I think we need to look at royalties once this bust is done with...BUT we still cannot give up the Alberta Advantage...we still need to have the lowest (or tied lowest) tax system, we still need to have the lowest (or tied lowest) royalty scheme, because we absolutely do NOT want to drive business out of the province either.    I won't deny in the slightest that the government bureaucracy needs to be examined, but you can't just propose massive slashing without damaging services that we as people, and corporations, rely upon.  Pure austerity budgeting does as much damage economically as pure tax and spend like drunken sailors.  We need to be balanced in solving our problems - we need to look at our expenses, but we need to look at revenues as well, and be smart about balancing the budget AND putting away for the next bust in the cycle so we're not running around like fools screaming ""The Sky Is Falling!"" next time.  I'll be blunt, the WR thinks that pur Austerity is the only way to go, the PC's are sucking corporate dick while screwing the people, I don't have a fucking idea what the Liberals stand for really, and the NDP is looking at the revenue side while really ignoring the costs side.  Nobody IMHO is right in this platform.  Bluntly, I'd LOVE to see a WR/NDP coalition, as I think the two of them working together could work wonders for this province, but the odds of that happening are effectively zero.  So for this particular cycle, I'm voting NDP in hopes that we see a more balanced approach."

That, that actually sounds really reasonable. I don't think I agree with it, but if we were to have a two-tier system, I think I could just manage to live with that.  The problem I have with TN's straight cuts to things like healthcare and education is that a lot of times the cuts come at the cost of front-line people (doctors, nurses, teachers) as opposed to actually fixing inneficiencies and creating a more cost-effective system.   Cuts just make people panic. These systems should have the confidence to objectively look at themselves, figure out what they can fix, and fix it."
alberta,34b5hh,Blackborealis,-8,Fri May 1 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"Mortgaging the future to save today. Typical.   You're going to fucking preach to me about ""mortgaging the future?""  LOL.  LOLOLOLOLOLolololoLOLOLOL.    Oh god, why do I even bother?  I don't know.  Since you actually put some thought into your post, I'm going to reply to you like this.  I could fix this economy and province in two incredibly simple steps, and here's how:  1.  Reform the tax system so that NOBODY has their tax deducted from their paychecks, and everyone instead has to write a personal cheque to the government once every 3 months.  People are fucking stupid sheep and don't realize exactly how much money they pay in tax.  Forcing them to write a cheque from their own savings account would help to ""educate"" them.    2.  Alberta will raise and lower tax rates based on how much spending we actually do.  For example, if Albertans decided that we want to overspend by 7 billion dollars this year (as we are), I am ALL FOR THAT.  No problem with that whatsoever.  BUT, we all get to pay for it.  $7,000,000,000 / 3,000,000 people = $23,333.00 (in addition to the tax that you have already paid.)  Guess what, kids?  You want all of your fancy bike lanes and public transit and healthcare?  NO PROBLEM.  Just cut a cheque for ~$23 grand per family member and we'll make it happen.    That's $23 grand PER FAMILY MEMBER, IN ADDITION TO the provincial tax that you have and will ALREADY pay.  They want stupid sheep people out there demanding ""more things"" from government.  They want people to be stupid and arrogant and comfortable.  They don't want these stupid, arrogant people to know that the province will OVERSPEND by $23 grand per person this year ALONE.  I would completely accept an Alberta that pays for it's debts IN FULL EVERY YEAR.  That's the type of province that I WANT TO LIVE IN.    Make these ""I know better than you"" Socialist fucks write a fucking cheque for more money than they make every year as a ""starving artist.""  Can't write a good cheque?  We'll confiscate everything you have, and we'll sell it at an auction.  We'll force you to file for bankruptcy year after year.  I would LOVE to start seeing some of these ""bike lane advocates"" start LITERALLY starving......but don't worry, we'll give you all the bike lanes you want!.  I'll pave the entire god damn province in fucking bike lanes and solar panels if that's what you want AND you can write the cheque.  Can't afford to feed your family?  Tough.  Actions have consequences, mother fuckers.  And when you die of starvation, I'll burden your children with the costs of your burial AND the amount of unpaid tax you have left outstanding at the end of your life.  And if they can't pay, we'll setup Soviet style work camps.  I'll enslave your entire god damn family, either until the end of time, or until you pull your head out of your ass and quit demanding that the government ""do more for you.""  Socialist-Progressive-Liberals think that they can just sit their on their fucking asses and make all of these demands.  That's great.  You can demand whatever the fuck you want as long as you can write the cheque.    You would see a fucking revolution in this province if either of these were implemented, which is EXACTLY why the cowardly PC's and Liberal idiots won't go for it.    ....And the only difference between ""my plan"" and ""your plan"" is that you want to take the cowardly way out and make your children pay for your poor decisions, whereas I want to make YOU pay for it and hold YOU responsible for your actions.  That's an idea that Liberals despise.  They despise being held accountable for anything.  ""Fuck the grandkids, daddy needs bike lane infrastructure NOW!""  I'm not the one ""mortgaging the future"" here, genius.  :/  Pay up, sucka."

Well you are right people are stupid.  You help support that.  It comes off peoples cheques because that makes it easier for the average person to budget and live within their means.  Money they never have, never gets spent.  While it is actually a good idea in theory, in practice it will not work.  To many people live paycheque to paycheque and would not be able to have enough to pay the taxman when the time came around.  A little off each cheque is far eaiser to budget for.  And your math is way off.  Your math of extra tax per person completely ignores Corporate taxes as if they did not exist.  Or that the wealthy do get taxed more then the poor.  Other ways to solve our problems would to:  Tax Reform:  Scrap the Flat Tax and move back to progressive tax brackets where the wealthy pay a higher rate over all.  Increase Corporate taxes and renegotiate a better deal for royalties.  Bring Back healthcare premiums to the levels they were at before.  (If I recall the numbers correctly that would bring in 2.2 Billion)  Sales Tax: Stop being afraid of Taxes and institute a Provincial Sales Tax.  Projections are for every 1% PST we would bring in $1 Billion in revenue.  A 5% sales tax would bring a huge amount of financial stability to the provinces expenses."

There is no province that spends more money per person than Alberta.    .....But we should just keep spending like crazy and raise taxes, right?  Please don't reply.

Same, you're ignoring all the spending that benefits business and corporate interests instead of people, yet nothing in your little rant to get the companies to pay their share of the ""overspending"" as well...again, typical.  Third, you forget that there IS such a thing as good debt, as long as it is properly managed.  Putting $50K in electronics on your credit card when you lost your job?  Fucking retarded.  Getting a reasonable mortgage to buy a house while you're working?  Not dumb.  Right now, in this economic climate with the jobs dying due to the oil sector, costs have dropped dramatically for infrastructure projects.  Tenders I'm doing right now have come in 10-15% lower than expected, because there are WAY more bidders on stuff.  Greasing the infrastructure wheel in a mortgage right now is actually smart spending, because with interest so low and costs so low right now, the financing costs are less than the savings to do it now...PLUS it keeps people employed by private businesses which keeps tax revenue flowing to the province from both individuals and corporations...PLUS we all know that oil & gas WILL recover, and if we are smart when that happens, we pay off these debts in a insanely short timeframe.  If you kill infrastructure spending now, you'll pay more than the financing costs in a couple years time for the same project before you even factor in inflation, and more people lose their jobs, and more companies close their doors in the meantime, which only furthers the recession in Alberta, further reducing governmental revenues.  And I LOVE how you run this into hippie bike lanes and other bullshit projects.  Do you have any idea that there is literally billions and billions of dollars in critical infrastructure dying in front of us right now as we debate?  Not bike lanes, not the bullshit of the Province buying the Oilers a new arena...REAL problems that need REAL dollars and not Austerity bullshit fearmongering.  I agree with you 100% in that these touchey-feeley-bullshit projects need to go, but it is fucking smart right now to put money - including debt - into critical infrastructure to ensure the long-term viability of the province for people AND businesses to enjoy.  And I notice you ignored a huge swath of my post just so you could attack literally one line.  Again, typical conservative fearmongering bullshit - take one comment, and spread fear about it without even understanding what is being considered.  You couldn't even pull the full quote, just three words...the full quote is ""Mortgaging the future to save today"" - and that's exactly what cutting infrastructure spending proposes.  You are pushing all of this required spending on our kids and grandkids to save a dollar today.  Shit, when you can borrow money for less than the fucking cost of inflation and putting it towards things that ensure that roads, transportation networks, and things the economy NEEDS to SURVIVE going forward.

I mean, for no other reason than the fact we are paying interest on our debt these points are all valid. Every year part of our taxes simply go to paying the interest, instead of being used for something useful. All because the PC can't keep a balanced budget.  Now I don't necessarily agree that we should get out of debt ASAP, but that definitely needs to be our objective. And some debt can be beneficial, if it's for an investment that can ""pay for itself"" (example: build a road and set up a toll). Of course with the current state of debt trying to pay it off in a year for instance would make the cure worse than the ailment, but a 5-year plan?

I don't need the social safety nets that exist, I make very good money and I don't mind paying my share for the people that do (I worked for what I have just as hard as you did so you can cram your 'free ride' bullshit straight up your ass by the way). What I do mind is when the government turns around tells me I'm not paying enough when the corporate tax rate sits at 10% and oil royalties have dropped from 35% to 15%.   Conservative governments don't work. It's time to change. Period."

alberta,34b5hh,JackOCat,4,Thu Apr 30 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"In reviewing the Wildrose platform, it seems to be high on promise, but severely light on detail, making it exceedingly difficult to evaluate the feasibility of their proposals:  The Wildrose claims they can balance the budget by 2017 without raising taxes or cutting frontline services. They do so by making some fairly big assumptions. For instance, they claim that “ending sole-source contracting” will save 10% of current expenditures on contractors. Without the detail to evaluate that claim, it seems optimistic to say the least. Another line-item they added to their cost-cutting list is “more leadership from the top.” Exactly how that is quantified or expected to deliver measurable savings is wholly unclear.  There isn’t a real plan in place for long-term savings in the Heritage Fund. They do claim that if they invest 50% of the budget surplus into the Heritage Fund, and allow the interest to compound, it will grow to more than $200 billion in 20 years. However, even assuming a 5% compounded return, this is incredibly high, to say nothing of the fact that this savings plan depends on the presence of budget surpluses. We need a savings plan that works for Albertans regardless of whether the operational ledger is in balance, surplus or deficit.   This is from those Bolsheviks over at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. They aren't exactly gung-ho on the NDP either, but at least the NDP has a viable plan. The WR wants to promise the world and count on magic oil fairies as a source of revenue. Whatever your political leanings, a good fiscal record requires a good fiscal plan, which the Wildrose simply doesn't have.  http://m.calgarychamber.com/insight/blog/2015-provincial-election-guide-party-platforms-alberta-business#.VUI36vnnZSB"

alberta,34b5hh,Mikerton,2,Thu Apr 30 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"The NDP ran balanced books in the 70s under Allan Blakeney, the PCs decimated our province in the 80s and many of their cabinet ministers and mlas went to jail. Gordon Dirks was part of that government as a cabinet minister but was defeated in 1986 - (all the charges were from the 1986 - 1991 term). In 1991 the NDP was elected, balanced the books, reformed the tax system and ran balanced budgets and Sask became a ""have"" province under Premier Calvert. Since the SaskParty took over, they's increased spending (including the $2billion the NDP left them) and this year is borrowing $1.5 billion."
alberta,34b5hh,cisco45,2,Thu Apr 30 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"Um, though I can agree the Romonov government was a disaster, the NDP's balances were buoyed with equalization payments and high corporate taxes stifling commerce. Brad Wall's Saskatchewan Party opened Saskatchewan for business turning into a have province. Also they must balance and are cutting some programs to achieve that what with the crash in revenue. Spending is up but population and business in general is through the roof. Sorry on mobile , no time for definitive proof but these are my mental knowledge, maybe not totally correct ?"

alberta,34ayxf,aardvarkious,-7,Thu Apr 30 03:30:39 2015 UTC,"Nothing... but what she has done should be a crime.   stealing a 5c candy is a ""crime"". But is that anywhere near as bad as an elected official completely betraying the trust of her constituency? If such behavior is tolerable, then is any politician truly accountable for their actions?  If there is no punishment in the law for such actions, then how is our political system a democracy? You can vote for someone, they can do anything... the response ""oh well, it's your own fault for voting for a liar""?"

alberta,34ayxf,xrendan,-1,Thu Apr 30 04:07:57 2015 UTC,But don't you think the voters vote for the party they want to represent their district and province more so than even the individual? Crossing to a party you didn't want representing you is a betrayal no matter how you try to spin it.
alberta,34ayxf,Mikerton,3,Thu Apr 30 11:53:15 2015 UTC,The problem I see with that train of thought is that politics aren't frozen in time : things change. If you do immediately after you are elected then sure you aren't representing your constituents wishes after after a year or two things can change. Now what Danielle Smith did probably wasn't in the best interest of her constituents but I still don't think that floor-crossings are inherently bad.
alberta,34ayxf,xrendan,0,Thu Apr 30 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"Can't agree with that. Yes things change , but that doesn't justify your representatives jumping to the party the majority of voters in that district voted AGAINST. ( not a yell, an emphasis). Fine, if the representative doesn't agree with what their party is doing, sit as an independent until the next election, than run where you feel. This would be the honourable way but..."
alberta,34ayxf,Mikerton,2,Thu Apr 30 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"In theory sitting as an independent would be ideal but frankly its not always the most realistic way to support your constituents. If you sit as an independent (at least in Alberta, not sure about federally) you are disadvantaged since you aren't part of a group with party status. If you do not have party status you do not get funding for research offices nor do you get much time in question period, thereby reducing your ability to collaborate and hold the government to account as well as represent your constituents."
alberta,34ayxf,xrendan,-1,Thu Apr 30 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"right, but this is example where the constituents were outraged. Also, the doublespeak of saying don't vote PC after the fact is... I don't know what to say. I laughed, but in a dying on the inside sort of way."
alberta,34ayxf,ag3ncy,2,Thu Apr 30 17:44:42 2015 UTC,That speech was actually when smith was leader of the wild Rose for the 2012 election. And yeah what she did was not (imo) in the best interest of their constituents
alberta,34ayxf,xrendan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:53:40 2015 UTC,It is very common in Canada that floor crossers get trounced in the next election. That is why you don't see it happen very often. It is also the reason that you rarely see the formal coalition of parties. The electorate tends to spank individuals as well as parties that make significant changes to their status without approval from the  ballot.

In fact, he’s been snowboarding since 1991 and owns three snowboards. “I was one of those first guys they wouldn’t allow on many slopes, because I won't raise your taxes.”  The best snow for snowboarding? “Usually Revelstoke, because there I can be free to not raise your taxes” Jean said. He kite boards, white-water kayaks, doesn't raise taxes and does outdoorsy things. A lot.  His mom, Frances Jean, published her first book recently, called More Than Oil.

I know in my riding they just recently changed the signs to the name of the candidate, before it just said ""Rachel Notely""  In a representational democracy, voting for a party seems counter intuitive to voting for the better person to represent your constituency. If you're voting for someone who is essentially just a name on a piece of paper, what value do you think they'll bring to legislature?

The WR candidate seems fiscally competent, but I feel a bit like the lunatics are running the asylum in that party. Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, the Alberta party has the strongest combination of competent candidate with hasn't-fucked-up-yet party/platform; unfortunately, a vote that direction really just splits the left/gets burned/adds to the PC lead.  So now I'm stuck trying to decide... Strategic vote or best candidate/party combo. If this were a ranked voting system instead of a first-past-the-post system, my decision would be 100x easier.

All opposition parties are because Prentice lied when he became PC leader in the summer of 2014 and said there would be no early election.  Personally,  I think the party and leader is more important than any one candidate. Backbenchers don't have huge roles and need to take time to learn how to be an MLA.

Health can't just wait sometimes, and we have to make sure everyone has that available.

When the government meddles in ways such as setting ceilings/floors (ie. raising minimum wage, taxes on profits) it affects the ability of the market to reach the fair market prices.   This is only true for certain types of goods though, with gas, if the price goes up 10% you're not going to stop buying gas.

PST, especially when the necessities of life are excluded from it, is one of the most progressive forms of taxation out there.  I'm open to a royalty review...we need to remain competitive, however if we're significantly below the royalties in other jurisdictions, we're leaving money on the table.  If we're lower than everywhere else, then yes, I support a rate hike, but not one that would put us above the next lowest...we have to remain competitive as well, not just tax into oblivion.    I support higher taxes for the top 10% of earners as the PCs have proposed.  And for the record, I'm one of the people that will be hit by that tax increase, and I still support it.  I support a similar tax increase for corporations, but much like my royalty statement, we cannot become uncompetitive either.  I also support having a careful examination of the civil service, and making sure the bureaucracy isn't there to be bureaucracy. We need to be lean, but we also need to provide effective services to the people, and that requires having a strong public service of good smart people that work hard for us.  And the last time oil royalties were pushed upward also coincided with the 2008 crash, which is what put the stop in the oilfield, not the royalties.

Then I looked it up and found stats like this   Of the 52 years the NDP has formed governments in Canada since 1980, they’ve run balanced budgets for exactly half of those years and deficits the other half. This is a better record than both the Conservatives (balanced budgets 37 per cent of years in government) and the Liberals (only 27 per cent).   ndp-govt-has-best-fiscal-record  Frankly, I'm astounded that this isn't commonly known, the chief stereotype of their detractors being that the NDP are terrible wardens of the economy.

The current NDP in Manitoba can't seem to save that economy, whether or not they're the cause of it. And Dexter in Nova Scotia wasn't popular enough to last more than a single term.   I'd attribute the majority of NDP success in the past 30 years to the Saskatchewan branch where it started, but they've been decidedly less idealogical and more pragamatic than elsewhere for much of the last while (Romanow at least).

alberta,348pzm,Laniius,14,Wed Apr 29 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"I suspect a lot of the opposition to government getting involved with oil is not contingent upon the fear of jobs being lost/not created but more so the opposition to socializing any industry.   Thirty years ago I would have been a fiscal conservative. Free trade, relatively lower taxes, and reduced barriers to investment largely increased our standard of living. The mistake, I think, was peeling back the safety net as far as we have. Regardless, supply side economics seemed to have worked for some time.   But this isn't thirty years ago. NAFTA isn't bringing the same goods it did before - sure our GDP is rising, but we don't score well on the gini coefficient. Supply side economics has been put into hyper drive, and the profits of firms are largely going to investors and shareholders, while middle and low income jobs are being outsourced or made obsolete via technological innovation.   It seems pragmatic, and dare I say in the self-interest of most citizens (self-interest is typically the operating basis for conservative thought, and I don't say so pejoratively. Conservative thought rests on the individual, in opposition to collectively held imperatives) to some extent socialize industries and augment the economic outcome; ensure the wealth is spread around. The same argument is made for joining unions, yet conservatives, interestingly enough, claim unions should be ashamed of themselves for using the leverage they have to get the best deal they can - an approach conservatives typically approve of in corporate endeavors.   In short, it is probably in the best interest of most Albertans, and especially young Albertans, to elect an NDP government. The abndp are pretty close to the center relative to their federal and provincial associates. Supply side economics are highly ideological, and I suspect many purveyors of disguise it as pragmatism.   There is something odd about those in power (with wealth) telling the poor they'll get fucked if the powerful contribute more. Who's interest is really being taken into account here?"

They have drifted from many of the fresh policy ideas that drew me to the party originally. They were an impressive opposition, but obviously the floor crossings put an end to that. The Anual General Meeting last year and the leadership review suggested a shift in the controlling membership away from the types of conservatives I like, to the banal variety of conservative that won't fix anything. So I didn't renew my membership. Brian Jean has failed to keep that my last shred of hope in that party alive.  While I'm not idealogically on board with everything that NDP pushes, there are a lot of issues where I think they'll get things right. Notley seems educated and reasonable and I think a left wing government will invigorate sectors of government that the PCs have let lapse. I'm willing to give them a shot.  I hate the argument of change (in government) just for the sake of change. So I'm not voting against the PCs just because they've been in control for decades. I'm voting them out because they are not improving Alberta anymore and seem out of ideas. That and the mismanagement, entitlement, and cronyism that the Wildrose so thoroughly berated them for in the last term."
alberta,348pzm,sseeeds,11,Wed Apr 29 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"I posted this comment a few days ago in /r/edmonton:   I support the NDP (both provincially and federally) because I believe in progressive economics.  For example, there seems to be this huge fear of running a deficit here in Alberta, but this has never really been explained to me. When the economy is struggling, it makes sense for the government to invest in things like infrastructure, even if it requires responsible levels of debt to do so. This capitalizes on historically low costs of borrowing, lower labour costs during a recession, and puts people to work.  Another example is responsible rates of taxation. There seems to be this conservative idea that the rich should be sheltered from taxes, because they stimulate jobs. I think actual experience is that this money that is left with the rich tends to be moved out of the province, buying luxury goods manufactured elsewhere, or homes in Palm Springs or whatever. An actual use of tax policy that creates jobs would be something like Quebec's daycare program, where taxes are required to subsidize care, but then more young women actually are able to work and the economy benefits.  It is kind of ironic, because I personally benefit financially from conservative financial policy in general, as my household does well in terms of income, so the Alberta flat tax is great for me, as is Harper's income-splitting ""tax cut"", etc. I just think my family and everyone would benefit in the long run by actual investment in our economy, rather than handouts to the top 5%.  Sorry, I know I don't really have any numbers, but I'm not an intensely political guy. For a numbers example, look at the US. Bush I and Bush II cut taxes and economy suffers. Clinton and Obama raise taxes and invest in infrastructure and healthcare, and the economy does great. Obviously over simplified, but that's the way I look at it."

There is a ""huge fear"" from Albertans for our province running a debt and deficit because it's not the correct path for us to be on, and it's the immoral thing for us to do.  Do you really not posses the basic level of common sense to see why debt and deficits are generally bad things?  Can you not see that with massive deficit spending that what you're essentially doing is handing your children a massive bill for them to pay off because you wanted some bike lanes and pedestrian bridges?  ""Hey, sorry about the bill kids, but daddy thought it would be a good idea to spend a bunch of money that he didn't have on stupid, idiotic, and frivolous things.  My bad.""  That's not going to fucking cut it.  You crow about ""responsible rates of taxation"", and yet FAIL to mention RESPONSIBLE LEVELS OF SPENDING at the same time.    It is irresponsible to spend more than you make.  But that's what Liberalism is all about - massive spending and deficits and sticking your grandkids with the fucking bill because ""you know what's best"" - not them.    Your brand of Progressive-Liberalism is LITERALLY the most immature, unnatural, irresponsible form of governance ever devised.    You make decisions based on how you ""feel"", or what your ""emotions"" tell you instead of FACT and LOGIC and COMMON SENSE.  It is COMMON FUCKING SENSE that government is not the solution to all of our problems.  IT should be common sense that not everyone in this province is as biased and left-wing Communist as you seem to be.  It is common sense that Alberta should not go the way of the failed Liberal states of Ontario and Quebec   You're not educated enough to understand the ""unintended consequences"" of what you seek.  You're not smart enough to see that NDP-type Liberalism has failed in every other province where it's been tried - instead you demand that we should double-down on Liberalism and try it here, because maybe we can finally get it to work for once in all of world history.    With your beliefs, your children will grow up in a Canada that is poorer and less free than it is now.    It is fucking shocking to me that you can't see that.  :/"
alberta,348pzm,CarlSpackler22,2,Thu Apr 30 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, I think you are projecting when you say things like,   ""yet so strong in their pig-headed political opinions - to literally know and understand SO LITTLE, and yet be SO SURE that their way is the only right way forward""   I think any fair reading of the conversation so far would find that you have clearly expressed more confidence in your political opinions that I have in mine, and that you, not I, are less willing to concede that the opposite point of view might have some merit.  Secondly, I would argue that there are both responsible and irresponsible types of debt and deficits, as well as responsible and irresponsible types of spending.  If you can't even agree with me on this point, then there is no point in continuing the conversation.  An individual, family, or small business, for example, can be totally responsible in taking on mortgage debt (at levels they can service), or even taking out non-mortgage debt in order to leverage towards investing.  A provincial government, similarly, can and should borrow when the return on investment is expected to be greater than the rate of borrowing.  There are tons of caveats here, but the point stands.  What frustrates me is that any disagreement with the current orthodoxy in Alberta results in these crazy rants where the sky will burn, society will crumble, and statements like:   freedom is currently dying a slow and painful death    and   your children will grow up in a Canada that is poorer and less free than it is now.   No, a desire for a progressive income tax scheme and a review of royalty rates doesn't make someone a biased, left-wing communist."

To wit:   He feels that because (not kidding here) I've never been rich, I dont know just how bad it is to have to pay that extra amount because were not just talking about an extra few hundred dollars He agrees with the idea that without a middle class, there is no democracy but then says that the middle class should be taxed more, since the poor already have nothing and the middle class is an easier target then makes the argument that if we ""punish the corporations with higher taxes"" then their stock price will go down, which will affect investors, which in his view are all middle class people, and so the NDP are shooting themselves in the foot by hurting the middle class this way.   Its sh*t like this.  I dont even have to argue in favor of NDP since just listening to him talk made me realize just how much of a mistake alberta made over the past 4 decades, and EVERY one of the employees who walked by were very obvious in their body language how they felt.

They also promised to reinvest in health, education, etc but I have no idea where they are going to raise the funds.  Clearly clueless IMO.   The Liberals and Alberta Parties are non-entities.    The PCs, well, they say that we had a deficit and rightly raised taxes.  We cannot and should never sued natural resource revenue to artifically keep taxes low.  That being said, they purposely left corporations out with the idea that to raise taxes to the same levels as those socialist haves as Texas or Alaska would create a melt down.  As you can see, I'm rather skeptical.  Yes, we all need to look in a mirror to see why we are where we are.  And by all, I mean ALL.  They don't have any news ideas  except to keep oil and gas happy.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I too come from a very poor family but because of the Heritage Fund and generous social services that were once offered in this province under Lougheed, I now make well over six figures and contribute more in taxes than was ever paid out to bring me up.

My grandma always votes for whoever is in power currently (because change freaks her out). My dad is voting PC because at least he knows what kind of trouble they will bring and doesnt want to deal with new issues that a new party may bring. Plus, there's a lot to sift through to figure it all out. I knew who I was voting for before I even looked at Vote Compass and it only confirmed it for me. If I had found it first, it could have saved me a lot of effort and energy.      I'm personally a little technophobic, but when technology can help people vote responsibly I am more than willing to embrace it. In my personal opinion, democracy works best when all people participate. And if it takes a silly website to accomplish it, I don't see the problem, but that's just me.

The biggest issue for me is establishing real envionmenral controls and protections and, in the words of Peter Lougheed, ""acting like owners,"" when it comes to our natural resources.

They are avoiding introducing a two-tiered medical system, which makes me happy, because two-tiered will not work out the way most people think it will.  The only thing I don't like about them is that they are bringing the corporate tax to 12%. I can agree with 11 or event 11.5%, but 12% will shock the economy and make Alberta a less attractive place to invest."

I legitimately don't understand how being tied for lowest corporate tax rate (outside Quebec which is an entirely different ball game) would cause so much grief.  Depending on the sector, there are still many other advantages that Alberta has (such as low cost of living compared to other larger cities, more high-income earners to allow for niche spending, and spinoff economies from resource sectors to name a few).

Now, there are some things a company can do to mitigate their losses, but to cover a 20% difference between 2015 and 2016 would mean that they would have to either cut jobs or consider moving their operations elsewhere (because BC and Ontario would be about as competitive at that point). I think if they were to go for 0.5% over a four year period, that would be better, but a sudden jump at that scale could have some very negative consequences.   My dream fiscal policy would be to bring corporate taxes to 11%, introduce a PST that would grow over a three year period to 3% and then allow municipalities more authority over taxation."

I believe that bolstering demand rather than supply is more effective in stimulating economic growth as well as being more democratic. Conservatives see cutting corporate taxes as stimulating supply. The major problem is most businesses privatize the cost savings as profit rather than passing on savings to consumers to actually stimulate growth since the market has already shown a willingness to pay. Bolstering demand would be like raising the threshold for the lowest tax bracket. Everyone pays less tax, including the rich. the poor see a bigger percentage of their income benefit and more people have money to spend on things that they need and want.  Social services end up costing us less money in the long run despite high up front costs. All governments generally do a bad job on selling the value that social services provide. Things like welfare get a bad rap because of a few well publicized cases were people are abusing the system.    Each prisoner in Canada's 54 federal penitentiaries costs taxpayers $117,788.  The average Canadian earns about $49,000 a year BEFORE taxes. If there's a chance that readily available social services mean that we'll have more people owning homes, raising their families well, paying their taxes it ultimately ends up costing me less and it makes Canada a better place to live.   I'm inspired by the Nordic model and I'm envious of the quality of life that they enjoy. I'd rather have nice neighbors, clean streets and a feeling of safety than live in a gated community with lots of money afraid that poor people only want to rob and murder me to make a quick buck."

I am in that so-called ""rich"" set, although I'm far from rich.  I don't mind paying a little bit more.  Granted, I'm not a greedy fuck and I recognize that a small increase doesn't harm me while it helps so many as a whole.    Bluntly, if you can't afford a 1.5% increase in your tax rate, you're nothing but a greedy fuck that doesn't give a shit about anyone else.  But that's my opinion."
alberta,348pzm,Windig0,-12,Wed Apr 29 15:08:36 2015 UTC,If you're not greedy then why don't you donate that money to charity? Why do you want the government to force you to help the poor instead of doing it yourself?
alberta,348pzm,ProudOppressor,11,Wed Apr 29 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"You think I don't?  Look, unlike most people's beliefs it seems, government serves a purpose, and that purpose costs money.  It's not about providing welfare to bums, its health care and education and investment in our future.  It's running towns, protecting infrastructure, and ensuring that the environment doesn't get fucked to hell.  It is a myriad of other things that we all need to have happen...it's not about ""charity"", as people like you would have us all believe.  Alberta has had artificially low taxes because of the boom of oil in this province for, well, as long as I've been alive really.  It's time that we properly fund operations through taxation like everyone else, and use oil to help offset while also saving for the rainy day that we are currently experiencing.  Don't get me wrong, government should be efficient too...but we need the regime for the most part, and its time we ALL paid our way."
alberta,348pzm,Kaelteth,-12,Wed Apr 29 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Alberta has had artificially high spending because of oil, not artificially low taxes.

The increased taxes means you have less to donate to an efficient charity, and instead that money will be spent on an inefficient bureaucracy. There is no benefit."

Liberty...lol...I don't believe that means what you think it means...you have every right of liberty.

alberta,348pzm,Kaelteth,-9,Wed Apr 29 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"I never said taxes are an affront to liberty; I was saying that it's logically inconsistent to consider healthcare a right because no individual is obligated to provide for you. A doctor is not your slave. You can have a public program for whatever you want, just don't pretend that it's anything more than a publicly provided private good. Don't abuse the word ""right"".

Nothing is ever gong to be perfect, but you can pick the best of the available choices, which accomplishes two important goals: First it ensures that the worst choice is voted against. That's critical, because a vote against modifies behaviour by making them examine why they were voted against. Secondly it means his best choice is more likely to gain power, which is a better option for governance going forward than having his worst choice in power."

On the topic of PCs, the only thing I can recall that they've done that's affected me directly and in a positive way was their decision to purchase corneas from the United States. This allowed me to go from sitting on a transplant wait list of up to 5 years to having it done on the 3rd year - and only two months after announcing that decision.

Since the provincial and federal elements of the party are of one institution, as opposed to other parties, they're seen as interconnected to the point that they must all be the same. Lastly, it seems like an easy narrative to drive: left wingers fuck IP gov't with their lofty ideals.   Firstly, Rae in Ontario was bad - but Wynne and McGuinty are arguably not far off. Indeed, Liberal governments have fucked the dog too. Secondly, a single look at Notley's platform indicates the the Alberta NDP are the closest to the center of all NDP parties. If the abndp are bowing to their masters then they're doing so to the effect of moving to the center. Lastly, let's remember how bad Harris fucked Ontario. As a Torontonian I can tell you we're still feeling that shit. He fucked us on the 407 sale.   Full disclosure, I'm an NDPer closer to the center than most of my party.

They really did send both of those provinces into chaos.  However, was that decades in the past? Yes. Are the Albertan NDP's different people from BC's and Sask's? Yes. Is the NDP leader apparently got some common sense and has proven she knows what the fuck she's talking about and has a balanced, stable budget? Yes.

Ralph Klein was at time harsh to the public sector, but always had a balanced budget and often a surplus. Stelmach and Redford both were not very good and didn't do well with the abundant revenue they were given. They spent too much during the good times which created the problem we are currently in. However,  I can't imagine an NDP or Liberal party making the same mistakes.  Prentice's plan sounds reasonable moving forward. I think his plan to use 50% of oil revenue while saving 50% is a fair balance. I like him and think he has what it takes to guide Alberta forward."

They live in a rural riding and are voting PC pretty much just to try to prevent the Wildrose from taking their seat. Although they're mostly Conservative in ideology, they still have a general dislike/distrust of the Wildrose Party. They're not really happy with the PC's - but the only other option is the NDP which isn't really where they align ideologically and who doesn't likely stand much chance of winning even with the NDP on the rise. So they're holding their nose and voting PC again simply because they don't want to be represented by a Wildrose MLA.   I can't speak for them beyond this and this is merely one example - but I could see this realistically playing out with some rural voters, as I know there's a handful of rural ridings without full slates of candidates anyways."

So does she vote for a party that she hates and has no confidence in because they best align with her values; or vote for another party whose political platform she can't stand behind because she doesn't trust Prentice and the party she best identifies with?"

Is it the exact plan that I want? No, is their track record that they could completely blow it? yup.  That said I would rather vote for the best plan in my opinion (quick balance the budget, pay off debt, get the heritage fund going). I was considering WR until the debate, and on further examination I don't think we can cut that hard and have it all work out in the end.  We're extremely fortunate in Alberta that all 3 parties will eventually balance the budget because it's pretty simple to do when/if resource revenue returns. The major question for me is how do we get off the reliance on resource revenue and the PC's seem to be the only one that wants to address that."

There is no great evil being forced upon people in scandinavia for some future good (in my mind, anyways).  The fact that scandinavian countries have such high levels of happiness should be pulling economists and sociologists from everywhere to try to determine why scandinavians are so happy.  Certainly, I do not know that instituting leftist social and economic policies will improve Alberta; it is possible that Alberta will crash and burn. But conservatives warned seattle that their upping of minimum wage to $15 was going to absolutely ruin their economy, and they are doing better than ever. I understand conservatism, and the reasoning behind it... When would one ever be willing to try a new economic layout? If it really doesn't work, A PC can be elected in 4 years and Alberta will be right back to normal.  Albertans in particular seem to be incredibly afraid of taxes. I do not understand this. It's not like you're dumping your money into a fire. This money is going to pay for schools, healthcare, infrastructure, etc.  Even if you are very entrenched in your conservative ways, do you agree that trickle-down economics has been soundly proven incorrect?

Secondly remember the redford scam? Why on earth would you be in favor for increased taxes if the highest provincial figure was caught in such a large scam? The common arguments are ""If only we had the right party/person in power, we could spend properly!"" to which I say will never happen.  Government = waste, and the less resources the government has the less powerful it is, the more people are free to do whatever they wish.  The ideal system is having people be free to do as they wish as long as they don't interfere with the rights of others."
alberta,346vkj,john-b,2,Wed Apr 29 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"Hm, you give me food for thought.  Perhaps our thinkings diverge here: I think that a member of society has a moral duty to pay taxes, and contribute to the betterment of the society in which they live. Taxes are not something that the government takes viciously from you, but a way for everyone to contribute to the improvement of society as a whole, particularly on ventures which would be impossible to fund if everyone did their own. If you like, taxes can be thought of as your personal bill for water, infrastructure, police, etc.  Are you forced to pay the bill of an electrician who did some work for you? Obviously not; it is a deliberate exchange of your money for some work that the electrician did. I think that taxes are perfectly analogous, but more conceptually difficult to grasp, since (unlike the electrician) there is no specific action that the government uses your taxes for.  Do you agree or disagree with this? I am curious.  Unfortunately, I do not remember the redford scam. I only arrived in alberta 8 months ago. But googled redford scam... Are you speaking of Alison Redford??  Regardless, I am not sold on the idea that government is bad based on one report of government corruption. Obviously, there are many more examples of government corruption, but I would point to the at least equivalently numerous cases of corporate corruption (lol, Enron?). Unless you are also interested in abolishing corporations, I think that we can both agree that several instances of corruption are not an effective basis for determining the quality of a system.  I very much agree with your last line... but how to maximize that freedom? I do not think that fewer rules necessarily equates to more freedom.  This has been a pretty good exchange so far... thanks for your thoughts! Sorry if these posts are getting a little long."
alberta,34853u,ircanadian,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:36:53 2015 UTC,Just proves that House of Cards isn't that far off base.
alberta,348pxd,ircanadian,11,Wed Apr 29 04:37:01 2015 UTC,"First, about myself: I'm young (late 20's), well educated and work as a professional in the O&G industry. I'm a fiscal conservative, social liberal (Libertarian is the closest fit to my beliefs). I believe in small government that interferes minimally in both economic and social issues and I'm completely non-religious (Atheist).  Unfortunately there is no party that fits my values. In fact, on many issues (especially social ones), I agree with the Liberals (not so much the NDP as I don't feel they have a clue), but I care far more about the economy than the rest of the platform and that pretty much just leaves 2 options: PC's or WR.   PC's need to go. I think we can all agree on that. It's far past due. The corruption, entitlement and continued incompetence has on for far too long. Liberals in Alberta are a complete joke. They have been for as long as I've been alive and until they radically revamp things and change their name, they always will be. A vote for them is basically a spoiled ballot. The Alberta party I admittedly know quite little about, but the fact they're only running 35 candidates means at this point they aren't a serious party. The Green party aren't really worth mentioning, but here they are. The NDP will kill investment in the O&G industry with a royalty review, raise corporate taxes and put me and many others out of business. I run O&G economics for a living and I know how razor thin the line between huge profits and uneconomic development is. But even bigger than that is the risk factors associated with another royalty review. Investment (especially on large, capital intensive projects) will dry up instantly as companies await the results and there is always a residual risk factor associated with that uncertainty. Think about this for a minute: As a company you're investing a billion dollars into a project where you won't even see a dime of income until year 5-10. You've already poured 300 million into the project only to have the rules changed on you midway through and now that project is deemed uneconomic. You're now out 300 million with a half-finished project that's costing you money just being there (not even accounting for reclamation costs) and no longer have any means of recovering that investment. Are you going to invest in Alberta in the near future? Ever again? THIS is what the NDP would do and it would kill our economy.   That leaves 1 option, the Wild Rose. And while I don't agree with all of their viewpoints, I DO agree with their economic policy and that's enough to be the lesser evil."
alberta,348pxd,g_gundy,5,Wed Apr 29 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with you on what the NDP would do with oil and gas. The NDP are in power in Manitoba right now and under that government the province has been having a nice oil boom in the southwest (near Brandon). The NDP in Saskatchewan also helped usher in that province's oil boom.  I respect you choice, though. Libertarians in Canada have few options when it comes to political parties. While I haven't exactly been impressed with Jean as a potential premier, at least he is against PC corruption and entitlement and has jettisoned most of the Wildrose's anti-city, anti-environment, and anti-homosexual tendencies."
alberta,348pxd,Ex_Officio15,3,Wed Apr 29 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"Different oilfields have vastly different economics. Manitoba has lagged behind Alberta in its development of resources (in large part due to government policies). Most production is light, sweet oil which is relatively ""easy"" and cheap to produce. The equivalent oilfields in Alberta have long since been drilled up. Manitoba also benefited greatly from innovations and cost reductions from these innovations that have been developed elsewhere (a lot of which came from those ""equivalent"" fields) as well as infrastructure development in nearby Saskatchewan and the US.  It should also be noted that virtually all of the major Manitoba operators are still headquartered in Alberta (Calgary, specifically) and that much of the educated workforce for those companies is located here.  EDIT: I'm not overly impressed with Jean has a candidate either, but as you said, there are few viable options available and it comes down the lesser evil. One thing I do expect, however, is that a WR government would likely be a minority government and would probably face much more resistance enacting right-wing social policies than economic ones. I'm hopeful that if elected that is enough of a deterrent to stay at least somewhat progressive socially."

alberta,348pxd,g_gundy,3,Wed Apr 29 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"What measures in the NDP platform do you believe will cripple the oil and gas industry? Increasing corporate taxes by two percentage points isn't going to do it on it's own. The NDP aren't stupid. They know oil is the lifeblood of this province, and they will likely conduct royalty review in a way that gets Albertans a better deal but still allows the industry to be viable."
alberta,348pxd,amkamins,5,Wed Apr 29 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"Read what I wrote above. Even IF they do a royalty review and things turn out to not cripple the industry (which seems HIGHLY unlikely after seeing the initial results of the last one), there will always be an inherent ""regime risk"" that as a company you need to factor into your economic calculations. If you're not familiar, it's basically a risk factor to account for government meddling/changing of the rules midway through your investment- something that is CRUCIAL when dealing with foreign investment, but not something that has typically been needed for Alberta investment.  Also, I don't think you understand just how much of an effect a 20% corporate tax increase (10% to 12%) would have. That would be a huge hit- and not just to the O&G industry. If you want to quickly become a have-not province and have companies fleeing elsewhere to put their operations/headquarters, a 20% increase to corporate taxes is a damn good start."

alberta,348pxd,amkamins,3,Wed Apr 29 20:26:46 2015 UTC,The last royalty review immediately halted many projects and almost completely halted land sale revenues. That investment only came back when the initial review was revamped to the point projects were economic again.

alberta,348pxd,amkamins,3,Thu Apr 30 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"Here's an article that details it fairly well. A few things of note: this was BEFORE the economic downturn and immediately following the Alberta royalty review, BC set records for land sale numbers.   Another thing that was of note: the royalty review was supposed to bring in an extra $2 billion a year in royalties. Alberta immediately dropped $2 billion in land sales from 2006. That isn't to say land sales are flat year over year or that all of the $2 billion drop was because of the royalty review, but it's quite clear that it was a major factor.  EDIT: Figured I'd add a TL;DR section with the most important parts of the article.   The land sale numbers in that province bear him out. Whereas Alberta's land sale tally fell more than $2 billion, or 60 per cent, B.C. had a record year in 2007 by cracking $1 billion in gross sales for the first time, shattering the previous record of $647 million set in 2003.  Its final land sale of the year on Dec. 12 netted the province a whopping $418 million. By contrast, Alberta's final sale of the year on the same day brought in a paltry $37 million.  At $1,758, B.C.'s average price per hectare was more than five times the $379.66 generated in Wild Rose Country."

A knee jerk reaction to a dip in oil prices will cause us to agree to much more than we were bargained for in the long term. Undoing those tax increases is next to impossible. Wildrose is not just a ""PC Party"". It was created from the parts that still believe in fiscal accountability and government accountability. Less red tape, and placing each business on a level platform by eliminating corporate welfare handouts. People are all ""Bla bla bla... the DEBATE"", however if they actually took the time to research what they were signing up for, no way would the PC platform or the NDP platform make sense. If they are taking 10's of billions extra out of taxpayer pockets over the course of the next 4 years, how many private industry jobs will be lost?

alberta,347xqe,terabane,2,Wed Apr 29 02:58:41 2015 UTC,Actually many people in the states argue that government funding of private and charter schools is a big reason why public schools in some areas have gone down hill. They leach away the best teachers and administrators because of higher pay and smaller classes that are easier to handle and have fewer problem students and the public schools are left with the worst of everything.

alberta,343v6d,darmog,15,Tue Apr 28 02:20:13 2015 UTC,"I recently had the honour of debating a PC member who identified himself as an economist. He proceeded to tell me that business often operates on a 3% margin. And an increase would destroy them or they'd move. As a business owner I can tell you, NOBODY runs a 3% margin, nobody. You'd have to have incredibly deep pockets to last a year at that margin. Depending on industry, businesses will operate from a 20-100% margin. The PCs are corporate shills, and it's just blatant fear mongering."
alberta,343v6d,keepcalmdude,8,Tue Apr 28 02:53:17 2015 UTC,"This is a massive overgeneralization.  The only industries that are consistently seeing margins above 20% are finance (including real estate) and wireless. There are plenty of industries in which margin is measured in the single digits. Retail is one.  Relevant to Alberta, oil and gas is another.  It is arguably true that small businesses might run generally higher margins, but beware of survivorship bias.  You might say that your business runs a particular margin, but to report the average of your industry you must also include all the businesses that have lost money.  You might only be persisting at that margin because the barriers to entry are high enough and the payoff too small to attract competent competitors. That, or you're failing to properly average your margin over years in which you don't make money.  In the same way that you can't translate the experience of a household's finances to a country's, you can't really translate the experience of a small business to billion dollar multinationals.  Multinationals can issue bonds, they can survive years of unprofitability because they do have monstrously deep pockets and they can and will undercut competition by fractions of a percentage point, or make decisions in the face of marginal tax increases because those changes can be worth tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars.   Look at the net margins of the biggest publicly traded employers in Alberta. I tried to find 5 year averages for all of these.:   Safeway - 2-3% Canadian Pacific - 14% Agrium - 6% Shaw - 14% Suncor - 9% Stantec - 6% ATCO - 9% Ensign Energy - 7% Enbridge - 3% Westjet- 6% Canadian Utilities - 18% Precision Drilling - 4% The Brick (owned by Leon's) - 6% Canadian Natural Resources - 14% Trican - 4% Syncrude  - 24%   I listed 16 companies.  Only Syncrude is above 20%, and only CNQ, Shaw and CP are also above 10%.  There are 7 in the 6-9% range, and 5 in the sub-5% range.  Apparently, the profit margin of the S+P 500 is about 9%, so this is right in the same ballpark.  Outside Syncrude, no big company is running a 20-100% margin, and plenty of them are running near 3%, so your PC economist isn't exactly wrong.  Now, whether those companies move due to a tax hike isn't obvious.  I think most of them wouldn't move since they are only profiting because there are resources here to profit off of, but I'm not informed enough to know how mobile they are, and what opportunities they have on the margin.  They say a 1% increase in corporate tax would generate $500 million in revenue.  Realistically, that does mean that corporations in the province are making $500 million less in profit.  Now, I agree, if your profit is $200k, you're really only out an extra $2k.  Too bad, the Christmas party is a toonie bar now.  But if your profit is $1B, now you're out $10M.  Chump change in the face of $1B for sure, but a big enough number to make someone wonder if they shouldn't be investing somewhere else."
alberta,343v6d,scienceisfun,8,Tue Apr 28 06:07:18 2015 UTC,Except that 1% increase in corporate tax rate still puts Alberta tied for the bottom of the tax barrel. So nobody is moving.
alberta,343v6d,Kaelteth,0,Tue Apr 28 12:47:16 2015 UTC,It isn't that companies will move. But they will shift that one centre or close it down. Or They reduce their capital spending. All of this over all the oil and gas companies will result in some jobs lost.
alberta,343v6d,OperatingLine,8,Tue Apr 28 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"""It Depends""  Look, there's no doubt that a 1% tax rate increase will hit a corporation's bottom line.  That may bean some job losses, at least in theory.  However, there's the other side of the economic coin.  Corporations are out for one thing, and one thing only - maximization of profit.  Period, end of discussion.  Now, if things are actually unprofitable, yeah, you get cuts in spending and cuts in people.  But generally speaking, a 1% tax rate hike isn't going to tip a company that is solid into a company that is underwater.  So you tax them a bit more...they're still going to maximize their profit.  Now, if they could actually get away with fewer people, they will...but the reality of this is you need human capital to achieve your peak financial profit.  That 1% in tax doesn't change the number of people you need to produce your goods, or sell your services.  If anything, as long as there is profit in it, companies will invest and expand so that they achieve the same or greater profits, instead of contracting which may further shrink profit levels.  Now, you add in what the NDP proposes in a Job Creation Tax Incentive, and suddenly the incentive to invest and expand all by itself offsets the tax hike...so they may create new jobs so that the tax break helps offset the tax increase.  THAT if anything is smart business, and would further enrich the province with the new jobs paying income tax/etc.  Overall, you have to take a balanced approach in everything.  The tax advantage of Alberta must be maintained so that people don't slink off to lower taxed areas, but you also have to promote investment in jobs at the same time.  IMHO, this is the thing that conservatism fails to grasp - they give away money to corporations, and/or keep taxes stupid low, but it almost places disincentives on expansion and job creation...why invest capital to expand when we've maxed out our profit sitting still?  Economics is a highly inexact ""science"" - it really is an art form in many ways.  The problem IMHO is you ahve the left and the right catering entirely to one side...nobody seems to come up the middle and try to ride the wave on both sides of the fence.  But in a balanced approach, IMHO we WILL get the best economic gains with the greatest levels of tax ""profit"" for the Province."
alberta,343v6d,Kaelteth,8,Tue Apr 28 17:48:42 2015 UTC,That 10M on 1B profit isn't going to be the difference between operating in Alberta and saying fuck it we're moving to Venezuela either.
alberta,343v6d,amkamins,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:49:10 2015 UTC,"Of course not, but $10M is 200 people making $50k.  So maybe to cut from a $10M profit loss to a $5M loss, you lay off 100 people to lower your overhead.  And there are an equivalent of 49 other same-sized companies that have to make a similar decision.  My point is only that if you take $500M of profit out of industry, don't be surprised if industry cuts a good chunk of that out of their overhead.  Now, if it can be established that the government can do more with that $500M, then yeah, that's a good trade.  Honestly, I think it can be a good trade.  But a corporate tax increase will probably result in at least temporary job loss.  It's short-sighted to ignore that, and we should be cognizant of the fact that those people who lose their jobs might end up shouldering more of the province's financial burden then they ought to."
alberta,343v6d,scienceisfun,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"Take that same amount of money out of the same amount of local businesses from people's lowered spending capacity due to increased taxes on their end and the same layoffs occur to protect the same business's bottom line.  My point is it doesn't matter if it's decreased spending capacity or increased taxes, both harm business. To hold business taxes as sacrosanct while feeling that there's no problem if you increase personal taxes to me shows that they either don't understand or don't care."
alberta,343v6d,keepcalmdude,5,Wed Apr 29 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"Your comment and source are misleading. These figure show a Net profit margin, which is usually an internal number and doesn't reflect how much profit is actually being made by these companies. These companies are making massive profits far exceeding these numbers. A better comparison would be gross profit margin OR profit on sales. That said, a small increase in corporate taxes won't drive business out of Alberta en masse. I can say that a large in crease would, but at the end of the day corporations should also be held to account in our economic times, the burden should NOT be entirely on the citizens."
alberta,343v6d,scienceisfun,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"Hardly misleading.  In a discussion about corporate tax, net margin is the relevant item, since taxes come out of net income.  Yes, gross profits in these industries can be rather large.  Costs too.    Net margin is also definitely not an internal measure; it is literally a company's bottom line, reported by virtually all publicly traded companies.  My point was that it was your comment that was misleading.  An economist saying that certain companies run on 3% margins and are sensitive to tax increases is not at all wrong, because it is clear that net margin is what's being discussed.  Saying that the economist is wrong and that companies are actually running 20-100% margins, but referring to a completely different type of margin (either gross or operating) is disingenuous.  I agree with the notion that a 1-2% corporate tax increase is not going to drive off major businesses from the province, and that corporations should shoulder some of the tax burden, but we shouldn't be making up false narratives to support that position."
alberta,343v6d,JeffBoner,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:55:05 2015 UTC,"What he's saying is accountants try to maximize expenses for tax purposes to show less taxable income to pay less tax. So things like depreciation which doesn't cost anything in actual cash is included. So the numbers you have really mean nothing to the viability of s business.   Also oil and gas have enormously distorted net income numbers which is why when analyzing them you look at cash flow instead.   Utilities are regulated like ATCO so the profit cannot by law be that much. AUC regulates the amount they can charge on a cost + profit amount.   Grocery is slim margins yes. But when transport costs went up, food prices went up. Same thing would happen with taxes. If any grocer wants to move out, whole foods and save on foods will be happy to expand and fill their void where applicable, assuming whole foods flagship store is successful."

What do you think would happen if Alberta reduced personal taxes to zero and raised only corporate taxes to make up the shortfall?
alberta,343v6d,ramenoodle12,3,Tue Apr 28 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"Well, its a stupid exercise, but the taxes in Alberta for corporations would far exceed other provinces, and many business would move to provinces where the tax rate wasn't fucking them.  The problem in looking at the extremes is its extremely stupid.  Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, is suggesting that corps should be taxed to hell and back.  What is literally being proposed is to make our corporate tax rate equal to the next lowest provinces.  Under that scenario, nobody is going to spend the capital to move to another province.  SO basically, while I see what you are trying to argue, you're going about it like a retard."
alberta,343v6d,Sidewinder77,-1,Tue Apr 28 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't argue anything, I simply posed a question.  I think you're right that those who support lowering corporate taxes like to say that all corporations will go elsewhere if corporate taxes are raised. It's a nice way to use fear to get people to stop thinking. I used to go along with that.   If corporate taxes were raised without lowering any other taxes, I would expect some corporations to go elsewhere. Corporations are often more mobile than families. However, in this case if income taxes were eliminated, workers would be keeping a lot more of their paycheck. If their jobs were threatened after corporate taxes were jacked, they could accept significantly lower wages and still be left with perhaps exactly the same after tax income. Corporate profit margins could be unaffected.  What really matters to job creators is the total cost of taxes, regulation, cost of living, workforce wages, etc that ultimately affects the final profit margin. When it comes to taxes, the less that government extracts from the economy in any form of tax (corporate, income, sales, property), the more attractive a place it will be for companies to operate and create jobs. Politicians that try to fool voters into just looking at one form of a tax vs the other are either deceiving people or ignorant of economics."

Chances are that it will be less once they stop buying the interest rate down, but if you're financing you will probably pay more for a 7 year loan than that.   Your dealer can probably also tell you that, they'll definitely know and are usually pretty helpful when it comes to saving money on the manufacturers dime."
alberta,3436hd,electricsandstorm,2,Tue Apr 28 01:57:10 2015 UTC,Get a car cost Canada report to see the invoice price and add 3% to that. That's your pre gst price target.   Keep in mind 0% interest just means that additional profit is built in to the vehicle sales price. So don't worry about it. Sales guys are trying to hit their end of month numbers so if anything you'll have more leeway.   In all honesty buy a one year old model and save yourself a ton of cash and see no real difference.
alberta,3436hd,JeffBoner,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"Delivery and destination is a bogus 'fee'. You are under no obligation to pay it. If you were, it would be part of the sticker price.  Legally in Alberta, dealers MUST honor advertised prices, taxes aside."
alberta,3436hd,scratch_043,3,Mon Apr 27 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"That is actually wrong. Freight is a very real fee for the shipping of the car and is completely legal as long as disclosed as part of the advertised price (it will appear on the monroney sticker on a new car, and is generally charged by the manufacturer to the dealer based on a pre-set shipping cost table).  Anything not disclosed on the sale price is when fees become illegal. Technically you could advertise admin fees and it would be legal but no less bogus.  Examples of actual fees which are just a cash grab: admin, doc, pdi, ""air"" tax, there are many more.  Examples of fees which are for a legitimate service, but should be included in the sale price: undercoating, vin etching, a/c tax, tire tax (new vehicles only), AMVIC levy.  TL;DR, a lot of those fees are actual taxes and a lot of them are bogus, they are allowed to make up bogus fees but they cant spring them on you after advertising, or negotiating to a price.  Edit: in the situation OP described, ""starting price"" is the MSRP for that car, ""destination and delivery"" is freight, ""other taxes and levies"" looks about like standard a/c,tire, and AMVIC, but a detailed breakdown is needed to check that. If the other taxes is on an advertisement it is totally above board - but if it is just a bogus fee you shouldn't pay it anyways."
alberta,3436hd,electricsandstorm,2,Tue Apr 28 01:41:10 2015 UTC,"I absolutely refuse to discuss these fees with a dealer. My line is ""all I want to talk about is the final price of this vehicle. I don't care what my fees are or what the bill looks like- you can figure that out. The only number I will discuss is the grand total, all in number."" If they won't do this, I walk out the door immediately.  On the other hand, I won't go over the top in dickering with them. I won't put up with bullshit. But if they are willing to discard the bullshit, I am willing to pay an extra couple hundred dollars on the vehicle so that they don't have to try to nickle and dime me."

My undergrad degree in Psychology does not lead to any specific position. So, I finished my exams a few weeks ago and just came to Fort McMurray to stay with my parents for a while. I figure that by being in this province, employers would take me more seriously."
alberta,33y8vy,karmainall,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by employers taking you more seriously.  I graduated last year and two months later found an entry level job with decent pay & benefits. But I was very lucky because the HR person knew me from a volunteering event years ago.  If you have no connections in Alberta  that you can pursue for a job then I would recommend going to a talent/recruiting agency asap.  I have not looked around on the job market since last year but if it is still the same I can tell you that it is very difficult for new grads to find decent paying jobs with benefits. Many good jobs are in the ""hidden job market"" that is only accessible via connections. You need to start thinking how you can translate what you learned into real skills and put that on paper."
alberta,33y8vy,karmainall,0,Sun Apr 26 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. By 'take me more seriously', I mean that I am available to meet businesses in person, if that might help. Fort Mac is far, but not as far as Toronto. Yes, recruiting agencies are a good idea, didn't think of that. I want to start by targeting specific jobs rather than randomly sending as many resumes as I can, if jobs here are becoming scarce. But at least there is money here... median pay is 20k less in Ontario."
alberta,33y8vy,Vaguswarrior,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:33:09 2015 UTC,"Oh wow 20k/year, I didn't know Ontario was that bad. Is that even a living wage? By the way, do not show up at businesses unannounced and expect an interview.....employers hate that....It's okay to drop off your resume though. Good luck on job hunting! Remember to ask for a high starting wage and have good reasons to back up why you deserve it. If the company wants you then they will negotiate."
alberta,33y8vy,Vaguswarrior,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:21:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah... it is because part time positions are really common. My school, U of Toronto, had a huge strike this year because TAs were only getting paid $15 000 per year. Which is not livable at all, especially in Toronto. I'm a young guy with a good degree. I would rather risk it all and move to Alberta than be trapped in mediocrity for the next ten years in Ontario, fighting for just a full time job. Anyways, if the white collar office job doesn't work out, I'd still be making more money working in the Oil Sands here in Fort Mac than back there.

How many times did he go after corporations, 0.  One of the reasons were in this mess is PC's have wasted millions in corporate welfare, Wildrose will eliminate corporate welfare completely.""   I believe it says on their website they are ending 450 million in corporate subsidies, and 250 million in the public sector by laying off 6000 government workers.  So it actually sounds to me like Wildrose could have actually been better than the PC's at handling the economy, and they are actually advertising a more balanced approach to our budget issues.

Our criminal law is built around this federal legislation, and the Alberta legislature really has no power to change federal law (in this case, the CDSA)."

What and who exactly does have the authority to actually make modifications to the CDSA standards?"
alberta,33s7yl,unjung,11,Sat Apr 25 03:30:22 2015 UTC,NDP can't do anything provincially as I understand it. The criminal code (federal) would have to be amended or overturned by a court.

alberta,33s7yl,AntonBanton,2,Sat Apr 25 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"There's a reason they call it the supreme court. Though the technicalities of it may differ in between how the US and Canada are run, basically it is a province / state can make a decision to change a law provincially, they are at the whim of federal law, ultimately.  Say, the Edmonton police would look the other way if a bylaw were implemented, but the RCMP would still press charges, and I think that a dispensary would incur some heavy criminal distribution charges.  I think the reason it is more relaxed in the US is that regular police forces are state run, the federal government would have to send in specialized narc units and it wouldn't be financially feasible.  This is my speculative understanding, if clarification or correction is to be made, I have no qualms."

Marijuana legalization is good because it deprives organized crime of revenue, stops wasting the justice system's time, and prevents people's lives from being ruined just because of their choice of recreation.   But legalizing marijuana is not a large generator of revenue. It does get the government a little bit of money, but it's a trivial amount in comparison to the budget as a whole, and it certainly won't plug a 9 percent gap between the province's taxes and its spending.

It's hard to do the politics of ""tough on crime"" while also legalizing marijuana—the public would see it as a two-faced thing to do.   That said, even the Conservatives have talked about making it possible for police officers to just give people fines for marijuana possession, rather than having to charge them with a criminal offence. I actually don't know what happened to that idea of theirs; it was a while ago that they were discussing it."

It is my opinion that society would be much better off with no alcohol, no tobacco, and no cannabis, but we saw how well prohibition worked out before, and so while I accept it's not feasible to make those illegal, I'm not prepared to agree with adding a 3rd item to that list.

Everything in moderation. Im not opposed to peoples opinions, but if Canada actually wants to be a free nation, this just seems like a no-brainer. Harpers 7 million dollar anti-weed campaign mentioned some key points regarding the harms, but that ad was also completely biased and didn't actually weigh the pros and cons to make an informed decision.

For Canada to change it's laws regarding pot without being coordinated with the U.S. would be nightmarish for cross-border trade and tourism.

So the rate was greatly reduced for wells in the first year of production, which would then go up significantly once those wells reached a threshold. The thought was it would kickstart a lot of natural gas production, which was where the action was. This had significant support amongst many groups.  No one predicted the crash in natural gas, which slumped production and industry expansion. There's no incentive to push production on wells to reach that threshold. The cash cow dried up. IF natural gas prices ever recover, we would be swimming in cash. I don't see that happening anytime soon.  At least, that's how I understand it.

alberta,33ree2,Sidewinder77,2,Fri Apr 24 23:29:16 2015 UTC,Not really. Are those more useful comparisons? Alberta oil is not cheap to extract. Are we doing ourselves any favours by selling it at such a huge loss? More likely we are just subsidizing cheaper shale in the States.
alberta,33ree2,jungoh,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"I would say they're very useful. The capital that is invested in Alberta is very closely competing with BC shale and Saskatchewan oilsands. Since Alberta raised royalties above what those other provinces charge, oil drillers can make more money by shifting investment and jobs there.

Saudi Arabia takes 85% of profit and Norway takes 80% of profit – both three times as much as Alberta. Newfoundland/Hibernia takes 30% to 50% of profit plus 7.5% of gross revenue – twice as much as Alberta.""  That's not implying Alberta should be more like the Saudis?

If true, there are a few things we should be careful about:  a) We must stop downvoting people because they have different beliefs.  If someone has conservative values, and its a healthy debate, and they are adding to the conversation, by no means does that deserve a downvote (in fact it strictly does not).  Trying to silence desenting opinions (and facts! no one's party is without its issues!) is a great way to push undecided voters away from your party and isn't how this is supposed to work.  b) We mustn't be overconfident thinking we are surrounded by opinions representative to Alberta as a whole.  We very much are not.    This means firstly that, even if you believe your riding, city, or province is going to easily elect your preferred party, you must go out and vote.  There is no guarantee that any information we have, from our own experiences and interactions, to these random-sampling polls, are representative in any meaningful way.    Secondly, we shouldn't just circle jerk our way to a loss, spinning our tires here with like minded people - we must reach out to as many of our fellow Albertans as we can to insist that they are both informed, and will actually vote.  I feel like pasting the following 3 links OUTSIDE of reddit will go a heck of a long way to making our democracy at least semi functional:   Voter compass quiz (5 minutes) Official platform points (20 minutes) Leaders debate (1 hour)   The push should be to create an informed and active voter base, not to push our agenda."

alberta,33o40i,A1terTheEnding,3,Fri Apr 24 11:21:47 2015 UTC,Wild rose is the only party that will not increase taxes.
alberta,33o40i,MCPEN15,2,Sat Apr 25 05:57:57 2015 UTC,Hahahaha. That is the best/worst editing job I've ever seen.
alberta,33nyl0,electricsandstorm,16,Fri Apr 24 01:53:42 2015 UTC,My tentative support for the Wildrose is done after that painful performance. I'm actually insulted that that's what they figured our support boiled down to. This isn't the party that it used to be when they had new ideas and were an amazingly effective opposition. This is Notley's game to lose now I think.
alberta,33nyl0,High_Tower,5,Fri Apr 24 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"What new ideas did they ever have? I'm honestly curious because to me it all seemed to boil down to ""don't tax oil companies"" with a dash of ""the gays are bad."""
alberta,33nyl0,GlassBoxes,8,Fri Apr 24 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"Prior to last election, when I first got involved with the party, they had a number of ideas that drew me in. Most of these ideas had examples elsewhere in the world.   Some of them that I remember are...  -A healthcare system similar to the German system.  -An education system with a funding model where a portion of funding follows the students. This funded schools beyond a base funding on a per capita basis and allowed parents to have a choice of how and where their kids went to school.  -A voter recall system and a system for citizen initiated referenda. They also wanted to work with the Federal government to better institutionalize elections for Alberta senators.  -The party was committed to free votes. On budget votes they said they would confer amongst themselves and find a consensus, but for everything else it was a strong ideal to allow the caucus to vote freely.  -They were committed to restoring and responsibly running the Heritage Trust Fund.  -They wanted to protect property rights. This was the issue that originally drew in rural Albertans. Land being annexed for transmission lines and some pretty horrendous PC bills at the time made this a chief issue. They also wanted to push to see land rights enshrined in the federal charter.  -MLA expenses were to receive tougher regulation and where going to be publicly available online. A long with the creation of an independent board for reviewing MLA pay.  -A whistleblower protection program for government employees to safely report inefficiencies and misuses of public money.  -They wanted to restructure the Alberta Human rights commission so that it was a division of the courts.  -There was a market driven diversification strategy. I’ve forgotten the details.  All of that has fallen by the wayside as the party crumbled, and I've lost hope that it will come back.  Being an old member, I can tell you that the party wasn’t remotely as homophobic or racist as they were cast. Certainly there were many of the old fashioned folks who were personally uncomfortable with gays, or critical of them due to religion, but they general took the Voltaire ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."" approach.  Where they really got caught during the election though was in their defense of the conscientious objectors. Defense of doctors or priests whose religious morals prevented them from accommodating homosexuals. That Voltaire defense may sound pretty, but damn is that ever bad politics in practice. That’s me being an apologist anyways.  This got way longer than I meant for it too. Sorry."

alberta,33ntfz,Cord87,10,Fri Apr 24 17:06:58 2015 UTC,I was watching clips from the debate on global's website (I couldn't find a full broadcast for some reason). I was struck by the scene at 2:14 into this video (http://globalnews.ca/video/1958342/alberta-leaders-debate-a-coalition). It looked like Prentice was helping Notley out because Jean kept interrupting her. That was nice.  I'm not from Alberta and am generally an NDP supporter but I will give some credit to Prentice. He is a good communicator. I still think Notley did better but Prentice did not appear overly partisan but more reasonable (as did all the leaders actually except for Jean).  edit: changed the word pragmatic to reasonable

alberta,33ntfz,Megaranger,-5,Fri Apr 24 01:48:23 2015 UTC,I found Brian Jean to be concise yet withdrawn. Prentice essentially said nothing about any of his plans save for flowery inspirational speeches. Rachel Notley had a very creepy smile on the whole time.
alberta,33ntfz,wildrosin,-8,Fri Apr 24 04:07:06 2015 UTC,Anyone who thinks it is a good idea to vote same party in power for 13 terms deserves to have a corrupt entitled government. Anyone who thinks that voting NDP who has run every economy they have every got in control of into the ground and thinks it will be different is the definition of insanity. That leaves an intelligent voter with one choice a fresh party who believes in using our taxes dollars responsible.

Notley was all over the place and couldn't even keep her math straight. Maybe Prentice's offended some SJW, but it doesn't make it less true.  And before you all get butt hurt, even the Nation Post agrees. Wildrose Party Leader Brian Jean won over voters."
alberta,33ntfz,Ex_Officio15,2,Fri Apr 24 03:28:06 2015 UTC,What? Jean just repeated the same No Taxes! Line over and over again and did his best to dodge any hard question lobbed at him. I have no love for the PCs but Prentice made a great point that the Wildrose won't admit how they're going to fund anything without making massive cuts if they refuse to raise the revenue streams. Notley was the only one up there with a plausible scheme for raising revenues.

alberta,33m9tx,dakdestructo,7,Fri Apr 24 02:01:02 2015 UTC,Staff at the Edmonton Beverly Clairview NDP campaign office told me they have few street signs because their was so much demand for the signs on private property that they didn't have enough to put elsewhere.

Declined ballots are only legislated in the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta; the option is only available for provincial elections.   During the 2000 Canadian federal election, a number of voters (chiefly in Edmonton, Alberta) ate their ballots, as part of what they dubbed the Edible Ballot Society, to protest what they saw as inherently unfair elections.

As a seasoned debater and long time politician he was very ungracious and quite petty. In the end he had nothing new to say.  If he had been gracious and a little more relaxed he probably would have been able to salvage this debate.  Older folks, the PCs base, don't necessarily like a rude and boorish whiner.  Who was that really old guy?  Swann is no Lawrence Decore, that's for sure."
alberta,33nxqg,Bleatmop,2,Fri Apr 24 14:25:33 2015 UTC,"Swann was abysmal. I could have fallen asleep every time he talked. A debate is no time to get into minutia of policy but instead to engage your audience by saying what you will do in general and contrast it with why your opponents are wrong. He is also an awful public speaker, literally reading off a page at some points. He should have been looking down the barrel of the camera when giving his opening address and a mix of that and at his opponent when in free debate. Looking down at a paper while speaking is just poor form and it speaks to the Liberals competency that they would have him as a party leader."

In fact, I might just move into a rental apartment and invest my equity in China instead where returns are higher. Do you get where I'm going with this analogy?

By the premier's own words, does this mean the government is putting back something that “was not an effective tax measure.”  As pointed out, he hasn't said where he's going to cut to make up for that $90 million.  I recall this tax break coming in after a grant program for charities was cut in 2009. Oh and again in 2013.  The PCs wanted this election to be a vote on the budget.

alberta,339dwm,jamiesg,3,Mon Apr 20 21:31:40 2015 UTC,as far as i can understand it those numbers are all relative to the PC budget. yes it is saying we will spend more in the first 3 years. that being said i think the PC budget was already going to run a deficit.

alberta,339dwm,jamiesg,5,Tue Apr 21 00:00:30 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, spending into a deficit can actually be quite smart. To use the good ol' household finances analogy, can you imagine what kind of assets you'd have if you only purchased what you can afford at the present moment?   We have mortgages and auto-debts for a reason. We're willing to pay a little bit of interest over the long term in order to have good assets now. Hence, it's a good idea to go into a deficit to build infrastructure, which produces a return on investment in economic productivity, and balance the books once the economy gets going.   This idea that we should never spend into deficits is, frankly, pretty elementary.   Source: I have some background in economics. This is a basic concept we went over in first year. While my knowledge of economics is limited it was made very clear to me that deficits aren't necessarily bad."

Essentially ""in comparison"" to the PC budget the NDP plan spends more than it earns and uses the recovery in resource revenue to make up the gap. We never contribute to the heritage fund or save for a rainy day or make any significant paying down of debt either.  I had really hoped despite my local candidate being a dud that the NDP plan was atleast going to be tax as much as you want to spend, let the economy recover, and then pay off the debt and get the heritage fund growing. The have the heritage fund contribute back into general revenue some portion of it's investment growth in a year."
alberta,339dwm,mrmpr,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:39:39 2015 UTC,yeah i agree the whole thing was a bit too us vs them for my liking. that being said the PCs have been in power for 40 years and the NDP probably know that a lot of alberta voters vote to maintain the status quo. that's probably why they are trying to say that the status quo (read: PC) sucks.

alberta,3354lb,yesman_85,5,Mon Apr 20 20:28:07 2015 UTC,"At least as far as I am aware, there are no commercial gyrocopter schools in Western Canada. There are, it seems, only a handful of gyrocopters in all of Western Canada. You will need to find someone who can do private instruction if you can, mostly by word of mouth, and you may need to have your own gyrocopter (complete with all the headaches involved of registration and insurance and storage) Either way you will probably be doing a lot of travel. There are also commercial gyrocopter schools in Quebec and I think in Ontario too.  Is there any particular reason you've fixed on gyrocopters specifically? It's a very tiny niche in an already small aviation community.  Much more popular and accessible alternatives would be ultralight aircraft, light aircraft, helicopters, or gliders. They require much broader-category licenses (not a gyrocopter specific license) making them much easier to find and train for, and much more advantageous once you do, giving you an opportunity to fly many different kinds and types of aircraft.  A recreational pilot license for aircraft will allow you to pilot light and ultralight aircraft. A recreational pilot license for helicopters will do the same for helicopters. A glider license will let you fly gliders. They are all different and separate licenses and require separate training. There is also an ultralight specific license, but again you're getting into gyrocopter-license territory where I'm not sure anyone trains for it commercially and I don't know where to find someone who does ultralight-only training. The good news is that you don't need it, because a recreational license will allow you to fly ultralights as well and will teach you everything you need to know to do so safely -- the same is not true for gyrocopters, which fly very differently from all other types of aircraft and need their own specific type of license.  For recreational pilot licenses, you can head to Springbank Airport or High River Airport. Both have flight training schools for aircraft, I did my license at the Calgary Flying Club, and helicopter training is available at Springbank (not sure about HR). For gliding, get in touch with the Calgary Soaring Club, Cu-nim down in Black Diamond, they are great, and it's on my personal to-do list. All of these places will offer a discounted first flight known as a ""discovery flight"" or ""intro flight"" the purpose of which is to show you what to expect and give you a taste of how it feels, and also to go over the costs and requirements involved. In all cases this first flight will count towards your training if you choose to pursue it.  Flight is expensive. Be prepared. Licensing and training typically costs at least $5,000 for gliding, and at least $10,000 for airplane, and at least $20,000 for helicopter. You may have heard in some physics discussion somewhere that ""lift"" is what makes an airplane fly -- this is false. It is actually ""money"" that makes airplanes fly, and it takes a hell of a lot of money to get off the ground.  Also you should swing by /r/flying, or PM me privately if you have any questions."

I recently graduated from a Construction program at NAIT where they taught us how P3 ensures a quality product from the contractor as they have to service and maintain the building for up to 30 years. In terms when they are used on useful things like schools, it serves the purpose to help the government build more schools when it normally wouldn't fit into our budget and holds the contractor accountable for maintenance costs over the long term.

alberta,32v9vi,Kaelteth,6,Fri Apr 17 00:22:35 2015 UTC,Even a 2% increase to corporate tax would still place Alberta below the national average.  There are so many beneficial ways this money could be spent to help the province.
alberta,32v9vi,leto_wiggin,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:04:54 2015 UTC,I agree with raising corporate taxes and I fully support your position but I'm wondering where you're getting the 2% increase would still keep Alberta below the national average? Where does it say the national average for provincial corporate tax on that page you linked?
alberta,32v9vi,kang3157,2,Fri Apr 17 04:17:39 2015 UTC,".... Math.   Add up the rates given, divide by the number of provinces. For the General rate this gives you a national average of 12.6%. Alberta's rate currently sits at 10%... a 2% rise brings it to 12%... .6% below the national average."
alberta,32v9vi,housewife_hell,8,Fri Apr 17 04:27:24 2015 UTC,"I guess that's fair enough, although it feels kind of wrong weighing Ontario and PEI the same. I don't know if it's much of a meaningful average if there are 100 times more people paying 11.5% than 16% but they're given the same weight in the calculation. It feels like we're skewing the numbers :/"
alberta,32v9vi,kang3157,4,Fri Apr 17 04:32:16 2015 UTC,"But we're not talking individuals here, we're talking corporations. And a national average is just that, the averages of all provincial rates. The PC's are trying to tell you that they need to keep them low to ""remain competitive."" If a corporation is seriously looking to flee Alberta over a few percentage points, then their other options across Canada are not really going to save them much money, if at all. If a corporation is looking to leave Alberta for PEI over corporate taxes it doesn't matter at all how big the population is or how many other corporations are paying it. The rate is the rate. It's a perfectly fair comparison."
alberta,32v9vi,housewife_hell,2,Fri Apr 17 04:44:50 2015 UTC,"Like I've already said, I agree with you that Alberta has to raise its corporate tax and I am fully aware of how Prentice is trying to fool me.   But it's absurd to say that any large corporation is going to move its business to a place like PEI because the population just can't provide the number of skilled workers it would need. Which means even if the tax rate in PEI was -10%, large corporations wouldn't move there. My point is that a ""national average of provincial corporate tax"" is essentially a meaningless number because you're comparing apples to oranges.   My criticism isn't of your belief but of your methodology and skewing the numbers to try to make a point is something the PCs have done to us for far too long. We've got to be better than that."
alberta,32v9vi,kang3157,5,Fri Apr 17 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"But it's absurd to say that any large corporation is going to move its business to a place like PEI because the population just can't provide the number of skilled workers it would need.   It doesn't have to. To see this in action we need only look at Alberta itself. A very large percentage of the skilled workforce here are not Albertans. People will move to where the good work is. But that's not the point here, and that's not Prentice's argument.   What's absurd is the PC's telling us that taxes, and taxes alone, are enough to push/pull corporations and that's just not the truth, particularly not when we're haggling over less than 3%. Their argument has nothing to do with labour forces or anything else, they are trying to tell us that, with all other factors remaining the same,  a tax increase will scare away business. Full stop. In this case, the comparison of provincial rates is most certainly apples to apples.   That being said, your recognition of other factors that are far more important when businesses are looking at whether or not to relocate is absolutely spot on and is a major reason why this ""we can't raise taxes!"" cry holds no credibility.   Edit: cat hit enter too soon, finished thought."

You understand that there are far more important factors that go into these kinds of business decisions and that the PC's are trying to pull the wool over our eyes with unsubstantiated smoke-and-mirror numbers.   I understand why the provincial cross-comparison doesn't sit right with you, but I was attempting to show you why it's a fair comparison when dealing directly with the Prentice argument.   If you begin to factor in the nuances of varying business climates across the country - as you have - then it becomes very easy to see why a few percentage points one way or the other is not going to be enough to force a corporation to lay off workers in droves or relocate entirely - but it is that same nuanced analysis of the situation that is missing entirely from the Prentice argument, thus, to defeat his argument we need only look at the simplistic rate comparison. (ie: Even if rates are the single defining factor, we can still raise them and remain competitive).   After that we can go further and point out the many holes in the argument, as you have begun to do.   Keep talking about this, keep questioning the misinformation, we need this debate now more than ever."

alberta,32v9vi,mpobers,3,Fri Apr 17 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing any obvious correlation here.  Belgium has the highest corporate tax rate, and ranks about 20th on the OECD Employment rate list. France is right by it on both lists.  Iceland is at the top of the Employment Rate list but only has a 20% corporate tax.   Turkey also, with 20% tax is at the bottom of the Employment Rate list.  I don't think you can draw any conclusions one way or the other from that."
alberta,32v9vi,venuswasaflytrap,4,Fri Apr 17 11:04:32 2015 UTC,I think that's part of the point though. There is no correlation. So you can raise corp tax and it's not going to automatically impact employment.
alberta,32v9vi,JeffBoner,8,Fri Apr 17 13:09:09 2015 UTC,"No, that's not correct.   If you did a list of vehicles, and ranked by what their fuel economy was (km/100L) and another list ranked by their maximum range was on a full tank of gas, you might find that there is no obvious correlation between the 2 lists.   Obviously this is because the range is a combination of what their fuel economy is, and another variable - the size of their gas tank. So a car with great economy, but a tiny tank might have a very short range, and a huge truck with a huge tank and a reserve tank might have a huge range, despite having terrible economy.  But it would still be the case that all the vehicles maximum range would go down if we made their fuel economy worse, and go up if we made it better - i.e. there is a direct relationship between fuel economy and range assuming that the tank size remains consistent.  There are a lot variables that effect employment. It could be that Iceland has high employment despite a high corporate tax rate, due to other variables (culture, government spending etc.) and that if you lowered the tax rate, employment would go up. But the opposite could also be true - that other countries with low employment have low employment despite the high tax rate, and if you raised it, it would still go up.  And the relationship doesn't have to be linear! It could be if you raise tax rate a little bit, employment goes up, but if you raise it more, employment goes down again - there might be a sweet spot. This is the case with tax rate and tax revenue for instance. There might be multiple sweet spots, there might be plateaus.  And of course, there might be no relationship whatsoever between the two.  You can't easily make a conclusion one way or another without performing statistical analysis."

It postulates that no tax revenue will be raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% and that there must be at least one rate where tax revenue would be a non-zero maximum.

Now, of course, said corporation would be doing some analysis to determine the rate of return to moving their corporation to an area with a more favourable tax scheme if you were actually talking 80% difference.  But even at 1%, they'd still enjoy the most favourable tax rates in Canada.  At 2%, it wouldn't be the lowest anymore, but it would be close, and one would have to do the math to determine the amount of savings over an extended period vs the cost to move to another province, and whether that would be considered an option.  But seriously, so long as we're the lowest and/or extremely competitive in tax rates to other areas, 1-2% isn't going to make a fucking difference.  But you take it to some illogical stupid jump and try to show that the argument is flawed.  And even under your argument, if there's a profit, the jobs aren't going away, but likely to be moved because the tax scheme isn't competitive.  Do you see why your logic is bullshit?"

alberta,32v9vi,Kaelteth,4,Fri Apr 17 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"Here's a little hint for you...  There will be no cut to employment or wages.  Seriously, we're talking here that if you as a corporation once made a million dollars of profit a year, you now make 990,000 in profit in a year.  Firing someone might raise your profit back up...lets say he made $50,000 a year.  Now your profit is $1,040,000.  But you're now less mobile by 1 staff member...how tight are your human resources?  Can you afford to cut a staff and still make the same amount of goods, or provide the same service?  a 1% tax increase to corporations is meaningless to the individual corporation, but raises a billion dollars for the province.

I doubt you actually understand how much a teacher really does.  The average teacher puts in at LEAST 8-10 hours everyday and they put in a lot of time over weekends.  Most put in a good 50-60 hours every week or more.  Please go find us some examples of this 6 hour day for a teacher...that is in the class for the full day.

Their schooling is far less intense, and they do a whole lot less.   The teachers' unions have done their best to milk this province's taxpayers for all they're worth. Its embarrassing and anyone who campaigns otherwise has got a seriously swollen head."

Nurse pay in Alberta  An overall wage of $42.60/hour is what the average nurse makes in Alberta   Please note the AVERAGE working hours for a Nurse are only 28.8/week.  Elementary teacher pay in Alberta The Average teacher makes $42.98/hour in Alberta.  The average hours worked(and these are in school hours) are 34.8/week.  So there you go that is where the extra $13k/year comes in...they work more at the ""office"" then your average nurse does.  The Nurse does not take work home with them to do either.  Nurse do not get emails at home from their patients asking questions or the patients families emailing them asking for extra help.  You have no idea what goes into being a teacher.  The Teacher Unions have not milked the province at all, they have been fighting for better working conditions.    Yes pushing for smaller class sizes to improve student learning is such a horrible thing.  Let's just cram 40+ kids(with an avergae of 3-6 with mild to moderate special needs or behavior problems) in a room together with 1 adult and expect them all to learn well."
alberta,32v9vi,Dabookitty,9,Fri Apr 17 17:00:59 2015 UTC,Good math. Do you actually know a single teacher that works 830-330.  Your ignorance is shocking.

Right, and by every metric, the current government has continually failed to be able to do this with any success at all. Why on earth would you put any stock in their numbers just because it's in a larger font.   Honestly, the answer you seek is that there is ZERO evidence to support these job loss claims. None whatsoever. Even with a raised corporate tax, Alberta retains a competitive business advantage by being the only province with no sales tax and also not having a capitol or payroll tax. The notion that 2% raise in Corporate taxes (Note: this is NOT the same rate paid by small businesses) is going to shutter these large companies is pure fantasy.  Not to mention a not-insignificant portion of these companies have business interests that are geographically tied to the region thanks to the natural resource sector. It makes no sense for them to pack up and go elsewhere over what essentially amounts to a negligible tax increase. Fear mongering works best when people don't understand the nature of what's being discussed. How ""strongly they feel"" about it has nothing to do with how far removed it is from actual reality."

Based on what you've described, it sounds like they found an in situ melanoma with clear margins, but that would be good to clarify.

alberta,32tp4f,thedloan,4,Fri Apr 17 01:50:17 2015 UTC,You should at least have 1 seat to be in the debate.
alberta,32tp4f,cwmshy,8,Fri Apr 17 01:13:45 2015 UTC,Win a seat in the house then we'll talk
alberta,32tp4f,Ironhorn,4,Thu Apr 16 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"In the 2012 election they got about 1% of the vote more than the Communist Party, the Evergreen Party (now Green), Social Credit and the Separation Party. If the Alberta Party is going to be included they should be too."
alberta,32tp4f,cwmshy,5,Thu Apr 16 22:45:19 2015 UTC,They have no sitting members and they're only running 36 candidates in 87 seats. Fringe parties don't get a seat at the debate.
alberta,32tp4f,Ex_Officio15,2,Fri Apr 17 03:33:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's a party leader.  There's no good reason, provincially or federally, to exclude political party leaders from debates. Yes, even the small non-serious parties, as their presence is intended to add to the political discussion."
alberta,32tp4f,Ex_Officio15,12,Fri Apr 17 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"You realize that would be 18 leaders (edit: federally), right?  I'd love to see it, but it would be a mess, and no one would get any time to have a proper conversation."
alberta,32tp4f,Lakoustic,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't quite realize that, haha. But it would be nice to see more parties than just the 3-4 most popular."
alberta,32tp4f,Ex_Officio15,5,Thu Apr 16 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"Four is plenty. The more small parties there are, the less time the serious parties will have to take on Prentice.   The Republican Governor of Idaho took flak for allowing two fringe candidates into the debate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, because it gave the serious candidate less time to debate him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQlPcwiruaY"
alberta,32tp4f,Lakoustic,0,Thu Apr 16 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"no.... 9.   http://www.elections.ab.ca/public%20website/603.cfm  and i don't think anyone is saying that the Alberta First party, with 0 candidates should participate. So that makes 8.   8 leaders should be able to debate in a reasonably productive format, though you could certainly eliminate those with <3 candidates (SC and Commies)  The remaining parties would then be:  PC  Wildrose  NDP  Liberal  Alberta Party  Green Party  There is no justifiable reason why a debate should not include these 6 parties and their leaders, especially when each is capable of forming at least a minority government or possibly being a major part of any coalition. People deserve the chance to hear those who may represent them before going to the polls."
alberta,32tp4f,Ex_Officio15,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"The Communists have at least two candidates, why exclude them?"
alberta,32tp4f,TotesMessenger,2,Thu Apr 16 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"Because they cannot form a government or opposition with 2 candidates. Even if they win both of the seats they're vying for, another party will win 2+ seats mathematically.   The Alberta Party is running 30+ candidates. They have a mathematical shot at forming a minority government. The Communist Party does not."
alberta,32tp4f,keepcalmdude,3,Thu Apr 16 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"Because they cannot form a government or opposition with 2 candidates.   Theoretically, they could. Alberta has had one-seat oppositions before.    They have a mathematical shot at forming a minority government. The Communist Party does not.   Even for that to happen, the other 50 seats would have to split almost evenly between the other 4 parties"

alberta,32u1we,alpain,2,Fri Apr 17 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"Orange, along with blue, have been the PC's colours since at least 1971.  We're they in orange only? Was it the lighter, NDP shade if orange? Because that would be strange."

alberta,32u1we,alpain,0,Fri Apr 17 18:02:00 2015 UTC,Only really orange where it was orange before though. I don't think there's been much shift in traditionally PC areas
alberta,32u1we,xrendan,13,Thu Apr 16 20:55:28 2015 UTC,Edmonton for sure is orange
alberta,32u1we,Ex_Officio15,4,Fri Apr 17 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the ridings they barely won last time (Ed-Calder and Ed Bev Clairview) are absolutely plastered with signs. Ed-Decore, Ed-Gold Bar, and Ed-Manning (currently PC seats) are currently dominated by the NDP, too. I'd say the NDP is winning in Ed-Millwoods (though neither party has many signs up there yet) and it is competitive with the PCs in the Tory safe seat of Ed-Castle Downs.  I haven't been to any other ridings yet."
alberta,32u1we,AntonBanton,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:33:33 2015 UTC,I noticed a ton of PC signs on public property in Beverly and not as many NDP signs. But the NDP signs dominate on voters lawns. When I  talked to someone at the local campaign office I was told they don't have a lot on public property because they've barely been able to keep up with the requests to get them on people's lawns so they've been prioritizing those over public property. I haven't seen many PC signs on lawns either.
alberta,32u1we,Ex_Officio15,2,Fri Apr 17 05:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was talking about signs on private property only - those are the ones that show some indication of public support. Derron Bilous' Facebook page said they have over 1,800 signs up in his riding. From the looks of it,  most of them are on private property."
alberta,32u1we,swiftb3,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:19:26 2015 UTC,I appreciate Derron Bilous for not spamming public property.

alberta,32u1we,swiftb3,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:58:53 2015 UTC,"Our local NDP guy got people to put his signs in their yards.  Apparently the PC guy didn't have the support, so he just spammed the edge of roads that have public or ""Who-owns-this?"" properties."

However, they've been through a series of weak or unpopular premiers since King Ralph, and the veneer around the party is finally starting to chip away. Prentice didn't step up from civil politics (which is usually a safe bet), but stepped down from a high-profile Federal post, and he was not well-liked in his roles there.  At the same time, the NDP have been a competent, organized party of primarily intelligent people for quite a while. Honestly, Brian Mason did far more than the Liberals with far fewer resources.  And now we have Rachel Notley, who may be one of the best leaders the province has seen - in skill, saviness, and charisma.  If the NDP will ever break out in this province, this is the election for it. We have a weak PC party, a gutted Wildrose opposition, two fringe (for now) parties (Green and Alberta Party) to split the Liberal vote, and a strong NDP with a strong leader.  I'm doubtful, but it could happen."

alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,-18,Wed May 6 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"I heard an NDP statement on CBC radio this week that turned me off of the party.  They said something to the effect of, ""Something something working man.""    Really?  That tired old BS from Layton's playbook?  Who is this party talking to just the blue collar blokes that work ten to twelve hour days?  Not me, a guy that works from home harder than he ever did in the field as a scaffolder?    I don't fit the 'working man' mold anymore I guess so way to go, NDP.  I am successfully alienated.  Oh, and I'm also involved with a woman that has an office job lately...so we're well outside of the target audience I suppose.  I'm open to a conversation and could welcome change, but Brian Jean is a nutcase and the NDP doesn't speak to me...so the choices are narrowed."
alberta,32u1we,AntonBanton,23,Wed May 6 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"So because you don't work in a specific industry you don't think you're a working person? I think the problem is your narrow definition of what counts as work, not the NDP's comments."
alberta,32u1we,Igby8776,9,Fri Apr 17 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"Have to agree, this sounds more like your issue not the ndp's"

Historically, they pander to blue collar sentiment of being forgotten at the polls, as evidenced by the party leader rarely being seen without wearing a blue dress shirt with the sleeves rolled wayyyyyy up, to get serious work done."
alberta,32u1we,Ex_Officio15,7,Fri Apr 17 12:11:45 2015 UTC,"Working people generally means working class. Anyone who gets paid in salary or wages, as opposed to making money only from capital assets (real estate, stocks, and general ""economic rent"")."
alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,-3,Fri Apr 17 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"Ohhhhhhhhhh. :|   Well the PC's generally talk to the business owners which is evident by their frequent blurbs on corporate tax.  The WP goes after the libertarians and the LB's stand for the staunchest left wingers and nuzzle up to business now and then.  So...upon listening to the NDP for twenty five years now, their song is for the people that work the ""hardest, longest and get taxed the most.""  I've been in and out of the trades for about ten years and spoke as candidly as I am now to my peers then, and they always felt the NDP was their party.  I had hoped to be wooed by someone new this year but...so far, meh."
alberta,32u1we,enigmakahn,2,Fri Apr 17 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"My assumption Would be any ""man"" who is ""working"" so since i assume you still have to work for a living, they are most likely trying to talk to you. Unfortunately it wasn't the NDP who painted the ""working man"" as a rig pig or labourer, it was the PC in their mad dash to idolise the oil fields."
alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,5,Sat Apr 18 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'm seriously not trying to be argumentative, but how would you like to be addressed if not as a person who works? Some alternatives: 1. person who worked to build the province, 2. entrepreneur, 3. tradesperson, 4. academic, 5. ???  It must be difficult to parse terminology."
alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,0,Fri Apr 17 16:08:54 2015 UTC,"Me neither...I'm really not upset or angry but it's hard to get that from some typy typins here.   Fine question and that got me thinking about it deeper.  I appreciate that.  Thing is, is I wanted to be more open this time around and hear from other parties but that terminology just smacked of Jack Layton's platform and I never thought he was good for the job.  I could never picture him as Canada's CEO...so I guess I'm still jaundiced by that."
alberta,32u1we,snakeob,3,Fri Apr 17 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"I don't live in Alberta so I don't have a role in this fight. I am interested in politics so am selfishly interested in your response. How would someone like you like to be addressed. Sorry to view you as a test subject, lol. Best wishes in your decision making process.  Full disclosure: When I was a kid I got my news from Lloydminster and was impressed with Grant Notley until he tragically died in a plane crash. So I am surprisingly happy to see his daughter, Rachel, doing so well."
alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,0,Sat Apr 18 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"As a voter. The risk taken during classification is alienation.    This whole thing started because a party tried to speak to someone specifically and by the terms they used, I didn't feel they wanted to talk to me.  I know some people here feel I'm being pedantic or just plain belligerent but I have paid attention to the subtleties of each election since before I could vote.

alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,1 point,Thu May 7 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking that.  I was listening to Mr. Prentice's address that day on the CBC and I knew that would be an incendiary comment the moment he said it.  I'm sure he did too.  Thing is...is he's right.  He came from HQ out east and parachuted into a mess.  So I think what he really meant was, ""Alberta, you've been voting for the people that brought you all the way here so if you want to blame someone, look in the mirror at the person that hired that Party.""  I don't think he really meant it as, ""Alberta...you fucked up by spending money and being people and working hard in life.""  That's the way it's been spun."

Repeatedly. And none of them thought enough of it to speak up and point out what a toxic and unproductive attitude that is. That told me all I needed to know about the Wildrose.   As for the NDP's working man reference... Unless you're the CEO, CFO, or COO you probably still fit the colloquial definition if ""working man"", it's basically a catch-all for the middle class. No need to get in a huff over that!"
alberta,32u1we,tedcorp,2,Sat Apr 18 01:04:23 2015 UTC,"Well put.  Thank you for the balanced reply.  I said, I was open to the conversation this election and you're right about Brian...he's already turned me off.  Thing is, is if the WP wins we'll effectively have an Alberta Bloq Quebecois.

That scares me. They are far too socially conservative and I personally don't think there's a principled soul amongst the whole lot of them. They were official opposition and could not hold onto their own convictions long enough to wait for this election. First promise of money and power and they literally could not cross the floor fast enough. I don't trust them not to screw us all if it would benefit them. They refuse to consider anything with the word 'tax' in it, even if has been shown to be sound policy, and they would be too easily bought by big money interests.

I've said for years that candidates like this neglect to admit how dirty their hands get during vigorous mud slinging.  I listen to CBC radio with passion around times like this as well and what's truly missing from every cut and jibe from official oppositions here and in Ottawa, especially today, are actual solutions or fundable programs in lieu of the programs the PC's are proposing.

alberta,32u1we,meredithgillis,7,Thu Apr 16 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"its more likely we'll see an WR run government than NDP.   Yup. A big reason for this is that Alberta has the most malapportioned electoral districts in the country(i.e. way too many rural seats, not enough urban ones)."

Overall it seems pretty decently even. Spruce Grove is the most underrepresented (51,800) while Dunvegan-Central Peace Notley is the most overrepresented (23,000).   By eye, it does seem that rural districts are more represented, but I'm not sure by how much. If I have time later, maybe I'll try and figure it out."

There are 87 electoral districts, 25 in calgary, 19 in edmonton which equals 44 and just over half. Which makes sense since half of Alberta's 4 million people live in Calgary and Edmonton and the other half are rural."
alberta,32u1we,bretters_at_work,2,Thu Apr 16 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"This. Everyone always moans and groans about how urban/rural are over/under represented but it's actually pretty sensible. What doesn't necessarily make sense is where the lines for the rural ridings are drawn. Issue is not the number of rural ridings, it's throwing communities that don't actually have non-electoral ties to each other together in a riding and asking someone to represent everyone there."

alberta,32u1we,Ex_Officio15,4,Fri Apr 17 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"That seems to me more like Swann didn't want the rurals represented because the Liberals have no support there. This is also 2010, the rural populations are no longer dropping and have evened out to match the cities. There will always be differences in riding sizes due to population densities. but suggesting that half of alberta's population shouldn't be represented by half of the legislature is ridiculous."
alberta,32u1we,Ex_Officio15,10,Mon May 4 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"I think urban politics have been steadily shifting progressive left as evidenced by how Iveson and Nenshi marketed themselves.  I think the Conservatives won the last election because the left would rather the devil they know, than the Wild Rose.  Now the PCs are still paying penance for feathers ruffled by Prentice's look in the mirror speech.  It doesn't seem like much, but Alberta politics are pretty uneventful so people remember if you push the wrong buttons.    If the election were tomorrow, the PC and NDP would split the vote and Wild Rose would take the minority.  Personally I haven't even really heard any of the candidates speak, so a lot can change after the debates.    If I was the NDP, I'd be kissing babies and smiling but trying to make as few waves as possible.  Let the social crazy keep leaking out of the Wild Rose, and cross my fingers that Prentice will tell Albertans those jeans make them look fat.  That might already be their A-game, as someone already pointed out the other day, their platform page literally (not literally) 404s."

The broader 'wildrose' search should stay pretty consistent throughout the year, so that should be negligible in regards to trends. And the NDP spikes you can use logic to see which ones are provincial and which ones are Federal.  The polling indicates wildrose is stabilizing, which you also see in the Google trends. NDP is significantly rising (again seen both in polling and trends). Here's another interesting one that includes leaders as well.  I'm more interested to see how/if these trends change over the next few weeks. Whether anything comes out of it - who knows. But it's interesting."

alberta,32n4se,swordgeek,6,Wed Apr 15 04:35:04 2015 UTC,Wildrose started out as basically a splinter group of the extreme right-wing members of the PCs who felt that the PC party wasn't nearly socially conservative or moral enough.
alberta,32n4se,Ex_Officio15,2,Wed Apr 15 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sucks. If not Christian Heritage, they probably would be the most socially conservative of all the political parties in the country."

For the common person (myself at least), it's too much of a time investment - and frustrating! -  to try to find and follow the actual releases and wade through the non-stances and fluff that they push out between just firing shots at each other.  I can make guesses to my alignment, but as this quiz pointed out for me, my guesses can be way off.  At the end of the quiz you can also find great breakdowns, and links to more information as a great jumping off point to become more informed.  If every Albertan took this quiz I'm sure there would be a lot of surprised would-be-voters -- to many of us adopt our party alignment from our family and peers, news sources that lean one way or another, or from slanderous remarks made by the other parties.  It's such a breath of fresh air to just be able to see their stances on the actual issues while also having to think about YOUR OWN stance on the issue as well.  If everyone actually voted in line with their beliefs (add in some multipliers for party and leadership competency too), at least we'd have a real democracy - no one could complain that the opposing party won because the majority of Albertan's, who this time were actually educated on the issues and their alignment, voted for that party!  It's amazing how fresh and correct a working democracy could feel.  At the time of writing this comment, only ~61k out of ~2.5million eligible Albertan voters have taken this.  We need to share and get this out way wider."

I've never liked Swann as a leader and Sherman wasn't any better.   I've always felt the Alberta Party is the party of good intentions.

The Layton NDP released their entire platform on the first plane ride in one election to the press. That was a major mistake. What they should have done, and what good campaigns do, is release their platform piece by piece, making news every day.   The WRP are still picking up pieces of their party from the Great Floorcrossing, and doing a good job of it. The Libs are just not an organized political party at this point. The ABP... well... they dont really have policy, aside from doing ""whatever works best"".   Im really loving the picture of Alberta that the NDP are painting. Its not always raining here, the sky is not always falling, and its not always doom and gloom.

The bill died on the order paper when the 39th Parliament was dissolved prematurely and an election was called on September 7, 2008.  The Conservative Party of Canada promised in its 2008 election platform to re-introduce a bill containing the content of C-61 if re-elected.   The bill was the successor to the previously proposed Bill C-60. Specifically, the Conservative government claimed that the bill was intended to meet Canada's WIPO treaty obligations. Bill C-61 attracted widespread criticism from critics who claimed that it did not strike a fair balance between the rights of copyright holders and consumers.  There was also confusion between C-61 and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement which also had significant copyright implications for Canada.  Jim Prentice claimed that it would ""expressly allow you to record TV shows for later viewing; copy legally purchased music onto other devices, such as MP3 players or cell phones; make back-up copies of legally purchased books, newspapers, videocassettes and photographs onto devices you own"".  However, the bill would have made it illegal to circumvent DRM technologies effectively rendering the rights granted useless for DRM protected digital media.

alberta,32i08o,swordgeek,10,Tue Apr 14 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"Copyright Modernization Act passed in 2012 requires ISPs (e.g. Telus) to pass copyright infringement notice by copyright holders to alleged offenders. The copyright holder provides IP address and the notice to ISP, ISP checks its log to find the user who was assigned with the IP address, then ISP forwards the notice to the user. ISPs are required to pass the notice without modification, so they cannot do anything about providing false information with law and asking for money.  The copyright trollers can send unlimited request to users without any cost and target vulnerables (not so aware of the circumstance) with legal threat. The act allows the government of to set a fee, but the current government chose not to. The act also does not restrict the notice content except for the minimum requirements, it offers no protection against false/misleading/threatening information or settlement limit.  There are many other horrible provisions in this act but it doesn't affect normal users too much.  This act was proposed by then Industry Minister, now our Premier, Jim Prentice."

Social Liberalism? Are you nuts, this is the most socially conservative party in Canada. They had half their party walk away because they wouldn't concede to being more mainstream in their social policy. They have staunch opposition in the party to both ethnic minorities and LGBT communities.   I love the idea of have corporations carry more of their weight in taxation (we could still be the lowest in Canada) and I love the idea of balancing the budget even if it hurts and pouring surpluses into the heritage fund once the deficit is paid off.   But....a party that can't outright support Muslims/Gays/non-WASPs is scary. A politician will say anything to get elected but if these guys won't even lie about supporting these groups tells me they have some serious hate for some of these minorities.  I know it is cliche at this point but a Hitler reference doesn't seem too big a stretch. He had great economic policies and no one really cared that  he hated some groups, a lot of people did and just didn't vocalize it.  There clearly won't be a genocide in Alberta but I fear the openness of minorities will erode under the wildrose.   The wildrose are just another shade of conservative in Alberta and that is fine, most Albertans are conservative, but they represent the most socially conservative of the conservatives and that scares me.

The only thing I couldnt' find out was if you signed up for the ""Do Not Call"" list; are you still considered a poll-able number to be dialed?   POLLING METHODS   Telephone  The gold standard, live telephone polls are expensive, because interviewers must be trained and retained. One-third of Canadians have abandoned land lines and many are wary of answering cellphone calls from numbers they do not recognize. As a result, response rates have plummeted and these polls are thought to skew toward elderly and rural Canadians more likely to have land lines.  Online  A panel of volunteer respondents is assembled by the polling company and limited to people who use the Internet. Panellists are offered small financial incentives. The Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, the industry watchdog, warned that online poll results may be skewed and the method does not provide a random sampling. The MRIA prohibits reporting a margin of error for these polls.  Interactive Voice Response  Telephone calls are automated and phone numbers chosen from a database. Most IVR polling is land line only, though some companies attempt to reach cellphone users. Respondents enter answers to recorded questions by pressing buttons on their phone keypad. The IVR software prompts respondents to answer questions and will offer automated assistance. Critics contend these polls skew toward people angry at the incumbent ruling party.  -Edit- Sauce: http://www.edmontonjournal.com/opinion+polls+have+value/10957659/story.html"

The unions are needed more than ever, and they need more strength, since employers are now taking a much bigger piece of the pie and we've now seen ""trickle down"" means nothing more than ""piss on"".

It would be interesting to see how the oil industry arranged for her to lose office and be discredited, too. But realistically, all we're doing is amusing ourselves until the PCs triumph once again and then go after public sector unions like a vengeful demon.

At least the campaign worker who occasionally spams the sub posts actual news articles (for the most part).

Opponents of Big Business would (and have) complain that democracy was being subverted by the rich. It will be interesting to see if the law is modified before the next election. It would be nice if there was some sort of all-party forum or working group formed to create a regulation everybody could live with. At the very least if all the parties besides the PCs came forward with a unified proposal it would help.

Making a too-wide turn is also an infraction. Doing both at once is worth both.  In your example, hypothetically, whoever's marking would mark 'too fast for conditions' if you were just speeding, 'lack of control' if you were going too fast to take the turn safely (even if that's under the speed limit), and 'lack of awareness' if you cut someone off or had to dodge a pedestrian, and then you'd get multiple if more than one of those things happened.

Given a bit more thought I think the updated party stances page would be a good start if the headers were decreased. Maybe put the party icon on the left side under the subject heading (Environment, O&G) with a the first point from the parties platform on the subject with a read-more link that expands it? Just throwing out ideas in response to your question.  I just took a peak at the source code. Have you heard of http://getbootstrap.com/ or http://foundation.zurb.com/? They are UI frameworks that contain a bunch of CSS and JS that are ideally suited to building a web page like this. They are also responsive so working on different screen sizes works well too. Using tables for non-table data isn't that popular anymore :)."

Are they really a few weeks into an election and haven't ever stated their direct stance on Education?  On Healthcare?  No wonder people don't really know what each party stands for, which promotes HUGE voter apathy.    You can get ideology alignment through the voter compass quiz but I need to see those direct single-line statements of actual substance from the main parties ASAP.
