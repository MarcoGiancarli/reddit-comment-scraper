The lens is a Canon 16-35 F4/L IS.

What people refer to as heat lightning is usually just lightning from thunderstorms that is too far away to hear the thunder as you can see flashes from lightning up to ~100 miles away but the thunder often only travels less than ~30 miles.    In this picture I am sure you would have heard the thunder.

WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,unwinding,-1,Sat Jun 20 03:00:59 2015 UTC,So is your tact.
WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,tnick771,-2,Sat Jun 20 04:41:35 2015 UTC,99% sure it's not HDR but post processing. I love when non-photographers use photography lingo because their camera phone has a button with that acronym.
WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,unwinding,0,Sun Jun 21 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"Hdr is a common term for this kind of post processing nowadays. Also commonly called ""clarity"" as that is what it is called in lightroom. The lingo about this is confusing, i see how it could be confused with combining photos at multiple exposure levels, also called hdr traditionally."
WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,unwinding,2,Sun Jun 21 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure of what you're saying. I don't know what ""clarity"" is. The HDR itself was mostly to compress the highs so that the area in the lower left wouldn't be blown out. I did do some major noise reduction because this was a single-shot RAW. I am interested in your critique though. Could you better articulate your objection to my photo?"
WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,unwinding,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:36:49 2015 UTC,"My only objection is that your use of hdr is really strong, I took one look at the photo and knew that it had been edited. An average viewer probably wouldn't have this reaction but I spend an inordinate amount of time editing photos of clouds."
WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,tnick771,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"""Clarity"" is an effect in adobe lightroom that I believe is similar or the same as the hdr effect that you are using, but I'm not sure anymore after tnick771's fury about this."
WeatherPorn,3aaoc4,unwinding,-2,Tue Jun 23 07:09:25 2015 UTC,"Not true because Lightroom has an HDR feature in its newest release along with clarity.   E: Just for your sake, a little background on what High Dynamic Range (HDR) is. HDR takes a composite of 3 images: one under exposed, one at normal exposure, and one over exposed. This is an example of what goes into it. Hence why if you have your phone camera on HDR and you try capturing motion photography you often end up with ghosting or blurs - that is because your subject moved between one of those three photos.  The clarity slider finds the edges and enhances the contrast between the two colors that create that edge. It creates a lot of noise and could be why you are confusing it with HDR."

I get what you mean about the ""fake"" look of the photo. It's weird looking because it doesn't look all that stormy, I think. The sky in the background is blue and everything is pretty bright since this was on the very edge of the cell. The colors almost look too crisp, too. Maybe there's some sort of filter?"
WeatherPorn,38m9gr,King_Space,2,Fri Jun 5 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"Can't blame you for not claiming Broomfield as your own :P  I think you're right - good call. It's most likely HDR that makes it look that way, along with a good deal of over-editing."
WeatherPorn,38m9gr,aatencio91,3,Fri Jun 5 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"Actually I usually do claim Broomfield as my own. My Great-grandparents were one of the first families to move there and now my family has been there for four generations. My youngest sister just finished her last year at Emerald Elementary School and the school gave my family a special recognition for having four generations involved in the school (Great Grandpa was a teacher and the principal, Grandma went to school there, Mom went to school there, and me and my siblings went to school there). I usually just say I live ""near Boulder"" because no one outside of the area knows what the hell Broomfield is."
WeatherPorn,38m9gr,King_Space,2,Fri Jun 5 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"My brain was doing the same thing. I think it's because the funnel is nearly perfectly perpendicular to the ground, and the fact that it's width is virtually the same at the top and base."

WeatherPorn,38m9gr,UsagiMimi,2,Fri Jun 5 13:24:17 2015 UTC,I am a chaser also and I lived in California for a few years and Id have to agree. Tornadoes give me no problems but earthquakes always scared me.
WeatherPorn,38m9gr,__Garrett__,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"I've never experienced an earthquake, even after many trips to California, but it's always that thought that it'll hit when I'm in the worst possible place (those double-decker highway photos are etched in my brain, lol).

WeatherPorn,34euae,EMTWoods,2,Thu Apr 30 17:03:25 2015 UTC,We've had a few good weather events in the past couple of years. This one sticks out most in my mind.   I miss being in the area.
WeatherPorn,34euae,EMTWoods,2,Thu Apr 30 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"The derecho was a totally surreal event to experience. I stood outside of my apartment (pretty much where I was standing when I took this picture) and watched for several hours. The creepiest part was the constant lightning with no thunder mixed with the constant howl of the wind.  I also think of the tornado outbreak about this time 4 years ago, as well as a tornado warning in early July last year. Since stuff like that isn't near as common as, say, in the Midwest, I always enjoy when we get an exceptional storm!"
WeatherPorn,34euae,williampum98,2,Thu Apr 30 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"I was actually a firefighter who spent most of the derecho outside. By far the most intense night of my life. I don't think anything will every compare.   Although I'm from Virginia, I'm back in the Midwest for a spell. As a firefighter here, I get to go out and weather spot. Warnings are always an interesting time. Kind of glad we don't see much of that in VA though. I sleep a little better there."
WeatherPorn,34euae,williampum98,2,Fri May 1 03:03:37 2015 UTC,Is this the storm that flooded Bridgeforth Stadium?
WeatherPorn,34euae,EMTWoods,2,Fri May 1 09:55:15 2015 UTC,"That one was actually a couple weeks later. The derecho was June 29. The storm that flooded Bridgeforth Stadium was a couple weeks later on July 14th. I remember because I was doing Richmond's 48 Hour Film Festival, and our team, being based out of Harrisonburg, shot mostly in Harrisonburg...downtown...which flooded very quickly from that storm. Then I saw the pictures of the stadium. That was a very stormy summer!"

WeatherPorn,34936f,fantorangene,2,Wed Apr 29 07:20:16 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous.   I remember seeing a lightning storm pass through Las Vegas in, say, 2002? (Any natives, it was before the beltway was completed.)  It was evening and there wasn't much rain in the valley, but nonstop lightning everywhere. I drove out of town a ways (to Charleston and the Beltway..again, it wasn't even paved then) and sat for two hours watching the lightning erupt all over town.  Being 2002, it predated the ubiquitousness of digital cameras. I had a shitty disposable cardboard Rite-Aid film camera but the snaps were, predictably, shitty and have not survived. So the only record is in my mind.   Goddamn tragedy, because it was beautiful."
WeatherPorn,34936f,dziban303,2,Wed Apr 29 10:01:15 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome! Having the ability to experience a lightning storm at a distance is great! I was camping at a lake and was just lucky to watch the storm pass by me.  And as you say, now days it's much easier to capture lightning on camera. Setting the camera on a tripod and 20 sec. exposure time and you can let the camera do all the work. That being said I personally need software programs to bring out some of the light and colors. (As you can tell this photo is heavily edited)   Thanks for the comment."

WeatherPorn,31ioye,bigmeat,5,Sun Apr 5 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"I watched a lot of tornado videos when I was a kid, and I noticed that the tornadoes in places like Colorado and Wyoming had a different look to them, usually like this: a slender, tubular, dust-colored vortex with a cone at the top. I wonder if there's a meteorological reason for that, or if it's just a coincidence."
WeatherPorn,31ioye,hobosullivan,10,Sun Apr 5 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"The high plains tend to have landspouts which are a type of tornado that tend to be a bit weaker than tornadoes found in places like Kansas and Oklahoma. Typically, lanspouts are found on thunderstorms without mesocyclones which are rotations in supercells that can be 10s of kilometers wide. The lack of this large circulation generally means that the tornadoes are weaker.   Colorado specifically has an area called the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone that lies east of Denver where a lot of landspouts occur due to colliding air causing circulation and rotation.  Finally, Colorado and Wyoming are less moist than the other tornado prone states and that means that the cloud bases for severe storms are higher.  All these factors come together to make the tornadoes on the high plains look more tubular and picturesque.

WeatherPorn,31ioye,joi1369,3,Mon Apr 6 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"Landspout! That's the word for those! I remember hearing that in one of my tornado VHSs from the '90s.

WeatherPorn,2u922u,Guyot11,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"Wow that is an awesome pic! I did follow the storm north after the wall cloud stopped rotating. This was my first chase though, and I had a tough choice to make for road options. I could've tried to core punch to get back ahead of it or go several miles east before the next north option.   I chose the core punch and i had no visibility whatsoever. I let the storm pass and was overjoyed with the experience.   That really is interesting there is a chance we were on the same storm.

Nice rope tornado, didn't do much though. That storm started to die and there was another storm south of York that was going good, so we hightailed it over there and followed that north where you saw it. Then it dropped the tornado I posted and then started to look like it was dying so we went home."

During 2004 in Kansas, storm chaser Eric Nguyen photographed this budding twister in a different light -- the light of a rainbow. Featured here, a white tornado cloud descends from a dark storm cloud. The Sun, peeking through a clear patch of sky to the left, illuminates some buildings in the foreground. Sunlight reflects off raindrops to form a rainbow. By coincidence, the tornadoappears to end right over the rainbow. Streaks in the image are hail being swept about by the high swirling winds. Over 1,000 tornadoes, the most violent type of storm known, occur onEarth every year, many in tornado alley. If you see a tornado while driving, do not try to outrun it -- park your car safely, go to a storm cellar, or crouch under steps in a basement."

I spotted some from the tram (only had a short time that day, so I couldn't really hike in the forest), but the crash was in 1955, so a lot of them are grown up in trees and brush.  On the way up, the view was impeded by a gaggle of yammering old ladies, which was both adorable and frustrating."

WeatherPorn,2faf30,lordicarus,1 point,Wed Sep 3 03:38:23 2014 UTC,"Probably the result of how the camera takes the picture. In the brief second of taking the photo, it quickly scans up or down instead of taking the whole picture at once, and the exposure time changed for each of these brief shots resulting in one half looking darker than the other."
WeatherPorn,2faf30,monstaro,1 point,Wed Sep 3 07:22:19 2014 UTC,"I honestly don't know either. I took the picture with my Samsung Galaxy S3.

I used a shutter release on bulb mode, for as long as I felt was necessary (anything longer than a minute shooting at F10, at 200ISO). Once the shutter is released, it's just a matter of waiting for the strike. The light is so bright it will easily show up on your sensor.  Would you be using an SLR or a compact?"

Maybe I'm incorrect, but the parent storm doesn't look like a tornadic cell, and that doesn't look like any wall cloud I've ever seen.  OP, do you have any info on this image and/or the storm?"
WeatherPorn,27xjn1,GonzoStrangelove,4,Thu Jun 12 03:59:54 2014 UTC,"There's others who have video of the same tornado, so I'm not worried by you suggesting it's fake.

WeatherPorn,27xjn1,kyleisthestig,2,Thu Jun 12 16:36:30 2014 UTC,"I agree it definitely does not look like any wall cloud I've ever seen either. My guess is that it was a hot new Mexico day and the with was a blowing. It was a recipe for dust devils, the cooler air rushing from the cloud and the heated air from free new Mexico sand made a dust devil that was abnormally high and it touched the cloud?  But then that's way too big for a dust devil. Maybe it's like a weak tornado, like a water spout?   In my earth science class I did read that not all tornadoes form on wall clouds. Rather it's something like 99.99%. And it does look like this parent cell could be bigger than you'd expect, due to the clouds under the cell. I can't remember what those are called though.  This just turned into me rambling I'm sorry."

It looks to me like that light is shining up onto the clouds, not down through them.  Other than that, it's possible the sun is setting on the other side of the storm. Looking at the far left of the image, it does kind of look that way, with the pink in the clouds."

WeatherPorn,21bquh,fredwasmer,2,Tue Mar 25 15:03:08 2014 UTC,"Amazing photos. I'd like to share a story that these remind me of.  When I was a kid I was a huge meteorology nerd. Once during a stormy spring day we got a phone call from a neighbor nearby. She was telling us a funnel cloud was headed right for us. Guess what I did. Go on, guess what a dumb, nerdy kid like me did.  I ran outside to see it.  Out the front door I went and around the corner of the house to the south side. Just as I get there, right above my head is the funnel cloud. It kept going back and forth between looking like frame 1 and frame 5 in the pictures, so I knew it was unstable, but seeing it was INCREDIBLE.  It quickly made its way over my head going northeast, and as it got to the field just past mine and my neighbor's house, it made touchdown for not even a minute. I ran inside to get the binoculars, and by the time I ran back out, it completely dissipated.  I got to watch a tornado pass literally over my head, touchdown, and die without anyone getting hurt or anything being damaged. It was a fantastic day."
WeatherPorn,21bquh,ashleton,3,Tue Mar 25 17:44:44 2014 UTC,"It seems that we think alike.  Tornado coming, so ... run outside to watch. :)  Actually, I wish I'd been able to appreciate bad weather when I was young.  As a kid, I was terrified of storms; I headed straight to the basement if I so much as heard thunder.  It's only in my late teens that I started loving severe weather.  Do you ever consider storm chasing?  Sounds like you might enjoy it.  There are tours you can join if you didn't feel comfortable doing it yourself."

Here are the coordinates where I took the photo: 45.32311,13.559639 (paste in google maps) Exposure Time: 20 FNumber: 6,3 Focal Length: 17 ISO Speed Ratings: 640  The storm lasted for a hour and a half. I was shooting it about a hour, because it moved and I had to move to another location. At first I was nice because the storm was far away. But after I moved, it became really scary. The storm was on top of me ( http://imgur.com/L545fV7 ). A couple of times my hair stood up."

WeatherPorn,1wdxw3,luchid0r,3,Tue Jan 28 18:02:48 2014 UTC,I live in the desert and have no clue how hurricanes operate so bear with me if these are dumb questions. What do wind speeds get to in a hurricane? How close can hurricanes get to the shore? Does it pull water into its vortex? How deep of water is a hurricane? What is the water like underneath a hurricane?

WeatherPorn,1wdxw3,awesomejohnson,1 point,Wed Jan 29 07:31:57 2014 UTC,"Great writeup!  Also, OP, there are tons of great accounts of notable cyclones and their effects on the areas they impacted on Wikipedia. Pick a storm that comes to mind easily and read it's article. It will reinforce what /u/OshawaConnection has explained and go into deeper detail.  For bonus points, follow up your Wikipedia reading with YouTube vids of the same storm. The more recent the storm, the more footage you'll find."
WeatherPorn,1wdxw3,awesomejohnson,1 point,Wed Jan 29 16:04:44 2014 UTC,"They can get over 300 km an hour, and they can go on land, no water gets sucked up that would be when a water twister or water spout forms over a body of water so again no water other than large amounts of rain come from a hurricane. The water can be bad causing floods in homes and even in streets. Its not a very fun thing to be in and thankfully wear I live!"
WeatherPorn,1wdxw3,OshawaConnection,2,Wed Jan 29 16:04:23 2014 UTC,"Fun fact, waterspouts don't actually suck up any water from the ocean either.  It's all atmospheric water vapor."

WeatherPorn,1vvj9d,liddicoatite,2,Thu Jan 23 00:43:12 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen it often. Someone called it a bowtie vortex, another called it a horizontal roll vortex, not sure if there is a common term for it..."
WeatherPorn,1vvj9d,Guyot11,1 point,Thu Jan 23 01:19:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they have a variety of names. I wouldn't say they are common, but I wouldn't say they are rare either. When tornadoes form they start out as a horizontal roll but are tilted upward by the updraft. But sometimes the upward motion of a tornado creates a horizontal roll near the side of the tornado. Also since there is just so much rotation around the wall cloud, a horizontal roll can occur. You can see it in this video on the left side. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_QRG-TsfBc"
WeatherPorn,1vvj9d,Guyot11,1 point,Thu Jan 23 16:44:14 2014 UTC,"Yes I have seen horizontal vorticies before, but not usually so detached from the main tornado. Side note, the tornado here was initially horizontal before being tilted and streched to the surface, and before this tornado there was a seperate funnel with several co-rotating vorticies. This day provided a great display of vortex dynmamics."

When it arrived it completely enveloped us, in the middle of the dust storm it began to rain which made it seem like it was raining mud for a few minutes. The temperature dropped probably 5-10 degrees from the 120ish high it was that day. The storm was only about 500 meters away from us at that point. It reached us in under a minute after this picture.
