Cumberbitches,3dsmvt,daleygaga,7,Sun Jul 19 01:49:49 2015 UTC,This one is what sent me down this rabbit hole.  This one makes me hyperventilate.  And this one is one of the recent photos that sets my loins on fire.
Cumberbitches,3dsmvt,MrsSaffronReynolds,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:52 2015 UTC,you chose wisely :-)))
Cumberbitches,3dsmvt,buggy78,8,Sun Jul 19 20:11:55 2015 UTC,Yay happy birthday Ben!!!  Hmmm....how about this one?  Oh who am I kidding.  I can't pick just one.
Cumberbitches,3dsmvt,costlyideas,17,Sun Jul 19 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"before i go into this proper, let us be clear that for every single pic that has ever surfaced of this man there is something in each for everyone because this man is basically a perfect specimen whose features and personality are the ultimate combination of masculinity, beauty and character. this in turn means that every single 'bitch here has a horde of hundreds if not thousands of pics somewhere on their phone and/or every other device that holds hundreds of photographs and gifs that are labelled ""Dreamboat"" (for the romantic) or ""FuckFest"" (for the more honest) or ""Random"" (for those who need a way to divert attention away from the folder), all because there is no way to pick one.  but like /u/daleygaga, for me, the Vanity Fair one engages all my organs from my brain to my loins because of the simple sincerity of his smile and look. there is a sweetness in his gaze that connects, a complicity that immediately diminishes the distance between the onlooker and the subject. if you are as obsessive meticulous as the standard 'bitch, you will know this is the most sought after eye contact of all, the one that not only says ""come here"" but also ""i know"" and ultimately, ""i'm yours"".  disclaimer: i'm a 'bitch so i have a lot of imagination.  HAPPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY YOU SEXY MOTHERFUCKER I HATE YOU LOVE YOU HATE YOU LOVE YOU"

Cumberbitches,3binl8,eeclaren,7,Tue Jun 30 02:19:44 2015 UTC,I'm lost too. How is the title spoiler-y? All it says is talking about the Ant-Man movie also brings up Dr. Strange.
Cumberbitches,3binl8,mishkatashakishka,5,Tue Jun 30 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm don't see any rules broken, since Feige just talked about Dr. Strange while doing promo for Ant-Man. Certainly no spoilers in the title. :)"
Cumberbitches,3binl8,NauticalxDisaster,3,Tue Jun 30 03:55:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, not a spoiler at all unless its the part where you mentioned that Dr. Strange was talked about during Ant Man publicity.  Like...they wanted to check out the publicity and find out that Dr. Strange was mentioned themselves?  No idea."
Cumberbitches,3b9us4,daleygaga,3,Sat Jun 27 04:13:34 2015 UTC,LMAO at news networks saying that this is an attempt to add diversity to AMPAS.
Cumberbitches,3b9us4,mishkatashakishka,2,Sat Jun 27 05:15:35 2015 UTC,"I am quite happy about the inclusion of so many Brits. Hopefully, it will be followed by a massive influx of British television shows airing in more visible timeslots/networks here in the states."
Cumberbitches,3b9us4,RavenclawHouseRules,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:08:09 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few Brits on that list. Not that I don't think they deserve to be there, but the Academy will no longer be known as the ""America"" Academy. Perhaps the Anglophone Academy?"

Cumberbitches,3b6i6n,eeyore102,2,Fri Jun 26 14:37:41 2015 UTC,Cheers
Cumberbitches,3b6i6n,TimeFlies89,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:17:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for making me remember that I need to get rum. I have the rest of the ingredients for a pina colada...except the booze. And one of those sounds FANTASTIC right now because it is so damn hot outside.

Cumberbitches,3b6i6n,TimeFlies89,2,Sat Jun 27 11:29:13 2015 UTC,Yes to the look in his eyes and the suit! I'm all his...
