sunsetshimmer,3dcxqg,FringePioneer,5,Wed Jul 15 08:03:47 2015 UTC,Implication?  I know the quote is from before Sunset reenters the mirror after human Fluttershy takes the crown and I know she uses the sledgehammer to threaten to break the portal late in the movie.  I hadn't thought of anything beyond that.  Did you intend some implication?  Is she about to murder Twilight with a sledgehammer?

Unfortunately, I do not recall the title or the author.  What I do recall is that I read it on FIMFiction before I had an account and, relevantly, the following synopsis.  While Sunset is at Canterlot High, Vice Prinicpal Luna hands her some letters that were sent there from Canterlot.  There was a letter from Twilight to Sunset, a letter from Celestia to Sunset, a letter from Luna to Sunset, and a letter from Cadance to Sunset.  The letter from Luna was a particularly interesting one since Luna notes her reluctance to forgive Sunset but then explicitly compares their transgressions and transformations before deciding that Sunset was worthy of the chance that Twilight wanted to give to Sunset."
