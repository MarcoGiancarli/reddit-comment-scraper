Played pretty well against very inferior competition in two preseason friendlies?  We have everything to lose this season. Relegation is a catastrophe. I am not interested in gambling with an unproven 18 year-old. We have money we are looking to spend on attackers. Spend it.  City let him go for free at 18 years old. If they thought he would turn into a world beater do you think they'd have put up zero resistance to us taking him off their hands?  Pump the fucking breaks, man.

I'm not saying Samuelsen jumps straight into the first team, hell no.    But surely if he proves himself in some preseason friendlies, he deserves a late sub into a league game and you see how he does there.  Then from there you reassess again.  If he keeps proving himself, you keep playing him.  That's how we become a Southampton/Everton instead of a QPR in terms of spending.    We have to unearth some gems to progress, and in the process, we'll try to polish some boring rocks, too.  Samuelsen at least deserves a chance to find out which one he is"

Hammers,3dxsqx,RubiconGuava,9,Mon Jul 20 12:42:27 2015 UTC,It's also important that when the daves came we had an overpaid and underperforming squad which had no value to resell. The daves basically had to remake it from scratch.   In that timeframe Soton spent a bit of it in the league 1 and championship. So that'd keep their net spent down a lot.

Hammers,3dyxhl,HomieApathy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:47:20 2015 UTC,Hmm. I think we've moved on from the days of needing to gamble to obtain potential quality. He's a busted flush and he won't improve our squad any more than Freddy Adu would. I could be proven wrong and he makes a big turnaround but the reality is that these things rarely happen. Wages remain an issue so I would much prefer we spend it on someone who we can rely on personally.
Hammers,3dyxhl,I_tend_to_correct_u,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"Well that's foolish. Pato would most likely play a role like zarate. I rate him about the same, especially at this point in his career. Comparing him to Adu is just insane."
Hammers,3dyxhl,Cmoore4099,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:04 2015 UTC,I was being facetious comparing him to Adu but the point was that his reputation exceeds his worth imo. Zarate is actually not a bad comparison but we already have Zarate so have no need for Pato's (likely) substantial wages.
Hammers,3dyxhl,I_tend_to_correct_u,2,Mon Jul 20 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"Pato has played well on the wings recently from what I've heard, that's probably our weakest position right now"

Hammers,3dxvu6,Iamthescientist,13,Mon Jul 20 12:56:36 2015 UTC,I peeked at some of the Everton forums.  They're pissed about the bid (they think it's insulting) and also they don't think he'd leave Everton to go to West Ham (kind of how we all felt when Diame left us to go to Hull).  They're also saying something about Everton triggering a 1 year extension to his contract to up the cost of a move.  That makes me want to get him even more
Hammers,3dxvu6,madjoy,12,Mon Jul 20 13:00:23 2015 UTC,"They were also salty as fuck over Ogbonna and Payet.   Which makes me want to start treating them as a feeder club too, now."

Hammers,3dxvu6,TrashHawk,6,Mon Jul 20 13:44:38 2015 UTC,That thread made me laugh. Everton finished above us on goal difference last year. Those lot aren't much better than the other half of Liverpool
Hammers,3dxvu6,CarltonFuckingCole,3,Mon Jul 20 14:21:55 2015 UTC,dang they're bitter
Hammers,3dxvu6,DirtD4er,6,Mon Jul 20 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"Apart from the fact that they are our bogey team, I really have grown to detest Everton over the years, their fanbase included.  It's weird because I always thought we and Everton (clubs in cities/areas where we're stuck somewhere in the middle but not quite at the top) would share some common ground, but they seem so up themselves and far more deluded than us. Probably because they won a couple of league titles in the 80s in all fairness but still, compare their lot to Man City and Aston Villa over the years, for example, or hell even Newcastle... The atmosphere at their ground is horrendously overrated, they're not afraid of booing the team week in week out (much more so than we do), and completely vilify anyone who leaves them, even when Moyes went to Man United. I mean, that was like the biggest job in a lifetime, and he got trashed on completely by the Evertonians when he went back there in what was his last game.  In other words, please make this happen..."
Hammers,3dxvu6,Kubrickhammer,4,Mon Jul 20 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"I'd happily pay the £8m that Everyton are asking for him, especially given what we just got for Downing.  Though I must admit that we're hardly a step up.  I don't see a compelling reason for him to join us unless we're wiling to pay him significantly more than he's currently getting.  Everton may not have had a great season last time out, but they're usually pushing for the Europa League qualification spot.  It would seem strange to leave them for us, when we're still trying to improve so that we can reach where they already are in terms of league performance."
Hammers,3dxvu6,You_Got_The_Touch,4,Mon Jul 20 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"He and Martinez are not on good terms. They had a disagreement last season, and at one point, Mirallas stepped in and took a PK that wasn't his to take. He ended up hitting a post, and was subbed off at the half.  Everton have a good squad. We're getting to the point of having a good squad. If he wants to come here, I'd happily have him."

Hammers,3dy1jz,ZidanesLeftBoot,10,Mon Jul 20 13:49:35 2015 UTC,"i'm of the mind that we should put out the strongest team possible for this one. if we smashed them at home it would've been a decent run out for the youth as by all accounts they're a bit of a nothing club, but we've surrendered that privilege by failing to produce a more comfortable scoreline.  zarate has definitely earned a place, though."
Hammers,3dy1jz,TrashHawk,3,Mon Jul 20 13:55:12 2015 UTC,"We should not be cautious. Cautious is parking the bus with a 1 goal advantage for the last 15 mins and preying for anything but an equaliser - which inevitably comes - like most of last season.

Hammers,3dy1jz,ohheyeverybody,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:32 2015 UTC,I do agree. Sit Payet tomorrow and play him Thursday in order to gift a goal to Maiga or make his own. I don't think we need our whole first team out there off the hop and can afford to field a couple rotation players.
Hammers,3dy1jz,HomieApathy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"I like your thinking. Payet will make chances like he did in the first leg. Just gotta get someone on the other end to finish. I want to see Samuelsen again, too. That kid is quality."
Hammers,3dvbbf,ohheyeverybody,6,Sun Jul 19 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"I'd rather Austin to Hernandez, but when you factor in the former is likely to be double the price, it's Hernandez all day long for me. Either would be a great signing.   Mirallas seems a bit of a nob but he'd undoubtedly improve our team. Especially if Bilic brings in his 4231 formation. He also used to play up top too so he'd provide yet more cover if we played the diamond. Everton seem to be holding out for £8m though, which is probably half of what they'd get for him if he had more time on his contract.   Lanzini was dubbed another wonderkid but for some reason he went to Qatar. Hopefully his career hasn't stalled too badly and he's got his money grabbing out of the way early in his career. Seems like decent cover for Downing when you factor in we still have Zarate.   Diarra would be great all round business, decent replacement for Song until he returns, and can cover at RB too. Now that he's an actual free agent there seems nothing wrong with this deal in my opinion.   Cambiasso I'm not so keen on purely because he'll be on high wages for the role he'll be given. Defensive mid seems our most stacked position, especially if we get Diarra.   Happy days."
Hammers,3dvbbf,CarltonFuckingCole,4,Sun Jul 19 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"BeSt reason for cambiasso is that he'd be a great mentor for poyet, Samuelson and the rest of the youngsters. Teach noble too."
Hammers,3dvbbf,greg19735,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely Austin is a better target that Chicharitp. The latter is still a solid product, though.   Mirallas for 8 mil is solid business, to me.  If he had a season like he did two years ago, the price would be double. Everyone has off years, especially when you go through some trouble with the front office.  He'd be a great addition and would hopefully give Samuelsen some pointers. Man, that kid could be great though, couldn't he?!  I don't know much on Lanzini, but if he provides quality minutes, I will never turn down depth. Especially for the season we may have to go through. Europa could be rough, and we're going to need all the help we can get.   Diarra got a shit situation finally figured out. I'm happy the club haven't given up on him, because he's really quite talented.  Until Song gets fixed up and actually secured his move, Diarra makes a great addition to an already good line of defensive midfielders. And like you said, he can fill in at rb which could be a weak spot if Jenko goes down at all. Hopefully he stays fit like he did all last year.   I haven't watched too much of Cambiasso either, but a buddy is a Leicester city fan, and he is pretty high on him.  Would definitely make our mids stronger. That's a position where I could have 8 players and still think one more wouldn't hurt.   That's a strong look at a possible 3 new signings (as well as Song when his deal goes through), with a few on the fringe. Id be over the moon if we secured 3 more quality players."
Hammers,3dvbbf,untouchedURL,4,Sun Jul 19 23:07:39 2015 UTC,Here is a non-mobile link: http://newsnow.co.uk/A/783538965?-19872:788  Sourcecode | Feedback?
Hammers,3dvbbf,Kubrickhammer,3,Sun Jul 19 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Why is it slim chance at Austin? Surely what with Tottenham entering the Chicarito race we've got less of a chance at signing him.  Pure speculation but I think we've probably got about 14m (max) left to spend (which is pretty incredible given what we've spent so far), mainly thanks to Downing's sale. I'm guessing we're holding back about 6m for a winger and using the other 8m along with player swaps in the hope of getting Austin or just cash on it's own for Hernandez. Either way, i think this explains why we haven't gone all in with cash for Austin and are being linked with free agents and loan deals otherwise.  In other words, I'm guessing Austin is number one target and always has been but we can't really afford to spend more than 8m (roughly) on a striker right now. It's interesting, I don't think there's ever been a player with more potential clubs linked to him and clubs that want him without actually showing interest, if you know what I mean. Personally I think it's paramount we sign him if he goes for anything less than 15m, purely for the reason that we can't let a team around us have such a lethal striker.  Come on Tony Fernandes, you're meant to support West Ham! In my opinion Jarvis and Nolan are as close to guaranteed Championship promotion players as you can get for a team like QPR, I really think he should take it."
Hammers,3dvbbf,Runofthedill,3,Sun Jul 19 23:00:54 2015 UTC,"Spurs were also linked with Mirallas, so take that for what it's worth. We won't win a bidding duel with them for either player, but we can guarantee playing time and they can still live in London.    Austin will want a big wage bill, and you're right, the Downing sale opens up those funds nicely.  With as many teams that are reportedly in on Austin, the chances get slimmer as more teams take interest. I would rather the club secure other players with a hope to get Austin, than put all our eggs in that basket and end up not winning the bidding war, being left stranded."
Hammers,3dvbbf,AnalAttackProbe,2,Mon Jul 20 00:40:15 2015 UTC,"Also kind of hard doing business til you know how many games you really have to play. Depth isn't as necessary if you don't have Europe. Kind of that situation arsenal have every year when they aren't sure which Europe they are playing in, hard getting deals done in case you don't need them. We do need a winger, I think we are okay striker wise but would never turn down more."
Hammers,3dvbbf,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"For how we fell off after the break, I want as much depth as I can get.  I know what you're saying, we can't promise European football until we get to the group stage, really. Still, the club is on the up and hopefully some guys see that and want to join."
Hammers,3dvbbf,AnalAttackProbe,5,Mon Jul 20 12:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'd rather Austin than Chicharito... I think Austin and Sakho together could be fucking glorious... But I'd still take Chicharito because he is guaranteed to score goals.  Mirallas would easily be my favorite signing of the window, though. Fuck I rate him highly. Brings some much needed creativity to our attack."
Hammers,3dvbbf,Ryball8,3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"Mirallas had a rough year with some problems going on behind the scenes. I still think he's straight studly, and would be excited to have him. I'm most excited about Payet, but he'd be a strong second as signing of the summer."
Hammers,3dvbbf,Larph,6,Sun Jul 19 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am already very excited about Payet. But if Mirallas is fit and in form he is a game changer and I think his dribbling, creativity and service would work wonders for us (yeah, I know Payet has a lot of the same traits but we know Mirallas can do it in the PL because he has done it in the PL).  When he tore through 4 defenders before delivering a perfect ball to Lukaku against us last year, my first thought was ""I wish West Ham had a player who could do that"". It sounds like the Daves were thinking the same thing."
Hammers,3dtojv,Zer0_as_a_number,19,Sun Jul 19 10:27:38 2015 UTC,Of fucking course
Hammers,3dtojv,alanbru,2,Sun Jul 19 10:36:30 2015 UTC,I was going to say: Will anyone notice? :O
Hammers,3dtojv,Man-alive,14,Sun Jul 19 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry but at this rate I'd rather just take the hit and offload him, we can recoup the money by investing in a player who is not injured for 3/4 of the season every season!   I know he has bright moments but in the long run, it is not worth  it imo."
Hammers,3dtojv,AStereotypicalBrit,6,Sun Jul 19 11:36:29 2015 UTC,Good luck finding a club who would match his wages!  Honestly right now I think offering him those wages and Liverpool that fee was an appalling bit of business by Sam and the Daves. I mean look how fucking cautious we are over Austin and Remy based on supposed injury risks!
Hammers,3dtojv,Kubrickhammer,6,Sun Jul 19 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"But at the time, fans were ecstatic.  There were polls and people were overwhelmingly happy with having gone after him.  Hell, I'm pretty sure I even voted I was happy with the transfer window getting him.  So I can't really blame Sam and the Daves.  That said, god dammit, I really wanted him to come good.  I really do love him when he plays.  Out til October??  We all know that probably doesn't really mean October.  It was getting awfully suspicious that there hadn't been a return date announced yet...  :("
Hammers,3dtojv,madjoy,2,Sun Jul 19 13:03:34 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt, I was even happy when we signed him, thought he'd be a great player for us and he has shown glimpses of that greatness. So whilst in reflection it was bad business, at the time they did have the fans approval!  As always, I do want him to come good, I just don't think he will, he's made of glass and we can't afford to have a player like that on the wage bill, is a shame really!"
Hammers,3dtojv,AStereotypicalBrit,3,Sun Jul 19 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't mean sell him to another club, I mean terminate the contract, off the books completely! It'd be a hit but when you have a player that can't stay fit for more than a quarter of the season, that player is sucking up money that could be going elsewhere!   You are right, it was a terrible piece of business masquerading as a marque signing for the club! This is why the Dave's are more than likely being overly cautious on Austin and Remy, that combined with the fact that both of these players are getting inflated prices are making them hesitant to pull the trigger! At the end of the day though, we need to sign one and fast, to more than anything, show we mean business in the coming season, out of both, I'd take Austin!"
Hammers,3dtojv,AStereotypicalBrit,2,Sun Jul 19 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't mean sell him to another club, I mean terminate the contract, off the books completely! It'd be a hit but when you have a player that can't stay fit for more than a quarter of the season, that player is sucking up money that could be going elsewhere!   If we terminate the contract we still owe him 100% of his wages, he just won't be our player. WE'd probably still be on the books for his medical bills until he was fit."
Hammers,3dtojv,greg19735,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"Oh fuck that's a sticky situation then haha! Keep him around,  use him as a super sub, but try offload him as soon as possible! As its been said, I doubt another club will take him, beat chance we have would be trying to sell nostalgia to Newcastle but they won't have any of it!"
Hammers,3dtojv,AStereotypicalBrit,10,Mon Jul 20 06:42:26 2015 UTC,"He'll be a really expensive super sub when he gets healthy. That's all I want out of him, at this point. He can't play 90 for a long run of matches, but he'll be able to do 30 every week. Use him like United did Fellaini, and we'll have a goal in the last 30 every 4th match."
Hammers,3dtojv,ohheyeverybody,4,Sun Jul 19 13:04:33 2015 UTC,No shit!
Hammers,3dtojv,wanktarded,4,Sun Jul 19 16:24:28 2015 UTC,Man at this point I don't know what to think. On one hand I love watching him play and love what he brings to the team when he is fit and if him being out until October makes it a better chance of him returning and not getting hurt again I am all for it but at the same time I really would rather have a player who can play and play well right now.
Hammers,3dtojv,Mr_Vantastic,4,Sun Jul 19 16:58:06 2015 UTC,Always has an extended summer holiday. Genius.
Hammers,3dtojv,GilliganL,4,Sun Jul 19 11:18:44 2015 UTC,how completely expected.
Hammers,3dtojv,pancakes1271,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Am I the only here thinking that this was well within expectations after the surgery he had? Everyone's treating it like he got injured again but it's really more of a case of taking their time getting him back to proper fitness. Don't get me wrong, it's frustrating that we've yet to get a full season out of him without some form of injury side lining him for a major chunk of it, but if we are not going to move him, then I'd rather they take their time making sure he's in the best form to come back to the line up so, hopefully, he can go a longer stretch without fucking himself over again."

Hammers,3dsknw,WestHamBellend,7,Sun Jul 19 08:50:27 2015 UTC,It's fun reminding other football fans that they're helping to pay for our new stadium.
Hammers,3dsknw,WarriorCatz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:05:52 2015 UTC,"The deal is fantastic, but remember that Man City aren't paying much more for the Etihad stadium (£4m in total I believe), and £2m of that was for the naming rights so that they could continue to get £35m a year from Etihad.  It's not like we've gotten a deal that other clubs have been or would be denied.  That said, I do think it would be a nice gesture if we used some of the new EPL TV money to make a one-off bonus payment and perhaps double rent for 5 years.  It wouldn't hurt us at all, but could work wonders for PR."

As far as I know there was interest from West Ham from the start. It was rejected because Coe et al made a decision that the bid would not include a football legacy for the stadium. Either because they thought the IOC would prefer an athletics only stadium post-Olympics or because they themselves didn't like the idea. That short-sightedness is the reason why the stadium is so expensive to convert. Nothing to do with a lack of interest from us."

Hammers,3drv47,You_Got_The_Touch,8,Sat Jul 18 21:28:53 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see our first team in all it's glory!
Hammers,3drv47,Truthfulkidneybean,7,Sat Jul 18 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"Those highlights are pretty much a perfect showcase of Payet's well-rounded offensive game. He has a lot of individual talent, and he also has the type of game that can elevate those around him.  It is still way too early and it is probably unreasonable, but I'm already dreaming of him being the best CAM in the league this year."
Hammers,3drv47,egoisillusion,2,Sat Jul 18 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"It is nice to see Payet looking sharp so early on. He looked pretty damn dangerous in the highlights. Granted, the highlights offer a very limited view of how things went, but Samuelson is looking pretty lively as well. I will say, the defense looks a bit shaky from what I've seen so far. We gotta stop giving up cheap goals."
Hammers,3drv47,Ryball8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:44:58 2015 UTC,"Samuelson looked a lot more lively, considering he never really got in to his stride on Thursday after coming on as a sub. I really think that if we keep playing him against our weaker sides, he'll be ready to seriously compete for the first team CAM role by December. Not particularly confident about playing him on the wing because he looks to young and physically weak to drive past bigger players. BUT he's very skilful and has a good touch.  2nd goal: No.4 (Ogbonna!?!?) looked very lazy. I know, it's his first game but I can't help but feel disappointed. He didn't track back all the way..."

It's just a friendly, but it's good to see him picking up where he left off last year. The biggest possible danger I've heard fans of his old club was him becoming unmotivated with a big new contract. It seems like he's ready to show the world he's a top playmaker in the prime of his career.  How many games last year did we not have a single offensive playmaker in the middle of the park? Far too many. We could be in for a treat of a year if Payet stays healthy and motivated."

Hammers,3djdqh,Superfastninja,3,Thu Jul 16 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"Headed back from the ground now.  Everything went down the wings, there was next to no movement between the centre backs, the few times we got it into feet in that area on the edge of the box it made a chance, but most of the night it was just an empty space.   Their keeper did a decent job, Maiga was pretty poor and displayed 0 awareness, constantly offside, Samuelsen came on to play on the wing and didn't do a lot. Adrian had about 3 touches of the ball all night.  We kept possession well but at the cost of momentum, crowd was getting on their back as the game went on and we kept passing backwards. Need to learn to be more patient but also need to be rewarded with more drive.  Overall pretty lucky to get the goal, birkirkara did well to frustrate and break up our game, much more sporting than lusitans and clearly no mugs.  Fingers crossed for next week."

Hammers,3ditdt,AnalAttackProbe,5,Thu Jul 16 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"Shame but good luck, at least not a team in our league quite yet.  Am I the only one who's been reasonably disappointed with our transfer business so far? This is probably our most important season and we've basically spent all our money on quite a lot of risky players. So far we've only really bought 1 guaranteed first team player in Payet. I'd hope for at least 4 more players including Song, a striker and two wingers. If we're going to get a striker, i'll be very pissed off if it's not Chicarito, Remy or Austin because those are the only three we've been linked with who aren't risky.  Basically, we shouldn't be trying to get players who big teams actually want to offload, which is more or less what Everton have been doing for the past two years and, in my opinion, failed in so doing (i.e. Destro, Doumbia, Gervinho, Ogbonna). I guess Chicarito fits into that category but there's less desire to let him leave than the other ones, who are basically being offered to us. There's depth and there's just buying players for the sake of it. sorry if i'm being pessimistic, just not convinced we've done enough. Payet is an amazing coup for the club though, don't get me wrong."
Hammers,3ditdt,Kubrickhammer,3,Thu Jul 16 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"agree in one sense, disagree in another. i dont think its all about signing a bunch of players who will walk into the first team and win everything for us, thats not really going to happen. for me, its about buying a bunch of good players who can add to the squad, which i think we're doing pretty well. these signings just need to help us get through the extra fixtures that will be coming up with the EL, and then hopefully all going well we can build on it next season with a decent run in PL & EL this year. What I dont like hearing is that this season is going to be our best season/such a massive season for whufc etc, a lot of money has changed hands, and a lot of new faces have arrived, but lets not get ahead of ourselves, we're on the right track right now, and if we can get a top 8 place that'll be an absolute banger, less than 10/12 would be disappointing, but we aint looking to win the league."
Hammers,3ditdt,duckandweave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"not what i said though, it's not actually that hard to buy automatic first-team players when you look at who played in our first-team last year.  i keep looking to Hull last year, got into Europe and just spent lots of money on bulking up the squad with mostly rejects such as Ramirez, Dawson and Ben Arfa. Southampton on the other hand reinvested their cash on perhaps less well-known players who had proven themselves in other European leagues (well the Erdeversie basically!) like Tadic and Pelle. i guess we're somewhere in between with our signings so far. honestly, it's just that Payet is the only one who excites me. Put it this way, last year our two best signings were a first team player for the best team in Belgium and the best LB in the Championship. Even if they were risky themselves based on league quality they arrived from (similar to Dutch league signings for Southampton) I'd rather be taking those risks where the player in question doesn't really feel he has to prove he's not past it or that he's actually good enough for Juventus, Roma or Arsenal (Gervinho). Why should we be giving so many players second chances? Zarate fits into this as well, same with Downing and Carroll ultimately, both of whom have largely done nothing to change common perceptions of their quality.  it is unquestionably going to be our biggest season, not necessarily our most important, but when else will not getting relegated matter so much?  Ogbonna, Obiang and Payet (so...our signings basically, I'm talking shit therefore) basically fit into the calibre of player i think we should be after, though the former for a bit more cash than i would have hoped. I don't think we'll quite go down but i'm amazed that more people aren't as worried as i am. It's more the striker and forward chase that's been worrying me.  though being someone who is easy to please, the sigining of Chicarito would immediately reassure me. there's no way a team with fucking Chicarito is going down."
Hammers,3ditdt,Kubrickhammer,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"Ogbonna was a good buy, third choice behind arguable the best cb pairing in the world, he may have wanted to leave much more then the team wanted him to. Obiang is a bit of a wild card, but he really adds depth especially if the song transfer is out. Losing downing is a bit, but if we go out and buy a out and out striker or winger with the money and still bring song in I think it's good business. I also would love a young rb signing.   So I don't agree with you, one other thing, we babe about now imo to get through the season if we didn't have Europe.  So we could possibly be waiting til we for sure need depth to go out and make more purchases."

Admittedly I have no idea what's wrong with Valencia but I presume he's still on holiday after Copa. What a perfect time to let Maiga have a chance, although by the sounds of it he could be getting a bit more stuck in. Still though, by the sounds of the commentary in the last 5 minutes he's got himself on the  end of a couple of nice balls and had only been denied by a couple of good saves. If I'm honest if he plays the whole 90 I quite fancy him to score."

Hammers,3dgbyw,redditrain,2,Thu Jul 16 10:40:51 2015 UTC,Bilic really wanted him last year for us (Beşiktaş). But we couldn't get him. I think he really wants him.
Hammers,3dgbyw,DV23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"Players like this get me really excited, from watching a player like Nolan behind the strikers for the past few seasons it will be nice to be treated with  someone like Payet or Lanzini, people who play with flair and a high level of creativity."
Hammers,3dgbyw,grelch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:17:16 2015 UTC,"It's almost certainly not happening now. Van Gaal has given the lad a ring, apparently. Chicharito & Destro, on the other hand appear to be moving closer."
Hammers,3dgbyw,grelch,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:04 2015 UTC,Chicharito & Destro   Why both?
Hammers,3df05a,chrishamer09,7,Wed Jul 15 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"We will be seeded, and will avoid the top teams too already seeded. AZ, Bilbao, Bordeaux, Dinamo Moscow, Dortmund, Sampdoria, Southampton, Standard, St Etienner, Vitesse are included in the third round."
Hammers,3df05a,ThisAccountIsAVirus,4,Wed Jul 15 19:26:35 2015 UTC,Looks like the playoffs after that will include the Champions League Qualifying Losers. Which adds 14 more teams.
Hammers,3df05a,sexdrugsncarltoncole,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:00 2015 UTC,Wouldn't we avoid Southampton anyway or in the early rounds can 2 teams from the same nation meet?

Hammers,3df05a,wheepete,4,Wed Jul 15 22:10:04 2015 UTC,Being seeded is the best news possible
Hammers,3dfjas,ky2230,19,Wed Jul 15 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"Stewart knows he'll play less with the new signings, and has expressed interest to go back to his boyhood club, who have supposedly put in an offer that includes the same amount as he's making now, plus the chance of being the star player.  It's more a fact of Downing wanting to leave than is wanting to sell"
Hammers,3dfjas,drmrspkds,9,Wed Jul 15 21:44:07 2015 UTC,He was solid playing at CAM behind Sakho and Valenica the first half of last season. He wasn't as affective out wide. Check out the other Downing thread. Some good comments that will answer your question.
Hammers,3dfjas,thespacebetweenus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:48 2015 UTC,Thanks
Hammers,3dfjas,Wookie301,5,Wed Jul 15 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"He just signed what is likely has last contract. And he wanted it to be with his boyhood club. No different to Tevez going back to Boca, when he could still play for any team in Europe."
Hammers,3dfjas,GlakeBriffin32,3,Wed Jul 15 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest i think its the right decision to shift him to Boro. Yes he was solid last season and knowing he is getting old, selling him now is perfect timing"
Hammers,3dehzj,AnalAttackProbe,10,Wed Jul 15 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they get promoted. I'm happy for him, and their fans. We always like it when one of our own returns home."
Hammers,3dehzj,Wookie301,7,Wed Jul 15 17:42:07 2015 UTC,He'd be a legend there if he got them promoted you have to think

Hammers,3dehzj,Superfastninja,4,Wed Jul 15 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"Definetly, lets's use this money towards new players! Will come inn handy."
Hammers,3dehzj,kappafox,6,Wed Jul 15 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I keep thinking that the money will just be enough to pay for Jenko's one-year loan."
Hammers,3dehzj,ThisAccountIsAVirus,5,Wed Jul 15 18:24:09 2015 UTC,Also think about what we are saving on wages by all accounts Stew is one of the highest paid players at the club.
Hammers,3dehzj,You_Got_The_Touch,4,Wed Jul 15 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"I rate Downing, but that offer is too good to turn down.  Good luck to both him and Boro."
Hammers,3dehzj,chrishamer09,4,Wed Jul 15 17:42:19 2015 UTC,Great business. We lack depth in AM...but we all forgot about Big Kev. I feel like if we don't sell him and he doesn't move on. His last year on contract will be good for us to fill in for depth and for EL.
Hammers,3dehzj,Wookie301,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:16:51 2015 UTC,Probably will push through the Lanzini deal now.
Hammers,3dehzj,madjoy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"Good business for both clubs. Downing is super talented and I really do think he'll help get them promoted. Shame to lose him, but his heart is there, and the money is fair."

Hammers,3ddu56,appleman94,4,Wed Jul 15 16:48:55 2015 UTC,We easily have the coolest manager.
Hammers,3ddu56,dyanamo,5,Wed Jul 15 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"I fucking HOPE Wenger tries pushing Bilić like the did Jose.   It'll be HILARIOUS to see their manager on their injury list, too."
Hammers,3ddu56,kappafox,3,Wed Jul 15 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"Seemed very assertive when he said Jenko was willing to come in for ""at least"" a year. Might be looking too much into it, but perhaps a permanent (albeit expensive) move ahead?"
Hammers,3ddu56,madjoy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:34:51 2015 UTC,"The entire point of that contract was to ensure Arsenal could charge as much of a premium as they could reasonably get away with.  And as has been suggested elsewhere, I'm convinced Wenger wouldn't have allowed him to go out on loan without signing a new contract.  Yeah, it would have been nice to tell arsenal to pound sand and fuck off, but Jenks would rot on their bench.  I'll start getting hopeful when Jenko gets himself a proper agent."
Hammers,3ddu56,sexdrugsncarltoncole,3,Wed Jul 15 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but Noble is sitting next to him rather than Nolan?"
Hammers,3ddthr,AnalAttackProbe,13,Wed Jul 15 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"Disappointing, but I'm happy for him. I know we wouldn't ever match what they offered for as long as they did."
Hammers,3ddthr,aoeuisnthd,5,Wed Jul 15 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"He must really want to go. Considering he was playing for England only 8 months ago and the national team is still weak in the middle of the park, another run at CAM for us could easily have seen him recalled ahead of Euro 2016.  Regardless of how well he does for Boro, being in the Championship it's unlikely he'll get Roy's attention again."
Hammers,3ddthr,jayayseekay,6,Wed Jul 15 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"Whispers are it's a family thing and he wants to be living back in Teeside. If Newcastle or Sunderland had gone for him, he'd have joined them."
Hammers,3ddthr,wheepete,3,Wed Jul 15 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"If we got £6m for him, then I'm happy."
Hammers,3ddthr,wheepete,2,Wed Jul 15 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"I still don't like this move at all. Why get rid of Stewie when Jarvis, Nolan and O'Brien are still with the club? Downing can still contribute a lot, unlike those three.  Best of luck to him though"
Hammers,3ddthr,Arizona-Bay,6,Wed Jul 15 19:06:36 2015 UTC,"Every once in a while the club has to make an unpopular business decision. This is one of those decisions.  Stewie was brought here for 5m when he was 28 years old. He is leaving here for 5.5-7m (depend on what escalators he hits) at just shy of 31 years old.  Turning a profit on a player in his thirties is a no-brainer. Especially if the club has plans to replace him (ExWHUemployee is claiming we're looking at either Andros Townsend or Kevin Mirallas, both of which are upgrades on Stewie)."
Hammers,3ddthr,alex_texasiswest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything you said apart from Andros Townsend. He's younger but not better, plus the Spuds never do business with us anymore anyway.   Would love Mirallas though."
Hammers,3ddthr,egoisillusion,2,Thu Jul 16 10:54:44 2015 UTC,"He could still contribute a lot, but as we all know he's much better as a CAM than winger. Payet should be filling that role now. Hopefully we find a speedy/skilled winger who can go at a defender and set up our strikers. I'd rather not see Valencia being used on the wing."
Hammers,3ddthr,madjoy,3,Wed Jul 15 19:44:45 2015 UTC,I can still see Jarvis stepping up and surprising us like Downing did last year.

I think we have done a great job with the kits this year! A great way to commemorate Upton Park as well. The Keeper kits are awesome also!"

Also not sure on the pin stripes at the top. Would like to see some unedited pics, or ideally see it in person to get a better judgement! I like the idea of a future home top in a similar design to this, but all claret with darker blue half sleeves (no hoop obviously), really dig the half sleeve colour thing going on, would be a nice change in a home strip rather than the whole sleeve being blue!"

Hammers,3d9hvi,JamCal,4,Tue Jul 14 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely good news but I know what you mean - especially as they made him sign a new contract before loaning him to us.

Hammers,3d9bm9,savop31,5,Tue Jul 14 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"The money they would make back selling kits to Mexican Americans would dwarf the $10 million, it would be money well spent to them before he even set foot on a field."
Hammers,3d9bm9,jayayseekay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:39:46 2015 UTC,"I understand why they are willing, but nobody in the PL would come close to matching that figure."
Hammers,3d9bm9,DirtD4er,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot. I also think the lure of MLS might be a bit too much - for a player who's been at United and Real Madrid, going to the U.S. a la other greats from the European leagues (Keane, Pirlo, Lampard, Gerrard, Villa et al - older as they may be) has got to be a bit more glamourous than a direct step down to West Ham for a good hard mid-table scrap."
Hammers,3d9bm9,DirtD4er,4,Tue Jul 14 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"A lot closer to home and a chance to play with Kaka, too. Factor that in with the money and it isnt all that unreasonable for him to want to come Stateside."
Hammers,3d9bm9,grelch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot of Mexicans talk about Chicharito seems to be trying to angle for a better post playing career than a lot of Mexican greats get, and getting established in the USA is a good start."
Hammers,3d9bm9,Carefullychosen,5,Tue Jul 14 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"I've been hoping for a Chicarito - Carroll pairing for 3 years now, but I don't think it's going to happen"
Hammers,3d9bm9,grelch,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:24 2015 UTC,"I think you've nailed it, in a way. Chicharito would have been great for us 3 years ago. That ship has sailed for me. For me it has to be Austin. Do what it takes to bring Charlie in. Remy and Hernandez should come with big 'sold as is. no return' warning tags."
Hammers,3d9bm9,SimilarFunction,3,Tue Jul 14 20:00:45 2015 UTC,"9m - if that is what we have offered for Chicarito - would be far better spent as part of a bigger offer for Charlie Austin. Chicarito, whilst being the more glamorous signing surely wouldn't prove to be as useful a player as Austin for us. Austin's best years may well be ahead of him, but Chicarito's are certainly behind him."
Hammers,3d9bm9,randiebarsteward,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Charlie Austin would be the first bonafide potential 20 goal scorer since we signed Deano. That he tends to stay healthy, unlike Ashton & Carroll makes him a must buy."
Hammers,3d9bm9,LeanMrfuzzles,2,Wed Jul 15 17:15:54 2015 UTC,"Player I've always really liked and one I had really hoped for before last season. Now, I'm of very mixed feelings. Would I like him? Sure. Is he really the striker we need now? Doubtful.  If he flourishes given the chance he always deserved, he could be a brilliant choice. At the moment and at that price, however, I'm tempted to say Austin, who's a year younger and has the physicality, confidence, and work rate to score consistently in the prem, is the ""sure thing"" -- which is what, above all, we need up front. We're still not sure Valencia can consistently succeed in the prem, nor Zarate. And Carroll is made of glass. We need confidence and stability up front (which we get from Sakho, but from none of his would-be partners). Austin, for me, is the way to go.  Not sure it's worth gambling up front any more. Too many questions for me at striker already."
Hammers,3d9bm9,yinznat,2,Thu Jul 16 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"I have no Idea how I feel about this, stats be damned I just don't like the bloke."
Hammers,3davgu,HomieApathy,13,Tue Jul 14 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"Just posting this here so I can refer back to it in the months to come and simply cut & paste my answer to save some time and effort.  Dear Gooner/cunt/scumbag, thanks for your interest/concern/constant fucking pestering. Jenkinson is doing fine/mediocre at best/fucking shit, please could we sign him on a permanent deal/loan him for the rest of his career/send him back to warm your bench. Cheers for the bantz/Fuck off back to your own sub."
Hammers,3davgu,wanktarded,8,Wed Jul 15 10:55:53 2015 UTC,Checked the name... Damn you.
Hammers,3davgu,AnalAttackProbe,3,Tue Jul 14 21:20:20 2015 UTC,Well played.
Hammers,3d9346,alex_texasiswest,7,Tue Jul 14 13:35:16 2015 UTC,"Only fair, we're going to be playing JOB that match"
Hammers,3d9346,aoeuisnthd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:44:38 2015 UTC,Nice
Hammers,3db065,HomieApathy,7,Tue Jul 14 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"Won't be happy if we get Borini while Austin, Hernandez, and Mitrović are available."
Hammers,3db065,Wookie301,8,Tue Jul 14 23:33:10 2015 UTC,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahah.  100k a week? What are they on about?
Hammers,3db065,greg19735,3,Wed Jul 15 00:38:36 2015 UTC,I'm going to choose to ignore this rumor. Again.
Hammers,3db065,grelch,2,Wed Jul 15 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"Would be nice to sign Austin and/or Hernandez, Alexandru Maxim or Gokhan Tore, and a LB for depth. JOB, Jarvis, Nolan, and Maiga just don't cut it and should be sold off."
Hammers,3db065,Hagibest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"While 8 million is more than I'd want for him, he did show some form at Sunderland. Should Downing and Jarvis both go he would be able to provide some cover upfront and down the wing. That being said his wages would have to come way down before I would approve of the move. At the end of the day there are cheaper options that would provide the same amount of production/potential for this coming season."
Hammers,3d8pn5,WarriorCatz,5,Tue Jul 14 11:16:30 2015 UTC,It's gonna be a take on this: http://imgur.com/h2gZ0bq  Last shirt they wore before moving to the Boleyn Ground.
Hammers,3d8pn5,MattEven,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:45 2015 UTC,I was worried it'd be white. We always seem to do badly in seasons where we have a white away kit (this may be my imagination)
Hammers,3d9972,GilliganL,6,Tue Jul 14 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"That's nice but stop announcing announcements. It's probably gonna be late.  Hopefully something exciting, rather than a new contract or something, which would be nice, don't get me wrong."
Hammers,3d9972,KarimBrzo,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:16 2015 UTC,It's Jenkinson.

Hammers,3d9972,aoeuisnthd,3,Tue Jul 14 14:43:06 2015 UTC,They're probably announcing an announcement that our new kits will be announced
Hammers,3d9972,JabbersMcGee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:03 2015 UTC,That was the big announcement. Away kits tomorrow. Really big stuff.
Hammers,3d9972,ohheyeverybody,3,Tue Jul 14 15:01:31 2015 UTC,We have to stop posting these announcements of announcements. They are so shit.

Hammers,3d8e0t,JohaerJilani,18,Tue Jul 14 08:43:06 2015 UTC,"Rumor has it that in January QPR were looking to sign Matt Jarvis.  With the Hammers having Jarvis, this could work.  QPR have obviously shown interest in Matt Jarvis, and West Ham want Austin. Along with the fact that QPR have a player that West Ham want, this deal also makes sense from the West Ham point of view.       This lad getting paid by the word or something? I'd quite like to keep Jarvis as a squad member, especially with Downing looking set to leave, but if it'll make us frontrunner for Austin - and knock a few million off the price - then I'll get on board."
Hammers,3d8e0t,DrRobotTheRobotDr,3,Tue Jul 14 08:52:16 2015 UTC,"If Jarvis and Downing leave, will we have any wingers at all?"
Hammers,3d8e0t,DirtD4er,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:19 2015 UTC,Cresswell.
Hammers,3d8e0t,HomieApathy,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth it, you guys are desperate for a forward. Sakho is a decent striker, yes, but Austin will bring much more success, and he has already proved him self a great BPL player. Also, he would be keen to stay in London. Jarvis is just there, you can always replace squad players, and it would make the money aspect of the deal cheaper because its player+cash. In my opinion he will most likely go to West Ham, but if not, then Crystal Palace"
Hammers,3d8e0t,CarltonFuckingCole,5,Tue Jul 14 08:58:46 2015 UTC,What makes you say Austin will bring much more success? Sakho was injured for a third of last year and still bagged 14 goals - in his first season in England
Hammers,3d8e0t,Superfastninja,2,Tue Jul 14 09:18:25 2015 UTC,"Charlie Austin banged 18 for a side that ended up at last place last season.. I love Sakho, but Austin is a better player atm imo."
Hammers,3d8e0t,sexdrugsncarltoncole,7,Tue Jul 14 09:25:51 2015 UTC,Think Sakho is way better outside the box. Harder worker and more skilful
Hammers,3d8e0t,madjoy,5,Tue Jul 14 09:52:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, so they'd give each other a rub for their money. Don't mind taking both!"
Hammers,3d8e0t,youstank,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:29:07 2015 UTC,I'd be really upset if he went to palace instead of west ham
Hammers,3d8e0t,TrashHawk,10,Tue Jul 14 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"if you're going to link to your own blog which is entirely made of conjecture, at least make sure it's well written conjecture with some decent insight beyond ""charlie austin is a good striker, west ham like good strikers and are moving to the OS so they might want charlie austin""."
Hammers,3d8e0t,lectricwit,3,Tue Jul 14 11:42:44 2015 UTC,Why'd you give the guys over at /r/NUFC such a shitty title?
Hammers,3d8e0t,AStereotypicalBrit,3,Tue Jul 14 10:15:56 2015 UTC,"I'd take that tbh, Austin is a fantastic striker, him and Sakho would make a fantastic pair, could rotate in Valencia, Carroll (when fit) and Lee.   I think if we wrap this up quick, we can still have time to source a couple of wingers, funded from Downing leaving, there are definitely some prospects out there who would snap up a move to a London team!"
Hammers,3d8e0t,Carefullychosen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'd absolutely take this deal. And I couldn't agree more with you that the sooner we wrap up this deal and the Downing one, the sooner we can make plans for the season. I like the idea of getting business done as early as possible, mainly because it gives the squad time to gel and partnerships (particurlarly with strikers) to form."
Hammers,3d8e0t,baboudali,2,Wed Jul 15 09:54:22 2015 UTC,"If we get a striker it needs to be Austin, in my opinion. He has a proven record of 18 goals for the worst club in the league. I don't like the way names of players who are good in fifa 15 are being thrown around, feels like Jack Sullivan is doing our scouting."
Hammers,3d8e0t,jayayseekay,6,Tue Jul 14 09:08:56 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, Austin's goalscoring record is phenomenal at every level and he kept it up in the Prem last year for a shite QPR side.  The lad has 215 goals in 350 career appearances, he's clearly a natural goalscorer and proved he can do it at the top level."
Hammers,3d8e0t,WestHamBellend,2,Tue Jul 14 10:22:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't actually realise his record was that good. That's honestly very impressive."
Hammers,3d5p0h,AnalAttackProbe,13,Mon Jul 13 18:54:10 2015 UTC,So Downing's departure will pay for Jenkinson's loan. No thanks. Surely we can find a decent rb for that price and bring them in permanently.
Hammers,3d5p0h,sevan06,6,Mon Jul 13 19:22:28 2015 UTC,Don't forget to factor in Downing's wages as well.  That saving pays for the majority of Jenkinson's loan.
Hammers,3d5p0h,You_Got_The_Touch,2,Mon Jul 13 21:46:55 2015 UTC,Could probably nab Rafael from Manchester United on a permanent transfer for a comparable amount. He's being pushed out by Van Gaal since he doesn't rate him.
Hammers,3d5p0h,BuzzAir44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:43:03 2015 UTC,Yeah out of principle we should have pulled out of this deal. It's cheeky as feck. I don't rate him a great deal anyway.
Hammers,3d5p0h,Rogers_johnson,8,Tue Jul 14 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"Sack up the 12 mil and buy him. This is rigoddamndiculous. If 12 doesn't do it, look elsewhere."
Hammers,3d5p0h,ohheyeverybody,5,Mon Jul 13 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"He isn't worth 8, let alone 12."
Hammers,3d5p0h,simoalley,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:00:41 2015 UTC,He's homegrown. Sterling isn't worth half of 50.
Hammers,3d5p0h,jayayseekay,3,Tue Jul 14 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"If Clyne is our current barometer for English right backs here (£12m), Jenks is maximum £8m if that. If Arsenal had Clyne, it'd be Bellerin going out on loan!"
Hammers,3d5p0h,CarltonFuckingCole,7,Tue Jul 14 07:08:24 2015 UTC,"Clyne had 1 year remaining on his contract, and wanted out"
Hammers,3d5p0h,simoalley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:20:07 2015 UTC,Yeah that is true. Wasn't thinking about him. Was just thinking about how overpriced Sterling was.
Hammers,3d5p0h,aoeuisnthd,2,Tue Jul 14 07:55:46 2015 UTC,Agreed. No point to raising a player's value while footing a bill for the player that goes beyond his wages. Doesn't do us any favors.   I want Jenkinson but I'm not going to argue that we should be retarded about it. Only way I'd accept that loan personally is if there was a buyout clause attached.
Hammers,3d5p0h,wanktarded,7,Mon Jul 13 19:39:34 2015 UTC,He's a good young player but 4.5m for a 1 year loan sounds pretty fucking ridiculous to me.
Hammers,3d5p0h,TrashHawk,14,Mon Jul 13 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"going to be hard to muster the good feeling he got from us last year. he's a gooner merc here to impress his pimp, nothing more."
Hammers,3d5p0h,HomieApathy,3,Mon Jul 13 22:17:08 2015 UTC,Real talk.
Hammers,3d5p0h,grelch,5,Tue Jul 14 04:05:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not going to complain. It's their money and they seem to want to spend it. I think it's worth having a good rb who has played with our back line for a season. I'd rather not start from scratch again. And, if we didn't get this done now we wouldn't be able to focus exclusively on acquiring a striker.  And if we didn't sign Jenks? JOB. Lord knows I love Joey, but...... I'll take the 5 mm Jenks please."
Hammers,3d5p0h,Disco_oStu,12,Mon Jul 13 21:04:32 2015 UTC,£3.75m is what we paid to sign Cresswell permanently.
Hammers,3d5p0h,Rogers_johnson,6,Mon Jul 13 18:54:51 2015 UTC,Great signing in hindsight but these things are always tinged with a bit of luck aren't they? I mean we don't have to look too far back to see a couple of mistakes we've made in our signings (dyer.. Cough..cough).  I guess all I'm saying is that not every person we sign for £3.75m will be of the class of cresswell. I live in hope that they are but that maybe wishful thinking
Hammers,3d5p0h,randiebarsteward,2,Mon Jul 13 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. We've got scouts, we would find a nugget. What about the championship again? The Leeds kid"
Hammers,3d5p0h,SimilarFunction,3,Tue Jul 14 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"Nope!  Far too much.    Yes mate more than happy to develop your player and give him a bit of experience in Europe, now hold right there whilst I bend over the bar and drop my trousers for you."
Hammers,3d5p0h,Hagibest,2,Tue Jul 14 06:30:35 2015 UTC,There must be an option to buy that we haven't heard about. That's a ludicrous fee for a rental player.
Hammers,3d5p0h,Hagibest,2,Wed Jul 15 01:30:45 2015 UTC,Rather we signed Matel from Dinamo Zagreb or summat. Clyne would be a dream...   Ogbonna can play at RB as well as CB btw
Hammers,3d4l8o,KingGinger,8,Mon Jul 13 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Not exactly a top record in Italy, and I can't remember the last Serie A player to come over here and do well. I'd prefer Austin."
Hammers,3d4l8o,wheepete,5,Mon Jul 13 14:22:08 2015 UTC,"Austen's price will come down, but then there will be a bidding war. Not sure we will be able to come out on top, so this is a good insurance policy."
Hammers,3d4l8o,ohheyeverybody,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:44:05 2015 UTC,QPR are keen on Nolan and Jarvis which helps us.
Hammers,3d4l8o,wheepete,5,Mon Jul 13 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"I like them both as squad players honestly. Jarvis' pace is really quite excellent, and Nolan as a sub was never poor for us.  I would do one or the other easily, but both plus cash.... I'd have to weigh my options."
Hammers,3d4l8o,ohheyeverybody,4,Mon Jul 13 19:21:18 2015 UTC,Jarvis is arguably the worst signing in our long history of shit signings and Nolan is a complete has been on megabucks. Get rid.
Hammers,3d4l8o,wheepete,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"Why not both? Destro is actually a gem, not the best stats yeah but he can do very well in the future. He had a long injury but was on fire at one point and certainly one of the most promising Italian prospects atm.  And then we ought to sell off AC    Maiga Nolan Jarvis. Sign a winger or two in the likes of Maxim or Tore, and finally a LB for depth. Maybe Stefan Radu.."
Hammers,3d4l8o,Hagibest,4,Wed Jul 15 02:44:49 2015 UTC,Boleyn Insider says we're not going for him.
Hammers,3d4l8o,egoisillusion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"misdirection from the club, or were we scared off?  I'd be very happy to have Destro, but Austin remains my #1 choice."
Hammers,3d4l8o,grelch,2,Mon Jul 13 20:30:19 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer him over Austin, was very talented but hit by injuries. Didn't play too well at Milan but the fans think he wasn't fed enough. Loan to buy is good so he can prove himself."
Hammers,3d4l8o,WarriorCatz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"ITK on KUMB (Jinxed) is directly contradicting what the Boleyn Insider says - reckons Destro is signing, and on a permanent too. This could well be the making or breaking of him as an ITK but if true, very interesting. Think I'd rather Austin..."
Hammers,3d4l8o,jayayseekay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:18:58 2015 UTC,Id love both tbh. Destro is truly a gem who got hit hard by a injury.. But years ahead of him. Austin is older but a great track record last season with a poor side and would be a brilliant addition with an instant impact.
Hammers,3d505n,AnalAttackProbe,10,Mon Jul 13 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Must admit my initial reaction is one of regret that we haven't signed him permanently (and probably won't be)! If he suddenly steps up to the Arsenal starting XI then fair play to him, I'd be over the moon for the guy. If he ends up wasting away on the bench or elsewhere then I'll be gutted! Especially at a similar level club in the PL, that would hurt"
Hammers,3d505n,thrillho94,16,Mon Jul 13 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"So happy to have Carl back for another year. His new 5-year deal at Arsenal will make him nearly impossible to purchase, however.  A shame... but I'm still happy with the loan."
Hammers,3d505n,TrashHawk,8,Mon Jul 13 16:01:30 2015 UTC,"bit shit this. i'd heard that he'd cut off his own bollocks if wenger asked him to, but there goes any leverage we had to force a move or he had to press arsenal for first team play when we're done with him.   would've rather we'd have gone in for advincula instead of spending another year developing a squad player for the great nonce wizard of woolwich.  don't at all mind taking on loan players when we're undecided or they're in a bit of a career limbo, but developing them for a neighbour who they're committed to like a beaten puppy just doesn't sit well.   oh well, i'm sure i'll enjoy having him here again and it'll save us a few quid in the short term. just got to be pragmatic about it."
Hammers,3d505n,wanktarded,3,Mon Jul 13 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"Spend the time we have him looking for a decent young RB so we have a replacement when he eventually goes back to sit on Arsenal's bench (if he's even high enough in the pecking order to make their bench).  EDIT: Great news actually, simply because we'll have him back for the upcoming season, would obviously be much better & happier if we'd got him on a permanent deal, but I'm guessing he still considers his future will be as an Arsenal player..."
Hammers,3d505n,IvanEedle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yep. Really, we should try to sign two young RBs this window (Jenks being one of them).  Unless we think that is where Reece Burke's future lies?"
Hammers,3d505n,dkcork,5,Mon Jul 13 16:25:40 2015 UTC,Reece Burke. RB. Δ
Hammers,3d505n,Wookie301,3,Mon Jul 13 22:25:24 2015 UTC,"Good for him! He gets his long term future secured and then gets to come play for his one true love, West Ham United."
Hammers,3d505n,ohheyeverybody,5,Mon Jul 13 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"I say we look at Sam Byram instead, and show Arsenal we won't be fucked around like this."
Hammers,3d505n,DirtD4er,3,Mon Jul 13 17:09:29 2015 UTC,Would be very happy if we brought in Byram to backup Jenkinson/compete for the RB spot.
Hammers,3d505n,DirtD4er,2,Mon Jul 13 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"The depth would be nice. Again, it's going to be a long season. We need players."
Hammers,3d505n,DirtD4er,4,Mon Jul 13 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Glad we've got him in for an important season.  We need to find more cover at RB though, O'Brien doesn't cut it.  Sucks he signed the new deal for Arsenal though.  If they were demanding 10M for him with time running out on his deal, what will they demand for him with 4 years left?  All that to be third string at Arsenal long term.  Enjoy your cup games there Jenks."
Hammers,3d505n,DirtD4er,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"If they were demanding 10M for him with time running out on his deal, what will they demand for him with 4 years left?   This was the exact rationale Arsenal had when they offered him a new deal."
Hammers,3d505n,congratsyougotsbed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I still think he either rots on Arsenal's bench after this year, or comes to West Ham on a move.  But now Arsenal can try to charge more for him."
Hammers,3d505n,Ryball8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:17 2015 UTC,Can try? Oh they will... they definitely will.

Hammers,3d505n,DirtD4er,2,Mon Jul 13 17:47:48 2015 UTC,I would rather not get fleeced by Arsenal. Someone mentioned bringing in Sam Byram as competition. I love that idea. Promising 21 year-old RWB from Leeds.
Hammers,3d505n,sexdrugsncarltoncole,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:59:48 2015 UTC,I lean that way as well.  He's not good enough to be worth 10-12M
Hammers,3d505n,DirtD4er,6,Mon Jul 13 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"Also: Poor lad is going to ruin his career if he stays there. Two younger players ahead of him (and three total) on the depth chart. Writing was on the wall and he chose to ignore it.   Arsenal gave him the deal to keep him from moving somewhere else, not because they think he'll magically get better than the guys ahead of him."
Hammers,3d5ph7,AnalAttackProbe,7,Mon Jul 13 18:57:22 2015 UTC,Good for him. I hope he settles in and does the business. Maybe he can get his career going once and for all.
Hammers,3d5ph7,grelch,6,Mon Jul 13 19:08:33 2015 UTC,Staying as far away from Manchester as possible will likely work wonders for his career.
Hammers,3d5ph7,grelch,7,Mon Jul 13 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably. Of course who could get in trouble in Rome? Mama Mia."

Hammers,3d5ph7,Hagibest,2,Tue Jul 14 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"I miss him, even though we're having the best preseason ever. Shame about his attitude, such a class player."
Hammers,3d3zja,jayayseekay,12,Mon Jul 13 09:51:19 2015 UTC,"I'd rather he stayed with us as he can be an excellent player when on form and we could certainly do with depth of squad for the long season ahead... but if he really wants the move (which does seem to be the case) and we can get decent money for him, then it probably makes sense to take the deal on the table."
Hammers,3d3zja,wanktarded,3,Mon Jul 13 10:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, seems weird he'd want to move to the Championship though even if it is his boyhood club. He's definitely not miles away from Roy's England plans and we're pretty weak in the middle of the park (Wilshere is made of glass + we've been playing Delph ffs) - if he gets another run in the middle of the park for us I reckon he'd be adding to his caps but it is what it is"
Hammers,3d3zja,madjoy,5,Mon Jul 13 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"ITK on KUMB reckons the deal is £5m fee plus £1m if they get promoted, says they'll give him a five year deal on the same money he's on with us - club didn't want to accept but SD wanted the security."

Hammers,3d1rip,Superfastninja,11,Sun Jul 12 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good article.  Summary (it is quite lengthy):  -Sakho's ban will be one match.  -Angelo wasn't the only CB we were after, but is the one we ended up signing.  -Jenkinson will sign Monday or Tuesday.  -Glenn Johnson was never a target.  -We are weighing up a player + cash move that QPR offered us for Austin: Jarvis + Nolan + Cash ... though the cash sounds significant enough for the club to be hesitant.  -Stewart Downing ""very likely"" to leave.  -We are looking for a winger as well... two we are keen on are Townsend and Mirallas.  -We are also interested in unearthing another Sakho (French-African Striker) in Paul-Georges Ntep or Max Gradel.  -Also looking at a couple Danes who couldn't be more different physically: Yussuf Poulsen (6'5 forward) and Pione Sisto (5'7 midfielder).  -Alex Song transfer is sorted with Barca, we're just waiting to see the timetable for his recovery before agreeing.  -Ladies looking for a new manager, also looking to build on the excitement from the WWC."
Hammers,3d1rip,AnalAttackProbe,4,Sun Jul 12 20:53:21 2015 UTC,The one thing I find sort of annoying about twitter itk's is that they spend a great deal of their time sniping about those who doubted them and those who are bandwagoneer it's. If you're legit then don' worry about anyone else. Who cares.  That aside what was interesting is that we're still interested in Max Gradel (I sort of wish we weren't) and this Ntep fellow. That's a name I've not heard of before that sounds interesting.
Hammers,3d1rip,grelch,5,Mon Jul 13 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"In fairness ex gets a lot of unjust abuse, I personally don't blame him.   And on Gradel, I don't really know much about him but if clubs like Bournemouth are looking at him I'm always sceptical weather they are aiming highly or should we be aiming higher ?"
Hammers,3d1rip,tbeech20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"I know he does. Comes with the territory. Just ignore it. He knows that the people who value his info are paying attention.  As for Gradel, I remember him tearing us up when he was at Leeds. The Daves took notice and tried to grab him at the end of the season. I was on board for that because he looked great when we faced him. That was a while ago though, so I don't know. If he's still got what he had when we saw him in the championship then maybe he's worth a punt. I sort of have my doubts though. Having said that, he's basically got a goal rate of 1 for 3 at St. Etienne, which is good for a winger. Who knows."

I think he's got a slight bit more technical flair than Sakho, but Sakho is probably better in the air."

Hammers,3d1pch,ChaosRaiden,4,Sun Jul 12 23:28:44 2015 UTC,"He suffered some injury problems when he first joined us before his inexplicable loan to Madrid, but after returning from the loan spell he was a decent squad/first team player. He was a decent WB/Winger and good at charging up the wing and getting crosses into the box, I think one of his main problems really was lack of consistency."

Hammers,3d0054,adnams94,24,Sun Jul 12 09:19:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bilic will be fired if he doesn't finish top 8.  I think there IS something in his contract about how he will be fired with no compensation if we get relegated, or at least that's the rumour I've heard.  I'm feeling good about the transfer window!  Payet and Ogbonna are both smart signings that should improve the squad.  We still really need an RB.  Rumours are that we'll get Jenks back on loan pretty soon, but our backup RB (Joey O'Brien) isn't at the standard of the rest of the squad now, so we really need to get that sorted.    Our striker situation is okay, but Sakho is the only one I have confidence in to get 15+ goals... Valencia could still come good but hasn't proven himself.  And Andy Carroll is fantastic when he's fit, but he hasn't been fit for us often enough to count on.  The owners plan to get in another striker (possibly on loan) still this window, and I agree that's a smart idea.  If we lose Downing (and reports sound like he wants out), we may need to further strengthen his position, too, at least for depth.  I think a lot of us were surprised that Bilic made a new CB one of his top priorities because it was a position I thought we were more sorted in (3 starter-quality CBs already - Reid, Tomkins, and Collins with Reid and Tomkins both having just signed new long-term contracts - and 3 younger players on the verge of breaking through - Doneil Henry, Reece Burke, and Reece Oxford).  But Bilic watched the videos of us playing last year and said that's what he wanted.  To be fair, we have had CB injury crises both of the last 2 years, and our defensive record last year wasn't amazing.  I'm not actually expecting us to get top 6 this season even with the additions, but it's nice just to be pushing for it.  I do think we'll be closer to the ""push for Europa"" battle than the relegation battle... and that alone is exciting!! Realistically, though, a lot of our competitors have done a good job strengthening during this window, too (Stoke and Crystal Palace come to mind, and Southampton and Swansea are going to be tough to beat, too).  Plus, with a new manager and so many new, foreign players, it could take time for everything to click together.  And if we make the group stages of the Europa League, that could take a toll on player fatigue.  So all of our strengthening and ambition could end up being just to stand still.  Still, in the long term, I think we're in a good position relative to the other teams.  We're moving to a bigger stadium in a year (and we have the fan base to fill it or at least come close), we're in London (which seems to help attract players), and Bilic is the epitome of cool.  We have owners who are true fans of the club, buy pretty smartly, communicate a lot with the fans (maybe too much ;)), and don't sack managers on a whim.  We have a history of a strong academy, and though our last manager (Big Sam) didn't build on that or give them a chance, they've cleaned out some of the guys who were never going to make it and now we've got a number of exciting prospects again.  Plus, this season we've got the Europa League for extra matches so everyone will get a runout! Oh, and Bilic has just said he wants more goals from midfield - so here's hoping we keep building on the exciting, attacking game we had at the start of last year when we rocketed to 4th at Christmas!    Things are looking good!"

Hammers,3d0054,AnalAttackProbe,4,Sun Jul 12 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"If we finished 10th and did pretty decent in cups, Bilic won't be fired I don't think, especially because he will have an easy time capturing hearts of hammers. But the 6-8th is a consistent expectation for the coming 3-4 years which I hope Bilic stays for and can create a legacy. Now is the best time to do it at West Ham we are poised to rocket forward. I have a tingling feeling though that the BoD are going to sell up shop to some Arabs within the next 5-6 years."
Hammers,3d0054,ItchyNutSack,3,Sun Jul 12 11:01:11 2015 UTC,I don't think Sullivan will sell but maybe gold.
Hammers,3d0054,Rogers_johnson,2,Sun Jul 12 12:06:10 2015 UTC,"Depends who comes knocking!  I think if they get an incredible offer that they think will really improve West Ham, they'll sell.  I don't think they'd sell to any rich person who came knocking, though."
Hammers,3d0054,madjoy,5,Sun Jul 12 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"While a top 8 finish would be great, I honestly don't see Bilic being fired unless we are relegated. West Ham has only had 15 permanent managers in its history, and the current ownership has already shown they are willing to give a manager time to see out his contract. I can't see why things would suddenly change short of a complete disaster."
Hammers,3d0054,egoisillusion,4,Sun Jul 12 12:43:00 2015 UTC,"No, the clause in his contract says if the club gets relegated this season he will be outright fired. Not has to finish in the top 8. People believe the most absurd things."
Hammers,3d0054,MattEven,3,Sun Jul 12 19:04:07 2015 UTC,I saw your board (or whatever your management system is) said something like the manager needs a top 8 or 6 finish to keep his job   I would seriously doubt this (is there a source for the quote?) as we're not that sort of club.

It did sound a little extreme in terms of contractual expectations."
Hammers,3d0054,tyler3794,5,Sun Jul 12 15:46:09 2015 UTC,That was something they said last year about Sam I think
Hammers,3d0054,madjoy,3,Sun Jul 12 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"And that was because he rubbed almost everyone the wrong way (including, reading between the lines, David Sullivan) so the standards for him were a little higher :p"

Hammers,3cxk7s,madjoy,3,Sat Jul 11 17:53:38 2015 UTC,Why was the ginge goal disallowed? Neither him nor Nolan were offside.
Hammers,3cxk7s,Jarmz,4,Sun Jul 12 03:09:04 2015 UTC,Adrian and his mind games. Love it.
Hammers,3cxk7s,sevan06,3,Sat Jul 11 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"Randolph was in goal yesterday, not Adrian. Love a cheeky keeper though."
Hammers,3cxk7s,GilliganL,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:04:50 2015 UTC,Starting line up said Adrian unless he was subbed off at some point.
Hammers,3cxk7s,sevan06,2,Sun Jul 12 16:29:07 2015 UTC,We changed the entire starting 11 at half time except Cresswell (think it was him) so first half was probably Adrian but the pen was against Randolph.
Hammers,3cxk7s,GilliganL,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:09:36 2015 UTC,Oh yeah you're right of course.
Hammers,3cxk7s,sevan06,4,Mon Jul 13 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice header from Nolan, narrow angle backwards chip header. Don't see those every day."
Hammers,3cxk7s,ImNotFrankUnderwood,2,Sat Jul 11 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"If you aren't frank underwood, who are you?"
Hammers,3cxk7s,kmurp62rulz,3,Sun Jul 12 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"I think under the circumstances, with the team just coming back from Cork and playing quite a few youth players, that was a good performance! It's the pre season, it doesn't need to be a victory every single time! Overall though, they are looking pretty solid!"
Hammers,3cxk7s,AStereotypicalBrit,2,Sat Jul 11 19:45:48 2015 UTC,My thoughts?  1) Nobes needs to trust himself to shoot more often.  I saw him in a similar position more than a handful of times last season.  2) Sakho with that forced error on their keeper.  lolls  3) Excellent reaction shot from Samuelsson.  Looking forward to seeing more of that lad.  4) Back line was pretty abysmal from what I saw.  Here's hoping we tighten that up.  5) Kevin Nolan bitching at the linesmen in a friendly.  lol.
Hammers,3cxk7s,aoeuisnthd,2,Sun Jul 12 00:57:05 2015 UTC,"Sakho's goal (start watching at 2:35) is so cheeky, I love it!  (brits, am I using ""cheeky"" right?)"
Hammers,3cxk7s,appleman94,11,Sat Jul 11 17:54:23 2015 UTC,its more of a jammy goal than a cheeky goal tbh
Hammers,3cxk7s,JabbersMcGee,2,Sat Jul 11 19:02:03 2015 UTC,"I guess I was thinking, the fact that he even went for it at all"
Hammers,3cxk7s,ThisAccountIsAVirus,4,Sat Jul 11 20:47:03 2015 UTC,"Right off his arse into the top corner. Don't see many strikers with that in their locker. I think that was Maiga with the miss at 7.15, there really is no hope for him"
Hammers,3cxk7s,JabbersMcGee,5,Sat Jul 11 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"It was not Maiga, he wasn't on the field at that point, I believe it was Janai Gordon."
Hammers,3cxk7s,ThisAccountIsAVirus,3,Sat Jul 11 21:57:15 2015 UTC,Ah right. Maiga definitely played some part in the game I just presumed a gaping howler would be him
Hammers,3cxk7s,newdork,3,Sat Jul 11 22:20:30 2015 UTC,Haha it is usually a safe bet but I hope if he is playing with another striker we will see him at his best.
Hammers,3cwxnp,DV23,3,Sat Jul 11 14:25:12 2015 UTC,3-2 in the first half?   Of course they can't televise that.

Hammers,3cwmx0,madjoy,2,Sat Jul 11 13:20:23 2015 UTC,an elbow to the opposition supposedly. only heard from people who uploaded stuff and said they were there
Hammers,3cwmx0,KingGinger,2,Sat Jul 11 14:06:24 2015 UTC,Apparently he elbowed another player
Hammers,3cwmx0,bradyr2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:06:53 2015 UTC,Hopefully just one game. We are a better team when Sakho is in the lineup.
Hammers,3cwttf,ohheyeverybody,9,Sat Jul 11 13:42:52 2015 UTC,"""We'll start with Adrian in goal, Alex Pike, Winston Reid, James Collins and Aaron Cresswell in midfield.  Pedro Obiang, Martin Samuelsen, Mark Noble and Kevin Nolan are in midfield, and Diafra Sakho partners Modibo Maiga up front.""  That's from the team website.  So we're playing a 0-8-2, it seems.  Bold strategy from the new manager, let's see if it pays off for 'em."
Hammers,3cwttf,Superfastninja,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:47:56 2015 UTC,Probably a 4-4-2 diamond/4-3-1-2 formation. http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=7qx74 - would be my guess

Hammers,3cwttf,njmase,5,Sat Jul 11 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"23: GOAL! Just as we were saying Samuelsen looked lively he's added a goal to that. Cresswell did very well in the build-up, firing a pass into Sakho's feet and continuing his run into the box. Sakho laid off to the left-back, who checked and returned the favour. Sakho's shot is blocked by the defender, but the ball drops to Samuelsen, who fires into the bottom left hand corner. 3-1."
Hammers,3cwttf,wanktarded,2,Sat Jul 11 14:26:35 2015 UTC,The kid looks promising..really hoping for some highlights on the WHU site
Hammers,3cwttf,enteij_vex,2,Sat Jul 11 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"Going by the text updates he's playing a solid game in midfield, could be a very exciting prospect for the future."

Hammers,3cwttf,royalt213,3,Sat Jul 11 14:07:39 2015 UTC,"12: GOAL! The Posh's lead didn't last long. A nice move from the Hammers sees Aaron Cresswell pasxs square to Nolan, who passes on to Mark Noble and he slides home neatly. 1-1."
Hammers,3cwttf,wanktarded,2,Sat Jul 11 14:16:42 2015 UTC,Nobes! Nice.
Hammers,3cwttf,AStereotypicalBrit,3,Sat Jul 11 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"13: GOAL! Another! 2-1 to the Hammers immediately. The ball comes back to goalkeeper Anlwick and Sakho is rewarded for chasing a lost cause as the keeper's kick cannons off the Senegal frontman and flies in. 2-1 West Ham, eventful start."
Hammers,3cwttf,AStereotypicalBrit,3,Sat Jul 11 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"3rd goal for sakho, hahaha"
Hammers,3cwttf,wanktarded,2,Sat Jul 11 14:25:15 2015 UTC,Samuelsen performing fantastically by the sounds of it! The academy seems to have produced some great prospects! Hopefully we'll see some highlights!
Hammers,3cwttf,wanktarded,6,Sat Jul 11 15:04:49 2015 UTC,"Samuelsen was a summer signing from City, actually.  He is impressive, though."
Hammers,3cwttf,TweetPoster,3,Sat Jul 11 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I remembered that as soon as I posted but I just didn't bother to correct myself! Thought someone would pick it up pretty quick!  Even so, he has performed great today by all accounts, and in the previous matches our academy boys have always impressed too!"
Hammers,3cwttf,royalt213,2,Sat Jul 11 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"61: Straight after the goal, the Hammers made nine changes. Only Aaron Cresswell is left on the pitch from the starters and he's in central midfield. Elsewhere, we have Sam Howes in goal, Kyle Knoyle, Josh Pask, Doneil Henry and Stephen Hendrie across the back. Amos Nasha, Cresswell and Moses Makasi are in midfield, and Nathan Mavila, Jaanai Gordon and Djair Parfitt-Williams make up the front three."

Hammers,3csstv,CarltonFuckingCole,6,Fri Jul 10 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"I hope this signing comes good! Some of the comments coming from Juve fans weren't the best, but regardless we need cover at cb. We always struggle with injuries, and I think it's too early to rely on Burke, Henry and Oxford if we are short at the back. Especially with all the extra games we will be playing this season, we need depth!   Welcome Ogbonna, hope he can form a good partnership with our existing back 4!"
Hammers,3csstv,blovell91,11,Fri Jul 10 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"Juventus are blessed with two of the top 10 centre backs in the world unfortunately for Ogbonna. Ogbonna has ten caps for Italy, he can't be that bad."
Hammers,3csstv,madjoy,8,Fri Jul 10 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like the comments I was reading from Juve fans were like 80% good (just not as good as their amazing top 3) and only 20% bad.    like I said in another thread, it's just a big upgrade to be taking a CL finalist's reject rather than, say, an Aston Villa reject"
Hammers,3csstv,JabbersMcGee,3,Fri Jul 10 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"Any Juventus game Iv seen Ogbonna play in he looks solid, ridiculous pace for someone so strong. Juventus are critical of anyone who's not world class because they're a team so dominant in their league and champions league finalists that they demand perfection. Ogbonna isn't perfection but we're lucky to have a top tier Centre Back. Can't wait to see Ogbonna in claret and blue"
Hammers,3csstv,Ryball8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:43:35 2015 UTC,This guys seems like a good signing. Bolsters the squad. With the addition of Jenks we should have a pretty staunch defense...I'm assuming Ogbonna will slot into the starting 11?
Hammers,3csstv,Runofthedill,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:37:13 2015 UTC,Him or tonks obviously. I think if he overtakes tonks he'll finally make that move to new castle we've been hearing about for years.

Hammers,3csstv,egoisillusion,3,Fri Jul 10 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's quite lived up to the hype and expectations people had for him. IMO he is a slight reach for what we are paying, but I'm very happy to improve squad depth and talent.  Also, he will be a great addition when I'm using West Ham online in FIFA16."
Hammers,3csstv,ewybradyy,3,Fri Jul 10 15:48:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that sweet 75+ pace 6'4 CB we get really puts the icing on the cake in this deal
Hammers,3csstv,Wookie301,5,Fri Jul 10 17:10:01 2015 UTC,It's only an 8 figure fee in Euros. Works out to about 8m spread over 3 years. Bargain!!

Hammers,3cu54i,AnalAttackProbe,2,Sat Jul 11 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"Plus the capital one cup run, and not to mention the fa cup run we'll make ;)  I understand, though. Growing up, I played baseball and we had season tickets to the Cleveland Indians. My summers were baseball. Whether I had a game, my brother did, or we had tickets to a game, life was baseball.

Never played properly competitively again after that. Fell out of love with the game for a couple years, went to work, got into Motorsport and that. That was 7 or so years ago and now I'm right back into it in the best way, but in moderation this time. Too much of anything is never a good thing"

I didn't see another thread to put this in, and it's no longer Friday, but I'd like to see the Hammers make it to group in Europa.  I'm not sure if it's ""the more the merrier"" or ""sharing the pain makes it hurt less"" or some terrible combination of the two.  But either way, good luck with the rest of the slog through qualifiers and playoffs."
Hammers,3ctyg8,AnalAttackProbe,7,Fri Jul 10 19:24:09 2015 UTC,Definitely feel a out and out winger is more important then striker. I'd love lee to get some run as the 4th choice striker personally.

That puts him fit outside the window.  I just want the jenko deal finalized.  On loan is fine, just get him in here.  Doumbia is my dream atm.  Get him in on loan.  That man can ball.  I don't think Downing is leaving.  If he were, we would've picked up Cabaye."
Hammers,3ctyg8,ohheyeverybody,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think Downing is leaving. If he were, we would've picked up Cabaye.   I think the issue with Cabaye was wages. He wanted like 100k a week and we were not willing to go anywhere near that. I wouldn't use that as a way to gauge whether or not Downing leaves. We're still being heavily linked to midfielders (particularly outside mids) and several teams want Downing."
Hammers,3ctyg8,NotGoodAtUser-Names,2,Fri Jul 10 19:43:57 2015 UTC,That's fair.  If we picked up Miralles I'd be ecstatic.  He had a dip in form but i guess there were internal problems there.  He's class when he;s on form.
Hammers,3ctyg8,tyler3794,2,Fri Jul 10 20:12:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should sell Jarvis, he performed well against Lusitans and last pre-season I just don't think Allardyce have him a good enough shot and I think he deserves one more chance before we get rid of him.

Unless he went to the floor because Sakho punched him in the face that's a bit harsh I think.

Hammers,3cpzdq,appleman94,2,Thu Jul 9 21:08:17 2015 UTC,I didn't realize they were playing in so many tournaments. I never thought I would be into football but I'm addicted and I can't get enough West Ham. Thanks for the response.
Hammers,3cpzdq,appleman94,3,Thu Jul 9 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, the premier league is the weekly game, and then the other games are every so often."
Hammers,3cpzdq,wheepete,2,Thu Jul 9 21:19:30 2015 UTC,Rule 1 - it's a squad not a roster ;)   Last year we really suffered with injuries meaning players were playing out of position and our form suffered. The new signings have really stepped the squad up to the next level and some of the first team players from last year like Noble and Downing will be starting fewer games but kept in order to rest and rotate players as we could potentially play 60+ matches this season.

Hammers,3colsx,CarltonFuckingCole,5,Thu Jul 9 15:16:27 2015 UTC,This.  Jack said on twitter that Sakho wasn't for sale at any price. This aligns well with David Gold's article for the official website yesterday. The club believes Sakho can become the next World Class striker.
Hammers,3colsx,AnalAttackProbe,11,Thu Jul 9 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"Probably just bullshit, but its been reported from a few sources this afternoon.  Nonetheless, do not anticipate us selling Sakho under any circumstance this window.  Sure, he's valued at £15m, but as a club I imagine we value him a lot more. He's settled in well, and along with everyone else at the club, I expect him to better his goal tally from last season, this year."

Hammers,3ckgyx,Superfastninja,5,Wed Jul 8 16:45:32 2015 UTC,One or two people on KUMB hinting that the defender mentioned is Dragovic. There's no way Ogbonna can be construed as one of the best defenders in Europe.
Hammers,3ckgyx,Kubrickhammer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:25:22 2015 UTC,What is the rumored price around Dragovic?
Hammers,3ckgyx,AnalAttackProbe,2,Wed Jul 8 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"North of 20m Euros. I sincerely doubt we pay that much.  The ""best defender in Europe"" thing is just classic club speak. Always talk up a new signing and all that."
Hammers,3ckgyx,Kubrickhammer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"There's 'classic club speak' and absolute bollocks though. Ogbonna wouldn't even make the top 200 defenders in Europe, as someone rightly said on the forum.  All they said is that Dragovic was Bilic's number one target and that the club were trying to get him. Who knows, maybe both!"
Hammers,3ckgyx,AnalAttackProbe,3,Wed Jul 8 21:04:00 2015 UTC,If we buy both I will lose it. Absolutely unnecessary spending.
Hammers,3ckgyx,Kubrickhammer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"Really? Even with Ogbonna we only really have one great centre back, and none under 25 for that matter. Oxford, Henry and Burke are still too raw."
Hammers,3ckgyx,AnalAttackProbe,3,Wed Jul 8 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"We aren't Manchester City. We cannot afford to drop £30m on centerbacks when we just signed two of our own (Reid and Tomkins) to massive extensions.  Reid got 5 years and £65k per week. Tomkins got 5 years and £50k per week. Ogbonna (who has a medical tomorrow) is rumored to have agreed to 4 years at £60k per week.  How much of our wage structure do you want to dedicate to CB? Because we're already on the brink of spending too much by bringing Ogbonna in... So yes, I would be absolutely furious if we spent £25-30m on CBs this window."
Hammers,3ckgyx,sexdrugsncarltoncole,3,Wed Jul 8 22:19:04 2015 UTC,Ogbonna is not a world class defender. Fucking hell
Hammers,3ckgyx,AnalAttackProbe,3,Wed Jul 8 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"My sources have told me that the Club are very close to making their fourth signing of the summer and hope the player will be ready to sign a contract in the near future.  My understanding is that he was one of the best defenders in Europe last season and will be an exciting new addition to the West Ham United squad.   Think this is still Ogbonna. Abdennour's price is high and Ogbonna is still a ""great defender"", but the two in front of him (Chiellini and Bonucci) are the best pairing on the planet right now.   My understanding is when the fourth new signing is announced, the Club will turn their attentions to signing another striker/goalscorer.   We've been linked to a bevy of them. This isn't surprising.   The Club are also looking to bring in another highly rated midfielder and hope a loan move will also be finalised by end of the month.   I've bolded what I found pertinent. That's two different players, not one. I would guess Song permanently and Lanzini on a loan.  ...Most importantly: What about Jenks??"
Hammers,3ckgyx,MisterMejor,5,Wed Jul 8 17:00:47 2015 UTC,I think Jenks is the loan guy and Song the ''Highly rated midfielder''
Hammers,3ckgyx,AnalAttackProbe,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:34 2015 UTC,Could be right.

Hammers,3clfjv,thespacebetweenus,2,Wed Jul 8 22:08:26 2015 UTC,It will be a difficult pill to swallow if we decide not to sign him because the board is afraid from the Carroll incident and then he goes elsewhere.

The 27-year-old had agreed terms with West Ham and was waiting for the clubs to iron out the finer details of his transfer fee. However, the midfielder is understood to have a piece of floating bone which may require surgery and could rule him out for up to three months.   What the fucks a floating bone"
Hammers,3clfjv,CarltonFuckingCole,7,Wed Jul 8 21:08:08 2015 UTC,He's got a hard on that won't go down.

Hammers,3cjigv,Carefullychosen,6,Wed Jul 8 11:59:53 2015 UTC,According to ExWHUemployee:   We will not be going for Cabaye now! He wanted to join us but club were not prepared to spend that money for a position where we have depth   Fair enough... 10m (read 13m yesterday) is a little steep for a 29-year-old player in a position that's not critical to strengthen
Hammers,3cjigv,madjoy,2,Wed Jul 8 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"I've just had a thought - now that Palace have splashed out on Cabaye, has that improved our odds of getting Charlie Austin?"
Hammers,3cjigv,madjoy,3,Wed Jul 8 12:46:43 2015 UTC,"oooh that's an interesting thought.  But if we got Ogbonna, probably not.  I just have a feeling that may be the last signing we're prepared to spend big cash on.  ITKs and stuff have been hinting at a loan deal for a forward rather than a purchase.  but.... maybe!

Hammers,3cgblk,AStereotypicalBrit,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"While I think the low prices will certainly keep it full or nearly-full in the first season, I think the team's form will dictate attendance beyond then. No matter how well the fans fill the Boleyn or how long the ticket prices remain low (which will probably fade over time), you simply aren't going to draw 55,000 consistently if the team is bottom half. Hopefully all these signings and the boost from the move will keep us as a top half regular."
Hammers,3cgblk,gonewiththewinds,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is any doubt that the teams form overall will be one of the main factors in bringing the crowds into the OS. I do think the new stadium will be a major draw initially though, but you are correct, IF we're bottom half I think it will be difficult to bring in that size crowd consistently. But I do like to have some optimism and I think we have a good chance of staying top to middle table consistently in our first season there!"
Hammers,3cgblk,AStereotypicalBrit,2,Wed Jul 8 10:10:52 2015 UTC,Don't know about packed. Maybe for the first game and a few after but attendance will drop and we won't sell out the majority of our first season.
Hammers,3cgblk,Cmoore4099,6,Tue Jul 7 21:25:41 2015 UTC,"I can see it hitting the high numbers regularly still! I've said before but a lot of people who may have been priced out before, will now be able to afford tickets, if they're in London it'll be even easier for them! Then you have people from the larger commuter towns, Romford, Hornchurch, Brentwood, Chelmsford, Colchester, Southend and Shenfield, all of them can get to Stratford in 30 minutes on the fast trains, you will also have more going just for the general tourism, I think it'll keep steady! Especially since almost all the aeaakn tickets are sold out too now!"

Hammers,3cfjx7,sexdrugsncarltoncole,2,Tue Jul 7 15:25:23 2015 UTC,I would hate Reid as skipper. He put us through months of uncertainty in the hopes that he'd receive a better offer. He still needs to prove his loyalty and happiness at the club before being captain of a team full of players that actually do love the side.
Hammers,3cfjx7,GilliganL,7,Tue Jul 7 21:39:28 2015 UTC,"""(Kouyate) is as good as Mo Diame thinks he is.""   Apart from that hilarious appeal for Cheik, I'd have to go with the following:  1) Reid   2)Noble  3)Song  Really the first two are the only serious contenders for me. Much as I love Adrian, he's too mercurial - and a captain needs to be able to defuse a situation. He can't do that from the goal line. Song is there despite his dip in form because he's always seemed to keep a cool head."
Hammers,3cfjx7,aoeuisnthd,6,Tue Jul 7 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"I would say:  1: Reid (showed loyalty in signing an extension while other offers were on the table, will play if he is healthy).  2: Noble (Mr. West Ham, only question is how much playing time he'll get)  3: Adrian (Already well on his way to legendary status)"
Hammers,3cfjx7,madjoy,6,Tue Jul 7 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that Cresswell doesn't get a mention by their criteria, since he was injury-free and superbly consistent last year, and he has been here just as long as Kouyate.  However, he doesn't seem to have a very imposing/commanding presence, which is also important.  1) Noble.  Don't underestimate the importance of being Mr. West Ham.  Hell, I'm still convinced that his fishing bromance with Jenko is ultimately the reason Jenko is so desperate to come back to the club  2) Kouyate.  I think he'd make an amazing captain (and he seems like  he's been a good influence on Sakho) but I'd prefer someone who has been at the club longer  3) Carlton Cole when we get him back  TBH wasn't too impressed when Reid or Song captained last year."
Hammers,3cfjx7,zmasta94,5,Tue Jul 7 18:52:39 2015 UTC,Reid's captaincy was clouded by his contract drama. I felt the same way.
Hammers,3cfjx7,NotGoodAtUser-Names,4,Tue Jul 7 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"My favourites for captain are; Noble, if he doesn't find himself not playing as much. Cresswell, because he is passionate, consistent, a fan favourite and it could help persuade him not to leave in the future. Adrian because he is a legend in the making and making him captain might curb the few outbursts he has and help him mature into one of the best goalkeepers we've ever had."
Hammers,3cfjx7,duckandweave,9,Tue Jul 7 15:21:02 2015 UTC,"i think creswell is a bit too quiet to be captain personally, but i agree with the other two. I think Noble should get it really, he's been around for ages, and sure his form dipped a bit, but when he captained he always seemed to push the other and show his passion. He always wants to do right by the team. Adrian, after he gets another couple of seasons under his belt for me. As for Kouyate, not just yet, but maybe as a third?"
Hammers,3cfjx7,NotGoodAtUser-Names,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:29:38 2015 UTC,I think Cresswell might be more vocal with the responsibility of the captaincy and yeah Kouyate as a third would be ideal. Maybe push him up to vice captain in a few years if he keeps improving

This is coming from multiple sources... sounds like he really does want to leave.  But they can't just woo Downing, they've got to woo West Ham.  C'mon, offer a fair offer considering he was one of our best players when we were at our heights last season. I think 7m would be the magic number."
Hammers,3cg421,madjoy,4,Tue Jul 7 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"I actually thing there's a good chance he will go:   We have brought in quite a lot of midfield talent The board wants to lower the avg age of the squad Downing is likely on a big wage packet that maybe doesn't justify his age.    With Song, Payet, Noble, Obiang, Kouyate, Amalfitano...potentially Zarate/Valencia as options for the mid...and Lanzini/Cabaye speculated...Poyet/Oxford on the brink...maybe there's enough depth?"

Hammers,3cefz2,AStereotypicalBrit,5,Tue Jul 7 07:18:40 2015 UTC,"Good morning lads and ladies!  I know this is entirely off the topic of our great team, but our great team belongs to what is,in my opinion, the best city in the world! 10 years ago today, at roughly 8:50am, London was shook by three bombs exploding on rush hours trains in Aldgate, Edgware Road and between King's Cross and Russell Square. At roughly 9:47am the number 30 bus was by a bomb in Tavistock Square.   These attacks killed 52 and injured more than 700 people. There is a nationwide minute silence today at 11:30am to remember the victims of the attacks. So, what I'm getting at, is just lets all, at home and abroad, take a moment to remember these people today.  Apologies if anybody feels this is over-dramatic or just generally not in good taste, I just thought we needed to remember them today."
Hammers,3cefz2,DrRobotTheRobotDr,5,Tue Jul 7 07:30:37 2015 UTC,"London as a city has that reputation for being somewhat cold & uncaring, but the character and resilience shown by its population in the immediate aftermath of this atrocity was incredible. Millions of people, in one of the worlds largest melting pots, standing together against extremist ideologies - they weren't going to cower in terror. I've read and listened to countless first hand accounts of events on the day, and it all just seems so unfathomable to me."
Hammers,3cefz2,Wookie301,3,Tue Jul 7 08:25:50 2015 UTC,"I could not have put it better myself. In the face of this atrocity, this city, which is no stranger to terrorism, and its people all stood up as one against the blank face of terrorism.  The first hand accounts are just as you said unfathomable, to listen to what the everyday people did, both on the underground and on the city streets, the doctors and nurses that literally ran across London from their own respective hospitals, the responses from outside London too, like Essex and the Thames Valley, all just beyond words for me."
Hammers,3cefz2,TrashHawk,2,Tue Jul 7 09:15:07 2015 UTC,"Was on my way in to pick up my visa to cross the pond. If I hadn't been lazy and slept in on my day off, I could have been on that train."
Hammers,3cefz2,dyanamo,8,Tue Jul 7 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"that was a decade ago? mental.   the thing i remember most wasn't some outpouring of defiant unity or pledge to conquer terrorism, it was something more resolute to my mind: a collective shrug.   not in a way that was disrespectful, but for all the media reports trying to whip it up into another 9/11, the people around me just saw it as a bit of a piss take by a bunch of nutjobs and got on with their lives.  it's like it triggered the latent blitz spirit in londoners and ended up like water off a duck's. it wasn't a reason to live in fear, it was a reason to moan that the tube would be messed up and it'd take you ages to get home.  can't see the same thing happening today with everyone permanently pointing their iphone at their face looking for any opportunity for hysterics."
Hammers,3cefz2,AnalAttackProbe,3,Tue Jul 7 09:48:18 2015 UTC,"You are right, the city as a whole, whilst obviously devastated and distressed, kind of picked itself up and got on with what it needed to do.  The city is no stranger to attacks, with the IRA attacks, the Iranian Embassy Siege and most notably as you said, the Blitz, and so when this happened, they did just deal with it.  You are right though, if this was to happen now, you'd see Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Periscope etc. just blowing up."
Hammers,3ce2fy,AnalAttackProbe,5,Tue Jul 7 04:45:28 2015 UTC,"I believe that one of the Club's major targets has all but agreed to join and should put pen to paper when he returns from holiday.  My understanding is that the player has agreed a 12-month loan deal and is another exciting signing for Slaven Bilic.   Jenkinson, almost certainly.   However, my sources have told me that a move for another summer target has unfortunately been delayed after the player picked up an injury and is expected to face a spell on the sidelines.  I believe that the Club will not consider making a move until the injury has cleared up.   Isn't Song being treated for an injury at Chadwell Heath right now?   There is better news surrounding further additions to the squad and I have been told that the Club expect to have the first of two or three major signings by the middle of the month.   I would assume this is Ogbonna, if ESPN is to be believed.   There have also been reports in Spain linking West Ham United with a move for Real Madrid defender Alvaro Arbeloa, but I have been told there is no truth in those rumours.   Read these rumors, didn't bother to post them due to them being unbelievable."
Hammers,3ce2fy,greg19735,5,Tue Jul 7 04:48:25 2015 UTC,"Jenkinson, almost certainly   Agreed. He's surely on holiday after his U21 stuff. And Song was recently training with us so he's unlikely to be on holiday."

He's only waiting for the right offer. Crystal Palace, 10th from last in the Premiership, have offered 14m Euro to PSG for his services. However, Yohan Cabaye would prefer to take those services elsewhere, to West Ham for example. The club has recently made inquiries to PSG.""  Original:  ""Cabaye penche vers West Ham.

If his future is fluid, then one thing is sure: Yohan Cabaye will rejoin the Premier League this summer -- only 1 year after departing Newcastle for PSG. Even if Crystal Palace, where Cabaye's old manager with the Magpies--Pardew--is now in charge, have made an offer of 14m Euro, the 29 year-old has made his desire to play for someone else clear.  In essence, given the information from Le Parisien, Cabaye wishes to join a more prestigious club than Crystal Palace, namely West Ham. He would rejoin an old Ligue 1 teammate, Dimitri Payet, from LOSC in 2011.  As a small anecdote, Cabaye actually scored his first two Premier League goals with Newcastle against West Ham on January 18, 2014.""  Original:  ""Si Crystal Palace aurait formulé une offre pour le milieu de terrain du PSG, Yohan Cabaye, ce dernier aurait donné sa préférence à un autre club de Premier League, West Ham.  Si l'identité de son futur club est encore floue, une chose est sure, Yohan Cabaye va rejoindre la Premier League cet été, seulement 1 an et demi après avoir quitté Newcastle pour rejoindre le Paris Saint-Germain. Si Crystal Palace, où Cabaye retrouverait son ancien technicien chez les Magpies, Alan Pardew, aurait formulé une offre de 14 millions d'euros, le milieu de 29 ans aurait un penchant pour une autre destination.  En effet, selon les informations du quotidien Le Parisien, Yohan Cabaye souhaiterait rejoindre un club un peu plus huppé que Crystal Palace, West Ham. Il rejoindrait ainsi un ancien pensionnaire de Ligue 1, dont il a croisé le chemin au LOSC en juin 2011, Dimitri Payet.  Pour la petite anecdote, les deux derniers buts de Yohan Cabaye en Premier League sous le maillot de Newcastle ont été inscrits face à ... West Ham, le 18 janvier 2014."""

I share the same concerns though, can't help but feel like he's about one more major injury away from retirement.  I fear if he gets another knee or ankle injury he'll take a long look at his career and say the game is not worth it.  He's made his money and if he decided to call it quits and I can't say I'd completely blame him, with his injury record the man may not be able to walk by the time he's 50."

Hammers,3cbq3x,Runofthedill,8,Mon Jul 6 17:52:14 2015 UTC,I just don't see us being all that close to getting Austin or Remy. Chelsea said Remy wasn't for sale and I think everyone is waiting for Austin's price to drop.  Maybe Destro on a loan deal?

I think Song and Jenkinson are 2 of those names but who knows who the 3rd could be. Ogbonna, and Cabaye are both being thrown around but something I've noticed is that we haven't gone after any lower league players like we did last season and Sullivan hasn't brought in any of his trademark South Americans so the 3rd name could be somewhat of a surprise."

A few posters asked that I update the board whenever Lletget does something noteworthy. I don't think anyone expected him to score 5 times in his first 7 games.  He is above the MLS standard. It is pretty obvious when you watch him play. It really makes Sam look foolish, because we easily could have loaned him to a Championship side for a season to develop, and he could be making an impact at the club right now."
Hammers,3c63gg,dkcork,5,Sun Jul 5 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"It's alright dude, I'm mostly just winding you up. We probably shouldve loaned him out alright but he's gone now so we just gotta move past Sams mistakes and hope Bilic helps the youth players along better than BFS ever did."
Hammers,3c63gg,Cmoore4099,0,Sun Jul 5 20:25:08 2015 UTC,Nah he wouldnt. He might against an Andorran team but is no where near Premier League level. I watched him a decent but of the years and he was never going to get into our first team. Remember he's 22 and I don't think he will progress much further. Is he above mls level? Maybe but I don't think he is going to be a superstar.   Edit: not speaking ill of the MLS but remember Bradley Wright-Phillips was the leagues top scorer last season with Henry putting the ball in. Imagine him in a Prem squad. It would be a diaster.
Hammers,3c63gg,Cmoore4099,2,Mon Jul 6 12:45:19 2015 UTC,Remember he's 22   When Cresswell was 22 he was playing for fucking Tranmere. Or is that different?
Hammers,3c63gg,Cmoore4099,0,Mon Jul 6 14:24:59 2015 UTC,"I think it is. I think that most people don't really trust the management of a club, at the end of the day they see these players day in and day out. Cressy was playing well with Tranmere and that secured him a move by the time he was 22/23 to Ipswich to play in the championship. He was playing in the first team at both clubs.   I mean at the end of the day there is a reason he never went out on loan at our club, could be a visa issue. I think one of his parents is English so it shouldn't have been. I doubt the club would stop you if you asked to go on loan. Maybe there wasn't interest. Just saying that the lad has come on great for Galaxy, thats amazing. However, from what I have seen of him, heard about him, he was never going to make the first team.   I mean it is just how it is. Frank Nouble, Elliot Ward, and Jordan Spence, weren't going to make the first team either. I would have Spence in the MLS in a heartbeat. He was my personal favorite from those boys but it wasn't meant to be."
Hammers,3c63gg,N0rrinRadd,2,Mon Jul 6 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"But you're losing it if you think playing (and starring) in MLS at 22 is less impressive than playing (and starring) at Tranmere at the same age. The entire point I was making was that a player at that age succeeding at that level isn't ""the best their going to get"" and we've seen that time and time again. Christ, Charlie Austin was a part-time brick layer at 22.  Also: His parents are both Argentinian immigrants (to America) of Italian descent. He trained with the first team under Zola. Got dropped into the reserves when Big Sam got here and got exactly one crack at the top flight before getting unceremoniously shipped off."
Hammers,3c63gg,h18dalton,0,Mon Jul 6 17:30:19 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it anymore or less impressive at all. I am just saying from the 2-3 times I have seen him in the flesh and the coaches and scouts I have spoke to him he didn't have what it takes at the first division in England. I mean Wrighty didn't play professionally till 21. We can go on and on with players that didn't play to their full potential by 21/22. No player does honestly.
Hammers,3c63gg,The_Sliver_Hammer,3,Mon Jul 6 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"Galaxy season ticket holder here. I've got to say this about the lad, he's a fucking STUD. He's scored in damn near all of his games. He bodies his way through men like the Koolaid man through brickwalls. That last goal tonight in the 94th minute was sweet fucking cream in the top right corner. I'm so glad him and Nacho are getting on. CBass is the real fooking deal on any team. He's a joy to watch."

If they write something good, I allow it.  Part of the fizzling out is that the entire group got banned from /r/soccer so they're putting less effort into it."
Hammers,3c21wq,AnalAttackProbe,3,Sat Jul 4 02:57:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. Great content.
Hammers,3c21wq,You_Got_The_Touch,2,Sat Jul 4 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"I think that the comment about the possibility of having a bad run at the start of the season was interesting.  Difficult away games, and the potential for upsets in the 'easy' games could give us a rough start.  It's important not to turn on Bilic too quickly if that does happen."
Hammers,3c21wq,DirtD4er,4,Sat Jul 4 11:29:10 2015 UTC,"they made the point that i'm onside with aswell though, that we'll have had months of competitive fixtures by then to get our form together and the league will still be in silly season. probably never going to have a better chance of taking something from those three away fixtures.  worked out pretty well for us to be honest. winnable home games, away games that we expect nothing from that we'll be going into with an advantage and a relatively quiet christmas."
Hammers,3c21wq,WeirdSailboat,2,Sat Jul 4 11:47:46 2015 UTC,"It's important not to turn on Bilic too quickly if that does happen.   Even if we lost all of those games, I think Bilic will still get time to turn it around from the Daves, and with the talent available he would.  I think keeping Allardyce for as long as we did shows that the Daves are patient with managers, even when they underachieve, and piss off the fans.  Even if Bilic has a slow start I don't doubt he'll get a fair shot, and be able to win the fans back around."
Hammers,3c21wq,The_Sliver_Hammer,2,Mon Jul 6 17:10:03 2015 UTC,This is wonderful!
Hammers,3c1fot,Wookie301,10,Fri Jul 3 21:50:40 2015 UTC,What point did it happen? Micky Flanagan is such a wank I can't bear to sit through it.
Hammers,3c1fot,sexdrugsncarltoncole,4,Sat Jul 4 01:12:15 2015 UTC,"Micky Flanagan, James Corden & Jack Whitehall are the only three good reasons I need not to watch this show."
Hammers,3c1fot,wanktarded,3,Sat Jul 4 09:34:18 2015 UTC,pretty much the last segment
Hammers,3c1fot,appleman94,2,Sat Jul 4 01:15:45 2015 UTC,Right at the end of the video. Maybe a minute before.
Hammers,3c1fot,appleman94,11,Sat Jul 4 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"can we not vilify Kevin Nolan over an episode of a league of their own please, the entire show is set up to make fools out of the people that appear on it. Also worth noting he was hanging over a dunk tank having balls pelted at him."
Hammers,3c1fot,I_tend_to_correct_u,5,Sat Jul 4 00:32:02 2015 UTC,I'm not vilifying him in the slightest. I'm aware of the shows purpose. I do watch it. I just thought it was funny and worth sharing. Not like there's any news to report.
Hammers,3c1fot,appleman94,5,Sat Jul 4 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"Come on, all Hammers respect our Kev, he led from the front but his time is past and we are allowed to take the piss ffs."

Hammers,3c1fot,Mr_Vantastic,4,Sat Jul 4 19:41:39 2015 UTC,He's played for bloody two of them as well
Hammers,3c1fot,wanktarded,5,Fri Jul 3 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"I could name 3 of Derby's managers right off that bat if asked. And I can't ever remember a time in my life where I gave the slightest shit about Derby. You'd think as team captain, you'd know enough of the club's history to be able to name 3 managers.  Although looking back to be fair, he was getting balls kicked at him while thinking."
Hammers,3c1fot,Mr_Vantastic,5,Fri Jul 3 22:20:14 2015 UTC,Is the guy who was ragging on west ham at the beginning a comedian? Was some pretty funny stuff. Also how old is this?
Hammers,3c1fot,appleman94,4,Sat Jul 4 01:15:32 2015 UTC,It's from today. And yes he's a comedian. Jack Whitehall.
Hammers,3c1fot,youtubefactsbot,8,Sat Jul 4 01:35:43 2015 UTC,And yes he's a comedian. Jack Whitehall.   I've yet to see proof of this.
Hammers,3c09x2,AnalAttackProbe,7,Fri Jul 3 16:28:03 2015 UTC,Isn't Al Jazira a TV company?
Hammers,3c09x2,CarltonFuckingCole,10,Fri Jul 3 16:42:03 2015 UTC,That's Al Jazeera. I don't know how you could ever confuse the two...
Hammers,3c09x2,kappafox,2,Fri Jul 3 16:49:59 2015 UTC,I remember him being pretty good in Argentina about a year ago. There was even talk about him being brought to Tigres of Liga MX and even European teams were linked with him. How is he doing now?
Hammers,3c09x2,heytterebea,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:32:30 2015 UTC,also beşiktaş wanted him when bilic was still in charge.
Hammers,3c09x2,DV23,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:10:34 2015 UTC,"Seems like a replacement if Downing were to leave. Young, creative and on loan with an option to buy, seems like a no brainer."

Hammers,3bzf83,drmrspkds,17,Fri Jul 3 12:03:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm seconding /u/drmrspkds   As funny and interesting as Reddit imploding is. Fuck it. We're here to talk West Ham. I feel like the Sports subreddits are kinda seperate from the shitshow that is the rest of Reddit.
Hammers,3bzf83,aoeuisnthd,13,Fri Jul 3 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the rest of reddit is generally a cesspool in my opinion.  At least around here, we do not concern ourselves with bullshit that doesn't matter.  On more important news, I have to go see a doctor after Sakho's brace yesterday.  Apparently if it doesn't go away in about four hours, you should be a bit concerned?"
Hammers,3bzf83,DRxGlass,3,Fri Jul 3 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Thank you. I appreciate that we can still visit our sub where we talk about the hammers. I don't see a reason to go crazy and break shit because reddit screwed up and fired someone. Reddit will suffer for its mistakes in the way of having less interactions with the celebrities that AMA brought in, that will be enough to show them they fucked up."
Hammers,3bzf83,dkcork,6,Fri Jul 3 20:24:10 2015 UTC,Proper order! We've things to discuss here with transfers and Europa league etc.

Hammers,3bzf83,tyler3794,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:48:10 2015 UTC,Good. The rest of the drama is stupid we don't need to get involved
Hammers,3bzf83,DoubleTeam,18,Fri Jul 3 21:55:38 2015 UTC,I'm sure the mods are quaking in their boots just thinking about our mighty and influential subreddit being closed
Hammers,3bzf83,Nexg3nz13,4,Fri Jul 3 11:56:06 2015 UTC,There are subs with far less readers than this that have been shut down..
Hammers,3bzf83,errboi,8,Fri Jul 3 12:02:31 2015 UTC,Who gives a shit. Really. So someone got fired. Big deal. They closed a bunch of subreddits and reddit freaked out for 2 days then it all went away and no one brings it up. It will all blow over soon as the Internet has the attention span of a small child. All of them will unprivate eventually and everything will go back to normal.
Hammers,3bzf83,aoeuisnthd,10,Fri Jul 3 12:38:52 2015 UTC,"They fired the most liked reddit employee, Victoria is one of the reasons this site has got a lot of famous people doing ""iAmA"". It's a shame that there are a lot of people non caring.."
Hammers,3bzf83,Nexg3nz13,4,Fri Jul 3 12:44:32 2015 UTC,"Reddit is weird. It's a corporation and a community, and the corporation is shit at communicating with the community while the community is super shitty back to the corporation over every slight (perceived and real). It's pretty much every dysfunctional, codependent relationship ever, but on a huge scale and in internet form."
Hammers,3bzf83,trevorsmith_92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:00:54 2015 UTC,This is an underappreciated insight.
Hammers,3bzf83,duckandweave,-5,Sat Jul 4 00:49:51 2015 UTC,Eh. I've read maybe one iAmA in my life. Not something I am really interested in. People get fired from jobs every single day it's life it happens. I am liked by all of my friends and they wouldn't riot if I lost my job. People will get over it in time. Reddit will still continue to get a lot of famous iAmA's because celebs know it's good publicity. It won't matter that she was let go in the long run. She will find a new job. Life will go on. Simple as that.
Hammers,3bzf83,Nexg3nz13,10,Fri Jul 3 12:53:09 2015 UTC,"For what its worth, the subs making a stand is what is great about reddit - it's a community - whereas the way they have treated her is reflective of how reddit is going down hill imo"
Hammers,3bzf83,Arizona-Bay,2,Fri Jul 3 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"does anyone know why she was sacked tho? maybe she punched her boss in the mouth or something, then fair play. its all well and good being a community and supporting each other, but I've not seen any reasoning as to why she was sacked. If she was sacked on the spot for nothing I'm sure she'll do them for unfair dismissal anyway."
Hammers,3bzf83,youstank,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:48:27 2015 UTC,Well the community is loving being able to post more General Pao pictures or equating Nazi's to the reddit admins. Very stupid and childish. Like I said I've already seen a number of subs I follow that were dark and now aren't because they realize how dumb this all is. If people don't like reddit then don't use it. But for what I use it for I'll continue to because none of what the Admins have done has effected my life in any way.
Hammers,3bzf83,endofautumn,6,Fri Jul 3 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"The reason they're protesting isn't just because someone got fired, its because   They fired her with no notice at all, which fucked up upcoming AMAs Apparently, communication between the admins and mod teams has deteriorated severely in recent months Moderation tools aren't as good as they should be"

Hammers,3bz0h9,DoubleTeam,10,Fri Jul 3 08:27:04 2015 UTC,Every day on the BBC:  a negative Hammers headline. Its almost as if a spurs fan were running the football page.
Hammers,3bz0h9,mtptr,4,Fri Jul 3 09:49:25 2015 UTC,was waiting for them to shoehorn the Olympic Stadium deal 'travesty' in there somehow
Hammers,3bz0h9,mtptr,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:04 2015 UTC,Exactly!  It's almost every day at the moment.  I know it's the close season but there has to be more to report!
Hammers,3bz0h9,Bobbyc006,6,Fri Jul 3 13:50:48 2015 UTC,He was never going to be in charge of the team though right? I thought that was made clear well in advance
Hammers,3bz0h9,Superfastninja,4,Fri Jul 3 10:15:44 2015 UTC,I am seeing the same bullshit articles over here (Norway) clearly it's just to get clicks on the article.
Hammers,3bz0h9,psychomaji,3,Fri Jul 3 08:53:38 2015 UTC,What a load of bull
Hammers,3bz0h9,wanktarded,3,Fri Jul 3 08:48:17 2015 UTC,"So if he'd taken charge he'd have been showing disrespect to Terry, what a fucking ridiculous non article. Not having a go at the OP, but at the BBC!"
Hammers,3bz0h9,savop31,3,Fri Jul 3 11:06:49 2015 UTC,I'd love us to put out the complete first team next week and see how many we could score at their cow pasture of a pitch. Fuck off.

Hammers,3bz0sv,winterjoey,7,Fri Jul 3 08:30:53 2015 UTC,It's a shame they weren't a but more sporting. They could of had the whole stadium on their side when they were 3-0 down. I did like the booing of our team when we took the ball off of them. Love a bit of West Ham humour
Hammers,3bz0sv,aLittleBitHalfCaste,4,Fri Jul 3 11:03:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely. If they weren't so focused on rolling around and bringing out the stretcher twice for nothing, they would've gained our support. Shame for them, they could've left feeling brave rather than embarrassed."
Hammers,3bz0sv,I_tend_to_correct_u,5,Fri Jul 3 11:20:34 2015 UTC,"Actually the second one happened right in front of me and it looked seriously painful. His neck jarred at a weird angle and I've had that happen and it's a weird mix of pain and feeling like you're going to black out. Felt sorry for the guy. He spends all day every day peeling potatoes or something then has to perform in front of 35,000 baying fans who are mocking him for being hurt. I'm all for it when they're pros but being only ten yards away I could see the tears in his eyes."
Hammers,3bz0sv,randiebarsteward,5,Fri Jul 3 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really think the numbers matter, I can't imagine the sense of occasion those players must have felt playing at a venue with so many fans.  Must have felt awe inspiring."
Hammers,3bz0sv,Kubrickhammer,4,Fri Jul 3 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"Best moment of the match was the Lusitans centre-forward walking over to the away end at the final whistle and applauding, clearly with no idea where the few fans were sitting."
Hammers,3bxbmk,TrashHawk,13,Thu Jul 2 22:40:55 2015 UTC,"Ballboy was the highlight, the mood has lifted. Call me a cunt but shit not being able to have a quick booze at half time. Enjoyed giving the keeper stick he couldn't hack it"

Hammers,3bxbmk,brenman,3,Fri Jul 3 00:23:33 2015 UTC,What I heard at the ground was UEFA regs didn't allow it. Bit of a shitter but didn't harm a good night out in the sun

Used to be a ST in the Centenary/STB lower next to the away support which is always good, East Stand near the away too always sounds good, but spent last night in the West/Betway upper and it was quiet. Few laughs but quiet."
Hammers,3bxbmk,jayayseekay,2,Fri Jul 3 08:38:37 2015 UTC,"I was Betway Lower. Hate having to sit and watch the match, much prefer standing in the Bobby Moore Lower.

Hammers,3bxbmk,WestHamBellend,2,Fri Jul 3 09:33:07 2015 UTC,I got in early and got my season ticket in there so I was happy enough but there were a lot of new faces where I guess the regulars were on holiday
Hammers,3bxbmk,Bobbyc006,2,Fri Jul 3 10:13:59 2015 UTC,Think that's often the case. Me and my mates have season tickets in the Bobby Moore lower but left it too late to get tickets for last night so ended up in the Betway. Always seems to be new people for cup games. Where in the BML are you?
Hammers,3bxbmk,WestHamBellend,2,Fri Jul 3 10:17:22 2015 UTC,Back right looking at the goal
Hammers,3bxkox,olympuse410,8,Thu Jul 2 23:59:34 2015 UTC,Toby King (the ball boy) is U14 this season I believe.

That 2nd goal... great one touch play on the edge of the box between Zarate & Amalfitano(?), excellent positional play by Sakho & also great to see Zarate chasing into the box looking for the return pass. Great goal all round."

Hammers,3bwuyt,kmurp62rulz,2,Fri Jul 3 05:43:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the gifs! Botway must be a synonym for clarity.
Hammers,3bwuyt,WeirdSailboat,2,Thu Jul 2 23:48:25 2015 UTC,"If you can't see it, you can't prove it happened, and we won't pay out."
Hammers,3bwwi3,AnalAttackProbe,16,Thu Jul 2 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"Really glad to see players who are gonna be on the edges of the first team like Jarvis and Zarate giving strong performances. Sure it's weak opposition, but knowing that these players can come in if there's injuries to our first team is good, it feels like a long time since we've had a deep squad.  Also, Diafra Sakho is now the top goalscorer in all competitions for Premier League players"
Hammers,3bwwi3,Ervin_Pepper,5,Thu Jul 2 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Diafra Sakho is now the top goalscorer in all competitions for Premier League players   haha, good stat!  Let's see if he can keep it up :D"
Hammers,3bwwi3,madjoy,7,Thu Jul 2 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"Apart from the major motion sickness, things weren't bad at all. Started off shaky, with Poyet and Sakho playing poorly, but they turned it around. I was impressed by Jarvis, you can tell he's been working hard. Tomkins was a master and Joey wasn't too bad.   Good to see youngsters get some playing time as well. Oxford was definitely trying to impress and he made some poor decisions at first, but he looked solid for the most part. I think Page impressed me the most out of all the youth.   All-in-all, good game."
Hammers,3bwwi3,kappafox,4,Thu Jul 2 20:44:06 2015 UTC,Apart from the major motion sickness   Started off shaky   I see what you did there...
Hammers,3bwwi3,kappafox,2,Thu Jul 2 20:52:29 2015 UTC,Totally on purpose.
Hammers,3bwwi3,grelch,7,Thu Jul 2 21:42:49 2015 UTC,Training exercise. Nobody injured. Youngsters get to play. Bench players get to play. Easy win on 10 days training.We get to send the Academy to Andorra. There's no reason to be unhappy. Happy days.
Hammers,3bwwi3,NotGoodAtUser-Names,4,Thu Jul 2 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"Jarvis played well which made me happy because I have a soft spot for him. Hopefully he gets more of a chance to play this season. Sakho was awesome as always. Zarate played well even when Lusitans were throwing themselves at him everytime he got the ball. The young players did well, very composed despite a few small mistakes. It was a good performance and I hope it continues."
Hammers,3bwwi3,Bobbyc006,4,Thu Jul 2 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"Biggest plus point was Reece Oxford's performance he looks class. I'm not saying he will ever be as good as them but he reminded me of Rio or Lampard with his composure on the ball, not phased at all"
Hammers,3bwwi3,Arizona-Bay,3,Thu Jul 2 22:58:00 2015 UTC,Would have been nice to see more goals but we played well and it was good to see a lot of young players in action. Can't wait for the second leg.
Hammers,3bwwi3,Runofthedill,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:42:39 2015 UTC,Be interested in who we do end up sending. I'd assume Lee will start up front and possibly send Jarvis.
Hammers,3bwwi3,ThisAccountIsAVirus,3,Fri Jul 3 01:05:04 2015 UTC,Couple of questions from a guy who will hopefully get to watch the game later.  What was the formation?  How did the youngsters play?  MotM?
Hammers,3bwwi3,ThisAccountIsAVirus,3,Thu Jul 2 20:45:19 2015 UTC,"Formation was a 4-4-2 Bucket with 2 DMs and 2 wingers.  Youngsters looked good! Really the only player I was disappointed in was Poyet, who didn't play poorly, but just didn't look as good as some of the other players.  MotM I'd say was Zarate or Sakho."
Hammers,3bwwi3,ThisAccountIsAVirus,3,Thu Jul 2 20:53:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't sure if it was that or a 4-2-3-1 with Zarate in the hole and Sakho alone up top.  Poyet is kind of what I gathered from twitter he and Oxford were in each other's way a lot from the sound of it. Second half they said he played a lot better. I think Poyet is suffering because he didn't get a holiday at all really.
Hammers,3bwwi3,madjoy,2,Thu Jul 2 21:04:45 2015 UTC,Zarate started up top but dropped into midfield to receive the ball pretty often. The formation was pretty fluid though.
Hammers,3bwwi3,DrRobotTheRobotDr,2,Thu Jul 2 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info mate, cannot wait to watch it in like 3 hours."
Hammers,3bwwi3,Jonahb360,3,Thu Jul 2 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"Never since I started watching West Ham have I seen us win by 4 goals or more and I was kinda hoping today would be that day (SMASH!!) but oh well.  but really good to see good performances from Sakho (back to his goalscoring ways), Zarate, and Jarvis.  Not a bad captaining debut from Tomkins  Oxford and Cullen impressed me the most of the youth players on the pitch.  I'd like to see Cullen given some more game time on the basis of this match!!  Feel great about this season and pumped for a good year!  COYI!!!"

Hammers,3bwwi3,Teakz,6,Thu Jul 2 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"It was basically a pre-season friendly, I think 3-0 is okay for the amount of youth that was played. I mean they didn't have one shot on target, and it's pretty hard to break down 11 men, no matter what level they play at imo."
Hammers,3bwwi3,DrRobotTheRobotDr,3,Thu Jul 2 20:43:43 2015 UTC,guess im just mad since i could have won like a 100 bucks if we scored one more goal.

Final 25minutes just seemed to be played in one minute periods broken up by a Lusitanos cramp. Think that all we should've been looking for today, considering the lads have not long got back from their holidays, was a result that effectively ends the tie and we got that.

She had gotten me the one from the previous season but her wires crossed and she got me an XL.  This time around she swore she got it right and ordered me a medium after I told her Adidas runs a bit small. Well I unwrap my kit on Christmas morning, throw it on and the thing was slim as fuck. I looked like a fucking sausage.   I used it a few times but not as many as she would have liked. It sits in the closet now and it's such a shame. Can't even sell it because then I'd feel really bad."
Hammers,3bvmn0,kappafox,9,Thu Jul 2 15:33:18 2015 UTC,Lose some weight. Then she'll like you for wearing the kit AND being thinner!
Hammers,3bvmn0,gonewiththewinds,3,Thu Jul 2 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"I want to agree with you but then again, Adidas kits are impossibly small. I wear small sizes always, used to be a size 29 pant and I went up to 30 about a year ago. I'm just glad we have Umbro again."

It feels alot bigger than the last one, for me personally the width is alot better than the adidas kit, which was slim. However it is quite long, feels like a few more inches and it would look like I was wearing a nighty, so you may be able drop a size if you want it to fit similarly to the adidas kit. Best bet is to try it on in a store if that is an option."
Hammers,3bvmn0,Timedbump,2,Thu Jul 2 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"I'm in the states thats why I'm asking. I have a small in the Adidas kit from 2 years ago and I'm ok with the fit. Sounds like I should stay with that size in the new kit. Thanks for the info, mate!"

Hammers,3buu1t,wheepete,3,Thu Jul 2 12:19:31 2015 UTC,"We'll score 8 at least. This is not a david vs goliath game. It's much, much worse.   Lustianos would not even be at Conference North/South level, and they are taking on 8 premier league caliber players and three hot prospects from one of the best youth development clubs in the world. Lustianos last played in front of 50, West Ham last played in front of 50k, with at least 5 million more watching around the world.  Keep in mind the last time Lustianos played in Europe they were flogged on aggregate by a team from the Faroe Islands. They lost to a small club from a country with fewer citizens than seats in the Olympic Stadium. And Andorra itself only has 85 thousand people."
