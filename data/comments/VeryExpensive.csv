That's under $150 to make a clip (probably much less)  gives you $2550 profit per clip.  2x a day makes you around $1,861,500 a year.

Corporations have taken the confederate flag off the shelves because they care what ostensibly rich people do with their money.  Everyone should care about how everyone else is spending money.   Money is a place holder for force. To spend money, is to impart force upon the world towards whatever it is that you bought.  Whenever anyone has a lot of money, that is force, you absolutely should care what they use that money, force, on.  The US government retains total control of our monetary supply, because, they have a monopoly on force, and we have determined that with this power, they should be subjected to the oversight of every single voter.  Rich people have no such oversight. Given that their money, or force, is 1000s of times a common man, what they spend it on should be scrutinized, given that they are under no oversight. Normal people aren't given this level of scrutinization usually because their individual purchases are immaterial. It only matters if they act in groups, such as buying racist paraphernalia, that we should care."
VeryExpensive,3baj03,confluencer,5,Sat Jun 27 18:25:35 2015 UTC,"That is a very interesting perspective. But at what point do you draw the line on ""rich"" and what is ""wasteful""? What if they spent $500 million on an art piece? Obviously you would say they are wasting their money and should not be able to do that. They would be wasting the goods and services that could be invested in improving the lives and prosperity of an incredible amount of people for generations. This is the downfall of capitalism you would say, this is why trillion dollar corporations should be run by the government and profits given back to the people. Unfortunately history has made clear that some form of capitalism is still necessary, people won't risk money, or time without the promise of returns.  The increase in ""wasteful"" spending of the rich is a byproduct of what I would call a stagnation of human economic development. The middle class is running out of industries to work in, higher education is over saturated and all that's left are minimum wage jobs soon to be replaced when machines become cheaper than people. Machines have improved the productivity of the human race farther than we have ever been, so why aren't we the richest we've ever been? Well the people that own the machines, the land, the corporations, now pay lower wages to less people because if they don't someone else will. The rich are forced by capitalism to treat the poor like shit, so what are we to do in this time of unprecedented prosperity? I'd go into this more but I don't think anyone will read it soooo...

Each of those feathers has to hand-stitched in place to fabric that is itself hand-stitched together.  The birds aren't endangered. You can find discarded feathers on the ground anywhere a group of peacocks gathers. I doubt that these feathers were gathered so humanely. You'd have to pay for the flock, the hunter/butcher, and for whatever number of extra feathers/peacocks you'd need to replace any damaged ones.  Lastly, the cost of making a prototype or a one-of-a-kind thing is always expensive, if it's the first time you're making it. The costs of running an atelier to make one dress vs. spreading the cost of labor over making multiple dresses drives up the price."

VeryExpensive,3afjot,0100101010110,-17,Mon Jun 22 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculous. Nobody on earth should be able to have the purchasing power to possess something so expensive and pointless.   Think of everything you could do with 70 million dollars. And here is a ring so that someone can showoff how rich they are that they have this ridiculously expensive ring, which will impress some of their idiot rich friends, but will appear to anyone with any sense like they are simply fools with too much money."
VeryExpensive,3afjot,Akoustyk,10,Fri Jun 19 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"Classic poor people talk. ..............    Joking  In all seriousness,  do you think they buy these thing as investments?  Surely they don't actually wear it. ..."
VeryExpensive,3afjot,rimfirekyle,-8,Fri Jun 19 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"No, I doubt it. It's tough to make an investment on something like that. It's such a useless item with such a high value, that you are really banking on there being many more ridiculously rich people existing that want a ridiculously expensive ring for their collection.   They might wear it once or twice, but really it's just to showoff to people at what they have. It's just to have it. It makes no sense.   There is maybe some value in it as for the crafstmanship, which at least is a little sensible as a piece of art, but still, a lot of that value comes simply because it is a diamond. Which is just a really hard and shiny piece of stone, or mineral, or carbon.   Obviously, I can't afford a 70 million$ diamond ring, but even if I could, there's no way in hell I would spend that. Only an unimaginative fool would do that. You can create so much with 70 million$ you could start a new company from scratch easily. So many better ways to invest money. It's just stupid. Something Donald Trump would buy, or some filthy rich oil tycoon in middle east. I could never respect anyone that bought that. They would just be to me, an idiot with too much money, and I would be annoyed that they have so much money and are wasting it on dumb shit, when the world is in the state that it's in.   Someone that spends 6 million on a car is bad enough. But at least it serves a purpose, and that money went towards make it functional at very high spec. But this is 70 million, 70 million on a ring, that doesn't do anything except be a ring. This entire house is 70 million$. Dr Dre's mansion in only 40 million$.   Think of everything you could buy for 70 million$, and try to find a stupider way to spend it than on a ring. I mean, 70 million$, we could easily be having this conversation for far less than that, a 7 million$ ring, is already stupid."
VeryExpensive,3afjot,Akoustyk,8,Fri Jun 19 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"Who says a person always needs to buy anything useful? We buy so much shit that ultimately has little use. What about a painting such as Picasso's, which was bought for hundreds of millions of dollars? If I had a billion dollars, I would totally buy this ring. It's unique, cool idea, and I think it is gorgeous. A person should be able to buy frivolous things with their own money if they deem it worthy of their money."
VeryExpensive,3afjot,grayk47,6,Fri Jun 19 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"Usually art is bought as a way to stash money. Also, businesses buy art as a  tax write off. It's so much more complicated than any of us plebs even know.  This ring is a way to show off the incredible skill of the jeweler and promote their company's brand. They'll lend it out to celebrities for marketing."
VeryExpensive,3afjot,Rummager,-7,Sat Jun 20 01:27:51 2015 UTC,"People can do whatever they want, but someone that buys this, is an idiot, because they can't find something better to do with 70 million$.   You would lose your billion quickly.   70 million$ is substantial on a world scale. It's the fact that someone would elect to spend so much money on something frivolous that tells me about them.   They can do whatever they want obviously. Stupid people are allowed to do stupid things."

They've got plenty more money so that 70 mil isn't a huge deal. They can do as they please with their money and it doesn't make them idiots.   I can guarantee that the people who have that kind of purchasing power have done more with their time and money for charity / philanthropy in a decade than you'll probably do in your entire lifetime."
VeryExpensive,3afjot,manfly,-3,Sat Jun 20 02:36:40 2015 UTC,"They are still idiots, because that 70 million could still be used for 70 million$ of anything else.   It's 70 million$ of the resources of humanity spent on a useless ring. 70 million$ could significantly change the well being of entire nations.   Or, you could buy a ring.   Obviously, some people have really a lot of money, but entire corporations cost a lot of money. Starting a space faring corporation costs a lot of money.   You are thinking too small, 70 million$ is 70 million$ Their funds are not infinite, it is possible to spend all of their money, if they wanted to."

It the hands of an actual smart person there are no limits to what they can spend money on.   70 million$ won't get you into space, but you could actually start a business with that, which will employ a far greater number of people, and which would be far better for the economy.   70 million$ on a ring, didn't make rich people part with their money, it made one rich person give another rich person some money.

It's just a stupid expenditure of human resources, and people that buy that ring are stupid. I'm just making that statement. Just because a 70 million$ ring is one of the stupidest things anyone could ever buy, that doesn't mean that everything worth 70 million$ is stupid.   Sometimes things are expensive but they are worth the expense. But also, I am not an idiot, so I don't prefer ignorance simply because I don't like things.

They are not rare by any means and there are many other gemstones and elements that are more beautiful than a clear stone that has no intrinsic beauty. All we believe to be true about jewelry today is just a capitalist movement by the De Beers diamond stranglehold from the 30's.

It's the wood that's used, and the rest is how it's made— the shape of the stick, the curvature, the diameter at each point, etc. A really nice bow feels extremely comfortable to use (after getting over the price and not wanting to break it..!) and gives an experience that cannot be given by the average bow."

If government policy was geared toward helping regular folks, we would be suffering a little inflation in groceries, movie tickets, etc.  But they do a very good job making sure the money ends up with the very rich."

VeryExpensive,39b2l2,ThatHurdlesGuy,9,Wed Jun 10 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"There are other beautiful kaya Go boards, but this one is truly unique. Created by master craftsman Shin Myongsik, this board was forged from a single piece of exceptionally rare kaya.  Mr Shin has been making Go boards for 50 years, since he was 12 years old, and is a true master of the craft. According to Mr Shin, kaya of this quality is so rare that a master board maker will only get an opportunity to work with it once in their lifetime, if they're lucky.  Mr Shin spent 20 years carefully drying the wood and lovingly creating this board. The board is famous throughout Asia and has appeared on television numerous times. This is Mr Shin's masterpiece."

VeryExpensive,39b2l2,NosillaWilla,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"Furniture maker reporting in. This price is incredibly stupid. Aside from the beautiful carved feet (I'm guessing mahogany, that is one of the most traditional carving woods) this is just a slab of wood. This did not take 20 years to make. Sure, they might have left the wood to air dry that long but that is just simply leaving it in your shop, barn or somewhere else that's dry for the time to dry. Working by hand might include squaring all sides of it, but I honestly don't see where the 100k figure goes. If I could make similar pieces and sell hunks of wood for 100k, I wouldn't be making tables, dressers, chairs and kitchen cabinetry. If you list something pretentiously high, do you think someone would be more inclined to buy it who had the money? Maybe I'm doing my marketing all wrong..."

(not $50m though)  One is super cool, pretty much jet sets and travels but is somehow down to earth.  The other is the biggest piece of shit I've ever met, and she hates the fact that she has nothing to complain about.  She's black, lesbian, female, and pretty overweight but has a lifelong trustfund.  She accuses others of being racist/homophobic/fat hating/sexist when in reality she's the most racist person I've ever met.  She carries a gun with her at all times because she thinks people hate her for what she is, when in reality it's Who she is."
