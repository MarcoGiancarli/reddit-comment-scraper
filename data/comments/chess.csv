chess,3e24ik,gad-gada,3,Tue Jul 21 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"I think in some ways these bongcloud/fried fox/Barnes/whatever openings are better than some dubious gambits, because they don't lose material. You give up some tempi and put your king in some danger, but if you can keep the position somewhat closed until the king is safe and your pieces are developed, it's not so simple for the opponent to punish it. Plus you put the opponent under a lot of pressure because nobody wants to draw against such an opening, so they might overpress instead and lose the game."

FICS would probably be a similar number.  Chess.com, Playchess and ICC probably 2x-3x LiChess's number.   There are probably a multitude of other smaller chess servers with a combined games played about 2x of LiChess's number.   It would be tough to estimate the number of OTB games worldwide in a single day.  Since you're looking to explore all possible legal positions, a lot of the obscure positions could be played by little kids essentially making random moves.  So tournament games, club games, games in the park, games with friends, parents, siblings...all would count.  Then you need to factor in the countless computer vs computer games being played all the time.    It's wager there's probably something in the neighborhood of 2-4 million games played in a day.  I'd say at least 80-90% produce unique positions.  Games that end to early opening traps will not be unique and I'd say 10-20% of games would end that way."

What is the queen doing there? 14...Re8 is the obvious move afterward and even if a tactic wasn't there, your queen is going to be uncomfortable facing the rook.  Was the plan Qe2 followed by Rd1?  The computer gives 14. Ng6 instead (or the knight somewhere else because the tactical threat is f4 -- pawn fork or dislodging the e5 knight), but even without tactics/combinations, 14.

As black, I enjoy playing positions out of the Benko/Blumenfeld and Benoni because black can gain the initiative with a pawn break on f5 or b5; additionally, he can create an excellent outpost on d3 after c4 is played, and in general has straightforward development, more so than white, it seems.   How can I achieve similar structures and motifs if my opponent plays 1. e4 instead?"
chess,3dxuri,Prasaadh27,16,Tue Jul 21 07:24:33 2015 UTC,"A bit similar pawn structure may occur in Dragon variation of Sicilian defense. There's variation where Black sacrifices a pawn by playing b5 - then you have a nice attack over the open files on the queen-side. It's even better for you compared to Benko, because this time you attack the king!  That said, I would NOT recommend that you stuck in 1 type of position. It would be better for your chess development if you various skills."

What is the main distinction between NMs and higher titled players?  Do you believe that chess is becoming overwrought with theory and memorization?
chess,3dxuri,Iplaychesssometimes,19,Tue Jul 21 06:23:38 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of adults who progressed greatly. This is a myth that only kids have huge potential for progress. Actully, it takes some days to teach a kid how to play chess (how pieces move etc), while an adult can learn it in 1 go :)  Higher level players have more comprehensive knowledge about chess while NMs are usually ""specialized"" in some areas only.   Theory becomes extensive, that's true. However, this is a problem for IM/GM level. In the games of club players things are much easier: the result is often determined by a blunder."

Is there a good way to avoid the Colle after 1.d4 Nf6, 2.Nf3 e6, 3.e3?"
chess,3dxuri,jhec,8,Mon Jul 20 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Colle is not that powerful, there's no real reason to be afraid of it.  If you are sure your opponent is going to play Colle (because he always does so) you may play 2...d5. Then after 3.e3 you don't have to close your light-squared bishop but can develop it actively (to f5/g4) - then Black has no problems whatsoever."

chess,3dxuri,spookyb0ss,6,Mon Jul 20 14:35:50 2015 UTC,"When tactical sacrifices don't work :) Sorry, I'll be more serious.   The key idea is to maintain high ACTIVITY of your forces. Sometimes it requires sacrifices, most often it does not.   For instance, sometimes it may require to sacrifice a pawn to avoid wasting time or moving backward. However, it's not that you think about ""positional sacrifice"", you just keep your activity high."

Korchnoi said something like ""it's funny that I can spend a week analyzing 1 game while for amateurs it takes half an hour"".   To conclude this, play 1 game against computer and spend enough time analyzing it.   If you want to play blitz games, then the real question is: what do you want to train?

chess,3e0138,d_ahura,7,Mon Jul 20 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"Just the fact that you mention an engine is an instant red flag. Working your brain is the key to training your skills. There are well known biases in human thinking that makes having access to 'correct' information a hindrance to actually learning effectively in tests and evaluations.  Besides that when analyzing you should be especially attentive to parts where you make 'obvious' moves. Are they tactically forced, strategically forced, motivated by fear or confidence, have you employed similar ideas? The more you recall and try the more connections you form. From that all the rules you know become more and more qualified and less rules than patterns that might be worth attention.  Finding the correct move or at least a sufficient one can be done in a moment in normal postions. Working out why it is might take a whole lot of time. For example an IQP position might be won if the pawn is on a4, equal if it is on a3 and hopeless if the pawn is on the starting position. I.e. the pattern is the same but details trip you up. Be wary of your insticts and you might find some non obvious critical positions.  There are many technical considerations also. Converting to easily won positions. Stopping counterchances versus gaining more material. Gaining or trading the initiative for compensation ...  All that said you shouldn't feel bad if your analysis time isn't epic when you are relatively new or inexperienced as it is a function of the knowledge you have and your tactical skill. You can only see that you know and practice. The goal of the analysis is to add to your knowledge."

chess,3e0138,d_ahura,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Just out of curiosity, do you not use engines at all when you analyze?  What about more experienced players?  Your method definitely makes sense from the viewpoint of strengthening what I already know, but it seems kind of hard to accumulate new knowledge if I'm only using myself as a resource."
chess,3e0138,pemboo,6,Tue Jul 21 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"I only use an engine fter I'm fairly certain I won't learn more from analyzing. Even then I can take a a day or two of mulling it over and letting it percolate before batching it. There will be some tactical oversights in the analysis and variations but knowing what exactly isn't critical and fixing that is a matter of tactical training and assessment. I'd do a check before posting or publishing a game though.  Only exception to that regimen would be if I sense something amiss or fishy in my opening preparations. Then it might be effective to do some interactive work with an engine and an opening dB to plug that hole.  In a game you are not the only source. You opponent is a critical part. When analyzing you must also criticize and try to improve on his play as thoroughly. What could he have done to stop your ideas or could he have seized the initiative and changed the game. You have a perfet spot there. You know what you wanted to do and hence you can skip the part of figuring that out.  You should turbocharge your learning of chess ideas by studying good chess literature. Be vary of video learning. Most game videos  are terribly superficial and/or regurgitates computer lines and are merely play by play sports commentaries. Video also suffers from being a linear medium while an annotated chess game is a lot of back and forth in a tree of variations and value judgement on specific positions. That is much better navigated in a book, on a board (to use multi channel feedback) or a chess book app."

And if there was a move that I thought might have been better I had no way of playing it out to see if it would have been better.  I had a lot of time to come up with the moves in the game so they were pretty much the best I'm capable of coming up with.  I was able to find my reasoning for playing moves.  Mostly to set up an attacking my position, to keep my opponent from strangling me, stopping my opponents attack, then attempting an attack of my own, after that failed just doing my best to defend.

chess,3dzsxx,sfrums,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. I think another factor is control. Anxiety often stems from a feeling that you lack control. For some people, that means they feel that their life is unmanageable. This is common stress. For others, it has to do with control over what they think or do. This is OCD. I have a phobia of vomiting, and I've always thought of it as a problem with losing control of my body when I throw up, which causes anxiety.  Chess is great because you are in complete control. The rules are defined and rigid. You have perfect information about your opponent's moves. You always have the opportunity to make your own move. In that way, I've found that having control is an escape for me. You put it well when you said that you channel your anxiety into calculation. The fact that you can use your energy in a way that allows you to maintain control of the situation allows you to be free of the negative aspects of anxiety. It really is a wonderful game."

chess,3dzuy3,azlionheart312,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:57 2015 UTC,That's technically hanging a pawn.  A piece would be anything more valuable.  I still laughed though.
chess,3dzuy3,edderiofer,5,Tue Jul 21 03:32:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, piece hanging is ""having one of your pieces inadequately protected, and having insufficient compensation for losing it"".  For example, your queen may be protected by a pawn, say, but your opponent can still capture it with their knight. Then you've hung your queen for a knight."

chess,3e0cgp,echoswolf,4,Mon Jul 20 23:54:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not good enough to give you decent opening advice, but I can't resist commenting- you say you regularly get endgames two pawns down and you blame it on your opening! Do you think Morozevich plays openings that are that bad?    You clearly have found a serious weakness in your game. Your reaction should not be to ignore it, pick an opening that avoids it, and hope nobody ever tosses you out of book."
chess,3e0cgp,tha_real_stabulous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"That's honestly what I thought! That's why I kept with the Chigorin game after game, and assumed I'd mucked up somewhere in the middle-game instead.  I mean, if I play some crazy gambit like the French Wing, and end up pawns down, that's just because the opening's unsound, and I didn't capitalize properly before my opponent got settled.  But the Chigorin's consistently described as ""playable"" - it's not to blame, of itself. But I honestly have about a 50% worse success rate as black when white doesn't play 2.c4. In other openings, against e4 and queen's gambit, I do okay; it's just this one area. The only thing these games definitely have in common is the opening, so I reckon it's got to be that.  Against e4, even with my crazy openings, I can regularly get myself middle- and end-games with decent chances, unless I'm up against top-notch opponents, but I am substantially worse against d4.  Maybe it's that I just don't ""get"" the Chigorin opening, or I've psyched myself out, or I've got some sort of very specific curse. But I've put my work in; opening theory is where I think I excel. I've read Morozevich and Bronznik's books, and used them as reference for correspondence games. But somehow, I end up losing to players hundreds of points lower than me. Unless my opponent elects to play some sort of Colle variation, I've got to the stage that I feel a loss is almost inevitable, unless they blunder badly.  I can only assume it's because it's not ""a good fit"" for me. If it were just because I sucked, then it'd be universal, not one specific corner of my chess games."
chess,3e0cgp,tha_real_stabulous,4,Tue Jul 21 01:31:24 2015 UTC,"To be concise: you're good at your crazy openings and you're bad at calmer positional ones. You can go on a never-ending quest to find more crazy openings or you can try to grow as a player. If you choose the first option, there will always be better prepared opponents who will neutralize your openings.  When you're a GM, play openings that match your strengths. When you're 1500, play openings that match your weaknesses so you get better. I used to have a 100% gambit repertoire like you and it just masked my weaknesses and stunted my growth as a player.  You lose because as soon as you get out of theory, you don't know how to play if you're not swashbuckling sacrificing rooks. That's the problem you need to focus on, not your opening repertoire."

chess,3e0cgp,WP8FTW,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:13 2015 UTC,"Google Henning-Schara gambit, might be something for you.  Trying the Benko is also a solid choice but in case of 2.Nf3 to go 2...c5 and on 3.d5 to 3...b5 anyway. I think Tregubov used to play like this with black (i.e. Benko + this stuff vs Nf3).  For long term I'd personally recommend playing more solid lines."
chess,3e0cgp,tforb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions.  Long term, I'm not so worried about; I'm in a low-level club, and I haven't got much innate talent. I'd rather play exciting games than great games. Case in point - I recently had an awesome game where I managed to sacrifice every single piece... inexplicably, I lost, but not without giving my opponent a hard time. Pretty much everything I play is fundamentally unsound - but over the board, I'm not playing strong enough opposition to worry about that. If I ever get decent opponents, then i will definitely rethink, though.  Benko I've definitely considered, but it doesn't allow for the Albin , which I'm reluctant to give up - it's kinda my pet. But maybe the Albin's unmaintainable.   Henning-Schara just replaces the Albin, though - if White plays 1. d4 2.c4, I have no problems.  Tregubov is an interesting player; I have not come across him before."

chess,3e12z7,fovkeke,2,Tue Jul 21 06:13:06 2015 UTC,"This is without db, just intuition.  First thought: my bishop covers h8 so this looks close to winning for white. In other words black can't just sac his bishop for c pawn and hide with king on h8.  The plan is use king to help c pawn while protecting h pawn with bishop.  Second instant thought: Only black chance is to push f pawn to win h pawn while white king is helping c pawn queen.  So, white bishop belongs on e1-h4 diagonal where it can protect the h pawn while holding down the f pawn march.  EDIT: of course we do not move the bishop from protecting f4 push unless the black is attacking the h4 pawn  Does this work in practice? Yes, Kd6 looks intuitive forcing black bishop to move(and also keeping black king away from c pawn), then we can move the white bishop to e1-h4 diagonal(with Bd2 for example), just in case black decides to attack h4 pawn.  If we do not play Bd2, black can play Kh5 and start marching f pawn.  Just curious why would you as a stronger side offer a draw in this position? There is no risk for white here, did you have a time control with no increment (rare these days).?"
chess,3e12z7,HandsomeGhost,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:46:36 2015 UTC,"Yes I think this is the idea. I came up with the same during the game except I did not think to put my bishop on the e1 h4 diagonal. I set up a plan earlier in the game where my bishop had to get to the diagonal it is already on and I just didn't consider that I now needed to adjust it to a different diagonal. Dumb. I learned one of my endgame weaknesses from this game, though (not willing to consider adjustments to the overall plan often enough), so I consider this a valuable experience."

chess,3dwxsd,MrLegilimens,2,Mon Jul 20 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"11.. bxc5 always consider captures before other moves. In this case, if you take he must recapture with his d pawn since your bishop also covers that square, so he cannot recapture with the queen. Already you should like this since his c pawn is now isolated, and can no longer be protected by other pawns. Now if you look one move further you'll see that you can attack this weak pawn with Ne4 and notice he has no way to defend it. so our thought process is ""look at captures first, identify weakness, attack weakness, can he defend weakness? no. therefore, we win the pawn.""   The close everything up syndrome i've noticed is very common at the beginner level. Sometimes, yes, you want to close things up, but closing things up is extremely committal, you cannot undo these pawn moves. If the tension is acceptable, then maybe you have a more useful move that you can play first, and then if you absolutely must close it up the next turn then fine, do it then. Just don't do it automatically.  20.. Bxc5, this is actually a good move. My intuition would be to take with the knight though to preserve the bishop pair, and also so that after dxc5, Rxc5, The threat Rc1+ is also threatening a discovered attack on his rook from the bishop on f8. The sac really doesn't make much sense unless you play Rxc5 though to target his loose knight on b1. All tactics stem from vulnerabilities in the opponents position. Here his vulnerabilities are that your bishop is lined up with his rook, and his knight on b1 is undefended, plus his kingside is mostly undeveloped, so he cannot castle.  23.. O-O, This is an endgame/queenless middlegame, you have a solid center. your king belongs in the middle. castling is bringing your king further away from where it needs to be. Ke7 serves the double role of keeping your d7 bishop protected. loose pieces tend to drop off, notice how you lost this piece due to his combined threats on a4 and d7? Keep everything defended as much as possible.   After this you just started hanging things, so. I mean. try not to do that, but it was already lost."

chess,3dwg6a,chrisc284,9,Mon Jul 20 02:38:29 2015 UTC,"They are both really good for different reasons.   Chess.com has amazing articles, and a membership is appealing for the exclusive video content. However the layout and graphics are dated IMO, and a lot of features that are free on lichess (tactics, analysis board, computer analysis) cost money, which to me makes any membership except the top tier pointless. Also, you can only access a month's worth of games with a free membership.  As for lichess, it's graphically pleasing. The interface is simple. Amazon's cluttered mess of a website vs Google comes to mind, they just do things simple and it's beautiful as a result. As I mentioned, a lot of free features too. The ""openings"" trainer is really cool. The drawbacks are there currently no articles written by masters or any exclusive content like videos, also the highest number of active users I've seen is 2500, so sometimes it takes a little while to find a game.   I use both a lot actually, although for different reasons. My chess.com account is kind of my throwaway, and I'll play a few games on there before playing on lichess. I know I could just play unrated, but I prefer this for some reason.  As for cheating, I don't know for sure if other people use engines, but I think they both would do a good job identifying that because computer moves are way too accurate. However, like 3 in 5 games at chess.com people keep leaving and returning, or run the clock. However idk how this would be cheating because i'm almost always already winning, it's just a nuisance.  I prefer lichess when it comes down to it, I've run into less ""runners"" or clock abandon-ers and again it's just so pretty."
chess,3dwg6a,amphibian87,3,Mon Jul 20 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"Just a quick note, lichess is frequently, for a big part of each day, over 4000 online players.  Must be a part of the day you don't join, I guess."

chess,3dwg6a,amphibian87,4,Mon Jul 20 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's less than chess.com, but I don't notice much difference in wait time when I ask for a game."
chess,3dwg6a,DunnoItAll,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the wait is not a big deal. One other problem I have though is higher rated players abandon the game a lot instead of filtering by rating, so after waiting a while for a game probably one in 3 (usually only 100-200 points higher than me) just leaves me to return to the lobby. however I've def never seen 4000 people on at once, and I play from like 12 noon til sometimes 3am east coast USA."
chess,3dwg6a,amphibian87,7,Mon Jul 20 04:52:44 2015 UTC,"Lichess is better if you don't want to pay anything. I, however, treated myself to a chess.com membership  and have been extremely satisfied. The video and written lessons are incredibly helpful and well organized. The tournaments are fun,plentiful, and easy to join. The computer analysis for games is fantastic, you just submit your game and get a message when it's finished being analyzed (doing your own analysis is important but sometimes not always worth the time investment). I like having a profile that includes the friends I've made while playing chess. I like watching blitz games of higher rated opponents. I like that I can always find an opponent of my skill level for any time controls.  And most importantly,  I love how nearly all of these features are also available on their mobile app. Considering that chess is such an inexpensive hobby, a premium membership can easily be justified."
chess,3dwg6a,ojchahine6,2,Mon Jul 20 09:55:32 2015 UTC,"One edge that I believe lichess has over chess.com is the fact that the former seems to actively seek out and punish cheaters. I've often had suspicions about players, only to later see their profile saying ""This player uses computer assistance."" I can't say the same about chess.com. I'd argue this is even better than an outright banning, too, as the person could potentially go weeks or months wondering why they can only find unrated games. In fact, I've seen quite a few publicly humiliate themselves by complaining about this on their forums.  On the other hand, I really enjoy the community at chess.com, and I think that's one of its strongest points. Its groups and team chess(which can be enjoyed by free members and paid members alike) are particularly fun.   Really though, why limit yourself? I'm currently a member of 5 separate chess sites, and I enjoy them all for different reasons.  edit: typo"

Still I can win clearly won games and draw some. But as I marked before, I usually get bad to the endgame but good to the middlegame (so clearly my problem is on the middlegame? Or maybe not, no idea)  Yes, the ""halfway through"" thing was a joke, I thought that was clear. And no, i'm not saying that like a milestone in the contrary.

chess,3dvcg7,BabyPoker,3,Mon Jul 20 06:18:22 2015 UTC,"Don't concentrate too much on openings. Knowing the general lines on the most popular openings is more than enough. Try to analyze your games without an engine. If you find your mistakes on your own, you'll have an easier time avoiding them in your future games. Play as much as possible, don't play too fast and double check every move."
chess,3dvcg7,BabyPoker,3,Sun Jul 19 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"So looking at the first game, your opponent decided right away that he doesn't care about his pawns or pawn structure at all and decides to throw everything at you to gain a bunch of useless tempi.   a3 is a waste of time, and b4 accomplishes nothing other than leaving the knight on c3 undefended. 8. f4 is a good move to try and get back control of e5 which white foolishly gave up earlier.  Then you put your DSB on d6... why? It's not a terrible square, but I think you would do better to put it on f6 where you can have constant pressure on the weak c3 pawn which is pinned to the rook and preventing the knight on b1 from developing. Furthermore the bishop would be a very strong defender for your king in that spot, especially if you can get your knight to g6.   Even tucking it back to b8 looks slightly better to me, having both bishops on adjacent diagonals is typically very strong, and your opponents king is nearly guaranteed to end up castled kingside.   On d6 it is slightly vulnerable to attack from enemy knights and you want to keep your bishops since the position is very open already. Also your queen may want to make use of this beautiful central square soon.  10... e5 is not a good move yet for the simple reason that you haven't developed your kingside knight and your king is not castled.  You have already won the opening with a superior position and a pawn advantage. You do not want to rush to open lines unless you have a significant development advantage. Your opponent actually is far more developed here since he thrusted all his pawns forward.  You can punish him heavily for this in the middlegame, but you need to complete your development first. Also his king will have very little safety on g1 or h1... your king will have a fortress if you so decide... so do it!  13... Nxf3? Why would you give white a free pass to develop the queen and pile up on your f7 square??? Your knight is beautiful on e5, don't trade your most active piece for nothing! 13. Nf6 seems best.  14... o-o-o !?  Why on earth would you choose a super sharp game with queenside castling when you could have a nice safe king hiding behind your pawns on g8?  By castling queenside you just made your opponents' earlier pawn thrusts correct... because now they are bearing down on your king! You also hang your poor f7 pawn (and the vulnerable d5 pawn).  At this point I like white's position better.  Once again Nf6 looks fine.  15... bxh2?? This simply looks like a blunder to me. I'm assuming you miscalculated something. Once again.... why is the f6 knight still sleeping???  Not sure what the idea with the queen checks are... Other than giving a free tempo to the white bishop... patzer see check patzer play check?  19... b6?! That's just never going to work. Even if you did manage to win the bishop, the time you lost hunting it down would surely allow your opponent to build up a massive attack.  22... Qh6 As they say, ""You are now in a world of shit."" and the game is clear lost. Your only hope is for your opponent to make a terrible mistake. The computer liked Qe6 with the idea to threaten a perpetual check and escape with a draw. I kind of like Nh6 as a last resort hoping to play Rhg8 and d4 to throw everything you have at the white king.  Well done taking advantage of your opponent's material grubbiness and escaping with a draw. Hope I could be of some help. Challenge me (chickenbrad) on lichess or chess.com sometime if you'd like.  EDIT: One last thing, if you're curious where your game fell apart, I would say it was at move 13 when you traded knights. Up until then, your position was very decent and here you gave him the fuel he needed to reclaim the advantage. e5 and o-o-o were also contributors, but 13... Nxf3 just seems to be when the momentum shifted (o-o-o being the worst decision IMO, even though the engine thought it was OK)"

chess,3dvcg7,ChickenBrad,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"I'll annotate them, give me a minute; sorry about that! I forgot.  I only played against those lines once but still it worries me.   Cool, but if you're struggling at 1300 your openings are probably bad. I'm not going to say they're your biggest weakness, but if they were good you wouldn't be a 1300.   I always feel as if I lose* halfway through the game, but i'll add more games and annotate them   Why? Chess isn't necessarily an easy game. You have to work to get better.   I know I have to work, but I'm already working hard, i'm doing lots of tactical excersices and use the chess mentor on chess.com   Here are your games in the format listed in the sidebar with the PGN viewer   thank you very much   Not knowing what you do for prep gives me very little ability to help you here.   Well, I watch youtube videos from Chessnetwork, KingsCrusher, Mato, and Kevin from the chesswebsite and even some from ichess.net and onlincehcesslessons.net and when a n opening isn't there then I try to look for books that talk about that opening and if they're unnattainable then I prepare with Stockfish and Komodo recommendations and play against engines to see how well I go.   USCF ratings are distributed were distributed like this as of a year ago, I don't believe that they've changed dramatically since. With that said, I have no idea what you're trying to imply with ""I'm half way through"".   I'm halway through, because I'm 1400 (and 1400 is half 2800, its a little joke).  My long objective is to be an international master and i'm still 17 so I might get there but now I'd like to know if i'm missing something  I'll annotate the games and comment them here  Thank you very much for your help!"
chess,3dvcg7,Zirie,4,Sun Jul 19 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"I always feel as if I lose* halfway through the game, but i'll add more games and annotate them   If your games are 30 moves long, decisive things are likely happening in the opening. Either you or your opponent is reaching an unplayable middlegame.   1400 is half 2800, its a little joke   That makes more sense, just wanted to make sure you weren't suffering from a major delusion :)  You've annotated the games, so I supposed it's only fair I provide you some feedback. Game 1:   The French Advance is not bad for white, although I'm not up on French theory. I haven't played it for either side, but last I checked the Winawer and Tarrasch were white's best tries for an advantage. 4. dxc5 is bad, white's center is broken apart too easily and black can gain time attacking it.  As /u/chickenbrad points out, 5. Qg4 would have been fairly annoying to deal with. This is a thematic move worth taking note of. In your note to move 7, ""I feel as if I was better in this position,"" I would certainly hope so. You're up a pawn for no compensation, and ahead in development. You should be crushing from here. Bb5 is normal in positions where your c6 knight is applying pressure against white's center. Here the center is already broken, so the bishop has no business on b5. Instead white is preparing to give you the bishop pair as well. What a nice guy. 9...Bd7? Missing the point. What is the bishop doing here on d7 that it wasn't doing on c8? Unpinning your knight? So it can go where? Develop your pieces to active squares. Get your king safe. After that look for play. 10...e5?? Strategic and tactical blunder. Giving your opponent a pawn, opening the center before you've castled, complicating the position unnecessarily, and makes no sense combined with Bd7. If you were playing for e5, keep the bishop on c8 so it can go to g4 or wherever in 1 move, as well as letting the queen defend d5. 14...O-O-O?? Just drops the f7 pawn, and is not particularly safe for your king (c3-c4 coming). Instead 14...Nf6 when 15. Bg5? Ne4 gives you the better minor pieces and an extra pawn.  15...Bxh2?? I thought 14...O-O-O was bad. Moves like this are how you lose games. Giving away pieces for nothing is not something you want to do. As a general rule, don't sacrifice pieces without concrete calculation. As you improve your intuition gets better, and then you can start thinking about it more.  *16...Qd6? and 17...Qb6?? What is your queen doing? Checks don't win games. Checkmate wins games. One piece does very little by itself. Meanwhile, your knight on g8 sits there waiting to be developed, and the rook on h8 is stuck behind it. As the computer points out, both 24. Kf2 and 25. Kg3 win for white. There is no perpetual. With that said, you played 22...Qh6 with an idea, and I'm glad you calculated something even if your calculation wasn't 100% correct.   Game 2:   Play the Ponziani if you want, but know that it's not a good opening. If your goal is to reach IM, my advice is to adopt a repertoire that can take you there now so that you have experience with it by the time you get there rather than having to learn something new when you hit 1800/1900/2000. 'Castle before move 10 rule'? What garbage is that? Yes, obvious you tell beginners this so they castle eventually, but don't make this an absolute rule. How about other positional considerations, like challenging the knight on e4 before black consolidates? 10...Be3?? Game losing. If you knew how to play endgames as you claim you would understand this leaves you with a very long term weakness, and drops a pawn by force. Who cares that he's attacking f2? It's defended. Tie down his pieces defending his weakness (c6), or challenge his well placed knight on e4. 14. Nd2, better late than never. I'm not convinced this is the strongest defense, but it's a try. 17. Raf1 isn't with tempo. Black isn't forced to respond.  18. Raf3, inviting back rank tactics. The four rook endgame is your best chance at a draw. Just play 18. Ra4, swap the e pawn for his a pawn, and then your passed a pawn combined with his weak c pawns give you decent chances at holding a draw.  19. Ra4 was still possible. 19. g3 just gives away your a pawn for nothing. Your opponent gives you the draw instead of tying you down to e3. Again, what a nice guy. Good on you for finding the way to draw. In general once you're down two pawns, don't be afraid of sacrificing more for piece activity. Activity is the only way to draw at that point.   Game 3:   4...Bxc3? gives up the bishop for nothing. 4...dxe4 5. Bxe4 Nf6 is a clean equalizer. Doubled pawns are only weak if you can attack them. Here, you can't, so they aren't. Not to mention that thematic Qg4 idea we saw earlier.  5...Nf6? Blunder. Runs into 6. e5 Ne4 (Nd7 is the same) 7. Qg4 and white is killing you. 8. exf6? Guess white didn't feel like calculating either. 8. Be3 Ng8 9. Qg4 and again white is killing.  Screw activity, 11...Rxg7 is tactically losing to 12. Qh8+ Ke7 13. h5 and the h pawn forces you to give up material because your pieces are so poorly placed. 16...Rg4 is objectively worse than Rg7. Your rook on g4 does nothing, and is just a target for white to play Ne5 and hit.  17. O-O-O is not a blunder, you have no pieces to take advantage of his queenside.  20...cxd4? doesn't break the center, it fixes it. White's pawns are no longer doubled, and your pawns on d5 and e6 are pretty much stuck which means your bishop gets to be terrible for the rest of the game. 22...Nf6 is a nice idea, but fails tactically to 23. Ng6+. * After move 23 you need to consider how to win. You're up a pawn, the easiest way to continue will be to try to queen one. Your center pawns are terribly placed, getting them rolling should be a top priority. From there you played competently, although your opponent really didn't put up much resistance.    Sorry if the commentary/initial post comes off as a little rough. We're here to help, we just get a lot of ""Help me, I don't know what I'm doing wrong!"" posts where people refuse to put any effort in to help us help them and that gets a bit frustrating at times.

Ra4 Qb6 25. Rb4 Qc5 26. Rb7 Rfe8 27. Rxc7 Qb6 28. Rd7 Rxe3 and black is breaking through.

chess,3dvhny,chuckguy55,3,Sun Jul 19 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"Both exactly the same in my experience, depends what size boards your club chooses to buy.

chess,3dvhny,Sheer-Luck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:59:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is the answer.  Club sets are generally unweighted or single-weighted.  Tournament sets are usually double or triple weighted.
chess,3dvhny,DunnoItAll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt since I have never played in a club or have competed in any tournaments, but my guess is that it might have something to do with size.   Tournament regulation size is played on a 20"" x 20"" board and the king has to be between 3.75"" and 4.25"" in size. Since this is quite large for travel use and very specific, I'd assume club size boards and pieces to be smaller in size or not as closely regulated.   Ex: a 15"" x 15"" board with a 3.5"" king"

Not every strong player will be abusing their customers trust, but when it's so easy to do a shit job and get away with it, I can't help but think a lot of strong players will be tempted to screw over their paying customers.

Otherwise I would go back and look at Paul Morphy's games.  He played many entertaining games that are examples of how to play the White side.    Locally (N. California) I know of two FIDE Masters that play it/allow it.  The person that allows it as Black feels it is unsound. (Though his over the board score doesn't support his theory.)  It is fun to play as White and also fun to analyze.

They love the game and can provide for themselves by teaching and playing it, I don't see anything wrong with that.   To say if they had applied themselves for this or that forgets that chess is highly specialized it only translates so far. I don't think we can say that if any of them studied theoretical physics they would have created relativity because they weren't meant for that. The wasted potential of minds are the ones trying to study physics and not getting the practice they need because they are waiting table and trying to live.  There is no guarantee any of these famous chess master would have amounted to anything extraordinary outside their pursuits in chess. They can leave a mark in a game with a rich history, and their games are studied by others to this day.   I think we get to decide what it means to waste our minds, and I don't think any of them thought they were doing so, they wanted to pursue it."

Lasker is a fascinating world champion, and was really smart and accomplished in other things. If his chess wasn't first, he could've been a great anything else. Einstein probably saw this and shook his head thinking his close friend had made a mistake. These days people live and breathe chess from birth and don't follow other avenues.

The ""...for Juniors"" book is plenty challenging for intermediates, though, so if you're just starting your tactics study, you'd probably want something else at the very beginning. I hear good things about Seirawan and Bain, though I can't speak for those personally. Pretty sure those are both ""by motif."""

chess,3dqplg,noobit,10,Sat Jul 18 15:11:00 2015 UTC,I think Hennns answer is wrong. For example if the b file pawn takes the a file pawn now you have two a file pawns and a b file pawn that can promote. This is a 3/1 ratio. I think you could end up with 28 non pawn pieces.
chess,3dqplg,strawnks,4,Sat Jul 18 15:54:26 2015 UTC,Yeah - I kept noticing this kind of pattern made it less straightforward. My solution approach to the first question used it quite a bit.  I think 28 is correct!

EDIT2: Another thought, technically all 16 pawns could promote with at the cost of only one minor piece.  After the first pawn queens, it could sacrifice itself to allow pair of pawns to become passed.  Do this a few times and all pawns will have promoted.  So all 16 pawns would promote, but I think only 9 would ultimately survive."

chess,3dqplg,Sirepicwin,5,Sat Jul 18 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"To promote 2 pawns takes one piece. So we start with 16, and then add 16/2 so we'd end up with 24 pieces. So assuming I got it right you can have 24 non-pawn pieces on the board at the same time.  For the first question, yes it's indeed 16.  Edit: wrong wrong wrong... Ignore this :)"
chess,3dqplg,LessCodeMoreLife,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"For a), the maximum number of promoted pieces is indeed 16. I tested it, and you only need to give up one minor piece to promote two pawns, one from each side (you don't have to give up any pawns at all). All pawns promote, requiring only a sacrifice of 8 minor pieces to the chess puzzle gods.  Consider the following:  1. a4 b5 2. a5 Bb7 3.a6 Nc6 4.axb7 a5 5.Ra3 a4 6.Rh3 a3 7.b8=Q a2 8.Nc3 a1=Q  Both pawns on the a file promote in exchange for only black's light squared bishop. Extrapolate for all pawns and voila, 16 extra queens or whatever other piece you wanna promote to.  I don't know if you can use the same logic to answer b) though. After all, maybe its possible to sacrifice less to promote more, I don't know. ( I doubt it. I think the answer to b) follows the same reasoning. giving up 8 minor pieces to create 16 major pieces would mean 6+16=22 major pieces)  Edit: I define major pieces as either a queen or a rook. Maximum non-pawn pieces would be 28 as in noobit's example."

They might have helped you in some places, but if I understood it right, they also made you take too much time on simpler decisions. To me, it just looks like you have a whole lot of random thoughts in your games, and while some of them are pretty straightforward, others are just kind of missing the point.   You seem to be in the transition state between not hanging as many pieces as before, but still having trouble to devise tactical maneuvers."

chess,3drww1,l0ngstory,4,Sat Jul 18 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"Against a computer it is irrelevant, more or less.  Against a higher skilled opponent, it is the exact opposite of what you should do.  The opponent wouldn't be offering you a trade unless it was beneficial to him.  You'll find that trying to trade down like that always leads to him having a wining endgame.  Against a stronger opponent, you should aim to keep pieces on the board and complicate the position.  There is a higher chance that either of you will blunder, and if it is your opponent who does, that is a win you wouldn't have gotten otherwise."
chess,3drww1,RarelySpider-Man,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm assuming he blunders by offering a trade thinking you won't go for it (because maybe you end up losing a pawn and your queen to take out his queen, etc) or maybe he just screws up.  So assuming he did not intend to trade, you should still let him have his queen? I assume he will eventual relieve me of mine and it's better to take out his while I have the chance."
chess,3drww1,-JRMagnus,6,Sat Jul 18 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"""offering a trade thinking you won't go for it"" This is called ""Hope chess"" and is not something you'll see from a skilled player."
chess,3drww1,Yodasoja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"If you're really really good at end game, sure! If it is with a time limit, it may not be as advantageous to trade because an AI creates trees for all possible moves. If you give it less pieces (and therefore less moves) it will be able to create deeper trees in the same amount of time. This allows it to see forced mates faster (or at least branches where you don't get advantage). For timed cases, just focus on not blundering as much. Don't be afraid to trade if it is semi-forced, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make trades just because they're better."

All else being equal, you'd probably have a better chance tricking them in a complex middlegame. A difference in playing level between you and a stronger opponent is only going to grow when the task becomes more technical.   Against a computer I'm sure it doesn't really matter, but I'd still rather play against an engine than a tablebase, I guess."
chess,3drww1,tha_real_stabulous,0,Sat Jul 18 22:56:33 2015 UTC,Actually computers become better when there are less pieces on the board because the number of possible moves drops with every piece.   In general you should always try to trade 'bad' pieces (like a bishop that has little room due to the enemies pawn chains) for the enemies 'good' pieces (like a knight on a safe central square).
chess,3dr4cj,fovkeke,3,Sat Jul 18 17:28:29 2015 UTC,"No, most players sub 1500 won't be very proficient in openings too. Know enough that you are not clueless ofc. Have something you can play against 1. e4 and 1. d4. And you should be good.  You have forever with time. You'll not lose on time, take all the time you feel like to make a move. Besides there's +30 sec every move, so if you do run low on time you'll still have enough time to play. Also keep in mind you get extra time after move 40. (Note you'll have to play your move #40 not get to move 40). Also, move and hit the clock with the same hand. I'd, but the game will proably be very one sided. If you want I could point out a few things though etc. Know the rules- is it fide or something else? Any special exceptions int this tourney? Do you know how to notate the game? After the game, regardless of the result, ask your opponent if he want to analyze/go over it- most will and it's a great way to learn."

To adress your answers:   Ok, I know that what I am asking for is quite stupid, but is there a defence that I can try to learn that hasn't 1million sidesteps? (like the Colle system for 1.d4 as white) Ofc, i know that the defence should suit my playstyle, but i wouldn't be able to describe it, so i am asking for a stable defence. Increment is just added after move 40. So i can't swindle myself to extra time. I'd like to if you don't mind playing against weaker opponents.

chess,3dr4cj,Hennns,3,Sat Jul 18 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"kings Indian you can play more or less the same moves regardless of what white play. You can also simply play d5 and go from there. Kings Indian have tons of variations etc. d5 is a simpler style and you can get away with natural moves. Avoid playing passive openings.  Wow. I've never seen that before. Anyway the forever with time is still true, a rule of thumb is to always have more than 5 min on the clock, but most likely you'll not have an issue with time.  Sure. Just PM me and we can find a time. Okey, two important fire tules: if your phone (or other devices that can be used for communication) make a sound/lights up or whatever you lose the game. Period. Have the phone turned of, and don't turn it on until the game is over. According to fire rules, if you're not sitting at the board once the game start- you lose. Almost every tourney have an exception to this, but you need to know how much you can be late: 3min, 15 min, 1h, 90 min or something else.. Of course if you aren't late this isn't an issue, but life happens."

On the official page it says: 40 moves/90 Min. the rest 30 Min. +30 sec/move --> this reads for me like: 90min for the first 40moves with no increment and after move 40 I get 30min +30sec  increment will do phone has to be shut off, i just checked it some days ago, and i won't be late to the event, as i want to have a look around to get a feel for everything.   something additional: i only once played with chess clocks and it was one of the old ones where you see the flag falling. my question: do the explain the buttons on the clock?"

Know that there's usually a good reason the move order is a certain way, however it's unlikely your opponents will be able to punish you. With d5, I was thinking something completely different- that is not KID. After d4 d5 you can play the moves that you think are correct and they'll be.    That typically means you'll get 30 sec every move, also those before move 40. I am 99% sure that's the case here too- though that's a question you should ask the TD Just to be sure.    There's many different clocks, but all you need to know is how to click your side and start/stop it. you'll get it (if not ask someone at the site, it's not hard)"

Being a rook and two knights up, you don't want to start giving him pawns ;-)  But for ""two weeks old"" you are doing quite well! Your concept of attacking is still a bit off like someone mentioned. Your move d4 is more gaining space and using your better development than really atatcking."
chess,3douow,AnonymousPi,3,Sun Jul 19 16:10:16 2015 UTC,"2.e4 not the best. You're ceding a lot of pawn control on d3/d4. Black might eventually capitalize with Nc6 to Nd4. Usually the English for white goes 2. Nc3 (securing the d5 square) or 2. g3 (preparing to fianchetto the light squared bishop on g2 and also securing the d5 square).  3...a6. Your opponent might have been thinking of 4...b5 to attack your c-pawn. That doesn't work, as you have three defenders on b5.   4...Bd6. Bad because it blocks in black's d-pawn from advancing. Better was Nc6 or Be7, simple development.   8.d4. I like this move (maybe there are better moves here, but fundamentally this is a good idea)  8...Bb7. This is a little slow. Black is a bit cramped on space, and after the exchanges Nxd4, exd4, etc. black can now play Bb7 with much greater effect. Other good moves are Re8, or maybe rectifying his earlier mistake and playing Be7.   Okay, a ton of blunders from black and now you're coming out with a definite winning position.   14.Nd5. Pretty good move, centralizing your knight and threatening the queen and Nxc7. Just a tip though, in the future, when up so much in material, it's good to trade off pieces. Here, maybe considering Nxe5. Nothing big here, I mean, your move was just as good.    14...Qc5. And it doesn't matter because he blunders that knight anyways.   Okay, nothing really of note the rest of the game. Your question was, quickest way to mate.   Honestly, I don't see an immediate mate, but considering your opponent is extremely week, I would have piled my rooks and queens on the e-file and hope for a back rank mate. For example, Re1, then Re3, Qd2, Rae1."
chess,3douow,BabyPoker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:52:39 2015 UTC,I think 2. g3 is better than 2. Nc3 because in some lines the knight wants to stay flexible and you don't want to commit it yet to c3.

You should try your best to consider all checks, captures, threats from both sides before making a move and sanity check just before dropping the piece."
