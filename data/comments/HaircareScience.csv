When doing your roots, apply the bleach to that area first then the rest of your hair. Those hairs are still in the catagen phase and are harder to break down with bleach.   Edit: I wouldnt worry about the rest of your hair becoming that way. Just add a longer processing time to the front, and see how that works. I'd actually be really interested in knowing if it changes once you leave the bleach on for longer."

HaircareScience,3e0gr4,talonofdrangor,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"Wavy / curly hair isn't bad at all, it could just be your hair's natural state. My hair texture changed pretty drastically about 10 years ago (used to be very straight and silky, but is now very wavy, rather dehydrated, and all around more problematic). Has your hair always been wavy, or was it once very straight? Also, do you have any goal or idea of what you want your hair to look like? And if your hair is pretty curly, you can look around /r/curlyhair as well. I see quite a few guys posting over there too, so it definitely isn't just for women or people with long hair."
HaircareScience,3dyigv,rab0t,8,Mon Jul 20 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're overloading on protein. Your hair might be sensitive to it. Protein functions in two ways in hair products, to make it soft and strong. Sometimes when you are adding more protein than your hair needs, it builds up and becomes brittle, as protein adds rigidity to the hair structure. Also note that coconut oil doesn't itself contain protein, but penetrates the hair and prevents the loss of protein.   Try other penetrating oils, like sunflower seed, olive, etc. or non-penetrating, depending on what you're aiming for and what your hair likes. Here is a link to a page about oil properties.   If you've found that you are protein sensitive, try to avoid products with ingredients such as ""Hydrolyzed _____""  Also, if Herbal Essences worked so well, why stray from that routine? Unless it had protein and that was the reason why you switched? I don't understand that part."
HaircareScience,3dyigv,two-moons,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"You absolute gem, thank you! That list of oils was exactly what I needed. I've had the best luck by far with jojoba oil, so I'll keep up with that. Sounds like the coconut oil is just exacerbating the ""too much protein"" problem even if it's not adding to it. I'm going to do a little more digging to figure out why it's so drying to my skin, as well.   Â   As for dropping Herbal Essences, I'm just interested in taking better care of my hair. The products work very well for me, but most of them do contain sulfates and strip out oils (maybe less than other brands, though?). I wanted to try the less-poo route for a while to see where it got me (especially if it results in fewer flyaways and less frizziness), so we'll see how it goes, I guess."
HaircareScience,3dyigv,two-moons,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. If the low-poo doesn't work out for you, you can always dilute your shampoo! I cut mine by half with water so it's less strong and easier to spread/foam."
HaircareScience,3dyigv,allonsyyy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, that's brilliant! Thanks for the advice. I'm guessing the same can be done with conditioner too, though I may just stick with pure jojoba oil for that step (though I might try adding something to make it easier to apply evenly)."
HaircareScience,3dyigv,looney4lupin,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Just be careful diluting, you dilute the preservatives and that might let mold or other nasties take hold in the bottle. Dilute as you use to be safe, or store your shampoo in the fridge? That would be a bit silly... And a bit chilly..."
HaircareScience,3dyigv,looney4lupin,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:49 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, good point! Thanks again for the pointers, I really appreciate it.

HaircareScience,3dutav,CassandraXsandOs,16,Sun Jul 19 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   For growing out hair it is very important that you get regular trims. I had hair as short as yours (maybe even shorter) and I grew it out a bit longer than what you're aiming for. It took about 3 years. I recommend getting a trim every 2 months or so to trim off the split ends and so on.   I also recommend that you learn how to style your hair without heat damaging tools. There are lots of options for no-heat curls that are very easy and gentle on hair. Personally, I also let my hair air dry.   I think highlights would look very good on you. Maybe even an ombre.  As for products, sulphate free shampoos are recommended.   Edit: A couple more points  1.) Never use a brush on wet hair. Purchase a de-tangling comb.   2.) Try to limit shampooing your hair every day. I also have oily hair like you, and I have limited myself to shampooing my hair every second or third day. To keep the oil from ruining my hair, I use dry shampoo between shampoos."

Buying the ""matching"" dry shampoo of the same brand I don't think is necessary. I use a matching set of shampoo and conditioner, but the dry shampoo I use is a different brand entirely.   You may want to try out CO washing (conditioner only). Check out /r/nopoo or this thread from HaircareScience https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m0g7c/conditioner_only_method_cowashing/.  This is a good video to watch that talks about the best way to grow out your hair in regards to washing, conditioning, styling and so on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rwMIm0VlpA . It discusses what ingredients to avoid in shampoo and conditioner. This way you can learn what ingredients to avoid and choose a shampoo-conditioner (or just conditioner if you choose to go the CO washing route) that best suits your price range and the end result you're looking for (hydrating/volumizing/colour protecting, etc). She also recommends brands of shampoo and conditioner that she uses. I really recommend that you watch it.

HaircareScience,3dutav,captainzoobydooby,13,Mon Jul 20 07:54:52 2015 UTC,"Alright beautiful!  Always trim your hair. This keeps the whole length of your hair healthy. I know it feels odd to keep cutting it if you want it long. But trust me. 10 inches of split ends won't look cute, and the split will travel up the shaft of the hair over time.  Look at hair, skin, and nails vitamins, and generally eat healthy. There's no magic pinterest serum to make hair grow faster. But giving your body what it needs is close.   I manage a kitchen, and we wear hats. So my greasy hat hair game is strong. So strong. I fell in love with cowashing,as it gets all the gunk out of my hair and keeps it managable. I can also go longer without washing my hair because my scalp isn't constantly trying to replace what shampoo strips it of. I have long hair with a mind of its own. They call me Merida (girl from brave) at work. Your local target will likely sell mane and tail, herbal essences cleansing conditioner, or renpure cleansing conditioner. They'll also take stuff back if you try one and don't love it. Cowashing isn't for everyone, but you might love it.  Always be nice to your hair. Thermal protection is a must if you heat style, for sure. Hair is just dead protein, so once you damage it,it's damaged. Don't believe the jargon in shampoo commercials.  As far as your style goal, do whatever makes you feel good!! I will warn you once you start coloring your hair,you're in it for the long haul in coloring your hair. I just chopped several inches of several different shades off. Breaking the cycle is rough.  Have you thought about getting extensions put in?one of the guys I work with has hair about as long as yours, and he sometimes has extentions in and it looks awesome. Depending on where you're at you might have access to a salon that can put them in for you and have them stay put for a while. Sometimes it's fun to put in some pieces of fake hair in cool colors, so you get all the glory of fun without the upkeep, lol.   Sorry I wrote you a book."

HaircareScience,3dutav,andampersand,8,Tue Jul 21 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"I highly suggest upping your daily omega-3 intake, by either consuming fish regularly or taking daily supplements. I've been taking them for about two years now and the hair that has grown in that time is noticeably softer, shinier, and healthier. It is known that omega-3 also helps keep your skin and nails looking healthy.  There's not much that you can do to make your hair actually grow faster. I do not have any studies to back this up, but my friends and I have noticed that our hair has grown a lot faster when travelling to humid places. We live in an extremely dry climate, and it does seem that humidity helps hair growth. You could get a humidifier, but most of your efforts should be focused on growing hair that is healthy. I would recommend a sulfate-free shampoo used as little as possible, as shampoo can really dry out your hair; I shampoo mine every 3-4 days, but I have extremely dry hair. Try to avoid blow drying and heat styling as much as possible, and get regular trims to avoid split ends. That's all the advice I can think of! :) Good luck in your hair journey!  Edit: spelling"
HaircareScience,3dutav,kittensandnails,6,Sun Jul 19 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"That style's going to be so insanely cute on you.

Use as little oil as possible and soak with conditioner before rinsing out. Make sure the conditioner doesn't has any silicones to prevent buildup (you look like you have relatively thick hair already and I see no breakage that needs to be 'glued' with silicone).

HaircareScience,3dutav,smashes2ashes,4,Sun Jul 19 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are recommending trimming your hair often, but I figured I'd throw in my 2 cents on that- if you don't heat style your hair very often (and you shouldn't if you're trying to grow it out) you might not even have to do this. I don't get trims when I grow my hair out except for the sake of style. I just don't really get split ends. So YMMV."
HaircareScience,3du0aq,getyashinebox,10,Sun Jul 19 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"Well dandruff is dead skin cells from the scalp which can be caused by dryness, so I'm not entirely sure why it is that you don't think it's dandruff? Is there anything else going on with it? Dandruff can be very tiny.  Everyone has dandruff, just most people's isn't visible as there isn't much of it and you have to be fairly close to see it - don't beat yourself up over something that may only be tunnel vision.  I'd suggest dandruff shampoo and in-shower combing, and depending on your hair type, looking into a brush with a lot of fibres quite closely packed. You could try speaking to a dermatologist or your doctor to see if there's an underlying reason for whatever you're seeing."

HaircareScience,3du0aq,ohsnowy,8,Mon Jul 20 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"Dandruff isn't just dry skin on the scalp sometimes. It can be caused by several things: a yeast-like fungus, seborrhoeic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, general irritation from shampooing too often, etc. The large yellow scales you speak of are usually caused by seborrhoeic dermatitis, which is only one possible cause for dandruff.  Common treatments for dandruff include ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral is available OTC), salicylic acid shampoos (Neutrogena T-Sal), and coal tar (Neutrogena T-gel). Antifungals besides ketoconazole that are less effective include zinc pyrithione (Head and Shoulders) and selenium disulfide (Selsun Blue). Ketoconazole is more effective because it has a broader spectrum; put simply, it controls more fungi and yeasts that the other options.  From a personal perspective, I began shampooing with Nizoral many years ago, and now my dandruff is under control. I only need to shampoo with the Nizoral every other shampoo (twice a month for me)."

I know this doesn't sound like very helpful advice, but you could try growing healthier hair from now on and slowly cut off the damaged parts.  Also, if you're going no-poo I would be careful about the heat protectant since a lot of them use -cones, although I'm not sure which brand you're using. Here is a list of heat protectants that do not contain -cones. If you use fewer styling products, you could probably start clarifying less often Nowadays, I'm usually able to get away with clarifying about once a month since I only really use a cone-free leave-in conditioner as a styling product."

You are buying bleach and dyes but you don't have the same skills as a hairdresser. To avoid further damage I'd suggest either sticking with your box dye or seeing a hairdresser for a consultation and getting them to give you the colour you want."

Not an expert, but I've been using box dye for over 10 years to fix my genetic mis-coloring. I'm 28 and have naturally fine hair, but it's much thicker than before dye. It's full of split ends, but I'm not kind to it (brush abusively, yank out hairties, never oil or deep condition, etc). It's waist-long. I prefer Feria dye; that has the best colors and seems (unscientifically) to leave my hair in better condition than other brands."

They work wonderfully for the little touch ups you need to do and I also use them for trimming my eyebrows (yay caterpillars!). Otherwise if you have a friend who's a beauty student or has their license you can ask if they'd be willing to stop at their local wholesale outlet and pick you up a pair if you front the cash. Those arent the nice $700 ones, they're a little better than what Sallys sells at the same price of what's at Sallys.   I've had my Sallys pair for about 3 years and am probably going to retire them shortly. So the life span isn't bad. I haven't checked out their online store but they might even sell them there.   EDIT! Keep in mind if you do buy shears, don't ever use them on anything but your hair. Got an itchy tag or even a loose thread in your shirt,get the craft scissors. The edge on hair shears is super fine and anything ""harder"" than hair will put a tiny nick in the blades."

Sallys gets a rough wrap, but the have the EXACT same stuff as wholesale stores (minus the colour lines) for maybe only 5-20 dollars more depending on the item (i.e. Combs vs hairdryers/curlers/straighteners)"
HaircareScience,3df9o5,diinomunster,5,Thu Jul 16 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"There are several different things that hairdressers need to consider for shears. We do tons of cutting, so Japanese forged steel is the best because it stays sharp longer and cuts precisely. These can cost hundreds of dollars.  You can get decent quality shears on Amazon for much cheaper or you can run to Sally's and get a cheap pair there. You are not doing the same amount of cutting a hairdresser does and aren't trying to create a precise bob.   The difference between craft scissors and shears is that craft scissors tend to ""saw"" hair a bit. They will work for the occasional split end, but if you are planning on doing this often I would definitely get a cheap pair of shears. They are designed to cut hair, not paper or cloth. Just don't go overboard with the trimming because I've seen bad things happen when people try to cut their own hair. Get the bad split ends with the shears and call it a day."
HaircareScience,3df9o5,diinomunster,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely... It's not my livelihood, so it's not in my budget to fork over hundreds of dollars for forged Japanese steel! haha.  And I definitely don't plan to actually full-fledged trim the hair myself. My top and middle sections are well maintained by the seasonal trim, but I have a lot of breakage underneath from using the wrong kind of hair-tie. (I've been trying to be better about that.) Getting the split ends off those broken underneath hairs that are too short to get trimmed in the normal cut is the goal!"
HaircareScience,3df9o5,diinomunster,3,Thu Jul 16 15:32:47 2015 UTC,Scissors for threads are likely good - they're very sharp and built for cutting thin things.
HaircareScience,3df9o5,diinomunster,6,Wed Jul 15 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"Thread is still much firmer than a hair shaft, meaning the edge of those scissors is still wider (not as sharp) as shears. We went over this like day one when I was at Aveda. I have the handout somewhere, I'll see if I can find it. Hair is actually kind of soft and squishy, shears glide through the hair vs chop or cut it leaving it with an undamaged cut. Thread scissors and the like can leave uneven cuts as it essentially guillotines the hair shaft and inevitably ""rips"" it. You can't see or feel the difference right away but it will promote splits to happen faster."
HaircareScience,3dejqa,sheldor19,2,Wed Jul 15 17:32:34 2015 UTC,Go to Sally's and get a demi permanent it's going to give you color with out as much damage. You're hair will feel better and you'll be able to pick a more precise shade. You'll be using to strong of a developer if you use a box. Demi and 10 volume are all you need.
HaircareScience,3dejqa,Laney67,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:39:58 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure what developer is. Is it the same as bleach? Do I need it if my hair is lighter than the dye I want? And my only option is buying it at Shopper's Drug Mart..

HaircareScience,3d5j74,emilance,3,Mon Jul 13 23:50:25 2015 UTC,I have the dark and the light.  I've never noticed the dark on my pillow but I have crappy sheets so it wouldn't bother me.  I think the towel would work and you could get some cheap men's cotton T-shirts to put over your pillow (works great for fabric damaging skin products). The dark has been bothering me lately because it makes my fingernails look dirty and gross if I touch my hair so I decided to try the white kind. I have dark hair and if I use it over night I don't have a white cast.  It seems to work a little better also.  I save the dark stuff for quick touch ups before leaving the house.

HaircareScience,3d5j74,emilance,3,Tue Jul 14 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"My hair is black and I do not use the brown kind, because of the color transfer and because of how warm-toned it is which just doesn't match my hair. I use the vanilla ""Wild"" scent, which comes out white. I just do a few thin sprays, brushing it out in between, so it builds up gradually and isn't too white. And sometimes I'll use a boar-bristle style brush after a thick overnight spray to brush it out, which makes the white cast go away too."

I like to apply it before bed to really let it absorb oil, then I can just wake up and go. It can also be used in clean hair as a volumizer. I just really cannot recommend this product enough, it's changed my hair routine completely for the better!"
HaircareScience,3d5j74,lauruhhpalooza,2,Tue Jul 14 03:07:57 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. I was actually pretty leery about No Drought at first, but I bought the little bottle and haven't regretted a moment. I have dark hair, and brushing the product through really does remove all traces. Plus, it doesn't make my baby hair feel gross, and it smells divine!"
HaircareScience,3d5j74,beccathisweek,3,Tue Jul 14 11:29:03 2015 UTC,"Same. I've learned to use dry shampoo before I actually need it, and this helps with the itchy/gross feeling. So like, for second day hair, I will use it before I go to bed the night before. I use Not Your Mother's and love it. Batiste was hit or miss for me. (long, fine hair here)"

I wash and style my hair AM day one, PM day one I spray Batiste dry shampoo on my roots only and brush through. Day 2 AM I wake up with perfect full hair, so I just brush and go! Day 3 AM I typically have pretty good looking hair that just needs a brushing, but sometimes I needs another small mist of dry shampoo in spots.  Batiste doesn't make my hair feel dirty, just fuller with a bit of texture. Other brands did feel dirty, even when using it before going to bed."

HaircareScience,3d7ah0,Psychosholtis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:02:05 2015 UTC,"I will put it this way there is no way possible way to make a ""chemical free"" shampoo. The reason why is you will always need some sort of persevered. There are mild perseveres that are not harsh and very low toxicity.   If you want a truly chemical free shampoo you would have to make it yourself and you would have to refrigerate it. It would only last probably 2... Maybe 3 weeks before it started producing mold and bacteria.   Well...  Only ""chemical free"" option is actually a shampoo bar. That's the only option I can think of."
HaircareScience,3d7ah0,Mtfilmguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not an expert by any means and my opinion is based entirely on some quick internet research on individual ingredients in their ingredients lists.  I have never tried Juice Organics, but their shampoos seem to be just alright. A lot of them contain apple juice, white grape juice, pomegranate juice, and aloe juice high up on the ingredients list. Honestly, I haven't found many reliable sources concerning apple juice, white grape juice, pomegranate juice and hair, so I'm not sure how good those will be for your hair. Aloe is usually used as a humectant, but can also be used to remove mineral buildup. Aloe is also high in protein. So I think the main concern is over-proteination (is that a word?) from the aloe. A lot of the other main ingredients in the shampoos look to mostly be mild surfactants. I don't see any sulfates if you're concerned about that. The other concern I have is that they seem to randomly put a lot of organic extracts and essential oils. I don't really know why they have petitgrain oil (perhaps for the aroma?), rice syrup extract, or sugar cane extract in a shampoo.  Along similar lines, their conditioners seem to be ok-- nothing too harmful, but once again, lots of grape juice, pomegranate, and aloe; lots of essential oils and extracts. The good thing is that the conditioners also have some nice moisturizing ingredients (such as sunflower seed oil, jojoba oil, olive oil) around the beginning and middle of the ingredients list. Also, the conditioners contain fatty alcohols towards the middle / end of the list. Fatty alcohols are moisturizing but are known to cause some buildup issues on certain people, so if you're sensitize to fatty alcohols, be warned!  So in general, I think the shampoos and conditioners seem alright, but I'm not sure if it's really worth $10. Also for future reference, some ""chemicals"" can be good! For example, the Juice Organics shampoos contain some mild surfactants which wash your hair more gently than SLS's. So they're not totally ""free of chemicals,"" but they don't seem to contain any outstandingly unhealthy chemicals."

You might want to head over to /r/curlyhair and learn how to maximize the curl in your hair. They recommend a different way of approaching your hair that I find is generally less intensive that blow drying and styling used to be for me. I used to blow dry my hair straight every day but when left to airdry it became all stringy and frizzy/wavy. When I started co-washing, squish to condish, plopping, and pineappling I noticed a huge difference."

HaircareScience,3d55uy,TheDivergentStars,6,Mon Jul 13 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the preious person's comment about trying some curly girl methods. But if you need to blow dry, try doing it in sections. I generally divide it right at the ears all the way across and pin the top up in a clip and dry the bottom. Then take the next section down (around my temples) and dry. Then let down the top and do that. Its the easiest way to get a professional looking blow out for me. If your hair is really thick, you may need more sections. My hair is pretty fone so three sections works for me but my bestie has super thick hair and does smaller sections. Experiment and have fun. The link below will give you sort of an idea of what im talking about, but i use more sections than they do.  http://thebeautydepartment.com/2011/08/a-clean-canvas/"
HaircareScience,3d55uy,gewwwww,3,Mon Jul 13 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I already divide my hair into sections when I blow dry, and it still takes forever. :/"
HaircareScience,3d55uy,ConvertsToMetric,3,Mon Jul 13 20:09:38 2015 UTC,When I blow dry I just generally dry all over my head (not in sections) until it is about 80% dry. Then I section it and  blow dry as usual. Smaller sections obviously blow dry quicker.   One thing I would seriously look into though is products specifically designed to cut down blow drying time. I have used Moroccan oil for years and the receptionist at my hairdresser said it really cuts down blow drying time and she has really thick hair. I have also tried KMS California Freeshape Quick Blow Dry spray which really worked in speeding up drying time. There are loads of products like these out there though so I would suggest do a bit of research and testing!
HaircareScience,3d55uy,GeeEmPee,3,Tue Jul 14 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"All great advice here so I won't repeat anything already said, but what kind of haircut do you have? If your hair is long, you would greatly benefit from having a lot of layers cut in your hair. FWIW, my hair is about 4 inches below my shoulders, somewhat wavy, and it used to take me about 25-30 minutes to blow dry it smooth with a roundbrush. Then I got the best haircut I've had in awhile. She blended my overgrown bangs into these gorgeous layers and my hair now takes 15-20 minutes to blowdry. It also air dries faster so I don't have to spend as much time ""pre-drying"" before I dive in with the roundbrush."

HaircareScience,3d1mka,Fruitforthought,2,Sun Jul 12 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt your hair is damaged unless you've been relaxing it. You have the kind of hair that grows out instead of down. A few options come to mind. One would be letting it grow and fro out a bit, and then relax it, which will just tame it down a bit, or get a Japanese straight perm. However both of these options can be expensive, damaging and high maintenance.   The second thing that comes to mind, is grow it out for as long as you can stand and then dread it. Dreads can be tasteful and neat if done professionally, and you could naturally achieve long hair that has a small silhouette."
HaircareScience,3d1mka,tawnirux,2,Sun Jul 12 20:48:17 2015 UTC,I relaxed once when I was younger. My hair did get damaged and it didn't really help in making it look bouncy and healthy so I just shaved it off.   So is it impossible for me to have hair like this?
HaircareScience,3d1mka,tawnirux,4,Sun Jul 12 21:02:40 2015 UTC,You just don't have that type of hair. Perhaps a Japanese straight perm or keratin smoothing treatment would help you achieve something more manageable for you
HaircareScience,3cyfgp,crunchyhair,6,Sat Jul 11 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"So I've been a pretty careless person with my hair. I've colored it many times. I went from natural medium brown, to black, to strawberry blonde, to red, back to black, and then to this brown/blonde monstrosity. The first time my hair was bleached, it was a little angry, and then when I got my ends bleached for the second time around, it's downright hideous. It's been a month since I got this dip dye done at a salon. I realize I made some terrible decisions.  The pictures show my natural hair texture. It's slightly wavy and very frizzy. It feels dry, like straw or synthetic hair. It tangles easily too. The roots can get very greasy if left unwashed. People who cut my hair describe it as ""baby fine"", but I have a lot of hair. It's slightly past my shoulders. So my hair is an awful combination of oily, dry, and damaged. It even comes off in clumps when I shower.  I don't use heat products on my hair anymore. I used to straighten it a lot years ago, but it never seemed to have much effect on my hair. It used to be shiny and soft. I wash my hair everyday with Tresemme shampoo and a sulfate-free Tresemme conditioner that I leave in for three-five minutes at a time. I heard that coconut oil helps damaged hair, so I've been using that every week, leaving it on overnight and rinsing it out in the morning, and it honestly has not done a thing for me except made my scalp greasy.  Suggestions are very welcome! Thanks for reading  EDIT: Failed to mention that I towel dried my hair for years, but recently switched to wrapping my hair in cotton tshirts and letting it airdry. Towel drying makes my hair break now."
HaircareScience,3cyfgp,_fevertotell,2,Sat Jul 11 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're on the right track, avoiding heat will definitely help. I'm not a professional, so i can't offer any pro advice, but I do get my hair colored every month and I have very dry hair to begin with, so I know how you're feeling.  You could go to a salon and ask for a deep conditioning treatment, and maybe add some toner to the ends. I won't say you should avoid color altogether, but I do think you should avoid lightening and bleach to help your hair recover.  For products, I've had bad luck with tresemme. It makes my hair really brittle. I currently use clear brand shampoo for damaged hair, you may want to give that a go. I'd also recommend using a deep conditioner at home at least once a week; use it from your ears down, keeping it away from your scalp."

HaircareScience,3cyfgp,Mickeex,2,Sun Jul 12 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"It can be done as a standalone treatment or as part of a color treatment, I think.  I've seen it work wonders on people's damaged hair.  Afaik, it's not a conditioning treatment but it actually repairs the bonds in your hair."
HaircareScience,3cyfgp,MissyMoodle,2,Sun Jul 12 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"You can purchase the traveling olaplex kit on amazon for around  $80 which will be several applications. This will make your hair feel healthier and will restore some of the bonds in your hair,  however it won't completely fix your hair. Once hair grows out of your scalp it is considered dead because it does not receive nutrients from the body and it can not repair itself.   Processing hair makes it fray. At this point you will have to constantly be putting conditioners and oils to smooth it down and help it look healthy.  I would ditch your cheap shampoo ASAP and get a salon quality shampoo and conditioner as well as a conditioning mask.  Maybe go to a different salon and have them do a blowout with their most hydrating shampoo and conditioner and if you like it then go back and buy it from them.  Don't waste your money on a having a stylist give you a deep conditioning treatment, just buy the deep conditioner from them and put it on yourself in the shower and let it sit for 15 minutes.    I also have over processed hair. I use a heavy conditioner or mask daily then I tame my frizzy cuticle with hairdresser oils which are silicones. I've never been able to go no poo,  but allowing your natural oils to coat your hair will help too.   Good luck girl!"
HaircareScience,3cyfgp,Mickeex,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"You can buy this as a one time treatment on amazon for a reasonable price amd probably less tgen you would spend at the salon.

HaircareScience,3cyfgp,lemonbalm,5,Mon Jul 13 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"Having fried my hair with bleach before I hope I can offer some advice. Try a hair mask if you haven't, Aphogee and Ion both make a good protein restore mask. If you're willing to go shorter- do it. It helped my hair a lot just getting rid of most of the damaged hair. Stop washing it everyday, or if you do need to wash it everyday try co-washing instead. Cutting back on washing will be difficult at first, but your hair will slowly get used to not being washed everyday. And in the process won't get as greasy in between washes. PM me if you want any more info/links   Check out /r/nopoo and maybe /r/curlyhair for possible low damage routines that focus on restoring moisture and life to hair."
HaircareScience,3cyfgp,MissyMoodle,4,Sun Jul 12 00:59:05 2015 UTC,I've always wanted to try the r/nopoo method but the grease during the first week has always made me change my mind... Guess I have a reason to really stick with it now.  Thank you for your advice!
HaircareScience,3cyfgp,lemonbalm,3,Sun Jul 12 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"From my experience, nothing will ever restore the hair. It just isn't possible. Bleach pretty much violently rips open the follicles and makes the hair really porous and brittle. You're in a way better position than I was in, though, if it makes you feel any better. I bleached my entire head with a very strong formula and totally screwed my hair up. And it was really long, too. I had to wait years for it to grow out and look somewhat decent... It was seriously awful! It shouldn't take long for your hair to grow out, though. For now, if you can, I would cut as much off as possible! The only thing you can really do in the meantime is wait. Honestly, it is all that can be done. I know this from experience. My hair was super fried...but it got a bit more presentable after using some products for a while while it grew out.  These are my absolute favorite products:  Pureology Hydrate Shampoo & Conditioner (a bit expensive, but honestly helped)  Redken Extreme Strength Builder Plus  That second product seriously helped my hair not feel like straw every day! I would ditch the coconut oil if it it weighing your hair down and trade it for the Redken Strength Builder. Good luck!"
