Many reefs are built using objects that were built for other purposes, for example by sinking oil rigs (through the Rigs-to-Reefs program), scuttling ships, or by deploying rubble or construction debris. Other artificial reefs are purpose built (e.g. the reef balls) from PVC or concrete. Shipwrecks may become artificial reefs when preserved on the sea floor. Regardless of construction method, artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles, corals, and oysters attach; the accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides intricate structure and food for assemblages of fish.

The lighter oil is flung out in small droplets. These droplets burn faster and more violently due to their increased surface area and now your kitchen is on fire."
holdmybeaker,37ftbt,M8asonmiller,19,Wed May 27 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"if I remember correctly from the mythbusters episode on this, yes that's what happens. The water evaporates/boils in the oil really fast, making the oil fly everywhere which makes it burn faster and more violently. I also fixed the downvote for you."
holdmybeaker,37ftbt,n23_,7,Wed May 27 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"thanks, sorry for cussing.  I get overly upset when I check my history and see a downvote and no comment added.  If I'm wrong in my question at least explain it to me.    I've seen countless videos of people throwing water on a oil fire but I've never seen it in such slow motion that I could sort of devise what was happening.  Which sparked my question."

holdmybeaker,37ftbt,tacobells_cannon,8,Wed May 27 16:12:07 2015 UTC,So what is the best way to put out burning oil? A fire extinguisher right? But what if you don't have one? Putting a lid on the pot?
holdmybeaker,37ftbt,Rabada,3,Wed May 27 16:28:17 2015 UTC,Everyone should have a fire blanket and fire extinguisher in their kitchen. However if you don't a lid or a damp tea towel is probably the next best thing.

holdmybeaker,37ftbt,johnothetree,2,Wed May 27 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"When my sister was about 11 she decided to make churros. She heated some oil, but before she even got the chance to drop any batter in, the oil started smoking. As she was headed to our front door with the pot, the oil ignited. She made it just outside, dropped the pot, and then called our older sister for help. Our older sister grabbed our trusty old fire extinguisher (literally so old I wasn't sure it would work) and sprayed it all over the pot. All it did was cover our entry way with whatever foam is in fire extinguishers. We then realized we had a lid for the pot, threw that on, and the fire went out almost instantly.  tl;dr a fire extinguisher is just going to get everything dirty and make your mom wonder why she came home to find you sitting across the street breathing through wet rags. Use a lid."

holdmybeaker,36r3p0,frejil,4,Tue Jun 2 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! So first, what is a proper furnace? It is a container where you heat things. It contains an intake for pure oxygen gas, fuel (such as propane or acetylene gas), and optionally for other application specific materials. It contains an outtake for the co2 and water made from combustion. Inside, you put the metal/rocks/whatever you want to melt and ignite it. The furnace is sealed with lots of ceramic material to minimize heat loss.   It turns out rocks melt at lower temperatures than many important metals so it isn't too hard to make lava. The problem is lava is corrosive and will potentially hurt other objects (rusting them) due to impurities in the rocks.  I'm new to smelting so please correct any errors in this!"

holdmybeaker,367ge0,swiftraid,3,Sun May 17 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"Although aqua regia can dissolve gold that is due to the specific chemistry involved there.  I do not believe it is any more effective at attacking human flesh.  Anecdotally I have always heard that HF is one of the most dangerous acids to work with, and this is almost surely why the writers chose it for Breaking Bad.  However, a number of people have done tests which seem to indicate that HF is not substantially more reactive on flesh than either HCl or H2SO4.  What I have found even more interesting is just how little breakdown of flesh actually occurred in these tests, particularly when compared to the rat in this test.  Unfortunately, none of these tests specified the molarity of the acids nor the duration of the test so it is difficult to draw any conclusions here.  Assuming this video is not fake, it does appear that time is a more important factor in decomposition than the strength of the acid."
holdmybeaker,367ge0,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Sun May 17 12:28:32 2015 UTC,"HF is not dangerous for the same reasons as any other acid because the acidity isn't the danger. It is the flouride serving as the counter ion which will outcompete your bones for binding calcium, dissolving it into your blood and other bodily fluids. This eventually caused heart failure. There is no treatment for fluoride poisoning to my knowledge. Further, it takes a tiny amount on the skin to cause death"

holdmybeaker,367ge0,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:36:50 2015 UTC,Glad to help! It is a common misconception. The reason it dissolves bodies so well is the dissolving bones bit. Dissolving everything else can be done by water with enough time.

I use a similar solution to etch printed circuit boards (HCl + H2O2) and the reaction can indeed be quite violent even when relatively low concentrations are used.  This does seem as if it would be far more effective for body disposal, particularly if you are in a hurry.  (see my comment on HF elsewhere in this thread.)"

holdmybeaker,35x2tz,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Thu May 14 21:00:18 2015 UTC,It's just difficult and expensive to build a big parabolic mirror ; where it's cheap to glue flat mirrors on a parabolic surface.

The results will be even better if you use a true parabola, such as can be found in the older analog satellite TV dishes."

Turntable set to a constant, low speed. Pour the plaster into a dish on centered on the turntable. The fluid's surface will naturally form a parabolic shape proportional to the rotational speed. Keep it spinning at a constant rate until it is dried, possibly all the way until it cures, and you've got a decent approximation of a parabolic surface. Then coat it to smooth out the rough surface, and apply a reflective coating to the now-smooth parabolic dish.  Probably not as good as professional grade stuff, but I'd definitely be interested to see how it might compare to the ""lots of tiny flat mirrors approach"" in terms of both cost and surface area."

holdmybeaker,35x2tz,currentscurrents,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"Foucault knife-edge test:       The Foucault knife-edge test was described in 1858 by French physicist Léon Foucault to measure conic shapes of optical mirrors, with error  margins measurable in fractions of wavelengths of light (or Angstroms, millionths of an inch, or nanometers).   It is commonly used by amateur telescope makers for figuring small astronomical mirrors. Its relatively simple, inexpensive apparatus can produce measurements more cost-effectively than most other testing techniques.    It measures mirror surface dimensions by reflecting light into a knife edge at or near the center radius (R) of mirror curvature. In doing so, it only needs a tester which in its most basic 19th century form consists of a light bulb, a piece of tinfoil with a pinhole in it, and a razor blade to create the knife edge. The testing device is adjustable along the X-axis (knife cut direction) across the Y-axis (optical axis), and must have measurable adjustment to 0.001 inch (25 µm) or better along lines parallel to the optical axis.  According to Texereau it amplifies mirror surface defects by a factor of one million, making them easily accessible to study and remediation.

It uses an array of flat, movable mirrors (called heliostats) to focus the sun's rays upon a collector tower (the target). Concentrated solar thermal is seen as one viable solution for renewable, pollution-free energy.  Early designs used these focused rays to heat water, and used the resulting steam to power a turbine. Newer designs using liquid sodium have been demonstrated, and systems using molten salts (40% potassium nitrate, 60% sodium nitrate) as the working fluids are now in operation. These working fluids have high heat capacity, which can be used to store the energy before using it to boil water to drive turbines. These designs also allow power to be generated when the sun is not shining.    Image i - The decommissioned Solar Two near Barstow, CA.

This is also the cause of gravitational lensing; light rays traveling in a straight line which get near a massive body appear to be bent, not because the light is affected by the gravity (light is massless and is not attracted by gravity), but because the actual space it is traveling through is bent.  Edit: They are in a non-accelerating reference frame since if you were the feather you would not feel acceleration/gravity, and would feel weightless.

holdmybeaker,35mf26,spigotface,2,Mon May 11 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"I would like to say that the rule should be changed so that it should include elements of danger under less than ideally controlled conditions. Here is why:  The name ""/r/holdmybeaker"" implies that this sub is supposed to be a science (mainly chemistry) focused version of /r/holdmybeer. Rule #1 on /r/holdmybeer captures the essence of the entire ""holdmyXXXXX"" attitude:   Posts must include an example of a ""hold my beer"" moment. If the person in the video is a professional, or the feat occurs in a controlled environment, it likely isn't a ""hold my beer"" moment. Failure isn't required, but the high risk of failure should be present.   Now, you're probably thinking of the counterargument, ""Well, this isn't /r/holdmybeer, and we aren't beholden to their rules"". Correct, but the logic in the above rule from that sub still stands valid. The act being performed by a professional or in a well-controlled environment detracts from the ""hold my XXXXX"" aspect of the moment. Without the inherent danger or high risk of failure, this sub is simply a combination of /r/chemicalreactiongifs and /r/physics. Thus, as it stands, the name ""/r/holdmybeaker"" is misleading, and is throwing away the very essence of what makes it special.  TL;DR - Allowing content performed by professionals and/or in a well-controlled environment is going to make this sub lose what is supposed to make it unique in the first place and go to shit really quickly."

holdmybeaker,35mf26,jazzyt98,2,Tue May 12 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"At least it was a good excuse to show some footage of a huge vacuum chamber that I hadn't seen before.  Sadly, most people do not understand that things fall at the same rate. In undergrad I took the upper level intro physics classes (201, 202, etc instead of 101, 102). About two thirds of the class were surprised to see things drop at the same rate when we did those experiments in lab. It was a face palm moment for me."

I'm not 100% convinced yet, though.  Maybe see what happens if you vary the setup  and suspend the thermite well over the ice blocks.

I also used this reaction as the basis for one of my final projects in college a few years ago after it was discovered that this reaction produces graphene flakes, not just ordinary carbon.  Here are some pics."

holdmybeaker,339xi0,Svinnt,42,Mon Apr 20 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"I believe the dry ice is merely to contain the reaction and for a ""wow"" effect. When magnesium combusts it glows bright white whether in dry ice or not."
holdmybeaker,339xi0,Landoperk,3,Mon Apr 20 21:59:56 2015 UTC,"Magnesium requires oxygen to burn and the evaporating CO2 is going to displace any atmospheric oxygen.  The heat from the burning magnesium must be decomposing the CO2 into carbon and oxygen.  I am not sure the reaction, but I would guess that magnesium carbonate is one of the products."
holdmybeaker,339xi0,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Mon Apr 20 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, the reaction is so hot that it actually strips oxygen molecules from the CO2 which speeds up the reaction and leaves behind that black soot you can see at the end. When you burn magnesium just in air, you get a white solid only, no black soot."
holdmybeaker,339xi0,mvm92,30,Mon Apr 20 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"This is correct. The Mg is actually reacting with the carbon dioxide as the dry ice sublimates, creating magnesium oxide and carbon.  It should be noted this is a fairly unique reaction that showcases just how reactive Mg is. Normally in a combustion/oxidation, oxygen is the reactant. But even when there is no oxygen present, the magnesium STILL reacts with the carbon dioxide. This is also why magnesium fires cannot be put out with normal CO2 fire extinguishers"

holdmybeaker,328ltt,ThisVersionOfMyself,9,Sat Apr 11 17:31:49 2015 UTC,My guess is temperature.  The reaction is exothermic which is going to heat up the water which will then cause the reaction to proceed more quickly.   This is known as thermal  runnaway  Edit: Thanks for the gold!
holdmybeaker,328ltt,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Sat Apr 11 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"Thermal runaway:       Thermal runaway refers to a situation where an increase in temperature changes the conditions in a way that causes a further increase in temperature, often leading to a destructive result. It is a kind of uncontrolled positive feedback.  In other words, ""thermal runaway"" describes a process which is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In chemistry (and chemical engineering), this risk is associated with strongly exothermic reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In electrical engineering, thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in civil engineering, notably when the heat released by large amounts of curing concrete is not controlled. In astrophysics, runaway nuclear fusion reactions in stars can lead to nova and several types of supernova explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the ""helium flash"".  There are also concerns regarding global warming that a global average increase of 3-4 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline could lead to a further unchecked increase in surface temperatures due to positive feedback.

holdmybeaker,320h09,Eloquium,1 point,Fri May 1 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, where would one get a laser like that?"
holdmybeaker,320h09,ThatAstronautGuy,6,Fri Apr 10 04:25:43 2015 UTC,"Note that you can cause photochemical as well as thermal damage to yourself if it hits your skin, catastrophic permanent damage if it hits your eye. The blink reflex will not protect you. Looking at the spot on a wall is also dangerous. Additionally, a lot of objects that you might consider matte turn out to have a small specular component... but shine enough light on it and it's a hazard. Shine this on an unfortunately patterned surface, and you can get hazardous diffracted beams coming back at very unexpected angles. You can't ever use this in public or you'll probably end up in jail. What you see in the video is pretty much the only thing you can do with these: heat or burn darkly coloured things in an enclosed room, with (appropriate!) safety goggles. I doubt it'd cut paper as is. Thin black card very slowly maybe.  If you really want one I would suggest finding a nearby university and asking to sit on their next laser safety lecture first. The lectures can be quite fun actually. And hey, eyes don't grow back afaik!   On the whole I wouldn't recommend it though. I've already had some morons shine a low-ish powered green laser in my eyes while driving, out the back of a car ahead of mine. I can't comprehend the level of stupidity and wilful disregard for the lives of others that it would take to do shit like that."
holdmybeaker,320h09,viscence,2,Fri Apr 10 09:09:33 2015 UTC,IIRC it is against the law to shine lasers at people driving. Or at least it is a big fine from 3 different levels of government if you shine a pilot in the eye with a laser well they are flying.
holdmybeaker,320h09,ThatAstronautGuy,2,Fri Apr 10 11:45:59 2015 UTC,"If you shine it at a pilot while they're flying, and you get off with a fine, then some laws need changing."

It sounds like I should have kicked his ass though. He hit me and my dog with it multiple times before I decided to leave."
holdmybeaker,320h09,trose89,4,Sat Apr 11 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"Most commercially available laser pointers are limited to 5 mW power and are not at all dangerous unless you shine them directly into your eye.

holdmybeaker,320h09,smooth_randy,9,Fri Apr 10 01:36:16 2015 UTC,The reason the balloon doesn't pop is because it is clear/white. Lasers burn things because the thing absorbed the energy from the laser. A clear balloon let's the energy (mostly) pass through it and a white balloon simply reflects it. The darker the color (closer to black) something is the quicker it will absorb the energy and heat up. Think of a white car vs a black car in the sun. I think the myth busters did something like this you should be able to find.

holdmybeaker,320h09,lasernut,-5,Thu Apr 9 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"Luck. The balloon was pretty underinflated and, if you watch closely, at the end it's slowly deflating. That means it was punctured either at the neck or the top of the balloon where the skin wasn't under much tension, which allowed a slow deflation rather than a pop. If whatever caused the hole had hit the sides of the balloon, it would have popped. There's high-speed debris flying around in there, so the chances for a pop are high, but depend on how tightly inflated the balloon is and where it hits. So, just luck."
holdmybeaker,320h09,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"Looks more like particles (i.e. burnt gun powder dust) from the firecracker settled on the side of the transparent balloon. Those clinging particles would provide a surface that would absorb enough of the laser light's power to then burn a small hole in the balloon which due to it being underinflated meant that rather than popping, the little hole allowed the air to start escaping."
holdmybeaker,320h09,lasernut,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:10:52 2015 UTC,The balloon isn't underinflated enough to allow a hole on the sides that wouldn't pop it. It would have to like the size of an apple for that to happen. Something punctured it at the top or bottom where there's no tension.
holdmybeaker,320h09,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:15:04 2015 UTC,Definitely dust particles. Look at how clean the sides of the balloon are at first and then how cloudy they are very shortly after the firecracker explodes. The dust particles change the sides of the balloon from being transparent where the laser light can freely pass through to merely being clouded/translucent where the laser light can get a purchase and start burning (though not a fast burn as shown in this video that /u/oneofthetwo posted here earlier).
holdmybeaker,320h09,SSS427,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:33:47 2015 UTC,"Again, even very small holes in any part of a balloon under tension is not going to cause deflation, it will cause a pop. Just trust me. Experiment for yourself if you want proof."

There is a lot of potential, but very little actual energy.   Voltage increases danger but it doesn't create it. Furthermore something has to have  a minimum voltage to be dangerous.   Arc welding is very high amperage but low voltage. Because of this, human tissue has too high resistance (ohms)  for energy to travel through it. Metal, however, has low resistance, so you get a high amount of energy arcing between the welding rod and the metal being welded which melts/vaporizes together.   So in order to be zapped, you need enough voltage, but you also need enough amperage to do the damage (which is extremely low)"

It might be worth pointing out that the article & linked sources specify ""elemental liquid mercury,"" but the vapor is... not great for you. and it does evaporate at rt so like, it's kind of awesome that this guy might be less hurt from actually drinking mercury than standing above a big vat of it indoors.  eta: the injection thing is kind of interesting too; some dude injected a mL and a half of liquid elemental mercury just right in the arm and was fine, although I'm not sure that that source confirms that that injection ""failed to produce toxicity,"" especially since it says that the injection produced ""mild acute toxicity,"" whatever that means."

holdmybeaker,31ozaj,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"Acute toxicity:       Acute toxicity describes the adverse effects of a substance that result either from a single exposure  or from multiple exposures in a short space of time (usually less than 24 hours).  To be described as acute toxicity, the adverse effects should occur within 14 days of the administration of the substance.   Acute toxicity is distinguished from chronic toxicity, which describes the adverse health effects from repeated exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer time period (months or years).  It is widely considered unethical to use humans as test subjects for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be gained from investigating accidental human exposures (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or, more recently, in vitro testing methods and inference from data on similar substances.

holdmybeaker,31n4dt,markevens,6,Tue Apr 7 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Accident of article  Karen Wetterhahn:       On August 14, 1996, Wetterhahn, a specialist in toxic metals, was studying the way mercury ions interact with DNA repair proteins, and was using dimethylmercury as a standard reference material for 199Hg NMR measurements.  Dimethylmercury is a synthetic compound used almost exclusively as a reference standard in a particular type of specialized chemical analysis. Wetterhahn was investigating the toxic properties of another highly toxic heavy metal, cadmium.  Wetterhahn would recall that she had spilled one or two drops of dimethylmercury from the tip of a pipette onto her latex gloved hand. Not believing herself in any immediate danger, as she was taking all recommended precautions,  she proceeded to clean up the area prior to removing her protective clothing.  However, tests later showed that dimethylmercury can in fact rapidly permeate different kinds of latex gloves and enter the skin within about 15 seconds.  The exposure was later confirmed by hair testing, which showed a dramatic jump in mercury levels 17 days after the initial accident, peaking at 39 days, followed by a gradual decline.   Approximately three months after the initial accident Wetterhahn began suffering brief episodes of abdominal discomfort and noted a significant weight loss. The more distinctive neurological symptoms of mercury poisoning, including loss of balance and slurred speech, appeared in January 1997.  At this point tests proved that she was suffering from a debilitating mercury intoxication.    She was admitted to the hospital, where it was discovered that the single exposure to dimethylmercury had raised her blood mercury level to 4,000 micrograms per liter, or 80 times the toxic threshold. Her urinary mercury content had risen to 234 µg per liter; its normal range is from 1 to 5 and the toxic level is > 50 μg/L.

holdmybeaker,31n4dt,kaasmaniac,0,Tue Apr 7 08:51:36 2015 UTC,My point is that the fact that he's safely standing around a giant vat of mercury shows that the tiny amount found in a thermometer isn't going to harm the average person. It certainly isn't enough of a danger to ban them country-wide. It's just a ridiculous bubble-wrap societal response.
holdmybeaker,31n4dt,yeetboy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"So breathing, touching, eating/drinking of a substance should always give the same result? Maybe he can safely (he is probably a proffesional) stand there and breathe a little bit, but touching might be really dangerous. Or another point: lawsuits. People may file lawsuits for minor damages, so they banned the selling of thermometers. That's a possibility too."
holdmybeaker,31n4dt,kaasmaniac,0,Tue Apr 7 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"Obviously they don't necessarily have the same result, let's not be facetious.  But this is exactly my point. The uptake and absorption of liquid mercury and/or mercury vapour via contact with the skin (or, indeed, through the GI tract) is minimal and of no real medical consequence - unless we're talking about very large quantities. The real danger is via inhalation of mercury vapour. Unless you're cracking open a mercury thermometer, pouring it into a container and huffing it for hours on end, nothing is going to happen. And if you are, you deserve what you get because you're a moron.  The fear of lawsuits is destroying scientific curiosity. It's difficult enough to use chemicals in a controlled environment, never mind experimenting with (relatively) harmless chemicals in the general public. Many of us grew up with chemistry sets as children and loved it. Granted, some of the earlier ones (some actually had uranium!) were legitimately dangerous. But the ones when I was growing up (70s-80s) were quite safe - if you treated the chemicals with respect. Now good luck finding a kit that has anything stronger than vinegar and baking soda."

holdmybeaker,31ni5f,ftc08,12,Mon Apr 6 18:16:55 2015 UTC,The rust is being removed via infrared laser ablation. It only works if the substance to be ablated absorbs enough of its light energy to be heated up/vaporized. Since the man's fingers are essentially white they reflect nearly all of the laser light and thus so long as the fingers are moving rapidly enough through the laser light they are not burned.

holdmybeaker,3192es,CiDirkona,2,Sun Apr 12 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it was to do with heated air. Assuming the pipe is vertical (and the mesh is at the bottom), as the mesh at the bottom gets hotter, heat is transferred to the air nearby; having nowhere else to go, the heated air expands and rises (naturally) and creates pressure in the pipe, making sound as it escapes the top (?). Since hotter air is moving up the pipe, cooler air is drawn towards the bottom near the mesh. This doesn't happen when the pipe is horizontal because the hotter air goes to the top of the pipe and dissipates sideways down its' length, while simultaneously cool air on the bottom is drawn towards the mesh. Also on the other side of the mesh there is no pipe, so no pressure and air moves freely. Source:...."

holdmybeaker,318201,scorinth,3,Fri Apr 3 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend's dad has a great story about observing a California Condor nest for a week with his wife. This basically involved setting up a spotting scope on the rim of the Grand Canyon, pointing it at a small cave on a nearby part of the canyon wall, and settling in for many hours of just... sitting... waiting... and recording anything they saw.  There was some initial activity, but after a day or so they stopped seeing the birds at the cave entrance. At first, he didn't think anything of it, but over time he grew concerned, and then eventually, bored. They still took shifts; he would watch the cave for an hour or two, with his worry and boredom slowly growing, and then his wife would watch for an hour or two, and as long as it was bright enough to see the cave, at least one of them was watching. Finally, the day was done and the couple of park rangers went home for the night.  The next day, it was pretty much the same story. They set up their observation post, sat down, and waited for signs of activity in the cave. Now, being park rangers, their job isn't just to do science, but also to educate and, to a certain extent, entertain visitors, so while the wife kept up with the observations of the cave, the husband brought a second scope and kept himself busy interacting with the public - showing visitors what they were doing, while keeping them from interfering with the important scientific research his wife was doing. This kept him sane despite the complete lack of activity on the part of the birds they were watching.  The next day was more of the same, but by now, even chatting with park guests was starting to grow tiresome - he loved having the chance to answer questions, tell stories, and so on, but he was still stuck at their observation post all day to assist his wife, even when he wasn't looking through the scope himself.  Eventually, toward the end of the third idle day without activity, he had nothing else to distract himself with and finally noticed something odd. While he was watching the cave, nothing happened, and so there was nothing to record, but when it was his wife's turn to take watch, she was still writing just as much in the log book as she did when the condors were putting on a show. His frustration came to a head.  ""What are you doing? Nothing is happening! Nothing has been happening for three days now! What in the world could you be writing in that book?""  ""Well,"" she said, as she calmly held the log book up for her husband to see, ""I've been writing that nothing has been happening for three days now."" And sure enough, there it was: Line after line of her handwritten observations, recording with meticulous attention to detail that absolutely nothing interesting had been visible at the cave.  When he tells the story, this is where the husband sighs in defeat and admits that he will never be half the scientist she was."

holdmybeaker,30xo8x,joshuaoha,11,Wed Apr 1 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"Please note that making or possessing a dry ice bomb is illegal in many locations and can carry felony charges even if you manage not to hurt anyone.  When made with a 2-L carbonated beverage bottle it is a powerful explosive with a dangerously unpredictable fuse--get the proportions of air, water and dry ice right and it can still blow up in your face because of a flaw in the $0.02 plastic bottle you're using.  Get the proportions wrong and you're almost guaranteed disaster or a long, nerve-wracking wait during which you have to make sure nobody goes near the device.    The PVC mortar is much more dangerous, as you've added another layer of containment and so increased the potential pressure of the explosion if you've got a flaw in your PVC.  If you're set on making a potato cannon, don't use a dry ice bomb as a propellant and for fuck's sake don't use PVC--it's one of the worst possible materials for pressure work as it fails explosively.  Use ABS and make DAMN sure you know its pressure rating.    Lastly if you're an educator and you really want a big boom for a demo, use liquid nitrogen instead--it lets you leave more head space, reducing the chance of it blowing up in your hands--and DO IT OUTSIDE unless you've got 1500 ping pong balls laying around to help muffle the blast: this motherfucker is LOUD."
holdmybeaker,30xo8x,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Tue Mar 31 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"For those who don't know, the problem with PVC is that when it fails it shatters into sharp pointy shards which are ejected with considerable momentum.  PVC also becomes much more brittle at low temperatures, thus increasing the likelyhood of failure.  And finally, PVC weakens with age and pressure-cycling.  Perhaps the worst problem with PVC is that people become complacent using it in non-specified applications such as this."

It looks like a simple firecracker has more explosive power than this gold substance, and there's probably only at most something like 3 times more explosive material in a firecracker. So this gold material is at most something like 3 times more explosive than black powder, which is definitely cool, but not quite as crazy as they were talking about it.   If I'm wrong about my guesses here, definitely please correct me."
holdmybeaker,30r6eh,BreadIsTheEnemy,2,Mon Mar 30 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"You've got a point, but you also have to look at it from a power/energy per mol perspective. With a molecular mass around 500g/mol, even if the same mass of lead azide (mol mass=250) produced the same result, the gold explosive did twice as much per mol.   Or, (anyone correct me if I'm wrong too) the equivalent mol amount of black powder for the last explosion is about 0.0187g. Can 19mg easily blow a hole in a can?"

holdmybeaker,30r6eh,RFeldhake,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:41:53 2015 UTC,In what way is it interestingly sensitive?  There are many types of explosives that're detonated only by heat or electricity but not mechanical impacts.

It's just that none of them are simple syntheses like this one that you can easily make in your backyard (Note: DON'T MAKE THIS IN YOUR BACKYARD!).  Fulminated gold made by this process (with pure gold--see my note above ) is remarkably stable by the standards of ""shit I cooked up in my backyard,"" not by the standards of TNT or C4."
holdmybeaker,30r6eh,joshuaoha,13,Mon Mar 30 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!  If your sample of gold is contaminated with even a little silver (and most jewelry gold is, in fact, mixed with silver) the resulting product will be much more unstable, as fulminating silver is horrendously more shock-sensitive.    And that's assuming you're an experienced enough chemist that you won't injure yourself with the aqua regia or ammonia, both of which are fairly nasty shit if you're attempting to breathe anywhere in their close vicinity.    If you're dumb (and rich) enough to do this, be sure you follow their example--despite their choice of soundtrack music, these guys are not actually idiots: they're using purified gold, only handling this stuff in milligram quantities, and never handling it directly."

holdmybeaker,30lted,jargoone,17,Sat Mar 28 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"1) What type of content do you want here  Some type of science experiment or demo that goes wrong, or appears to go wrong.  I don't care if it a real mistake, something that appears to a mistake to shock the audience, or something completely staged as on a TV show.    2) Are the rules not strict enough or too strict  I think we should have as few rules as possible, and only add more rules when a certain type of post is hurting the sub.  The primary rule of /r/holdmybeer could easily be applied to this sub.   I. Posts must include an example of a ""hold my beer"" moment. If the person in the video is a professional, or the feat occurs in a controlled environment, it likely isn't a ""hold my beer"" moment. Failure isn't required, but the high risk of failure should be present.   Obviously the laboratory environment will be appropriate in this sub.   3) What do you want out of the moderators  Objective moderation with no drama.  If someone is violating rule #3, remove the comment with a replied comment that explains why the post was removed.    ELI5 questions should be in the comments, not as a new post.  If they want an explanation then go to /r/ELI5 or /r/askscience"
holdmybeaker,30lted,iShootDope_AmA,3,Sat Mar 28 19:51:21 2015 UTC,Very well articulated comment thank you very much!  I like your suggestion of a quick comment to explain why the comment was removed. Personally I am not in the habit of removing comments unless they are particularly hurtful. With that said reporting comments makes it much easier for us to find these comments and act accordingly so please report anything you find harmful!  I think my post about the ELI5 was not as clear as it could have been. I have been doing ELI5 and more detailed Scientific comments for most posts. These are in the comments of the post they are for not a separate post. I have a degree in Biochemistry and Chemistry so I should be able to explain most posts with out people having to leave the subreddit.  Again thank you for your comment!

If you can get it, lycopodium powder works even better.    It’s a good demonstration for showing the effect of particle size on reaction rate—light the creamer in a dish and nothing much happens, but get it spread out in air and the results are spectacular.

This is a popular demo because the synthesis is easy, but it can also be very dangerous.  I'm not going to give you the recipe--you can look that shit up in Shakhashiri yourself if you've got any business doing this--but I am going to pass on some safety tips:  IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY THIS:   Nitrogen triiodide is much more safe to handle when wet with ammonia, but it has been known to detonate even when wet, so NEVER MAKE MORE THAN A GRAM OR TWO AT A TIME--any more than that and you take a small but real risk of being blinded or losing fingers.   Make what you're going to use WHERE you're going to use it.  NEVER attempt to store this chemical, even when wet.  If you put it into a sealed container you have just made a bomb that can go off unpredictably at any time! Those cool purple clouds you see are Iodine gas, one of the decomposition products and very nasty shit if inhaled.  Aways set this up where there is good ventilation, preferably in a working fume hood.   CLEAN YOUR GLASSWARE RIGHT AWAY - rinse any residue off your glassware and stirring rod off onto the filter paper containing the crystals you're going to let dry.  By now you should realize why it's a bad idea to let this shit dry out on glass! It'll leave iodine stains around the area where you detonate it--these can be cleaned up with a dilute solution of sodium thiosulfate.     Edit: added a link to Shakhashiri's handbook of chemical demonstrations, aka ""The Bible"" to us chemistry nerds."

holdmybeaker,307gq5,squishyburger,14,Wed Mar 25 05:08:36 2015 UTC,"ELI5: Chemicals are poured into soapy water. When the chemicals mix they produce a large amount of gas very rapidly. This gas creates the foam and produces a significant amount of heat.  Science: This reaction is commonly known as elephant toothpaste. It is most commonly done by mixing conc. hydrogen peroxide, 30% or higher (H2O2), with soap and then adding potassium iodide. H2O2 normally will break down into water and oxygen gas (O2) but this is a slow process. The potassium iodide catalyzes the reaction. The reaction has a negative ΔH value of −196 kJ/mol. This means the reaction is exothermic. The reaction equation is as followed.   H2O2    +   I−    → H2O +   IO− H2O2    +   IO−   → H2O +   O2  +   I−    2H2O2           → 2H2O(l) +   O2(g) ΔrH° = −196 kJ/mol  The reason this is a ""troll"" is it appears that this is a student doing the reaction. The student has no personal protection equipment (ppe) and seems to be under the impression that nothing will happen until she adds what ever is in the spoon in her other hand. This is very dangerous as the reaction is exothermic and could cause burns not to mention the hazardous properties of conc. H2O2."

holdmybeaker,307gq5,RFeldhake,10,Wed Mar 25 04:33:08 2015 UTC,Well said--this teacher is a menace.  Looking at this again I'm thinking this was more like 50% or 70% peroxide to produce such a violent reaction.  Not giving your student goggles when you know that's coming at them...the sheer amount of science teacher ignorance of safety I'm seeing on this sub is really starting to bother me.
holdmybeaker,307gq5,RFeldhake,3,Wed Mar 25 04:08:40 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing but as with all my explanations I like to play it on the safe side.

holdmybeaker,301ipo,BunBun002,36,Tue Mar 24 01:33:37 2015 UTC,Could you explain like I'm 5 what is happening here.
holdmybeaker,301ipo,FaithfulMongrel,4,Mon Mar 23 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"ELI5: The container is filled with a super saturated solution. When you heat water you are able to dissolve more stuff into it as compared to room temperature or cold water. Once you have heated the water and ""super saturated"" it you slowly cool it being careful to not disturb it in any way. Once cooled all it needs is a surface to start forming crystals on. This can be done by placing a seed crystal (a small amount of the original substance) or in this case a hand.   As stated this reaction gives off a fair amount of heat so replicating this video would be a bad idea. Doing this with a seed crystal can be quite fun though! If you place the crystal on a plate and pour the solution onto it you can ""pour"" solid towers out!"
holdmybeaker,301ipo,JRoch,8,Tue Mar 24 01:24:11 2015 UTC,"Sure thing!  That ""water"" he dipped his hand into is a chemical that has been jam packed into water to the point that it is so delicate, one little tap could cause it to turn into a solid.  When he did, that white stuff is the chemical being forced out of the ""water"" and turning to a solid and producing LOTS of heat in the process.  If you've ever used a instant hot pack for a sore muscle, this is what causes it to work."

holdmybeaker,301ipo,luxchroma,16,Mon Mar 23 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"So I've gotten in arguments with complete and utter morons other chemists about what is actually happening here,  Basically, the solution is cooled to the point that the sodium acetate wants to crystalize, which would involve a phase change. The thing is, changing phase actually doesn't happen randomly all to readily, even when it would be thermodynamically favored. When this guy puts his hand in the water, the rough surface of his hand increases the surface area available for the crystallization, which catalyzes the phase change (and then the crystal itself becomes a catalyst, and the whole process accelerates). Here are other examples.  *Edit: wrong video..."
holdmybeaker,301ipo,TheFatMistake,7,Mon Mar 23 23:04:32 2015 UTC,"As a chemist complete and utter moron, I can tell you exactly what happened here.  Lolz. Lolz happened."
holdmybeaker,301ipo,luxchroma,21,Tue Mar 24 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"He coats his fingers in crystals of sodium acetate before he submerges his hand into the solution.  This also provides nucleation sites for the supersaturated solution to precipitate in the jar, yo"
holdmybeaker,301ipo,benevolentpotato,17,Mon Mar 23 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"That would also do it, and is, in general the best way of inducing crystallization, but actually probably isn't necessary. In the lab, we use a technique similar to this to induce crystallization as a means of purifying solids. We often scrape our glassware to create microscopic glass fragments that act as nucleation sites. 60% of the time, it works every time."
holdmybeaker,301ipo,luxchroma,2,Mon Mar 23 23:31:52 2015 UTC,Can testify. I used to do this all the time as a student when lab necessitated crystallization. Totally works.
holdmybeaker,301ipo,benevolentpotato,57,Thu Mar 26 04:44:30 2015 UTC,He's making hot ice. Dipping his hand in the solution (disturbing it) caused an exothermic reaction and the crystalline structure created hot ice.  Source: Not a chemist and plagiarizing /u/SirTickleTots.

Thankfully, what is/isn’t an appropriate use of our freshwater lakes seems to have evolved a bit since the late 1940’s.  The unfortunate scene of this science experiment is Lake Lenore in eastern Washington State. While the effusive narrator states “the alkali lake is devoid of fish and forms an admirable disposal spot,” it’s hard to imagine no negative impacts from an addition of 10 tons of metallic sodium to the water. Besides, the “devoid of fish” remark isn’t exactly true, at least not today. Today Lake Lenore (also known as Lenore Lake) is a popular spot for fly fishermen chasing cutthroat trout. Just don’t drink the water.  This post-World War II footage was being showcased on Discover magazine’s “Bad Astronomy” blog where blogger Randall Munrion explains the highly entertaining reactions, writing:  “Sodium is highly reactive. It’s way over on the left side of the periodic table, which means it really wants to give an extra electron to any receptive atom or molecule that happens by. Water will happily accept that electron, but at a cost: the reaction creates sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). It also generates a lot of extra energy in the form of heat. A lot. And there’s hydrogen around. Remember the Hindenburg?”  Today, lakes don’t need to worry about the “War Assets Administration,” rolling explosive barrels down their banks. Sodium, however, hasn’t been tabled as a threat. Nowadays it gets into the water as a crucial component to road salt. The effect is less telegenic, but probably a bigger threat."

As someone who is a scientist who studies Bacon, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Prociutto bacon. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""suine meat"" you're referring to the gastronomic group of Delicious Pork, which includes things from Ham to Smoked Pork to Gammon. So your reasoning for calling a Prosciutto bacon is because random people ""call prepared pork belly bacon?"" Let's get pork crackle and Pancetta in there, then, too. Also, calling a steak cow meat or beef? It's not one or the other, that's not how gastronomy works. They're both. Prosciutto is Prosciutto and a member of the Bacon family. But that's not what you said. You said a Prosciutto is Bacon, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all parts of the pig bacon, which means you'd call Ham, Smoked Pork, and other parts Bacon too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

And the downvotes are just evidence of this.  None of you have anything legitimate to say beyond some tired ass criticism based on something you heard somewhere else.

holdmybeaker,2zze0b,the_rev1995,15,Tue Mar 24 15:29:30 2015 UTC,"Leidenfrost effect:       The Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly. This is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point (but still above boiling temperature). The effect is also responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It has also been used in some potentially dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead  or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.  The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.

This is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point (but still above boiling temperature). The effect is also responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It has also been used in some potentially dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead  or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.  The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.

As long as there is no metal in contact with your skin (and we always remove any metal jewellery/belts/watches/etc before handling) you are usually fine for at least 5s or so of contact.  Still wouldn't do it on purpose, especially with the risk of hair/ears/eyes catching it and keeping it in contact with your skin (which is  where the burns usually come in)."
holdmybeaker,2zze0b,corbs132,18,Mon Mar 23 09:29:35 2015 UTC,What happens if you forget to remove metal?
holdmybeaker,2zze0b,SchroedingersHat,2,Mon Mar 23 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Metal has a high thermal conductivity and relatively low heat capacity. This means it can get very cold, relatively quickly and will rapidly absorb heat from something it comes into contact with. This can result in burns before you can react or get it off of you.  It can also cool enough that the nitrogen stops boiling on contact, then it starts cooling much more rapidly because it is in contact with liquid nitrogen. So something like a ring can cause burns much more rapidly than direct skin contact, too."

holdmybeaker,300yit,Badfiish,5,Mon Mar 23 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"Hi - H.S. science teacher here. It's actually a friend of mine's demonstration. It's to show the effects of atmospheric pressure (specifically the difference in pressure), and just much of a force is actually applied to our bodies!  Here is how this demonstration works:  A 55 gallon drum is filled with water. A few liters is all you need. With the barrel unsealed, you boil the water inside, creating steam. You then remove the heat and seal the barrel. This ""begins the process of cooling the barrel and its contents. This causes the steam in the barrel to condense into water, thus significantly reducing the volume of the contents. When this takes place, the pressure is lowered inside the barrel, and now the atmospheric pressure outside the barrel will be much greater than the pressure inside. It turns out that the barrel can withstand about 9 pounds per square inch difference, but beyond that it is simply too much pressure for the metal to withstand and it collapses.""   - Paraphrased some of my notes from UMN physics website.  Hope this helps!"

holdmybeaker,2zysvv,brokenkitty,3,Tue Mar 24 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"To achieve a criticality you need to produce more neutrons in the system than you lose. Plutonium is pretty good at producing these neutrons and certain materials (like beryllium) are very good at reflecting neutrons back into the system. When the beryllium spheres are separated by the screwdriver there are enough neutrons leaking through the crack, and thereby leaving the system, to keep it subcritical. But once the crack is gone enough reactivity is added by the reflected neutrons to send the system prompt super critical."

Dust has a massive surface area compared to a solid block that allows for the dust to burn with a much smaller amount of energy then required to burn a block of the same material. Some common examples are grain dust, coal dust, non-dairy coffee creamer, and saw dust. In order for this to happen the following criteria must be met.   1) A combustible dust  2) The dust is suspended in the air at a high concentration  3) The dust cloud is confined  4) There is an oxidant (typically atmospheric oxygen)  5) There is an ignition source  This is a cool yellow flame in a lab so my best guess is methane (CH3) burning. After /u/david171971 's comment and further inspection of the photo it does look like it is a fine powder burning.

It ensures you don't drift forward into the path of the pendulum! Also there is no loss of energy other than to air friction. The reason you see folks do this with very large masses ia because it provides a greater pool of energy to draw from. ideally it goes right back to where it started.

This means that there is no way for the ball to hit him in the face unless he adds energy by pushing it for example.   EDIT: thank you to /u/redlaWw for the better explanation! The reason the ball breaks the glass is he gave the ball a push, which gives it initial kinetic energy. This means there is more total energy that can be converted into gravitational potential energy and the ball is able to go higher than its initial position, thus still having some kinetic energy when it impacts the glass.

This costs energy, not a lot but just a tiny little bit.  Because the ball loses a tiny little bit of energy when swinging, it will swing just a little less far every time it goes back and forth because how far it goes depends on how much energy it has!  More and ELI 8-10 ish but whatever."

Also inside, to test a secondary theory - static electricity - they came up with a ""panty-static generator"" that rubbed a pair of panties on a fur-covered car seat (simulating a woman getting into and out of a car - something they decided on since they did a stakeout and found women are six times more likely to re-enter their cars while refueling) and transferred the static electricity to a Leyden jar.  However, the first test was a failure on both counts, so the two of them scaled back down to find the right mixture.   It was during one of these tests that confirmed that static electricity combined with a potent fuel-air mixture could cause an explosion that Adam singed off his eyebrow - and, according to Jamie, a chunk of his hair.  With renewed vigor and knowledge of proper fuel-air mixtures, they returned to the Stoke Gas Museum, but found that both the cell phone and panty-static generator did not cause explosions even with large amounts of the ideal fuel-air mixture inside the chamber, thus busting the myth.   They did finally get an explosion when they added a neon transformer to the chamber, which blew the chamber into two halves and left the car seat on fire (Adam and Jamie had wired the chamber with a fail point so that it would be a safe failure and not cause shrapnel in case of a large explosion.)  They found that the actual risk comes from an electrostatic discharge between a charged driver and the car, often a result of static electricity buildup from getting into and out of the vehicle and re-busted the myth in Myths Revisited."

So, I went back to relight it, and in doing so accidentally applied the fire to the thermite directly, whilst it was inches in front of my face.

holdmybeaker,2zxyhr,DontSayNoToPills,15,Mon Mar 23 01:22:09 2015 UTC,ELI5: He tried to create a simple jet engine type reaction. His problem was to much fuel not enough oxygen. When it finally reacted it drew in massive amounts of oxygen and reacted all at once causing an explosion.  Science: When gas burns it expands rapidly. If you direct this expanding gas out of a narrow opening you create a directional force. In order to burn something there has to be a proper ratio of fuel to oxygen but here the fuel was saturated. Once enough oxygen finally entered the container all of the fuel reacted at once instead of gradually. This is what caused the explosion.  this is what the reaction should have looked like.

Lighting a fire in a glass container without putting it behind an explosion shield;  Not wearing eye protection.     Seriously, if you're a teacher, NEVER do an energetic reaction (sodium in water, sugar & chlorate, etc.) in front of students without putting an explosion shield in front of it.  Maybe you've done it ten years straight with never a hitch--doesn't mean that it won't blow up on you this time landing you in the news like this poor guy linked elsewhere in the sub.  When you're dealing with fast deflagration, crazy freak circumstances can unpredictably turn it into an explosion, and you need to use some easy, sensible precautions to make sure your students are safe if it does."

holdmybeaker,2zzf0q,CountDeMomo,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:22:29 2015 UTC,"I suppose I could try ELI5ing this (what with the other guy seemingly being a chemist and all).  For simplicity's sake, we're going to assume that it's direct current (alternating current is more likely, but it's more complicated and isn't significantly different in this case) and that the input voltage is the voltage across the heater (i.e. no resistors.  If there are resistors, the component voltage is still proportional, so it doesn't really matter.  Voltage in a circuit is basically the energy that charge has to flow.  Components resist this flow with a quantity called resistance, so the current (the rate at which charge flows) in a circuit is the applied voltage divided by the resistance.  Thus, as you increase the voltage across the circuit, the current increases.  The heater emits energy at some rate, which is known as the power.  By the definition of voltage, power is voltage times current.  Since we know that the current is the voltage divided by the resistance, we can show that the power is proportional to the square of the voltage.  This means that as we increase the voltage, the rate at which the toaster heats the toast increases rapidly, resulting in significantly shorter cooking times.  TL;DR:  High voltages give circuit lots of energy, which makes it heat very fast."

holdmybeaker,2zwzqf,mw2dude2010,8,Mon Mar 23 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"ELI5: baking soda and vinegar when combined rapidly produce a gas. The gas expands with more force then the bottle can contain and it blows up.  Science: With out knowing exactly what reagents are being used I am guessing the most simple of them being baking soda (NaHCO3) and vinegar (CH3COOH and water). When you combine these two a great amount of CO2 (g) is produced rapidly. As you can see the gas rapidly expands and bursts the plastic bottle.   Another common way to do this is dry ice and water but this is not the case because one of the reagents is a powder.  As you see in the video they are both putting their face over the bottle and various points. Please never do this as it is dangerous even if there is ""nothing"" in the bottle. It is just bad lab safety!!"
holdmybeaker,2zwzqf,SSS427,3,Sun Mar 22 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"I've never seen baking soda and vinegar have such a violent reaction before. I don't think it's possible to blow a bottle that fast with those two reagents. I'd guess more on sodium hydroxide, aluminium and water."
holdmybeaker,2zwzqf,arebokert,2,Mon Mar 23 00:47:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said in the ""science"" explanation I do not know the exact reagents being used but I know the general reaction that is happening. It is safer to assume more simple reactions rather than more complicated ones. This is not to say you are incorrect and in fact I would tend to agree with what you said but the reaction scheme I presented is for general learning and in this case baking soda and vinegar provide a solid base for what is going on."

holdmybeaker,2zygpi,DenverBecca,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:06:38 2015 UTC,ELI5: The iphone didnt react quickly because the metal in it undergoes a process to protect it from corrosion. Science: Iphones are anodized which means a surface layer of amorphous metal oxide is produced to combat corrosion. This is not fool proof especially in low pH conditions because of micro fissures in the surface of the oxide. Various tecniques have been developed to combat this but that is outside of my range of knowledge. A typical acid metal reaction is as follows: acid plus metal produces salt plus hydrogen gas or Cu(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CuCl2(aq) + H2(g). Keep in mind that is for pure metals only an acid reaction with an oxide like in the video would be as follows: acid plus metal oxide also produces salt and water or CuO(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CuCl2(aq) + H2O(g)
holdmybeaker,2zx5ih,dbaliki918,2,Sun Mar 22 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"copied this from my other thermite explanation.  ELI5: rust and the stuff inside an etch a sketch react when heated and burn at temperatures around 2500 °C (~4500F). This is used to weld railroad ties together or cut cars in half  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIpa1K51os4  Science: Iron(III) oxide and aluminum powder are the most common ways of doing this reaction so my numbers will be based on that. What is happening is the aluminium reduces the oxide of the Iron(III) oxide producing aluminium oxide, elemental iron, and a metric shit ton (actual science term) of heat Fe2O3 + 2 Al → 2 Fe + Al2O3. When mixed in the proper ratios thermite is very stable. It takes a lot of energy to start the reaction. What happens in this video is a butane torch is used to light a ribbon of magnesium (that bright white light). magnesium burns at 3,100 °C (5,610 °F) which is plenty of energy to start the reaction."

The reason for the explosion could be many but my guess is there is way to much thermite in the clay pot and the reaction over flows the clay pot. Also the distance between the pot and the catching container is way to high. This is liquid iron that is pouring out you dont want that splashing around. Also I heard some popping noises that sound like water super heating and expanding but I am not sure about that but it could be from the clay pot having water in it."
