IMO, it's innovative because it will, eventually, be the skeleton with which they truly deliver energy storage with a home battery, in an effective manner. Innovation doesn't mean something has to be a brand new idea, that's just straight up creation of new ideas to me. I feel you though.  Also, yes, Hyperloop is Space X, but Musk is both, and when I'm talking innovation, I'm almost talking Musk rather than simply Tesla. But I didn't say that, or even infer that, so my bad.

The things brewing in the head of Musk, combined with a bit of financial might, and some seriously smart cohorts, are creating an innovative stream of conscious from Tesla (and Space X) that is seemingly structured for long term innovation and market share, rather than simply short term, i.e.; sales and revenue rn.

stocks,3e3fwz,RationalHeretic23,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:50:25 2015 UTC,"The batteries and their software.  The update that allows 0-60 in 2.8s is largely a software update to their battery that allows for a much more efficient and lower heat of the battery.    They achieved something no other production combustion car has ever achieved: 0-60 in 2.8s.  Not only that, but incredibly efficient -- much more than any hybrid, and a good amount more than any electric car.  The range is drastically higher than any electric car out there.  The batteries rapidly charge faster than any electric car.  Basically, the Tesla is now the fastest and most efficient production vehicle. Ever. They proved the technology is beyond feasible.  They have the eyes and ears of every car enthusiast right now, which prior to Tesla - electric cars were thought of little hippie oversized golf carts.    They've been around only a few years.  They'll continue to get more efficient and higher performance.  Combustion vehicles have been around over 100 years, and quarter million dollar+ exotic cars aren't even as fast as a $100k sedan.    Elon set out to prove it wasn't a fad and that electric can not only be more efficient than combustion, but higher performance.  His car is the top of both now.  Toyota, Ford, Honda, BMW, etc have billions and years ahead of them, and they couldn't do that.  Chevy went bankrupt trying to do something like it with the Volt... after trying/failing multiple times in the past.  And the Volt is basically just a glamorous hybrid in power and efficiency.    So is it a good investment? Fuck yes it is.  Short term? No. It's an innovative company.  Every announcement from Tesla that comes out brings them higher demand from consumers saying, ""JUST GET US THE GOD DAMN MODEL 3 ALREADY!""   The only limitation by the time the 3 comes out that Tesla will have is production.  In a few years, a sub $40k car that runs on pure electric with a highly supported infrastructure for a car that does 200-300 miles per charge?  Elon is fighting a huge establishment. He's fighting the most American industry of the 20th century.  He's embarrassing them right now.  He has the hearts of the generations under 40.  There's very few vehicles out there on the horizon outside of vaporware that can hold a candle to Tesla's technology.  BMW would be just about the only one at this point.  So why is it a great investment? I wouldn't dump your life savings into it, but a decent amount to it would be great.  If the X and especially the 3 succeed, Tesla has potential to be the Apple of the automotive industry.  But there's already a big enough established infrastructure and customer base that Tesla isn't going anywhere in the near future.  Worst case scenario is they get purchased, and your investment does fine anyways.    Finally, those doubting the powerwall? That's a huge factor as well.  Once they start selling those, major businesses that have any sort of renewable energy or producing their own energy (such as hospitals with generators and such) will make a huge use of them.    tl;dr: Tesla has major potential to be an incredible investment so early.  You may not see a huge return within the next year... 2 years.. hell, even 5 years - but I believe it'll be the next company in 10-20 years that people look back and say, ""fuck - I should I put a few bucks in it back in the 2010s."""

The amount of tech ""innovation"" TSLA can produce in 5 years, major automakers can do it in 2 years. Main reason why they countinue to sit on the sidelines making these small electric car prototypes. They are nothing, nothing to buy.  Google has more innovation going for it with self-driving cars (traffic reduction) then TSLA has with luxurious cars.   Nissan's Leaf targets the average human consumer to buy a car that is electric. The Leaf gets 84m range, tesla hits 200m. Leaf $30k, tsla $70k  84m range is literally ideal. Commuters find this within their price range and mileage range making ideal to but a leaf over a tesla.

I mean, if you think like the – I mean, sort of right down the palm, like the cell is a chemical engineering problem. It's like a little can of chemicals and then the module and pack problem is a mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering problem.  And if you have a just like a small number of cells, then as an overall engineering problem, it's like mostly about the cell. But once you have a lot of cells, then the intellectual property challenge, or you know, the intellectual challenge becomes more at the mechanical, electrical and software level, which is where Tesla does quite well. That's why you don't really see like nobody else is like has a pack like ours.   (This is from a transcript of an earnings call, sorry if it's butchered).   Anyway, Tesla also has the highest energy density batteries in the automotive industry at the moment, and the lowest cost batteries (about $250/kWh versus $400-$500/kWh for other automakers).

Tesla's Model S and Model X platform has been incredibly successful, and if the Model 3 platform is HALF as successful, then Tesla could easily see demand for 500,000 cars in 2020. So that leaves the question of capital to expand production capabilities to 500k. Given how successful the Model S/X have been, it's easy to see that Tesla has plenty of revenues, cash, and access to capital (Stock market, government loans, etc) to ramp up production of the Model 3.

While other automakers are out fishing for customers, Tesla literally has fish jumping into their boat with the Model X, which is still to be revealed (production version, that is). People love the concept of the X so much that they are willing to plop down either $5k or $40k to be on a reservation list, if that's not a set up for success, I don't know what is. Sure, there is still some risk that the Model X could flop upon release, but Elon Musk called it a better SUV than the Model S was a sedan, and the Model S has been pretty successful. Also, very few products flop upon release after having successful concepts/prototypes, so the Model X more likely than not will continue its success."

It wasn't actually a failure in production ramp that caused Tesla to miss in Q3, it was a production line upgrade that took longer than expected. It was a very minor mistake that caused a short term miss. To think that a short term miss indicates that Tesla will miss their long term guidance is foolish."

stocks,3e3fwz,way2lazy2care,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:53:01 2015 UTC,"Production ramp is getting a line from X amount of cars in T amount of time to Y amount of cars in T amount of time, where Y is greater than X. Construction of a new line and or improvements to an existing line does not constitute a production ramp. Once that new/upgraded line opens and goes from X cars in T time to Y cars in T time, then you are discussing a production ramp.   I should also point out that Tesla's time line for the Model 3 isn't as easily compromised as previous time lines, for example, Tesla has already built out the paint shop successfully to a capacity of 500k cars/year, meanwhile, the Model 3 is a bit more than 2 years out. Tesla will start building out the body in white line and the assembly line at the beginning of 2016, about 1.5 years before Model 3 launch, so they have been scheduling with plenty of cushion time. As for the production ramp, I don't see how going from 100k to 500k cars from 2016 to 2020 is as impossibly hard as you and others make it out to be."

I don't think it's crazy to imagine powering our cars with electric in the near future and solar in the long term.  In fact, I see the same fan based enthusiasm for Tesla that I saw in the early days of the iPod and iPhone.  Once people see their neighbor never going to the gas station again combined with a (hopefully) beautifully designed model 3 - why not believe that it will be disruptive?    Add to that the battery production not just in a home setting but commercial applications and there is a lot to bet on.

Is Apple the only company that sells phones and MP3 players.  No - but thats the point.  They introduced a disruptive technology that changed everything.  Nobody that is betting on Tesla thinks that they'll be the only ones producing electric cars.  Musk has actually stated that they look forward to (and need) other companies to manufacture electric cars for it to work on a larger scale.  74 million cars are sold per year globally.

IBM didn't meet expectations, which cast a pall on the tech market. The post-coital glow of Netflix and Google was erased by IBM's falter, right before Apple.   Apple was also up quite a bit in anticipation of earnings, so you could argue the next day or two will ""correct"" back to what its value should be.   But ultimately, my opinion would be: don't sell. You have shares of Apple, which as you said just had a pretty good report. It'll go up eventually. Next time you can sell prior to earnings and buy in the dip afterward.

stocks,3e3siz,fatmanbatman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"that depends. Say stock x trades at 99, and you set a buy limit of 100, your broker will, given that there is enoguh liquidity, buy your shares right away at 99. However, in Googles case, where the price increase was due to an earnings report, that´s a different story. They reported after the market closed, so if you entered a buy limit of say 600, you cant expect your broker to give them to you for 600 the following day because the stock gapped up on the open (680).   So no, the limit wont kick in at 120 because you instructed that you do not want to pay more than 100 for that stock."
stocks,3e3siz,Bluearrow125,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:46 2015 UTC,if x trades at 99 and you put in limit order for 100$...it will be filled immediately as a market order since price is </= to 100$.
stocks,3e3siz,koolbro2012,2,Tue Jul 21 20:44:22 2015 UTC,"when it starts rising, it buys   That is not what a limit order does. In fact, the exact opposite. Order will only execute at or below limit price, so it would actually be when the price starts falling, it buys (if price was originally above limit price, otherwise it will attempt to buy immediately). What you described is a stop buy order.   will the limit order kick in at 100$ or at 120$   $100, but if the price moves above $100 too quickly, you may only get a partial fill.   And can a share make a big jump in 1 second?   Can make them in less than a second."

stocks,3e3siz,ghostofgbt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can do that with a buy stop. Think of a stop order like a trigger: Say you want to buy when the stock breaks $100 and it's currently at $99. You would set a buy stop with a stop price of $100. When the price hits $100, the stop will turn into a market order to buy, which could get filled at $100 if the shares are available, but you may (actually most likely will, since market orders buy on the ask) get some at a higher price if the stock is rising quickly. If you want to protect yourself from that upside ""slippage"" you can use a buy stop LIMIT order, which would ask you for a stop price and a limit price. In that way you could say, current price is $99, set buy stop at $100 with a limit of $100.50. When the price hits $100, it will turn into a limit to buy at $100.50 or lower instead of turning into a market order, so it will fill at $100, $100.25, $100.35, etc up to $100.50 but if the stock instantly spikes from $100 to $105 you won't end up with $5 in slippage and a shitty price."

EBay's Financials were padded because of PayPal numbers being included in It. Now that they are seperate, Ebay is going to have to preform.

Couple things to consider: 1) are you comfortable with the funds' fees? 2) do you know which stocks are in the fund and are happy with the allocation?  I personally don't like the inclusion of SYMC and CSCO to name a couple. They each make up 4% of the fund and while that may help to dampen any downside given that they are relatively stable, I think (along with pretty much everyone else) that upside is the most likely scenario here for the industry in the long run. I think the inclusion of these two guys will be a drag on gains.  Also now that I think about it (and I have not researched this), how do they treat dividends from component stocks? SYMC and CSCO each pay a dividend, so how does that get returned to you the investor.  Anyways, a couple thoughts from a long time lurker."

If not, is there a good roadmap to being profitable  4) if it's speculative, do they have low debt with enough cash and/or revenue to keep them afloat until they make money?  5) are they undervalued?"
stocks,3dzc3k,cheznez,6,Tue Jul 21 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people spend time on wondering if the stocks going to jump tomorrow, or next week, or next month. It's a fool's quest. Instead, I try to find awesome companies selling for a good price. Here's how.  1 Do I understand the business? If not, is it simple enough to learn? If not, then Im moving on.  2 Will the company be around in 10 years? This should make you laugh and say yes.   3 Does it have a durable competitive advantage? The most indepth step. I recommend Pat Dorsey's Little Book on the subject.  4 Has it had good growth thats likely to continue? Good growth is at least doubled in the last 10 years. (That's about 7% a year) If not, why? Temporary macrofactors or a permanent shift in consumer preferences?  5 Are the marigins holding steady? Declining margins arent cool.  6 A reasonable amount of debt? As a quick rule of thumb, I want net income to be at least a fifth of the total debt. You should look into the annual report to find what kind of interest rate theyre paying on debt.  7 Are the number of shares holding steady or declining? Exploding shares is a terrible sign.  8 Cash from operations increasing? You want companies that are making lots of cash from ops. Cash from investments and financing should be negative. In other words, youd rather a company is putting money into investments and paying off debt, than selling off assets and taking on debt. All else being equal.  9 Whats the dividend payout ratio? Over 50-60% is likely unsustainable.   10 Is it a good price? I basically cheat here. I focus on finding companies that are awesome and are going to be awesome for a long time. Theres not too many of them. So I dont get too caught up in price if it's in a reasonable range like 15-16 PE when the market is trading at 20 PE."

Earlier today, EBAY became EBAY ($24 per share) and PYPL ($42 per share).  Before the split, let's say Adam bought 5 shares of EBAY for $330 (5 x $66). After the split, he now has 10 shares: 5 EBAY (5 x $24 = $120) + 5 PYPL (5 x $42 = $240) for a total of $330 ($120 + $240).  Let's say Zack also bought 5 shares of EBAY for $330 (also 5 x $66). He now also has $120 in 5 shares of EBAY (5 x $24). His broker is a bit less fancy so they don't have systems in place to handle the split, so they're moving things manually. Zack can probably e-mail them to expedite the process, but ultimately his 5 shares in PYPL (5 x $42) should arrive eventually and he'll have his $330 ($120 in EBAY + $210 in PYPL) in shares."

Look at the current bars and write down in an excel sheet whether you would buy right now. Then move forward in time 1 bar at a time until you reach a point where you would have sold. Do this a couple hundred times. If you're not profitable, go through the trades and see where you went wrong. Did you sell too early? Did you get in too late? If you are profitable, do this same thing with a stock who's price has dropped overall for the past few years. If you're still profitable, great! Use this strategy and start trading."

stocks,3dxjww,skimmer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"Mostly because OTC stocks are typically newbie companies without great revenues.  If you have a company with revenue, you don't need to use shareholder value to pay for everything. Reverse splits are effectively reset buttons for companies to secure the value that's been invested whilst creating epic new price bottoms. In this fashion, you can literally lose 99% of invested value. I think i have one that hit 92% loss or something absurd :p"

Their real business, and the core of their growth, is merchant processing, particularly in the mobile space. Here, Paypal has competitive advantages through its scale and other programs (Bill me later is even more popular with business customers than consumers) that other merchant processors can't touch.   They are able to offer same day processing of payments to their business clients, including on Amex payments. Their merchant fees are difficult if not impossible for other merchant processors to match (pay no attention to their advertised rates... that's only offered to startups and small businesses). And their integration and checkout technology is better by far than anything else out there (see https://www.braintreepayments.com... they handle Uber's payments, along with many others).  Their brand name is built on their P2P and consumer payments systems. Their real business though is in taking a piece of every credit card transaction regardless of whether it says 'Paypal' on the site or not, and in this they are better by far than anyone else.   TL;DR Paypal is well into the process of doing to the merchant processing industry what Netflix is doing to cable."

Salman argues that because there is no evidence that Maher received any such tangible benefit in exchange for the inside information, or that Salman knew of any such benefit, the Government failed to carry its burden. To the extent Newman can be read to go so far, we decline to follow it….  If Salman’s theory were accepted and this evidence found to be insufficient, then a corporate insider or other person in possession of confidential and proprietary information would be free to disclose that information to her relatives, and they would be free to trade on it, provided only that she asked for no tangible compensation in return. Proof that the insider disclosed material nonpublic information with the intent to benefit a trading relative or friend is sufficient to establish the breach of fiduciary duty element of insider trading"

We have a similar one by our house (Can't think of the name), but people are going crazy over that. We also see a Papa Murphys by our house. Always dead.  The reason why pizza tastes so good when you're not cooking it at your house is because of the ""oven"". THey cook it on a conveyor belt at a very high temperature which gives that cheese the burnt but perfectly melted condition. You don't get that with an oven at home. Unless you are ballin out and have a brick oven at home.  Have you ever had Costco pizza before? It's like $6.99 or $7.99 and AMAZING. IT's huge too. I live in Austin, TX and in our freezer section at HEB there are a ton of really new local frozen pizzas that are almost like a craft beer sort of label vibe to it.

While there are many cheaper platforms for cost per trade, I chose E*trade ($9.99 per trade). Quite high but as someone who never traded (or let's call it investing, because I don't plan on doing much day trading to start out with), they have a great educational platform to increase your knowledge. While the Internet will give you all the information you need to learn, I felt better about having all the information in one place laid out for me.   Also, while the accuracy is always questionable, they have multiple reports (Thomson Reuters, Credit Suisse etc) , analysis, and other information which helps give you an indication of what's been happening with the stock, and what some key analysts are saying (I know they don't have a crystal ball but as a beginner, they definitely know more than me)   I think you can save money by going to platforms like Robinhood or OptionsHouse but as a beginner I felt education was more important than outcome in the beginning.   It all depends on what makes you feel comfortable. With platforms that have higher trade value like E*trade, I keep my cost of commission down to 2 percent per share at the highest (so I personal wouldn't conduct a transaction with etrade for less than $400)   Honestly this last week has been an awesome experience that will keep me going into the future.

stocks,3dswz1,cocohobbs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:53:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, just think about it. How much is Ford's inventory worth? Well they havent sold it yet so they have to estimate. Or what is IBM's account receivable worth? Well by definition they havent been paid yet, so that's an estimate too. Then look at property, plant, and equipment. Property is listed at whatever price the company paid for it. In many cases that'll make it an underestimate, because property values tend to rise over the long term. Plant and equipment are listed at what they were paid for, minus depreciation. If the plant and equipment are of little use to other companies, or if theyre out of date, then their actual value can be much lower. And depreciation itself is an estimatation tool. (Im not suggesting I have a better one.)  Goodwill is a great example of how fictitious balance sheet numbers can be. Goodwill is simply the cost of an acquisition minus the acquisition's book value. So goodwill is the result of two fictious numbers. Acquisition cost and book value. For a bad company, goodwill can get written down. Like the AOL Time Warner merger. But for a good company, goodwill can never get written up. Like Berkshire Hathaway buying See's Candies.  Liabilties are a lot more concrete than assets. Accounts payable for example, is a real expense. Youre going to have to pay all of it. Same with your long term debt. It's fairly easy to just add up what you owe, because it's in dollars. Where as assets can be in nonliquid goods, liabilities are in dollars. Just remember, that not all debt is equal. Apple's long term debt is at a much lower interest rate than GameStop's, for example. I think of that interest rate as a company's cost of capital.  Where you can get into trouble is things like pensions. In the late 90's, companies were estimating that their pension funds would continue to rise at 16%. You dont need me to tell you that this wasnt the case. So what happened is a lot of companies had drastically unfunded their pensions and that money had to come from somewhere. (Hell, with the airlines they just went bankrupt and the money came from Uncle Sam.)  All this information can be found in the annual report."
stocks,3dswz1,Dynamito,2,Sun Jul 19 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Just want to point out that Goodwill is actually the difference between the acquisition cost and FAIR VALUE (not book value) of the balance sheet.  When you have an acquisition it is considered a significant business event and the company will write up all their assets to fair value (like you mentioned with land or obsolete equipment).  After that, if the company is still being purchased for more than the identifiable net assets (Assets - Liabilities) then there is an adjustment for goodwill.    So really, Goodwill is based off of 0 ""fictitious numbers"" at time of the acquisition because everything is valued at fair value as of the date of the acquisition.    Also as far as assets being made up, AR is usually verified by the auditors and if there are accounts or balances that look like they will be hard to be collected, then management must place a reserve against these accounts effectively taking their amount off the balance sheet so really A/R is pretty reliable unless they have a very large portion with one customer who goes bankrupt.    Source: CPA/Auditor"
stocks,3dswz1,Dynamito,2,Sun Jul 19 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for correcting me on the fair value vs book value. I wrote this up while I was still lying in bed and I must have had a cobweb over tbe part of my brain that knew that. I would still argue that the acquisition cost is a fictious number. Just because someone paid that much for an asset, doesnt make the asset worth that much. Especially as time goes on. And as for the fair value, even that can be argued to be fictious in a limited sense. A realtor estimate of property is still an estimate, although perhaps a very reasonable one. Fiction is likely too strong a word tho.  As for A/R, I understand that companies account for not all receivables being paid. That too, is an estimate. The point of my post was not to say that balance sheet numbers are completely pointless. Far from it. My point was merely that there a little stories behind each number, and it's up to the investor to figure out if that story is believable or not."
stocks,3dswz1,Dynamito,2,Sun Jul 19 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct that as time goes on the fair value will change and goodwill might not be worth the same as on the date of acquisition. They are only required to check the value of their Goodwill when there is a chance it could be impaired so they aren't going to revalue it every year up and down 5%.    Also, I know what you're trying to say as far as fair value being an estimate... but some would argue that if Amazon is willing to pay $1 billion for twitch.tv... then that is fair market value.  Because as long as it's purchased on the fair market... that's the value.  It's your right as an investor to disagree and think that maybe they are overvaluing the acquisition but there's no real way to find a ""better"" figure on things like that.    For things like real estate... a 3rd party appraisal is about as good as you're going to get.  Market prices and 3rd party are ideal... after that it goes to other valuation methods that may be less accurate.  (level 2)... or finally to management estimates (level 3) which are still audited by their accounting firm.    At the end of the day, you are correct.  There are lots of estimates in the balance sheet.  But that's not a bad thing.  As long as their auditors say that management is being reasonable... no problem!  In many cases there is no way to get a 100% accurate number without a fortune teller. :)"
stocks,3dswz1,Dynamito,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:27 2015 UTC,"This is actually not something that UNP is doing wrong.    In FASB ASC: 450-20-30-1,   when both of those recognition criteria are met, and the reasonably estimable loss is a range, it requires accrual of the amount that appears to be a better estimate than any other estimate within the range, or accrual of the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  This is what GAAP says the company must accrue and disclose if there is no reasonable estimate within the range."

Just look at the stock chart for the 2008 crash or any other crash in history and it always comes back to even greater heights so this will too. Plus, the big oil companies in OPEC have had a taste of high price oil and are only temporarily keeping prices low to hurt other countries, but green never fails and they will drive the prices right back up after they finish slowly buying up oil stocks at these incredible lows. It would be a huge mistake to sell low, especially if you have 50% + losses. You should actually be doubling up on your positions right now. I would suggest buying as many Crescent Point Energy shares as you can as their dividend is 12.3% and pretty much guaranteed, so even if the price bounces around a bit, you're still collecting dividends every month. The general market itself is at pretty much all time highs, so would be stupid to buy more stock now - just wait for a big crash and buy when it's all ""doom and gloom"".

stocks,3dqznf,jigga_wigga_myNigga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:54 2015 UTC,New here as well but it seems that the low price stems from all the uncertainty in the multitude of variables that affect oil. Last year at this time $GDP was in the $15-$20 range but as the dollar has become strong again commodities drop. Look at how gold dropped as well. $50/barrel for oil is low but people think it can go lower. Plus if the Iran sanctions drop there could be a large amount of oil available to world markets. People already talk about how oil companies are looking for storage because of the excess amount of oil they have on hand. This makes people worry about too much supply and prices dropping.   You just have to decide if you're willing to hold for a long time for things to swing the other way. Once we get a bear market and the dollar comes down commodities may rise again and with that comes rising energy stocks.  But who knows how long that could take. And who knows if $GDP will be around when it takes off. They have their 2Q earnings conference call on August 5. It's likely that the price will drop even more before that date.

I was just stating (with very bad wording) if you have things you need to spend money on do that first (paying bills/eating). If you can only save $200/mo just deposit it into the account and keep it cash until you have $1000 to dump into a stock just like you said.

TFSAs are not part of the tax treaty with the US and any dividends get 30% withheld. Also, do a one time conversion from CDN to USD and then trade out of the US side of your brokerage account. This way you only get hit with conversion fees once, if you trade out of the CDN side you'll get hit with conversion fees on the buy and sell. Now as far as the CDN $ value goes it looks like it's going to be low for a while due to oil being low and likely to go lower with the Iran deal being completed. CDN economy is impacted by oil price. I think you can buy USD now and invest in US equities and not have to worry too much about the CDN $ rising thereby impacting your gains.

stocks,3do840,dukestar,2,Sat Jul 18 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Canadian dollar has further to fall....  The Bank of Canada has put themselves in a bit of an awkward situation. The Canadian housing market is still overheated and the economy is slowing down. The BOC made the mistake of not raising rates fast enough, nor high enough following the 2008 crash. They've consequently fuelled the housing market to even higher levels of insanity.  The BOC has now been forced to lower rates given the slower economy, while at the same time the FED is talking about rising rates. If the US raises rates, I think this will put further pressure on the $CAD, while it is already under pressure from a heated housing market, slowing economy, low commodity prices and a collapsing China. Also, if the economy continues to slow, the BOC doesn't have much room to lower rates, as they failed to raise them since the 2008 rate drops.  Personally, I've had my money in USD since the last time we were 1:1. I don't see the $CAD getting back to 1:1 for a long time.

A lot of em index funds still have large holdings in things like petrobras and vale, which are down significantly.  A broad em index may start doing well again tomorrow, but again I feel like active management has done better lately.  I do like the Asian conglomerates - ck Hutchison (ckhuy) and jardine matheson (jmhly). Ck Hutchison just had a nearly $9 special dividend the other week so it's significantly cheaper for someone buying now. (From around $23 to $14.) Both are risky but have significant long-term track records and compelling assets.   Ck Hutchison is one of the largest port operators in the world, has a significant infrastructure investment arm and owns as Watson, one of the largest health and beauty retailers in Asia and Europe, as well as a lot else. Jardine in the majority owner of Mandarin Oriental hotels as well as a giant retail conglomerate called dairy farm and many other things. Jardine is kind of an Asian Berkshire and has been around since the 1800's.  There is also a new super dividend etf for em (sdem) which may do a tad better than the etfs you mentioned. At the very least that does have a higher dividend and monthly payout."

stocks,3dm7p9,thegil13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Yea ditto. With VFX industry its got great market share. And in the Architecture/Construction industry their market share is rapidly growing (BIM software) which is basically forcing companies to buy multiple products if you have any one of them. The problem is they are completely overpriced products and their move to the cloud, while at first look is great, is unfortunately not going to gain a lot of small business/students/others. The fact that this company refuses to offer very capable (non-student but not-full) versions for a very small minimal fee is ridiculous. I would have easily bought the student pack of AI, PS, ID, AutoCAD, Revit, etc., for $5-20 a month. The company needs to learn that they can capture a small amount of the people that bootleg these products and get them under their wing they could possibly make money on it. But even if they dont, the payoff comes in the future. The problem right now is you get frustrated dealing with Revit crashes and such since you can't get updates since its an illegal version. Eventually you are going to start looking at other options like the vastly growing SketchUp (which has a GREAT free version). They need to learn that if you can ""hook"" the person when they are in school/young, they will have them for life. Very few people in school or out of school will learn a program for 3 years then try to learn a new one out of school as they are entering the workplace."

However, while it was initially just TechCrunch (which is coincidentally owned by AOL), other publications have stated that their sources circle around the same rumor. Only time will tell.   I won't give any recommendations either way, but I think the most undervalued asset of MM is its SDK footprint. SDKs are what makes mobile ad networks unique to desktop ad networks or video ad networks. When an app wants to bring in ads into its app it had to download and code into its app an SDK (software development kit). This is not easy to rip out and it's tough to convince an app to bring in a new one. MM was an early mover in the space and has built out a big SDK footprint of 65K apps. There aren't many independent assets left with as big of an SDK footprint like MMs. Add to that the Nexage asset MM just bought and you have a pretty unique mobile asset."

stocks,3dirzh,ThaFuck,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:23 2015 UTC,One consideration to add however is the stock split. NFLX was immediately more affordable to more investors on the day of the news compared to just last week.  I doubt we would have seen such a response to the financials if unit price was $700. The split was cleverly timed.  This of course might mean a considerable sell off is incoming. A glut of buyers and recently enriched holders might tempt a larger than normal group to cashing in as the hype plateaus.

stocks,3dirzh,TheSwimmingDutchman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"I would worry that it's too over-priced right now. It's trading at 210 price to earnings. In general, 20-30 P/E tends to be held as average to over-priced. There is a lot more room for it to go down than for it to go up. While Netflix is a fantastic long term buy, I don't think it's a good buy at the current prices."
stocks,3dirzh,HughesDePayens,2,Fri Jul 17 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but on the other hand their subscription rates are ever increasing and at any moment they could increase the monthly fee even a dollar or two with very little backlash from their clients, but at an ENORMOUS profit.    They won't do it just yet, probably, because they're still seeing rapid growth in subscription rates, but sooner or later they will.  Also, if they ever get a licensing deal with HBO, they will win at everything. It may never happen, but chances are it will eventually if you ask me.  And lastly, the only way they would die is if they saw some strong competition from elsewhere, which I also don't really see happening unless some other major company takes a real shot at it.    Steam has seen competitors come and go, and entire publishers (EA) have tried to compete with their digital distribution service, and yet they have failed. I think the fate will be the same for anyone who wants to compete with Netflix in this domain.  Amazon is the only company who has a shot, but they've got a long way to go.  All this being said, I don't own netflix, but that may change. I'm keeping a close eye on it."
stocks,3dirzh,HughesDePayens,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"I guess that does sort of depend on how you see the market. Personally, I like to trade on fundamentals - which, you're right, aren't NFLX's strong point. That's why I hadn't bought yet.  I'm in agreement there.  You're also right that there are a lot of what ifs, though they always seem to become more certain as time goes on.  NFLX is an interesting company no matter how you look at it. I think one thing we can definitely both agree on is the fact that nobody should outright ignore them."

Bpy and bx are mlps so k1s at tax time.  Danaher (dhr) is a very compelling company that is up 18000% since inception and its something that you never hear about. Will it have that kind of performance going forward? Who knows but it is still a highly compelling company with great elements in place and will split probably next year into two companies.  http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2007-02-18/a-dynamo-called-danaher  Danaher is famously media shy but the above is one of the few major articles.  Brookfield property (bpy) is a world class collection of real estate trading under book value. Bpy is an mlp though so you get a k1 at tax time. Parent company Brookfield asset (bam) is also a great co but not undervalued as I think bpy is. There is also mlp Brookfield infrastructure (bip) which is a terrific collection of global infrastructure assets (ports, toll roads and much more.) Bip and bpy are flexible and opportunistic and their holdings will likely change over the short and long term.  Jardine matheson (jmhly) is an Asian conglomerate that has been around for well over 100 years and is sort of the Asian Berkshire Hathaway.  Ecolab (ecl) is the largest hygiene and sanitation company. It's a play on a lot of different things but a highlight right now is their water division with what is going on in California. But otherwise here is an incredibly consistent company that has raised divs for 30+ years. Bill gates is a very large shareholder.  Visa and Mastercard are taking share from amex (which is not a bad company but they have admittedly lost share.) Apple pay - what card are you using? Who is processing? Not apple. More use of mobile wallets = more v/ma. How many people used their v or ma in the time I wrote this and they got a % of those transactions.  CVS is taking over target pharmacy operations. That's a quick 1600 or so locations without having to build anything.  Again just going through some examples."

That said, Costco was a significant part of their business. They can say that it didn't make fiscal sense for them and whether or not that's true or Costco wanted to go a different way and attract a larger base of cardholders I don't know. Any which way though, it was a loss to visa.   Additionally, after Costco Canada went to MasterCard, I figured it was probably a matter of time before the us Costco went to v or ma. Amex also lost JetBlue shortly after and the ruling recently against stopping store owners from suggesting customers use other cards (although I don't see that being a huge thing.)  Heard from someone with a Costco amex that they were sent a letter with other amex card options. If I were amex I'd offer a little something if a Costco amex cardholder signed up for a different card.  I do think the lack of credit risk for v and ma is increasingly appealing to investors, as well.  Are v and ma taking a lot of amex market share? No, but they've taken some and its up to amex to keep share from eroding further.   I like fis quite a bit and plan to hold that longer term. Not a fan of their exposure to currentc (which I don't think will ever get going) but otherwise an exemplary business and a category that is dominated by fis and fisv. Fis is rarely ever talked about but its a very neat company and was recently selected to be on the steering committee for the Fed's discussed new money transfer network."

It keeps going up after you sell. Don't worry about it, you took your profit at the time you thought was right. Second guessing yourself too much after the fact might make you too greedy on the next stock and cause you to not know when to sell"
stocks,3dhkzd,jsmithftw,3,Thu Jul 16 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you take your money out of a company, do so for a good reason, like another company being more interesting.  If you're taking your money out for it to just sit there, then you're wasting valuable time you could have continued to be in the market.  The only real reason to take money out of a company you believe in wholeheatedly without a plan as to what you're going to do with that money is if you either need the liquid cash or if you have very solid evidence pointing towards a decline in value for that company.  If you're wrong in your reasoning for taking your money out and it does continue to go up, don't feel bad about that. You got paid, you got money, and now you're getting more money somewhere else. You did the right thing - or maybe you didn't - but if you second guess every move you make, you're fucked."

stocks,3dhkzd,WallStreetWatkins,3,Sat Jul 18 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"From my years of watching TV and stocks during the day I've learned that whenever a stock hits a 52-week or all-time high it typically goes right back down 5-10%. This is likely from those hedge fund managers who use supercomputers to analyze data and take profits. Of course this doesn't apply when the stock has a catalyst: Earnings Reports, Beating Top/Bottom Line, Increasing Forecast, Upgrades of Price Targets, etc. No one ever got hurt taking a profit.  My second piece of advice would be don't hold onto a stock if you take a loss hoping that it will go back up. Stocks don't go back up on hopes. Cut your loses and move on to the next stock you feel good about based on the information available and it's fundamentals: P/E ratio, health of their sector, CEO management, etc. In 2013 I held onto Ford (F) because I took a loss and didn't want to sell until it went back up. During that time the stock was stagnant for about 6 months and if I would have just sold and cut my loses at that time I could have boughten X shares of TSLA or NFLX or CMG or AAPL, all of  which I was watching and wanted to buy, but had no cash on hand at the time since they were all tied up. Instead of taking the lose and reinvesting into a stock with better fundamentals and catalysts I made 0% vs. the extraordinary gains I could have made had I put them into any of the above. Obviously, selling $F didn't guarantee me that NFLX, TSLA, CMG, or AAPL would go up, but I've been kicking myself for not learning this lesson sooner.  In a more recent example I'm currently holding: AAPL, FB, GILD, JBLU. All of which have done well YoY, however, I REALLY wanted to sell something to buy NFLX ahead of yesterday's earnings, but didn't because the above 4 stocks are all AT or NEAR 52-week or All-Time highs. The result? I gained 1-2% from the 4 above stocks and NFLX killed their numbers and conference call and is up 15% today. Always go with your gut cause you'll be more pissed you didn't make the move if it goes up than you will if you don't make the move and it goes down."

stocks,3dhkzd,PowerSystemsGuy,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is the MOST common mistake, but it's a biggie when it happens early on:  You buy a stock (""enter into a position"", but let's keep it simple) because you like the company or have done a little research, whatever.  It goes up a lot, then you get excited and sell.  You are now the most dangerous person in the world to your trading account, because you think you're good at this.  You didn't ""plan the trade and trade the plan."" You winged it (or had rules and broke them) and got lucky, and you think it means something.  Object Lesson:  I bought 25,000 shares of AIG with a cost basis of $0.23 the Monday after that hellish weekend back in '08.  My thinking was ""there's no WAY they're going to let it fold.  It's too integral to the macroeconomic landscape.""  And... that part was right.    I sold it after hours on Thursday night for $4.15 a share because I couldn't take the pressure of watching it like a hawk any more.  I didn't sell it because I charted ""between $4 and $4.25"" as an upside exit.  I gambled and happened to win.  It was a DISASTER.  Yeah. I had a near 20 bagger.  But I thought that trade made me the hottest shit since sliced bread.  I made bad decision after bad decision after bad decision.  I traded on hunches.    Those profits were gone by the end of the year.  Did I learn my lesson?  I think so.  But then...we always think so.  Plan. The. Trade.  When am I getting in.  WHY am I getting in.  What price and conditions are going to cause me to sell and take my profit?  What price and conditions are going to cause me to sell and take as much of a loss as I'm willing to bear?   Then trade. that. plan.  If you make money on a trade and you didn't trade according to your plan, the trade was NOT a success.  If you lose money but were out according to your rules, the trade WAS a success.  You were just wrong about the idea.  The two have nothing to do with each other.  Otherwise you're in fantasy land.

stocks,3dhtnp,Moertel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:10 2015 UTC,"However, is there no gains to be had at all within the next year or so?    Sure there are. Nobody can predict the market.   If you think the company has a viable business and a decent outlook, it's pretty much always worth an investment (I'm invested in DIS too). Just don't base your investment decisions on a single, well-known factor and then expect to outsmart the rest of the market."
stocks,3dhtnp,Sip_py,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  So you saying it's already priced in; does that mean if Star Wars is a way bigger hit than anticipated that the stock won't fluctuate much?  Would you say all the merchandising and other misc profits from stuff like this is already priced in? I'm just trying to wrap my head around ""priced in""."
stocks,3dhtnp,AllanBz,3,Thu Jul 16 12:44:36 2015 UTC,"If it is a bigger hit than anticipated, it'll certainly help to improve earnings and yes, that should increase the stock price. Please note that expectations are already massive though.  All potential profits are already priced in, based purely on expectations. The market won't suddenly spring at DIS simply because Star Wars is released - it'll have to do better than expected to have a favorable effect."
stocks,3dhtnp,manaburner,2,Thu Jul 16 12:55:53 2015 UTC,Studios are seeing massive turn outs for franchises with existing fan bases. Jurassic World doing 400 in the first two weekends I expect Star Wars to do 500 million first two weekends. I see a huge jump if they exceed that.
stocks,3dhtnp,Sip_py,3,Thu Jul 16 13:22:03 2015 UTC,"It means that if the movie disappoints, people will have to revise their estimates downwards from the current price. The upside has been priced in but not the downside.  But!  Remember that Disney Studios only accounts for an eighth or so of the stock's profits. If the movie does well, it will feed into future movies in the franchise (the same eighth), and tie-ins to toys, products, and interactive media (one sixth). While Disney is great at converting their media properties into product sales, the Star Wars franchise does not have the universal appeal of something like Frozen, which appeals to families and girls as well as teenaged boys.  The biggest portion of Disney is ESPN (smidge under one third), which the movie franchise won't move at all. Another segment is television—but no one will subscribe to the Disney Channel or sell ads on ABC because of Star Wars (about a seventh together).  You may perhaps get an incremental increase because of new Star Wars rides and live shows goosing attendance at the parks and resorts (one quarter) next year. The parks/resort segment probably won't be affected by a huge hit so much as by the cost of the fuel required to get people into the parks.  Altogether, you're only increasing one third of the company's revenue base (assuming the Skywalkers don't use their Jedi mind tricks to make everyone in the theaters go to the theme parks right away).  I may be missing something, but you're betting on a very small portion of the business to increase what may be an already fairly-priced stock."
stocks,3dhtnp,mrenglish22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"A good example of ""Priced In"" is if the new Start Wars movie was a hit and Disney made millions, market will expect the earnings to be high so they buy the stock even before the earnings release."
stocks,3dhtnp,ohreallybro,6,Thu Jul 16 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"I'm happy I got in at $88 but I've also been dollar cost averaging in since then. I don't see them going down much. On the worst days the only ever move 1%. I think it's because they're so widely held - its not all mutual funds and pensions but a shit load of individual investors (why they only use to pay an annual dividend, record keeping was a bitch).  To answer your question, I think now is as good of a time as any. Not only do they have Starwars in the pipeline, but frozen 2, toy story 4, 10 marvel movies, not to mention the live action remakes and the randos that surprise everyone (big hero 6 and the new one with emotions) and the synergy to profit off these brands across retail and theme parks. I also have a premonition they will consider buying Netflix if they face headwinds from debungling.  I believe they will be at 200-300 in the next 5-7 years. Also seeing as they are in the Dow, they could eye a split if they hit the $200 range."

stocks,3dhtnp,aspiringanalyst,2,Fri Jul 17 03:30:53 2015 UTC,It's tempting to put most my eggs in this DIS basket! I think because I just really like the company. Everyone tells me to be diversified though so I'm going with 70% in 3 index funds and 30% in Disney until I learn more about what I'm doing or find more companies that I like.  Anyone have any feedback on this? Bad/Good idea?  I have this shroud of doubt hanging over my head.  I just need a place to stick a lot of money over the long term while I learn more. Eventually I'd like to balance my portfolio to mostly stocks instead of index funds... as I get smarter and more confident.
stocks,3dhtnp,CouragePope,2,Thu Jul 16 14:26:57 2015 UTC,"The biggest catalysts for the stock (good or bad) for the next year are going to be:   Cord-cutting -- Media is a very sizeable portion of DIS's revenue; ABC is most at risk here with content that can be replaced and doesn't need to be watched live; even ESPN is at risk (they just announced cuts and contract rates going up) Star Wars (and movie line-up) -- most analysts are predicting this to be a record breaking box-office event, if this isn't stellar, investors will be disappointed. This also extends to the rest of their movie line-up, which looks pretty damn awesome (capitalizing on the superhero trend and revitalizing IP with live action remakes -- Tarzan, Mulan, etc). Pixar also had 2 movies this year (Inside Out and Good Dinosaur), where none last year Disneyland Shanghai -- they just announced additional details yesterday and it looks pretty good... however, again there's a lot riding on this (no pun intended) Shanghai is expected to be 20%+ of future amusement park receipts (DIS only owns ~50%, Shanghai city owns the rest). With the recent stock market issues hitting middle class China hardest, there is some concern re: park attendance but it shouldn't be huge  Restructuring of consumer products / interactive -- on the whole, physical toys are being replaced by digital, so if DIS isn't able to monetize their franchises in the future via digital, this may prove to be a bigger issue; furthermore, they just consolidated their consumer products and interactive divisions, there is likely to be some tension there   Short-term news to look out for are:   Earnings on 8/4 -- IMHO they killed it this quarter with NBA finals being most watched, Disneyland anniversary, Inside Out being a sleeper hit  Any updates on Box Office receipts (e.g. Inside Out) Any updates on TV advertising for major sporting events (Wimbledon, Masters...) D23 event on 8/14-16 -- they usually announce a few new movies now and then"
