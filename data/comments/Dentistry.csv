Dentistry,3e6sr3,agirlandhergame,2,Wed Jul 22 11:55:03 2015 UTC,"You can always get a second opinion for free at another general dentist.  Bring that x-day and make it clear it's just a consult and request they discuss any payment before performing work.  If you do need a root canal this other dentist might get you the antibiotics that could potentially ease your pain. Also, if you do end up needing a root canal talk to the old dentist about redoing the crown.  If it's seated permanently then they have to drill through it which will leave a small hole that is typically covered with a regular filling.  This lessens the strength of a crown that you just dropped over a grand on.  MAKE THEM REDO IT FOR FREE. Is that X-ray with the permanent or temporary crown?"
Dentistry,3e6sr3,pleasefloss,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:02:31 2015 UTC,This is just the temporary placed on Thursday. Can they do the root canal through the temp? Or does it have to come off? Will my regular dentist be willing to place permanent crown on after an endodontist does the root canal (finish the job even though someone else has been playing around in my mouth)? Ive already decided if I need a root canal I'm getting an endo (or just someone else) to do it.
Dentistry,3e6sr3,pleasefloss,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:11:07 2015 UTC,"P.S.  This really sucks it's happening right before a big trip, otherwise I would suggest having them adjust it more and waiting.  Without hot and cold sensitivity it might just be the bite still.  When you do go in to whomever request a cold test.  An irritated nerve that needs a root canal will have extreme pain with cold that lingers for about 20-40 seconds.  As far as money, with out insurance those prices seem about right. Where do you live, if you don't mind?"

Dentistry,3e4sqs,powderitis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:36:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply, I greatly appreciate your feedback. I suppose I wasn't clear, but I have already had a root canal on this exact tooth. Is that common? If the pain subsides, that indicates that the infection could be going away, but a procedure in that case would still be necessary, is that correct? Thanks again, I just wish I could get to the dentist faster.."
Dentistry,3e4sqs,dwarvendaycare,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"Infection could go away on it's own but it is rather unlikely. More often it will stay there, become chronic and will cause you trouble when you're on your way to your vacation. In general it is advised to deal with such problems. There is something wrong with a tooth that hurts so much it keeps you awake even if it is root canaled. Check with your dentist, he should do a Xray."

Dentistry,3e4sqs,dwarvendaycare,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"You can't say. It is not advised to keep that kind of a situation around for three more weeks since these kind of diseases tend to produce more severe complications (abscess ect.). If you can control the pain with painkillers it could be okay as long as there is no swelling present or you're getting a fever. Again, with unbearable toothpain it is generally advised to see a dentist asap."

Dentistry,3e4ysd,RootCanalThrowaway12,3,Wed Jul 22 00:12:57 2015 UTC,The lump above your gums was most likely an abscess. Abscess = dead tooth and dead teeth need root canals. Did they take an xray? Put something cold on the teeth?
Dentistry,3e4ysd,prophywife,3,Wed Jul 22 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"They didn't take an xray after finding it. Also, my teeth aren't sensitive to heat/cold at all. They feel just the same at all my other teeth."
Dentistry,3e4ysd,prophywife,5,Wed Jul 22 02:11:13 2015 UTC,You should ask the dentist to explain how they know the tooth needs a root canal. You probably do need them given your history of probable abscess but there are some very obvious clinical signs that a root canal is necessary. I wouldn't expect the tooth to be sensitive; you shouldn't feel anything on those teeth because they are dead. That's why I asked if they put something cold on it.

Dentistry,3e38xx,ToothJanitor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely wait until your gums are not inflamed. I would wait a few days.   The whitening gel is irritating to gums. While custom trays reduce the amount of gel that touches the gums, the less the better.   Practice putting in and taking out the trays w/o the gel. Use just a little gel on the front side of the teeth. The gel will spread when you put the trays in. Do one arch, put the tray in and see how it is before putting the gel in the second tray.   Some people develop tooth sensitivity from the gel. So wait a day between treatments to see how it goes."

Dentistry,3e15rz,deucedeuce24,5,Tue Jul 21 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"There are different tiers of programs that excel overall and in specific departments. There are still exceptional students from every school but I think, in general, the higher tier schools produce better dentists. But there is also a large quality difference even within a school, so the school is not necessarily indicative of a dentist's skill. My class had a lot of skilled clinicians with strong academic backgrounds as well as a few that I certainly wouldn't trust with my teeth. Ultimately, it's up to you how much effort you're willing to put in to your education which I think is the most predictable factor for success.  As far as choosing a program, it's a very personal choice. You have to decide what is important to you (cost, location, reputation, etc.) and look at schools accordingly. Good luck and hope you get some choices!"

Dentistry,3e15rz,cementicIes,4,Tue Jul 21 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"The curriculum is standardized so all the schools should be teaching the same procedures. Questions you may want to ask for details about a program you probably can't find online are board passing rates, percentage of students who specialize, how clinic chairs are used (if you get your own chair, share one, or if it's a free-for-all), and research/community service opportunities."

I would say that if you are a son/daughter of a dentist and attend your parent's alma mater, you will likely be treated better than a first generation dentist.  Especially if your parent is a donor..."
Dentistry,3e15rz,dirkdirkdirk,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:38 2015 UTC,Go to one in the same geographical region at least to where you want to live. Huge reason is regional boards and live patient selection is easier if you're able to take the exam at your school with your patients. In state hopefully (if that works for you) is best because it's cheapest. Schools in larger urban areas are better for clinicals because you will see more patients and pathology.
Dentistry,3e15rz,TheGogglesD0Nothing,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"The American Dental Association governs the dental curriculum of all dental schools in the USA so all dental schools should be equal in what is taught to their students.

Dentistry,3e15rz,DrDoom_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:20 2015 UTC,"All schools have the same curriculum yes, but not all schools have decent professors who can actually teach and know what the words coming out their mouth mean. I've had a handful of professors that were just absolutely atrocious at teaching and made me wonder how they were still teaching at my school, given the fact that each year they get shitty student evaluations. Then you have those lazy-ass professors who don't give a shit about the students and are only there because they were some big shot in their field. So they just end up reading off the words/definitions in their slides for 2-3 hours. Then you have those professors who either have a stutter, mumble, thick accent, or can't even speak english. But yea, same curriculum.   OP if you wanted to be very picky with your schools, focus your questions on how clinics run and how the students like their professors. Ask the students during the interview if they had shitty professors. You will see the excitement light up in their eyes when given the opportunity to bad mouth a shit professor. Ask about if they have international professors/diversity in the teaching body. Honestly I'd rather have an excellent difficult teacher, than a shitty easy professor."
Dentistry,3e2cav,MLaidman,4,Tue Jul 21 12:31:59 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of the stuff on this sub it's hard to give a definitive answer unless we see the actual X-ray. Considering you were around 18 when the x-ray was taken, it's likely that he saw the angulation of the third molars and had a pretty good idea how they are coming out. It's reasonable that by the age of 18, both the root and crown have already formed.  Dentists spend a decent amount of time learning about tooth development and eruption so it would make sense the oral surgeon would be able to predict this. We can get a pretty good ballpark estimate of a child's age from what teeth are in their mouths.  Usually when you take out wisdom teeth, you just take out all of them while you're there. They are pretty much nonfunctional and hard to clean. If he takes out on the bottom, the top set will just keep erupting until they hit opposing teeth (which aren't there). And with no opposing teeth, they serve no purpose and will probably come out in the future anyways."
Dentistry,3e2cav,helloclams,3,Tue Jul 21 12:43:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I wasn't trying to say that dentists and surgeons aren't good at what they do, they definitely are.  I just went in there with the expectation of getting an x-ray - which my dentist said they needed to take - and when I got there this surgeon was very quick to just flat out insist that they needed to take them out, and when I asked about the old x-rays he just sort of went  ""Oh, yeah... I guess we don't need to take them.""  Thanks for your reply, I know it's hard to actually say anything without seeing the x-ray..."
Dentistry,3e2cav,helloclams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"He's probably insistent on getting them taken out because it's the most common thing done with third molars. They really aren't that necessary and more of a pain for the average person. Also considering that these third molars don't sound completely impacted, it probably will be a relatively easy, low risk extraction so he's probably not too concerned.  If you are done growing and the teeth are done growing he might glean as much as he could from that x-ray. I know the range is 2-5 years for a panoramic x-ray depending on the dentist."
Dentistry,3e2cav,doctorwhodds,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe the oral surgeon was expecting there to be a more up to date x-ray, and when one wasn't available had to make his best guess based on 36 month old data.  Very odd that the surgeon wouldn't want a new x-ray, usually they want to most up-to-date information they can have."

The fillings will cost you less right now, but long term they should be crowned costing you more money in the future. The other downside is due to the lost tooth structure those teeth are more likely to fracture in the future resulting in the loss of more tooth structure. However you may have better dental coverage in the future so the cost of the crown could be covered or partially covered.   And you can always put a crown over the filling at a later date."

When you have pockets that deep, it is near impossible for you yourself to clean deep into the sulcus. When the dentist/hygienist cleans deep into the sulcus with instruments or a cavitron, it not only debrides the sulcus of calculus and other debris, it can stimulate your immune system to start repairing the tissue surrounding your tooth. So, long story short, yes it is well worth the money. If you let that progress, it can lead to tooth lose and even worse tissue damage. That's actually a great price for 2 visits and what I'm assuming to be a chlorhexidine rinse. I'm a dental student btw."

Dentistry,3e0etc,toothpainow,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think you are likely to get dry socket, but if you were, that tooth on the bottom would be the spot as more surgery was needed to get it out.   Dry socket causes really bad pain, like 9/10.   You only need the gauze if you are bleeding. Once it has stopped, you don't need it. The wounds may ooze a bit, that is ok.   As for eating, soft food neither very hot or very cold. Cottage cheese is fine. Pasta with butter. PB&J. Not hot tea. No sucking, so nothing through a straw. No smoking.   Put ice packs on outside cheeks. 20 minutes on/ 20 off minimize swelling."

Dentistry,3e128w,everpop,6,Tue Jul 21 03:26:51 2015 UTC,Irreversible pulpitis can have lots of possible causes on a tooth with secondary decay under a filing. Could it be from an improper filing? It's possible. Could it be from the cavity itself? Definitely. I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that the dentist did something wrong based solely on this info.  Keep in mind that complications can also arise from an improperly placed amalgam filling.
Dentistry,3e128w,Mujutsu,2,Tue Jul 21 11:13:00 2015 UTC,After doing a consultation with the endodontist (associated practice with my original dental practice) he's pretty sure the pain is due to a improperly done filling. Improper isolation from moisture?  I just hope now I have a leg to stand on if I ask for a refund or a replacement at the original dental practice.
Dentistry,3e128w,rossdds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:12 2015 UTC,It's hilarious the endodontist said this given what just happened.

Dentistry,3e128w,Mujutsu,2,Tue Jul 21 23:04:55 2015 UTC,I just got into an argument w this board about exactly this.
Dentistry,3e128w,DiamondBurInTheRough,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:03 2015 UTC,If the filling was done incorrectly in the first place then speak to your dentist and he should replace it for free.
Dentistry,3e128w,DiamondBurInTheRough,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:08 2015 UTC,I'm more confused as to why your dentist told you composite is better for molars. I've learned the exact opposite....especially in  large cavities.
Dentistry,3e128w,onlythetooth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did some research before going in about amalgram vs. composites and I thought the same. But when I went in he said for the area, composite would be stronger and would bond better."
Dentistry,3e128w,onlythetooth,0,Tue Jul 21 15:02:25 2015 UTC,Amalgam depends heavily on the retention of the prepared tooth. So when the dentist is removing the decay she/he has to prepare the shape to hold a filling in place a little more than with composite since composite bonds to the tooth. Composite does bond well but it's not stronger.
Dentistry,3e128w,rossdds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:34 2015 UTC,I wish I doubly insisted on amalgams then.... just usually whenever I go to the doctors/dentists I try to trust their opinion over whatever I google beforehand.
Dentistry,3e128w,kyriann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"So, you're saying that, according to the endodontist, your dentist did not isolate the composite correctly so it failed and then was unable to recognize this, sending you to the endodontist instead. Why would you think returning to this dentist to correct this filling will work out?"

Dentistry,3e04y4,DiamondBurInTheRough,3,Mon Jul 20 23:03:06 2015 UTC,To add on to that. You should get a cleaning. There is a lot of build up on all your teeth.

Unless you have special needs like sensitivity, 99% of all over the counter fluoride toothpastes are the same. Buy a flavor you like that is reasonably priced and had fluoride.

I did hear long time ago before fluoride was an issue that toothpaste was only to make the process more palatable and served no other function.  Listerine used to run commercials that a double-blind study established that their mouthwash was nearly as good as flossing. Any truth at all?
Dentistry,3dyblw,da5id1,4,Mon Jul 20 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"Rechargable electrics are a good idea. Yes, for most patients, fluoride is the only point to toothpaste. Listerine is full of bull."

Dentistry,3dyblw,da5id1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:18 2015 UTC,I thought so. I do find though that in the evening rinsing with Colgate something seems to dislodge more debris than water alone. Could be my imagination.

Dentistry,3dxbfn,ToothJanitor,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"For most people the cheapest fluoride paste is the best. Even whitening pastes don't really do much and why pay for sensitivity relief if you are not sensitive, etc. Ditto for manual brushes. A soft 99 cents on sale brush will do just fine. Floss is all abou personal preference. Use whichever one gets you to floss. Places to spend more: get a fluoride rinse instead of a mere freshening one. Save up and buy a rechargable brush.  If you aren't flossing daily, consider investing in floss picks to help you get into the habit. If you have braces or a ton of bridgework a waterpik may be a good idea and proxy brushes are pretty much a must."
Dentistry,3dyf4y,PrettyPersistant,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:28 2015 UTC,Depends on many factors that the orthodontist will explain.
Dentistry,3dyf4y,V3rsed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily ""typical"" but if you need a great deal of space... than I guess I could see the rationale for it. Are you certain they meant 1st molars and not 1st premolars? If you were my patient I would rather leave you in 1st molar occlusion and EXT premolars... but maybe they needed more space than that."
Dentistry,3dyf4y,biteblock,4,Mon Jul 20 18:27:03 2015 UTC,Sometimes they recommend first molars over virgin premolars if those teeth have had extensive restorative work and thus a poor longterm prognosis.
Dentistry,3dyf4y,prophywife,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you don't mean PREMOLARS? Molars are not usually extracted for ortho and almost all traditional orthodontists are taught to remove premolars to gain space. Since you mentioned you have an overjet and an overbite, it sounds like you have a skeletal Class II jaw and traditional orthodontists often extract premolars to ""correct"" these types of bites. However, bicuspid extraction treatment will not correct any skeletal problems and will worsen your facial profile, making your nose and chin more prominent and the area around your mouth dished in. Functional orthodontics will correct Class II jaws and often without extractions."
Dentistry,3dyf4y,tooth975,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"yes, premolars.  Nose + chin more prominent? Mouth dished in? I need all of those, lol."
Dentistry,3dyf4y,tooth975,2,Tue Jul 21 04:52:04 2015 UTC,"A better way of saying it is your present convex profile will be made worse.

Dentistry,3dy5f5,maerad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"If you don't take proper care of your teeth, and you go years without cleanings, of course the bit of your teeth that your retainer was glued to is going to look so much whiter than the rest of your teeth. The ""raised"" bit is probably the cement/composite that was used to adhere the retainer to your teeth.   Go to your appointment and get your exam and cleaning. Ask the dentist about a new retainer, or ask him to clean up what's left of your old one. IDK how much a new lingual retainer costs, but it's not nearly as expensive as getting braces again later on after your teeth have shifted. If you just want him to clean up the cement, he'll probably do that for free/very cheap."

We ran behind schedule apparently, so I didn't really get to ask post questions I wanted to.   I was wondering if you could answer some for me? I had a lot of pain when he was injecting the left upper side. He said that that might be infected. The pull itself there didn't hurt, but within a few minutes pain started up in that site. Dull at first, then sharper. It's pretty sore even though the novacaine isn't worth off there. Is that something I should watch closely? If it is infected will the antibiotics I was given cover it or should I be on the lookout for something there?  I was also wondering if I should wait before eating and how long I should wait.   Also how long is bleeding supposed to last? Right side seems to be slowing down but the left (where two were pulled) is using up gauze like crazy"

Dentistry,3dxnne,Michigesseo,3,Mon Jul 20 11:32:50 2015 UTC,"My experience has been that I have a removable retainer for my lower teeth, and I floss most nights. I imagine it's easier to do than with a permanent fixed one. I specifically requested not to have a fixed one. I've had my removable retainer for 10 years and haven't lost it. I got a second one made last month so I can keep one at my partner's place.   If you're motivated to wear your lower retainer and this improves your ability to floss, I don't see a problem. But I'm only a student so it's quite possible that /u/Kanzar has the better answer."
Dentistry,3dxnne,millerforceps,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"I don't have any fixed retainers, but imho a lot of patients can't be trusted to wear or not lose their removeable retainers. There's many a story where someone went travelling OS and their baggage was stolen, or misplaced, or even lost closer to home. It happens, and it's not like you can just get a replacement within a week like I could for myself.   If they're annoying you that much, ask for a v-loop/hygienic fixed retainer. It'll cost you a bit, but at least you can floss normally."
Dentistry,3dwe1e,thebrightesttimeline,14,Mon Jul 20 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"1 I wouldn't recommend chain dental offices to any person and I don't think many people on this sub would disagree.   2 ~$230 per filling with no insurance is certainly not unreasonable . . . though that will vary by location.  3 Yes it is possible for you to have a cavity that bad since there's a lot doctors can't see until they actually start to drill.  4 I don't know the doctor so there is no way I can personally critique their work but a lot of doctors that work for chains are pressed to produce numbers. meaning that they tend to have a mill mentality (ie. bring them in push them out as fast as possible). Generally the people that go to the chains go there because they have to because they take their insurance.   If it were me and I had to pay cash I would ask around and choose a non-chain doctor, because they are more likely to spend the time and have the materials to best resolve your problems. That's one of the main advantages of paying cash."

Before my wife and I got married, she was on shitty insurance and wouldn't ask me to help pay for a real dentist. We've spent more-even after my really good insurance-paying to fix the stuff they completely messed up, and she'll likely need to crown a tooth that never really needed more than a single filling.   From my view, Aspen and their type employ, by and large, incompetent or corrupt hacks that shouldn't be trusted near a sharp object of any kind, much less one going near anyone's mouth.   I'm sure there are some decent dentists working there, but I can't see taking a risk. Find a good dentist and stick with them. It makes a huge difference."

As a comparison, my dental school charges about 100-150 depending on where the filling is.  As for the second question, it is very common to have teeth that borders on root canal without having any pain (asymptomatic).

Dentistry,3dx59j,V3rsed,0,Mon Jul 20 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"A tooth that has had a successful root canal has no temperature receptors whatsoever, so it can't be 'sensitive' to hot or cold. Thus if you're feeling sensitive on THAT tooth for sure (sometimes hard to tell and it's really tooth in front or behind) then there is usually an entire part of the nerve that was missed and would require a second look/possible retreat of the root canal."

It sounds like the dentist tried adjusting the bite so you weren't hitting the filling too hard with the opposing tooth.  How has it felt since then?  Has it felt better?  You are always encouraged to get a second opinion if you have any doubts but it looks like your dentist is following protocol for post op sensitivity."

Dentistry,3dvusq,tooth975,18,Sun Jul 19 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree.  Post op sensitivity happens even if every imaginable precaution is taken and every manufacturer instruction is followed.  Quite frankly, dentistry is not a perfect science so whenever you do any procedure, less than favorable outcomes can occur.  You are technically causing harm to the tooth so just like any other part of the body, sometimes it takes time to heal.    The thing that annoys me more than anything is a dentist who bashes another dentist without knowing the facts.  Is it possible there is a high pulp horn that is close to the filling?  Have you seen the radiographs? Have you never had a patient experience reversible pulpitis?  If you've never had post op sensitivity then you either haven't placed enough fillings or you over treat root canals. Before you go and throw the dentist under the bus, give the him/her the benefit of a doubt.  Sheesh."
Dentistry,3dvusq,rossdds,5,Mon Jul 20 00:14:14 2015 UTC,Nicely said!
Dentistry,3dvusq,jumbo1100,-13,Mon Jul 20 00:18:22 2015 UTC,"Chewing sensitivity occurs for different reasons than temperature sensitivity. The OP is experiencing chewing discomfort. This happens all the time because of improper resin technique.  If this is an amalgam filling (I doubt it) then what I'm saying doesn't apply.   Exposing a pulp horn is very different than not. Proximity to the pulp itself, as long as it is not exposed and sealed properly, shouldn't make one bit of difference in post op sensitivity.   I never claimed I didn't have post op sensitivity. I claimed a properly done resin will not allow any. Sometimes I cut corners, sometimes the scenario doesn't allow for ideal isolation. This will create post op sensitivity.   Fuck off."
Dentistry,3dvusq,adthe1,3,Mon Jul 20 00:21:26 2015 UTC,If the proximity to the pulp has nothing to do with risk of post operative sensitivity then why do you think things like liners and bases exist?
Dentistry,3dvusq,rossdds,2,Mon Jul 20 00:29:08 2015 UTC,"Because most dentists like to believe anecdotal evidence and personal experience over actual scientific literature.

Dentistry,3dtpzh,Kanzar,3,Mon Jul 20 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bacteria thing. Some people have great habits and get cavities all day long, and others have poor habits/hygiene and don't get cavities very quickly or easily. Your oral flora plays a huge role. Maybe you can call that luck."
Dentistry,3dtpzh,ToothJanitor,2,Sun Jul 19 13:26:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm also helping by using high fluoride paste, ensuring I go in regularly for cleans, making sweet and sour foods a 'sometimes' thing, and when I brush I inspect my teeth to ensure I've gotten everything... Too many patients here come in with mature plaque everywhere and claim they brush twice daily for two minutes. I call bs.   My mother has cavities (active within the last five years too) so if I were to inherit any bacteria it would have been from her or my nanny from the Philippines but I don't recall her oral status... Kinda doubt hers was any better."

Dentistry,3dtpzh,ToothJanitor,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:25 2015 UTC,Brush morning and night with a Sonicare. Tongue scrape w/GUM tongue scraper. Floss before bed w/Crest Glide floss and follow up with Crest Pro Health rinse. Yes I know everyone hates Pro Health BUT I LIKE THE RINSE DAMMIT.  Considering I haven't had a cavity in 5 years I guess my routine's working.  Edit: forgot to mention I brush after lunch at work too. I eat a lot of garlic and Indian food so it's a necessity.

Dentistry,3dtpzh,cementicIes,4,Sun Jul 19 12:09:38 2015 UTC,It can make your tissue slough and the toothpaste is abrasive as hell.
Dentistry,3dtpzh,Ostracized,2,Sun Jul 19 13:45:42 2015 UTC,It causes side effects for some people. I used the mouthwash just one time and had a metallic taste in my mouth and burning tongue sensation for over a week.

When brushing, I'll brush each tooth surface for about 5 seconds.  ~90-120 seconds total.   Right now I'm using Clinpro5000 toothpaste, but I'll use whatever I can steal from the office.

Chew sugar free gum after meals throughout the day. Have a can of diet coke everyday but otherwise diet is pretty tooth-friendly.

Dentistry,3dv0z5,DiamondBurInTheRough,2,Sun Jul 19 22:01:05 2015 UTC,They don't want to hear dental facts thrown at them in a personal statement.

Dentistry,3dv0z5,DiamondBurInTheRough,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"Shadow. Volunteer. Extracurriculars are always good. Show through your life experiences how you will be organised, mature and suitable to the traits you'd want in a good dentist.  Some of the more personal questions they asked in my interview included   What made you want to do dentistry? What do you think are some problems with dentistry? How do you deal with stress?   I walked away from my interview knowing I'd get an offer because I knew my answers impressed them. I did zero reading about Dentistry but I did plenty of things such as shadowing."
Dentistry,3dv0z5,rossdds,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"It shows that you can memorize dental facts. That's not impressive to them...that won't raise you above the pack of applicants.   Shadow different specialties but focus on general dentistry. They're interested in grooming dentists so they want to see that you have spent some time in dental offices.   Volunteer. Not just dentally, but obviously that looks good on an application.   Take classes/take on activities involving artistic elements or manual dexterity. I play 3 instruments I learned how to knit. My friend was really good at solving a Rubik's cube in under a minute. Pottery classes are a plus.   Look online at dental schools recommended upper level science courses and take as many as you can in undergrad.   My college had a science department recommendations committee...see if that's available at your school. If not, try to get a recommendation from a dentist.   Do mock interviews. Have more unique answers. Don't say you want to be a dentist to help people....everyone coming to dental school wants to help people. Get creative.   In all honesty though, your grades and shadowing are the two most important aspects this early on. Don't waste your time reading dental literature. It won't get you anywhere."

Dentistry,3dv0z5,materix01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why? Don't get ahead of yourself yet. The best way to get information in the field is to shadow a dentist...reading won't really do much besides confuse you. There's a lot of different viewpoints in dentistry and what you read may go against what you're taught in a few years.   For example, I had a friend who firmly believed when cutting a crown prep that the walls should be vertical. They taught us in school that we should have 6-8 degree taper. So reading that didn't benefit him at all since he had to relearn it based on what our professors wanted."
Dentistry,3dv0z5,materix01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:52 2015 UTC,Perhaps there are books which are much more introductory? For example I found this  Which seems a good introduction. Is this too much aswell and could have different viewpoints too?

Dentistry,3dv0z5,carlsab,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"Not much to read. Might be helpful reading dental anatomy and doing sketches of tooth anatomy but without feedback on the sketches, it may not be the most productive use of your time."

Dentistry,3dusxj,DrDremel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:26 2015 UTC,Your pain and or swelling will likely continue to get worse until you on antibiotics or have the tooth worked on by a dentist. Not a lot of options here.

Dentistry,3dusxj,materix01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:34:15 2015 UTC,Call your dentist and see if they can phone in an antibiotic for you to your local pharmacy. There should be an emergency number on the voicemail of the main office.   You'll need to get the tooth taken care of though...an antibiotic will eliminate the current infection but it will recur if the source of the infection (the tooth) isn't treated.

If the infection is in the cellulitis stage, antibiotics MIGHT be able to help the body's defenses.  However, antibiotics are not able to reach an area of abscess, which has only one mode of treatment: surgical.  If there is any pus in that region, the best thing to do is either arrange for an emergency dental visit or go to the ED"
Dentistry,3dusxj,snozzleberry,0,Sun Jul 19 20:30:54 2015 UTC,Also amoxil can make the swelling worse. Needs I&D.

Dentistry,3dusxj,DiamondBurInTheRough,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"With the antibiotic, leaving it for a day or two isn't a huge deal. Definitely schedule an appointment as soon as your dentist gets back though because you need to treat the tooth ASAP.   If, for some reason, the swelling starts to affect your airway, you need to head to the ER immediately."

Dentistry,3dtv06,prophywife,7,Sun Jul 19 12:47:33 2015 UTC,Because we have no control over what patients do with their mouths when they leave the office.
Dentistry,3dtv06,afrothunder1987,3,Sun Jul 19 12:53:59 2015 UTC,"I take great care of my teeth. Floss, brush, use act 2X daily, religiously. I've had no other problems since the crown. Don't you think this suggests it was not done very well? My current dentist even suggested as much."
Dentistry,3dtv06,prophywife,4,Sun Jul 19 13:01:03 2015 UTC,Bashing previous dentist's work is an easy and lecherous way of gaining patient confidence.  I see shit work walk in the door all the time but the only time I ever talk about the quality of other dentist's work is when it's good.
Dentistry,3dtv06,michdent,2,Sun Jul 19 15:57:11 2015 UTC,Don't you think this suggests it was not done very well?   Nope. There are a lot of reasons crowns can fail. Why did you need a crown in the first place?
Dentistry,3dtv06,batsofburden,3,Sun Jul 19 13:03:23 2015 UTC,I had a root canal and then they put the crown on. When I was younger I took terrible care of my teeth. A few years ago I had some issues so since then I've been religious about dental care.
Dentistry,3dtv06,michdent,0,Sun Jul 19 13:44:46 2015 UTC,"Root canal teeth on average last 15 years. Then they either break, or become infected again. That means that some last 2 weeks and some last 30 years, and the average is 15.   Without seeing the X-rays and the tooth, but if things broke and can't be repaired? My guess is the tooth broke from being weakened by the root canal..."
Dentistry,3dtv06,dwarvendaycare,3,Sun Jul 19 14:04:44 2015 UTC,"If root canals only last 15 years on average, why do dentists even recommend them at all?  Isn't an implant a longer lasting solution?  Is it just economics, or is there a reason dentists recommend root canals over implants?"
Dentistry,3dtv06,afrothunder1987,2,Tue Jul 21 10:01:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. In your example where the root canal lasts 2 weeks. Hypothetically, say the patient pays $1,500 for the root canal/crown and it fails two weeks later. Then the patient has to pay $5,000 for an implant. Do you think the patient should have to bear that cost alone? Isn't the dentist partially responsible for determining whether the crown is a viable option?"
Dentistry,3dtv06,Versatyle07,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"It would be nice if it worked that way. At my office we'd probably try to help out and defer some of the cost if we could.  But like many of the others have said, there are no guarantees in life or dentistry. There are so many variables that affect the longevity of things, beyond the quality of the work and materials the dentist puts in.   I would say that for most dentists, if you're reasonable and calm then you are more likely to get help.   The thing is about it, we have no way of knowing whether it will fail in two weeks or 30 years. The root canal failing, the tooth itself breaking and the crown breaking are three VERY separate and different events that may or may not have anything to do with each other."
Dentistry,3dtv06,prophywife,2,Sun Jul 19 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"I ask 100 people, and everybody says that."
Dentistry,3dtv06,prophywife,3,Sun Jul 19 13:07:47 2015 UTC,"I believe that that's true, but I have no reason to lie to you now."
Dentistry,3dtv06,drillnfill,3,Sun Jul 19 13:43:46 2015 UTC,It would probably cost more to hire a lawyer than your crown cost.
Dentistry,3dtv06,prophywife,4,Sun Jul 19 12:54:38 2015 UTC,You'd be hard pressed to find a lawyer that would even take that case.
Dentistry,3dtv06,asdf12311,5,Sun Jul 19 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the sense people think I'm being unreasonable.  Is it impossible to imagine that the dentist did a bad job?  And if he did, is it unreasonable that I'd want to hold him accountable?"
Dentistry,3dtv06,cementicIes,5,Sun Jul 19 13:47:44 2015 UTC,"What makes you think he/she did a bad job? You mention not taking care of your teeth and needing a root canal, both suggestive of a large cavity. It is likely that your tooth was highly compromised due to decay."
Dentistry,3dtv06,cementicIes,3,Sun Jul 19 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"I had the procedure done at an emergency clinic, in a moment of distress, after moving to a new area.  They also tried to talk me into various other costly procedures and a surgery, which 3 other dentists said was ludicrous.  Since going there, my primary dentist, and the two dental surgeons who took out my wisdom teeth, have warned me of that clinic. It has a terrible reputation. One surgeon went to dental school with the ""bad dentist"" in question, and personally warned me of their terrible performance even back in school.  The facilities were unclean and unprofessional. The dentist seemed to struggle to get the ""bite"" correct on the new crown. I don't know if this is bad or not, but they filed it down so that the metal was visible.  After the procedure, the clinic spammed me constantly with texts telling me to sign up to win a free iPad. Yes, the clinic was running iPad giveaways."
Dentistry,3dtv06,cementicIes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:05:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the bad experience. You could have sought care elsewhere, though, right? I am assuming you allowed them to do both the root canal and crown? Bad dentistry exists of course but that doesn't mean it happened here. If the crown was done poorly we would know and assuming you saw a dentist every six months they would have brought it to your attention. You could post xrays of the tooth before and after treatment if you want more info."
Dentistry,3dtv06,cementicIes,3,Sun Jul 19 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yes, I could have gone elsewhere. I definitely made a mistake in choosing my healthcare provider.   Yes I do go to the dentist every 6 months, but I missed my last appointment so it had been 9 until yesterday. When I went in after the tooth broke, he commented that the crown was poorly constructed. His hygienist said he never had a crown he's done personally break in under 10 years--probably hyperbole.  Honestly, just I'm feeling frustrated that I'm making multi-thousand dollar purchases that impact my health, with no assurance of quality or that I'm doing the right thing. I'm fortunate that I can absorb this cost without assuming debt but there's no less of a sting.  I do have the x-rays that were taken yesterday. I'm heading out now but I will post them later when I return.  Thanks again."
Dentistry,3dtv06,Versatyle07,6,Sun Jul 19 14:17:48 2015 UTC,Anyone who tells you they've never had a crown break in under 10 years is a liar.

Dentistry,3dtv06,kghyr8,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:45 2015 UTC,"Sweet jesus... not much tooth left. This is what it looks like now (as opposed to before the crown)? For what it's worth I don't ask my patients to jump through hoops to get implants to replace second molars so that's always an option, too."
Dentistry,3dtv06,rossdds,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what it looks like now. Do you mean sometimes it's OK to not get an implant at all? If I just have a ""gap"" after having the remnant pulled, does that hurt the teeth above/around it?"
Dentistry,3dtv06,nothinqness,0,Mon Jul 20 00:01:21 2015 UTC,What other procedures and surgeries did they try to get you to do?
Dentistry,3dtv06,NC_Law,0,Sun Jul 19 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"So, I think we all feel for you. The problem is that a clinic like that will not be interested in making you satisfied as a patient. They already have your money, and you've been going elsewhere for treatment, so they really don't expect you to ever come back. It's a crummy way to do business, but it's one of the reasons they have a poor reputation. Your best bet is to have no more contact with them, and continue having work done by a dentist who has earned your trust.   We'd love to see your xrays when you get back."
Dentistry,3dtv06,V3rsed,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I just made a bad choice of clinic.   Thanks for offering to look at the xray.

Dentistry,3dtpoq,ortho85,0,Sun Jul 19 11:05:56 2015 UTC,What are you taking for the pain?  Duration of anaesthetic has a number of physiological and pharmicological factors.  Maybe they gave different anaesthetics on either side of your face.
