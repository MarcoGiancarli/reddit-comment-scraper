Punny,3ckm9a,datums,39,Thu Jul 9 00:15:12 2015 UTC,"Wrong. The capital of Russia is ""R""."
Punny,3ckm9a,Karunamon,13,Wed Jul 8 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"Don't you mean ""Я""?"
Punny,3ckm9a,kilkil,13,Wed Jul 8 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"That letter is pronounced ""ya"" in Russian. It has nothing to do with the English letter ""R"" except for the symmetry in shape.   The Cyrilic letter that sounds like ""r"" is ""Р"".   Also, the Cyrilic letter that sounds like ""p"" is ""П""."
Punny,3ckm9a,no-fun-at-parties,2,Wed Jul 8 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Also ""Hobo"" is pronounced ""Novo"", as in New. It cracks me up to look at a Russian map and see ""Hobo"" all over the place. Lots of hobos in Russia.   Conversely, think about it for US cities: New York would be Hobo Иорк (if you translated the 'new' instead of transliterating, as seems to be the case on actual Russian maps.)."
Punny,3ckm9a,kilkil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:06:04 2015 UTC,"Well, kind of. I mean, if you wanted to say ""new car"", you'd say ""новая машина"" (""novaya mashina"" in Latin letters). Similarly, if you wanted to say ""new phone"", you'd say ""новый телефон"" (""novii telefon"" in Latin letters). Actually, the Latin letters aren't exact equivalents, because the pronunciation is different than what you'd expect based on the Latin letters. But the point is that ""ново"" isn't the actually Russian adjective meaning ""new"".   Also (fun fact), ""New York"" is literally called that in Russian. Like, they don't translate the ""new"" part, they just spell it out in Cyrillic letters. Same with words like telephone, computer, machine, chai, business, businessman, and president, to name a few."
Punny,3ckm9a,no-fun-at-parties,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"It seems like it might be right to say that a particular declension of 'New', as it is elided to form a prefix in a compound word, is 'ново-' - does that sound less wrong to you?   I do happen to be familiar with a fair portion of the Cyrillic alphabet. Some of that is from taking a semester of ancient Greek in college; some from landing in Russia in [Geoguessr](Geoguessr.com) while my Russian roommate is around.  I looked up maps.google.com.ru and saw that it was transliterated rather than translated, which is why I edited phrasing of my comment the way I did. I find that interesting, as the only foreign language I know reasonably well, Spanish, tends to translate the non-proper portions of proper names - e.g. New York is Nueva York."
Punny,3ckm9a,kilkil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"Lol, I don't know what ""declension"" means.   But yeah, ново does seem to be used quite a bit when naming places. Maybe it's a relic of some older version of Russian."
Punny,3ckm9a,no-fun-at-parties,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:43 2015 UTC,"In many languages, the endings of nouns change according to how they function in a sentence (subject, direct object, indirect object, others), usually following a pattern associated with the noun's gender; that is called a declension. Adjectives change to match the gender and declension of the noun they modify.  In case Russian is your first language, the offered Russian-language equivalent of the Wiki article on the topic (via the Languages bar on the left) is: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Склонение_(лингвистика)"

Punny,3cavat,DarcyRouge,3,Tue Jul 7 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe they were worried about preserving the logo   If a trademark owner tweaks and modifies their own trademarks too much, it becomes more difficult to win infringement cases with third parties.  Nabisco's trademark claim on ""OREO"" is likely defined very narrowly including the exact dimensions of the logo, what colors it can appear in (pantone numbers), etc.  If Nabisco makes ""S'moreos"" then someone else might make a desert called ""Moreozipan"" or an adult beverage called a ""Memoreosa"".  If Nabisco can't clearly draw a line between which versions are authorized adaptations of the logo and which are not, they would have a lot of difficulty winning a copyright infringement case.  This sort of thing prevents Disney from suing everyone who makes a logo with a cartoon mouse."

Punny,3cavat,brayney12,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"I can pretty much guarantee that that would have been suggested at several points in the development process of this, and run through marketing teams and focus groups.  Huge companies are VERY particular about their branding. It's not necessarily that they can't tamper with the logo, though that's part of it. It creates a disconnect with the company, with the brand/trademark, and with product discovery.  For instance, search engines and SEO. ""Oreo"" and ""S'mores"" are both well-known terms, and people can use them in wordlists as things people may search for, or as being related to people's searches. But unless someone already knows ""Smoreos"" are a thing, there's no way anyone would naturally search for that term, and they'd be less likely to click it as an advertisement link because they might not understand what it is. Consumers can be dumb.  To properly market to that name, they'd need to have all three: ""Smore's Oreos: Smoreos!"" or something to that effect, and they probably decided it just wasn't worth it. Beyond that, this sort of controversy about the naming is just adding free publicity to the product."
