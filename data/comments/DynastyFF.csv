DynastyFF,3e71pg,GI_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:59:06 2015 UTC,Yeah i saw when you guys were drafting! Craziness. NPLB is approaching that level of insanity. 70man balanced ughhh
DynastyFF,3e6w7d,Vacar,3,Wed Jul 22 12:32:11 2015 UTC,No rant today.  less than 3 weeks till preseason... life's good. :)
DynastyFF,3e6w7d,eaf_marine,3,Wed Jul 22 13:03:55 2015 UTC,Seriously!!!!  Only 3 weeks! This made my day. I haven't been keeping up with dates at all
DynastyFF,3e6w7d,username02,3,Wed Jul 22 13:54:18 2015 UTC,"Not a rant per se:   During this off-season I have started to participate more in this sub. I have joined several more dynasty leagues (most of them filled by other people from this sub) and the one thing I can say is that I have enjoyed the challenge immensely. Not only because of the challenge that has come with drafting these start up teams, but the fact that everyone is trying to implement their own strategy to the best of their abilities. So many times I have been in leagues where a draft or waiver period doesn't go someone's way and it seems like they are just out of it for the rest of the season.  /r/dynastyff has rapidly become my favorite sub and the people here are top notch."
DynastyFF,3e6vck,PizzaLogs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:23:13 2015 UTC,"8-team leagues usually contain rosters of studs and duds (with the hope they blossom into studs). Personally, I'd target top QBs rounds 1 and 2. If you can lock up 2 of Luck, Rodgers, Wilson, or Cam then you should have your QB position solidified for seemingly the next 7-10 years. After that, impact WRs/RBs turnover rapidly and typically start young (unlike QBs). I wouldn't use many roster spots for guys like VJax/MWallace which add depth, because that's not going to help you win. I'd go for either proven studs at WR/RB or high ceiling potential. I'd take Patterson/Austin on the bench over someone like Colston for the sheer fact that they if they land with a different team (say the Eagles) their upside soars way beyond someone like Colston who is a security blanket that never finds your active lineup anyways. Also, don't underestimate the value of QBs. If everyone is seemingly loading up on WR/RBs and someone like Tannehill or even Winston/Mariota is there at a great value pick, pick them! That could become a big trade asset in the future to help acquire big rookie picks and/or proven talent. Lastly, please for the love of all that is good do NOT draft more than 1K or 1DEF. I'd argue not to draft any, and just load up on rookies/deep sleepers until the season starts. In an 8 team league, you will have no problem streaming a K/DEF.  EDIT: Completely missed this was auction. I assumed snake. Oops!"
DynastyFF,3e6vck,aussiemac24,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:50:25 2015 UTC,First thing first: Luck and Rodgers should/will be expensive. You need to decide right now if going after a tier 1 QB is your plan.  With .5 PPR and the ability to start 5 WRs I might try to sneak some good value on young WRs while everyone else is scrambling to lock down their QBs.
DynastyFF,3e7dhw,tu_tall_jones,2,Wed Jul 22 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"I had a long answer typed out then I changed my mind.  I would see if they trade Stafford for Burfict, Williams + 1.11. Wagner is just too valuable with that scoring imo. Stafford would be an upgrade to your QBs, and you could then drop/shop Mett and try to sell Foles to someone who has a weak QB2?  Kendricks and Anthony aren't really a reach at those picks. I think I would prefer to get them starting at the 2.06, but I'm a believer in Kendricks. I think Anthony can do quite well.  Side note: Not sure if you have any later picks, but I would look to trade back in if Dante Fowler starts to fall."

DynastyFF,3e6896,Cavemansol,2,Wed Jul 22 14:49:38 2015 UTC,"You robbed him blind. I personally wouldnt have given Gronk for Charles, Olsen, and Davis. The fact you also got Abdullah and a 1st is insane. With your team I'D say you are the clear favorite."

The other owner jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, and he lay without quivering.  /u/Paloma_II shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from him, back up the bank, near the pile of old ashes.""  you killed him"

DynastyFF,3e6896,Cavemansol,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"Looks like that would put you in a scenario where your 2015 season success depends heavily on Gordon getting off to a very strong start. I would say it's a good trade on balance, since you have definite long term gain and in the short term you still have a chance at an overall upside.   I think Olsen is a real question mark. I think there's a strong chance he may disappoint. So I think the short term upside is better than you're thinking.  How many WRs do you start? I ask because unless you have to start 4+, you would have been better off losing some depth there. Or at least maybe now you could package something like Cadet and Alshon for a significant upgrade at RB and another 2017 pick."
DynastyFF,3e5l5q,dparsons182,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:17:00 2015 UTC,How do you find each player's relative value?
DynastyFF,3e5l5q,injusticeforme,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:03:15 2015 UTC,"That's not an easy problem to solve. We don't know how a traded player will be used on his new team, especially in the case of somebody like Graham. Seattle barely used their TE's last season, but Graham is a huge upgrade. His stats will probably fall somewhere between what the Seattle TE's did last season (since he's better than they are) and what he did in New Orleans (since Seattle doesn't throw as much). However, there's no perfect way to predict where in that range he'll fall."
DynastyFF,3e5l5q,m_plis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:52:57 2015 UTC,"You create a spreadsheet with each player's relative value?! The most that I do is figure out the relative value of each position. I consider player evaluation to be completely different.  My evaluation of Jimmy Graham is that his new situation is worse. He's moved from a high-volume pass-first offense to a low-volume run-first offense. I think Graham is going to get a big slice of the pie in Seattle, and I think his red zone work stays the same. (I'm not dinging Graham because Lynch might take touchdowns away.) But especially in a PPR league, the volume drop makes a difference."
DynastyFF,3e5l5q,slodanslodan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:10:27 2015 UTC,"Closest thing I can think of for this is Tony G going from KC to Falcons. He decreased a little, but he was still productive asset. You could also argue age was a factor as much as changing location. At other positions, you see supreme talent typically stays consistent. TO, Desean Jackson, Randy Moss, etc. For the most part, those guys didn't see much of a change in stats when they changed teams. I would error on the side of things staying the same more than changing. I would also add, this should especially be your perspective in a dynasty league. For all you know Graham gets traded next year to Pats/Broncos to make room for Wilson's future contract....."
DynastyFF,3e5567,Victoriaus,3,Wed Jul 22 01:04:52 2015 UTC,"LB is so deep, I always wait.  Unless someone good really falls to you, its better to wait.  I think you need to hit WR really hard now. Hopefully you can get some sophomore receivers, those would be best. Cooks/Jmatt/Arob/KB  Awesome start imo"
DynastyFF,3e5567,Sticky_Z,2,Wed Jul 22 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"Agree with this (wait on LB, hit young good WRs hard). However, if IDP scoring is really high, even the next tier of DLs after Watt can be big advantages. How do guys like Quinn and JPP score (though I wouldn't advocate JPP here due to injury concerns)? What about the 12th best DL?  However, I do agree that if guys like Cooks and Matthews are available, I'd take them in a heartbeat."

DynastyFF,3e5ah6,mr_jackwagon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the superflex I'm in with my friends. I think it's the future of dynasty setups and you'll see a lot more sites cover them.   As far as strategy, I would highly suggest targeting QBs from the jump, especially if you think you can ensure one of the Luck/Rodgers/Cam/Wilson quartet. QBs are going to be increasingly harder to trade for once all your league mates figure out how sparse QBs become when two can be started.   The extra bump in scoring for TE receptions also increases the value of the upper tier of TEs. Gronk most definitely becomes a backup plan if you fail to grab a top tier QB. In all honesty, depending on how the auction shakes out early, I would suggest targeting QB-TE and leave the WRs and RBs. There are a lot of quality WRs that will be available late.   Good luck with your new league, and enjoy!"
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,NOLA_NOLA_NOLA_NOLA,4,Tue Jul 21 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"No need to look at any team other than All Pro SEC if you ask me. One of the top QBs is the league for a win now team, and one of the best young QBs behind him. By far the best WR lineup with OBJ, Julio, Cobb, and Hopkins. Good RBs for winning right now and for building for the future. Kelce Thomas and Cameron at TE means he is set there as well. That team looks unbelievable.   If I had to rank my next couple favorites, they would be Byronic Sideboob, Spoink FC, and Autodraft Allstars.   My least favorite teams would have to be New Money Franchise, 100% Peculiar, and Wrecking Crew."
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Dr_Lollygag,5,Tue Jul 21 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"No need to look at any team other than All Pro SEC    I honestly stopped reading to come look at the comments after I saw that team. That's tough to pull off in an 8 team league, let alone a 12. Lots of pick trading?"
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,xlShadylx,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"This is the 3rd year, 2014 All Pro SEC traded Riley Cooper to New Money Franchise for his 2.03, which turned into OBJ. This off season Gio+ Justin Hunter+1.12 for Marshawn Lynch and 3.03 from Dumpster Fire.  The rest were drafted or free agent pick ups. Traded Vincent Jackson to Byronic Sideboob for Tannehill. So yeah there were 3-4 trades to get some of those pieces."

DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Figjammer,3,Wed Jul 22 03:37:53 2015 UTC,You guys haven't had your rookie draft yet? How could anybody sleep on The People's Champ. That squad is maybe two pieces away from total domination.
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Wetzilla,4,Tue Jul 21 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"I really like The People's Champ's roster. FYI I'm in that league, but that's not my team."
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,thefadd,3,Tue Jul 21 21:09:37 2015 UTC,Oh well well well... How about you write up the IDP's in a nice format then.
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Wetzilla,3,Tue Jul 21 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"He doesn't even have a solid player for the 2nd flex spot, and has no depth or decent starting TE. He's a few pieces away from competing, never mind dominating."
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Wetzilla,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"He has first round talent at each of the 3 major positions. With arguably 4 of the Top 15 players in redraft or dynasty, he won't need a complete roster.  All 4 of those guys will continue to be peak elite players at their position for 3-4 years. He's got a large window to get lucky, which is why I mentioned that they don't even appear to have rookies on their rosters yet.  Anyway, I'd take that roster easily. All Pro SEC can't compare at QB or RB."
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Figjammer,2,Wed Jul 22 05:57:29 2015 UTC,"Aaron Rodgers is not a first round talent, nor is he a top 15 pick in dynasty or redraft. He's close, but he's still outside of the top 15. And All Pro DOES have 4 of the top 15 players in dynasty, and another top 10 redraft pick in Lynch. and I'd much rather have OBJ and Julio Jones than Evans and Green. Sure Rodgers is going to be better than Brady (and Tannehill for the first 4 games if the suspension is upheld, which I doubt) this year, but is he going to be that much better to make up for the difference in skill between Cobb and Hopkins, and Kenny Stills and Stevie Johnson? And Ellington and ANY of the other RBs People's Champ has? Or Kelce and Davis or Donnell? The gulf in talent between those players is far greater than Rodger's and Brady's, and Bell's and Lynch's. Also, if Bell's suspension isn't reduced, he's basically going to have no RB to start for the first three games this season. With such a weak roster, that's pretty much three guaranteed losses. There is no way I would take People's Choice roster over All Pro's."
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,Figjammer,3,Wed Jul 22 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"All Pro SEC is going to destroy this league. OBJ, Julio, Cobb, and Hopkins? That's 4 top 12 WRs. With only needing to start one RB, Lynch, Ellington, and Hyde are fine. At QB he's got a elite QB in Brady for however long he still plays, and has a great up and coming young QB to replace him with. And 3 top 10 TEs, I don't know how he managed to pull this off.  It's really hard for me to give a strict ranking, as a lot of these teams are really close, so I'll break them out into tiers. All Pro SEC is on a tier of his own. After him I'd probably put Autodraft Allstars and Sideboob in tier 2. Autodraft Allstars is pretty well stocked at each position. He is a little light at WR depth, but with both Murrays and Hill he should be ok with his flex spots. Sideboob has good depth, and good starters at all positions but TE, but considering he has Luck at QB I think he'll be fine with a slightly weaker TE.  Tier 3 is comprised of Spoink and Dude of Thrones. Spoink has some decent WRs, Gronk, and a couple of solid QBs. He is pretty weak at RB, with basically only AP. If anything happens to AP he's fucked. Dude of Thrones has a couple of top 10 WRs, decent depth at the position, and is pretty solid at all the other positions.  Tier 4 has Wrecking Crew, Dumpster Fire, and The Gumps in it. Wrecking Crew is really shallow at WR, he only has 4 WRs that are playing this year. Luckily they're all at least decent players, and his RBs make up for it a bit. TE is meh, but Qb is pretty ok with Bridgewater. Dumpster Fire is ok at WR, TE, and QB, but a little rough at RB. he's only got Bernard, who's a RB2 at best in .5 PPR, and then a flier in Helu. I like Helu, and think he'll have some RB2 and Flex value in Oakland, but there's also a good chance he does nothing. His good WRs are also older too, he'll need to rebuild in a few years. The Gumps is pretty solid everywhere but QB, if he had a slightly better QB I'd probably bump him up to the next tier.  Below them I have The Peoples Champ and Chaucy. Peoples Champ has Rodgers and a few decent WRs, but he's only got Bell at RB, and pretty crappy TEs. Chaucy only has two startable WRs, and only two solid RBs, bunch a bunch of RB lottery tickets, so he may get another starter or two from there. He's also got a decent TE and Qb, though no Qb backup is a bit rough.  And in the Bottom tier I have 100% peculiar and New Money. The only thing 100% Peculiar has going for them is Wilson, Hilton, and Decker. Forte is pretty good, but his receptions will take a huge hit this year, and how many years does he have left? And he has no TE for the first 4 weeks of the season. And New Money has Anderson and Charles, and that's about it. Vereen is ok, but I'd like him more if it was 1 PPR.  If I had to rank them I'd probably go   All Pro SEC  Auto Draft All Stars  Sideboob  Dude of Thrones  Spoink  Gumps  Wrecking Crew  Dumpster Fire  Chaucy  Peoples Champ  100% Peculiar  New Money  Edit: I just noticed in the screen shots there are defensive players listed on the rosters, is this an IDP league too? because that could dramatically change my rankings depending on the starting requirements and scoring."
DynastyFF,3e3wh7,doodwhersmycar,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's an IDP league, but I wasn't going to expect to go into that too, I guess I should add it all. Shit."
DynastyFF,3e4q6s,xxandl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:03:32 2015 UTC,"So in a non ppr, wide receivers lose some value and work horse backs definitely gain some. But that doesn't change the fact that you're lacking depth at wide out. FIX IT!  You have Gronk, the best tight end since my other boy tony G. You don't need graham. In fact, you could probably leave a spot open because you're starting Gronk (don't do that, did it once, barely made playoffs for the cockiness). Sell graham and get a nice wide receiver that can help you out. OBJ and Cobb are good with Matthews being your third. Wallace is good for a bye week. Whoever you get from graham should be another bye week guy or potentially better than Matthews. Make sure to target a guy who succeeds in NON ppr.  Besides that, you have 4 starting backs, two which you'll start, two which you'll flex. Ride em into oblivion.  Don't know much about IDP. Sorry."
DynastyFF,3e5uir,Napolamite,2,Wed Jul 22 04:42:47 2015 UTC,"Easiest question first. Don't drop Fitzpatrick, having him and Geno is ideal.   QBs: Fantastic. Ryan was a ridiculous steal at 34; he should've been gone in the early 2nd. Geno/Fitzpatrick are a totally fine QB3, I wouldn't worry about upgrading here.  RBs: In full PPR, Gio will be a top 20 RB and Vereen potentially as well. Murray has a ton of upside, but is a little risky as your RB1, to say the least :) Still, you've got a solid group of young guys to fill your 2 RB spots. Your RBs won't be leading the league by any means, but I don't think they'll hold you back.  WRs: You had your strategy and you stuck to it! Nice group of young receivers. Evans and Matthews are great. I think I'm a little lower on Martavis than many, but he should be a quality WR3 at worst. Johnson, Moncrief, Wright, and Randle are all startable WRs with upside, too. Hurns I'm not so sure about, but it doesn't hurt to stash him and see.  TEs: These look good. One of Eifert or Williams, if not both, should be a decent tight end this year or next. In the meantime, Daniels should be a startable TE. After the top 4 or 5, TEs are kind of a crapshoot anyway, so I wouldn't worry too much. You have youth and upside here.  Overall, I like your team! Without any heavy hitters at RB and WR this year (for example, I doubt any of them finish in the top 5 or 8 at their position), I don't think you'll make a strong championship run. But I like your chances at making the playoffs, and your roster is only going to get stronger in the future."
DynastyFF,3e5uir,blardorg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:51:52 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the well thought out responses! I was totally surprised by the lack of QBs drafted in the first few rounds and I wasn't expecting at the 10 spot to get Russell. Before the draft I was actually thinking I'd be deciding if I wanted Matt Ryan at 10 or if I could get him coming back at the 15 pick.  After I got Russell I took Evans at 15 never expecting that Ryan would still be there at my next pick (34) ...pleasantly surprised.
DynastyFF,3e5469,worldrallyx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Fuck you you got ODB at 12?!?!? I hate your guts.  Besides that, I think you went for best value available rather than a theme (win now, win later, only rb, etc etc). I think you took Edelman way too early tbh.  I would definitely target some starting running backs. When you get to 14/16 team leagues, finding two starting running backs is a pretty big deal. If you don't have two who start, you're only hurting yourself. Assuming kelce is gone and the top 5 qbs are also gone, wait another 3-4 rounds before going for either. Just stack up on running backs and wide receivers"
DynastyFF,3e5469,zadloo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:04:03 2015 UTC,That's what I plan on. I may reach for woodhead and cadet early
DynastyFF,3e5469,zadloo,2,Wed Jul 22 14:05:03 2015 UTC,"I would avoid both actually. Go for some rookies that are supposed to start. Idk who is left but latavius, Coleman, yeldon, Abdullah, David Johnson, duke Johnson, all guys I would go for before wood head and cadet. Look up dynasty ADP 2015 in Google and find the best rbs left that you can draft. That should help with some of your evaluations some and how people think of those players."
DynastyFF,3e3y3a,zadloo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:46 2015 UTC,I would do this trade all day if someone would give me it. I LOVE Nuk but AB is about as good as it gets in any form of PPR. Consistent as fuck.
DynastyFF,3e3y3a,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"Brown, all day.  Proven consistency at the top of his game beats young potential, imo.  It'd be one thing if he was in his twilight, but Brown's gonna keep on trucking long enough to hold on to.   You'd have to give me a 1.01, not a 1.07, to even make me take a second look."
DynastyFF,3e3y3a,Unpossible42,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Antonio Brown.   I like Big Ben to hang around for another 3 years. Don't see Texans getting a guy that can turn Hopkins into a 1700 yard ceiling guy like Brown had for a few years.

DynastyFF,3e49ff,DanManSully,3,Tue Jul 21 21:01:52 2015 UTC,"Hey man, You seem to be new to this community so let me give you a few tips before helping you out. First off, Always remember to say whether your league is ppr or standard, how QB scoring is, stuff like that. Also, Use formatting to make a vertical list of players, it's easier to read.  With that said Here's my analysis of your team assuming 4 pt QB TDs and PPR  QB   I love Teddy and think he can be a solid fantasy player for years and years to come, especially on your young team. Cutler is definitely a buy low candidate for me and I don't think his value can be any worse. Overall it's a good QB tandem!   RB    I love that you have Spiller, and Latavius Murray. Spiller's age isn't the best for your team but I don't think he has too much wear and tear. I believe he'll have a really good season with the Saints. I also expect Murray to be a 3 down back, that Raider offense is underrated imo. Forsett is a little old for your team, so I'd look to trade him ( maybe with one of your WR's) for a younger RB. Think guys like Jeremy Hill if you can. If not, it's not the end of the world   WR   I absolutely love your WR's. If this is your 1st dynasty draft then you killed it in this department since WR's RULE dynasty. I love that you have Evans and Cobb together with Amari Cooper and Allen robinson ( how is he a FA lol). Demaryius is also a stud, but I would look to trade him to help you in the RB department since your receivers are all so young. For Demaryius, I'd engage in talks with the Bell/Lacy/Hill owner. Ideally you could transform something like Forsett + Demaryius + a future 2nd for Hill and Hopkins or something like that. Just an idea   TE   not much to say here. Kelce is a great TE to have in dynasty, especially due to the longevity of the position and your team being very young. I would also tell you to grab somone like Clive Walford if he's still there in the rookie draft, but I doubt it. Just to have a backup... but it's not a big deal since your championship window is a few years down the road.   Overall  I really think you nailed it with this draft man! I'd definitely look to move "" older"" guys like Forsett and Demaryius, even CJ Spiller if you have to so you can get a little younger/better at the RB position. I'd also try seeing what the Jameis Winston owner wants for Jay Cutler. Maybe shop him around during the season to try to obtain Carr or Winston  Anyways, Hope you're active here in the community! Good Luck!"

DynastyFF,3e44n3,onlymycouchpullsout,3,Tue Jul 21 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Those were my thoughts. McKinnon, barring injury, is a long hold, where Ajayi might at least grab some action, or even overtake within a year."
DynastyFF,3e44n3,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"if you're in 100% rebuild, then I can see the argument for Mckinnon given Ajayi's knee. but if you aren't then he's the right pick!"
DynastyFF,3e44n3,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Tue Jul 21 20:56:52 2015 UTC,"I dig it - my overall strategy this year in drafting is pretty much punt-worthy, lots of high upside youngsters and rookies. Might that make McKinnon a bit worthier to hold? (Also looks like I just read that AP's only got guaranteed money for injury this year, and Vikes could cut him before next season, skipping the rest of the cash)"
DynastyFF,3e44n3,LincolnSteve,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:29 2015 UTC,Yea I saw. Its hard to say at this point man. Gotta go with the gut
DynastyFF,3e44n3,DontEatTheCandle,2,Wed Jul 22 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"Good point, keep in mind AP's contract also includes enough back loaded money and a $5M roster bonus for 2016 that if he gets injured or performs at a mere-human level the Vikings have some incentive to cut him. Not extremely likely, but still a possibility. Especially for a player who will be 31 at decision time.  I feel like Miami doesn't trust Miller with the lead role, but he keeps playing well enough that they don't have a choice. I guess will see how they really feel once they have to pay him."
DynastyFF,3e3jbq,C_COXY,7,Tue Jul 21 18:02:38 2015 UTC,Is that really your team?  Do you play in a 2 team league or something?  How can you possibly have a team that stacked?  And picks 1.01 and 1.03?!
DynastyFF,3e3jbq,peevepet,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Not too hard to imagine IMO. Probably bought low on Lacy's slow start and OBJ's injury. Bell and Hopkins both had upside last year but have gained a bunch of value this year.  And well Kelce was a basically rookie TE going into this year. Still though the rest of his team is pretty good, but he could have gone from great to elite."
DynastyFF,3e3jbq,PaoloPWD,4,Tue Jul 21 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"Not hard to imagine?  Really?  You guys must play with much different people in your league than mine.  This team listed above is an All-Star team.  It's a who's who of top fantasy RBs, top fantasy WRs, top fantasy TEs, the highest scoring kicker, the best IDP players (including Watt!), AND the 1.01 and 1.03 pick in the draft.  Seriously, if there are 9 other teams in your league that are letting you acquire this much talent, I feel like it's time you move on to a more competitive league."
DynastyFF,3e3jbq,peevepet,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people are so quick to dismiss teams like this. Yeah, it can be tiresome to see a stacked team like this wondering what they should do, but we don't know how long this league has been in place. He's got a lot of young players, but we don't know how he got them. It could have been 3 to 4 years of trades and shrewd drafting. Buying low on guys and hoping they pan out for the future.  It could also be that he plays with 9 potatoes and he just so happens to be their king."
DynastyFF,3e3jbq,username02,3,Tue Jul 21 19:39:27 2015 UTC,"Lol the latter reason for sure.

Had a stellar rookie year, then was plagued by injuries and a crappy o-line (I believe the worst in the league last year?).  Tampa got a couple fresh lineman, so hopefully that'll help. I don't believe in Sims being the guy like others do.  I wouldn't target him in startups for anything other than a really late flier, but I think there's still a chance he can turn it around."

DynastyFF,3e4gmz,Crimson-Chin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:03:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, it was tough to trade my 2nd and 3rd but to get 2 cornerstones in OBJ and Evans I think it was worth it. We're in the 9th round right now so there's some nice young developmental guys left along with some aging, dependable veterans. I'm happy with both my RBs and WRs right now, so I'll most likely be going BPA for the most part unless there's someone else I want."

DynastyFF,3e2yyu,macsouthphilly,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:33 2015 UTC,With 1.01 and 1.05 you should be able to beef up at WR for 2015. Giving up Garcon will be insignificant for your lineup. Who are you looking to select at 1.01?  I like Tannehill a lot over Winston in 2015 and your team should be able to compete. You have to add a QB one way or another. Relying on Kaepernick as a QB1 would be scary.  Looking at your roster will your 3rd and 5th rounders even survive your 20 man cut?
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,LincolnSteve,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'm split between Cooper and Gurley at 1.01, but I am pretty sure I'll go either Parker or Agholor (probably Parker) at 1.05 so that makes me lean towards Gurley at 1.01.  Not sure if my 3rd and 5th round picks would be better than anyone I would have to cut, so I may just cut my defense and kicker and then draft them again during the draft in the 3rd and 5th rounds."
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,LincolnSteve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"With Gurley you would be set at RB. He may not last as long as Cooper career-wise, but he could be a difference maker for you during the second half of the season and the playoffs.   Well, I would definitely make the deal for Tannehill and if that falls through I'd take Winston if he is there at 2.03."
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,mtbike,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd take that deal all day.
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,Brad227,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the slight over pay since your roster is pretty stacked but with such small roster sizes you have zero need for this many QBs. Drop two, drop the defense and the kicker unless you're required to keep them. See if you can trade your 5th rounder and a piece for a higher pick, like a third.  Also in a 10 teamer 2.3 is way more than what Tann is worth. You should be able to find guys on waivers to fill bye weeks easily."
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,boredatworkbored,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:35 2015 UTC,As a Tannehill owner that trade is in the ballpark but I'd probably need a little more. Your best bet will be to offer this trade when it's your turn to pick 2.03 and hope someone the guy covets is still available. Also if he doesn't have a great QB2 he might be very hesitant to move Tanny
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:38 2015 UTC,"Where does Tannehill sit on your trade partner's roster? I'm assuming he's a QB2 at best right? I just want to ensure there isn't too much risk for your trade partner.  I think the value is good for you. Some people view Tannehill as Top 5 QB, so if that's the case for your trade partner, he might not take it. Since you have to cut guys anyways, you could throw in Geno or something if need be. I do like the trade a lot for you. As others have mentioned, between your current WR depth and new draft picks, you will not miss Garcon at all."
DynastyFF,3e2yyu,Hawxfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"I just did something similar to avoid having to take a rookie qb this year. I think tannehill is going to continue to improve and with the new supporting cast I thinki he'll breakout this year. I traded 3.06, Jace Amaro, and Vincent Jackson for him, then lucked into getting Amari Cooper with my 1.06 pick. Winston was taken at 1.05 btw. You could take Cooper at 1.01 then maybe Yeldon at 1.05 and your QB/WR worries should be taken care of while still adding depth at RB. You never know who will fall to you at that 1.05 spot though, could be Gurley or Gordon."
DynastyFF,3e3dq6,I-Pessimist,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:54 2015 UTC,Roddy White and Vernon Davis seem to be the outliers here. Maybe try trading them off for a couple of picks?  I think it's a good team. Lots of potential to build on at the skill slots with a solid QB.
DynastyFF,3e3dq6,username02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:08 2015 UTC,I'm going to wait to flip them after week 1 (assuming they have decent weeks) maybe to a contender who needs a minor addition
DynastyFF,3e3dq6,goddammnick,2,Tue Jul 21 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think you have a VERY strong WR core right now, and your RB is not that bad either.   Sit tight and watch your team grow."

These guys value is only trending down. Like you said definitely ship them away but I guess wait for a decent week then do it. Picks or guys who need an injury to start, maybe like a Robert turbin or just second round picks I would gladly take. Enjoy watching this team grow!!"
DynastyFF,3e2cbh,username02,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"Isn't ""win-now"" kind of counter intuitive to the idea of dynasty?  In sports, a dynasty implies winning multiple championships over the course of several year (3 out of 5 for example), but often on this sub, ""win-now"" teams appear to only have 1 actual season of viability in terms of competing for a championship. Then what, blow it up an rebuild?  I apologize if this is one of those questions that doesn't really have an answer. Maybe I'm coming at it from the wrong angle.  P.S. What is you beer of choice?"
DynastyFF,3e2cbh,C_COXY,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"I'd like to cue the question, or concept rather: Why not maximize points per starting lineup spot?  To expand, in my league on Sundays we play 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX (RB/WR/TE), 1 DT, 1 DE, 2 LB, 1 CB, 1 S, 1 DP (DT/DE/LB/CB/S), and 1 K.  I often feel that people lose touch with what matters, their actual starting lineup. Yeah its great to stockpile WRs, but that won't do you any good on Sundays.  Guys like Gronk and Watt score absurd numbers for the slots they play in, boosting their value a ton IMO.  So why do I constantly see people with such oddly structured value?  You can find a handful of top-tier QB1 and WR1 producers, putting you on even ground with other owners who have such players at QB and WR.  But with guys who are total anomalies at their position (like Gronk and Watt), you're getting points in a slot that no one else is.  I feel like this is an important point to consider that many don't necessarily incorporate into their general strategy."
DynastyFF,3e2cbh,mtbike,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"1) Do's and Dont's when running a dynasty league.  2) ""Would you Rather"" (Gronk or Eddie Lacy)  (Luck or AJ Green)  (Hopkins or LeVeon)  (OBJ or Mike Evans) - one of you argue each way  (Mila Kunis or Scar-Jo)"

DynastyFF,3e2q6r,chkessle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:12 2015 UTC,I love your WR corps. Except for Gordon. I would trade Josh Gordon for half a stick of fruit stripe gum.   I also like the Jets defense this year. I think they will be pretty good with their CB additions and draft class.   I'd recommend grabbing another QB off waivers for the Phins bye.  I might also grab whoever emerges as Jon Stewart's backup for when he goes on IR.  That's about all. I'd say you made some good moves. Keep going in that direction of making good moves.
DynastyFF,3e2m28,aussiemac24,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:43 2015 UTC,In 2QB Dalton is probably worth more than all 3 of those players combined.
DynastyFF,3e2m28,username02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:32 2015 UTC,"I probably should have added this, but Dalton is his QB3 (Behind Romo and Stafford). He also seems to favor Manziel more than Dalton. I don't necessarily agree, but I figured McCown would be a good insurance plan for his faith in Manziel.   That being said, I don't completely disagree that Dalton has real value in a 2QB league. Do you still think this is a wildly off balanced trade offer?"
DynastyFF,3e2m28,username02,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"Just because he was someone's QB3 doesn't mean he doesn't hold value. Maybe I am higher on Dalton than some, but I think he is easily worth McCown + Daniels + VJax."
DynastyFF,3e2m28,peckx063,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"I think VJax is worth more than pick 21, slightly.  However, in a 20 QB league a young starter who can put up serviceable numbers is worth much more than what you stated. I take the trade."

DynastyFF,3e2i3y,Nuttterballl,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:00 2015 UTC,"So your starters are:  QB: Luck RB: Lynch, Lacy, Jennings WR: Julio, Hawkins, Stevie Johnson TE: Dwayne Allen  Benjamin for the 1.03 is a steal imo. I don't think Clay will be very good so getting rid of him is a plus. Reggie Wayne is almost 40. I see no value in keeping him on a roster. Even if he signs with a team like New England or Denver, I just don't see him being relevant.  That said, you need WR help bad. At the 1.03 I would take Cooper/White. At 1.07, I would take Parker/Agholor. You could also try trading the 2 firsts for an upgrade at WR. I think worst case scenario would be taking Gordon at 1.03 and Yeldon at 1.07. It lets you get rid of guys like Gerhart, Riddick, and Smith while setting you up to replace Lynch."
DynastyFF,3e2i3y,username02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:44 2015 UTC,I would have possibly done it if you could guarantee getting Cooper at 1.3 which is unlikely. Looks like you can compete this year and the next couple but since it's a 10 team I can imagine that there are some other pretty good teams

DynastyFF,3e0ois,cardsfan1343,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:46 2015 UTC,You're under the impression he'll be 4th or 5th on the depth chart but you'd be surprised if he is?
DynastyFF,3e0ois,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:58:15 2015 UTC,"No, I was under the impression he was 4th, maybe 5th on the depth chart, with the hunter issue you can do the math and that moves him up to 3rd, maybe 4th"

DynastyFF,3e0kb8,darkforce547,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:21 2015 UTC,"McBride's chances are pretty much the same.  It's not as though Hunter was an impermeable fixture of the Titans offense - there was a lot of hype last off season that he would break out in year 2 and it just didn't happen.  He was already trending dangerously close to being irrelevant.  I took McBride because I thought he had sufficient upside and could easily win a role in Tennessee just by being their best option, not as the default beneficiary of stabbings. I expected him to rise above Hunter on merit."
DynastyFF,3e0kb8,peckx063,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"Talent scouts like Matt Waldman love Tre McBride. He doesn't have the measurables of the high-end guys, but I'm reading great things about McBride all over. Hunter hasn't done what we hoped he would do, but losing him to a suspension means that the new guys are going to have to step up that much sooner and quicker. We'll find out what DGB and McBride can do right away."
DynastyFF,3e0kb8,slodanslodan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"McBride ' s measurables aren't elite, but they're above average for an NFL receiver. He has average height, good weight, good speed, good agility, but his problem is gaining separation.   If he learns to do that he can be a versatile and valuable NFL receiver.  I think all it depends on how well he can improve his footwork.  Im.not expecting much from him this year at all.  I think if he can get a specialist to help him train his feet and use his physique at an NFL level, he will ""break out."""
DynastyFF,3e0kb8,chkessle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"The guy it really helps is Harry Douglas.  He was going to be the backup - of- all trades out there in Tenn.  Now I believe he becomes the #3 WR behind Nicks and Wright.    I'm still not expecting much from him this year with Mariota running for his life, but he may be worth a spot start as a WR4/5 or something. Especially if Nicks is still slowed by his injury/ies."

DynastyFF,3e0mr4,JoshNipples,4,Tue Jul 21 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"Instead of cutting anyone you should try to trade for future picks or pair a couple for one player to try and reduce your roster size. Besides Charles Sims (who even has some value) I don't see anyone who you could just be giving up to free agency. I also think that you can sell Davante Adams and ARob really high right now. Their hype train is rolling. Maybe go and get Luck or Rodgers with all that future talent at WR.   On the draft side, I would go White/Gordon. Really I think Parker, Agholor and Yeldon in my opinion could fall into that tier, but I'm higher on White/Gordon. Maybe Gordon/Yeldon isn't terrible since you'll be loaded at two prime positions. Another option, I think you are weakest at QB so maybe trade down a couple spots with 1.04, grab a future second or third and draft Winston."
DynastyFF,3e0mr4,mweiner422,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:03 2015 UTC,I would package your picks and one of your players for Andrew Luck. QB is the only thing holding you back at this point.
DynastyFF,3e0mr4,dlefty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:11 2015 UTC,"What kind of offers are you sending out for the 1.01 that are not being accepted or countered? To be honest, you clearly know what direction to go, so the only holdup could be if you're either lowballing him like crazy or his counters have been ludicrous.  Otherwise, like /u/dlefty suggested, QB is the only position you can say isn't good enough."

Really like Dwayne Allen or Maxx Williams in the tenth we will see though!"
DynastyFF,3e1145,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of your RBs, but that's probably a style preference rather than a mistake on your part. You should be pretty well-prepared for an immediate run at a championship with that group to supplement your stellar WR corps and a mid-tier QB1.  Well done so far. I would caution against taking a second QB so early though; you can probably wait a lot longer than you think you can and still end up with a serviceable backup. Also, I'd recommend you focus less on filling out your starting lineup (by forcing TE) and more at grabbing best player available from here on out. You already have a killer starting lineup."
DynastyFF,3e1145,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah usually I go for RBs first but where I was in the draft and it seems like RBs are fairly weak this year I went with WRs first 2 picks. I agree my RBs are weak, I definitely went boom or bust with them. The only reason I want to get a couple more QBs is strictly for their trade value. As far as tight end goes, I wanted to get a young starting tight end while I could but at this point it seems like most of the TEs available will produce pretty much the same. So I will weight my options when my pick comes around."
DynastyFF,3e0z46,GotSomeOliveInYaSkin,4,Tue Jul 21 02:59:53 2015 UTC,"It's too late now, but I hate your 2nd Lacy trade.

All you can really do is offer up anyone on your roster for picks and see what offers you get, there's really not a lot to work with"
DynastyFF,3e0z46,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't even bother to counter because I thought it was quite a good trade, especially in comparison to what I paid for him.  Interesting that you say that.  Wonder how others feel."

Vereen might be useful in ppr, but he'll be lucky to crack top 20 rb and hes not young.  Lacy is a top 3 Dynasty RB, should have looked for a better wr and/or a high first rounder at least."
DynastyFF,3e0z46,Vacar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:38 2015 UTC,Looks like yours was the popular opinion.  Smart move would have been to counter regardless.  It's only my 4th trade and I'm the new guy.  Gotta be more aggressive I guess.
DynastyFF,3e0z46,gibbsftw,3,Tue Jul 21 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"1st trade was great! 1.02 + Wallace for Lacy is a steal. The 2nd trade was a mistake. A late first, Adams (a late first), a late second, and Vereen (a late second) is worth less than Lacy.  Newton, Adams, and Landry are the guys you want to build around here. I'd move Royal, Smith, Bowe, Paul, Vereen, and Bradford for whatever you can get. At this point in the season you don't need your defenses. I'd load up on talent at the RB and WR level in the rookie draft.  Who are some of the available free agents left? Those picks might be more valuable than they appear. I'd just go BPA with all your picks because your team is really weak everywhere except QB."
DynastyFF,3e0z46,peckx063,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:40 2015 UTC,I changed the original post to include FAs and my previous trades.  I like the way that you specified perceived value for the guys I got.  I should have pushed him for his first rounder next year in addition to these picks.
DynastyFF,3e0z46,doodwhersmycar,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:11 2015 UTC,"You solid Lacy for about .50c on the dollar.  He's a top 5 RB for the foreseeable future.  Who were these ""useless"" players you dropped?  Cause you kept Bowe for some reason.  Can you post a link to the players available as FAs?  In a 16 team league I would have to guess those later picks (35, 37) aren't worth a whole lot.  If you can bundle a few and move up, I definitely would.  All in all, you aren't THAT bad off for a 16 team league.  Newton, Vereen, Landry, and Johnson are solid guys to build around.  Smith is a solid WR2 for at least this year, especially considering the news that Perriman has some problems.  If your #11 and #18 picks net solid guys, you're looking pretty good.  On more pick in the top 20-24 would help a lot too.  Good luck."
DynastyFF,3e0uhk,JJkling23,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:35 2015 UTC,"Deal seems fairish to a slight overpay. Following 3 firsts for a stud rule would suggest you are giving up too much.  However, AB is  tier 1 elite.  So, I could go 4 firsts and feel good about it.  However, I generally count the first rookie pick as 2.  Try to keep the 6th and then I feel like you are making a good move."
DynastyFF,3e0qwu,Therealcodyg,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:18 2015 UTC,Not even remotely close. You'd have to give up Hill and another asset. Not even sure if Hill and Crowell or Hill and Ingram gets it done.
DynastyFF,3e0qwu,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I wouldn't think the guy would give up Amari Cooper/Todd Gurley for Ingram and Crowell."
DynastyFF,3e0qwu,Qhewjayy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thread title really should have read ""Looking to trade RB(s) for the 1.01"", as I'm definitely open to trading any of my RBs."

DynastyFF,3e0qwu,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"Still probably not enough, but it's getting closer. I think you're setting your sights too high, to be honest.

DynastyFF,3e0qwu,teschmj22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"First, thanks for the response. Agreed on overvaluation. Although, he's really hurting at RB with Forsett/SJax/Stacy/Gerhart/Ball/Asiata/Denard.   I suppose he could grab Gurley/Gordon with 1.01 though, but his depth would still be atrocious in my opinion.   There has to be a way to cash in on this position of strength, no?"
DynastyFF,3e0qwu,bconbucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"There is, but I think you have to go the other direction. I would be trying to sell off one of your fungible RBs for a back-end first round pick and a prospect, or a first and a second rounder.  You still trade off your excess asset, and you still do it at a positive value, but you actually get a deal done that way instead of sending offers that can't add up quite right."
DynastyFF,3dyql8,captainjack64,3,Mon Jul 20 16:55:49 2015 UTC,Like all rookie TE's he struggled a bit last season. The talent is there and he should make a nice leap in year two. That said with Geno at QB all pass catchers have a fairly low ceiling. Id rate him as an acceptable TE2 for 2015
DynastyFF,3dyql8,chiefst,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"Amaro racked up 106 catches for 1,352 yards in his final year at Texas Tech.  Rex Ryan has a habit of gathering ""air it out"" talent just to run the ball, so Amaro ended his rookie campaign with 38 catches for 345 yards.  Chan Gailey is the offensive mastermind that made CJ Spiller run up draft boards after his 2012 season by getting him in space.  That is what Gailey does with players, and that seems to be what Amaro excels in doing.  There are a lot of mouths to feed in New York now with addition of Brandon Marshall, so temper expectations, but a top 10 finish is not out of the question. I'd say a mid level TE2 is more realistic though."
DynastyFF,3dyql8,bplush,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"I am one of those guys who has high hopes for amaro and picked him up in the rookie draft last year as a project player. I am a little more down on him then I was going into last year. I know TE's usually take a couple years to settle in, but (from the limited amount of games I watched of him last year, probably 4-5) he just seems lost on the field, he was slower then expected, and his hands were very unreliable. Doesnt help that he was in a poor offense with a very inconsistent QB.   I think this year will be very telling for his future. I dont expect big numbers but i do expect improvements in all aspects of his game. He has a new OC with a new spread offense and should get him some new looks. Then again thats a whole new offense he has to learn, so he might have some growing pains again. The hands are something he must improve on though. The speed should get better once he gets comfortable and settled in. The QB situation is probably going to be an issue for a couple years. I think at most he could be a greg olsen type player. not the fastest but could be very productive. with a couple strong years."
DynastyFF,3dyql8,OP85,2,Mon Jul 20 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"He's been vocal about not agreeing with Rex's coaching last season and he was not familiar with his system at all, which could have been the reason he looked so lost. This year he's in a very similar system to the one he learned in college and he's mentioned that he's taking to the new coaches more than last year. I think he'll take a step forward, but not a huge one."
DynastyFF,3dyql8,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"yea, Olsen is what I'm hoping and he's pretty consistently a top TE, so that's not a bad thing."
DynastyFF,3dyql8,sg3751,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:31 2015 UTC,Another question I'd add to this: around what pick is he worth? I think it's somewhere between a 3rd and 5th but I'm really not sure.
DynastyFF,3dyql8,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:28 2015 UTC,As an Amaro owner I would rather see what he does this year than sell him for a 3rd unless it was to target a specific prospect I really liked
DynastyFF,3dyql8,PHV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"I read an article about his hands being pretty shaky, which worried me.  Also with Devin Smith there now that could make 3 viable WR options with a below average QB, not a very good recipe for TE success.  I sold him for a 3rd and drafted Clive Walford, a guy who is roughly the same athlete (although he looks more athletic than his combine numbers) and has better hands (10 inch mitts) and less competition for targets."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,gibbsftw,3,Tue Jul 21 01:24:14 2015 UTC,"Not enough for me. I'd want a 2016 1st added on that to feel comfortable making that trade.  On the field Bell's a beast, but even in the offseason he's got the toughest work ethic for a player I've ever seen. Think Jerome Harrison. He's one of a few players that I only feel comfortable moving for 4 1sts... even if one of them is high.  If the 1.12 was changed to a guy like Landry, Adams, Tate, it'd be a step in the right direction. I just have a tough time justifying moving a premier top-5 pick for Cooper/Gurley and two late-1st fliers."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,Vacar,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed that adding a 2016 first would definitely make this easier to stomach. Really feels like it's missing something."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,quickonthedrawl,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"I find it really tough to move any of the top-10ish picks for anything less than a high-1st, along with some established 2nd year talent. It's just so risky trading a stud for 3 rookies."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,Vacar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  If you were trading Bell away, would you rather have this deal or one of the top 3-4 WRs straight up instead?"
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,Vacar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'd trade Bell for OBJ, Bryant, and Brown straight up. I would need something small added onto Julio, Evans, or Green.  All of those players straight up would be better than this deal. I will admit that this trade you were offered is sort of growing on me. Cooper, DGB, and Coleman doesn't sound too bad."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,Vacar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"Julio owner wants Bell pretty bad too.  How about Bell and 2.02 for Julio and 1.08?  Not sure he'd go for it, but maybe.  ADD: Julio owner has 1.08, 1.11, and 2.01  His roster."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,KTOAU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:11 2015 UTC,"Some people even put Bell in front of Julio so this sounds like a solid trade.  Your team is beyond stacked, jesus that is a nice looking team. It completely comes down to who you like better, but that trade is tilted in your favor."

DynastyFF,3e0nh7,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:45 2015 UTC,"I'd sell him.  Assuming that Amari Cooper goes first you take Todd Gurley. You've replaced an immediate threat with one is going to take a little time to get up to speed but will eventually start over Tre Mason. You are already have two great RBs so it won't hurt to add some future depth here.  With the ninth pick, go with DGB as he should still be on the board. He just got a lucky break with Hunter being arrested.  Twelfth pick I'd just go with best available."
DynastyFF,3e0nh7,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:37:18 2015 UTC,If someone offered you Gurley/DGB/Funchess for Lev Bell you would really take that?
DynastyFF,3dz7aa,Bubmack,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty killer starters. Those top 3 WRs are ridiculous, and DJax will be a great WR4. Hill and one of those guys behind him (maybe Blount) will be a totally fine starting two RBs. Brees will almost certainly be a top 10 QB for at least another 2 years. Your TE is a little light, but almost everyone's will be outside the top 4-5 guys. All in all, very very successful.   Ideas for improvements: flipping one of your top 3 WRs for something like a young WR, young RB, and/or picks, could be great. Maybe something like Jordan Matthews, Latavius Murray, and a 2016 1st+2nd? Matthews and CJ Anderson? Not sure, but those are the kind of moves that could both improve your depth and improve your weekly scoring, as long as the guys you trade for live up to their billing. No reason to push too hard for this, though, as even if you stand pat with your roster, you should definitely be in contention this year."
DynastyFF,3dz7aa,blardorg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:27 2015 UTC,Thank You for the advice.  DJAX in the 10th round was a steal.  I felt like that locked up my Flex position pretty well.
DynastyFF,3dz7aa,joemealhouse,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:43 2015 UTC,I think you could probably stand to flip some of your depth at QB for a little more safety at RB for the near future. I'd probably look to move Brees and Sims for the best RB I could get (probably not great but start-able) and roll with and Eli as an every week starter vs being an injury away from a Blount/Ivory started RB combo.
DynastyFF,3dyqau,gamerglory,4,Mon Jul 20 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"I think you have a great chance of competing this year. You have arguably the best QB, you have one RB1 and a good RB2, a great WR in evans along with a low end 1, high end 2 in Hopkins and two more WR2s in cooks and Matthews. TE is gonna be a weak spot for most teams so I wouldn't worry too much about it."

DynastyFF,3dyqau,Brandnewbaseboards,3,Mon Jul 20 17:23:22 2015 UTC,Really depends who's left. Some of my favorite stash and hope rookies are Smelter and Rawls off the top of my head
DynastyFF,3dyqau,MrLinderman,4,Mon Jul 20 19:19:21 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of Mike Tannehill. Best Dolphins QB since David Marino.
DynastyFF,3dyqau,MrLinderman,4,Mon Jul 20 17:04:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. I bought into his hype on here and /r/fantasy football and I think I'm pretty set at QB for a long time.

DynastyFF,3dyqau,Wetzilla,4,Mon Jul 20 17:13:02 2015 UTC,lol whoops his names not Mike! Big whoosh on my part.
DynastyFF,3dyqau,Wetzilla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:13 2015 UTC,Dan's name not David either. Lol :)
DynastyFF,3dyqau,Wetzilla,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:02 2015 UTC,"I think you could be competitive this year. A starting lineup of Rodgers, Tannehill (his first name is Ryan, btw), Hill, Forsett, Randle Evans, Hopkins, Cooks, Matthews, Allen and Ebron is pretty solid. I'd probably look at getting some more RB and TE depth, though I bet at this point most of the TEs left aren't really going to contribute too much."
DynastyFF,3dyqau,ThadCastleWasTaken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:00 2015 UTC,Thanks man!  wanna throw a few names my way?  For TEs I was looking at Heath Miller and Jermaine Gresham and I have no idea for RBs.
DynastyFF,3dyqau,xlShadylx,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really like either of those TEs, though Miller might have an OK year. Who else is left for RBs and TEs?"
DynastyFF,3dyqau,chkessle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"TE is pretty slim pickings since its also a 2TE league.  Not sure there are even any TE's that are still starting. We've got Tim Wright, Marcedes Lewis, Scott Chandler, Luke Willson, Clay Harbor, Anthony Fasano, Andrew Quarless, Gavin Escobar, Lance Kendricks, Cooper Helfet, Brent Celek.  A real whos who of TEs.  For RB's theres Helu, DeAngelo Williams, Cadet, Asiata, Hillman, S. Jackson, Jonas Gray, Branden Oliver, Zac Stacy, Terrance West, T. Rich, Denard Robinson, Alfred Blue, Bobby Rainey, Montee Ball, Knowshon Moreno.  Again, a real who's who of RB."
DynastyFF,3dyqau,blardorg,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"I might take a flier on Tim Wright, Escobar, or Chandler, but they're all longshots to work out.   For RBs, I'd definitely try and get Helu. He's a pretty good running back and really nice receiver, I think he could have a lot of value on the Raiders. I know everyone is all over Latavius Murray, but we have a really small sample size for him, and the Raiders are going to be playing from behind a lot. Helu might end up being more productive in PPR than Murray.   After him it's kind of a crap shoot. Williams is probably only going to have value for the first couple of games, I'd probably pass on him. Cadet might have value, he's going to be battling James White for the Vereen role on the Patriots. If you could get both of them that might not be a bad strategy. I also like Gray, but the lead ""big back"" role is definitely going to Blount this year, so unless he drops off it might be a year or two before Gray pays off. Stacy is still a decent running back, but he went to a pretty crowded backfield on the Jets. West actually looked decent down the stretch last year, but the drafting of Duke Johnson really hurts his outlook.  Denard Robinson is probably never going to be a feature back in the NFL, but he can probably carve out a role for himself somewhere. He'll never be anything more than a dicey flex, but will put up some big games. Oliver is definitely behind Gordon, but there is always the chance that Gordon just doesn't transition to the NFL very well, and Oliver didn't ok last year when given the opportunity. I think you can pretty much ignore all the other RBs you listed.  I'd probably rank the RBs Helu, Stacy, West, Robinson, Gray, Oliver, Cadet (though I'd move Cadet up to probably after West if you can get both Cadet and White)"
DynastyFF,3dyqau,chkessle,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:23 2015 UTC,I think you should just take best player available and not worry about team needs with where your team is at.  I have to imagine you're poised to be one of the more competitive teams in the league so having a bench with potential only makes your team better.  If you find yourself in a solid position to win this year look into Delanie Walker or Owen Daniels as short term depth.  From what I've seen so far next year's draft class has a couple highly coveted TE's as well.  Good luck!
DynastyFF,3dyqau,greebytime,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"DeAngelo - should be good for 4 games while Bell is suspended.  Helu - could get some action, especially if Latavius was just a flash in the pan.  Stacy... who knows?  New offense, maybe he could return to a somewhat form of his rookie year.  Shoelace - if Yeldon pulls a Gerhart/Sankey; at Least Shoelace has proven he can perform.  Oliver - If Gordon pulls a Sankey.. same deal."
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,madeapizza,2,Mon Jul 20 12:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is a fair trade without the 2016 third rounder, especially since y'all only start two DEs per week. I wouldn't pay that for Murray since I've got a lower opinion of him than consensus, but it's about right for market value."
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:23 2015 UTC,I would rather have Cooper/Gurley + Yeldon/Agholor/Parker than L. Murray and Hardy.
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,username02,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:36 2015 UTC,I think you misread the trade  It's 1.08 + Future 3rd for Murray + Hardy
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,Dr_Lollygag,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:14 2015 UTC,I didn't misread the trade.  He has the 1.02 and the 1.08. He needs help at WR and RB. Giving up the 1.08 for Murray and Hardy doesn't strike me as a good trade.  I would rather keep the 1.08. Draft Cooper/Gurley at 1.02 then Yeldon/Parker/Agholor at 1.08
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,username02,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"Got it. It sort of sounded as if you were including his 1.02 in the trade by saying you'd prefer Cooper + 1.08 to Murray + Hardy, when that seems to be obvious."
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just kind of left off the whole first half of my response lol"
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,username02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:24 2015 UTC,Do you think I have a realistic chance at those three at 1.08? I would love to get Parker.
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,username02,0,Mon Jul 20 14:13:46 2015 UTC,It's entirely possible. Parker's surgery has scared some people off. He could fall.  You could also use the 1.08 to move up if to 1.05/6 to get him if he is there. It should really only cost you a 2nd or a 3rd to do it.
DynastyFF,3dxvsr,blardorg,3,Mon Jul 20 14:16:41 2015 UTC,Yup that's it. I would be giving up 1.08 and a future third for Murray and Hardy.
DynastyFF,3dybet,craigliterate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:06:43 2015 UTC,"How did you get bell AND brown at 9/11?  that jumps off the page right away.    I like the RB core that you have, just don't be shy about playing waivers for any of your guys after DMC since they're a hodge podge and you should constantly be looking to swap for 2015's forsetts and andersons.  Your WR corp is in good shape.  It's always nice to have two guys with a current track record of legit production but the grouping of cooper/parker/landry is solid.  YOu might look to swap someone like Austin for a WR4 with past production (eddie royal, etc.).  That could give you something definite to fall back on in case the other three just fail to produce this year.  I would do the same around QB.  If Brees' production dips, the guys you have could leave you weak at the position.  You're solid everywhere else and I like your chances to compete for the whole enchilada this year."
DynastyFF,3dybet,quixoticFOX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have no idea how I got them both. Rodgers, luck, Dez, Calvin, AD, Lacy, Julio and odb all went before brown at 9 and i had some real internal struggle between brown and bell but after going with brown the kid at 10 went with shady and aj green which I was absolutely stoked about."
DynastyFF,3dybet,HighMakkaMakka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:13 2015 UTC,10 team leagues are so alien to me because their rosters all look superb. I don't care for Run DMC and Williams in your RB pool though.
DynastyFF,3dybet,Wetzilla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:40 2015 UTC,Williams was probably a late round pick to cover for the games Bell misses this year.
DynastyFF,3dybet,frahmer86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I got Williams as leveon insurance and dmc I got in a crazy late round so I figured may as well roll the dice
DynastyFF,3dybet,dhgodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:10 2015 UTC,"You should see my 8-team league. I'm starting a 10-teamer this year, so I'm expanding the starting lineups, which usually helps."
DynastyFF,3dybet,dhgodo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'd feel good about this draft. Nabbing Bell AND Brown at #9 is shocking, but believable given my experiences with some peoples' draft strategies.   QB: Solid guys that will keep you in the middle of the pack.   RB: Bell and Lynch as your core is nice. Jennings is solid as long as he stays healthy. I'd sell high on McFadden when he has a large game (inevitable this year behind Dallas's O-line).  WR: So damn tasty.  TE: I believe Kelce will be a top 5 TE play for the next several years.   Def: Just play match-ups for the win.  I think you're set up for a year 1 and 2 win. After that, I think, it depends on how you handle upgrading your QB's and second RB (Lynch). You're set at WR for several years. Great job overall, though!"
DynastyFF,3dybet,sg3751,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detail! Yeah I was thinking similar things about dmc. Hoping for a bounce back year for Brees. I wanted him to be my first dynasty QB because of all the fucking havoc he wreaked for me from like 09-11. He will always have a place in my heart (and bench)
DynastyFF,3dyqt2,treyduuce,3,Mon Jul 20 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"4th round pick doesn't have much value, but Bryce Brown and Steven Jackson probably have even less. It must be a pretty big league if Jackson is even on a roster."

DynastyFF,3dyqt2,chiefst,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:22 2015 UTC,So someone is welcoming you to the league by offering two turds to stink up your bench? Not cool.

DynastyFF,3dzmcm,FaceSmashers,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:47 2015 UTC,probably need to see the rest of your team but especially the IDP scoring settings.   is it a sack heavy league?
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,Btk88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:32 2015 UTC,Sacks are 3.5 (plus 1 point for the tackle)
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,Btk88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"personally i wouldn't do it, i think what you already have is greater then what you will gain. not just for this year but future years  Luck and Watt are close to a tie but i'd favour luck   at this point unless I already have forte and think i can compete i'm leaving him alone. I give the edge to Abdullah  your first for Dobson and a third, no way   so Mosley is like a freebie ."
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,Therealcodyg,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"Taco?   Seriously, I may be missing something here, but this is horrible for you."
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"The reason I think this trade is reasonable is because of the positional differences. Watt is WAY better than all the other D-linemen, while Luck is only marginally better than Matt Ryan (on my bench)  What about it makes you say it is horrible?"
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,Therealcodyg,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on scoring. You're giving up Luck, who's arguably the best QB in the league. You're giving up a promising RB. Also a high-end LB and a 1st round pick.  You get the best defender in the game, a RB who is in the twilight of his career (especially bad for you in dynasty format), an inconsequential WR, and a 3rd round pick.  Luck = Watt  Abdullah > Forte (in the long term)  Mosley> Dobson  1st > 3rd"
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:51 2015 UTC,Word. I hear what you're saying. The way I left the trade talks was that I was going to see how I'm standing in Week 5 or 6 and if I want to try to make a push for a championship as this trade would definitely help my 2015 squad.   Thanks for the feedback.
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,PaoloPWD,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:56 2015 UTC,I think that's probably a good plan. You'll have a fair idea of where Ameer and Forte stand by that time as well.
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,username02,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"Since you already have another QB why dont you try to rework the trade so you dont have to give up so much, Luck + a 2016 3rd for Watt"
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,username02,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:28 2015 UTC,From my limited knowledge of IDP I know that Watt is a first round  ish?startup normally. So for what it is worth I would say maybe: Watt = Luck Forte = 2016 1st Ameer Abdullah is a late first/early second > 2016 3rd Cj Mosley > Aaron Dobson. So i don't think you should do it.
DynastyFF,3dzmcm,detphi1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in my league it's hard to see outside of my gilded cage.   That's why I put it on here.
DynastyFF,3dyi4s,badassmother4000,4,Mon Jul 20 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"Id do it. I trust Gordon more than Hyde at this point with the uncertainty of the Niners. Martavis and Parker go hand in hand so they offset eachother.   Overall its a very fair trade, I just feel Gordon gives you more security"
DynastyFF,3dyi4s,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like a fair deal to me. What do you other RBs look like? Bryant vs Brown is  toss-up for me. I feel like Brown will be more consistent, but Bryant's TDs lead him to higher upside. So if you're deep add Bryant, but if you're looking for depth add Brown.  Between Stills or Strong I'd go Strong."
DynastyFF,3dyi4s,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"It's not a super badass crew - pretty much in punt mode after startup, and the only other RB I got is Duke Johnson. Sammy Watkins is my other WR. Thanks for the the bonus round answer as well - here's an internet baked good."
DynastyFF,3dyi4s,GuamSD,2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:59 2015 UTC,Do it. Big factor is Chargers spent free agency beefing up their OL while Niners lost two starters.
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,LUCIFERx88,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"Your team is the epitome of ""Win Now"" and with KC's last two games of the year being at home against Cleavland and Oakland I would think twice before trading away the KC backfield.    Full disclosure:  With Jordy and now Adams competing for attention from Rogers I am lower than most on Cobb.    If you are in love with WRs under 27 why don't you go after A Robinson, Cooks, Evans, or Watkins?  They are all younger than Cobb and might be able to be had for cheaper."
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,bfro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"I agree it might be a bit much but I'm worried a little about Charles after last year. I personally think Adams takes over Jordy's role in 2 years, I think Cobb's role is pretty set. I would like to win this year, but I also try to keep the following 3 years in mind. I agree it probably is an overpay if I do it though."
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:57 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified in the OP that I'm love more proven guys under 27 (AJ, Dez, Julio, OBJ, Evans, Cobb, DT, Alshon). I understand it is little more expensive than a Watkins or Hopkins but to me it matters if you have proven it before, because while Watkins and Hopkins are nice we never know for a fact if they can take that next step. Also you are still paying almost as much for them as the guys I mentioned above."
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,RoyVelcro,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:27 2015 UTC,"""I'm in love with the top 8 WRs in football""  How odd"
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,xlShadylx,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:40 2015 UTC,That seems like way too much for Cobb. Honestly I would just start with Jamaal/Davis and add to the deal until he accepts starting with the draft picks.
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,xlShadylx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:41 2015 UTC,Well I'd be giving Jamaal/Davis to the contender who would give picks to this other owner who has Cobb and I can't imagine he'd give up 3 2016 1sts for Charles/Davis. I'm pretty sure I'll have to chip in a bit more.
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,xlShadylx,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:30 2015 UTC,What is the Cobb owner getting at the end of this trade?
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:19 2015 UTC,3 2016 1sts
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:16 2015 UTC,Trade Knile and Jamaal to another owner for two 1sts and a 2nd?
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,PaoloPWD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I approached the Cobb owner about Charles/Davis, Bmarsh and my 2017 1st for Cobb and he said that he'd rather have 3 1sts and preferably 2016 and there is only one owner who has that. I'd give that owner Charles/Davis BMarsh and 2017 1st and he would then give those 3 2016 1sts to the Cobb owner. Unfortunately this 3 way is the only way to get it done. That being said is it worth it or too much an overpay?"
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,camomilk,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:57 2015 UTC,I'm saying try to trade the RBs to another team (not involved in the trade) for two 1sts and a 2nd.  Then you can turn around and trade three 1sts for Cobb and you'd have an extra 2nd and get to keep BMarsh.
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,camomilk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, yeah that's not a bad idea."
DynastyFF,3dzcfi,gcortese04,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:27 2015 UTC,I feel like this has to be an overpay. I hope out works out for you.

DynastyFF,3dyfow,cmp343,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"I would do this pretty quick in a 1QB league. Rolling from vet QB to vet QB totally works in 1QB. Ingram will get you a few very good weeks at minimum and if he makes the whole year, even better."
DynastyFF,3dyfow,Sticky_Z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a 1QB league, Teddy's value is not too near Ingram. DLF has Ingram ~20 picks ahead of Teddy, and given you have Brees and Kaep, you should be happy to make that swap even if Bridgewater was slightly more valuable than Ingram. I'd trade any one of your QBs for almost any startable W/R/T (say like top 20 RB, top 30 WR, top 6 TE)."
DynastyFF,3dyfow,blardorg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:21 2015 UTC,I would do this if you think it will put in you in a good spot to win this year.  Your RB depth is weak but what about the rest of your team? Your league's scoring system would help also.
DynastyFF,3dyfow,klassicd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:40 2015 UTC,I would do this if it is a start one QB league. You need the RB help more than QB help.
DynastyFF,3dyfow,Buxxtin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:45 2015 UTC,You do need RB help but Mark Ingram for Teddy is not close in value imo. I'd keep Bridgewater over Kaep as well. I would probably put both Kaep and Teddy on the trade block and see if there are better offers than Ingram.

If this were say, Foster and Blue (Houston was another run heavy team) this same logic doesn't apply.  In fact, I think KC might be the only team that it would be worth trading for both the lead back and the handcuff."
DynastyFF,3dyf9q,username02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that Andy Reid throttled-back Charles' carries last year because of his huge load in 2013. He was also dealing with a minor injury. If (1) you want to unload Charles this year and (2) you're okay with waiting, you could bait more value by waiting until he has a massive game or two then quickly sell. I personally believe he will bounce back in a large way this year. [As a Charles owner] When he does, I'll ride him through a few match-ups then see where his value lies."

DynastyFF,3dyf9q,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:50 2015 UTC,I think that's a little high.  Charles is going behind gurley and cooper in startup drafts.  Sometimes behind Gordon and white.  I'd value him around 1.3-1.4

QBs nowadays are thrown into the fire way too quickly. The Jets have 2 solid WRs in BMarsh and Decker with promising guys like Amaro and Smith. Taylor, if he starts, may do a little better at first because of his rushing, but I find it hard to trust a Roman offense with Rex as HC long term. Granted Geno is hard to trust long term as well but he was a decent prospect coming from WVU and I'd have to take him over Tyrod by a small bit."

DynastyFF,3dz3p8,Hawxfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"I bet you could turn Owen Daniels, Joseph Randle, and Vincent Jackson into one decent young WR like Keenan Allen or maybe more."
DynastyFF,3dz3p8,Hawxfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:31 2015 UTC,That's not a bad thought. I think Daniel's and Randle's value will increase in the season. But I will look to shop them around.
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,captainjack64,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty good lineup that should keep you competitive for this year, and you have anice base for the future. Your biggest needs are at starting RB and WR depth. Id try to trade Mathews to the Murray owner and try to get good value."
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I have the 1st pick in the rookie draft and am probably gonna take Amari. That should help with the WR depth. Then I can focus on my RB need.
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:24 2015 UTC,+1 Really like this idea. Usually you can get better value from the handcuff owner as they view it a bit like an insurance premium.
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,stewwy35,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"honestly.... blow it up. you have a large mix of players ranging from very old to some very young.  You can be competitive this year but would need lots of luck to win it all.  If I was in this situation I would sell Foster, Martin, Matthews, Asiata, Jennings, Smith SRr, and Olsen.   Drop 1 Defense work on WRs first meaning take Amari at 1.01 and at 2.01 if you still have it go for jaelen strong or another WR there too.  After you have at least 4 WRs you would start weekly then you can go to building RB. by the time you have completed both of those tasks if you still have tannehill and Amaro/Donnell you will be ready to win it all."
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,Bubmack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like Steve Smith is my only old guy. My starting lineup would be:  QB- Tannehill  RB- Foster, Martin  WR- Antonio brown, cobb  TE- Olsen  Flex- Bryant, Amari Cooper  D- Jets  K- Barth  Do you not think that team is solid? I feel it might be a bit too soon to blow it up."
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,stewwy35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:48 2015 UTC,Foster and Olsen are past prime
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,stewwy35,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:11 2015 UTC,Maybe. I'm willing to give them 1 more year after they were both top 5 for their position last year.
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,dlefty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"foster is definitely old, bryant is inconsistent and due for a drop this season. cooper is young he will be a stud though.  Olsen is pretty old im pretty sure as well."
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,Bubmack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:22:30 2015 UTC,"Foster is the same age as Jamaal Charles (28) and Olsen just turned 30, coming off his best ever season."
DynastyFF,3dy7dd,dlefty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:39:52 2015 UTC,so yeah foster is still old and olsen is old too. im just saying I dont think you can win the championship with this squad. trying to continue to build from here will be a longer process than tossing away over 25 players and using those players to get more future picks and investments.
DynastyFF,3dz2jy,joemealhouse,3,Mon Jul 20 18:18:47 2015 UTC,The AROB side by a landslide. Andre Williams is not worth nearly that much. excellent deal
DynastyFF,3dz2jy,CheckedCoffee05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"Glad to get some positive feedback, thought the gap between White & Perriman wasn't as sizable as some of the rankings might have it (especially the next 3 years) but the gap between Robinson and Williams was significant the life of their contracts."
DynastyFF,3dz2jy,Sticky_Z,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:56 2015 UTC,For 3.75$ less give me Arob side all day! thats a steal...i think

DynastyFF,3dy5rb,captainjack64,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:33 2015 UTC,I'd say he's worth a mid/lateish 2nd and thays because Im not too high on him annd the fact that PFM isnt getting any younger
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:47 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. The 2.08 pick could be a possibility.
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,mooustached_walrus,4,Mon Jul 20 14:57:58 2015 UTC,I think Latimer's is more valuable than any player you'd be considering at 2.8.
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,Wetzilla,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think Latimer's value is actually that high right now, like /u/onlymycouchpullsout he's probably worth at most a mid to late 2nd. His potential is way higher than that, if he becomes what a lot of people think he will be he'll be worth at least a first. the only problem is that you're going to have to hold onto him for at least another year, he's not going to get a ton of work this season without and injury to either Thomas or Sanders. If you can hold onto him I'd recommend it."
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,mooustached_walrus,2,Mon Jul 20 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"As a Latimer owner myself, I would hold him.  His value is probably lower than what you spent to get him, and the potential is still there.    His value will only go up if he sees any playing time, and he should see the field this year.  He's in a similar situation to Adams (high draft pick), but without any love (granted, the GB system is better for a WR3, but he's still stuck behind Jordy and Cobb).  Not every WR can make an immediate impact-last year's class spoiled us."
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,mooustached_walrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:36 2015 UTC,Okay that's fair. The reason I'm curious is because I drafted him 116th and his ADP is now 72nd in startups. Was curious if I should sell now.
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,fishing_wyrm,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"Like others said, his value is definitely at a low (the reason why you were able to get him at 116). A good game or two will really boost his trade value or maybe you'll want to keep him.  We didn't get to see anything from him last year since Fox hates playing rookies."
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:41 2015 UTC,I am hanging on to Latimer and hoping for a big game early to increase his value.
DynastyFF,3dy5rb,urfrendlipiro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be lucky to get a 2nd round pick for him. Even with Peyton, it's hard to warrant any serious consideration to his WR3. It only gets worse without him too. I'm not too high on him, but I would rather Hardy/Smelter (2nd-3rd rounders) to Latimer."
DynastyFF,3dz0rf,TMN09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Never been in a contract league, so I don't know if it makes a difference in trade value, but I wouldn't do this.  Julio is a top 5 dynasty asset (#1 in my eyes) and you could get more for him."
DynastyFF,3dz0rf,xlShadylx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:59 2015 UTC,Would you do Julio for Lacy on the same contract? I'm skeptical on trading Julio as well. I just want to weigh my options
DynastyFF,3dz0rf,xlShadylx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Again, not familiar with contracts, but yeah.. change Hill to Lacy and throw in a first and you've got my attention.  I would still say no, but the value's a lot closer. I'm really high on Julio, though."
DynastyFF,3dyxcc,DeltaT75,9,Mon Jul 20 17:42:39 2015 UTC,Jesus no.
DynastyFF,3dyxcc,LUCIFERx88,5,Mon Jul 20 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"Just for a point of comparison, I plugged that into the Dynasty Trade Calculator by /u/sicknarlo (available on the sidebar!). Evans is worth 2499. Brees and Jackson together are worth 217. Your side of this trade is worth roughly ten times as much as your prospective partner's side.  I'm guessing that having a bunch of people scream about how this is terrible doesn't really help you long term. Here are some things to consider when valuing a player in dynasty, and how it plays into this trade:   Longevity. WRs are considered the kings of dynasty because they have the longest playing careers after QB.  Positional scarcity. Scarcity depends on the number of starters. In a standard league (like yours), WRs are worth more than QBs because you need to start more WRs which increases the scarcity at the WR position. Read about value based drafting if you don't understand positional scarcity. Age. Brees and Jackson are both the twilight of their careers. They are fine players to have on your team, but they won't be part of your team in three years. Mike Evans is 21 years old. He's younger than a lot of rookies after a year of NFL experience. Barring anything unexpected, Evans will produce at a stud level for another 8 years, and will be a useful member of your team for over a decade. Talent. We want players who are good because we've got them for the long haul. Production/Situation. While talent is more important, we also need points. It's important to weight talent vs. situation, but don't overvalue situation."
DynastyFF,3dyxcc,slodanslodan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"To piggy back on this, WRs are probably even more valuable in your league because you have 2 FLEX spots."
DynastyFF,3dyxcc,sicknarlo,4,Mon Jul 20 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"This is like trading a fresh, crisp $100 bill for one of these. Please don't make this trade, and check out the sidebar for links to dynasty rankings.  Your trade partner is trying to screw you over. He/she is trying to ruin you and is taking you for a complete and total fool."
DynastyFF,3dyxcc,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"This was my thought, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something strange here.   Thanks so much! I appreciate it!"

DynastyFF,3dyxcc,LincolnSteve,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"Roethlisberger is barely a step down from Brees at this point and neither is worth giving up Mike Evans. Especially since you have a serviceable low end QB1 already in Stafford.  I would roll with Stafford and try to pick up someone for a lot cheaper with some upside as a backup, but to put things in perspective the only 2 QBs I would consider for Evans would be Luck or Rodgers."

DynastyFF,3dyw9k,vanderbeekmynigga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"Your WR are fairly weak for a 10 team league. Your RB is fine, but I'm not sure it's strong enough to make up the difference at WR.  The good news is you have a few options to choose from. If you can play matchups well and master the waiver wire (very important in a 10 team league) you can make the playoffs."
DynastyFF,3dyw9k,chkessle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"Id disagree on the RB point. I think they're pretty damn strong (top heavy, but still strong), in that you've got probably two top 10 RBs in your starting spots plus Yeldon for the future as well as a couple other guys IF they pan out. I think WR is weak too but at least you've got Hopkins to build with."
DynastyFF,3dyw9k,sg3751,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:32 2015 UTC,"The RB are good. Just not good enough to overcome the lack of a clear cut WR2. Gore can fill one flex for a while, but if he stops producing it's going to be hard to keep up on a weekly basis running Nuk and the WR3/4 of the week."
DynastyFF,3dyw9k,chkessle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"Set at RB and QB for a while. Your WRs are meh and lack any real punch. TE is good for now, but I'd invest in a young guy with promise soon"
DynastyFF,3dysto,areuthless,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"Who ever trades Yeldon for Randle is bat shit crazy. The hype trade is gone way to far, if someone offers you that i'd jump on it pretty quick."
DynastyFF,3dysto,Brad227,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"I'd personally rather have Yeldon. I'm just not sold on Randle being that good, he's never been that great when given over 10 carries a game, most of his good runs came towards the end of games when Murray had already run all over the defense. It would pretty heavily depend on the young WR you'd be getting alongside him."
DynastyFF,3dysto,Wetzilla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:19 2015 UTC,I was gunna try for Davonte Adams
DynastyFF,3dysto,Wetzilla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"From a value perspective Adams and Randle are probably a decent trade for Yeldon, but I really don't like Adams. He struggled in coverage last season, and is going to need an injury to be anything more than an inconsistent WR3 in the next few years. not to mention he's got a couple of talented WRs behind him on the depth chart breathing down his neck. If you can flip him for something good I might take it, but I'd probably just stick with Yeldon."
DynastyFF,3dwboc,captainjack64,6,Mon Jul 20 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"I would still recommend Amari Cooper, for a few reasons:   Even though it is standard scoring, I think he's the safer choice. No lingering injury concerns, no easing into the offense. He'll be the guy from day 1 and should not be a risk to lose much value for 1-2+ years, even if he stinks. Given your team composition, that seems to be what you need. You can almost always trade WRs for RBs at fair value. The same can't always be said in reverse, depending on your league dynamics. You don't just need RBs, you also need WRs. Cooper is a slam dunk WR prospect. Please, for the love of dynasty football, drop one (or both!) of your kickers. Drop one of your D/STs. Grab some lotto tickets at RB and reap the rewards in 2-3 months when the second- and third-stringers start making an impact on game day. If I were you, I'd also be doing everything I could to move either Foles or Osweiler too!"
DynastyFF,3dwboc,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:46 2015 UTC,"After the rookie draft we have a cut day, where I will be cutting a kicker. Sorry, I should have mentioned that."
DynastyFF,3dwboc,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:38 2015 UTC,"Good to hear! For whatever it's worth, there's not a single circumstance where I'd carry two kickers for even a single week (made easier since I own Gostkowski nowhere)."
DynastyFF,3dwboc,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 20 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"Well you have 3 options to me:   Draft Gordon/Gurley Trade back into the first round. Hopefully get something like Yeldon/Agholor  Trade for one. Some people are high on Lattimore, so you could always shop him for a 2nd rd pick."
DynastyFF,3dwboc,m_plis,2,Mon Jul 20 02:09:40 2015 UTC,Lattimore   I'm assuming you mean Cody Latimer
DynastyFF,3dwboc,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:18:13 2015 UTC,Yup. Autocorrect got me.
DynastyFF,3dwboc,brandonfrank04,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:00 2015 UTC,Draft for talent trade for need. If you want to win now and need a win now rb than try and turn that 1.01 and a play or another pick into charles or lynch or Peterson or jery hill or whoever your heart desires. If you're not contending this year than you should be taking bpa and address overall team talent first then when you're ready to contend your trade away youngsters or picks to shore up positional need.  I'm contending traded a some of picks Allen Robinson and Sammy watkins  for Lamar miller latavious Murray Doug Martin and Eddie lacy.
DynastyFF,3dwboc,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"Taking Todd Gurley at 1.01 is the easy choice and it will quickly make your RBs much much better. This is coming from someone who always argues for Cooper at 1.01, but if you really want a RB, Gurley is going to a be a powerhouse."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,klassicd,2,Sun Jul 19 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"Trading Gronk away definitely hurts, but you've got a more young guy oriented team than not with the exception of PFMl Let's analyze this: Gronk is worth about 3 firsts...  I'd say A-Rob and Cooper together are worth just about 3 firsts, with the 2.04 being thrown in as a kicker... it's not a bad offer and it's definitely a fair trade  It's unfair if you go and substitute Hopkins for the 2.04 like someone said on here, but I would probably accept this trade if you substituted A-Rob for Hopkins, or if you threw in a 2nd and he removed his whilst adding Hopkins."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"When you initially saw this offer did you think ""man, that is way too much value for Gronk!""?  Because I didn't, and I really think that is the barometer you should use when talking about trading away a top 5 keeper.    Now I do see the possibility of a deal with this particular team because of how stacked he is at RB and WR, but you would have to ask for a lot more and honestly I think the team could give up a lot more and still come out improved.  First thing I'd do is make him swap QB's.  I'm assuming you want to rebuild, and the only way you're getting anything back for Peyton is part of a bigger deal.  Next thing is get Lamar Miller, because he's 24 and going to be a stud for a while and also because this guy has too many good RB's.  Then he needs to decide if he wants to trade you 1.03 or Sammy Watkins.  Then you have a deal.  If you get an offer of Cam Newton, Lamar Miller, Sammy Watkins for Gronk and Peyton, that is one scenario I see you trading him away."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,mnwildfan79,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:30 2015 UTC,Gronk is one of the funnest players to root for in fantasy. This trade should have at least one more 1st to even consider it.
DynastyFF,3dvukg,chiefst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"It's tough to trade Gronk...especially for kids who haven't played or haven't played much at the NFL level...  If you could get Hopkins instead of the 2nd, maybe if you add a 2nd on your end? I'd do that."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,Cavemansol,2,Sun Jul 19 23:28:55 2015 UTC,I think it'd be pretty hard to convince someone to add a player nearly worth Gronk alone onto Cooper and Robinson.
DynastyFF,3dvukg,Vacar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"If I had your team I would try to trade Peyton before moving gronk. I would need a spectacular trade before even thinking about moving gronk, to me, this deal is a push."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,dlefty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think this is a slam dunk. Cooper has a very real chance to be worth what Gronk is by the end of the season, and Robinson could have a similar chance to be worth much more than he is right now. Also, if you play it right, that 2.04 could give you a productive and valuable player for the future. I would love to land a deal like this one."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do it without having a solid backup TE or a TE being given to me, 'cause you're not going to find one in the rookie draft.  Push for more, or let us know who your backup is."
DynastyFF,3dvukg,Unpossible42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:36:02 2015 UTC,Don't do it.  Gronk might be the most valuable player in fantasy right now (if you can stomach the injury risk)  Having Gronk will give you a huge advantage every week. He's the most elite player at his position and it's not even close. Keep him.
DynastyFF,3dw3e6,detphi1,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"I like Eifert. He's like a big WR that lines up as TE and out wide sometimes. He has good speed and moves and I just feel that he will get a lot of good looks and some red zone work. If you can live with his injury history/potential, he is the unquestioned TE1 on the Bengals."
DynastyFF,3dw3e6,Hawxfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"I say Ebron.  I'm not sure the Bengals are even 100% sold on Eifert.  They drafted Kroft for a reason, right? His injury history scares me."
DynastyFF,3dw3e6,bplush,0,Mon Jul 20 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"Not only did they draft Kroft, but then they went and drafted Uzomah who is really more of a receiving type as well.  Sounds avoidable on all fronts."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,vannawhite_power,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the return points, I strongly prefer Robinson. In just 9 games, Robinson put up 2/3 of the points that Landry got in 15 games, and that's on the 2014 lowest-scoring offense. Robinson was more valuable on a per-game basis, despite playing Landry's PPR advantage in the slot.  With the return yards, I'm guessing raw points evens out or even slightly favors Landry. However, there is no guarantee that Landry keeps returning, whereas I think Robinson's touchdown potential can't go down. In the long term, I think Robinson is the better prospect."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,slodanslodan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you overall, but you can't dismiss the fact that Robinson will still almost certainly be on one of the worst offenses in 2015, while Miami is trending up. Being in Jax puts a cap on Robinson, IMO. He can definitely be a high end WR2, but I'm not sure he'll have the opportunity to be a top 10 WR. (The same is true for Landry, given his role and competition, which is why I still like Robinson more!)"
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,blardorg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I see the situation is a point in Robinson's favor. It's easier to improve from league-worst to average than it is to improve from average to league-leading, so Robinson's situation is more likely to improve than Landry's situation."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,slodanslodan,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"Robinson has a higher ceiling, Landry has a higher floor I think."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,bplush,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"I personally like Landry, he's more athletic than people think and he catches the ball...he only had two drops all year last year.  Also his team is much better than Robinsons. I think Landry will be the next PPR superstar."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,dlefty,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:50 2015 UTC,"I choose Allen Rob purely for upside, but the risk is Bortles sucks. I believe that if he wasn't on the Jags he'd be in the discussion for one the best WRs of last year akin to Odell/Evans  Landry is a safer, boring option (because Tannehill > Bortles) but sometime in the future Parker will be getting the lion's share of targets."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,brucemilus,0,Sun Jul 19 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think Robinson is both the better player right now and the player with much more upside. Robinson has a chance to break into the WR1 crowd with guys like Julio, Dez, AJ, etc. Good size, full route tree, strong seperation skills,  can win virtually any jump ball, not as fast as some other elite WRs from an ""explosiveness"" POV which is really his only limitation.    Landry really doesn't translate as a superstar ever (I much prefer Parker).  I view him as a perennial WR3 type who might produce WR2 numbers if things go his way."
DynastyFF,3dv9z8,peckx063,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"With 1:10 or 1:20 on return yard scoring, I could maybe see an argument for Landry, but this is Robinson for me all day every day.  To everybody dismissing him as hype, or trying to cash in on his hype: I hope you don't cry too much once you've realize how special this kid is!   Forget the advanced metrics that suggest he's a top tier prospect. Forget even the pace he was on while he was a healthy rookie (~WR21 in PPR). Just ask yourself, if he had played an entire 16 game season, what kind of value would you put on him today?  Do you really want to be selling somebody short because their season was truncated? Remember, this is a second year player who is younger than most of the incoming rookies and who already has success against NFL defenders. He was a rookie receiver with a rookie quarterback and still put up numbers.  Sell him at your own risk. :)"
DynastyFF,3dw6ak,Gway22,2,Mon Jul 20 01:09:52 2015 UTC,"I would not do this. Like another comment said, I would remove Cooks and the first and put in ARob and Kelvin. I think this is much better for you and still could possibly land you the trade. I seem to be higher on Cooks than most others, but I cant see myself giving him up plus a first for damn near anything."
DynastyFF,3dw6ak,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think I do this in a vacuum. Cooks is worth a mid-high first (or more), you have another first, and I don't value Forsett or Randle as more than a second rounder a piece. So two firsts and two seconds for Leveon Bell? I give that up for him every time. I would rather give up Kelvin Benjamin or Allen Robinson (or both, and take out the future first) than Cooks though. I think his potential is sky high right now, and you would be selling low on him. That being said, you'd still be getting arguably the top dynasty RB in return, so it's probably still worth it if you can't sub a different WR."

WR: Listed in post.  TE:Julius Thomas, ASJ, Ebron  So I'm looking good, I'm just looking to see how I can get better."
DynastyFF,3dw6ak,feelitallaround,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would cash in on Benjamin's decent 2014 and Robinson's 2015 hype and offer them up instead of Cooks plus a first. Otherwise I would have to think much harder about this if I were you before pulling the trigger. You have a good team without getting Leveon. I would cash in on your RB and (more importantly) WR depth in order to consolidate startable talent, since I don't think with Evans, Dez and Cooks on your team that Allen Robinson or Kelvin Benjamin make your starting lineup for a long time if at all."
DynastyFF,3dw6ak,Vacar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy yes here.  Forsett (late-2nd), Cooks (early-1st), Randle (mid-2nd), and a 2016 1st for one of a few 3-4 firsts player."
DynastyFF,3dw6ak,doodwhersmycar,2,Mon Jul 20 01:18:15 2015 UTC,Shipped Randle off for a first this offseason. His value appears to be in the eye of the beholder
DynastyFF,3dw6ak,Vacar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:03:57 2015 UTC,Dang! That's insane value.  I have him in one league and can't move him for a 2nd rounder.

DynastyFF,3dw6ak,peckx063,0,Mon Jul 20 11:21:13 2015 UTC,"Who are your other backs? You'd be making a move to win in the next 1-3 seasons and losing Forsett is somewhat counterproductive to that goal. I'd rather give up a 2nd rounder or a rookie prospect and ride Forsett til the legs fall off. Also, you can probably cut Cole Beasley."
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,Wetzilla,6,Sun Jul 19 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"You kidding me?    John Brown and it's not even close.  Hell, I'd have trouble giving up Brown if the deal was flipped and it was DGB and a 2nd."
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,peginus,3,Sun Jul 19 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"I would do this easily, even straight up for Brown even. DGB is on potentially the worst team for fantasy purposes and has a ton of history, being the fact that he hasnt played in a while. The fact that he throws in a 2 as a kicker makes this a very easy accept"
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:31:00 2015 UTC,Question for you: I've been trying to get a sense of rankings for drafting purposes - and I feel like the resources versus what I read on here are completely disparate. I totally agree with John Brown over DGB - but is there somebody on the internet with rankings that line up in that fashion?
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,bastegod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Ooooh good question. For me its hard to say, i usually go by some adp and i'll reach for a few guys if I feel theyre more valuanle than they are. You probably gotta take a look at dlf maybe? Idk. They weigh rookies more favorably than most so it might not be ideal"
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"A couple of the DLF rankers have John Brown over DGB, but most have Brown pretty close to DGB."
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,peckx063,0,Mon Jul 20 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"For the record, DGB is ranked higher by about 10 spots in composite rankings.  I remember our league coveting him as a high school senior and people are going to be slow to give up on a former #1 recruit.  In a world where DGB was a good human he probably would have been a top 10 pick."
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,peginus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"I guess i'd rather just have the WR who's currently living with his starting quarterback, has good character and has already shown that he can produce at a decently high level as a rookie over a rookie on potentially the worst offense in the league who has a metric ton of red flags."
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,peckx063,0,Sun Jul 19 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'd probably want Brown too but DGB has undeniably the higher ceiling  (although Brown isn't without upside) and that's where most of the appeal lies. He's an incredibly risky proposition but if I have my starters locked in and Brown isn't one of them, stashing DGB for a potential value explosion might be worth losing out on Brown.    Also, in a situatuonal argument, one could argue in a season or two the Cardinals will be starting over from scratch and who knows, Mariota might be blossoming into one of the better QBs in the league. I'm not sure any situational arguments in this discussion hold water."
DynastyFF,3dvbm9,LastOfTheOsirans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"2014 has some seriously awesome rookie WR performances, so it was easy for Brown to be overlooked.  Highly underrated imo, with a stat line of 48/696/5 ranked 9th/7th/8th amongst rookies last year.    He might have paled against the beasts OBJesus, Evans, Sammy, Kelvin, etc, but it was a solid rookie campaign. If he was in any recent WR class he would have been in or around the top 5 rookie WRs, even 2011 when Julio and AJ came into the NFL.  DGB is a beast of a dude, and I was impressed by him in a recent interview, he may have the chops to make it in the NFL.  Plus he has a real good chance to own the depth chart in TEN too.  One for one I wouldn't know for sure who to take, but probably lean on the Brown side, because there is at least some NFL tape on him.  Brown + 2nd is too much."
DynastyFF,3dv9o9,Nikola_Mirotic,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"I was in a pretty similar situation not long ago. I'd stick to my guns if I were you, and use all my fairly early picks on stuff I knew.   I don't know if you're experienced with IDP, but if not, don't worry too much about it to start. There's a lot less variation among starter-level IDPs than there is on offense.   I think drafting for youth might be a good idea, as your understanding for dynasty will grow with your team, and you can maximize your knowledge of dynasty before having to rebuild."
DynastyFF,3dv9o9,sg3751,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"Great that you have a plan! I think one tip that I've seen in a lot of higher level leagues is not to feel bad about reaching for players you want. Unless the youth is really falling if you want to take Cooper at 2.03, do it. The only person to really judge your draft is you. IDP is pretty heavy scoring just from looking at the scoring, but there will also be LB's late...its very deep. I would look to prioritize DE if possible. Its a position that dries up quickly.   Good luck!"
DynastyFF,3dun88,shootout101,3,Sun Jul 19 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"Low cost first year fees.  Taxi squads for rookies.

Reserve an awesome place to draft with a private room and great beer,  with a big draft board (you can find these places for no extra charge! ). tell them you're specifically looking at only certain people to join ... they're one of a select few you're considering because this isn't standard stuff  ... this is an elite league that you can even play in the off season."

DynastyFF,3dun88,Dr_Lollygag,2,Sun Jul 19 17:23:52 2015 UTC,The DLF fourm has a great spot to get owners. In my opinion they have been hit or miss. It's easier to get friends of current owners cause then you have a line of communication to them. The good ones are worth it tho

DynastyFF,3du33o,chkessle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"We need more information about your scoring system and roster in general.  But, even assuming standard scoring, you're also definitely overpaying. Russell is a top 5 dynasty quarterback to have. Get him to throw in a 1st, even if it's like a 2017 first, and I hit accept on that trade. Tevin Coleman and Demarco are probably worth a similar amount. Ryan Mathews isn't really worth anything unless you have Demarco Murray. And Russell Wilson is worth far more than a handcuff RB."
DynastyFF,3du33o,feelitallaround,2,Sun Jul 19 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'm just don't believe the hype around Wilson. I hardly see him finishing in the top 8 QB's this year, that is why I'm trying to move him."
DynastyFF,3du33o,bfro,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if you see the hype.  If there is a single guy in your league who wants Wilson, you can get full price."

DynastyFF,3du33o,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Is this a 1 or 2 QB league? I ask because if I am reading correctly you currently have Andrew Luck, Russell Wilson, and Matt Ryan.   If this is a 1 QB league, I'd do this deal simply because of the unnecessary QB capital that you have, even if I think you're getting the less valuable end. I imagine you could get a decent bit more than Demarco/Mathews for this pair even in 1 QB, but sometimes you have to get the value that is in front of you if you have accumulated QBs like this.  If this is a 2 QB league, I would definitely not do this deal."
DynastyFF,3du33o,feelitallaround,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"You don't think he could get a bit more in return for one of his QBs in a 1QB league? Even if he has too many good QBs, I personally don't think he should rush to get rid of a young one and a rookie RB just to basically put himself in win now mode. That being said, I also understand being in a situation where no one is really offering fair value for a top dynasty QB and getting antsy about it."
DynastyFF,3du33o,chkessle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Most of everyone in my league doesn't believe in the Wilson hype. This guy has been trying to get Coleman off of me since I drafted him.

DynastyFF,3du33o,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"Coleman is worth a lot less than Wilson. Like a ton less. Wilson's ""hype"" is backed by 2 seasons of being a top 10 fantasy QB. Even if 2014 was his high point, he doesn't need to score as many points as that to make top 10.    He's 26 on a competitive team in a tough division, so that's about as good a fantasy situation as there is. So yeah I'm buying the hype."
DynastyFF,3du33o,feelitallaround,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"I said I think he could get more, I am just not huge on telling people they need to ask for more when the deal is acceptable."

You're a little weak at RB and I'd consider trading your TEs for youth. Maybe target Clive Walford?? It looks like it will be a fun team to play with for years to come."
DynastyFF,3ducpj,aussiemac24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comnent. That's about what I am thinking. Definitely punted at RB a bit. If I can make the playoffs this year I will consider it a successful draft. I love my QBS and Dorsett and really like Agholor & Lockett. Walford was in my list but I figured with Bennett locked in I am ok there for a year or 2.
DynastyFF,3ducpj,MrLinderman,2,Sun Jul 19 17:04:43 2015 UTC,Let's just have people rate our whole league!
DynastyFF,3ducpj,blardorg,2,Sun Jul 19 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"Great starting QBs. They're both devalued slightly in 6 pt passing TD relative to other more prolific passers, but that's still probably one of the best starting duos in your league, I'd guess. No solid QB3, though, so injury to either of your starters will torpedo your season.  RBs are solid for starters, though not a lot behind them. Hill will be a top 12-15 RB guaranteed, with upside of top 6 or so, even in full PPR imo, and Vereen should be a top 30 RB in full PPR. Jennings gives you some insurance for Vereen not winning the job, and Ivory might be startable in a pinch, but there's a lot more competition now in NYJ.  WRs are a little weaker than ideal. In full PPR, you'll want to be starting 5. Agholor and Landry are good young talent, but neither will be a top 12 WR, ya know? Charles Johnson, Decker, Stevie Johnson, and LaFell should all be top 30-40 at worst, but all have relatively low ceilings. Charles Johnson does have some upside, but I wouldn't bet a ton on him being better than maybe WR#25 or so. Dorsett and Lockett are nice rookies for the future, but I don't think you can expect anything from them this year.  TE is alright, switching between Bennett and Daniels should get you a top 10 TE each week.  However, that trade for Wilson reeeally hurt you. In a similar superflex 12 team league I was in, someone traded up similarly (8th to 7th pick or 7th to 6th, I don't remember which), and gave up their 8th or 9th round pick. You paid way way way too much. Even if you had just swapped your 3rd for his 7th, that would've been far too much. Something like swapping your 4.05 for his 5.07 should've been plenty (personally, even that would be too much for me, though!).  Keeping more value from that trade would have let you have a much better top 15-20 WR to go with Agholor and Landry. Alternatively, and even better, you could've done something like take Dez/Julio/whoever with your 1st rounder, and taken another QB with your 3rd (I assume you took Tannehill with your 2nd?). Tannehill as QB1, top 10-15 QB for your QB2, and Julio/Dez/whoever as your WR1 would've been better.   It's not a disaster or anything, but I think you're lacking the high end punch at RB, WR, and TE to make a real run for the title. You'll be starting a probably top 8-10 RB in Hill (in full PPR), probably top 20 WR in Agholor, top 25 in Landry, top 6-7 TE in Bennett, etc etc. It's ok to be lacking a high end producer at one spot, but usually you make up for that with more high end talent at another. As it is, your only real standout position is QB."
DynastyFF,3ducpj,Red-Yeti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. Dez and AB and OBJ were gone, and I'm not a fan of Julio. I thought about grabbing Demaryius but opted to go for the trade. I know I paid a lot for Wilson. I'm assuming I would have still gotten Tannehill, but my QB2 would have been someone like Eli Manning or Joe Flacco.  If vereen is only a top 30 RB I'm sunk.  He was top 20 on 2014 and was barely used on a couple games.   With my WR I'm looking for 2016-2017. Hoping Dorsett and Agholor should be monster receivers."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,bastegod,3,Sun Jul 19 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"Take a deep breath.   You whiffed on Hyde in my opinion. A decent talent but not good enough to rise above the shit show they're about to put on.  That team will be bad for a while, with the new system and the core of the defense retiring or leaving.  I'm happy to let someone else hold him and despair.   Parker maybe was a bit of a reach in round 3 as well. But he is a top 15 NFL pick,so he may well produce round 3 numbers for you.   Pick one strategy and ride it out. You said you're punting to build young. Go with that. Don't bother with a RB unless he is really young.    A guy I might take in round 7 is Dorsett if he's still on the board. Agholor, or Perriman if they be there too. Don't be afraid to grab a third year or even fourth WR if you're getting good value at the pick. Young doesn't mean all rookies & second year guys."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,chkessle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:47:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good word. I think I've got my head on close to straight. Would you think it a good idea to shop any of these guys, Hyde/Luck/Parker to any interested parties?"
DynastyFF,3dshx8,chkessle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:20 2015 UTC,Anyone on my roster has a price. Even Luck.  But Luck would require a damn fortune.   I'd be more willing to trade Hyde for the reasons above. I'd expect to get the easiest return from Parker. But I might keep Parker too. It all depends on where you see him with his injury.
DynastyFF,3dshx8,blardorg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"Hyde's a challenge for me. I kinda went against the gut with this pick - a lot of expert ADP had him ranked pretty highly, with some interesting stats regarding his elusiveness and skill (#2 in forcing missed tackles behind only Marshawn Lynch). Also I enjoyed what limited tape I saw from certain games (Dallas and Seattle). Overall I think it was me depending too much on other's insights. Lamar Miller or Mark Ingram may have been a more dependable choice."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,Santidreet,3,Sun Jul 19 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"Cooper at pick 15 is just too early imo, by something like 5-10 picks at least. Which current stud WRs did you pass up to take him? Any of AJ Green, DT, Cobb, Dez, etc, available? What about Lacy or Bell? Cooper might be a phenomenal talent, but he's still on the Raiders, ya know? Even if you're punting this draft, you'd set yourself up better long term if you took a stud receiver and traded them for young talent + picks. Something like taking Green and trading him for two 2016 1sts and Kevin White or something.  The only other thing I'd say is if you're punting this season, I think taking Kelce there was probably too early. Would've been better to grab another young WR and then load up on 1-2 of Ebron, ASJ, Eifert, etc, later. Of course, Kelce might break out this year, in which case you can either keep him or sell him for a nice haul, and I don't think you reached for him or anything. Just not sure he fits your overall strategy that great.  But overall, I like the guys you picked, and I don't think you whiffed or anything. Looks like you've got a plan and have a great start towards making your team!"
DynastyFF,3dshx8,Vacar,2,Sun Jul 19 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. Yeah Cooper was a big hard bite for me. Most of everybody you mentioned unfortunately was gone by then besides Cobb and Lacy were gone. Either of those probably would have been sound investments, though I have personal concerns about Lacy's playstyle/concussion history, and while Cobb is prolific, I'd rather invest in what I evaluate as a true future #1 (finesse, prolific route running, usurped all Julio Jones' records, 10"" mitts - can't resist).   Kelce was definitely a blinded-by the stars pick, and I probably gave up far too much to get him, however I do love him as a player, and I feel like his value will be substantially increased by the end of this year. If even Smith can turn Vernon Davis into a dangerous asset, I feel like Kelce can at least ascend to that level of work.   Parker I have mixed feelings about, though most were positive. My thoughts there were that Miami has nobody of Parker's specific type and profile, and some positive news about him already making waves in OTAs against hardened CB vets like Brent Grimes (whom I have the utmost respect for). That's no guarantee, but it's the kind of upside I like. The foot issue doesn't scare me, as many other WRs (like Julio) have had the same work done without too much complication.   Overall, this was definitely somebody's first draft, heh."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,quickonthedrawl,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"You have a really good young team. Not a whiff for me. You're not ready to win now but in two years you could have the top QB, two top 10 WRs and a top 2 TE. RBs come and go so don't worry."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,Vacar,2,Sun Jul 19 03:49:59 2015 UTC,"I think you'll end up being fine, but this is why I don't like this strategy.  Through 6 rounds (since you traded up), you took:  1.10 - Luck: Decent value here. In a 1 QB league this where he should go around.  2.03 - Cooper: At least 6-8 picks early for this guy. I can't even remember the hype for Watkins last year (who was a better talent at the time) being this crazy. This is a reach.  3.10 - Hyde: That offense seriously scares me. Nothing last year showed he could take over for Gore. People quickly forget that Gore's been a special player his career and that offense didn't just ""give him yards."" I predict Hyde will struggle hard, so ultimately I think this was your biggest reach.  3.11 - Parker: Awesome talent, but this is again too early for a player that's in a crowded passing offense, has health issues, lacks strength, and has trouble running routes. Huge gamble at the backend of the 3rd. Kinda feel this is a reach too.  4.03 - Kelce: Doesn't really fit your ""build young"" scheme. To me he seems like he's a win-now new TE. Good outlook for the next year or two, but I don't see him being the next Gronk. For a rebuild grabbing a TE this early isn't something I'd do. I'd much rather grab ASJ or Eifert later. So, not a reach, but doesn't really fit your scheme.    The rebuild strategy is interesting, but it causes people to reach all over the place. I can only imagine the values you passed up to go super young here.  I wouldn't trade any of your players. You already made the decision to go with these guys and you won't get face value back. Your best bet is to stick it out until some of these players start producing and then you can flip around the team. You're not in a bad spot at all, but if your rookies and two year players don't live up to the hype you might have to ""rebuild"" again soon."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,quickonthedrawl,2,Sun Jul 19 11:32:02 2015 UTC,"They tend to look like reaches to you because your draft board is different! That doesn't mean they're reaches. For my draft board, taking Adrian Peterson in the 3rd round seems like an insane reach too. :)  That's not to say I'm a fan of OP's draft. Hyde and Parker in the 3rd are both very early. Cooper at 2.03 could be early or not, it's impossible to say without knowing who he picked him over: over a guy like Calvin I love. Over a guy like Hopkins, I don't."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,Unpossible42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"Parker wasn't necessarily a reach, but Cooper certainly was.  I've said it before, but that's too early for an unproven WR and the general consensus agrees. Almost every ranking site has him about 6-8 picks later.  In this scenario I think the best thing to do would be to trade down into the late-2nd to grab Cooper. If you're doing a rebuild obviously you don't want Megatron, but he has more value. You could move down in the 2nd to move up in the 3rd and 4th. You lose value taking on the rebuild strategy if you don't trade down/up."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,PHV,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"With Cooper, it really still depends on which receivers are already off the board. He went at 2.06 in my last completed startup, and that seems about right. Three draft spots is hardly a notable reach to me!  Don't agree with regard to Calvin. If he's got more value, it's such a short term situation, that I wouldn't be surprised to see Cooper taken before Calvin in virtually every startup by this time next year. It's not like we're talking about A.J. Green or even Demaryius Thomas, both of whom I could definitely be on board with.  And for one more, look at Cooper's selections in the July DLF mocks. 21, 16, 20, 13, 16, 18. As early as 2.01 and as late as 2.09. We'd have to see OP's draft board to say how much of a reach it was, if at all, but in startups I will never fault somebody for taking ""their guy"" over a slightly better consensus player on the same/similar tier.  100% agreed with regard to trading up and trading down though. I don't like the kind of trade up that OP made. Giving up two whole rounds to grab an extra 3rd rounder seems very greedy.  Edit: FWIW, I took Watkins at 2.08 and 2.06 in two different startups last season at about this time. Even with his stock not quite maturing like I'd hoped, I can't be upset; his value has held steady through one year."
DynastyFF,3dshx8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Only question here is Hyde, but even he's not all that bad.  I would be happy with your team looking in to the future."

Keep Luck, Cooper and Parker unless you get an offer that blows you away.  Shop Hyde and Kelce for young stud WR's.  You're all-in on the youth movement and will likely punt year 1 and get a good draft pick next year, so don't screw up the strategy now, keep going with it.  If Allen Robinson is still on the board I would take him asap, or trade Hyde or Kelce for him.  Later round guys I love in no particular order... Sankey, Crowell, David Johnson, Tre Mason, Duke Johnson/Abdullah should be good in ppr, john brown, josh gordon, ASJ, Eifert  Langford might make for a decent end of bench stash, his value would shoot up if Forte leaves after this season."

This year he'll learn from Gore and then you would imagine Robinson will have a share of the reps at the end of this year and then even more next year.   But this is just speculative, he could fail. He's just in a really good situation to succeed and you can get him for cheap this year."
DynastyFF,3drc78,Santidreet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"I won't call them breakout RBs, but Bell, Hill, Lacy, and Anderson are the RBs under 26 who have the greatest chance of being the best RB in 1-2 years.   Besides them, I would consider Todd Gurley, Melvin Gordon (still overrated), Duke Johnson, Joseph Randle, David Johnson, Ezekiel Elliott, Nick Chubb, Leonard Fournette, Samaje Perine, and Dalvin Cook to be the top candidates. There are plenty of good RBs I'm not mentioning, like Abdullah and Yeldon, but I find it much harder to envision them being the best. It's like how Alfred Morris is still a good RB even if he will never be Adrian Peterson or Jamaal Charles."

I could maybe see him maybe growing into an Alfred Morris, but I think that's his upside. He probably won't be much worse, but he doesn't have the speed to do much more, and I don't think he is aggressive enough in his running for somebody of his size."
DynastyFF,3drc78,umaro900,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:13:02 2015 UTC,Im sorry but I need to ask have you seen him play?
DynastyFF,3drc78,bconbucks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:28:16 2015 UTC,"Every Draft Breakdown clip, as well as some 49ers games and other clips. When I say aggressive, it's not about breaking tackles, it's about how quickly he cuts upfield and the angles he takes when a defender is in his face."
DynastyFF,3drc78,umaro900,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your evaluation at all. I mean you say Hyde is an Alfred Morris type runner. Then you say he doesn't make decisive cuts to get upfield which is exactly what Morris does well. Not to mention hyde is a pretty darn good pass catcher which also doesn't relate to Morris. I watched him for 3 years every game at OSU and really don't see the weaknessess you point out. In my opinion he needs to work on vision, picking the right hole. I would go looks at the tape again."

I don't think those other trades are bad, but it's a lot harder to part with Brown in a league where you should only be starting 2 WR, most likely. Perriman and Yeldon are unlikely to crack your starting lineup, so their value to you is pretty low, but I'm not sold that Dorsett and Gordon (after trade) will either."
DynastyFF,3dqps8,umaro900,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Let's see. I actually thought his first offer was pretty fair, if not weighted in your favorite a bit:  AB = Alshon + CJ  Gordon = Perriman + 1st  Dorsett = 2nd  I personally think AB for Alshon, CJ, and a 1st is pretty solidly in your favor, more than the first deal, but it isn't too terrible. Doesn't hurt to offer it.  If you'd like to get rid of Gordon too, AB+Gordon for Alshon, CJ, Yeldon, and a 1st is really weighted in your favor too. That ends up being like him paying a 1st to upgrade from Yeldon (1.06 or 1.07 probably?) to Gordon (1.03 or 1.04 probably?). So not awful, but definitely in your favor.  Anyway, sounds like you should be able to get something done :) Just don't try to rip him off too much, haha! Your ideas for counters aren't that bad, but I do think they're maybe a bit too much in your favor."

DynastyFF,3dqcnk,gospeedracergooo,3,Sat Jul 18 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the QB throwing to them. I hate having two WRs from the same team bc bye weeks, and being worried they'd never ball out at the same time. But Nelson and Cobb help me win a championship last season, and thats has chaned my opinion some. I think out of the two I'd rather go with Matthews/Agholor but even then thats too risky for my liking. I think that combo won't ball out this year when compared to Jordy/Cobb but could in the future. But on the flip side that combo may only be good as llong as Chip is running things."

(And yet I have three from the Titans, so...)  The reality is that we want players that are going to produce. If the best chance of production happens to overlap with a player that I already have, that's OK. Your team isn't in a vacuum; you can trade players.

DynastyFF,3dqght,quickonthedrawl,2,Sat Jul 18 14:31:48 2015 UTC,Not even close. An offer like that would signal either you took me for a fool or were just trying to unload poopy players to everybody. Robinson is a 3rd round startup pick!

I am high on both Agholor and Robinson, but it's important to note that Cobb is only 24, and IMO his stats from last year are going to be where he is floating around for the next few years. In other words, he is right at the same value as the 27 year old Demaryius Thomas for me (arguably higher), and people value him at 3 first round picks. Agholor and Robinson both have the skills and situations to succeed, but they haven't yet shown they can be that top-tier player you're paying the premium to get - right now they're simply promising first round picks in value."
DynastyFF,3dqght,blardorg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty decent offer for Cobb. Two mid 1sts and a 2nd. Cobb is just outside the top tier of WRs, so holding out for three 1sts is too much. You've got a very young team and could use this to turn one nailed on starter (Cobb) into two or three probable starters.   If you could get a 1st instead of a 2nd, that would be an auto accept for me. If not, I'd still strongly consider it."

DynastyFF,3dqght,OP85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:44:43 2015 UTC,The trade is just about fair. I think it depends on how good your trade partners team is. if thats a low 2nd then no. I would make sure he gives up his 1st. If its a high 2nd. then ya thats about fair. also how do you think your team is going to pan out? i dont know how big your league is but if its a 12man it looks like your a middle of the pack finisher. next year could be good though if your rookies fill those gaps. if its a smaller league maybe its best to get the young talent and look for the future.
DynastyFF,3dpm1l,Crimson-Chin,7,Sat Jul 18 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"If you're getting 1.9/Adams in this trade you just made a killer trade down. The swap of late second rounder for an asset equivalent to a 1st rounder is disgusting, by only moving back three spots."

Youll still probably end up with one of Agholor, Yeldon, Perriman, Parker, or coleman.  In my eyes its the beat move. We know  Adding on to that, the fact you have the 1.3 and 4 will probably give you one RB and 1 WR. If you think agurley and Gordon fall then his trade is a no brainer. Id do this regardless.

DynastyFF,3doinm,quickonthedrawl,2,Sat Jul 18 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"Team Logan and Jason E look like they ended up with pretty good teams (aside from some questionable picks at the end).  Can't really fault you with your picks except, as others mentioned, I'm not sure what your plans were picking Rodgers 1.01.  Given his overall weakness I'd say maybe trade Rodgers to Chris B for Rothelesburger+future picks.  I'd think he believes that he's in a ""win now"" mode and that might be your best bet to ""punt"" while still getting a decent QB that could start for you.  Or, you know, take a risk trading for Foles and get even more picks from him!"

Try getting some extra draft picks and using a random QB off the WW for this season since you aren't realistically going to compete You're pretty thin at RB, you could try selling Tanny for a decent one, but IDK what price that would come at At WR you've got some nice young guys, I'd maybe try selling on Torrey smith but besides that you're set TE: Hope that Hill or Green develops, but if they don't Donnell is okay so you're set there   Sorry I don't have much time. lmk if you have questions."

DynastyFF,3dpf42,That1Time,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats where im at. In that scenario, with three firsts, you probably dont know where the picks are for at least two of them since a couple are likely future picks.  At least with Watkins and 1.01 you know exactly what you are getting. I was totally opposed to trading OBJ for anything this offseason, but this offer at least has me thinking about it."

If I cant get Gurley, my RB slot is pretty weak beyond LeVeon. The more I think about it the more im thinking that im more comfortable with Watkins as my WR2/3 with Gurley/Mason as my RB2, and Latavius off the bench, than OBJ and AJ, and a huge question mark at RB2.  I may be able to swing one of the owners second rounders out of him or swap picks to move up in the first or second round too."
DynastyFF,3dpf42,HugoStrangeMD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:37 2015 UTC,I think it's a fair offer. I'd be a lot more inclined to hit accept if I could get one of those 2nds or maybe both thrown in.
DynastyFF,3dpf42,aussiemac24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:34:56 2015 UTC,I'd do this if I were you and I'm not even super high on Watkins.  Pairing Gurley with Mason is HUGE and gives you two starting RBs plus you'd have Sammy and AJ as two legit WRs.
DynastyFF,3dpf42,smithzack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:59:07 2015 UTC,"If this helps you in your strategy, then do it. It's reasonable. I don't think you'll ever get full price on someone like OBJ because no one is a lock to be a top 5 at their position."
DynastyFF,3dpf42,smithzack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say you're selling too low. Watkins and 1.01 are great assets, but Beckham's one of the top dynasty assets right now. I'd try and get at least one more 1st thrown on there if possible."
DynastyFF,3dpf42,quickonthedrawl,2,Sat Jul 18 04:30:41 2015 UTC,"DynastyLeagueFootball has OBJ at #5 and Watkins at #14 in terms of overall value in dynasty. Other sites have them similar in range. I think its pretty hard to imagine that someone would give up another top WR prospect, 1.01 and another first. I know I wouldnt.  The owner also has 1.04, 2.01 and 2.04. I really doubt that I could get him to throw in 1.04, but maybe one of his seconds.  Im not super interested in trading OBJ, but I think Watkins can be just as much of a stud as OBJ, just might take him another year or two to get there. I think a trade like this could shore up my RB slot for this year, but also set me up pretty solid for years down the road."
DynastyFF,3dpf42,HighMakkaMakka,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:48:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, might just be because I'm a Giants fan lol. Personally I wouldn't trade him unless I was blown away by an offer, but that might be my Giants fan instincts kicking in again.

That's insane value on your roster and WRs are the foundation of any dynasty team. He may not even repeat this year... Or may prove to be a generational talent. I would keep shopping and short of trade-raping, get a little more or else ride him out for the next ten years....thats a decade of WR1 potential. Just sayin."
DynastyFF,3dpf42,doodwhersmycar,-3,Sat Jul 18 05:49:33 2015 UTC,Three firsts for a stud....... Esp for OBJ at possibly his highest ever peak value. You could sell for so much more

DynastyFF,3dpf42,doodwhersmycar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:15:52 2015 UTC,I don't know for my money that Watkins is worth two firsts. For me Watkins is = a first+. If I'm dealing obj I'm going for a lot more than this deal. Not enough for me
DynastyFF,3dp2ki,Gorilla_Presser,2,Sat Jul 18 02:21:08 2015 UTC,I'd probably go Martavis Bryant. I think we've already seen Keenan Allen's ceiling. Bryant was actually pretty consistent last year and I think he'll continue to get good looks with ABrown on the field. His size and speed give him a lot of upside going forward. He'll fit nicely on the back end of your core of receivers.
DynastyFF,3dp2ki,Santidreet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"If I want safety, I'm taking Allen, if I want upside, I'm taking White without thinking. White has potential to be incredible with his skills and athleticism. He's in an offense where they throw a ton and he should benefit."
DynastyFF,3dp2ki,swoodmanroxu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:24:06 2015 UTC,Taking White could be an issue because I have Alshon still this year and next.
DynastyFF,3dp2ki,quixoticFOX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:29:57 2015 UTC,"Edelman feels like a low WR2'ish type for the next two years or so.  Great when gronks out and a bit up and down when he's not.  Allen feels like WR2/3 for the next several years.  No dominant physical attribute has some competition for touches unlike that sublime stretch in '13.  Bryant is not someone i'm that high on.  The bulk of his points last year game in a four game stretch, after which he was less productive than Torrey Smith.  He could become the next antonio brown but the floor still seems like it could be very low.  Too low for my liking.  White is easily the best physical talent of the four and it's not even close.  He's the only one that projects to approach the elite tier that Bryant, Jones, etc. currently occupy.  His floor is pretty high as well.  So, in 2-3 years I think he will be no worse than a high WR3 with the probability being at least a very high WR2 if not tops of WR1.  However, he will be inconsistent for the next 1-2 years, so you'd need to bank on your current receivers until then.    Agholor (didn't have him, but he's in that class).  He projects to produce a ton over the next few years in that Philly offense.  The long-term risk with him is that his value is heavily dependent on Chip Kelly.  If Kelly goes, he'd become more pedestrian (still good but not great).  RB's (also, not mentioned but worthy of consideration for reasons mentioned below)  Yeldon doesn't have the measurables of Cooper/Gurley but he has great opportunity.  That offense made major investments in establishing a run game and could potentially offer a Seattle-like consistency.    Abdullah.  Incredibly productive through college with truly elite short-area shiftiness.  Bell will siphon points this year but likely not beyond.  In that offense, could become a PPR dynamo.  I'd say floor of last year's bernard with ceiling approaching Ray Rice.    Hopefully this helps you make a decision.  Good luck."

WRs hit way more often than 1st round RBs do, and they last a lot longer in the league typically. We just had our rookie draft and the first six picks went Gurley, Gordon, Yeldon, White, Winston, Cooper. I got Cooper with the 1.06 by some freaking miracle but had originally planned on taking whatever one of those 3 RBs fell to me. When they didn't I had to switch strategies obviously because of who was on the board and I drafted David Johnson with 2.06(I'm an Ellington owner).

In 3-4, they'll all start to enter their prime of 24-25 and for the next 4-5 years be in it. Landry is definitely worth more than that. I would say in between the 1.05 and 1.06 this year straight up is about what his value is. If you absolutely want to trade him, get a 2016 1st and 2nd from a lower end team."

If he is in a win 3-4 years from now those picks can be traded down the road, they can be traded for higher picks or even traded for other players. They don't just have to be used for 2017 rookies.   Also 1.05 is a little bit rich for him in a non PPR league. But that's just my opinion."

Antonio Brown may be the single most valueable WR in the league right now, and you have a stellar 1 2 punch with him and Hilton.  Don't focus on the immediate gains here.  Develop your long term plan with a target date in mind.  Not knowing the rest of your team here hurts a bit, but with those 2 players, you could make a run as early as next year."

DynastyFF,3dnm2e,RouxBalls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:03:14 2015 UTC,"I would rather just hold onto Watkins. I'm not a fan of DGB at his current price point, and Kelce provides (on paper) an upgade - but a relatively minor upgrade - over your current platoon IMO."
DynastyFF,3dnm2e,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think I just want to win so bad this year.  Only a 3rd round rookie pick in 2016 for me.  Does Watkins stock rise this year? I think he's at his highest right now, and it appears to be falling."
DynastyFF,3dnm2e,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"That depends. I have him in the 12th-14th overall pick range on my board, whereas he's been going more in the 18th-20th range on DLF mocks (and behind Amari Cooper!). So I'm not selling him personally, I'm buying him."
DynastyFF,3dnm2e,PM_ME_CABBAGE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm super hot on Owen Daniels. Peyton loves his receiving TEs, and Kelce wouldn't be a huge upgrade with Maclin and Charles in town.   Watkins only feels less spectacular than he is because of how deep last year's WR class was."
DynastyFF,3dnm2e,boredatworkbored,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:09 2015 UTC,"Daniels could be splitting time with Virgil Green. He's been talking about being more involved in the receiving game this year and even attended Manning's receiving clinic. I feel like both will be boom or bust, or one will emerge to fill JT's roll"
DynastyFF,3dnlpm,LittleHelpForAFriend,2,Fri Jul 17 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"I like it. Youre more towards win now than anything and Cobb is gonna contribute immediately and for a while! cJ is also gonna be useful on that offense, especially since its PPR!I expect him to exceed expectations. Overall its a fair trade for both parties, but given your team I think it makes sense to accept!"
DynastyFF,3dnlpm,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:36 2015 UTC,I like this for you. I think Cobb is far and away the best guy in this trade. Spiller and Murray aren't too far apart.
DynastyFF,3dnlpm,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:42 2015 UTC,What's your starting lineup requirements?
DynastyFF,3dnlpm,Wetzilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:46:32 2015 UTC,"1QB, 1RB, 2WR, 1TE, 2 FLEX, 2 IDP."
DynastyFF,3dnlpm,Wetzilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:55 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely do this. If you only need to start one RB Gore, Forte, and Spiller are perfectly acceptable, and upgrading from Perriman to Cobb is huge. And with only starting 2 IDP players basically the only one that matters is Watt."
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,lionsfan22,5,Fri Jul 17 15:02:52 2015 UTC,Luck is the most valuable single player in a 2QB league.  You better be getting a ton more if you're going to part with him.
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,shack026,3,Fri Jul 17 15:09:44 2015 UTC,Didn't notice this was two QB.. I wouldn't do this trade. QB is too important
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,mattmurf77,2,Fri Jul 17 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"I would not trade Luck, especially in a two QB league. You don't have a proven 2nd QB to make up the difference between Luck and Tannehill."
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,LittleHelpForAFriend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"I really think the Tannehill love is out of control. I seem to be the only person who thinks Tannehill will not be elite. Is he a top 10 QB, sure possibly. But so are Romo, Ryan, Stafford, Dalton, Flacco, Brady, Cam, RG3, Eli, Any Eagles QB, etc. I like Jameis more than I like Tannehill and he hasn't even played a down in the NFL yet. Now that I'm off that soap box, there's no way you can trade Luck without getting more depth than that. As others said, in a 2QB leauge Luck is the top asset. To me, as much as there is to like about Gronk, there were doubts he would even be playing again this time last year. I'd rather go for Ertz/Kelce and get Hill+Cooks  EDIT: Not to mention getting 2 decent QBs in return (See any from the list above)"
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"No one is suggesting Tannehill will be elite, but he is a very solid QB2 in a 2QB league and a good QB1 in 1 QB leagues. Your opinion about Jameis is fair enough, but you have to admit ( as you do) that you're basing that on absolutely nothing, whereas with Tannehill we have a very good season from him in 2014 and the addition of even more weapons to bump his value moving forward."
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,sicknarlo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:55:12 2015 UTC,I appreciate everyone's feedback I agree with everyone that Luck is too valuable I'm not going to make the move.
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,blardorg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it isn't just that it's 2QB, but also 6 pt passing TD and 20 passing yards per point both make Luck even more valuable. I actually still don't think it would be an awful trade for you, but I probably wouldn't do it and think you'd need a bit more for it to be even."
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,jdr393,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:49:43 2015 UTC,My first thought - I like this trade. Then clicked in and saw 2QB. Don't like it in that format. Keep Luck or get more back.
DynastyFF,3dmq7b,username02,0,Fri Jul 17 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"This trade is definitely not worth it. Gronk is good, but not that good. Tannehill doesn't really bridge the gap between Luck and Gronk either. In 2QB he is just too valuable. Especially with those scoring settings."
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,adamtypeslike,3,Fri Jul 17 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain and say I would rather not do this trade. Kelce has put up points more consistently over a longer period of time than ARob, and at a position where it's more difficult to find production."
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,camomilk,4,Fri Jul 17 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"I agree.  TE is a wasteland right now. Kelce has been superb with his limited opportunities.  With legitimate talent at the wr position, Kelce should have more room and be more productive than last year.  I like ARob, but the hype on him is a bit crazy right now.  I think you have solid wr's and don't need to make this trade.  There should be plenty of talent available at the wr position in an 8 team league, but I doubt there are any good te's."
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,ookla76,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"I think this makes sense for both parties. Both are unproven but high potential talents. You have TE covered already, so sure why not. You may want to try to get Walford/ASJ/Rudolph/etc as a stash behind Graham now."
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"They're pretty close in ADP, so it's a fairly even trade.  I'd make the trade if I were you as I'm not as high on Kelce as most other people."
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,Banzif,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:53:17 2015 UTC,I would do this trade. Fair value.
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,Jesselock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"I like Kelce more than ARob right now. He's a top 3 TE and A Rob isn't even a top 15 WR. Good TE's are hard to find and as others have said, Kelce has shown more. I think you can get more for Kelce. Even though you have Graham and might not even start Kelce, that doesn't change his value to other people."
DynastyFF,3dmpvq,JDriley,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"I think Graham and Kelce are going to put up even numbers, even with Graham in SEA. I'm assuming you can only start one TE, and you wont want to have a TE in the flex, so if you can get Arob for Kelce I would do it."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,username02,3,Fri Jul 17 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend a superflex for 10-12 team leagues.  It makes the qb position a battleground, and provides serious value to even middling qbs.  It also helps with trading, since a mid-tier qb like Flacco becomes a key trade piece."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,panchojulio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'm in a 12 team double flex but no superflex. have Romo as my backup and I want to move him as I'm trying to get younger.

DynastyFF,3dn9mw,adrianp07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"not having a full flex W/R/T can be a deal breaker for me. I played in a WR/TE league one year, and it was the only flex spot and I had 3 good RB's and it pissed the hell out of me that I couldn't line up my best team and had to look for trades for 2 weeks."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,adrianp07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I actually like the unpredictability of D/ST and Kicker. People are losing sight of why we play fantasy football. Yes it's to win money but I know I play it because it makes the NFL 10x more interesting. I love it. What's more exciting than a guy from your D/ST bringing back a kick return and winning you the matchup that week? I like having more variables in my lineup. Yeah it's nice to win, but if I lose a week and have a great time it's not a big deal to me. For me, DST doesn't take anything away from FF for me but it does add unpredictability and more fun.   DST or K wouldn't be a deal breaker for me. I'd still join a league. But I gotta admit, I like having it."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,Santidreet,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"I like them both in redraft, but I despise them in dynasty. My one argument is simple:  The ideal strategy regarding D/STs and K is to drop them as soon as you are out of contention and/or as soon as the offseason starts. They're a position that lacks so much value that literally any position player is a better hold through the offseason. That's bad for the game, IMO."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,quickonthedrawl,0,Fri Jul 17 18:31:43 2015 UTC,"How is that true? Say the Seahawks kill it this year. Best defense. Still pretty young. you'd drop them next offseason for ""literally any position player"". Same thing with kickers. Say Cody Parkey is a top 2 kicker again. You'd drop him for any one?   I get that they're not as valuable as position players. By a lot. But I'd rather have Cody Parkey then like Jeremy Kerley or someone like that."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,Santidreet,2,Fri Jul 17 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"Well for one, I would never end up with the Seahawks on my roster because of how I treat the position. But the turnover from year-to-year is just SO HIGH with regard to D/STs. Look at the Seahawks last year. For the first half of the year, I dealt with questions every week in /r/fantasyfootball about people wanting to drop them and start streaming. For the first 11 weeks of the season, they were average or worse.  Top 5 D/STs become bottom 5 and bottom 5 become top 5 almost every season.  The problem with kickers is different, but with the same result. The value of Cody Parkey over the next kicker on the wire is almost nil. Sure, Parkey is going to be around for longer, but how many more points per game is he going to score than the K13 on the waiver wire? Sure, Kerley is probably never going to be a guy that you want, but is Jeremy Kerley really the top WR on your waiver wire?"
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a perspective thing too. You'd rather have the lotto ticket potential upside and id rather have the difference in points between good DST/K and average ones.   And Parkey and the Seahawks were just examples. I realize there's a lot of turnover with D's from year to year. Parkey won me multiple games in redraft last year by having like 12-17 point games against most kickers who are between 5-10.   In the dynasty's I'm in, there's basically no one on the waiver wire that I want to have. The rosters are big and there's not much left over."
DynastyFF,3dn9mw,Santidreet,3,Fri Jul 17 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, and Parkey had a really good season. Like all Kickers, he also had some dud games too, although probably fewer than average. Parkey might be one I'd keep, Gostkowski too.  Look at the guys below them though and how much they scored. The difference between Viniateri (K3) and Tucker (K11) is less than one point per game, and I have to imagine that's well within the margin of error when it comes to projecting their scoring going forward.  Going deeper, the K12 and K22 were separated by less than 1 point per game also."

DynastyFF,3dmkd3,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"I think Spiller ends the year with 45 rec, ~400 yds and 3 TDs (so replaces Pierre Thomas). Split the rest between Toon and Coleman I suppose."
DynastyFF,3dmkd3,username02,2,Fri Jul 17 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"No that's way too pessimistic, that's less than 3 catches a game. I think he puts up 65-75 receptions if healthy, and about 7ypr, so 400-520 and who knows on tds. Could get lucky and get 6ish, could get only 3 or 4. 4-5 catches gives him a decent floor in ppr leagues. The dude is younger, bigger and faster (not stronger though) and should outperform what PTCruiser did"
DynastyFF,3dmkd3,blackngold14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"is this assuming the passing numbers stay the same?  I think they've shown they want to be a more run-heavy offense with their use of Ingram last year and their offseason moves. (trading graham for Unger and drafting Andrus Peat at 13).  I think projecting Brees for the same stats he put up last year is being too high on Brees.    That said, I like your thoughts on Spiller and Cooks and think Colston (not mentioned) gets a bit of a bump as well."
DynastyFF,3dmkd3,feyman007,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yes it's projecting the same stats. Brees had a 'down' year, so figured it was a relevant benchmark. I also assumed Colston remained the same (not impacted by changes), so that's why he is omitted. Your points about grabbing Unger and drafting Peat are very warranted though."
DynastyFF,3dmkd3,gibbsftw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"Brees has averaged like 5,000 yards and 36 TDs while playing for NO.  I doubt that changes much."

DynastyFF,3dmkd3,ookla76,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Brees isn't going to drop off all that much in production.  He did lose a ton of talent around him, but I think he's the type of player that can change his game and still be effective. His td total will go down a bit, but so will his interceptions. You should drink the kool-aid on Spiller.  If he can stay healthy, he's gonna be a nightmare in the dome.  He doesn't need a ton of touches to put up fantasy numbers, but the Saints will need to feed him the ball for lack of other options.  To me, that says high floor/high ceiling.  I'm hoping Toon will step up and be the guy to eat up the targets left behind by Stills and Graham.  I've got him as my wr4/5 this year on my dynasty team.  If he doesn't pan out, I'll have to scramble for a replacement."
DynastyFF,3dmkd3,blackngold14,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"I think Spiller takes a lot of targets and receptions which is somewhat offset by what PT had last last year. I do not think 70 catches is unreasonable - Spiller will be the Saints second most dynamic weapon on offense. Cooks production will increase some but honestly I don't like him as much as some do as a number 1 receiver. Better than last year but will still be inconsistent. I think Toon will be the new producer with Morgan/Jones serving as deep threats and Coleman sharing time with Toon. I think Toon actually has the most potential over the next few years as Colston is regressing and Toon is his carbon copy. Spiller is the only one I'd bet on of the expected new offensive weapons.   And by the way I don't disagree with you in ppr. Ingram will be wearing out the middle while Spiller gets the ball in space and picks up a minimum 65 receptions if he's healthy this year. Unless Ingram dials up a boatload of rushing TDs, I think Spiller will be right around Ingram in ppr"

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brad227,4,Fri Jul 17 01:25:54 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing about Agholar, at least for me; is that I've seen a ton of content trumpeting him up due to his situation. In actuality, I despise his situation.  There's a lot of moving pieces in Philly and I'm not sure it will ever be an offense in which a WR can garner true WR1 numbers.  Conversely, I've seen very little of people ranking him highly because he's good at football.  I think he's a superb player for what he is.  He's the rare type that I profile as ""just slot type"" but still think he has the upside to produce big seasons. He may be more important in actual football than in fantasy. I like him for all the wrong reasons."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,peckx063,3,Fri Jul 17 02:17:09 2015 UTC,Desean Jackson was the number 9 standard scoring WR two years ago and Maclin was number 9 last year in Chip's two seasons. Riley Cooper and Jordan Mathews both  had a productive season respectively in those years as well so this would indicate it is a good situation even for ehhh kinds of players.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,SoloDolo10,3,Fri Jul 17 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah a guy can definitely have a big season there. I guess what I was getting at is that it seems like a very unstable place.  You named 4 WR in 2 years.  Even at QB, they've gone from Vick to Foles to Sanchez to Bradford to who knows. There's no telling what the Eagles will look like in a year, so why draft an Eagle based on situation?"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,peckx063,5,Fri Jul 17 03:20:24 2015 UTC,When you put in those terms I think I see what you mean and it's a good point. There has been production but it's been a revolving door which sucks for Dynasty. Good call

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,detphi1,2,Fri Jul 17 11:21:52 2015 UTC,"You bring up a good point which I also think could go the other way. I fall more into the camp of ""chip is insane"" rather than ""chip is a genius"". I don't think the Eagles have a good year and I think he's set them up for disappointment.

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:27:49 2015 UTC,Still reading down... from a dynasty perspective I do see your point. Chip is hard to predict and that doesn't just create problems for D-Coordinators. Shipping off McCoy and Foles were very bizarre. It will be interesting to see if this behavior changes now that he has 'his' guys.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:02:34 2015 UTC,"As an Eagles fan I worry about the viability of offensive weapons in Philly moving forward (because what's better than owning your favorite players on your favorite team and CRUSHING the souls of your enemies?). The numbers DJax and Maclin put up had a lot to do with the lack of receiving threats behind them on the depth chart, Cooper is trash, Avant was old and slow, and last year the guys with actual talent were rookies. I think Chip wants to go to an attack where the ball is spread around in a more balanced fashion that makes the offense unpredictable. I actually wouldn't be surprised if Matthews, Huff, Agholor, Ertz and Sproles all had 80-100 targets a piece with no one really dominating targets in the way a #1 WR does. I think he's looking to do the same at RB with the group they put together. Chip loves to run the ball and I think he wants to spread that love as well. We had over 400 carries as a team so I wouldn't be surprised to see Murray with 200-250 and Mathews with 150-200 and then <50 for Sproles. The weapons themselves I don't think will be top 5 guys, but he'll support a bunch of RB2s, WR2s and a low end TE1. I think at QB his offense is designed for a top 5 fantasy player. I'm buying the Bradford, Sanchez platoon on the cheap wherever possible."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Paloma_II,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"I also might have to respectfully disagree. I won't be shocked when this offense supports a top 5 WR, top 5 RB, and top 5 QB."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,3,Fri Jul 17 12:01:01 2015 UTC,"Similar train of thought, but on Perriman"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,2,Fri Jul 17 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"I think Perriman's situation is a little different though because of the proven track record of Ozzie Newsome. Sure, there's some risk involved with him, But when Newsome drafts someone, it's something that is a pretty strong indication of a guy's talent. Sure Newsome has picked a dud every now and then (see Matt Elam) but he's still one of (if not, the) best in the business at evaluating talent.  As far as his situation on the field, I think Perriman is in a good situation for his development. He'll get to learn from a great coaching staff and from some good veterans who know what it takes to win. Guys like Flacco and Steve Smith are going to be able that his work ethic is at a place where it needs to be. The coaching staff has proven to develop good young players who have been able to contribute at a high level. I just think the difference between the two situations is that one is being looked at from a schematic standpoint (Agholor) and the other is looking at an organization as a whole."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,the_real_Alex14,3,Fri Jul 17 08:36:47 2015 UTC,"Ozzie's track record with WR is not great.  The last time they drafted a starter caliber WR was Torrey Smith.   Perriman will be given every opportunity and so he's clearly worth grabbing, but then every other young WR on that team has been hyped as the next big thing. Marlon Brown, Deandre Carter, Darren Waller, Aiken, Campanero. After Perriman it is hard to determine who will be their WR in a year. The way everyone else there is hyped makes me have questions about taking any Ravens receiver."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,chkessle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:39:30 2015 UTC,"Fair, but how many of those guys were in the first round. The last first round WR they took was Mark Clayton way back in 2005. Since then they've only used two picks in the first three rounds on a WR (2007 3rd round Yamon Figurs, and 2011 2nd round Torrey Smith). Source. While there have been a bunch of picks made at the position, very few of them in the past 10 years have been high picks. With that being said, Newsome has a proven track record of nailing it in the first round, so it's understandable for people to be excited about Perriman based in that."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,the_real_Alex14,2,Fri Jul 17 15:22:40 2015 UTC,"You're saying that his misses don't count because they weren't first rounders. I'm not buying that. They drafted some WR in day 2 of the draft who haven't panned out. At the same time, Newsome passed on some WR who would have been difference makers in rounds 1-3.    I agree that Newsome ' s defensive picks and his ability to get comp. picks makes him an excellent drafter overall.  But his WR drafts haven't been great."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,chkessle,2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:48 2015 UTC,He hasn't even played a snap yet though

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Unpossible42,4,Fri Jul 17 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"I have Gronk and just wouldn't be able to let him go.  Even if he only plays 2 more years, he BLOWS AWAY every other TE out there.   I also acquired him for Eifert an Bradshaw 2 years ago...WIN!"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,gibbsftw,3,Fri Jul 17 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the ""acquire gronk at all costs"" guys, but honestly he's the perfect player to sell if you're looking to rebuild or just want to replenish your youth."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Cavemansol,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:47 2015 UTC,completely agree. This time last time last year was a totally different story
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,5,Fri Jul 17 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"He's not overrated, but every team seems better after they trade Andrew Luck. You can get so much for one player."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:39:00 2015 UTC,We play 6 pt passing td's so I'm keeping luck until he retires. I'd rather have one position to not worry about for the forsee able future and continue to upgradr wr's and rb's.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,ADQG,3,Fri Jul 17 03:50:23 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you because I am in a 6 pt passing TD league too. My startup was last year and I ended up with Cutler and Smith as my starters because I focused on depth at other positions. I just traded V Jax, Jace Amaro, and a 3rd rounder for Tannehill and feel great about it! I didn't want to reach for Winston or Mariota and actually Winston was picked 5th overall in our rookie and Amari Cooper fell to me at 6! But yeah, 6 pt Pass TDs is a huge consideration to get a legit QB."

I think my situation just resonated with his because my team was decent last year but we also have -2 pts for interceptions so the QB position (damn you cutler!) kept me from winning like 4-5 close games. If the offer is right, I would trade Tannehill or Luck in an instant. Dynasty is great because it is a long game and you can get a ton of value from trading someone to the right person."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Hawxfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, I recognize this league.... :)  I like the moves you made, and Cooper was a nice grab at 1.06."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,camomilk,2,Fri Jul 17 17:09:10 2015 UTC,I feel like that's what everyone says. But that's a dumb way to think about it. I would rather have 3 really good players with upside and an average QB rather than great QB.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:09:25 2015 UTC,To each their own. I'm probably that dynasty owner you could sell Luck for a decent price for. I just feel having my qb position locked up for 10 years is better than having a wr + rb combo that lasts much less than that.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,ADQG,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:45:03 2015 UTC,I don't see the appeal in trading Luck in most situations.  I mean it's a no-brainer if you're stocked on young QBs or otherwise in the right situation to roll with a different QB.  But say you're doing a trade where you trade down at QB (Luck to somebody else) and then trade up in another area.  Why trade now?  Every indication points to Luck retaining value for the foreseeable future of his career.  Unless trading Luck nets you an absurd return (like I give you Luck for Antonio Brown and Jamaal Charles or something) you're only going to upgrade to a guy at a different position whose value won't hold as long as Luck's value will.  At least that's my opinion.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Zargyboy,5,Fri Jul 17 02:35:26 2015 UTC,"I just did a PPR startup draft where Andrew Luck when first overall. Give me 4 first round picks (the going rate for the first overall player these days) and literally any QB in the league, and I'll trade Luck away, no questions asked."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, picks I can see.  What I'm thinking is that if you're getting an upgrade to a guy who will decline in a few years, say like DThomas with some other QB, for Luck why take the deal?  You could probably get the same deal of, say, ODB+a QB in 3 years from now for Luck and you would have had 3 years of Andrew Luck.   But yes, 4 1st I would take all day!  Edit: Full Disclosure: I have Andrew Luck in my Dynasty league haha."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Zargyboy,2,Fri Jul 17 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"OK, but what if that ""some other QB"" is Aaron Rodgers? His DLF ADP is 19th overall. Again, if you're dealing with somebody who treats Andrew Luck as the most valuable dynasty asset, you can get a metric shit ton worth of value back.  This is a contrived example since somebody who has Luck #1 won't have Rodgers #19, but trading the 1st overall asset for the 19th overall asset should also get you something like the 20th overall asset in addition. Would you trade Andrew Luck for Aaron Rodgers and Gurley/Cooks/Hill/Cooper? IMO it's a no brainer to say yes to anything on that order.  Not to mention there are a dozen QBs not named Luck or Rodgers that are still good enough to use as a QB1 on a championship team, and who cost a fraction of the price.  #teamlateroundqb"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,quickonthedrawl,2,Fri Jul 17 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"Fair points that people could overvalue Luck and give up a ton.  Perhaps you are right that there are theoretical deals that, value wise, would be justified.  My main point is that I believe since he's a QB his value will depreciate at a slower rate so you could get the same return in a few years while reaping the benefits of having him now."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Zargyboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"My main point is that I believe since he's a QB his value will depreciate at a slower rate so you could get the same return in a few years while reaping the benefits of having him now.    Very fair point. I would take the first ridiculous overpay that I could find, but couldn't fault you if this was your plan instead."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,quickonthedrawl,3,Fri Jul 17 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"As QOTD said, you can get the equivalent of four firsts for him. I usually see him go for a package including a middle tier QB, a young stud WR and another first round pick or two. So in most cases, your team becomes significantly better. It's nothing against Luck."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:54:23 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, maybe I'll have to try this...."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Zargyboy,3,Fri Jul 17 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"In my league it was Luck, and two middle round startup picks for Landry and FOUR 2016 firsts."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Santidreet,4,Fri Jul 17 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"Ameer Abdullah.  His ADP is several spots above Mark Ingram, despite there being real questions about his ability to produce as a 3 down back.  Very few teams can sustain a passing down back, and I'm not sure that the Lions will be one of those teams with Megatron and Tate soaking up targets.  Ebron may also see a significant uptick in targets this year as well.  I'm not saying that Abdullah is bad or anything, but I think that he is overvalued based on his ADP.  I'd sell him if I had him, before he puts up dodgy numbers in-season."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,hokiepride,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:03:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is his ADP has that risk baked in. He's going a little lower than Gio in startups so even if his cieling is just to be a high end passing back that's exactly what he's priced at right now. On the other hand if he does turn out to be a 3 down back he becomes an incredible bargain. I think he's a very safe pick at his ADP, especially in PPR."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,boredatworkbored,5,Fri Jul 17 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"Seems to be the unpopular opinions, but I would sell Cooks and Davante Adams at their current prices. The hype train on these guys is real and I don't think the numbers back them up  Reception Perception explains my Davante hate better than I could. He had his moments but overall he was extremely unimpressive against every coverage. Of course he's young and has good size so he could develop, but I'm not taking a developmental player I don't believe in in the top 50  As for Cooks, I might be a few percentage points off on these numbers but in his first 5 games, when the Saints were the pass heavy Saints Cooks averaged 9 targets a game at 7 yards per reception, which is pretty much exactly what you want for a PPR machine. While he was gone the Saints switched the the run heavy offense they kept all year and when he came back hiss stats did a 180, he averaged 5 targets a game for 14 yards per reception, which is what a player only used as a deep threat looks like. Here's where my fear comes in: Cooks as a deep threat can be useful, but it's extremely rare a deep threat brings 2nd round value. To add to this, they traded away Stills. If Cooks slides into the Stills role, he's still appealing, but not nearly as much as the all over the field PPR machine that everybody is hoping he will be."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think ""unpopular"" is key to selling high. I think at some point Adams's stock will be higher than it is now but I also expect it to be lower in the short term. To me, right now he's a classic sell high guy because it's likely most owners got him relatively cheap. Not everyone can fulfill their hype and if you sell high on a lot of those guys then in aggregate you earn talent versus what you've expended on it."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,2,Fri Jul 17 02:50:36 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I would sell high on these two in a second. Cooks fell to me in the 3rd in my startup so I grabbed him but flipped him day after the draft with Teddy for Gronk.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:00:19 2015 UTC,"Harmon's numbers have done more to crush my Adams dreams than anything else could have. Currently have my head in the sand with regard to him and Watkins. Both have shown an extraordinary amount of talent at the NCAA level but need to continue their development against NFL-quality DBs before I'll feel at ease with my heavy investment in both.  Since Adams is still in a holding pattern in most people's eyes, I think it's safe to get a slightly larger sample size on him (at least 1/2 season) before looking to move out of my positions there. But I am definitely more nervous now than I was a month ago."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:03:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. I do believe that Watkins is more talented though and can make up for some of the lapses in his game.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,chkessle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"Teams don't trade up into the first round to draft a role player (deep threat receiver) usually. The role player would have to be transcendent at that role. If the Saints had wanted a deep receiver they could have grabbed such player easily in free agency. Or kept Stills, who did that. I've seen Cooks go for a lot in drafts, but it's the Saints, not the fans, who seem to have the big plans for him, and that's what's fueling the fire."

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Gway22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:35:32 2015 UTC,His situation improved in the offseason though with the departure of Stills and Graham. He is going to be the number 1 option on a ton of plays this year.

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,chkessle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"The numbers also show a rookie who got 7 targets per game. With them dropping Graham and Stills that number should go up. A guy getting 120+ targets a year is usually going to be a legit fantasy starter.   Maybe not a #1, but that sheer volume is hard for me to ignore."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can just say ""7 targets a game"" it's the breakdown of pre injury vs post injury targets that worries me, because of the obvious change in the Saints game plan"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,chkessle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"Then by that same token you can't talk about his ypc numbers being indicative of a deep threat player.   Again, they traded up to get him.  They gave him 7 targets a game.  Payton and Brees both say how good he is. What more indication do you need taht he's their #1 guy?"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I talk of him being a deep threat, because that's how they used him in their revamped run heavy offense. We both know better than to buy into coaches and players talking about each other."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Adams. He may be good, but he isn't someone I'd want to depend on every week. There's no way he beats out Jorday/Cobb and they aren't going anywhere."

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,FaceSmashers,3,Fri Jul 17 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"TJ Yeldon all day for me.   I have learned my lesson after watching Ingram and T Rich be unstoppable at Alabama and then come out and then be underwhelming at the NFL level. Yes, you can point to Eddie Lacy as the counter point to my argument but honestly I don't think he's that great from watching him play. I think he just gets to play in an incredible offense and doesn't have much competition. Defenses can't stack the box against him so he is able to put up numbers.   And I haven't even mentioned Yeldon is playing in Jacksonville. While I like his long term potential, I don't foresee Bortles becoming the next Aaron Rodgers and allowing Yeldon to face the favorable defenses that Lacy gets to see.  My prediction is that Yeldon plays a few disappointing years in Jacksonville then moves to another team and gets into an RBBC situation. Not exactly what I am looking for out of my first round pick."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,PHV,2,Fri Jul 17 12:56:13 2015 UTC,The most overdrafted RB imo right now in rookie drafts.
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,4,Fri Jul 17 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"I think Cooks, Graham, Tannehill, Hopkins, Hilton, and Todd Gurley are all people I'd be willing to deal at their current value. Cooks, Hopkins, and Tannehill I think just have too much expectations on them that I see them actually sustaining. Graham's value is all over the board right now. Hilton I don't think will sign with Colts, so long term I think he will not be as effective as he is now. And the only reason why I would say Gurley is because he is valued as a Top Dynasty RB without seeing the field. The only RB that seems unquestionably more valued is Bell, which is crazy because he is coming back from an ACL and playing a position that tends to not play all 16 games. I just don't see him making it through the NFL season healthy either."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,bplush,3,Fri Jul 17 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"I like all of this, but hope you're wrong about Tanny and Hopkins. as I have them in too many leagues."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,umaro900,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"I believe that Hopkins is certainly below where his value should be, and Tanny is no higher than he should be. I can definitely agree with the hype exceeding the value on the other guys."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:11 2015 UTC,He's being drafted as a top 20 guy. You really think he's undervalued?
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,umaro900,2,Fri Jul 17 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"IMO people seem to think there's a huge gap between him and 1st-tier guys like Brown, Dez, Green, Julio, DT, Beckham, and Evans. I would probably take all of those guys over Hopkins in most situations, but unless I'm selling everything to win now I'm not going to pay a first with Hopkins to get them. I think there is a reasonable argument to be made that Hopkins holds more value than those older 1st-tier guys (especially DT) for still having 4-5 more peak years of his career remaining than they do.   Also, in the most recent dynastyFF mock, somebody picked Amari Cooper over him, which I think is just crazy. I generally value Cobb a little higher than him, but after him and those other guys I already mentioned, I think he's the most valuable WR (and I say this as a huge fan of both the Bears and Alshon)."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:01:28 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on liking the talent, but I see Hopkins producing at a WR2 level in that offense. Plus, I don't see him getting a ton of TDs until Arian Foster goes away. He's going to steal a lot of RZ looks."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,umaro900,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:06:10 2015 UTC,Situations change. By the time Hopkins is 26 there's a good chance he has a better QB while Dez and DT have a worse one.

Matt Forté - It's really hard to deal older backs, but if you aren't one of the best teams in your league and you own Forté, I'd try to move him to a team that is for...well...anything. A draft pick? A young prospect? I'm in.  DeMarco Murray - It's hard to trade overused backs, but some owners aren't savvy and still consider Murray a top-10 back. Same with Forté, I'd be looking for a pick or a prospect.  CJ Anderson/Justin Forsett/Joseph Randle - Guys who only have value because of their situation and their situation was due mainly to luck. Anderson only starts cause Ball was a bust. Forsett needed beatings, injuries, and poor play to get a starting spot. Randle is just a starter by default at this point. None are starters because of their talent and that's not the kind of guy I want."
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"I don't like your CJ Anderson point.

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,lawofmurphy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:18:44 2015 UTC,Yes. It's possible a guy comes out of nowhere and stakes his claim to a starting job. Arian Foster did it. Alfred Morris did it.

But he's also on the shakiest ground and his starting gig is more speculative than the others. So...a 2nd RIGHT NOW seems appropriate. You can be risky and hold tight for the time being. If he gains a clear starting spot, you can go for the 1st. Or if you have a competitive team, hold on to him if he's doing well and try to trade him after the season.  Just my opinion, though!"

None of the logic should come as a surprise. Rex and Roman have no track record of developing a QB or creating a good offense that features wide receivers. There's no QB there and won't be for years. I am the type to never put any value into situation, but this situation is here for at least the next 2 years. If you're looking to win, Watkins isn't going to be part of the nucleus that helps you do that. Coming off a 1k season, there's someone in your league who's buying into Watkins talent."

DynastyFF,3dkoa4,NannigarCire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"why? If you're in a win now mode, what are you expecting out of Watkins that you can't get out of someone like Jeffery? Think the bills magically pull out a QB or Rex decides he's comfortable letting the offense move?"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,danceKevindance2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"Watkins is a beast after the catch, 18 yards away from 1000 as a rookie with Kyle Orton throwing him the ball and an absolute joke at HC and OC. He is going to be great fantasy player and it would be foolish to get rid of him imo"
DynastyFF,3dkoa4,NannigarCire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"Rex and Roman are way more of a joke at the coaching positions than Marrone when it comes to offense and neither of them have created anything good out of the offenses handed to them outside of the run game. They have no QB on the roster that's even as good as Orton. You're looking at a year of Watkins hoping to get YAC with minimal touchdown potential on a weak offense and then another year of the same thing, even if they do draft a rookie since Rookie production at QB is amazingly low especially under a Ryan offense.  You could probably trade Watkins for Cooks and extra, and see way more production."

DynastyFF,3djfu4,m_plis,7,Thu Jul 16 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that the TE landscape is a wasteland. Part of it that he's got monster size (6'6"", 260+) and decent speed. He was productive during his short-ish time at college and broke out early, both good signs. Winston targeted his TE a ton at FSU and has a great amount of upside himself, which should hopefully benefit all aspects of the TB offense. The Bucs OC has a history of good TE production, though of course any offense featuring Tony Gonzalez can say that.  All in all, I think the first point is the most important: TE is such a wasteland. The guys around him on the tier are all 2-3 years older and haven't really shown anything themselves. Even if that's due to injury, it's still a cause for concern."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,quickonthedrawl,5,Thu Jul 16 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"The new OC in Tampa runs a te friendly scheme.  Winston targeted his te a bunch in college.  There's the obvious athletic comparables.  And then you have Evans and VJax drawing the coverage on the outside.  Reports from camp have said that he's ""uncoverable""... So you add that up and you get his ADP.  I'm buying.  I think if he can stay healthy, he can be pretty consistent. I wouldn't reach for him, but I think his ADP is justified."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,ookla76,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:38 2015 UTC,"The new OC in Tampa runs a te friendly scheme.   As a Falcons fan I have to caution you, that once Tony G left, we didn't use TE's much at all. This could be because Toilolo sucks, even tho he is 6'8 260(similar to ASJ) or that we had to keep a TE as a blocker a lot with our O-line injuries. In my opinion the coordinator shouldn't be a hype reason for ASJ, at least having had that coordinator on my team."

My point is there are several players that could contend for that #7 spot, and his situation/talent give him enough of a bump to where I could see him being 7a."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,heyfeefellskee,2,Fri Jul 17 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as a rabid UW fan, I was shocked to see the hype he created coming into the league. I get that he has prototypical size, but he rarely ever ""Wowed"" in college, or more accurately, never consistently Wowed. Dude would have one monster game and then blank us for months.   I'm not buying him anywhere, I see the potential, but I'm not buying into that again."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,Cavemansol,2,Thu Jul 16 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"I think with a position like TE in particular, but all positions really, the flashes are as important as consistent production. Especially for someone who is 18, 19, 20 years old."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"For sure, and like I said ""I see the potential""...but I'm just not buying into him specifically after a couple years of the same in Seattle."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,Cavemansol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"The thing here though is that TEs just aren't a used in college like they are in the NFL.  In college, they are mostly small dump offs (and not many), blockers, and sneaky plays that rarely work out too well.  They also aren't developed enough because of these reasons.  When you look at some of the greatest tight ends over the last 10 years, they often came from other positions or even other sports where they learned things such as jumping and boxing out.  Any TE that gets used to an extent where he could have a monster game = potential to be used a lot in the passing game on an NFL team, even if they're just flashes or now-and-then streaks.  A TE that never has a good game and is a blocker 90+% of the time will likely end up in the NFL as a blocker 95+% of the time (or a decoy, or just really low on the QB's progression list).  You mention he has a new quarterback and that being a bad thing.  I see it as only upside!  A new quarterback that is adjusting to the speed of the NFL needs an outlet to dump to, and new quarterbacks that have good situational awareness but are getting blitzed constantly tend to (in my opinion) utilize catching TEs more.  Jameis Winston is one of those quarterbacks ... he's green, but has great awareness in the pocket.  I see him dumping off more than a veteran quarterback, especially in this first year.  What's more, if my prediction is true, then he will get great chemistry going with ASJ (if, in fact, ASJ proves any amount of reliability) ... and this can only bode well for many years of a fantastic duo to develop, perhaps not unlike Rivers and Gates.  I think Winston coming to the team only boosts ASJ's potential, and I value him far more than I did last year (which was only a little, as I had Graham and wasn't doing Dynasty yet)."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,Unpossible42,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:38 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Fractured foot scares me.
DynastyFF,3djfu4,rse77,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to grab ASJ in the 7th or 8th round, as he is often available in start-ups.   You bring up his rookie year as being lackluster, but TEs historically are almost never productive in their rookie year. Not only that, but he was playing injured, with a much worse QB, and on a team that was just entirely a mess. With a rookie TE, you look for flashes that they are able to dominate in the NFL. There were times when ASJ showed that. He certainly showed more than Ebron or Amaro! As others have mentioned, he is massive and has the intangibles to be a serious nfl threat. Add to all this that camp reports have been very positive about him. ""Uncoverable"" was the word used. Obviously camp noise isn't all that important, but it is a positive sign. I don't think he'll be a top 5 TE this year, but I think he has the potential to get there soon enough. In the current state of TEs, that is a shot I am definitely willing to take."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,thewhatwhatbutt,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"Since most of this thread is pro-ASJ I figure I'll be the devil's advocate. I don't actually dislike ASJ, but I do think there is an unfounded hype train surrounding him and he should be lower.   Main point: Almost everyone I see claims that ASJ had the best rookie season of the TEs. However, Jace Amaro did. In their first 9 games (the amount ASJ played in the season), Amaro posted 285 yds and 2 TDs. ASJ posted 221 yds and 2 TDs. In my opinion, being able to stay healthy is also a skill. Amaro played 5 more games than ASJ and as a result posted 345 and 2 TDs on the season.  They were drafted in the same round, a dozen picks apart, giving them the same pedigree. They both played on terrible teams with terrible QBs and poor organizations. As far as isolating variables, it doesn't get much better than this. With situation being very similar, Amaro produced more. Hopefully people will take this to heart and reevaluate ASJ with the hype train goggles off!"
DynastyFF,3djfu4,udeuce,2,Thu Jul 16 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. And after everyone here is saying big, tall, athletic as their reasoning, I'm even more skeptical. I feel like that description matches to nearly every TE. But that doesn't mean you know how to sit in the soft spot of zone coverage, or make that catch over the top. I'm with you, I don't think he can outlive his current hype."
DynastyFF,3djfu4,aussiemac24,2,Fri Jul 17 02:06:45 2015 UTC,"I did a piece on 5 tight ends I projected to break loose in 2015 and wrote this on ASJ:   Take one look at Austin Seferian-Jenkins' towering 6' 5, 262 pound frame and a peek at his measurables which include his 4.56 40-yard speed, and it's easy to see why time and again analysts were predicting big things out of the Bucs rookie tight end last season.  But in an offense marred by sub-par quarterback play, Seferian-Jenkins failed to live up to the hype, mustering just 21 receptions for 221 yards and 2 touchdowns last year.  Now, coming into the 2015 season reportedly at full health, the former John Mackey award winner is set to prove that his rookie year was more aberration than reality. Indeed, it sounds as if Seferian-Jenkins is already off to a hot start as PewterReport.com’s Mark Cook has said Seferian-Jenkins has been ""virtually uncoverable"" in OTAs and mini-camp.  It also certainly helps that Jameis Winston, who I and others have compared to Ben Roethlisberger, will be the one throwing the ball to him this upcoming year. Sporting an impressive 66.0% completion rate at Florida State, Winston targeted his tight end a nation-leading 73 times in his final season in college.  And with new offensive Dirk Koetter in town -- the same man whose play calling funneled 122 targets a season to Tony Gonzalez in his final two years in the league -- it's looking more and more likely that Austin Seferian-Jenkins will play a huge role in the Bucs game plan and have plenty of chances at redemption in 2015."

Not only is ESPN more rigid in how you can customize your league, which is limits how unique your league can be, you also have to deal with not having one access to a source that provides one of the best things about Dynasty:  the ability to keep playing fantasy football all year long.  Sure, maybe not actual games, but adjusting your roster and making trades and doing analysis.  ESPN will be down, offline, not working correctly, locked rosters, etc.  I'm pretty sure I have a free FleaFlicker league set up ... not sure why you'd HAVE to pay money for it.  Are you sure you have pay for it?  (I know there are more advanced settings you can use for payment, but there should be free ones, too).

But then the gap between FF and ESPN is just about as big, too.  The only thing that ESPN truly has going for it is the cell phone app.  Everything is just skin-deep, imo.  I would really consider sticking with FF or at least trying just ONE year of MFL.  Tell your league is just one year, and if they don't think it's awesome you can go back to FF or try ESPN the following year.  I have a feeling most of your people would be willing to pay a mere $7 to stay with MFL.  Just as a reference, I'm coming from ESPN and as a startup dynasty league I made our league on FF ... and then checked out MFL and decided that, as the commish, I would pay for the first year to be on MFL because I know the owners wouldn't want to pay for it.

That being said no f#&*ing way that's even close to fair."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,MrCarlosDanger,3,Thu Jul 16 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, you should deal with it, since unless you can prove it's collusion, you can't/shouldn't do anything about it.   In terms of value and incentive to trade, the first team clearly has plenty of RBs, even if you think Foster and Forte are too old. Cruz and Marshall are clear improvements on Kearse and Hester, and Romo is at least a short-term improvement on Manuel and Kaepernick (with Cutler being a wild-card). I'm not the biggest on Romo, but I understand it.   Brandon Marshall deserves some additional discussion, because I believe you may be selling him way short. The dude has had 7 of his 9 seasons in the league go over 1000 yards (and with 3 different teams). He's still only 31. Jerry Rice made the Pro-Bowl at 40. It's certainly plausible for Marshall to rack up another 5 Pro-Bowl seasons, and depending on how many WRs you can start, Marshall may be a huge improvement on guys like DJax and Stills.   Now, I imagine you agree that this trade makes plenty of sense for the second team (as much as you might dislike that dude getting a stud RB to complement his stud WRs and QBs), so I think there's not much to argue there.   In terms of the first team valuing Gurley, remember again that he has plenty of other RBs, whether you believe in their promise or not. Then you remember that Gurley is coming off an ACL tear, and you think he's over-hyped (for being a RB who hasn't played a snap in the NFL yet), and it makes plenty of sense why somebody might like the Marshall side more.   tl;dr: I wouldn't be the team trading away Gurley here, but it is certainly a viable strategy"
DynastyFF,3djvj8,umaro900,3,Thu Jul 16 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"This is all very reasonable.  The one part that would trip me up however is that, presumably, the team also drafted Gurley with the 1.01 or 1.02 or thereabouts, and it was probably somewhat recently.  Of course it doesn't matter, since OP needs to just accept that some trades will be made that he won't agree with!"
DynastyFF,3djvj8,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"Yea, the point about where he must have drafted Gurley is a bit of a hang-up. There's a few ways I can rationalize this, though:    He was a pick in the middle of the pack and he got Gurley because there was a rush on WRs.  People have different ideas of the value of (1st round) rookies. On one end you can value them as players who have a ~30% chance of becoming studs. On the other end you can value them as studs who have their entire careers ahead of them. The first notion there clearly favors the Marshall side.  If he had the 1.01 pick, he might not have been the sharpest player in the league in the first place."

DynastyFF,3djvj8,productofnoise,2,Thu Jul 16 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"This statement isn't entirely true... The predraft offer from you for pick 1.4 was as follows: Adrian Peterson and 1.4 for Jeremy Maclin, Justin Forsett, and Matt Forte... just wanted some honesty here...  For the record, I made the above trade because I felt my window for a playoff/championship run has a window of three years... I took over this team last year when the owner dropped out after the draft, and then I got blindsided by AD's suspension, Zac Stacy's demotion, and WR injuries that plagued the team... I was able to pick up some decent waiver wire players and was able to keep myself out of the basement last year... Besides the Gurley pick this year, I also was able to draft Jaelen Strong, Devin Smith, and Justin Hardy to stash until they start to contribute... I also traded AD and a third next year for Forte and Jeremy Langford, with hopes that Langford will be the successor in Chi-town...  As for the trade today, my QB situation was treacherous... Kaep and Cutler are ???s, both in new offensive schemes... Romo, IMO, will likely be passing more with the loss of Demarco and I am predicting a jump back into the top 7 or 8 in QB points for him. Hopefully, he has 3 to 5 years left at that rate of play... Marshall, I feel, is better than any starting WR I have and still has alot of football ahead of him... I took Cruz over a 3rd rounder next year because I think his value will spike once he proves he is healthy. His numbers should improve with Beckham taking the top off and giving him more room in the slot. He will primarily be a bye week replacement, and/or trade bait... I, too, am a huge Gurley fan (I am from GA and UGA is my favorite college team). Getting him at 1.4 was a huge coup, but there are question marks too. Will he be ready at start of season, will he split carries with Mason, will he be the same back he was in college?? Honestly, coming off that ACL injury, who knows... I got value I found sufficient that could put me into the playoffs this year and hopefully a couple years down the road... I plan on drafting for Foster's replacement next year, as I potentially have Forte's replacement in Langford... I understand most people wouldn't make this trade, but I chose not to be a middling team this year..."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,blardorg,2,Fri Jul 17 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as long as you have some rationale and plan, even a trade that most think isn't great can still help you. The only thing I would caution you about is that you seem to be leaving a good bit of value on the table. Gurley should've been able to bring you back better assets, and that AP for Forte/Langford was selling AP for lower than you could have.   You don't have to agree with consensus valuations of players of course, and if you're not a huge Gurley fan, definitely move him. But you should use those consensus valuations to try to maximize how much you get in return. I.e., even if you think Gurley is going to bust, you don't sell him for a ham sandwich, you sell him as if he's going to put up AP numbers for the next 8 years, because that's how other people value him!"
DynastyFF,3djvj8,productofnoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"My original targets when trying to trade with the OP were Nelson and Russell Wilson... I started to feel like I was losing significant value in trade negotiations with the OP when I offered Gurley, Kaep, Keenan Allen, and Jarvis Landry for Wilson, Nelson, Maclin, and Spiller... I left that trade on the table for 12 + hours, even though I felt my team would still be a middling team after losing Allen and Landry... Yes, there is value left on the table when it comes to youth and upside, but I feel the addition of the three starters I trade for has me competitive this year and a few years to come... This is a PPR league the ability to start 4 WRs... Upgrading WRs was a major selling point of this trade..."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,blardorg,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is value left on the table when it comes to youth and upside, but I feel the addition of the three starters I trade for has me competitive this year and a few years to come   Not sure if I wasn't clear or you missed my point. I wasn't criticizing you for trading youth for production now, that's not what I meant by leaving value on the table. I was saying you likely could've gotten better players for what you gave up. Marshall and Cruz help your roster, sure, but you could've potentially gotten something better. Calvin + a QB, Tate + Sanders, Edelman + DJax, etc etc. Don't settle for a deal just because it helps you if it isn't maximizing what you could be getting! That's what I meant. Yes improving your WRs was essential, but you might have been able to improve them even more :)"

DynastyFF,3djvj8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"I don't plan on not dealing with it. This whole post was just to get a general consensus on whether or not the trade was fair. I appreciate you playing devil's advocate and here is my response:  Can you tell me, with a straight face, that this lineup:  QB: Romo RB: Foster, Forte WR: Landry, Allen, Marshall, Cruz  is better than this one, both looking to the future and competing within the next 2 years:  QB: Kaep/Cutler RB: Gurley, Foster, Forte WR: Landry, Allen, Djax"
DynastyFF,3djvj8,umaro900,6,Thu Jul 16 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"Actually yes, lineup A probably wins more games in 2015 and is close in 2016."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Looking to the future, lineup A is older and without a decent RB. Lineup B has arguably the best RB prospect in the last decade. In the present, Lineup A starts the bare minimum RB and both are older/injury prone. WR3 and WR4 (Marshall and Cruz) are playing in a Jets uniform after a season of foot injuries and coming off a destroyed knee respectively. Gurley's knee is bum too and I get that but he's got all the upside in the world.  OP accepts that trades will be made but OP also believes there's nothing wrong with speaking up and saying ""this trade is lopsided"" and at least giving his league proof that it isn't just his opinion, by linking to this thread. Especially when the Gurley receiver tries to justify that it's even.  Talking in 3rd person is weird."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,mzkp54,2,Thu Jul 16 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"You can disagree all you want, but it's not going to change my assessment that Team A has an edge in 2015 and is almost as good in 2016!  I'm a huge fan of Gurley too, but like umaro said, writing off Marshall as dead is not right, and Gurley might not even get going until well into 2015 or even 2016.  Simply put, the trade is bad, but it's not that bad that it's worth throwing a fit over. If instead of Gurley it was the 1.04 predraft, it wouldn't be anywhere near this concerning."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,aussiemac24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:08:30 2015 UTC,"Well, he still has Cutler and DJax, so I wouldn't be throwing them out of the lineup discussion (lets you play match-ups and have insurance).   For this year, Gurley is going to be eased back into the game. Mason is more than competent enough to handle a starting role for now. On these grounds I believe that there is a very good chance that his team is in better shape to compete this year.   I don't believe it makes him stronger in year 2, but it's still defensible to believe that, and it could be irrelevant for his strategy. Gurley being taken at 1.04 isn't an overwhelming show of confidence in the dude, and his attempting to trade for Nelson beforehand is about as much proof as I'd ever need to know that it wasn't collusion.   In another response I said a point which I believe is very relevant to this evaluation:    People have different ideas of the value of (1st round) rookies. On one end you can value them as players who have a ~30% chance of becoming studs. On the other end you can value them as studs who have their entire careers ahead of them. The first notion there clearly favors the Marshall side.    It's all a matter of perspective. I understand your gripe, but if you are unable to let things like this slide, I don't think this is necessarily the league you want to be in."
DynastyFF,3djvj8,chiefst,2,Thu Jul 16 23:12:26 2015 UTC,"Not even remotely close to Gurley's value. Very definition of a ""trash for treasure"" trade."

DynastyFF,3djvj8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the trade is certainly unbalanced. However, if you feel that there isn't any collusion going on, I don't know that it's grounds for veto. Just because you wish you had made the trade for Gurley doesn't mean it's right to ruin the trade already in progress."

DynastyFF,3dl58t,onyx11,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:05 2015 UTC,Waiver wire is empty so if you're looking for development only young buy low(ish) qb is bortles.
DynastyFF,3dl58t,chkessle,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"Too many RB, not enough WR.  That is the worst thing I have to say.  The second worst thing is your QB may not be good enough to get you to the championships in 2015.  With Palmer facing injury questions and Brady maybe facing suspension I think you should keep your eye on waiver wire in case you have to make a quick pickup at QB2.  Good team overall.  With good management of lineup/waiver wire/trades you should be in the thick of the playoffs. I think you may need to grab some older WR to help but they should be cheap."
DynastyFF,3dl58t,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:21:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was tough. Everyone was taking Wrs so early, and RBs were just sitting there for so long, eventually i just gave in. Thanks, and I will definitely look for an extra QB...try to grab backups during injuries."
DynastyFF,3dl58t,aussiemac24,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"I think you did really well. You're very balanced as a result of punting on the QB a bit. Your team looks like it could be set up to win now and for the future. Sucks you didn't get Rawls since you're trying to own the future Seahawk RB.   Only comment I'd say, is that trying to handcuff all of these backfields can be challenging with roster management."
DynastyFF,3dl58t,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:25:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yeah I know Rawls went first out of all the backups. Can you elaborate on your second point? Sorry, just got a little confused."
DynastyFF,3dl58t,username02,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"Essentially, 1 RB takes up 2-3 roster spots. It can be frustrating because it takes up so much space on a limited roster, especially when a new face (Rawls) comes in and takes someone's spot. While it usually (not always), guarantees the backfield, it comes at the expense of being able to dynamically play the waiver wire. Although, it depends on how many roster spots are allowed in your league."

Two elite players? AP and T.Y. but for 2QB league your stable is soft Tannehill is still unproven, Eli? Or Peyton? Eli is solid, Peyton is in a run heavy system along with Smith and Ryan.  AP/McKinnon is solid, hoping for the best with rest. T.Y. is money but no solid WR2,. Two solid TE, but never flex two TE unless you have Graham/Gronk combo.

He's in an offense that spreads targets around and is on the last year of his deal. I don't think he qualifies as elite for this reasons.

DynastyFF,3dl0x1,Crimson-Chin,3,Fri Jul 17 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I would do this trade. Ingram will probably have a pretty good year but you're doing this trade for the long haul. Whoever you pick with all these picks should be around for a few years. If I were you. I would go Gurley, Yeldon and then Devante Parker.  Gotta imagine KWhite would go at 1.05 but I'm not a big fan of him anyway. I think he has bust written all over him."
DynastyFF,3dl0x1,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I normally would not reach for Yeldon, and draft BPA, but I feel like Kevin White, Parker, and Agoholor are all a gamble, so why not fill a need, then grab whoever drops. I actually feel that Agholor is the safe pick that could be a flex or maybe a WR2 for years, and White and Parker have boom or bust potential.  Why do you feel White has bust written all over him? I have similar feelings about Parker. Reports at the draft were that a lot of teams were questioning his desire for the game."
DynastyFF,3dl0x1,Santidreet,2,Fri Jul 17 07:03:35 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern with White is that he's one of those guys who's draft stock was only so high because of the combine. He killed it at the combine, enough that a lot of people were considering him over Cooper. His speed and strength won't let him dominate in the NFL like he did in college. At WVU, he was the most athletic guy on the field at all times. I'm concerned he doesn't have the route running, and football IQ to succeed in the NFL. I don't see him being a total bust but I don't think he'll be a star. And I definitely don't see him producing early."
DynastyFF,3dl0x1,Cavemansol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:14:08 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with the analysis of White, and when you couple all that with the fact that he only ever had ONE dominate year in college, he starts sounding alot more like DGB than Cooper."
DynastyFF,3dl0x1,Swisscheese1021,2,Fri Jul 17 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"I would accept that trade mostly due to the addition of Spiller who will start as the third down back but will continue to add to his touches as the season rolls along. As most people on here will tell you, always take BPA. That would mean taking white and risking TJ gets taken. You can find someone who is in love with White willing to give up more than TJ. Even if you don't trade, a 1-2 of Leveon and the rams backfield will be very good this year and Randle could win that coveted Cowboys backfield."
DynastyFF,3dl0x1,Swisscheese1021,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats where im leaning. I just think that Ingram's value is probably the highest it ever will be right now, and its a good time to sell.  Definitely agree with BPA in the draft, just wondering if there is a case like this that you might break the rule, where you have one pick in between yours and arent in love with one WR in particular. (White, Parker, Agholor) So you let someone make that decision easier for you and fill a need with a hope to be, solid RB in Yeldon.  I guess part of me is worried about KWhite and Alshon having to share receptions on my team, but then again, if KWhite puts up BMarshall numbers it wouldnt really matter."
DynastyFF,3dl0x1,username02,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:07:49 2015 UTC,"If you view those three receivers as very close in value and see a large drop off in value behind TJ, then yeah i would say take TJ and whoever falls to you.

WHS didn't do as well in the combine, but his experience and attitude put him in a position for his team's MVP."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,Unpossible42,3,Thu Jul 16 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"Julio vs Dez - Focal point of the offense and can beat the coverage thrown at him Hill vs McCoy - McCoy is older, but I don't think he comes off the field. He can do enough by himself to make it work Kelvin Benjamin vs Jordan Matthews - should see a lot of volume from the slot and is a good red zone target. I think Kelvin will be more TD dependent Cooks vs Watkins - such a better situation. QB can make such a difference Arob vs Kevin White - I know everyone loves Arob, but that situation is pretty terrible. With the weapons in Chi, I think White could see a lot of single coverage Nelson Agholor vs Keenan Allen - I think he bounces back this year and regains the rookie form Breshad Perriman vs Jarvis Landry - He can catch Micheal Floyd vs Dorial Green Beckham - So many uncertainties with DGB. He has a higher ceiling, but you could alos end up with 2 points every week John Brown vs Cody Latimer - With the offense, I think he had a clearer path to playing time. Latimer would need an injury to contribute ASJ vs Tyler Eifert - Tons of talent and a huge upgrade at QB Eli Manning vs Joe Flacco - hard not to like the guy with OBJ Cordarrelle Patterson vs A Warm Ham Sandwich  - I don't think the sandwich has the frame to stay healthy all season. Patterson has been bad, but I'll take the guy that is at least on the field and not in B.J. Raji's stomach"
DynastyFF,3diyfs,urfrendlipiro,3,Thu Jul 16 18:58:45 2015 UTC,Dez. Less injury prone.   Hill due only to youth  Matthews by a lot.   Cooks due to Rex Ground n pound offense  AROB  Both.  I have to choose one? Ummm....Allen?  Landry because he's a known commodity.   Floyd by a lot   Latimer due only to youth  ASJ  Flacco  Sammich plz!
DynastyFF,3diyfs,chkessle,3,Thu Jul 16 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"Julio vs Dez:  Dez More consistent and a TD machine. I am a falcons fan but give me Dez. Hill vs McCoy: Hill I don't really like McCoy in Buffalo, plus he didn't do to well last year. Maybe my recency bias is too high but I like Hill. Kelvin Benjamin vs Jordan Matthews: Matthews, he is younger and better IMO. Cooks vs Watkins: Cooks while he doesn't have the talent of Watkins, he is still very good and in a great situation. Arob vs Kevin White: Arob I really wasn't the biggest K. White fan on tape and I like what A-Rob has done so far and the reports from the offseason. Nelson Agholor vs Kennan Allen: Allen his down year had 77 catches in 14 games. Oh and he's still only 23. Breshad Perriman vs Jarvis Landry: Perriman has more upside and I worry that Parker will take Landrys targets. Micheal Floyd vs Dorial Green Beckham: DGB, Floyd really has amounted to anything so I don't know if I am holding out hope anymore. John Brown vs Cody Latimer: Latimer, although I like Brown, he is the second/third option on not the best passing team and he is aready 25. ASJ vs Tyler Eifert: I really know nothing about either. Eli Manning vs Joe Flacco: Flacco is my QB in all my dynasty leagues. At only 30 he is one of the best priced options by far. He will play 5+ more seasons for sure, and although he may never be the best he can consistently put up low QB1/ high QB2 numbers which is huge at the price you get him at. Plus, they added two weapons for him with their top 2 picks. Cordarrelle Patterson vs A Warm Ham Sandwich: CP, maybe if it was turkey or chicken...i just really don't like ham. Not enough upside."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,PaoloPWD,3,Thu Jul 16 20:24:02 2015 UTC,Dude you're so right ham has really limited upside. I'm not even joking. Ham is just ham.

DynastyFF,3diyfs,elwooko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"I am going to have to disagree with the limited upside of a warm ham sandwich. Sure last season was a down year (white bread, American cheese, warmed in a microwave) but I am really liking the offseason workouts upgrading to a toaster oven and adding a fried egg.   Just think of the possibilities when it gets to Gruyere and a thick crusty French bread. You are really underselling the sandwich here. I'm thinking late first round upside."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,He_who_knows_little,5,Fri Jul 17 12:54:52 2015 UTC,"Julio vs Dez - I know he just got $$$ but he is still a diva and Julio will prolly get more next year (Like actually more not just more because the cap goes up every year). I like Ryan better than Romo especially with his back issues. Julio just seems more dominant to me.  Hill vs McCoy - Sure he is a bit older, but he is going to thrive in Buf. The thing im worried about Hill is a little man named Gio Bernard. McCoy will be getting all of the touches. He also has a good 4-5 years left in the league. I'm cool with that.   Kelvin Benjamin vs Jordan Matthews - Closer than everyone is going to say. KB dominated last year and still dropped a ton of passes. I would have loved for them to grab a smaller guy to give KB room to work (Looking at you Lockett) but Funchess is the next big thing. I think the issue (was last year) its hard to predict TD's for him. Cam can always run it in and now there is another huge target. Jmatt is likely remaining in the slot for most of his snaps (92% last year!!) and that's awesome for him. I love him in PPR and I think Agholor only helps his production.   Cooks vs Watkins - Another close one for me (hey who wrote these!) Maybe its not that close the more I think about. Watkins is twice as talented (sorry Drew) but he is getting thrown to by a wet dog (Cassel) or an even wetter dog from the wrong side of the proverbial football tracks (Manuel). I think he still excels but for PPR Cooks will be right on his tail. Watkins easily has the better career, Cooks dosent disappoint.   Arob vs Kevin White - I guess no contest for me here. White has similar if not more upside, but I like what I've seen from Arob. Brace yourselves for this next take, Bortles >> Cutler. There I said it.   Nelson Agholor vs Kennan Allen - No comment. Search my comment history for the Agholor love. He is Maclin but younger and more willing to do his job.   Breshad Perriman vs Jarvis Landry - I love me some juice!   Micheal Floyd vs Dorial Green Beckham - I'll be interested to see how this one turns out. Floyd only really lost a little love from me last season. I didnt buy into him at his insane value, but I think he meets a better expectation this year with a real QB (read: not Ryan Lindley) Hopefully Palmer(only 33 people) makes it through the year. Imo a great buy low. DGB has much higher upside but is limited by Marriota...need to see more here   John Brown vs Cody Latimer - Not close for me.   ASJ vs Tyler Eifert - A lot closer than I thought when writing this one. ASJ is fucking poised for a great career, but will Winston be the one to get him there?  Eli Manning vs Joe Flacco - Top 10 Fantasy QB right here.  Cordarrelle Patterson vs A Warm Ham Sandwich - Only if the sandwich has mayo and some provolone...maybe a tomato."

DynastyFF,3diyfs,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 19:16:14 2015 UTC,"Only one I disagreed with his Hill vs McCoy.   I think Hill and Gio will be able to co-exist. The Bengals should be a pretty good offense this year and Hill is going to get a lot of goal line looks. He was the best back in the NFL last year in the second half. A bunch of those games were with Gio.   As a Jets fan, I know what a lack of a pass attack can do to an offense. McCoy will be looking at 8 men in the box all damn year. Unless the Bills somehow figure out their QB situation, I think McCoy's gonna be limited. He'll get a good amount of carries but with an average o-line and all the defenses attention, I don't think he'll put up big numbers."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,m_plis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"I agree on all of these except McCoy. I think McCoy will be good but i think he and Hill will have the same production, and thus it comes down to years and Hill has more."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"Julio. Flip a coin really.  Hill. Lower mileage, and it doesn't come at a huge cost to current production.  Matthews. Fewer question marks, better skill set IMO.  Watkins. Cooks is going to have the same QB question marks in a couple years. Really wish we had one extra year of data on Watkins...  Robinson. Mancrush. Dude will be a stud. His metrics were insane last year.  Agholor. Not sure on this one. I'd rather have the unknown guy at this point, not a fan of Allen's game.  Landry for a competitor, Perriman for a rebuild. Pretty self explanatory. Not sure that Landry has room to grow, and not sure how long-term his production will be. Perriman has a sky high ceiling but a floor in the basement.  Floyd. Still young enough that I'll take his prior NFL experience over a late first rounder with character concerns.  Brown. Could probably flip a coin with these two also but Brown showed enough last year.  ASJ. Mancrush part deaux. I own roughly a million shares.  Manning. Betting on him big this year. Probably would take Flacco in a 2QB where I didn't want to shop in 2 years though.  Patterson. Make it a reuben instead and it would be a landslide the other way."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,boredatworkbored,2,Thu Jul 16 17:56:36 2015 UTC,I would even take a Rachel by a landslide :P
DynastyFF,3diyfs,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of reasons for picking Watkins over Cooks and I realize that those also factor into your pick, but the argument against Cooks that you mentioned seems a little weak.  Yeah Cooks might have a dicey QB situation at some point, but we don't know when or even if that'll happen and we don't know what's going to change between now and then. Maybe Garrett Grayson is the next coming of Peyton Manning. Maybe Buffalo pulls a Cleveland and spends years trying to fix their QB situation. Maybe Cooks proves to be a transcendent talent. Maybe Watkins doesn't progress as a player.   We have a hard enough time predicting what's going to happen from one week to the next, let alone 2-3 years down the road, so it's tough for me to hold Cooks' hypothetical future QB situation against him."
DynastyFF,3diyfs,zjhaynes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"Oh that wasn't an argument against Cooks, FWIW. I think the kid is a fine buy right now. I was just trying to head off the QB argument against Watkins before it was made. :)"
DynastyFF,3diyfs,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"Julio vs Dez - Health and locked up situation concerns tilt it in his favor  Hill vs McCoy- Not convinced McCoy isn't on the decline. He relies on his shiftiness since he smaller and maybe it's fading  Kelvin Benjamin vs Jordan Matthews- Pretty even imo, but the dude's insance catch radius/hand size allows him to do things NO ONE else can do. He'll be incredible if he can master the fundamentals  Cooks vs Watkins- Cooks will have a better year thanks to situation, maybe 2, but Watkins talent is upper tier. I'm thinking Julio vs. TY here  Arob vs Kevin White- Draw... I'm actually avoiding both at their current ADP, one of them will be way cheaper next year. I'm not sold on either  Nelson Agholor vs Kennan Allen- I'm not an Allen believer  Breshad Perriman vs Jarvis Landry- His upside is so much higher than people are giving him credit for and that's what I aim for in drafts... Landry has a safer floor, but is a career WR2 in Miami  Micheal Floyd vs Dorial Green Beckham- Draw... neither excite me. Floyd if a gun is to my head  John Brown vs Cody Latimer- More upside and more talent imo  ASJ vs Tyler Eifert- but this could easily go the other way after this season  Eli Manning vs Joe Flacco- I just don't like Flacco. I don't even have a good reason  Cordarrelle Patterson vs A Warm Ham Sandwich- but only because it's lunch time. In an hour I'll have buyers remorse"

I'm not sold on either   Thats interesting. I would say BOTH will be more expensive next year. If ARob is the second coming like MANY are calling his price explodes. If White gets on the field half way through the season and shows half his potential his price explodes also.    In an hour I'll have buyers remorse   Lmao"
DynastyFF,3diyfs,iRavage,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:51 2015 UTC,Ugh I'm half expecting Robinson to be a top 5 startup pick next year. I'm only half kidding too. Really expect him to be at least an early second rounder.

DynastyFF,3diyfs,umaro900,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"On 2nd thought I'll give the edge to ARob. His value is more insulated because even though Jacksonville is bad they're improving slowly so people will give him the benefit of the doubt if he has a mediocre year (which I think is likely). There will be bust talk that will factor into his ADP next year if White under-performs and the Cutler situation scares me. It also woudn't surprise me if you're right though, but there's less risky options at their ADPs I'd rather target."

Jmatt for me. Both have incoming rookies to help cut into the pie but maclin leaving leaves more pie. And I'm not a KB fan.  I like Watkins God given measurables. Taking him over cooks only based on talent and he has the size. But cooks will get his.   I think most people will go Arob here but I'm going white bc I like his ceiling. Just my peference.   Agholor for scheme and he should see volume early and often. #culture  Perriman for measurables. Height and speed. Can learn to concentrate?  Floyd over DGB. Holding out hope is all here.   Brown bc I think he will put it together. Latimer work ethic scares me off.   ASJ bc that size doe.  Eli. Why not.   Cpatt cuz I'm full from lunch"
DynastyFF,3diyfs,username02,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"Julio - Better, younger, and healthier QB. PPR. I feel that Julio has more ability for consistency and upside if/when he's healthy; if he's in the game, he's getting more targets, receptions, and yards than Dez. Julio's health is the only reason I'd go with Dez here, but when Julio is out you can start somebody else.   Hill - His who he was at the end of last season, and although he has Gio around, he's a better talent and the starting role is his to lose. McCoy has a starting role in Buffalo for now, but I'm not convinced in the coaches, GM, or QB around him. He also played poorly last season not just for injury to him or his O-line.   Matthews - I'm not entirely sold on either, but I like what Matthews brings to the table more than Benjamin, and the team/QB situation is better (for a receiver).   Watkins - He's a better talent, and even though I believe that the entire Buffalo situation is a train-wreck, they are transparent in their desire to feed Sammy the rock and build the offense around him.   White - Robinson will certainly be better this year, but White is the superior talent, and the order of succession is clearer. I'm also not entirely sure that Bortles and the Jaguars will be able to really allow Robinson to thrive. You can bemoan the presence of Jeffery and Cutler on the Bears, but remember that Marshall and Jeffery both combined for 2716 yards in 2013 and Cutler chucking the rock. There is more than enough volume available to believe in White's ceiling.   Agholor - This is much closer than one might think, despite my clear love for Agholor. Allen is underrated right now because he had a down year. I have full confidence that he will be able to pick it up again once a healthy running game takes some of the pressure off him. It's tempting to side with Allen here simply because he has already shown it in the league, but Chip Kelly and Agholor are easier to root for.   Landry - He's practically Anquan Boldin at age 22. Perriman is practically DHB at age 21. PPR.  Floyd - I don't believe in DGB any more than Perriman, especially with Wright and McBride simply being better receivers IMO. Floyd is in a similar situation to Allen. With a healthy Palmer and a bit of focus, he'll be back in ascendant form.   Latimer - I don't think Brown is better than Fitz or Floyd, and Latimer was only side-lined because of Fox. He has the talent to succeed, and I believe there will be enough volume to go around as long as Peyton is on the team. Afterwards, Elway will find another QB, assuming it isn't Brock Lobster.   ASJ - He has shown a little more in his time with the team, and I feel like he is more needed as a receiver than with Eifert, not to mention I believe Winston>Dalton. Bengals have more versatile receivers in Green, Sanu, Jones, and Bernard. VJax and Evans are more like Marshall and Jeffery were with the Bears.   Eli ""2SB"" Manning - McAdoo and Beckham came to town last year and it's a lot harder to fuck up now. Flacco got DHB 2.0 this year after losing Torrey Smith.   Cordarelle Patterson - I would have gone for a cold ham sandwich, but it being warm just gives me some weird vibe. I feel like ham shouldn't be warm. Patterson can probably be sold for a throwaway pick, at least. Besides, if you've got a deep enough roster, maybe there's a chance he actually learns some basic routes."

DynastyFF,3diyfs,afterthegame,2,Thu Jul 16 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"Julio vs Dez - I think Dallas gets more pass happy with Murray gone and Falcons get more run focused with Shanahan.    Hill vs McCoy - Hill I think will split duties still vs McCoy getting more work in the passing game. Rushing it's a draw but McCoy gets it with his ability to get in space on screens  Kelvin Benjamin vs Jordan Matthews - More snaps and more explosive offense. Murray will open up the middle of the field more on PA now too.  Cooks vs Watkins - Solely because PPR. I could see Cooks averaging 10 receptions this year with none being downfield. I see them having similar yards, but Cooks getting 20-30 more touches. Plus some reverse rushing yds.  Arob vs Kevin White - I want to say White here (I own him) but Arob was insane to start the year. Plus, is it bad that I have more faith in Bortles than Cutler??  Nelson Agholor vs Kennan Allen - I see Agholor getting close to Maclin's numbers and Chargers riding Gordon  Breshad Perriman vs Jarvis Landry - I really see Perriman struggling. I won't be shocked when he's a WR4. Worst hands + Strongest Arm = Drops  Micheal Floyd vs Dorial Green Beckham - It seems as though the Floyd Hypetrain/Bandwagon is officially empty? As tall as DGB is, I see him struggling with physicality of NFL.  John Brown vs Cody Latimer - I find this group the toughest. I'm not high on either one because I just don't think there is enough ball to share. I only say Cody because Peyton has shown he can create enough points to share with everyone moreso than the Palmer/Arizona offense mindset.  ASJ vs Tyler Eifert - Jameis loves him some tight end... and crab legs  Eli Manning vs Joe Flacco - OBJ vs Steve Smith and a bunch of scrubs  Cordarrelle Patterson vs A Warm Ham Sandwich - wildcard... Ravens or Saints trade for him.  Fun list!"

DynastyFF,3diyfs,camomilk,2,Thu Jul 16 22:07:19 2015 UTC,"Julio vs Dez  This is pretty much a toss up, but I like Julio just a little bit more, since i feel like Ryan will be a good Qb for longer than Romo will  Hill vs McCoy  Yes, Hill has to deal with Bernard, but he's still going to get the majority of the touches. McCoy wasn't particularly effective last year with a very good but banged up O-Line, now he has one of the worst, on an absolutely terrible team with no QB and an offensive coordinator who doesn't throw to his RBs.  Kelvin Benjamin vs Jordan Matthews  Most of Benjamin's production last year came in garbage time, and he dropped a ton of passes. The addition of Funchess and him showing up to training camp out of shape doesn't give me much hope that he will improve on last season's numbers. Matthews is going to be a PPR machine in the slot in Chip Kelly's offense, he may not have many TDs, but he's going to have a ton of receptions.  Cooks vs Watkins  This one is really tough. Watkins is no doubt more talented, but in an awful situation, while Cooks is in a very favorable one. If you need a WR to help you compete now I'd probably go with Cooks over Watkins, but long term Watkins is more valuable.  Arob vs Kevin White   This is only really because we've seen what Robinson can do, while we still have no idea how White is going to transition to the NFL. ARob's ceiling may be a little lower, but his floor is WAY higher.  Nelson Agholor vs Kennan Allen  Same reasoning as ARob over White, We've seen what Allen can do, and even though he dropped a bit last year I bet he rebounds and has a very nice year.  Breshad Perriman vs Jarvis Landry  Again, more of the fact that we have seen Landry do well in the NFL, but I'm also not completely sold on Perriman. I feel like he rose a lot because of his combine performance, and I'm wary of players who rise because of a fast 40 time.   Micheal Floyd vs Dorial Green Beckham  I just can't quit Floyd. I still think he has the ability to be a very good WR, but if he doesn't do anything this year then I'm getting off the train. DGb is also the biggest question mark of all the top rookie WRs, and is not in a great situation.  John Brown vs Cody Latimer  I really like Brown, he was very good last year, and he's been living and training with Palmer this year. Latimer has barely seen the field, was reportedly unmotivated last year, and is now 3rd on the depth chart on a team with a coach who primarily uses 2 WR sets. It could be another couple of years before you even know what you have in Latimer.  ASJ vs Tyler Eifer  A close one, but I think Eifert is slightly more talented and in a better situation.  Eli Manning vs Joe Flacco  Eli improved greatly over the course of the season last year as he gained more comfort in McAdoo's system, and as OBJ came on. They've got a pretty good offense developing there, and if Cruz manages to come back strong Eli is going to put up a ton of points.  Cordarrelle Patterson vs A Warm Ham Sandwich  This one really depends, does the sandwich have mayo or mustard on it?"
DynastyFF,3dk4zw,darkforce547,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"Developmental guys... cut out Bailey and Crabtree from the top list and add Bell. I'd throw Abbrederis in there but with his injuries it looks more likely that he'll be cut this offseason. I don't really see much coming from Richardson or Matthews, and Washington won't see the field unless there are significant injuries to NYG WRs... he barely saw the field at all last year."
DynastyFF,3dk4zw,dumbname2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"Bailey was definitely the lowest man on the totem pole. I haven't made a move on Crabtree because there's a potential that he only looked bad because Kaep has been terrible. I mean, Boldin hasn't looked great either, and he's a quality receiver.  What's your opinion on Streator? He was injured last year, but very productive in 2013 and when healthy in 2014."
DynastyFF,3dk4zw,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:12:29 2015 UTC,"Those free agents look familiar. :P  With such good options on the wire, I'd start offering up a ""dealer's choice"" among a group of them in exchange for a draft pick. Something like, ""Would you trade your 2nd round pick for your choice of Bailey, Crabtree, Quick, or Jones?"" (or whatever group of fungible receivers you want).  Since you'll be replacing the vacated roster spot with a guy almost as good as a 2nd round anyway, your cost is minimal, and you get to push back your lineup logjam another year at least.  And offering up the choice of guys makes it much more likely to get a deal done at plus value for you, as long as all of them are roughly equivalent values."

DynastyFF,3dk4zw,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"Hah. I know I've said this before, but I love acquiring 2nd rounders. People part with them so much easier than first rounders (and rightly so), but while future firsts tend to be overvalued, seconds seem to be undervalued.  They let you churn your roster more aggressively without always using a roster spot, and you can throw them into package deals a lot more aggressively when you're holding 2-3 at any given time."
DynastyFF,3dk4zw,Swisscheese1021,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"If you're going for long-term WR development, I would personally hold OBJ, Bryant, Quick, Janis, Smelter, and McBride.

Floyd is getting Palmer back with Fitz another year older, also with Brown there to keep the safety back Floyd can get back into developing into the elite reciever he was drafted to be. IMO White will take over as the WR1 in chicago after Alshon struggles this year against the top corners and white puts up great numbers. Rudolph is a homer pick, but he is being looked over way to much. He is still fairly young, very talented, and in an offense with Teddy B."
DynastyFF,3dkshi,Swisscheese1021,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:16:52 2015 UTC,"QB: Tannehill? (I usually punt QB, so it usually ends up being Flacco or Dalton, but if I had my choice I would take Tannehill every draft.    RB: Gordon, Yeldon, L. Murray. I would prefer to have young RBs with some upside. I think this is the group for that. Excluded Gurley because Gurley, Gordon, Yeldon didn't seem feasible.    WR: DeAndre Hopkins, Allen Robinson, Charles Johnson, Tyler Lockett. Nuk is love. Nuk is life. I am buying in to the ARob hype. Charles + Teddy should develop into a nice tandem. I think Lockett can succeed as a chain mover in SEA with Graham there to open up the defense.    TE: Ebron, ASJ, Dwayne Allen. 1 word.... upside."
DynastyFF,3djir8,shack026,7,Thu Jul 16 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Wow that's a good one. Can you turn the screws a little bit more and grab one more prospect, even a low-end one? And are you sure that the first rounder will be a high pick?  I'd be very tempted to take this deal. OBJ won't get any more valuable, but he could get a lot less valuable."
DynastyFF,3djir8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:58 2015 UTC,DAMN QOTD answered my question.  I feel so special :p  I know the guy wants him real bad.  The 1st round pick is actually mine that I traded away in another deal a while back so I can say pretty positively that it will be.  Would you think a 2nd round rookie pick would work out or would you rather get a low end prospect?
DynastyFF,3djir8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"A second rounder is probably preferable if you're in a real rebuild.  If you think that first rounder could be the 1.01-1.03, then that trade works out to be OBJ for ~1.03 (Robinson), ~1.02 (your first rounder), and ~1.08 (Adams). That's fine value to start with.  What I'd try to do is to package OBJ with an older asset that he might want too, and to try and acquire even more younger talent or another future first (even 2017)."
DynastyFF,3djir8,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"Ok so just a little more backround it's a superflex league and he has Peyton and Rodgers but 0 backups.  Where we've gotten to now is from me: OBJ, Geno Smith, and Latavius Murray.    From him: Devante Adams, Allen Robinson, Donte Moncrief, a high 1st next year and a high 2nd next year.    This gets me so much depth I'm super tempted to make this deal."
DynastyFF,3djir8,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 20:12:07 2015 UTC,Can you post his full roster?
DynastyFF,3djir8,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"Happily.  This guy is the far and away leader in our league right now. QB: Peyton, Rodgers  RB: CJ. Anderson, J. Stew, Giovani Bernard, Monte Ball, Pierre Thomas, Khiry Robinson, Lance Dunbar, DeAngelo Williams  WR: AJ Green, Julio, Calvin, Mike Evans, Allen Robinson, Davante Adams, Donte Moncrief  TE: Olsen, Kelce, Housler."
DynastyFF,3djir8,fropek,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"No kidding, that roster is stacked from top to bottom. Unfortunately he doesn't have a lot to offer you outside of what's already in the deal.  Can y'all deal 2017 picks also? Ideally, it would look like Beckham, Geno, and Murray for Robinson, Adams, Moncrief, a 2016 1st, 2016 2nd, and one more pick. Maybe a 2017 2nd? Or drop the 2017 seconds entirely and ask for a 2017 first, especially if it's his first rounder, since it'll be easier for him to part with."
DynastyFF,3djir8,thewhatwhatbutt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice man.  Wasn't able to squeeze anything else out of him but I decided to take the deal.  My roster was so shallow and sad that it needed to happen.

DynastyFF,3djir8,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:38 2015 UTC,I agree with qotd. If you can twist their arm for a little more it won't hurt.

DynastyFF,3dk9f9,PaoloPWD,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:01 2015 UTC,"I get that its 6pts/Passing TD but Jameis over Amari at 1.04 is ridiculous! That guy must've been desperate for a QB... Maybe in a 2QB league but not in a 1QB, 6pt/TD league"
DynastyFF,3dk9f9,maddenite,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, our league seems to greatly overvalue the QB position. I think this owner was set on drafting Winston to eventually take over for Tom Brady, and decided to stick to his plan even after Cooper fell.  To be fair, the team that drafted Russell Wilson in the first round (3rd overall) of our startup last year won it all."
DynastyFF,3dk9f9,Hawxfan,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"Boy, whoever got Amari Cooper at 1.06 must be a genius manager! ;) Honestly, I wouldn't care if I got no one else in the draft, that was my crowning achievement this year. Still kind of in shock about it actually. I was pondering reaching on Winston or Mariota because of my shit QB situation, which is why I made a point to pull off a trade for Tannehill before the draft.  I thought you did a great job in your draft as well and really liked the trade you pulled off for 1.01. Would have loved to have snagged Gordon or Gurley, but I'll settle for Mr. Cooper."

DynastyFF,3di1n6,FaceSmashers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"A few lessons I have learned along the way:  1) Never make a move based on how it will affect you 1 week. Always be thinking long term  2) Sell defense for offense whenever you can (assuming IDP). Relevant fantasy defensive players pop up way more often than offensive players  3) Do your research for the rookie draft. Hitting big on 3rd and 4th rounders is the key to success in my opinion. Most guys will hit their first rounder, those late rounds are the difference makers.  4) Get to know the other teams in your league almost as well as you know your own. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your fellow managers will allow you to win more trades than you lose.  5) Get the RedZone channel. Seriously. Being able to watch all of the scoring plays has been a boon to my fantasy knowledge."
DynastyFF,3di1n6,ookla76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"My dynasty league is set up through fleaflicker.com.  They are pretty flexible with rules/roster setup... We do a 2qb/2te roster and have only had issues during the draft.  The site has trouble when there are uneven trades or trades during the draft... but I believe they are trying to work out those issues.  Also, I have a keeper league on NFL.com.  I'm not a commissioner in that league so I don't have experience with the nuts and bolts, but the site is pretty slick.  It tracks year to year history, which is nice. And the app is good.  Fleaflicker does not offer an app, just a mobile site.  Starting any league is a bit daunting, but you don't have to get everything perfectly right at the beginning. Owners should know that there could be growing pains like scoring tweeks (we've adjusted Defensive and Kicker scoring a few times over the years, switched waiver priority to an auction system, and added contract years to keepers).  Just because it's a dynasty league, doesn't mean it can't evolve and change."
DynastyFF,3di1n6,Hawxfan,0,Thu Jul 16 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the two schools of thought on Dynasty league success are ""Win Now"" or ""Win Later."" You could grab a team full of this years aging studs and win year one, but in a few years your team will all be on the decline. Grabbing younger players with lots of career ahead of them allows you to be competitive now and into the future. I personally like to blend both because with the larger rosters of a dynasty league, you can have reliable veterans and cultivate rookies/younger players. WRs seem to have more value as their shelf life in the NFL is longer, which is why I have cultivated a great WR corps. I will need to add RB depth in the years to come as Marshawn Lynch and Frank Gore will be my starters this year. My WRs are Megatron, Emmanuel Sanders, Keenan Allen, Amari Cooper, Cordarelle Patterson, and Marvin Jones. Megatron approaching 30 but still has good years left, Eman is mid career-ish at 27, and the rest of my guys are still young but good(we'll see about CP.) I do have some younger RBs and have handcuffed just about everyone, A. Ellington and David Johnson, Gore and Herron, and I also have Charles Sims in hopes that he pans out. I also just paid a high price (VJax, Jace Amaro, 3rd and 4th picks this year) to get Ryan Tannehill as QB was my most glaring need(Cutler and Smith). With his new receivers and only in his 4th season this year, he should be my guy for years to come and that allowed me to not have to reach for Winston or Mariota. I believe that If a grab a first round RB next year or use some of my depth at WR and TE (Eifert, Donnell, Owen Daniels, Clive Walford) to grab one or two I should be good to go for a long time."
DynastyFF,3djq3i,the_real_Alex14,5,Thu Jul 16 20:45:10 2015 UTC,"I really think you're overpaying for this one. The 2017 first and 2017 second alone approaches Agholor's value in a vacuum, and sending off Foster and Roddy for Murray isn't a move I'd be making myself.  I'd look elsewhere or see if you can scale back those picks a little bit, and/or get back something else of value from him."
DynastyFF,3djq3i,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad trade, but I wouldnt do it and here's why:  Your team is a mix of older and younger players.  By doing this trade, you're trying to get a little bit more youth and I understand that, but for you to give future picks is counter-intuitive, especially for Latavius Murray and Agholor.  My reasoning is that it's not a bad trade, but you can definitely get more value/younger guys with those pieces. Roddy is basically worthless in dynasty, so you could try selling him to an UBER win now team during the season. Foster isn't too old, but has a lot of wear and tear. IMO he's undervalued. What really bugs me is that your giving away a 1st and 2nd. Yea it's 2017, but those picks could really come in dandy later on.  If I were to deal those picks, it would probably be with a package like Foster and a 1st for someone like HIll or Lacy. stuff like that. I would get young guys who are PROVEN, not people who could or could not breakout like Murray and Agholor."
DynastyFF,3djq3i,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"I think the trade is pretty even, but I'd lean towards the Murray/Agholor side.  2017 1st + 2nd < Agholor  The picks are too far out and who knows where they might end up.  Foster + White = Murray  I'd rather have the younger talent here in Murray."

DynastyFF,3diczn,Wetzilla,3,Thu Jul 16 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"I think Woods is the drop. I'd keep Bell because he is a ? right now and could be good. Britt would be my second choice, since he kinda sucks and there are a lot of WR's there without clear roles. Janis I want to believe in so bad. Janis > Bell > Britt > Woods for me. Woods is talented but that situation is worthless"
DynastyFF,3diczn,Sticky_Z,2,Thu Jul 16 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same spot with Britt and Woods.  I'm leaning towards Woods.  I think of it like this; you're going to make pick ups off the wire throughout the season, so you'll probably end up dropping both of them anyway. Assuming one doesn't happen to go nuts early on, but come on.. that's not likely.  Janis has some good future upside, and he impressed when he subbed for Jodry in training camp.   Bell will end up being the Bucs slot receiver at some point, if all goes well."
DynastyFF,3diczn,xlShadylx,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"I have Britt and am torn on him. He's flashed WR1 ability. I'm tempted to hang with him over a rookie in a similar situation as him. My hope is that with Foles there, he can be a legit WR2. He's still not THAT old. His RZ ability still has me holding him essentially."
DynastyFF,3diczn,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"I think it has to be between Britt and Woods. Janis and Bell both have some development upside and should eventually contribute on their respective teams.. be it this year or the next (or the next, idk..)  Out of the two, I'm dropping Woods. The kid obviously has some talent but his situation is not good. Britt has talent but has also suffered due to poor QB play. Foles should help him out. If push comes to shove, you'll likely be dropping Britt during the season for a FA guy, anyway."
DynastyFF,3diczn,dumbname2,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:09 2015 UTC,Definitely not Janis...I think I'd go Woods. The Bills just don't pass enough.
DynastyFF,3diczn,auggiedoggies,2,Thu Jul 16 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go ahead and say it. Robert Woods is the most undervalued player in dynasty right now. He's 23 years old, going into his 3rd season and has shown signs that he can contribute in the passing game even with a terrible QB. None of these guys will contribute much this year (if at all), but I'd rather have Woods than any of them because he's the youngest and has shown he can play."
DynastyFF,3diczn,akbfrosty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"Janis is a multi-year hold. If you're not going to be willing to hold onto him through at least 2016, go ahead and drop him now. I wouldn't though; there's a reason why I own him on virtually every team.  Are you sure there's nobody else you can drop? A kicker? A defense? An extra QB?  If you're certain that's the case, I'd be dropping Britt or Woods. Can probably just flip a coin since they're both just lotto tickets at this point."
DynastyFF,3diczn,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"Having a similar dilemma with Britt, Woods, Andrew Hawkins, Patterson.  I feel like I've waited for Kenny Britt for years with the ""this is the year"" yet hes never had more than 40 some receptions, 700 some yards...even if he had a good year I'd try to sell high as fast as I can...  The other 3 might have more upside if they pan out. Hawkins had a lot of targets last year and 63 catches and I'm in a PPR. Woods is in year 3 and will get a lot of single coverage. Hopefully he gets some sort of QB play. Patterson is on his final chance to step up."
DynastyFF,3diczn,adrianp07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:05:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I think Woods is the best drop here. I would try and sell Stills high if his production starts to increase in Miami.

DynastyFF,3dhub5,danrose24,6,Thu Jul 16 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"No. DO not do a reverse order rookie draft. Even worse would be doing it snake. ALL rookie drafts should be standard (or straight) 1.01 has 2.01 and so on. You want to make sure that the guy who earned 1.01 has the best chance to get good players. Having 1.01 and 2.12 is not the way to do that. Now lets look at why doing reverse is not the best way. The guy at 1.12(12th and 13th overall) gets (for example by ADP) Randall Cobb and Eddie Lacy, then gets Amari Cooper in the rookie....That seems a little unbalanced when Amari is going 16th overall by DLF ADP. I dont think more needs to be said.  Now there are three main ways to fix this problem. Ill go into detail because im writing a commish article on this and we need it for the wiki ( /r/DynastyFF/wiki/startup ).  Option 1: Include the rookies in the startup draft. This gives a lot of flexibility to owners to decide how they value rookies and youth. If they want to take a rook over a vet its in their power. It makes it fair for everyone.  Option 2: Include the rookie picks in the startup. So an owner can select 1.01 or 3.04 in the startup draft. This means they can then trade those before the rookie or whatever. While this isnt much different than selecting the actual players it does allow for a rookie draft and an owner can feel good to just buy a 1st rounder and move on.  Option 3: Include the draft slots in the rookie draft. This one is kind of funky, but I sort of dig it. Each owner must pick a draft slot during the startup. I.E. An owner can pick the ""1"" slot and they pick from 1.01, 2.01, 3.01 etc in the rookie. All owners MUST pick a slot by the end of the draft. This is kind of a cool way to add some fun into the draft. Do I take my draft slot now? Or wait and maybe dont move far down.  Always allow trading at all times and any of these are MUCH better than just doing a reverse order. Its extremely unfair."
DynastyFF,3dhub5,Sticky_Z,3,Thu Jul 16 12:13:01 2015 UTC,"Options 1 and 2 are best, and this late in the offseason, it's probably better (and easier) just to do option 1."
DynastyFF,3dhub5,heyfeefellskee,2,Thu Jul 16 13:00:55 2015 UTC,"I just did a start up draft, but we voted to do it all together. So we just did vets and rookies in one big snake draft."
DynastyFF,3dhub5,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 16 12:07:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everyone here.  Include the rookies to your startup draft, or at least the rookie picks.    Simply put, when you separate the drafts completely, it's a huge advantage to anyone who gets a high rookie draft pick.  Cooper and Gurley are worth 2nd round picks in startup drafts, while someone who gets 1.12 in a rookie draft winds up with a player who has an ADP of a 7th round startup pick (Funchess or Strong, let's say).  By separating the drafts completely, it's like you're giving some people an extra 2nd round pick in the startup and others just a 7th round pick."

DynastyFF,3dhub5,heyfeefellskee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:31 2015 UTC,the snake draft does kind of screw people over if they are in a sucky position. having 2 separate snakes does it even more--it actually doesn't really help that you have pick 1.12 in one and 1.01 in another.

If you can do it after training camps, I'd wait to see who impresses there before making cuts and trades.  Are there limits to the number of kickers or D/STs a team can have? If your league limits it to say 2, I'd drop a kicker and team like that.  As for trades, try flicking TRich to a Latavius owner.  I'd also definitely look to shore up another QB."
DynastyFF,3djc1t,LastOfTheOsirans,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help.  That's a good call.  Cuts won't happen until NFL final cuts, so the smart play would be to wait and see how the preseason games shake out.  Hopefully TRich has a good showing and I can move him.  I'd love to upgrade my qb position, but this league is only one year old and QB values are all over the place.  I drafted Mariota and flipped him/Ellington/Wallace/Huff for Lacy/Watkins/Maxx/McCown/2016 2nd.  I wanted to keep him, but that deal seemed too good to pass up."
DynastyFF,3di8zt,LittleHelpForAFriend,2,Thu Jul 16 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"Love the team name! Interesting squad, I think its very win now oriented. Qb is awesome. RB is a lot older than you want on a dynasty team, but should kill it for 2015.. WR is a mixed bag, no real WR1 stud to be found. A lot of WR2 numbers in Brown/Edleman/Landry/Vjax. Should do you just fine even starting 3 of them. TE is a bit sketchy for me compared to the rest of the team. LB is pretty awesome, not sure if I would have spent that much capital on LB, when its likely easier to grab two studs (Huston/bowman or Mac/Barr as LB2) and gone from there. Love the Devy guy. Thats a steal, he is going to be a 1st rounder almost for sure."

Hopefully you can trade one of your QBs and a pick for a solid young WR. I don't do IDP or Devy, so I can't really comment with any knowledge on those."
DynastyFF,3di8zt,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty decent team, so don't take these critiques as criticisms!   Too many QBs. You have Andrew Luck, so there's no reason to carry a third QB, let alone a fourth. Osweiler and Garoppolo need to go. Very strong RBs for 2015, weak RBs for 2017. You'll want to address this going forward but can probably table that decision for next year's draft. Very good WRs, but no first tier guys. Edelman and Landry should be able to carry you in 2015. I'm not a devy guy so can't really speak to Wilson's upside, but I do know he was arrested on drug charges this year. Is there somebody else you can take a flier on instead? Stud IDPs. Should be expected only starting 2 IDP flex, but you did well here anyway. I'd shop Houston unless your league is a heavy big play format, since he's getting a lot of press right now and can probably sell for more than he's worth."
DynastyFF,3di8zt,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I took Osweiler and Garoppole as long term prospects. By the 5th and 6th round of our rookie/FA draft the pickings were pretty thin. Plan is to play Luck with Flacco as bye week fill in. The more I look at the team the more I figure this year and next will be my window to win considering my RB's. Hopefully one of my WR's will pop and help carry me while I look for RB's after that. WR's went fast in the start up draft and I didn't want to reach, so I didn't grab a WR until 4.11 and 5.02.    Overall I tried to go with lots of depth at each position with hopes of drafting or trading for a RB with future potential in the coming seasons.  Last year I won my redraft league thanks to your posts in r/fantasyfootball. So I always appreciate your input."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,eaglesf4n86,2,Thu Jul 16 06:52:26 2015 UTC,Goggle nfl expansion draft. It's a similar concept. Each team gets to protect x number of players. Then if one of their players are selected they get to protect x more. It's all about finding the right balance. 4 is usually a good number but less means the new teams have a chance. Personally I hate expansions.....id rather daft a new league or redraft the whole thing
DynastyFF,3dh99a,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:32:29 2015 UTC,I agree... I think I'd just prefer to start over at that point. I don't think there is a fair way to expand. I would rather do a straight draft where first place team goes first and newcomers last. I think this is the fairest way to give everyone roster diversity without penalizing current members.
DynastyFF,3dh99a,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 16 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"I'd be livid if one of my leagues did that, though. Imagine if you spent a year or two (or more!) rebuilding, and when you're finally ready to compete, your team was dissolved."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"In our league, it'd require a vote obviously. But I don't know how you create a balanced league for newcomers when the top 50 is locked up. That's a best case core of Desean Jackson, Brandon Marshall, Davante Adams at WR and Alfred Morris/Crowell at RB. Those guys aren't terrible, but in a 10 tm league you'll likely face someone with OBJ+Watkins+Cooks+Foster+Stewart or Antonio+Calvin+GTate+Murray+Gordon. The owner might not commit to the league if he feels he can't compete, and that takes away the fun for everyone."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 16 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"IMO any person looking to join a league as an expansion franchise has to be willing to take on a rebuild. It's not fair to the established owners otherwise.   Of course if everybody votes for it then that's how it should be, but speaking for myself I would never vote for an expansion that puts the new franchises on equal footing with everybody else."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 16 16:27:24 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm just starting my first dynasty league too. So I don't have the deep attachment to my team yet... that could be influencing my perspective a bit!
DynastyFF,3dh99a,aussiemac24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"What about keeping something like 5-6 players from each team... and everyone drafts from the pool left over, with the new teams getting the first X picks in the order."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,heyfeefellskee,2,Thu Jul 16 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like 50 locked players is too many. Just going off of ADP, first unlocked players would be Jarvis Landry. I guess thats not a horrible start, but its far from ideal. 40th is Agholor/Tate, I guess not much better....Expending is so hard haha. I think each team locks 3 players, then if a player gets stolen they can lock 3 more and so on. I do like the pool idea, but it hurts teams that have prospects they really like"
DynastyFF,3dh99a,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"i was going to say, have them lock 2 WR's max, 1 RB, 1 QB, and 1 TE... idk if that helps at all."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,heyfeefellskee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:08:37 2015 UTC,"As Sticky said, you let them draft X players off of current teams, typically allowing every owner to protect his core players.  Aside from that, you can inject extra picks into the draft for them.  Be careful though, as adding too many will bum out a lot of owners who feel their draft picks are losing value.  The last thing to do, which I really urge you to  consider, is a season long probation.  The expansion teams would begin effectively right now.  The owners would have the ability to start adding FAs (likely onto a limited sized roster) and trading like any other. However, they don't play any games this season.  This allows them to build through free agency, hopefully finding a few gems, without the urge to compete and win games.  It also allows them to become accustomed to the league settings and values of players - which is especially important if an expansion owner is a first time dynasty player."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,peckx063,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"Let everybody protect X players. Then the two new teams each select an unprotected player for their team. If a given team has a player picked off of their roster, they can then protect another Y players. That prevents any one team from losing too many assets, but allows the expansion teams to have some amount of worthy talent."
DynastyFF,3dh99a,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Another idea is to give concessions to the expansion teams.  Allow them to select 5 free agents prior to the start of the draft.  That way they can build up some talent with rookies or Free Agents.  Then have your yearly draft.    Another idea, is to lower the buy-in for the first two years.  If your league buy-in is $100, maybe the expansion teams only have to pay $50 for the next two years."
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,IReallyShouldntBeOn,3,Thu Jul 16 03:05:57 2015 UTC,"Gronk is much better than graham. Gordon, adams and late first is a good margin better than hyde.  All in all, Gronk is too good of an asset to give up with the uncertainty of Graham in SEA."
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,Swisscheese1021,3,Thu Jul 16 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"I would accept. I don't agree that Gronk is miles ahead of Graham. Gronk has missed 20 games in the past 3 seasons.  He's had 8 surgeries - including back and knee problems. Sure; he's two years younger, but I don't see how you can reasonably ecpect him to play more games than Graham going forward. There's a very, very real chance his body can't hold up for an extended period of time. Yes, Gronk>Graham, but the disparity is over stated.   Im high on Gordon (he's suffering from just-another-Wisconsin-back syndrome when he's actually literally the best back I've scouted since AP), so I'm taking this - although I agree with other posters that you might be able to get slightly more value here.  I alao despise the notion that Graham going to Seattle is a worse situation than New Orleans.  Think of the touchdowns man, think of the touchdowns."
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,peckx063,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:43 2015 UTC,Just my 2 cents:  1) Gronk is 1 injury away from never being a 1st round pick ever again. No one talks about this...  2) Graham going to Seattle is a worst situation because even though his TD count will be similar his targets will drop quite a bit thus his floor remains the same and his cieling is lowered.
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,boredatworkbored,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure his ceiling is any lower. In NO, he received 19% of the targets. Compared to most elite WR/TEs, that's a pretty low number.  Brees spreads the ball out quite a bit, and it hurts everyone in the offense.    Seattle's passing volume is going to increase. They have an ascending superstar QB and an aging lead back. The defense will fall off from elite levels at some point, and shootouts will be more necessary for them.  Wilson rushed a ton on scrambles last year as well. How many of those scrambles are going to instead be ""toss it to that huge guy"" instead?  Furthermore, the Seahawks lake elite WRs and passing backs, which means that passing game is going to run through Graham. Last year Wilson threw it 452 times.  If he throws it 500 times and 25% of those go to Graham, his targets haven't depreciated. I'll take a prop bet that Graham actually averages more targets per game than he did in 2014, and his end zone targets will increase dramatically."
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,peckx063,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"This.  Everybody who thinks what happened to Graham last year can't happen to Gronk is delusional.  It's not just possible, it's perhaps even likely.  Why everybody thinks that Seattle acquired Graham to be a pass blocker on a team with no elite receivers blows my mind.  To think that Graham actually had a good year compared to almost every other TE in the league, and all the injuries he had and times he was only as a decoy because of said injuries is astounding and a testament to his skill.  The only reason people are down on him is because he didn't put up first round draft-worthy numbers.  I understand the value of a good TE, but I don't know anybody who ever won their league drafting a TE first (who was actually had that same TE and actively using him throughout the playoffs).  Yes, disparity can elevate a player to being worth a first rounder, but the domino effect that can have on your entire team rounds later just gets worse and worse.  To put all of that on Graham was just asking too much.  Worse yet, he might have actually come close to being worth it without the injury, but his real value was in the second round, imo and too much of a risk in the first round to begin with.  To ask so much of a TE, to put so much weight on those shoulders, and then to denounce him because he doesn't pull through with unreasonable expectations is just silly.  Anybody who can get Graham while he's value so much less than Gronk is going to get a steal comparatively."
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,Unpossible42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have done this trade at all. TE's last long, and Gronk is only 26 so you could have him for a long time while your team develops... Dishing out Hyde only hurts you more because I value him higher/ just as high as Gordon. I don't think Adams and the 1st put this trade in your favor... not a good one"
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Thu Jul 16 03:45:08 2015 UTC,Hyde over Gordon feels off. I think Gordon is much more talented and on a team that will be better on offense for the forseeable future.   I would personally not do it though. Simply because Gronk is that good.
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,fantasy_boss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"I would say yes, especially if those other two teams are THAT good."
DynastyFF,3dgnoz,Santidreet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:01:44 2015 UTC,"I think you can do better than this. Getting back Graham isn't where you want to be if you're not looking to compete this year, since he's already 28 and has a fair amount of uncertainty baked into his price tag.  Also, with the first rounder being so likely to be a low first, you don't have the usual upside of a future pick. For Gronkowski alone you should be able to get one or two first rounders with top tier upside beyond what you're getting here, but not if you're getting back Graham.  I'd keep shopping."
DynastyFF,3demm1,sicknarlo,5,Wed Jul 15 17:52:16 2015 UTC,You know that MFL has a baller API...

DynastyFF,3dgrdx,slodanslodan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:33:39 2015 UTC,"No, you can pick up the rookies off the waiver wire as normal, or the LM can use their godmode powers to put players on teams."

DynastyFF,3dgpjl,thefadd,7,Thu Jul 16 03:22:08 2015 UTC,100% I'd go with Doug Martin. Apparantly he's looking good and none of the other backs in TB are even close to matching his talent. I'd go with him
DynastyFF,3dgpjl,onlymycouchpullsout,3,Thu Jul 16 03:43:24 2015 UTC,This. Simms sucks. Martin has some talent and can be traded if/when he starts if you don't like him personally.
DynastyFF,3dgpjl,SilverViper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:27 2015 UTC,"Injuries and terrible offense has killed Martin, but for his value right now, he's a deal."
DynastyFF,3dgpjl,swoodmanroxu,3,Thu Jul 16 12:03:30 2015 UTC,Doug Martin. You have seen that he can produce. He might be able to do that again.  He is already a lottery ticket himself.
DynastyFF,3dgpjl,whater39,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"I would take Martin. He could win the job back in Tampa where the offense is looking up. Lee, however, is already behind Robinson and maybe Hurns in an offense that hasn't proven anything. (not including Blackmon in the equation)"

DynastyFF,3dgpjl,MisterHeatMiser,2,Thu Jul 16 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"Don't do that. It's way better to be stacked at WR than every other position, there are always starting caliber RBs on the waiver wire at some point during the year."

DynastyFF,3de6fv,auggiedoggies,4,Wed Jul 15 15:57:36 2015 UTC,I REALLY wouldnt worry. With a budget that small and a roster that big. I bet you can get a ton of steals for 1$. if you are really worried see if you can trade for $$$ or wait till the auction is over and trade your face off. Thats a solid core.
DynastyFF,3de6fv,Sticky_Z,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:35 2015 UTC,"So you really don't think it's a major worry to only have $10 left?   I agree, I feel like there will be plenty of steals out there, plus an offseason BB Waiver run after this. It just feels weird to have almost no money already haha"
DynastyFF,3de6fv,Sticky_Z,4,Wed Jul 15 16:08:44 2015 UTC,Now you can crack a beer and watch. Its really not an issue. I would lay low till everyone else is out of cash then drop 10 1$'s. Get some love going for your guys and think about some trades.
DynastyFF,3de6fv,slodanslodan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with Sticky. You are a little under where you'd like to be, but really you should only have $20 left after that many of your core studs. What's going to hurt is lack of depth for bye weeks and minor injuries. Your record isn't going to keep up with points-scored.  The nice thing is that the waiver wire is going to be easy for you. You can rotate players and play matchups more easily than a balanced team because you'll have tons of players to cut without a second thought."

DynastyFF,3de6fv,slodanslodan,3,Wed Jul 15 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"I'd be throwing out higher priced guys you don't like, get everyone else to blow their money before you start nominating the people you actually like. It's really hard to completely sneak someone by."
DynastyFF,3de6fv,aussiemac24,3,Wed Jul 15 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"I would nominate high price guys, whoever the next guy who would be autodrafted idea. hold off on the young guys you want. let others spend their money, then you can nominate the guys you want and get them for $1 most of the time"
DynastyFF,3de6fv,aussiemac24,2,Wed Jul 15 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Don't try to sneak $1 guys. I've been in tons of auctions and it doesn't work. Someone will always throw $2 at somebody. Just keep them in your back pocket until half of the teams are down to your level. It is best to nominate unsexy old vets that maybe no one wants (including you, but it'll be better than a WW guy)."
DynastyFF,3de6fv,slodanslodan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"How many more slots left to fill? This isn't uncommon TBH, and this is usually the better approach. If you're looking to trade someone, I would look at your QBs. To pay $25 for a primary bench player is a bit steep for my liking. Like you said, your core is awesome though! If you're looking for cheap players, here are some I'd recommend:   Tavon Austin - No way he doesn't go for $1. Dude still has electric potential, finally getting a decent QB, and hitting year 3 which is usually a blossoming year Cord Patterson - Read same as above, but he has more competition this year. Again, you're approach is studs or duds right?  TB back-up RB: If history repeats itself, one if not both backups will have some PT. Go for Sims if you can get him for $1 D. Freeman: Doubt he goes for $1, but he is currently the starter and will be huge PPR asset if he gets the PT FJax/Sproles/Woodhead: These guys still find ways to add value for cheap Rudolph could be a sneaky TE value for you as well I'd also grab Dalton to make parting with Eli/Ben easier"
DynastyFF,3dfgco,NotInYourLeague,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:30 2015 UTC,Don't worry too much about him losing Peyton.  He was still a stud with Tim Tebow throwing the ball.  He will be fine.  Denver will have a solid QB in place by then.
DynastyFF,3dfgco,gibbsftw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:56:56 2015 UTC,Dez it means literally nothing for his value. Same as yesterday. DT is now a bronco for longer. Depending on how you feel about his life after Peyton that's another fact to think about.
DynastyFF,3dfgco,Sticky_Z,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"This means neither will miss games this year, which is fantastic. Long term, I'd rather they both stay where they are, even DT after Peyton retires, than move to the kinds of bad offenses that would take on a huge money FA WR (Oakland, Jax, etc). Obviously if DT or Dez played this year franchise tagged and moved to Green Bay or Indy, that'd be great haha, but the chances that either had of moving somewhere with an improved situation would have been quite low."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,aussiemac24,5,Wed Jul 15 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting analysis, but I think you should be careful about drawing too many conclusions from it.  The problem with including the 2014 class in this analysis is that plenty of them (like Hyde, Adams, and Ebron) are being considered ""hits"" despite not actually scoring many points so far. They're skating by just on potential. 2013 rookies like Ball and Patterson were in similar situations last season. They hadn't produced much, but they would have been considered hits had you done this analysis after their rookies season, like you're doing for the 2014 rookies.  I think you should be comparing rookies from different draft classes at the same point in their careers (ideally 2-3 years after their rookie seasons). Doing the analysis the way you have isn't going to yield many actionable insights."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,m_plis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:38 2015 UTC,"Ah great observation. That helps explain the 2nd year decline. You could tell the data is biased in that way that rookies get more 'slack' than 2nd year players, and I agree with all your points."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,m_plis,2,Wed Jul 15 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"If you want to explore this area further, you could use rookie ADP data from MFL that seems to be decent.

DynastyFF,3de5pq,chkessle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:21:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. I was just trying to throw something together very quickly to demonstrate more the value of picks within the same class vs across classes. An analysis like you mention would be very meaningful though.
DynastyFF,3de5pq,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:29 2015 UTC,Yes. Carlos Hyde is 2014's Montee Ball.
DynastyFF,3de5pq,quickonthedrawl,3,Thu Jul 16 11:02:35 2015 UTC,"Some amount of this should be expected, no? Obviously the 2014 class is extreme regardless, but I bet you'd find for every year X's startup drafts, Year X-1's rookies will show up disproportionately compared to X-2, X-3, etc."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"I agree a bit, but I wouldn't think 2nd year youth would be discarded so much for rookie youth. If you look at the players themselves, they just don't stack up. For example, Tavon Austin, Richard Franklin, Montee Ball <<< Anyone in 2014 Draft Class top 10. Patterson is the only person who seemed to have actually realized potential and then drop back down. But that was still in a very short sample size at the end of the year. Jury is still out for him, but it doesn't look good."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,slodanslodan,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, don't get me wrong, the 2014 draft class looks better at the top and deeper than 2013 in almost every way. But I wish we had reliable startup + rookie ADP from one, two, three years ago so we could compare."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,Jesselock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree. I think it also goes to show, if you draft Amari Cooper and someone offers Watkins straight up, it might actually be a good deal favoring Watkins."
DynastyFF,3de5pq,chkessle,2,Wed Jul 15 16:25:57 2015 UTC,Pretty nice little chart. Adding past and present startup ADPs would be nice too.
DynastyFF,3dep29,cmp343,8,Wed Jul 15 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"Even as someone that is consistently on the side of taking youth and preparing for the future, I would not do this deal.   I would definitely be shopping Megatron if I wanted to revamp my team, but I wouldnt be doing it when the best thing coming back is the 1.08.   Also, Tre Mason is not someone that I would be selling at the moment, as his value has hit a new low with the addition of Gurley. Mason is a long term hold if you ask me, and I expect his talent to win out somewhere at some point."

DynastyFF,3dep29,Dr_Lollygag,3,Wed Jul 15 18:27:31 2015 UTC,I would do that deal.
DynastyFF,3dep29,bastegod,2,Wed Jul 15 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"Second that. Far prettier. Personally I have big expectations for Bryant as being in perhaps the best WR2 situation in the game, and Spiller will be utilized in Sprolesian fashion. The first rounder tips the trade over in your favor, and the extra picks are just gravy. Do it."
DynastyFF,3dep29,blardorg,2,Wed Jul 15 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"How many teams are in your league? The value of those picks changes a decent amount if it's an 8, 10, 12, or 14 team league! 2.03 could be the 11th, 13th, 15th, or 17th pick in the draft, ya know?"
DynastyFF,3dep29,aussiemac24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:23 2015 UTC,Also agreed. This almost seems unrealistic given your starting point. Essentially puts Calvin at Martavis Bryant+Spiller+1.08+2.03+3.03. That would be very close to (3) 1sts.
DynastyFF,3dep29,jdr393,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:57 2015 UTC,"I would second this - and Dr Lollygag's initial comments. Reggie Bush does nothing for your future, and Mason's value is incredibly low - but he is a young asset that should rise in the future with a change of scenery."

DynastyFF,3dep29,TitletownGB,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"Id think you could get way more value for Calvin than that (Think probably 2 first round picks or equivalent young players.). Not to mention Tre Mason is not just a throw in player. Ya he has gurley in front of him, but he is still a young talented RB, that holds sig value to a Gurley owner and also could get his own shot in a new team in a few years.  Also, Bush should hold NO value to you if your looking to revamp your team for the future."

DynastyFF,3dep29,chiefst,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:08:12 2015 UTC,Reggie Bush is worthless IMO. So Tre Mason and Megatron for some crappy picks? This is an awful trade for you. I wouldn't even dignify the offer with a counter. I'd just say no.
DynastyFF,3dep29,fantasy_boss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"Reggie Bush is the opposite of revamping for the future. I'd lean Tre then.   I also feel like you can get more for Calvin. Only the 8th overall pick at best. Count me out on this and go ask for a couple young high % prospects from teams competing now that Calvin will help.   Remember you're selling Calvin low because of his injuries last year too. Dude is only 29. Even when he slows down, he's not going to shrink. You've have a 3-year window for him still being elitre and at least a 4-5 year window where he is a WR2 at worst probably."
DynastyFF,3dep29,Unpossible42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:21:43 2015 UTC,"You have to break that down.  Calvin Johnson, just by himself, should probably be more than Reggie Bush and all the picks combined, I think.  That first round pick ain't all that great, and the 2nd and 3rd are just throwing darts in the dark.  Then, on top of that, you're adding in Tre mason and a 4th flyer.  You could deal Tre Mason for Reggie Bush and a pick, or something like that, but Calvin Johnson sticks out like a sore thumb here."

DynastyFF,3de2yt,Sticky_Z,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"He's a totally fine QB2. I suspect he finishes in the high teens. Keep in mind that top 5 QB finish two years ago included Marvin Jones getting 10 TDs on only 51 catches, which is hugely unsustainable (same year Green had 11 TDs on 98 catches, for reference), and Gio Bernard was more efficient that year as well (though not crazily moreso). But I'd say finishing somewhere between QB20 and QB12 is very likely for Dalton."

DynastyFF,3de2yt,Sw33tch1nmusic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'd gladly have him as a QB2 at his current value.  EDIT: How he and Tannehill are so far apart in ADP but so similar in production blows my mind"
DynastyFF,3de2yt,aussiemac24,4,Wed Jul 15 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"Easy, because Tannehill has increased in fantasy value and metrics every season, while Dalton has remained a high-volume, low-efficiency QB his entire short career.  Dalton  2011 QB18  2012 QB12  2013 QB5  2014 QB19  Tannehill  2012 QB24  2013 QB16  2014 QB9  Dalton's completion percentage went from 58-62-62-64. Tannehill's has gone from 58-60-66. Dalton's AY/A has gone from 6.2-6.6-6.9-6.3. Tannehill's has gone from 6.1-6.2-6.9. Etc. So while Tannehill has improved year-to-year in each of his three seasons, Dalton has stagnated and regressed in many/most of them.  If Tannehill slips back into the QB2 ranks in 2015 instead of ascending into the mid QB1 range, we'll see him treated with the same disdain as Dalton."
DynastyFF,3de2yt,quickonthedrawl,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"The Tanny-love and Dalton-hate is warranted but I think its mainly due to the arrival of Bill Lazor & Hue Jackson and their playcalling.  What if these OCs switched places prior to the start of 2014? Maybe Dalton would be the dynasty darling instead of Tannehill  For fantasy, efficiency is king. Tannehill is excellent at those short to medium passes. In reality though I think I'd rather have a gunslinger if I was a GM.  They are where they are but the one thing that sticks out to me about Tannehill is that last year he couldn't throw a damn TD pass against the Jets (1 TD in 74 attempts) and the Jets were letting everyone score on them."
DynastyFF,3de2yt,brucemilus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"I'd argue Dalton is better. I should say I'd argue they are equal value. If I had Tannehill, I'd gladly trade for Dalton + 2nd Rd in a 2QB league    Experience Dalton Tannehill Difference    1 QB18 QB24 +6 Dalton   2 QB12 QB16 +4 Dalton   3 QB5 QB9 +4 Dalton   4 QB19 TBD TBD    As the original poster pointed out, Dalton lost his entire WR corps for a good stretch last year. To me Tannehill = Dalton. Dalton improved every year his first 3 years as well, but regressed this past year. I wouldn't be shocked to see Tannehill do the same.   EDIT: Formatting and edit at beginning"
DynastyFF,3de2yt,aussiemac24,3,Wed Jul 15 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"The problem is you have an extra year of data on Dalton that suggests he's likely not a QB1, whereas everything suggests Tannehill still could be a QB1. Important distinction. If Tannehill finishes 2015 as the QB16 again, his value will plummet similarly.  Separating fantasy numbers, Tannehill also seems either marginally or significantly better in most passing metrics. Talent > situation, and all that jazz."

Yep  That said, no one in their right mind would give any of those pieces for either Boldin or White. Or any of those mid 30s receivers. You're looking at more like a mid-late third round pick if you're lucky and find a desperate buyer (or a mid-late fourth for Boldin)."
DynastyFF,3dfp4y,quickonthedrawl,3,Wed Jul 15 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"Just bought White for a 2016 4th in a 14 team IDP league. The pick is projected at the 48-50 range. I felt that was a decent price for a guy who might be a low-end #2 for two more years.  If you could get anything in the late-2nd or early-3rd for White you should be ecstatic. For Boldin anything in the 3rd is solid value.  Coleman (1.08-1.10), Crowell (1.08-1.10), and even a 2nd rounder is a dream."

DynastyFF,3dfp4y,andyLDN,0,Thu Jul 16 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"White is a good player to buy right now.  I genuinely think he has about 2.01 value.  So if you can buy him for less than that, I think you're getting a heck of a player on the cheap.  That said, I haven't come across anyone willing to pay a 2nd for him, which puts the screws to his owners if they want to dump him."

DynastyFF,3dfp4y,andyLDN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:06:24 2015 UTC,"I actually own him in my main league for this reason.  I value him at 2.01, but wouldn't expect to pay that much for him simply because of his perceived value. That said, I made some off season moves to target and get players exactly like him for less than their perceived value.  Rookie draft time is a great time to get aging vets on the cheap."
DynastyFF,3dfp4y,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"Just curious then, which of these rookies would you not trade Roddy for?   Duke Johnson Jay Ajayi Devin Funchess Jaelen Strong David Johnson Jameis Winston David Cobb Marcus Mariota Matt Jones   All of those guys have an ADP from ~2.01 onward."
DynastyFF,3dfp4y,andyLDN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"To make a long answer short, I'd probably only move him for Duke Johnson if I think I'm competing.  I'm not that huge of a Duke Johnson fan, but I'd say Duke and Jay present more value than Roddy long term.  I also like Strong enough to boost him as close to equal or maybe with a 5th round throw-in.  However I wouldn't move him for Jay, because our draft proved his stock has taken a huge hit, as he fell to 3.02 and I could probably get him for less.  I'd consider Mariota and Winston, but QBs are a special breed.  Despite their lower ADP getting your hands on these guys can be a challenge, but you also have to be patient with them.  That being said, if I'm running a complete rebuild and my hand is forced, I probably would only skip on the offers including Funchess, Cobb and Jones as I feel like those guys are going to bust compared to their ranking.  I think we could come to a deal without much hassle on anyone else."
DynastyFF,3dfp4y,boredatworkbored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:21:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, people are desperate for youth this time of year and then desperate for production come game time.  That said I'd never buy a vet over 30 for 2.01 unless they were helping me win a championship that year."
DynastyFF,3dfmr2,csmartin85,2,Wed Jul 15 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely hurts your chances to be a sort of win now team, losing Wilson/Forte/Nelson who will be consistent top notch performers. Adding AD is nice, but Gurley will likely be out the first couple games at least, and Im not sure Keenan and Landry replace Jordys production.   With all if that said, I would take this deal, I just wouldnt expect your chances at a title to remain the same right now. In my opinion you are getting the best player in the deal by far in Gurley, and getting 2 young WRs isn't bad."
DynastyFF,3dfmr2,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:24 2015 UTC,"In terms of (approximate) values:  Wilson = Landry  Forte = Peterson  Nelson = Gurley  Maclin < Allen  Langford < Kaepernick  You win with regard to value. I'd probably make the swap myself, though I'm not super thrilled with what it does to your chances this season. I'm not sure that the downgrade is significant enough to turn it down though."
DynastyFF,3dfmr2,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:28:46 2015 UTC,I am not huge on the outlook of Maclin and Wilson and Nelson and Forte are getting older. Gurley and K. Allen are both young studs with other good players in the mix. I would accept this.

Maclin and Landry are close in value for me. Kaepernick doesn't add much, but I guess I'd rather have him than Langford.  Overall I look at this as a loss for you. I'd stay put."
DynastyFF,3dfkkr,Millsstg,3,Wed Jul 15 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"No, I would not do this. At the moment that would be selling him low, and I think his value is still going to go up quite a bit once he gets on the field this year."

I held pat until the night of the draft to make serious moves to get 1.01 for Gurley. I'd advise doing the same. Cooks will likely hold (or exceed) his value this year so it's probably better to wait it out. You'll also reap the benefits from his play until then."

DynastyFF,3dekt4,Therealcodyg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:40:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed on your cuts.   You should hold Brees/Bradford/Eli unless there is someone else available with more value and you don't have anyone else to cut with less value. I'd certainly cut the Jets DST before any of your QBs. The problem with those three in particular is their 2015 production is tough to gauge. Is Brees really falling off a cliff just yet? Will Eli improve on 2014 or go back to being super inconsistent? Can Bradford stay healthy? I'd probably hold all three until at least a week or two into the season, then cut the one that seems to have the least upside and add a waiver wire flier. But there's nothing wrong with holding all three if their situations are all still murky early in the season.  As for rookies to target, imo you need a bit more help at WR than RB, even moreso because it's PPR. You can start 2 or 3 at either position. For RB, you have AP, Demarco Murray, Hill, and Ingram that will all be minimum top 20 RBs, and Crowell who will likely be a top 30 unless Duke Johnson really comes out fast and strong. For WR, you have OBJ and Benjamin that are sure starters, then Golden Tate and John Brown that have top 20 upside but floors of top 30/40 if Calvin/Fitzgerald/Floyd come back as their dominant selves. LaFell is another option with lower upside, but a floor of maybe top 40, so he's definitely startable in a pinch. I would't want to have to start Crabtree, Harvin, Andre Williams, or Latimer this year.  I would still go BPA in the draft, but if there are guys with similar value, lean WR. Grabbing someone like Perriman at pick 10 would be great for your squad. Hopefully Duke Johnson will be there at pick 20, which will let you be pretty confident of having Cleveland's starting RB. But if someone like Funchess or Jaelen Strong drops that far, I'd have a very hard time passing them up."
DynastyFF,3dejmt,the_real_Alex14,8,Wed Jul 15 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"I actually think Hill's value gets inflated in standard because Gio is the pass-catching back. However, I don't think he's worth 3 firsts at all and here's why:  1) There's only a handful of players worth 3 firsts, and they're all WR's ( you can make an argument for Bell, but I don't think he's worth that personally)  2) RB's have shelf lives that frankly aren't that long. It's an anomaly to have an RB last long at the top: David Wilson, Trent Richardson, etc. etc. etc.  Overall I think his value is higher in standard, and I would probably say he's worth 2 firsts, with maybe an extra 3rd or 2nd thrown in there depending on who you're dealing with. The sample size is frightening, but he was the top RB for fantasy over the course of those 9 games and he IS the starter. Only 1 starting RB on that team and its him, and he's shown he can handle the load."
DynastyFF,3dejmt,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Wed Jul 15 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"Basically nailed it right here.   Agreed in saying Hill is worth more in standard and that he is not worth 3 firsts. The ""stud"" tag is typically given to players that are proven to be among the best at their position and have very little to no risk, and I don't think Hill is even very close to that category."
DynastyFF,3dejmt,Dr_Lollygag,2,Wed Jul 15 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed on basically all accounts. I'd just add that his pedigree as a 2nd round pick, his fantastic size, college production, etc, all give some evidence that supports his great 9 games as a starter not being a fluke. Nothing at all guarantees that he will keep putting up those kind of numbers, but it isn't like he's got red flags suggesting he won't be able to sustain that production."

If your WR and RB youth can become NFL starters you may be a contender.   Your RB situation is just average. Murray is a fine starter, but after he goes on IR you've got a bunch of RB3/4s.  Helu, White, and Langford are all a bit of a question mark. So maybe those guys can be the future for you.  Your WR situation is better. Demaryius and Jeffrey are fine starters. Michael Floyd is fine at WR3, with some potential for more if he can get the QB to throw the ball to him. The rest of your guys are fine stashes.   I like your TE group a lot.   QBS are okay. Ryan won't win your league for you, but shouldn't be a liability either.   D/ST is mehh.  Maybe they can get some spark in their return game from Montgomery coming in and elevate themselves for you.   Guys I may try to get would include my man crush Steve Johnson, Andre Johnson, Eddie Royal, and rookie RBS like Artis-Payne, Rawls, Josh Robinson and Matt Jones. Guys I may try to trade away include Blue, Turbin, and Waller."
DynastyFF,3dds32,Sticky_Z,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"QBS are okay. Ryan won't win your league for you, but shouldn't be a liability either   Who would you rather have besides Luck and Rodgers (im saying their price to acquire is too high)"
DynastyFF,3dds32,chkessle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"In dynasty mode I would rather have any of Luck, Rodgers, Wilson, or Roethlisberger. For this year I believe those four, along with Rivers, Flacco, Eli and Peyton, and Tannehill will outscore Ryan, and Brady while he's not suspended. I'm predicting a down year for the Falcons again in 2015. Ryan is in my third tier. I'd be glad to have him on my fantasy squad, but not at the price he's going for now."
DynastyFF,3dddos,PerfectStorm781,2,Wed Jul 15 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"IMO, I'd go QB round 1 if QBs get 6-pt TDs. You nail Luck/Rodgers and your dynasty team will be relevant for the next 10 years. WRs/RBs are much quicker to develop, so relying on rookie draft there for 1-2 years isn't a bad thing. In 12 man start-up, you could grab Rodgers/Luck first, and still end up with Nuk and Cooks for wr's. For RBs, I'd go for vets like Blount and Forsett who are hugely undervlued and target their younger handcuffs late in your draft."
DynastyFF,3dddos,aussiemac24,2,Wed Jul 15 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I would look at the sidebar and open up the mock draft excel sheet and look at the startup draft tab. That'll give you a good idea of where guys should roughly go.   The first few rounds will be mostly RBs and WRs like you said. There will be a few QBs and TEs mixed in. Since your league is 6pt TDs, QBs are a little bit more valuable than they usually are. In Dynasty, WRs are valued higher than RBs because receivers tend to last longer. So a guy like Odell Beckham is very valuable because (barring injury or something) he has a lot of productive years ahead of him."
DynastyFF,3dddos,Santidreet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"WRs tend to go earlier in dynasty drafts because they have a longer shelf life than RBs. And with 6 point TDs you're going to want to target a QB way earlier than listed above. Personally, an ideal first two rounds in this scenario, for me at least, would be to target Antonio Brown and Andrew Luck. Don't be surprised to see Luck go first round too."

DynastyFF,3ddoap,dwheat1,3,Wed Jul 15 13:33:19 2015 UTC,"Easy way to tell if your team is built to win now: Look at where your players are going in redraft leagues. If it looks like a solid redraft team, then it should have a good shot at a championship.  Cam Newton, 8.08  Jamaal Charles, 1.02  C.J. Anderson, 2.03  Melvin Gordon, 4.02  Antonio Brown, 1.06  T.Y. Hilton, 4.04  Kelvin Benjamin, 5.03  Jordan Matthews, 6.01  Travis Kelce, 6.08  Those numbers are for 8-team leagues. Considering also you have Murray (5.07) and Ellington (7.01), I think it's pretty safe to say your team is good enough to compete. But that does not mean that you should sell off your future assets! Keep as many as you can. In fact, I'd keep all of them for now, until you can see exactly what you need as the season progresses to keep your team competing. If in week 7 you're 2-5, you'd regret trading off strong future assets for an extra WR (or whatever)."

DynastyFF,3db3ey,umaro900,3,Tue Jul 14 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Please don't do as you say with your final installment and cut the talk of the models and algorithms.  Some of us are interested in that.  I want to hear more practical suggestions about what models you think are viable and the variables that will be most predictive short and long term for player performance predictions.  You've supplied plenty of theory, now let's have a discussion about its implementation, yeah?   Excellent post, btw."
DynastyFF,3db3ey,Jtmoor,2,Wed Jul 15 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm definitely going to talk about those...just not right now in this series. I feel that the discussion of those specific models and algorithms deserve more comprehensive treatment than I would have been able to fit in the rest of the post."
DynastyFF,3db3ey,blardorg,3,Wed Jul 15 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"Two general thoughts.   First, you don't need to go to something crazy like neural networks to deal with non-linear relationships. You don't need to move away from linear models to deal with non-linear relationships between variables, you can just transform a variable in such a way that the relationship becomes linear! A generalized linear model with the appropriate link function can probably do some of the things you need. Logistic regression would likely be very useful, and you could model things in a per game basis, like ""probability that player is injured"" and ""probability that they are at least a top N player at his position."" Not sure how you're conceptualizing things in your head, but this sort of framework seems to me to fit nicely with what you've talked about. I'm happy to expand on this and maybe even include some example equations to give the flavor of what I mean if it isn't clear, if you're interested, hah!  A second thought is that probably shouldn't think about these models as giving you a single prediction for a player. Any useful model should give you a distribution of possible outcomes (easiest to think of as positional rankings), because the likelihood of being exactly right with any point prediction (e.g., Keenan Allen will finish as WR#23) is very low due to the stochasticity of FF. So, for example, maybe your model predicts Cobb and Hopkins are both most likely to finish as WR#12, but Cobb has a tighter distribution (~100% probability of finishing between WR#8 and WR#16), whereas Hopkins has a wider distribution (~100% probability of finishing between WR#4 and WR#20). Or different skew might be possible, so that Cobb's range is the same, but Hopkins has a  50% probability of finishing between WR#8 and WR#12 and a 50% chance of finishing somewhere between WR#13 and WR#30. This is different than your point about confidence intervals, as we might want to know the shape of each player's distribution of possible outcomes, not just the range that includes 95% of the possible outcomes. For the second skewed Hopkins example, giving a confidence interval of WR#8 to WR#30 is missing out on some crucial information that knowing the full distribution gives you: he is more likely than not to finish at WR#13 or better! Does that make sense? Here's a very simple figure showing what I mean: Cobb's distribution is Gaussian with mean at WR#12, Hopkins is given by a gamma distribution with mean at WR#12, but the gamma is not symmetrical about the mean, such that the mode is WR#10.5. http://i.imgur.com/QhoLBdQ.png If your model simply says ""what is the mean expected position"", they would be equivalent, but there is more information here than just that.  Anyway, I am enjoying reading your thoughts about the modeling, keep up the interesting work! :)"
DynastyFF,3db3ey,hokiepride,3,Wed Jul 15 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"On the first point, I'll admit that I'm not very familiar with generalized linear models in practice. Perhaps I should have given them mention, but the proposal of neural networks and non-parametric models was more to say that there are a variety of different ways we can model these players and we shouldn't just confine ourselves to a specific paradigm. As it's sometimes said, ""The proof is in the pudding."" I do hope to do some write-ups on different models and statistics touched on in this series once I finish it, but part of my motivation for this series is also to attract others to this aim and conversation.   On your second point, I do agree with that. Introducing confidence/credible intervals was not really intended to be a definitive approach but an example of one. Even if your model does give a distribution and it can be more useful in many ways, confidence intervals might be seen as more intuitive, and they are still used by many sources."
DynastyFF,3db3ey,aussiemac24,2,Wed Jul 15 20:05:16 2015 UTC,Nonparametric and semiparametric modeling are actually not terribly difficult to do when you take a Bayesian approach.

I'm totally willing to admit I'm just not seeing it but I don't quite understand what your end goal is. The most I can get out of it at this is just that players should be seen as a range of goodness or badness and this should be a constantly updated evaluation.  I want to stress, I'm not trying to insult you or your work. I'm new to dynasty, so I think that might have something to do with it.

You have the leverage if that's the case. If he wants to do Olsen for Robinson, I feel like he needs to add in at least a 2nd round pick. If you're in win now, then I don't think you can afford that. As /u/PaoloPWD mentioned, Gates/Walker would make more sense. Maybe Walker+4th? I don't think Denard is worth a 3rd Rd straight up, personally."

Gronk is younger, in a much more scarce position, gives you a bigger advantage at his position than any WR, and doesn't have the question marks with both Peyton retiring and DT potentially getting franchised and then becoming a FA (and potentially doing something like Julius Thomas and downgrading his situation quite a bit). Even with his question marks, I expect DT will be a top 10 WR in 2016, but closer to WR#10 than WR#1.

DynastyFF,3dbu6y,LamanamanumiReborn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:34:23 2015 UTC,I'd honestly move him now. he's lost Jimmy + Stills and that offense is gonna be more run-based than anything. IDK what value you can get for him... maybe try selling him and Colston to someone who's in uber win now mode.

DynastyFF,3dbu6y,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:47:12 2015 UTC,Andre Johnson is worth more than either of them IMO. If you could get one of those guys with a pick then maybe

DynastyFF,3da495,mattmurf77,3,Tue Jul 14 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"I'd look to move up or trade for early 1st round picks. You don't need WRs but you're desperate at RB.   Ideally you'd take Gurley/Gordon/Yeldon/Coleman in this draft to improve your RB core. If you can't get into the top half of the first round then look for Yeldon/Abdullah/Coleman at 1.08 and Coleman/Duke Johnson/Ajai at 2.02. Then use later picks on guys like David Johnson/Cobb/Rawls (although you can probably get him as UDFA).  Your best bet imo would be to trade Calvin for 1.01 and something else like 2.01 (assuming non-snake), take Gurley at 1.01 and Yeldon 1.08. In that scenario you're much better off at RB, then load up on WRs."
DynastyFF,3da495,Therealcodyg,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. Trading away megatron for the top pick and still having Jeffery, ODB, Bryant as your starting WR's is solid. You may not contend this year, but you'll be set up for awhile."
DynastyFF,3da495,Fantasy_Phanatic,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't be mad at that WR core at all...especially in a 12 TM league.   Sucks that someone has picks 1.01-1.04 though. If that guy plays his cards right, he could be set for a loooooong time. I'd grab Gurley/Gordon/Cooper/Parker and tell the rest of the league to suck it."
DynastyFF,3da495,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:15 2015 UTC,Sorry for the confusion.. I meant all 4 teams with the top 4 picks are desperate for RB not one team haha

DynastyFF,3da495,Therealcodyg,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"I just pulled off a 3 team trade to acquire picks 1.01, 1.05 and 1.06 during my rookie draft. I thought I was ballin outta control...this would be on another level."
DynastyFF,3da495,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:00:25 2015 UTC,Hahaha wow! What'd you have to give up for that?
DynastyFF,3da495,Therealcodyg,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"Let me preface by saying, my team is in impeccable shape and, as a UGA fan, I wanted Gurley in the worst way. I also hate owning Lamar Miller and was indifferent toward Kelvin.   I had 1.06, 1.10, 2.01 to begin.  I traded 1.10 and 2.01 for 1.05/2016 1st rounder. Leaving me with 1.05 & 1.06 this year.  Then traded Benjamin for 1.03. Giving me 1.03, 1.05, 1.06.   Final move was 1.03/Lamar Miller for 1.01/Tre Mason/2.10/3.01  Ended up taking Gurley (with Tre as insurance), Parker, Agholor, David Johnson, Darren Waller, Buck Allen and Justin Hardy."
DynastyFF,3da495,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:44 2015 UTC,So if I read that right you traded 1.10 2.1 benjamin and miller for gurley parker mason 2.10 and 3.1? I would say that is an awesome trade for you man.. You got the better RB in the trade for sure and quite possibly the better WR (most definitely skill wise). Good for you man
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"I wish I could pull off moving up, I'm just having trouble getting anyone to part with their picks.. My worry is that the teams with all top 4 picks in the draft desperately need RBs and I wouldn't be that surprised to see 1-4 go gurley gordon yeldon coleman. Obviously those would be bad picks but i know the owners and I wouldn't be that surprised to see this happen."
DynastyFF,3da495,OP85,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be rough, but you'd be in decent shape just taking BPA there, which would amount to someone like Agholor/Parker/White. Not ideal, but when he's hurting for WR help, you take him to the cleaner.  There is decent talent to be had later. Duke Johnson, Buck Allen, Abdullah, Rawls...Those are all guys who could fall to you in the 2nd.   Throw out the trade offer, but don't give up too much. Tell him he can upgrade WR now and still get a top back with his insane number of top-end picks...you just want a piece of that pie and are willing to pay a reasonable price for it. Don't give up Calvin for 1.03 if Gurley/Gordon go 1-2, at least I wouldn't.  Edit: FWIW - Don't trade Calvin for Cooks straight up. That would be a mistake and you don't need to trade WR for WR, you're solid there."
DynastyFF,3da495,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:58 2015 UTC,Yeah that's probably what I'll end up doing.. I really like Coleman but I don't feel the need to trade up for him. Who is rawls? Seen his name pop up a few times but can't figure out who that is
DynastyFF,3da495,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"You won't need to trade up for Coleman, if you like him, it's perfectly acceptable to take him at 1.08.   Thomas Rawls is a RB who's making some waves in Seattle. Looking more and more (at least based on beat writers and reports) likely that he'll be in contention for the backup role...pushing Christine out of that slot. Good spot to be in since Marshawn is always threatening to retire."
DynastyFF,3da495,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:52:39 2015 UTC,Normally I wouldn't but I really think gurley gordon yeldon coleman are gonna go 1-4 just because of all of those teams needs.. The though of Parker falling to 8 is certainly exciting too.
DynastyFF,3da495,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"Parker at 8 is a steal, don't sweat it. If that happens you go hard at RB for the remainder of the draft."
DynastyFF,3da495,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:06:41 2015 UTC,Yup will do.. As mentioned above I'm not completely against winston at 2.2 though.. I just think his talent is so rare and he has the supporting cast to be great immediately (even though I don't think he will).
DynastyFF,3da495,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 14 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"I really doubt RBs go first 4 in a dynasty draft, especially PPR. Cooper and White will be gone by the 5th pick. If they aren't then draft BPA and laugh at the owners next year."

DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,3,Tue Jul 14 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"Your team isn't bad, but the obvious need is definitely RB. Cooks for Megatron isn't  a bad trade to make, but it would be better if you could deal Calvin Johnson for Lacy, or Megatron + a pick or 2 for Bell. that way you can bolster up your RB corps...  in the rookie draft the obvious answer is to hope that yeldon is there for you at 1.8, if he isn't, I wouldn't reach for another RB, I'd probably take a guy like Parker, Agholor, or Perriman instead. At 2.2 you should look at Tevin Coleman or Abdullah. Definitely look at Duke Johnson with the 2.7 if he's there. In all honesty I'd probably take 2/3 of Duke Johnson, David Johnson, and Cobb at 2.7 and 2.8   Try dealing Calvin Johnson for  the 1.1 or for Cooks + the guys 1st rounder"
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.. I was trying to do something around lacy for johnson but am struggling to get that to come through.. The guy who was going to do cooks for johnson is the same one who have 1.1 and has no interest in trading it for Johnson unfortunately.. I was thinking of offering Johnson for another young RB like Hyde or hill, but can't decide if that would be fair straight up or if something would have to be added"
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:31 2015 UTC,Hyde? No... You could make the argument for hill straight up though.  Why dont you offer Calvin and the 2.2 for Cooks and the 1.1?

DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,3,Tue Jul 14 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"You have Bridgewater, so there's virtually no reason to draft Winston. I would be looking at value RBs or WRs there instead."
DynastyFF,3da495,Fantasy_Phanatic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"I guess, but Winston definitely has a lot more upside than teddy and for a 2nd round draft pick price. Him evans and sefarian-jenkins could be a force for the next 10 years easily"
DynastyFF,3da495,bconbucks,2,Tue Jul 14 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"Does he actually have more upside, or is he just more unknown? Those aren't the same thing.  Bridgewater showed a lot of flashes by the time the season ended. With the exception of Andrew Luck-type prospects, I'm not sure any QB can be expected to do more coming into the league."
DynastyFF,3da495,bconbucks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:28:25 2015 UTC,Yeah that's fair on the unknown point. Todd Mcshay was quoted that Winston was the most skilled QB he saw since Luck so I think there is definitely an argument to make for Winston being top 5 in a year or two. He also has better weapons than Bridgewater although he doesn't have AP in the backfield.
DynastyFF,3da495,Brad227,2,Tue Jul 14 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"I definitely see a lot of Andrew Luck in him, but moreso because of his build rather than his college performance. I'm really worried by his interceptions last year. Then again, Luck had a shit ton of turnovers in his rookie year (and more than his fair share last year) and his volume made up for it for fantasy points."
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:34 2015 UTC,Yeah.. That's what I don't know.. Might pull the trigger if I can execute a Calvin for a solid RB
DynastyFF,3da495,Brad227,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is that you should go full rebuild here. I don't think you have what it takes to compete this year, but you have some great building blocks for the future. IMO, here are your best trade assets and their values:   Calvin - For whatever reason, this guy is tremendously undervalued currently. I wouldn't sell him for anything less than Randall Cobb which should equate to around 3x1st rounders. If that means waiting a few weeks into the season then so be it. If you want Lacy, you should be able to get him for Calvin straight up. If that is truly your guy, then I would only be willing to throw in a 3rd rd pick at most. I think you'd be on the wrong end of Jeremy Hill Straight up and I wouldn't even counter a trade asking Calvin for Hyde straight up. Gronk - As painful as it may be to let go of him, you can also demand a bounty for him right now. Sell high! Some people value him as the highest of all due to the gap between him and #2 TE to be so large now that Graham is gone. Remember, this time last year people thought he may not be able to come back. I'd try to get Gates/Green + 1st + 2nd that way you preserve your TE position while building depth   You sell those 2 pieces, and you should be able to get a mix of young current NFL talent, some picks this year, and next year. With ODB and Jeffery, you really only need one more young WR since you also have Percy/Bryant. I would focus on getting some solid RB talent (AP might even make sense since you also have McKinnon) and even trying to upgrade QB. I think Teddy could be awesome, but just in case!"
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused.. Why would I want to go after AP if you suggest going into full rebuild? I appreciate the rest of the advice. The though of trading Gronk is tough because I am a pats fan, but you make a really good point here."
DynastyFF,3da495,Brad227,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"Good point. I was just thinking for locking up the MIN backfield now through the future. Although, I won't be shocked when AP is still top 5 in 5 years. He is insane."
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that definitely makes sense, just think it would be silly to overpay for AP rather than just work on stockpiling assets. I was definitely looking at him if I can get him for the right price."
DynastyFF,3da495,Brad227,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:46 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Good luck! Let me know how it works out. I recently traded Calvin in a 2QB league at what I feel is the right value. I received Bradford+Cobb+2016 2nd Rd for Rivers+Calvin.
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:58 2015 UTC,Yeah id be happy with that value.. Cobb and a 2nd I would love
DynastyFF,3da495,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:12 2015 UTC,I view the trade more as Rivers = Bradford + 2nd round (favoring Rivers slightly) and Cobb=Calvin (favoring Cobb slightly). But I agree. I feel like we both got the right fit for our team. I feel I got a good deal and so does my trade partner.
DynastyFF,3da495,Brad227,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:36 2015 UTC,Ok I gotcha.. I'll see what the Cobb owner thinks.. Thanks for all the advice!
DynastyFF,3dal0a,meistersinger,4,Tue Jul 14 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Your counter is fair, Hill is only 22 and no one in their sane mind would give up Hill and 1.07 for AD."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,LUCIFERx88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"Do you think it shoots me in the foot as far as acquiring young RB talent goes?  I would almost rather hang on to AD, but as a team in a rebuild, that seems to be pissing away his value."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,LUCIFERx88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:46 2015 UTC,"Essentially you're giving AD + Funchess? + a lottery ticket for Hill. Take Hill all day (no pun intended). AD really only has 3 years tops left in him at best. Here is a link to career carries. I understand that AD sat a year but I just can't see him playing at an elite level for more than 3 years and this coming from someone who loves both of these backs more than 90% of this sub. Hill will be a perennial 1st-2nd round redraft pick potentially for 5+ years. Maybe I overvalue that but I think it is crucial to have an RB 1 to win a championship and Hill, Bell, Lacy, and potentially Gurley will give you that for 5+ years each imo."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,klassicd,2,Tue Jul 14 21:37:36 2015 UTC,AD and the 2.02 for Hill would be a better starting point.
DynastyFF,3dal0a,wolf_nipple_chips,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:53 2015 UTC,I'm thinking this as well.
DynastyFF,3dal0a,quickonthedrawl,0,Tue Jul 14 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"Um, yeah. That would be a nice deal except Hill is basically equal value to AP at this point."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,Therealcodyg,2,Wed Jul 15 10:29:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Unless you know the guy is crazy for Peterson, I think you need to accept this without a counter. You're already getting crazy good value for a guy that I'd personally put closer to 1.10-1.12 at best.  The guys here saying to ask for Hill and a first rounder are actually crazy! That could never happen in a competitive league, for what it's worth. Any trade involving Hill for Peterson is going to require you to kick in a first round pick, at the very least."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,MrLinderman,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"Your counter offer is too rich in my opinion. At bare minimum I'd ask for 1.07/Hill for AD as a counter. And I might not even do that deal.  I know it seems like a crazy proposal, but AD has, in my estimation, a LOT of tread left of the tires. Remember, he's the best back in the league, who has superhuman traits, and has sat out 2 seasons."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,Therealcodyg,5,Tue Jul 14 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me?  Hill alone >>AD   He hasn't played in a year, and is at the age where rbs fall off a cliff. He has MAYBE 2 good years left. Very very few RBs  remain relevant after 30, let alone a stud."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,MrLinderman,0,Tue Jul 14 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not kidding you.  AD missing a season to a non-injury isn't relevant imo. You're judging him based on other RBs, when he's clearly demonstrated that's a bad idea.   You've seen Hill for 1 year, albeit a good season. But you have no clue how the snaps will be divided between him and Gio this season, its all speculation."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,tnicholson8,4,Tue Jul 14 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"Look at DLFs  rankings. Hill is ranked 27. AP is ranked 60. Come on guys, be realistic."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,LUCIFERx88,0,Tue Jul 14 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"I agree. AD is the exception to the rule. I may be proved wrong this year, but gambling on AD is always the safe bet. He's once in a lifetime."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,Therealcodyg,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"He's sat out 1 season, not sure what the other one you're referring to is..."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,blardorg,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"You're right...I forgot about his superhuman ability to recover from injuries, didn't miss that season.   Really though, compare his games played and carries to retired elite backs. If you assume he'll produce similarly, he's got 4-5 top five season left. I'll take that AD over Hill every time."
DynastyFF,3dal0a,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:47:04 2015 UTC,"We're both Vikings fans, so we're both pretty high on AD.  1.07+Hill intrigues me as it gives me the flexibility to go BPA at 1.02 and 1.07 since I would have some young talent at both WR and RB.   I wholeheartedly agree that he's the best RB in the league, but part of me wants to sell high on him.  I'm not opposed to hanging on to him at all, but if I can get some value out of a 30-year old RB that's not a bad thing at all."
DynastyFF,3dakwu,slodanslodan,3,Tue Jul 14 19:59:20 2015 UTC,"Abdullah pick jumps out, but I'm starting to see that a lot.

DynastyFF,3dakwu,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"Lots of teams with similar records, thats a good thing!   Similar points-for as well. There is a lot of parity, which actually makes it harder to make championship pushes since there aren't any total rebuilds walking around selling studs or sell-out-for-the-win teams selling cheap picks. There are a couple teams that overvalue QB and a couple more that are overvaluing RB so I think the next couple seasons will change that as those teams create a lowest tier."
DynastyFF,3dakwu,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think that's a common occurrence (or should be) in a competitive league. Most owners dont come into a new league and say ""yeah im loosing this year"" Unless you know what you are doing (or think you do).

Mason's future is very up in the air, if Gurley is what we think he is Mason isn't going to see a ton of work once Gurley gets back. i do like Morris, but he's had quite a workload the past few years and could start to slow down. West is meh, he didn't really show much last year, and with the drafting of Duke West is probably going to be mostly a backup. How are his WRs?"
DynastyFF,3dakwu,burms,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"Solid. Cobb, Watkins, Hopkins, Wallace. Niles Paul and Owen Daniels at TE is no good, and Brady at QB is an unexpected problem."
DynastyFF,3dakwu,burms,2,Tue Jul 14 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"RB seems like more of a need than WR, so I can see the Abdullah pick. I probably would have tried to trade back a few picks though. Paul and Daniels is pretty poor at TE, but that's way too early for Maxx Williams, and he's a bit of a question mark anyway. I think Brady will be fine this year, even if the suspension isn't completely overturned he'll probably challenge it in court and get an injunction delaying the suspension until the case is over, which probably won't be until after the season ends."

DynastyFF,3db5fs,Troop-the-Loop,2,Tue Jul 14 22:23:33 2015 UTC,well you obviously won't deal the  2.11 and 3.11.... I think I'd be comfortable with losing the 3.11 and 4.11 for the 1.11  You're giving up the 43rd and 59th pick I think for the 11th? I'll definitely do that
DynastyFF,3db5fs,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Wed Jul 15 00:46:21 2015 UTC,I think that's a good trade. Pick 11 for 40 and 60 approximately. That's great value!
DynastyFF,3db5fs,aussiemac24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"In a 16 team league I wouldn't do either trade. Having two studs would be great, but it would be tough to lose another great player with the loss of a 3rd or 4th round pick. Talent will be thin in a 16 team league without trading early picks."
DynastyFF,3db5fs,Swisscheese1021,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"I think I would be okay losing the 3rd and 4th in a 16 teamer. You replace one of them with 1.11 so you're really only losing one player. In 16 team leagues, two studs would absolutely carry you.   If I were you, I would just be sure to take a RB and a WR. (Unless it's a 2 QB league) because when you pick in the 5th there will be a lot less talent at those positions."
DynastyFF,3d8sw2,Ccm120,8,Tue Jul 14 11:57:23 2015 UTC,"Is this 1QB or 2QB? If this is 1QB, you have to do this if you're trying to rebuild. That's awesome value."
DynastyFF,3d8sw2,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:23:16 2015 UTC,100% agree here.  Aging QBs are notoriously difficult to move.  This is more value than I've seen in a while for a QB if you are in a 1 QB league.

DynastyFF,3d8ros,jujumo,13,Tue Jul 14 11:42:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a wrong answer here. I'd say ODB has higher total upside, but Brown has been incredibly consistent for the last 2 years, so he'd be the safer pick."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,aussiemac24,7,Tue Jul 14 11:49:36 2015 UTC,"This answer nails it. It comes down to philosophy, if you want crazy upside, go OBJ, If you want the safer thing take Brown. I'm taking Brown every time."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,Sticky_Z,10,Tue Jul 14 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"Brown just put up 129-1698-13. If you're in full PPR, that beats out Megatron's best years, that beats Randy Moss's 23 TD season by 1 point, beat all of Marvin Harrison's seasons, etc. I get that OBJ has sky high potential, but Brown is already there! Brown's sitting on a cloud taunting OBJ to get on his level. It is realistically almost impossible for any WR to significantly outperform what Brown just did, so it doesn't really make sense to say ""pick OBJ for upside, pick Brown for the safer thing."" You pick Brown for upside and safety.  Edit: And just to add one more thing. If you project OBJ's 12 games to a full 16 game season, assuming he can keep up that pace for an entire season, he would've scored... 7 total points more in the season than Brown. Yeah OBJ's a rookie and yeah he had a ridiculous 12 game stretch, but I feel like somehow Brown's almost equally ridiculous year went under the radar a bit."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,blardorg,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:09 2015 UTC,This is the correct response. Take a step back and realize you're comparing set-in-stone proven superstar to a guy who has played 12 games. It's Antonio 10/10.
DynastyFF,3d8ros,mtbike,6,Wed Jul 15 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Beckham, Jr., but if you're limiting the time frame to 3 years, then it's pretty indisputable that Antonio Brown has to be the better choice. His last couple of seasons is basically what any receivers' scoring ceiling is."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"Easily Brown. I don't believe that OBJ's ceiling is much higher than Brown's in terms of points scored, and his floor is quite a bit lower, just on account of Brown being the ultimate in consistency. In terms of position rank, OBJ will at worst be a high end WR2 (say, WR#12-15) in my opinion, and at best WR#1... Brown has already shown he can be WR#1 across a season, and at worst will be something like WR#5 or 6. Obviously assuming no injuries for either one, of course."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,blardorg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I like the use of the phrase ""stuck with"" when referring to these guys! ;)  As a WR to build around I'd take OBJesus solely for the extra years he has on AB.  If I've already got a solid team, I'd prefer Brown."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,LastOfTheOsirans,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:53 2015 UTC,"For 3 years? I assume its a contract league then. Give me Brown 10/10 times. Dudes money in the bank for that stretch of time in one of the most consistent offenses in the league.  OBJ MAY be as good as Brown, but if its a 3 year window I'm taking the sure thing in AB every single time."
DynastyFF,3d8ros,Cavemansol,0,Tue Jul 14 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"I feel better about brown because of his consistency over the past couple years, but fortunately I don't have to choose between the two and can have them both. In my mind that's better because I have one for consistency and one for his upside."
DynastyFF,3dao3m,scott_4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:21:07 2015 UTC,I like the Yeldon pick for sure. I think Kelce might be a steal if he is still there. Would totally fix your TE situation. Your WR's are pretty stacked. Yeldon should come in as the starter and its an offense that I personally believe will impress
DynastyFF,3dao3m,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"I like Yeldon as well. I think Johnson will tear it up, but i truly don't need another WR. I'm thinking Yeldon and then keeping my fingers crossed that Kelce, Olson, Daniels, or even D. Walker make it to round two. I have picks 2.4, 2.10, and 3.1 as well. Could probably get one of those TE's there you think? If Yeldon is gone for some reason you think i go Kelce at 7?"
DynastyFF,3dao3m,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:28 2015 UTC,I think you should do that. I actually like Johnson for ending up back at 2.04 honestly. Some people are really over looking him. Otherwise yeah 100% one of those TE's make it. The rookies will make them keep falling.
DynastyFF,3dao3m,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"That't a very good point about 2.4. I got Cobb there last year because of people going rookie heavy. 7 of the 10 teams in the 1st round love rookies, myself included. I think if Yeldon is gone that TE is the most important need on my roster. I can start 4 WR's and 1 RB until one of the rookie RB's i take at 3 come along. So you like Kelce more than the other TE's i mentioned? I think i can get Daniels later, but i think he'll be good this year."
DynastyFF,3dao3m,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah Daniels will be good this year, Kelce gets you more long term value and will likely score more or very close to daniels. I like Olson also, but would rather have Kelce. They are super close for me. 31 year old Walker im not too thrilled about at all"
DynastyFF,3dao3m,greebytime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i have a hard time trusting any Titan players for a year or so. Olson will certainly be there at pick 2.4 if i end up getting Yeldon. I think Daniels will as well. Not too sure about Kelce with all the hype he's getting. Let me ask you this. If Yeldon, Gurley, and Gordon are all gone. You think i take a different rookie RB at 7? I don't see 1st round upside on any other rookie RB's. Too many of them will share carries in my opinion. With Gordon, Gurley, and Yeldon i think they're the bell cow guys if not right away then mid season."
DynastyFF,3dalgy,blackngold14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"1QB? Gotta think he is like 1.12 at a minimum wouldnt pay more than that tho. Would maybe take like 2.02 if I had plenty of other QB's. You gotta imagine you could replace him with Winston at 1.12. Talking 16 team, used to 12 team so I might be a bit off. I would prolly hold him tho, his value is only going to go up this year in my mind ..oh you said 2016 picks. Yeah I would jump for joy for a 1st...a 2nd would have to come from a bottom half team. but like I said, He is a hold unless I have a ton of QB's"
DynastyFF,3dalgy,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:19:41 2015 UTC,Owner also has Russell Wilson. I offered 2016 1st from a team that drafted a bunch of rookies and he thinks he can get more. I doubt that very much

DynastyFF,3dalgy,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:49:32 2015 UTC,Wow for once we differ on values. I would have said more like 1.08 or 1.09 depending on each team's needs and who is on the board. Really love Tannyhill. Think he'll easily cost more in 12 months
DynastyFF,3dalgy,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:33 2015 UTC,Even in 1QB? I totally love him too(20%+ league share) but think I would rather have Abdullah or shit even Strong than a QB at 12th overall. I guess 16 teams make it a bit more scarce. So I can see it from that regard
DynastyFF,3d9l3e,JJkling23,2,Tue Jul 14 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"You have a win now team, so I'd use some of those picks to trade for another QB and a stud WR to ensure you the title this year.   Edit * Win now, and later, so try to get some younger players."

DynastyFF,3dag9k,edotvee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of ways you can go with this, I think. However, if you don't think you can compete this year, I might start rebuilding (don't know if you'd be able to compete for a chip or not myself). A lot of your guys are old or past/at their peak. They might have 2-3 years of good points in them, but if you're not winning in those years, you're gonna be kind of screwed if none of these guys move (I'm mostly looking at QBs and Forsett here.)   The point Id start from here is gauging interest in your older guys. If you can't sell them for the right price, you could at least hold on until the season to see if one of them catches fire, and then sell him while he's hot. Of course, if a couple of your guys take off, you could be a contender, so you should consider staying put.   The one thing I wouldn't do is move DT unless you really like the offer. He's your only true long term stud.   This is all coming from a pretty inexperienced dynasty player, so take it how you will.   Just realized none of this dealt with the actual draft, sorry."
DynastyFF,3dag9k,sg3751,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of my guys are around their peak, at RB especially, but I feel like they're all RB2s (Forsett/Ingram/Vereen) which is why I'm not sure about competing this year. There hasn't been a lot of trading in the league so I'm not sure how easily I'll move my older guys.  EDIT: Oh and I'm sure you're more experienced than me!"
DynastyFF,3dag9k,sg3751,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"The reason I was considering moving DT was that I don't think his value will ever be higher than it is now. If I'm going to rebuild then I want to get as much for him as I can. It would take a lot though, like in the 3 firsts range."
DynastyFF,3dag9k,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:06:27 2015 UTC,"I think that's a pretty good approach to it. Not a very popular opinion, I think, but I also agree on DT's value."
DynastyFF,3dag9k,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"Just my humble opinion, but I really don't like Perriman. Yes he's fast, but he doesn't have good hands. He reminds me a ton of Stephen Hill   As far as your team, it's really hard to say. You have good balance.  You have a lot of high variable, hard to predict people though. Gio, Ingram, Forsett, Vereen, and McKinnon all could be very productive or extremely frustrating! You WR corps look strong. I think Garcon will have a bounce back year and as a WR3, that would be awesome!  Here are my humble suggestions:   Go for AP - You have McKinnon, so it makes sense. The price is what has to be right. I'd be happy to sell Gio for AP straight up in your position.  Next, I'd try to get Ellington and draft David Johnson. That way you own 2 legit RB backfields for the future.    As far as your draft picks, I feel like 1.11 is reaching for D. Johnson, but I'd hate to trade back to 2.3 and someone take him. I would draft Waller with your 3.11 if you like Perriman/Baltimore situation.   EDIT: If you're in win-now mode, I'd try to hold on to Forsett. He should be a top 10 back, possibly top 5, as long as he stays healthy. I also don't know that I'd deal Vereen prior to the season, unless someone is willing to pay for his upside."
DynastyFF,3dac9b,FluckyU,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"BPA....Always BPA. If you had Julio/AB/OBJ/Dez/AJG/Evans as your starting WR's and Strong is sitting there at 2.03, you take him, since he is the best player available. Melvin at 1.03 is great"
DynastyFF,3dac9b,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 14 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed.. Always go with who you think will be the best NFL player. Worst case, if you don't need him you can use the value to get exactly what you do need."
DynastyFF,3dac9b,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"You're correct with your assumption at 1.03, unless you can package another pick or two and move up to 1.01 for Gurley.  If not, I'd go strong at RBs. Take Gordon at 1.03 assuming Gurley/Cooper go before. Then Grab guys like Yeldon, Coleman, Abdullah, Duke, David Johnson, Ajayi, CAP, Buck Allen, Cobb.  I realize some likely won't be available at 2.03 and 3.03, but those are the guys I'd target."
DynastyFF,3d9eza,swinglinefan,3,Tue Jul 14 15:11:40 2015 UTC,"Looks like you're in full rebuild. I honestly think you could get more for Forsett. This really depends how you view David Cobb though. To me, he hasn't beating out Sankey yet. Forsett was a top 10 back last year and could be a top 5 this year (He beat out Miller, Hill, CJAnderson, Morris, Ingram, etc.) I honestly think you should be able to get at least a first round pick for him. I'd wait it out and maybe deal him after the season starts to someone who feels they are an RB1 away from the championship. At a minimum, I'd counter with Cobb and the 2.04."

DynastyFF,3d9eza,wolf_nipple_chips,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:39 2015 UTC,How then does he have rookies to trade and you have yet to draft?
DynastyFF,3d9eza,klassicd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:38:36 2015 UTC,When I said the same league I meant the same league settings.
DynastyFF,3d9eza,Therealcodyg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do that deal. I'd actually hang on to Forsett to see what he does early and perhaps deal him for a 1st to someone who's right on the brink and missing a starting RB for some reason.   I'm not particularly high on Forsett, but you're doing alright in the rookie RB department and adding Cobb/3rd isn't really doing much for you. For instance, Cobb didn't go until the 3rd in my rookie draft, which means you're essentially getting two 3rds for Forsett.   If you're set on dealing him, maybe counter with Forsett/3rd for Cobb/1st. Maybe your trade partner will concede or counter with Cobb/2nd, in which case you come back with Forsett/2nd for Cobb/1st.  TL;DR : I'm with you in thinking you're not getting enough right now for Forsett."
DynastyFF,3d9eza,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:00 2015 UTC,I also like your trade counter. Forsett+3rd for Cobb+1st is a really good starting place if you're high on Cobb.  You da real cody g
DynastyFF,3da8yw,UnderAchievingDog,2,Tue Jul 14 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"I think I'd shy away from any of these trades. You're team is looking good.   If you're just set on moving DT and/or CJ, and I wouldn't blame you as I'm adverse to owning them, I'd ask for much more. Make someone mortgage their future for one of those guys.   You have the leverage since you don't need to move anyone."
DynastyFF,3da8yw,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"The guy with ODB/Brown is pretty knowledgeable at Fantasy as well, and is one of the other guys in the league whos going for the chip, he also has Cooper, the ""Megatrade"" He just offered me was DT + CJ for Brown + Miller, which I can counter with Brown+Cooper since I don't need the RB help, but I'm unsure if that's worth it, I'd really prefer ODB to Brown in the first place."
DynastyFF,3da8yw,Wetzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:12:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'd make any of those trades. Anderson and Ball for Cooper and a 2nd might be a good trade, but in non-ppr I think Cooper is a bit riskier. I'd probably just stay with what you have, that's a pretty sweet team."
DynastyFF,3da8yw,Wetzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:00:12 2015 UTC,Do you think I could move Cooper for a more proven asset that would help my team?
DynastyFF,3da8yw,Wetzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"Any help you get is going to be marginal at best. You've already got the top QB and TE, 3 top 10 WRs, the #1 RB, another top 5 RB, and two top 15 RBs, one of which (cj anderson) I think has top 5 upside, at least as long as Manning is around. Unless you have a trade in place for Cooper that greatly improves your team I wouldn't risk it."
DynastyFF,3da8yw,Fantasy_Phanatic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"What type of value do you think I could get for Cooper? I can dangle out some trades to people, I can see if I can't turn Cooper into Lacy."
DynastyFF,3da8yw,Ballinandfallin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"There's no way you'll get Cooper for Lacy, and I don't actually think Lacy is that much of improvement over Anderson, though I'm higher and Anderson than most."
DynastyFF,3d8wcr,dparsons182,2,Tue Jul 14 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"Hi, I've been invited to a dynasty league my friend is starting. I've only played DFS. Can you give me some tips for switching over?   Also I've heard a lot about going RB in the first round. Would you say this is true for dynasty. If so, would a Le'Veon Bell be better than Peterson for youth? If not, a youngish Rodgers, or a young franchise WR? I'm in a barely PPR league (.25pts/rec.).  Thanks!"
DynastyFF,3d8wcr,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"Check this out for some reference: Dynasty Rankings  Here are things you need to realize with dynasty and draft values:  1) What is your mindset (Win now, Building for future, best available, etc.)  2) League format (2QB has a completely different priority on QBs than 1QB. In a 10 team league, 1QB leaves minimal value to QB, but 2QB is entirely different, especially in dynasty!)  3) General Dynasty Position Value - WR is almost always the most valuable due to PPR formats and consistent/long-term production. Conversely, RBs are held to a lower value due to injury proneness, 30-phobia, and the changing landscape in NFL (RBBC, pass happy). TE is probably the most varied. Gronk demands top 5 overall value, but Olsen demands significantly less.   Hope that helps, and good luck!  EDIT: In summary, Bell could be a decent first round (late) pick, but I wouldn't go for AP in the first couple rounds. Instead, I'd look at young, productive WRs like Brown, Bryant, Julio etc. Even WRs like Hopkins/Watkins should go before AP. Remember, this is a team you will have 5 years from now."
DynastyFF,3d8wcr,dparsons182,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:30:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks!

DynastyFF,3d8wcr,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I would expect 7 WRs, 1TE, 2RBs, and 2QBs to get drafted round 1. Luck is 1st and Rodgers 2nd at QB. After the 1st round, I wouldn't expect QBs to go until later. I'd be very happy with Matt Ryan at QB if that meant I got stud young WRs. But, Rodgers/Luck wouldn't be a bad cornerstone either."

DynastyFF,3d98nc,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 14 14:24:13 2015 UTC,Osweiler 10/10. He will get a real shot at the job before anyone else. There is a reason Elway drafted him. Clearly he likes something there. Greyson might not see the field for another 3+ years...Brees said he would be playing for awhile yet
DynastyFF,3d98nc,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 14 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"Brock Lobster easily. The job is his to lose once Peytons gone. Drew isn't going anywhere anytime soon in NO, and by the time he does go there will probably be a newer and more exciting prospect to replace him."

DynastyFF,3d8spw,sicknarlo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you are actually in a better position than most people who think they know a lot. While there have been some great resources shared already, the one thing I will emphasize is trust the list. Don't get cute jumping around, don't worry about trying to fill out a starting roster. Print your list (www.dynastyleaguefootball.com is where I'd recommend), cross out names as they go, and take the best player left every round, regardless of position. Passing on good assets because you don't have a TE yet by the 4th or 5th round is a good way to hamstring your team early on."
DynastyFF,3d8spw,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"Some quick strategy tips:  Don't go with rookies or older veterans in the early rounds (seems obvious but I've seen it happen...Forte was the #1 pick in my recent .5ppr startup ಠ_ಠ), stick to younger guys who are established, i.e. L.Bell, OBJ, Dez, Julio, AJG  Grab the high-rated rookies once you see the established guys fall off a cliff. Don't reach for someone like Vincent Jackson/Mike Wallace when Cooper/Gurley are on the board.  Load up on RBs. There are tons of great WRs out there, make sure you get some great talent at RB if you can. That being said, if you're picking at the turn, don't hesitate to grab Dez/AJG, just be sure you grab Gurley/Gordon/Yeldon a round early. In that scenario you'll also want to target someone like Gore to help you out this year.  If you grab Gurley, grab Mason.   I'm in a WR/RB/TE flex league, and I prefer to have the advantage at TE. I recently grabbed Graham at a great price...but Bennett was sitting there super late, snapped him up...6 rounds later Allen was too good of a steal so I grabbed him too. Lesson here, don't neglect TE or the strategy of playing one in your flex. I dominated a PPR league 2 years ago with Gronk/Graham BOTH in my weekly lineup.  Do some reading in /r/fantasyfootball to help you figure out which young players you want to target late. I'm looking at you, ASJ, Hardy, CAP.  Honestly, if you want some additional guidance, hit me up via PM."
DynastyFF,3d8spw,m_plis,3,Tue Jul 14 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"Don't reach for someone like Vincent Jackson/Mike Wallace when Cooper/Gurley are on the board.   I highly doubt that's a choice anyone in a startup in actually making. Those guys probably aren't worth more than mid-2nd round rookie picks.   Load up on RBs.   If you're going to load up on one position, WR is probably the one you want to go with, not RB. They tend to be less volatile from year to year and they have longer careers.    If you grab Gurley, grab Mason.   I mean, sure, if you can get Mason at a good price, but don't force it.   ...if you're picking at the turn, don't hesitate to grab Dez/AJG   Dez won't make it to the turn even in the smallest of leagues. AJG is more likely to make it there, and I agree that he should probably be taken if he makes it there.   ...just be sure you grab Gurley/Gordon/Yeldon a round early. In that scenario you'll also want to target someone like Gore to help you out this year.   Why? Just because you took a good WR with your first pick doesn't mean you should be reaching for a young RB or targeting a RB that might have 1-2 years of fantasy relevance left.   I'm in a WR/RB/TE flex league, and I prefer to have the advantage at TE.   Again, sure, if the value is there. If you can get Gronk in the late 1st and then Graham in the 3rd, go for it. Just realize that your other positions, likely WR, will take a hit."
DynastyFF,3d8spw,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that's a choice anyone in a startup in actually making. Those guys probably aren't worth more than mid-2nd round rookie picks.   This actually was a choice in my neighbor's recent startup. He is new to FF altogether, with similarly situated owners. He came by my place to ask about Wallace in the 6th during his slow-roll draft...every rookie was on the board. Not typical for seasoned FF players, sure, but worth noting to someone unfamiliar with the format. You have to remember your audience with posts like this. We aren't talking to someone familiar with the process and sometime not intimately familiar with CFB/NFL...it never hurts to spell it out and give examples for an unlikely situation.   If you're going to load up on one position, WR is probably the one you want to go with, not RB. They tend to be less volatile from year to year and they have longer careers.   I don't disagree with loading up on WRs, your roster should be almost all WR/RBs. But, given the volatility, you can spare a few extra roster spots on RBs to ensure you have startable options and trade chips when the volatility swings in your favor if you understand the position. For example, grabbing Knile in later rounds without having to ever start him allows you to trade that piece if Charles goes down for extended periods or if Knile hits FA. The key is to grab guys who are pushing the starter and/or have a shaky situation ahead of them.   I mean, sure, if you can get Mason at a good price, but don't force it.   I think this goes without saying and was assumed. However, I've seen people in this sub saying there is no reason to draft Mason, which is an error.   Dez won't make it to the turn even in the smallest of leagues. AJG is more likely to make it there, and I agree that he should probably be taken if he makes it there.    Again, this is completely speculative on your part. Obviously this was a mistake, but my recent startup had Forte, ODB, Luck, Julio, Rodgers, Bell, Gronk, AB, Lacy, Dez go in that order. I personally think a number of those picks were mistakes, but it happens. This is a post for someone who is unfamiliar with dynasty, he needs a good base of knowledge.   Why? Just because you took a good WR with your first pick doesn't mean you should be reaching for a young RB or targeting a RB that might have 1-2 years of fantasy relevance left.   That advice is for someone who largely punts RB early (probably a wording error on my part, I meant take Dez/AJG as picks 1.10/2.01). If that happens, my advice is to not reach for guys like Forsett, but rather go a round early for young talent at RB. Then get some help for this year with a guy like Gore.   Again, sure, if the value is there. If you can get Gronk in the late 1st and then Graham in the 3rd, go for it. Just realize that your other positions, likely WR, will take a hit.   Yes, you will obviously take a hit somewhere. It's my personal preference to have the clear advantage at TE. I wouldn't take him 7th overall with Dez/AJG on the board like my recent draft, but I'd consider it if they were picked instead of say, Luck/Rodgers in that scenario.   I'm definitely not saying my strategy is the only way to go, but it works for me. I prefer to stay young in dynasty leagues, trade off older pieces a year early for draft picks, and have good depth at RB. I find that RB is undervalued in dynasty startup drafts and become huge bargaining pieces as the year(s) go on. I watch a TON of CFB and have a great understanding of who has potential coming into the NFL, which is an advantage for me and why I prefer this strategy.  But, to each his own. Just trying to put a different strategy out there for someone who is just starting out. He can stick to the SOP of this sub if he'd like, obviously, but this is a place I come for varying viewpoints, which is what I try to provide with posts like this."
DynastyFF,3d8spw,udeuce,2,Tue Jul 14 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Disagree with most of this, but quality response! Upvoted for sure.  I think it's important not to overwhelm the person when you're giving information to a beginner. Some of your info, especially the devaluing of RBs (which I do too lol) is important to bring up. However, there's not too much point in telling him that he could be choosing between Gurley and Mike Wallace, because that isn't what will happen in a draft 9 times out of 10. Best to give advice that's widely applicable and let them dive into the nuances later."

Even though dez supposedly went at the turn in one of your leagues, you lost all credibility when you suggested that he could be available there. If it's a 1 qb league, I'd be shocked if he went outside the top 5. He's as close to a consensus number 1 as you can get."

DynastyFF,3d8awf,NeverTouchMyDrumset,2,Tue Jul 14 08:00:07 2015 UTC,"If you haven't made cuts yet, this could help free up some roster positions. I think Reggie is probably worth a 3 on his own, but I don't think Graham is worth anything. It doesn't really move the needle much for either one of you, but you don't have a whole lot of RB help. If you're in rebuild mode, why not."

DynastyFF,3d80kw,csmartin85,5,Tue Jul 14 05:55:14 2015 UTC,"You have a big need at QB, you have multiple starting RBs, and you're getting offered a young star QB for an old RB with 1-2 years left in the league (most likely) that are similarly valuable by consensus ADP. Oh and you're getting a probable top 20 RB too. Easy accept!"
DynastyFF,3d80kw,blardorg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:25:24 2015 UTC,"Based on DLF Wilson's ADP is 30 and Lynch's is 34 so they are close based on ADP with CJ spiller added on it looks like a good deal. You have Forte and Forsett as your 1 and 2 with a good likelihood that CJ or Jennings will become a reliable WR3 for you. Adding Wilson will help a lot going forward as Brady is aging. Also, I think the addition of Graham and Lockett with Paul Richardson coming back from injury, Wilson should continue to put up better passing numbers."
DynastyFF,3d80kw,Swisscheese1021,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is a fairly good trade, especially with CJ's PPR value. Your WR corps is honestly a good mix as Hilton, Perriman, and Funchess are all young. Obviously, if by mid-season your out of the running, you should be able to get a big payback on Jordy."
DynastyFF,3d80kw,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:55 2015 UTC,"I would definitely do this. While I think you'll be fine at QB (I'm betting Brady doesn't end up missing any games this season) Wilson is a top 5 Dynasty QB (DLF has him at #3) and CJ Spiller could have quite a few nice years in NO, especially in PPR. That's an easy accept for me."

Riley Cooper is still in the mix but mostly as a blocking specialist. Not sure if Davis makes an impact at all but if he busts it on special teams he'll win Chip over.

DynastyFF,3d6vfy,just_trizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:16:12 2015 UTC,Kenny Bell. Super polished short yardage receiver. He'll likely end up as the slot receiver this year and might begin to overtake VJax (32) as soon as next year.  Should be a great WR2/3 in PPR eventually. Also Vince Mayle is someone I've been paying attention to.
DynastyFF,3d6vfy,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"Paging /u/aussiemac24 for Darren Waller analysis.   I'd also look at Justin Hardy, WR for the Falcons. He's poised to be the slot guy right away."
DynastyFF,3d6vfy,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 15:04:50 2015 UTC,"Ha!   Agreed on Justin Hardy. He's only getting great pub. Plus, Roddy is getting up there, so he might even have the opportunity to move outside long-term.  I'm really high on Waller as a late round/UDFA. He's 6'6 235lbs and runs a 4.4 40!! Plus, he's on a team with all unproven WRs and 1 really old vet. At a minimum, I expect him to be a key redzone target, but could even get WR2 looks and deep threat capability.   If you want to go super deep sleeper, Tre McBride with Tennessee has some real potential if Waller/Hardy are already gone. Smelter has also fallen due to his injury, but his talent and situation are also easy to like."

DynastyFF,3d6vfy,Wetzilla,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"For WRs I like both McBride and Kenny Bell, there's been a bit of buzz on him from OTAs. Vince Mayle is also a nice shot in the dark, someone has to catch passes in Cleveland, why not him?  For RBs I like Buck Allen, Josh Robinson, and Matt Jones, though they aren't going too late, usually in the 3rd round or so. For guys going in the 4th or later I like Mike Davis, Zach Zenner, Thomas Rawls, and Malcolm Brown. Some poeple have already mentioned Rawls, he's getting some good buzz out of Seattle. Davis was pretty good, and I'm not entirely convinced that Hyde has the SF backfield locked down. I think Davis could push him for playing time. Zenner had some negative buzz coming out of OTAs and mini camp, but he's a guy that isn't going to do well without pads. He's great after contact, and I think once training camp comes around there's going to be a bit more buzz around this guy. Brown is kind of a shot in the dark, like Mayle, but in this case you're kind of hoping that he doesn't make the 53 man roster for the Rams, since he'll just be completely buried on the depth chart there. Though if he does get kept that probably says something good about him, that St. Louis decided to keep him even though they didn't really need another RB. He didn't play great last year, but he did very well in 2013, so he's not a terrible stash until we see what happens."
DynastyFF,3d6vfy,Hawxfan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"I grabbed Davis pretty late and I'm pretty happy with it.  If Bush gets injured I can see him getting pretty involved in the passing game and if Hyde goes down he'll see some carries  Also loved zenner and brown before the nfl draft, but their landing spots turned me off a little...rooting for them big time though"
DynastyFF,3d60vs,Fantasy_Phanatic,6,Mon Jul 13 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"The biggest factor that sticks out to me here is what your window of competition is.  The two players are a toss-up for me. I really really like White. Long-term upside is nuts to me, though I agree with those that have hesitations. However, Fox is slow playing that hand like nobody's business, and has a track record of never hesitating to put in a middling veteran in the place of a rookie, even when both are of equal skill levels (see Cody Latimer/Andre Caldwell last year). White is supposedly #4 on the depth chart right now, behind Wilson and Royal, and didn't finish OTAs with an undisclosed injury (Fox kept it mum). I would hope that he wouldn't be so brash as to let anyone but White come out of training camp as the #2, but I wouldn't put it past him. Also I agree that he definitely has the worse QB, and as long as Jeffery remains in Chicago, I have hard time seeing him as being more than the #2 option in that offense (failing an ODB-esque breakout).  Parker was doing some nasty things, though padless, against Brent Grimes in practices already. There's also nobody deliberately ahead of him for the immediate future - nobody on the roster really fits his size and skill set. #1 job is his for when he grows into it. Gut says Jennings was brought in to give some veteran presence to a very young corps, and he won't get in the way of the youngsters getting time. Like you said, he'll get that starting job, and Tannehill keeps developing positively every year. In the immediacy, Parker offers more benefit imo.   So if you're looking to compete sooner rather than later, I'd do Parker over White. If you don't mind sitting on White for a while, you might go the other way."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,bastegod,2,Mon Jul 13 20:49:28 2015 UTC,You touched on another point about Fox's hesitance to play rookies. Ourlads.com have him lining up across from Jeffery with Royal in the slot. I also forgot about his undisclosed injury.   Thanks for the insight.
DynastyFF,3d60vs,bastegod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:11:22 2015 UTC,"For sure. Yeah I was fuming after seeing the blase Marquess Wilson consistently being given snaps ahead of White - not having your #1 pick get busy immediately is just pure hubris imo. Though I'll admit as a Denverite that I'm extra touchy about Fox's ultra-conservative style after watching him squander such incredible weapons for the last few years. Adam Gase was our saving grace, but it still wasn't enough to keep the team from falling asleep all the time.   John Fox = NFL Nyquil"

DynastyFF,3d60vs,Cavemansol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Parker has as much long term value too. He's going to grow WITH Tannehill as opposed to White who's eventually going to have to start from scratch with another QB in chicago, even as early as the 2017 season (if cutler once again disappoints, I dunno about his chances of staying in chicago).  I just see a recipe for failure brewing in Chicago for White. He's a ready a limited route runner, he's only really been great one year and we don't know if he's some capable of repeating that success, and he's likely going to be in a messy situation with Cutler in Chicago.   Give me the stability of Miami (did I just say that?) and the damn near guaranteed reliable Tannehill situation any day of the week."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,macsouthphilly,5,Tue Jul 14 11:54:27 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like White at all and am not that impressed by him. I also think that Parker has better hands. He catches everything that's around him. He got the Calvin-esque catch radius. I'M going Parker, unless I know that I can trade White for a haul. I had the 4th pick in my draft and traded the guy with the 5th pick.  I was going Parker then and still am. Only I received 2.01, 3.01 and 2 2016 4ths for waiting one more pick to do it. I have Parker as my number 3 guy on my board ahead of Gordon.  I'm almost assuredly in the minority though."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,PHV,3,Mon Jul 13 20:31:56 2015 UTC,3rd best player imo as well.  You're not alone.
DynastyFF,3d60vs,wolf_nipple_chips,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:41:42 2015 UTC,I did just trade up from the 1.06 to the 1.04. I considered trading back with the 1.05 but he is somewhat of a wildcase. He could take Parker over white with the 1.04.   I agree with your assessment of Parker though.
DynastyFF,3d60vs,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:07:11 2015 UTC,Right there with you. Parker is criminally underrated.
DynastyFF,3d60vs,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 14 11:56:58 2015 UTC,I'm a Parker fan myself.  Just feel like White's route tree is limited and Cutler isn't great.  Meanwhile Parker reminds me of Allen Robinson and Tannehill is getting better.
DynastyFF,3d60vs,doodwhersmycar,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:15 2015 UTC,"I like Parker better too.  Parker has excellent hands and is a more natural WR than White.  Parker might not be quite the athlete White is, but Parker is an elite athlete as well.  I watched the tape on both of these guys and while White made some truly epic plays, he wasn't able to consistently separate against DB's despite his elite athleticism which is a concern.  His route running was poor in my opinion (average at best) although some people will tell you otherwise.  Considering he only had one good year, with much of that production coming from screen passes and the like, I personally would not consider taking him for his price point.  I'd much rather have Perriman later in the 1st than White early in the 1st.  Parker does have a lot of competition for targets this year but I think within a year he will easily surpass them to be the #1 guy in Miami.  OTA puff pieces are generally useless but you almost always hear glowing reports on players (like you do with Parker) and so you notice when there isn't much about a guy like White impressing at camp which would concern me a little bit as well.  edit:  It's crazy how the tide has shifted back to Parker.  Before the combine and draft, the consensus was Parker was ahead of White.  Then combine/draft happened, and White was ahead of Parker.  I was in the minority suggesting I'd take Parker over White.  Fastforward a few months and now it's Parker>White again."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,doodwhersmycar,2,Mon Jul 13 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"White has better hands? Fun stat: Parker has dropped 3 catchable passes since 2012.  I choose parker, but there is no right or wrong answer."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,deadrabbits76,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:59:09 2015 UTC,"So I'm in the minority here, surprisingly! I feel like you have to go White here, but I don't know that there's a wrong choice. To me, the comparisons are very much like this: Parker = AJG and White = DT. Parker is more polished, runs clean routes, long, and uses his hands very well. White is incredibly raw specimen who isn't asked to run very intricate routes. However, how hard is it for someone of that athleticism to learn a route tree, when that is his job? He shows tremendous speed and footwork, that running routes isn't a concern of mine at all. Additionally, he doesn't shy from contact and uses his hands to catch balls as well. I feel athletes like White are very rare and should be prized. I also think he'll hold up better since he's a bit bulkier.   In all, they're both great prospects, but I'd give the edge to White due to his size and speed combo while also possessing the other key attributes of a successful WR."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,Cavemansol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:48:49 2015 UTC,I appreciate your analysis. What are your thoughts on his bust-potential?
DynastyFF,3d60vs,deadrabbits76,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"There are no guarantees, but I feel like he's as safe as anyone. I don't have any less faith in Cutler than I would in Tannehill or Carr. Additionally, he seems to get it and have a good work ethic. I don't see any red flags for him whatsoever. I honestly think he could keep his college route tree and be successful. Bears have #1 in Jeffery, dual threat RB in Forte, TE in Bennet, so defenses will struggle to really focus on him."
DynastyFF,3d60vs,Cavemansol,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in the minority too, quite surprised myself. White having prototypical size speed and hands does it for me. The whole thing about fox not playing rookies I just don't get why you would not take a player based on that. It blows me away. This. Is. Dynasty. If you need a rookie to come in and contribute right away 1. your team isn't competing and 2. You might as well trade that pick away for a veteran to play if your managing your team with that logic. You take white or any player because you get his entire career of production. Not Bc you think a player has rookie year upside. Nor do you not take a player bc he might not produce year one, esp when his ceiling is sky high (and a lot of draftniks said his ceiling is higher than coopers, though Cooper is the safer player). Sorry for the rant. I'm done now."

We were both pretty happy with that deal as I was looking to push my window out a couple years and he was looking to compete this year.  I think Julio and AB would fetch a similar price in PPR leagues."
DynastyFF,3d5x1d,TMN09,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"What was your budget? I will edit my comments in once I know. EDIT: Okay at 265, I love the Julio Jones/AJ Green/Golden Tate starting lineup. Investing only 97$ in those 3 guys is great In addition both Adams and Moncrief and Landry seem like solid pick ups, although you paid a little more than what I thought you should for Landry and Moncrief. As for QB, I would have rather spent less money on a different QB, even though I like Cam he is not worth Golden Tate + Landry from people on your team(unless this is 2 QB. Also, for RB, The amounts you paid for Freeman and Vereen seem excessive as there is no way those guys are worth more than Adams and about the same as Moncrief. Same issue with the tight ends and defenses. Just too much. Maybe thats the way the draft went, but if that were the case I would have only drafted WRs. Unless this league is big like 14 team, your RBs will hold you down significantly, unless you only have to start one or something. I would be trying to move Cam/Landry/Freeman/Fleener/(maybe Ebron) to improve your team."
DynastyFF,3d5x1d,PaoloPWD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:54:30 2015 UTC,My budget was $260. I have $21 left over just in case I drop someone I will have some space to cover cap hits. Cap hits come out 50% of the remaining contract that can be paid in full at the end of the year or spread out for the duration of the contract that was cut   EDIT: Sorry it was $265 our commish had a typo in the google doc and we just ran with it.
DynastyFF,3d5x1d,sg3751,2,Mon Jul 13 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"Don't know cap or anything like that but what sticks out to me most I think is that you paid a pretty big amount for Ebron. That's cool if you like him a lot, but he'll be really hard to trade (again, I'm assuming this is a large amount for your league's cap). Besides that, your WR situation looks good, and I personally like your situation with Cam as I'm a lot higher on him than most.   edit: looking back on it, you might want to consider offloading one of your WRs if you're given a good offer. The two are elite, but you have almost 1/3 of all your cap tied to them for the next five years. I personally would prefer more flexibility. Great value on Sankey, imo, (half Amendola's cost). And as someone else said, RBs need to be improved, as the rest of your team looks ready to compete in 2 years. Think you did pretty well overall!"
DynastyFF,3d5x1d,ConstableMaynard,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:26 2015 UTC,You need some better rbs. I'd recommend trading a WR to see if you can get tevin Coleman to handcuff Freeman. You really need to make sure you got a solid starter at RB.
DynastyFF,3d5x1d,doodwhersmycar,2,Mon Jul 13 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"You stole Adams. Downright steal. Bortles for good value too. Glad you spent the money on those top end WRs they make your roster instant competitors. I think you overpaid on freeman, I think vereen will be your RB 1 which is a scary thought but I do like him this year. I think you got great value on Sankey. How many of each position do you start? Hope you can start at least 4 wrs. If it's Ppr you got a competing team. Though your RBs aren't great it will help them if it is PPR.   Edit: to add my .02 once more, I personally am fine spending at least a third on elite WRs. In my auction I spent 2/3 of my budget on Watkins OBJ Evans Bryant Adams and Moncreif if that helps"
DynastyFF,3d5x1d,Fantasy_Phanatic,2,Tue Jul 14 00:10:34 2015 UTC,I can start 3 receivers and a flex  so I can start 4 receivers. and its a weird PPR I get 2 points for every 5 catches.

DynastyFF,3d774d,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:10:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, never seen him go that low before. Why is he dropping so hard lately? I remember people put him above Cooper for a while."
DynastyFF,3d774d,macsouthphilly,2,Tue Jul 14 01:52:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know I would've taken him as the 2nd receiver but I won't complain. I'm absolutely loaded with young receivers haha.
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,macsouthphilly,9,Mon Jul 13 21:29:00 2015 UTC,I would be falling over myself to accept this.
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,Sticky_Z,3,Mon Jul 13 21:34:29 2015 UTC,So would you then take Gurley at 1.01?  Thanks for the advice by the way.  I think I'm gonna take it.
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,Sticky_Z,5,Mon Jul 13 21:39:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have a single issue with that. I think I'm still taking Cooper tho but that's personal. You can use 1.10 and 2.03 to take some shots at RB
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,bastegod,2,Mon Jul 13 21:47:51 2015 UTC,"Man that's just a pure upgrade on all fronts.    Robinson (37.5) > Hyde (43.6) in startup, and you swap for a better side car. Close that deal."
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,bastegod,2,Mon Jul 13 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Is that ADP data? And if so, what's the source you're using if you don't mind me asking."
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"Right here sir [link] - just DLF's latest dynasty startup ADP. It's pretty good in a pinch, though it's of course no bible. There are definitely other aggregate lists out there."
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,Vacar,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:14 2015 UTC,Just saw that is ADP from DLF.  Thanks again.
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,peckx063,3,Mon Jul 13 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'd hit ""accept"" so fast on that one, he'd be left wondering what the hell he did wrong. I'd take Cooper regardless. I think your WR corps could really use the boost."
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,gospeedracergooo,3,Mon Jul 13 21:41:57 2015 UTC,Hyde < Robinson  3.01 < 2.03  Yep.

DynastyFF,3d6b7v,PHV,3,Mon Jul 13 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, did anyone watch Hyde play in college? He is the best back in that class, and its a non-PPR... Hyde > Robinson. I'd keep Hyde and grab Cooper with the 1.01 and go WR/RB at 1.10 /2.01 or vice versa."
DynastyFF,3d6b7v,fantasy_boss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that Hyde is underrated in this community.  When I watched him play last year, i saw burst and an ability to always fall forward.  Also, PFF has released some interesting stats about his ability to break tackles and avoid negative plays.  I took the trade, but I don't think it is as big of a win as some people may think.  Appreciate all the comments though!"
DynastyFF,3d6ana,Fantasy_Phanatic,7,Mon Jul 13 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yikes, I think he may have gotten the better of you on this one. It all depends on the IDP scoring though. J.J. Watt is approaching Randall Cobb's value all by himself if it's a big-play scoring league."
DynastyFF,3d6ana,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"Watt was definitely the biggest loss on my part. I will miss him, especially since I just signed him for 3 years at $5 and he got mad points for me last year. Watt got 212 points and Cobb got 275 points. I would have loved to keep him but I have Suh as my backup in the DE+DT slot and I place more importance on a young WR than a DE. Watt also had a historic year last year and while Watt has a better chance than any other IDP to repeat, most don't see that as a possibility."
DynastyFF,3d6ana,cardsfan1343,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:51:48 2015 UTC,How many points did the 12th best DE get in your league last year?
DynastyFF,3d6ana,cardsfan1343,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:47 2015 UTC,Sheldon Richardson got 80 points. Suh got 112
DynastyFF,3d6ana,blardorg,7,Mon Jul 13 23:33:43 2015 UTC,"Well assuming you start 2 WRs and a flex, the baseline for WRs is the #30 WR, and I asked about the 12th best DE because that's the baseline for that position. The #30 WR in your league probably put up about 170 points in your league (correct me if I'm wrong). So the value over the baseline for Cobb was about 105 points, whereas the value over the baseline for Watt was 132. Watt was more valuable than Cobb last year by a fairly significant margin in your league, and there's really no glaring indication that this year or any future year will be much different than last year for either player.  So it comes down to this:  Watt > Cobb  Adams + 1.06 > 1.04  And then you also gave him your 3.06 and 2016 2nd rounder  No offense, but I think you got bamboozled by somebody who understands value-based drafting more than you do."
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Ccm120,9,Mon Jul 13 14:15:23 2015 UTC,Gronk should command more than what your paying by himself...that's a huge win for you.
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Cavemansol,4,Mon Jul 13 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"Gronk side, easy.  Gronk > CJ DGB+2nd > Bennett  w/ Graham's trade, Gronk is potentially more dominant at his position than any other offensive player really.  Also, look at dynasty ADP, and Gronk is currently #2 overall (although that seems high to me), and Megatron is #14 overall."
DynastyFF,3d4myl,ZeroCool79,2,Mon Jul 13 15:23:56 2015 UTC,I'd absolutely do this.
DynastyFF,3d4myl,plap11,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"Take it immediately. Gronk wins this all day long. DGB has HUGE potential, although pretty big bust potential too.  Good deal for you bud."
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:09 2015 UTC,would you do gronk for hopkins and a 1st and 2nd round rookie pick?
DynastyFF,3d4myl,mj62,2,Mon Jul 13 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"No. I'd rather have the Gronk/DGB/2nd deal. I wouldn't give up Hopkins/1st/2nd for Gronk straight up, especially given you're doing OK at TE anyway."
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm not OP so roster construction is different. I have no TE at moment, would probably draft ASJ. Dez and Antonio Brown at wr"
DynastyFF,3d4myl,mj62,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. Are those picks for the current rookie draft or 2016?"
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:38:01 2015 UTC,2016 rookie draft . If I had to guess they'd be 10th and 22nd overall. Rookies can be kept for 3 years with no penalty
DynastyFF,3d4myl,mj62,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"Starting 2WRs I'd take the deal, not knowing your depth...keep in mind Dez's tweet today re sitting out.  Starting 3 WRs, I'd decline and roll with ASJ, who I'm actually pretty high on right now. He's a monster and Winston targeted his TE (who was shitty) more than anyone else in CFB last year."
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"2 rb, 2 wr, 1 flex   My keepers are  Mccoy$75 Randle$6 Dmc$1 Ingram$1 Dez$57 Dt$58 Antonio Brown$11 Hopkins$6  $300 cap, also Starts 3 idp"
DynastyFF,3d4myl,mj62,2,Mon Jul 13 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"In this instance, I'd do the deal for Gronk. However, I'd almost try to offload Dez or DT and flip the picks. For instance, give DT/2nd for Gronk/1st.   That would free up some cap space for this upcoming draft (assuming it hasn't taken place yet), where you could overpay for another RB. You'd be well covered with Dez/AB/Hopkins."
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Therealcodyg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"This is tough. (Changed my mind, I like this trade) I don't know the league setup... but Gronk can command a ridiculous price. Some would say Gronk>CJ, but even if we assume Gronk=CJ, to get DG-B and 2nd for Bennett is awesome! It really depends if you're in win-now or not. Looking at your roster though, I think its the right time to sell Calvin and Lynch, and that's a very fair trade for Calvin. Plus, if L.Green pans out, you could deal Gronk mid-season for a bounty! Bring on the rebuild!!!!"
DynastyFF,3d4myl,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:20 2015 UTC,Easy win in my book  CJ=Gronk  DGB/2nd>Marty B
DynastyFF,3d4myl,auggiedoggies,3,Mon Jul 13 15:18:38 2015 UTC,I think the consensus is pretty much that Gronk > CJ by quite a margin at this point. So I think it's an even bigger win.
DynastyFF,3d4myl,Theczarcasticone,2,Mon Jul 13 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that definitely is the consensus. I think it's a bit overblown, but that's certainly the popular opinion right now"
DynastyFF,3d4myl,auggiedoggies,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:27:23 2015 UTC,It's a good deal for you.

DynastyFF,3d6srt,scott_4,2,Mon Jul 13 23:41:18 2015 UTC,"Your WRs are stacked so I would deal Jeffery for Bell.  If you wanted to get Cooper you would definitely have to use your 1.1 to get him.  You could get Gordon with your 1.3, who is still a very good RB prospect in a good situation.  However, if you really wanted the generational talent that is Gurley, you could try and move up to 1.2 with your 1.3 by packaging some of your later picks."
DynastyFF,3d6srt,swordofthemorning65,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"If i can't move Jeffery before the draft i plan on going Cooper 1.1 (then the team who has bell owns 1.2) and then ill take either Gordon or hopefully Gurley. If i get Bell i have to trade Jeffery due to $$ alone. I just dont want to miss out on Cooper(raiders fan). I have two 2nd rounders next year. Not sure how much i need to give up to get Bell. I sent him this:  Jeffery, B. Sankey, 1.1 for L. Bell, and his 1.2.   I doubt he'll do this, but its a starting point. I think i'll need to give my 2nd next season as well? (you think im too far off?) Also a risky move if he takes Cooper 1.1. But a huge payoff if he doesnt and i still get my two guys. Word is he likes Gordon."
DynastyFF,3d6srt,swordofthemorning65,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:16:24 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if he accepted that Sankey offer, but you're doing the right thing by starting low and not coming in with too much. Just keep gradually adding a little more until he breaks. Everyone has a price and you definitely have the assets to get there. It seems 50/50 as to if Cooper or Gurley goes 1st overall, but since you're a Raiders fan I wouldn't want to risk losing the chance to have Cooper on your team.  It'll make it way more fun plus the obvious longer shelf life that you'll get from Cooper."
DynastyFF,3d6srt,swordofthemorning65,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:25:24 2015 UTC,"True! I think holding tight and using those picks isn't a bad thing either. I'd rather have Cooper and Gurley/Gordon than miss out on Cooper and have Bell, Foster, and Gurley/Gordon. The good thing is that he approached me about the trade, so he wants to move up bad. I can always wait to see who didn't get a WR in the draft and pilfer a RB off their roster while Gurley gets going (if its Gurley at 3). I think i'm in a very good situation right now, whereas he needs help at a couple spots and might get desperate and allow me to get the better deal. Draft is two weeks away so we'll see.   btw, whats your thoughts on Fleener this year? Too many targets in indy? the guy who owns Bell is a Colts fan. Might be able to do something there? (i have Fleener and Ebron, plan on targeting O. Daniels or something stable at that pos. in the draft)"
DynastyFF,3d6pje,OwningTheWorld,3,Mon Jul 13 23:16:03 2015 UTC,"Seems like you are easily getting the better end of this deal to me. You move up from 1.09 to 1.04 and up from the 6th to 5th, just to move back in the 2nd. This means you get one of Odell, Julio, Dez, Evans, and that is very exciting.   Easy accept for a good deal."
DynastyFF,3d6pje,Dr_Lollygag,2,Mon Jul 13 23:20:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for the input!
DynastyFF,3d6pje,sg3751,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:30:28 2015 UTC,I like it for you. Generating a definite increase in value for a (technically) lateral movement is usually good in my book.
DynastyFF,3d6pje,onlymycouchpullsout,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"Easy Accept like was said below. It would probably be more fair if you got the 6th and gave up a 5th. since its not the case you easily win, enjoy Dez/Julio/OBJ/Brown"
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,Futbol5,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"Why do you want Kelce when you have Ertz? Are you willing to give up Ertz?  To be honest, I wouldn't trade for Kelce right now if you don't want to give up Marshawn. Kelce's stock his through the roof. I think you'll end up overpaying if you go for him before the season starts. Other player worth giving up is maybe Adams? I doubt he'll do it for Landry. Plus he will have no TE."
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:23:42 2015 UTC,"I believe Kelce is more established than Ertz, which is why I want to go for him. I'd be willing to offer Ertz as part of a trade so he has a TE, but don't know who to offer with him. Was thinking somewhere along the lines of Ertz + Mason or Allen for Kelce"
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"IMO you should just keep with Ertz. I'd gladly accept Ertz+Allen for Kelce. I think you're giving too much, but if he won't go for that price then I don't think it's worth it."
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,OP85,2,Mon Jul 13 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"Why is your roster 1 pick smaller than his? or are you holding 2 qb's? Either way, Adams seems to hold good value at $3.   Try Adams + Ertz for Kelce + Torrey.  basically your giving him slightly lower players but for a much better value.  edit: I just realized hes way under  budget at 105 with his current roster. this trade may not work, looks like he may be trying to score a big name rather then lower his cap."
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,OP85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"I'm keeping one less player going into our draft, that's all. And that seems fair, I think I'd go for Bryant over smith though personally"
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,OP85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"O, you guys havnt even drafted yet, ok that makes a little more sense but that kind of changes some things. youre pretty high on your budget. Of course bryant is a better player than smith, but theres no way the guy accepts that.   Maybe try K. Allen + Ertz + Landry  vs   Cooks + Kelce  I dont think he will bite, cooks value is way too good at that price. but worth a shot plus that will free up $20 for you."
DynastyFF,3d5rfz,chiefst,2,Mon Jul 13 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"Actually I may have a better offer, since he originally wanted Lynch and he has some decent RB's to pick from.  Lynch + Allen + Ertz  vs  Cooks + Kelce + (choose who ever you like between his RB's, obviously not mccoy though).  I personally like Ingram > Murray > Forsett > Miller at those prices."
DynastyFF,3d5lz3,Therealcodyg,3,Mon Jul 13 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"Why are you holding two team defenses and a kicker? You need to drop those before anyone else, unless there is some rule about keeping certain positions. I'd also easily drop Manziel before Waller, Manuel, or Huff (though that isn't necessary if you can cut those DSTs and kicker). Since you need 6 cuts, I would do:  Panthers DST, Ravens DST, Matt Bryant K, Chris Johnson RB, Ryan Williams RB, Jonas Gray RB  When the season starts, you'll have more info on how your WR fliers (Huff, Richardson, etc) are doing, and will be able to make more informed decisions about who to drop to pick up a DST and K.  If you have to hold one DST and one kicker due to roster requirements or something, I would do:  one of the DSTs, Chris Johnson RB, Ryan Williams RB, Jonas Gray RB, Johnny Manziel QB, EJ Manuel QB  In a 10 team league, guys like Manziel and Manuel should basically never see your starting roster, and should probably be sitting on the wire for when someone's QB1 and QB2 both have freak season ending injuries. With Cam and Flacco, you don't need them at all, and keeping WR fliers like Waller, Huff, and Richardson is a much better strategy."
DynastyFF,3d5lz3,blardorg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"I would hang onto Waller. I think he will see the field this year. I personally hate carrying more than 1 D/ST and stream on the bye, so you could drop that instead. I would also consider cutting Paul Richardson over Josh Huff."
DynastyFF,3d5lz3,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"Funny, I just posted on the Ravens sub asking if anyone has info on Waller's progress. He's got some serious physical skill and was last on my list of cuts. Didn't think anyone would advocate for him here honestly.  I'll definitely consider keeping Huff over Richardson...his knee does bother me a bit.  What do you think about Manziel instead of Waller? Not too worried about carrying Cam/Flacco. JFF could be dead weight."
DynastyFF,3d5lz3,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:58:43 2015 UTC,He's the other guy I was going to mention honestly. I would try trading him for a draft pick though. Someone may give up a 2nd/3rd for him. Any Aggies in your league???   I'm very biased on Waller to be fair. I went to GT and he is a match-up nightmare. 6'6 with 4.4 speed and high points the ball. He has to be at a minimum a real redzone target with Baltimore WR/TE situation.  Sample 1  Sample 2  Sample 3
DynastyFF,3d5lz3,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, I knew something was up. I'm a UGA fan living in Midtown so Waller was always on my radar. I took him with my last pick and everyone gave me the ""who??"" treatment. I'd love to see him blow up.  Doubtful I can swing a deal for JFF, QBs were drastically undervalued. Maybe if I could hang on to him for a few weeks into the season and he blew up, however, cuts before the season make his value dive...but it's probably not a huge loss with my current QB situation. I'd much rather stash Waller/Huff and draft a QB in a few years."
DynastyFF,3d5lz3,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 13 19:22:17 2015 UTC,I agree... I really doubt you'll regret cutting JFF. I do think you could with some of the others.  Sorry for Sample 1 then on your boy Swann :)

DynastyFF,3d5lz3,Paloma_II,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:41 2015 UTC,You wouldn't swap Chris Johnson for Bowe/Richardson? Picked him up hoping he'd sign somewhere but it's not looking good.
DynastyFF,3d5fec,akbfrosty,2,Mon Jul 13 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's too late. For a 14 man ppr, you still have great building blocks. Keep drafting for youth, but with short-term potential. Shady and Gurley are 2 great RBs. I'd focus on building WR depth since RBs have been run through and knowing that you will still be able to get RB depth later. You can always punt post-draft. I think punting during the draft is a bit premature."
DynastyFF,3d5fec,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I should also say I have one more 3rd round pick and then don't pick until the 7th...should I try to trade into the 5th for an extra pick or ride it out? I've never traded this much in a draft before."
DynastyFF,3d5fec,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 13 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"if that's the case, then it sounds like you've already punted haha.   If you think you get a good value trade for it, sure, but I wouldn't force it."

DynastyFF,3d5fec,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 13 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah your hand is kind of forced here. You won't be able to flesh out a starting lineup to win now with missing so many picks, even though your first few players are all very sweet. I'd embrace the 2016 picks and just keep going in that direction. Sounds like you must have gotten good value on those trades to have so many firsts next year!"
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,slibaz,8,Mon Jul 13 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"Most redraft rankings I can find have Agholor above White, so if you're only concerned with immediate production, I'd take Agholor. However, it's worth noting that White is usually within 6-8 spots of Agholor, so the difference isn't big.  If I had a 100% win-now team, this is probably how I would rank the rookies:   Gordon Cooper   These two would be real close and could easily be swapped depending on team need and starting requirements.   Gurley   I know he's probably going to miss a few games, but he's too good to let fall any further, even for a team that isn't concerned with the future. Unless Mason plays himself into a timeshare, Gurley could definitely outscore Gordon once he comes back.    Agholor Perriman   As we saw with Kelvin Benjamin last season, opportunity can trump talent. Kevin White is probably the better talent than both of these guys, but the opportunity they have makes them prime targets for win-now teams.   Yeldon   Other than Gordon, he has the clearest path to playing time for a rookie RB.   White Abdullah   Both of these guys are probably going to play second fiddle to somebody else this season, but have the talent to carve out a significant enough role to make them fantasy relevant."
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,m_plis,3,Mon Jul 13 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's Gordon #1 then Agholor #2 (With Cooper off the board). Trade back to grab to the 1.05/1.06 range to grab Agholor if you want to be safe. That way you get your guy + something. But Chip was really impressed with Agholor as a true freshman when he tore the ducks up for 6-162-1, I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up 1,000 yards 6-8 TDs."
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,gospeedracergooo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"In terms of ""win-now"", i'd rank the guys you mentioned as:   Gordon Agholor White"

I love him, but the guy is currently recovering from another foot surgery and we don't have a sure timetable yet for his return, and he has decent depth around him at his position on the team. If anything, I think he's the least likely to contribute to a win-now approach. I'll probably be looking to buy after the season if his stock goes down enough though."
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,Theczarcasticone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"That's very true. They talk about it as if it's not a major procedure, but you never know. There is a lot of talk that Dolphins want to work Parker immediately where as Chicago currently has White as WR4. It's probably all preseason fodder, but I figured Parker's name belonged in the list as well"

DynastyFF,3d4ssq,ZeroCool79,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:43:50 2015 UTC,I agree on Agholor. You're other option is to try to trade down to 1.08+ with the hopes of still getting Agholor plus the likes of DGB/Abdullah/D.Johonson(s) if you can get a 2nd 1st round pick.
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"I personally have Gordon 6th in my rankings (after Gurley, White, Cooper, Agholor, and Parker). In terms of immediate impact, I think that Gordon is more likely to have something usable (who else is getting those rushes?), but Agholor is more likely to have something great. Gordon will undoubtedly be held under 3 YPC (like he was against Western Illinois and Ohio State last year) in some games this year. He's very good when he gets into space, but he won't have as big of holes to run through in the NFL."
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,umaro900,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"For me, the ""win now"" rookies are Gurley, Agholor, Cooper, and Gordon (by default).   Assuming Gurley, Cooper and either Gordon/White are gone when you pick, and based on your current team, I'd take Agholor. He's set to be a PPR stud off the bat. Huff doesn't pose a threat and Matthews will be likely operating out of the slot, leaving Agholor outside.  That being said, if Gurley or Cooper somehow fall by some miracle, obviously take either of them."
DynastyFF,3d4ssq,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Gordon, Gurley, agholor are my favorites. I don't like white or Cooper nearly as much as everyone else seems to. Cooper if I had to choose one of em though."

DynastyFF,3d4c9x,the_real_Alex14,5,Mon Jul 13 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"Gurley is the best player in this trade, and this guy is not even coming close to what I'd trade for him. Honestly, there aren't many players on his team I'd take for Gurley at the moment. If he lives up to potential, you're 1 RB away (maybe Randle if all goes well) from really making some waves next year. Worst case scenario, plan to grab a RB to lock up your starters and/or a WR to replace Roddy and you're golden.  If it were my team I'd hold pat, let Randle's situation play out...if he has a few big weeks behind that line, ship him off for a young WR/draft pick to someone in need this year. That will help jump start your replacing Roddy issue and roll with Foster/Gurley this year. Use everything you got to move up next year and take an elite player.  Full disclosure, I'm ridiculously high on Gurley, I honestly think he's going to be a superstar in the league for years. I essentially traded Benjamin/Lamar Miller to acquire rights to Gurley (Mason and later round picks thrown in) during the rookie draft."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,Therealcodyg,2,Mon Jul 13 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"I really think this is a deal that if you make, will haunt you for a long time.  I think Gurley is a generational talent. Like others have pointed out, I think Murray's hype right now has led many to overvalue him.  Oakland pursued other runningbacks this offseason.  Funchess could turn out nice but I struggle to see him as a top 25 WR."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,Ballislife89,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"This really depends on how you value Latavius Murray and Funchess. Personally, I'd rather have Randle (which you already have) than Murray, but you can decide how you like that. Your trade partner is HURTING for RBs. If you do like Murray, I'd make him upgrade Funchess to Agholor (Eagles O is big play potential) and probably throw in another pick, maybe 2nd. I would make sure this is not a trade you would regret. As much love as Jeremy Hill is getting, Gurley will likely get more than that this time next year."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:50:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'd probably halt all negotiations with you if you countered a fair offer value-wise with what translates to 3 1sts and a 2nd for Gurley and then probably not offer you anything again for fear of you wanting to gouge me on another trade.

DynastyFF,3d4c9x,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is I don't view Latavius Murray as a 1st. And I do view Gurley as a 1.02 at worst. I agree my revised asking price is very high, but that's because I think dealing Gurley will likely be regrettable"
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, you gotta go for who you like and if you're high on someone it's tough to sell them at market rate. Most people probably place Murray around 1.08-1.12 or so I'd imagine. Some maybe quite a bit higher actually."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what makes trades work really. Obviously, Murray could keep doing this. I get the hype behind him, I just don't have faith in his health, his O-Line, or that he gets the 3-down back opportunity."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's a serious error to view Latavious Murray as a 1.xx at all. He's shown you virtually nothing, on a bad team. Gurley has incredibly high potential, which we've seen on a regular basis against great competition in the SEC."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,Therealcodyg,2,Mon Jul 13 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"He's still shown more in the NFL than any rookie and he's the current 3down back with very very good measurables, the dude is super athletic, so I don't see your reasoning behind valuing him under guys like Yeldon, Abdullah, Coleman, etc... who are all going in the late 1st which is where I put him. Not to mention that offseason reports have been very good on him.  I get why you're not high on him, I won't touch Yeldon for the same reasons, but your reasoning behind not valuing him at a 1st is flawed imo."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Murray has more potential than someone like Yeldon, who has no competition currently, but that's my opinion.  I value guys differently based on the type of draft. If this were a startup, Murray isn't close to sniffing a 1st round grade, and neither are any of the guys in this convo.   In rookie only, I'd trade Murray for rights to draft Gurley in a heartbeat. Probably Yeldon too at this point.   Oakland is not a good situation and they've seen Murray for a year, still, only gave him a shot at the very end of the season. Then brought people in to compete...also tried to get someone to come take over completely (D. Murray).  We just have different views on Latavious, which is cool. I see the hype train in full-force with this guy based on a few runs. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd rather take my chances with Gurley."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"I get it and I'm really not that high on him myself, but I still think he's worth a late 1st. I'd rather have him than Yeldon or someone like Dorsett who's been going 1.12-2.0x recently but I'd take Abdullah over him in PPR and possibly Coleman. I'd have to think about it though. ADP-wise I think his value is exactly where it should be: a late 5th - 6th round RB2 ticket with RB1 breakout upside, which is what he is."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sold on Murray being a 3 down back and having a huge impact behind that terrible O-Line. I understand the intrigue, but I'm just not a buyer. I will state my bias upfront though, haha!"
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, I think he was actually right with his comment. His reference to the Eagles was re Agholor.   In my opinion, he's right, Murry/Funchess < Gurley/1st Round next year. Gurley has some incredible potential and will be the back in St. Louis/LA with Mason being the handcuff or shipped off eventually. Murray was great when we saw him...but that was extremely limited on a bad team that will be behind a LOT.   I'd ask for the moon in this trade bc I wouldn't be mad if he rejected it...something like Hill/Funchess/1st for Gurley/2nd. That is a crazy offer, but again, I'd be happy with a rejection."
DynastyFF,3d4c9x,Therealcodyg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:13:31 2015 UTC,"Oakland hasn't showed much confidence in Latavius Murray being their guy, with the signing of Trent Richardson, Helu and trying to pick up Demarco Murray in the offseason. His perceived value is much higher than it should be right now due to that KC game where he broke a 90 yd TD run last year that mostly due to a boneheaded move by KC.  Latavius Murray and Funchess are more investment picks than 'make your team better right now picks,' IMO. They both have a chance to make an impact this year, but are not guys I'd look to make an immediate impact on my team with.   You should be able to get more for Gurley, especially in standard."

I see Agholor as the best dynasty WR prospect outside of Cooper. In a pass-happy system and a versatile WR who can play inside, outside and return kicks/punts.   Kevin White dropped to #5 due to the other targets in Chicago and potential instability at QB in the near future —  Cutler's days in Chicago are numbered.  Perriman is #3 because of being handed a starting job with a stable QB. H-W-S guy that could be a beast if he pans out.  DGB is the definition of boom or bust. The rookie QB knocks him down a bit, but is worth the risk IMO."
DynastyFF,3d4bjd,the_real_Alex14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:31:42 2015 UTC,"I think one flaw in your rankings is that you're focusing a little too much about the situation that these guys landed in rather than their talent. Obviously it's something you have to look at, but when you're drafting rookies you want to focus more so on talent. For example, take Kevin White. While he may not be walking into the most ideal situation, granted, but he has the talent to possibly become the next Julio Jones if he develops properly (which is not absurd to imagine since he'll be under the tutelage of a really good OC in Adam Gase). Another guy like that is Phillip Dorsett. Sure he'll probably be on the field sparingly in his first season, but TY is only under contract for another year. If he walks (which, judging from the fact they made the pick, looks like Indy's plan) Dorsett is going to most likely be a number one receiver in an offense lead by Andrew Luck.  Not to mention that situations can change pretty quickly. Just look at Tre Mason and what happened to that guy. All in all, my point is that when looking at different players to draft as rookies, their situation shouldn't be the ultimate deciding factor for where they get ranked. Just my two bits though."
DynastyFF,3d4bjd,gospeedracergooo,2,Mon Jul 13 12:47:43 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback.   Overall, in the rankings I tried to have a mix of talent, situation and potential future outlook. How would you rank these guys?"
DynastyFF,3d4bjd,Swisscheese1021,2,Mon Jul 13 12:58:16 2015 UTC,"It would probably look something like this:   Cooper White Perriman Agholor Parker Dorsett DGB Strong Funchess   That's based more on the small amount of tape I've watched on them, as well as their situations. When I say situations, I'll compare Agholor and Perriman to Parker. Agholor and Perriman are both not only in situations where they can thrive right now, but they're also in systems that should be able to help them grow as players. Agholor will be learning from a Philly staff headed by arguably the most brilliant offensive mind in football right now. As far as Perriman goes, I trust just about any decision that Ozzie Newsome makes in Baltimore. Guy is a fucking genius when it comes to player evaluation. Also Perriman is going to be surrounded by veterans who are going to be able to help make sure that his work ethic is where it needs to be for a pro athlete.  As for Parker, his situation is a little different because he's surrounded by a lot of other young and promising receivers who have a strong possibility to take targets away from him for a number of years. Don't get me wrong, I still like the guy and think he's a fantastic player, but I think his situation is enough to knock him down past the guys who are talented and in really good positions to help them develop down the road."

I once took over a heavy rebuild project fully ready for the commitment, and my first three trades were vetoed despite being completely reasonable. One was a random mid level trade like Jonathan Stewart for an ok WR. I dropped the league after that. Point is, without trading you can't acquire the necessary youth or sell off the necessary older players. The team isn't good enough to win now and it isn't very close either. I would suggest rebuilding if possible. However if your trades continue to be ignored throughout the next couple weeks, I would honestly drop the league if I were you."

This is definitely on a tangent but I'm setting up a league that's almost identical to the one you posted here in terms of settings and scoring; only difference is a Superflex which I highly recommend. I love these types of leagues but I've always struggled to find an active one so I decided to make my own. Anyway it's $40 per season and run on FleaFlicker and it would be great to get a collection of dedicated owners together for a league that actually lasts.

Without seeing what's being offered and what's being declined, you can't really suggest he drop the league.  Of course if the league really ends up being that bad, then it should be considered (done right, of course. just abandoning it isn't how to go about that)."
DynastyFF,3d3r4m,udeuce,2,Mon Jul 13 08:31:18 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have much in the way of assets that's for sure. I'll take OP's word on it that his trades have been at least reasonable. Considering his league mates are declining trades and giving zero response or counter offer, that doesn't sound like much of a league to me. If he's on a site like FleaFlicker and just hopped into a free league looking to rebuild then I don't take much of an issue with him dropping out (after a couple weeks) if he's continually stonewalled by all of the other owners. Now if it were a paid league or active league I would take issue with it.  His team can't produce any blockbuster rebuild trades but he has about 2-3 solid older players at every position that I think would allow him to stockpile some not-entirely-worthless rookie picks for next year."

If you can't find worthy trade partners, I'm afraid to say you'll need to build this one through the draft. It's going to be a long process.  Try buying 2014 rookies that started slow. ASJ, Moncrief, Adams, even guys like Marqise Lee. Guys like Quick or Janis or Bailey. Then by midseason when some of the 2015 rookies are struggling or not performing yet, try again to pry them away for a ""win now"" asset like Decker or Olsen or Boldin, provided they're actually producing themselves.

If I can't benefit from guys like Lynch, Gates, or anyone else who won't be playing more than 2-3 years, by either getting some capital or riding them thil the wheels fall off, this team is dead in the water for a long time."

Would be an upgrade at 3 spots plus swapping DT for Decker in his lineup.  tried Romo + plus a TE and left it open for anything else for Nelson Agholor and Duke Johnson to the team starting Jaemis Winston.  Offered Lynch up for discussion to the guy with the worst RB group in the league to maybe get Jordan Matthews. granted I dont think he is winning anything any time soon.  Decker+Delayne Walker for Golden Tate to the team with the worst TE's.  Then small stuff like Dwayne Allen for Stevie Johnson.   Baldwin for Isaiah Crowell on a team that would start Baldwin while I'm playing the ""who the fuck is starting in Cleveland game""  Pretty much anything I offer is even on the projection charts or towards them just for this season. I'm not trying to fleece myself on the first offer, but there is no back and forth either."
DynastyFF,3d3r4m,ButSeri0usly,3,Mon Jul 13 09:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well that's your problem then! Thanks. Easy to fix. Only two of those these are even remotely close enough to start a trade discussion if I were your trade partner.  Going to go with DLF mock draft number for reference throughout from here   Lynch + Big Ben + Decker + Gates to the most ""win now"" team in the league for Tannehill and Demarius Thomas   Lynch's ADP is 35. Decker is 88, Roethlisberger is 101, and Gates is 170. Demaryius is 9 and Tannehill is 76. Drop Tannehill from the trade entirely and it still probably doesn't get done. Decker isn't drafted until the 11th round in redraft leagues, and he's 28!   tried Romo + plus a TE and left it open for anything else for Nelson Agholor and Duke Johnson to the team starting Jaemis Winston.   Again not even close unless that TE is something like Jimmy Graham (23)! Not kidding either. Agholor (42) and Johnson (83) are both worth desirable than Romo (140) alone, especially since he already has a serviceable QB prospect in Winston.   Lynch for Matthews   Personally I wouldn't consider this one, but it's close enough to start a discussion for most people. But if he's not even close to competing, that's not going to happen...   Decker and Walker for Tate   Again I think you're shooting way too high. Someone like Decker is going to be impossible to trade for something better. He's 28 years old and has mediocre immediate value too, so you're going to have a hard time finding a trade partner willing to give you good value. If you do trade him, it would have to be for something like a 2nd round pick or a 3rd round pick and a low-value prospect. Or you'll need someone to be desperate mid-season. Honestly, literally no one should be going out to acquire a guy like Eric Decker right now unless he's sold at a discount.   Then small stuff like Dwayne Allen for Stevie Johnson.    This one is definitely reasonable. Surprised you didn't get at least a counter offer for this one, unless he just doesn't want Allen, since value-wise he'd win pretty handily.   Baldwin for Isaiah Crowell on a team that would start Baldwin while I'm playing the ""who the fuck is starting in Cleveland game""   Another one that would get a decline without counter from me. These two are nowhere near on the same level. I'm doing a 12-team PPR startup draft right now where Crowell went in the 6th round a few days ago. It's the 18th round and Baldwin is still undrafted.  If you're going to rebuild this one, IMO you need to be selling players like Decker for whatever you can get, not trying to package them up into bigger, better pieces. (for examples) Lynch for {Funchess|Strong|Charles Johnson|etc} and a first round pick. Decker for a third round pick. Allen for {Conley|Smelter|Lockett|etc} and a third round pick. Roethlisberger and Allen for Duke Johnson. And so on. Trading laterally from older to younger, or trading down by selling one player for multiple unproven, cheaper players."
DynastyFF,3d378v,XanderMatrix,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"Gurley's knee checked out at the draft. I think if the Rams really needed him they would consider playing him week 1. But because they have Mason they are letting him recover for longer.  Also, Gurley is supposedly a once in a generation talent so people are drafting him for his upside. His ceiling is as high as could be. Smelter doesn't possess that same upside (according to scouts) so it's not worth taking an early risk on him.  People probably let Smelter fall too far also. But it makes sense because in today's game, we want rookies to produce from day 1."
DynastyFF,3d378v,Santidreet,2,Mon Jul 13 04:24:14 2015 UTC,"Yes I suppose that's true but with Niners recent history with Lattimore I would doubt they select Smelter in round 4 without knowing in advance that his ACL tear isn't anything but routine. I guess I just wish people would say they don't like Smelter because of his ability and situation, not because of his ACL!"
DynastyFF,3d378v,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd probably put Smelter near the end of the 2nd round on my own board, so the fact that he's falling into the 3rd or 4th (or later! I've snagged him in the 5th in IDP leagues) is criminal to me. But part of the problem too is that Smelter played in a very run-heavy offense, so even though it has produced guys like Megatron and Demaryius, he wasn't able to showcase his talent to the same extent that Gurley did.  That said, I own a Smelter share in literally all but one league right now (6/7 overall)."
DynastyFF,3d378v,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:44:29 2015 UTC,"I took him at 3.05 and felt he was a steal there compared to what was available. I will be perfectly fine if he doesn't pan out, but if he does he could easily be a WR2 most weeks. It just seems odd to me that no one is concerned whatsoever about Gurley's knee, but people are hesitant to take Smelter given the perceived risk."
DynastyFF,3d378v,MrCarlosDanger,2,Mon Jul 13 05:51:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot are concerned for his knee. Otherwise he'd be the consensus 1.01 instead of a split 1.01/1.02. Plus I've seen it argued for Gordon over him! That simply would never happen (even though I still think it's crazy today) if he were healthy from the start."
DynastyFF,3d378v,umaro900,2,Mon Jul 13 06:02:45 2015 UTC,"Biggest reason for his stock dropping for me was simply because he was a WR drafted in the 4th round to a historically run heavy team that isn't known for developing WR's.  Not specifically because of an ACL.  Imagine for a minute if neither one of those player had torn their ACL.  Gurley would have still be a early 1st round pick and Smelter would have maybe moved up to day 2 in the NFL draft?  That's a huge difference if everything went right.  In terms of talent and opportunity there is just a gap between the two players, over the short and the long term.  There is also the fact that all ACL injuries are not created the same.  If there is any additional damage to the surrounding tissues, strains to the MCL, PCL or any other ligaments that weren't initially reported.  Bottom line is the NFL has a team doctor examine all these guys and something about it made his stock fade a bit.  No matter what happens in that regard, people who know more than me and have more intimate knowledge of the situation made that determination.  Not only that, 32 separate organizations of people made that determination.  This is something that I've just noticed in a funny way, you don't often hear Gurley's ACL mentioned in the news without someone also mentioning Dr. James Andrews.  Dr. James Andrews is widely regarded as among the best orthopedic and especially sports medicine doctors in the world.  He was the one who performed the surgery and has been giving updates ever since, none of which have said anything beyond that he will come back to form."
DynastyFF,3d32bt,FluckyU,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"Around 15-20 for me. Panthers don't typically throw a ton. Their gameplan is defense and establishing the run. Funchess could be a great talent, but I'd rather agholor who is speedy in a high caliber offense. That said,  I feel like he will be an all or nothing talent. I feel he will either surpass Benjamin or be a bust. I just don't see him being a wr2 for some reason."
DynastyFF,3d32bt,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"I almost think his ceiling is WR2. He isn't a burner, and he'll most likely be competing with Kelvin for targets for the next 3/4 years at least. Add in that Cam is not a particularly accurate passer and they are not an air-it-out team...  Full disclosure, I took Funchess at 2.02"
DynastyFF,3d32bt,XanderMatrix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:03:05 2015 UTC,"I agree... I think it just comes down to will he be a top redzone target across the NFL. Like you, I don't know that I see it between the other weapons and the Carolina offense."
DynastyFF,3d32bt,aussiemac24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:52:33 2015 UTC,Could turn into an old school receiver like Anquan Boldin or could be a bust. He's a great red zone target but there are reports that he's dropping a lot of passes.
DynastyFF,3d32bt,Santidreet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:19:28 2015 UTC,"He was on my ""do not draft"" list a couple months ago, but I've warmed to him a lot. Mostly because after the second tier of WRs (Perriman, Agholor, Parker, DGB), the drop off to the next tier seems pretty steep. Also, the more I hear of Kelvin Benjamin slacking off or gaining weight (or whatever the new criticism of the week is), the more I think it opens the door for Funchess.  But I'm not thrilled with the talent itself. It's a lot like Benjamin himself was last year, and I could see Funchess having a very similar rookie campaign. Probably tempered significantly since Benjamin blew his expectations out of the water, but still a solid year 1 play.  I've taken him as early as 2.01."

I'm sure there's the ability to have a multi-platform lineup submitter out there as MFL Platinum already works like that.

Very strong at WR. I'd try to trade ARob for a good RB while the ridiculous hype is still a thing."
DynastyFF,3d25lc,csmartin85,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'll have to see if there are any buyers.  About half my league still seemed to be in the redraft mindset, so I had a lot of breakout candidates fall to me later than I expected."
DynastyFF,3d25lc,bastegod,3,Sun Jul 12 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"My instincts tell me to fear McCoy in general as an asset. The O-line is improving in Buffalo, but it's not the Eagles, and Buffalo most likely won't have a QB situation in place for at least another year. D-Lines in that division are stacked (Jets x2, Miami x2, Pats x2), and there's no real vertical threat to keep them from staying tight in the box. McCoy may already be on the dark side of 30 before everything comes together in Buffalo.  Also with the Kromer getting arrested right between OTA/minicamp and training camp, that disruption in leadership might send the line right to pot before the season even starts.  Like CS said, if Shady looks good in preseason, you might try to package him up with Robinson for a top-tier RB investment. Your WRs can handle the loss."
DynastyFF,3d25lc,bastegod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea, thanks.  McCoy was not someone I was high on at all going in, but he was by far the best asset available at that point in the draft.  What RBs do you value that highly?"
DynastyFF,3d25lc,bastegod,2,Sun Jul 12 23:52:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly the only two that pop into mind for that price would be Bell or Lacy - though I'd expect their owners to not want to part ways with them without a little bit more compensation, depending on how they feel about Robinson.   Also I'm a fan of CJ Anderson - QB's may change, but Kubiak's ZBS is forever - though coupling Robinson for that trade would probably be a big overpay."
DynastyFF,3d25lc,Santidreet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the guy who drafted CJ believed in him enough to use his first round pick on the guy (admittedly with 20 keepers going in, but still).  So I'll see what it would take to pry him away, but I'm not especially hopeful on any of those three"
DynastyFF,3d25lc,Santidreet,2,Mon Jul 13 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"Roger that. Sounds like he definitely bit hard. For now, time is on your side. With any luck, pre-season will shift some tides in your favor."

Working to upgrade my rb.  No one wants to trade theirs and are asking for an extreme amount for them. So that's a slow process

DynastyFF,3d2vhg,gospeedracergooo,3,Mon Jul 13 02:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position as you are - Luck owner who is stacked with young receivers. The reason Luck is so valuable and, in my opinion, is a must-hold is because of several factors: First, he's an absolute beast (no-brainer). Second, he's in a good position in Indy. Third, he has close to a decade more of fantasy production - meaning you will likely have to worry more about your league dissolving before having to find another starting QB (barring injuries, etc.). Fourth, players that have the traits I just listed are very rare. Quarterbacks that have those traits are even rarer. In other word, players like Luck only surface every few years (sure-shots who are NOT injury prone and are major fantasy and RL producers). Outside of a large handful of first round rookie picks, there are very few trades I'd make. Your only upgrades would be at RB and I just could not personally justify trading away Luck for, let's say, even Le'Veon.   Just my two cents. I'm sure there is someone who may have a valid counter-argument."
DynastyFF,3d2vhg,dhgodo,2,Mon Jul 13 20:20:07 2015 UTC,in dynasty you have one of the best and relatively youngest qbs and come some unforeseen injury the only time you dont want him starting in your roster is on bye--but even then he might score points.  that's an exaggeration. but with Luck you have one of the safest qbs.  if you want to trade him i'd try to get another starting rb +a future first...and maybe another pick.  you could trade tanny for an rb or maybe tanny and ebron for an rb.  but eh that's just me.
DynastyFF,3d2vhg,edotvee,2,Mon Jul 13 02:31:48 2015 UTC,Smart to Trade Luck.
DynastyFF,3d2vhg,Santidreet,2,Mon Jul 13 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Unless it's for a top tier asset or an absolute haul of picks I wouldn't.  You're pretty well stacked at WR, RB is a little bit of a mess and TE is all young upside players.  Beyond something like a Lacy or Bell or Gronk there aren't many players that I would trade him for straight up based on your roster construction.    Of course that all goes out the window if you're doing some serious wheeling and dealing right now across the board.  In a startup, depending on your scoring he's probably anywhere from late 1st to mid 2nd."
DynastyFF,3d2vhg,MrCarlosDanger,2,Mon Jul 13 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"You're crazy.  He's already a top 6 or so real life qb, a top 2 fantasy qb, and he's young.  He's good enough to have a late first/early second value from a season to season vbd standpoint, should have that for the next decade, and is going to have 2-3 years where he absolutely goes off and breaks some records while winning you the league.  He's as close to a sure thing in fantasy for the next decade plus as you're going to get, and you won't have to worry about a qb for the next decade opening up your drafts to focus more on wrs and rbs."

DynastyFF,3d2vhg,Ez13zie,3,Tue Jul 14 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the general infatuation with Luck, beyond that he's the QB1. Which might be a strange thing to say, since he's obviously very valuable. The thing is, in a 12-team league, there are just so. many. good. QBs that are all worthy of being on a championship roster. There are so many committee QBs you could use to take a team to a championship.  If someone wanted to pay me ""market value"" for Andrew Luck, I'd be all over that shit, long before I'd accept a market value offer for Tannehill or Carr, both of whom are very strong dynasty assets."

DynastyFF,3d2vhg,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 13 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed entirely. People at the FBG forums were talking about Luck being a no brainer 1.01 dynasty start up pick...in a 1 QB league. Boggles my mind. Unless you can start 2 QBs or passing TDs are 6 pt or QB scoring is otherwise inflated, Luck just isn't worth the opportunity cost of passing on top tier WRs, Gronk, and Bell."

Well nothing has changed since then in terms of how he plays football. The guy is a project WR. It probably took most people 5 minutes of tape to see that. But he has incredible pure athleticism and very little experience at the position compared to other guys. Give him a couple years to work on his game and I believe he has a legitimate top 10 ceiling.  I also had to add this in - he is legitimately elite on the back shoulder comeback, a great throw to specialize in. I think it's entirely because he was a basketball player up until going to college. You can see the fast cut and body placement have transferred over on that particular play."

It's truly incredible). Plus Stewart has only exceeded 200 carries once in his seven-year career and only eclipsed 10 games once in the past 3 years. Carolina likes to run the ball, and why not when you have Cam (the other one) as the keeper option on the read option At this point, RBs remaining have young, healthy, and reliable competition in front of them. By week 4, Payne might have the backfield all to himself and doing big things in the read option offense. I see very real Alfred Morris potential from him this year.

DynastyFF,3d0btg,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:02:44 2015 UTC,"That's from the Falcons own website though. Pretty much every team's writers have glowing things to say about almost everybody, especially before the pads go on.  Highly recommend checking out Matt Waldman's RSP where he goes into a lot of depth about Coleman's strengths, weaknesses, and why he thinks Freeman is a much better fit for that system (which in theory should support a strong RB, if not a fantasy RB1)."
DynastyFF,3d0btg,just_trizzy,2,Mon Jul 13 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that team beat reporters hype up the new guys. I was mostly drawing attention to the fact that he might be a good fit for the offense because the Falcons run a similar system to the one he studied in college where he had a great deal of success so it seems to follow if the systems are similar he's got a high chance of being a good fit if he's got the talent.

DynastyFF,3d0btg,umaro900,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"I have such mixed feelings on Abdullah. It looks to me like he'll have some good opportunity, and every source I can find seems to be talking him up like there is something I'm missing on him. I love his smarts, agility, and versatility. However, when it comes down to picking him, I'm really turned off by an apparent lack of size, strength, and speed.   Ideally he would turn into a (prime) Ray Rice, but I'm not convinced he won't be a slightly taller Jacquizz Rodgers."
DynastyFF,3d0btg,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah Ray Rice seems like the best case scenario for him, and that's not a bad best case scenario. I've never been scared away by smaller RBs though.  Zenner is another one of my mid-late round targets for this very reason though. As much as I liked Joique Bell in redraft last season, I don't think he's going to be their long-term or short-term answer, and he's already a lot older than most people would guess."
DynastyFF,3d0btg,umaro900,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"See, I think there's a big difference between short and small. Like Andre Ellington, MJD, and Ray Rice are no taller than Abdullah, but they're all over 200 pounds (closer to 210), and I look at the tape I see them run through contact, not just glance off it and go around it. Abdullah is 190, and although I can certainly believe he can bulk up, he would have to show that both in the gym and on the field.   Zenner I really like (and more at his current price than Abdullah), but I'm not hearing anything about him getting opportunities. Since he's a UDFA, there's a decent chance he might just stay buried in a depth chart. I also think that his balance is a bit worse, and that can be an obstacle which keeps him from being a star in the NFL."
DynastyFF,3d0btg,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, everything here is spot on. Something that give me a little more confidence about Abdullah is that he shouldered a huge workload at Nebraska. Nearly 800 carries in his final 3 seasons, which is far more than Ellington and MJD logged in college themselves. Not quite indicative of whether he can shoulder a similar workload in the NFL, but I think it's a lot more likely than not - especially since there are enough RBs on that roster to split carries.  He's also not expected to be the guy right away, which gives him a little bit extra time to bulk up, ease in, and stay fresh. We'll see about this one. The price is right for me though, especially in PPR, even if he starts off (or maxes out) as a change-of-pace guy."
DynastyFF,3d0btg,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:29:58 2015 UTC,I think goal line touches are the one thing you are most definitely not going to see out of him.
DynastyFF,3d11pj,detphi1,6,Sun Jul 12 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"Plug those settings into fftoday.com and see what point differential Watt has over other DLs. Keep in mind his scoring will likely dip a little this year, as he'll probably regress to high teens sacks and not score as many TDs. But if his point per game differential is still 5+ or so, he absolutely deserves to be a first round pick.   If your league is new to IDP, you might be able to get him later, though, which us important to keep in mind. If everyone else in the league buys into the ""wait on IDPs and especially DLs"", you might be able to maximize your value by taking him in the 2nd or 3rd or even later. Just based on positional advantage, though, he should probably be a 1st round pick in your league."
DynastyFF,3d11pj,blardorg,3,Sun Jul 12 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"With that scoring I'd look to take him in the top of the second round. I'd rather have the stud WRs, Gronkowski, Bell, and maybe the second tier of WRs (Watkins, Hopkins, Cobb, et al)."

DynastyFF,3d0dtl,eaglesf4n86,3,Sun Jul 12 13:01:31 2015 UTC,Need the scoring. But I'm imagining Watt is going to be 1.01.  For example with my scoring JJ Watt had 298.4 points. Good enough for 7th overal player. The 2nd D-linemen for our scoring was Jason Pierre Paul with 170.5(58th overall). The difference is insane. He outscored Demarco Murray. It was like having an RB1 in your DL spot.   As for other IDPs I'd say maybe only Lavante David should be considered round 1. Possibely Keuchly.  It really just depends on if your IDP scoring is big play favored or tack favored. Hard to give advice other wise.
DynastyFF,3d0dtl,DontEatTheCandle,2,Sun Jul 12 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, we need your IDP scoring, but Watt is very likely worth 1.01 unless IDP scoring is very low. In most settings, he'll give you a 5+ point per game advantage over DL#2, which is better than Gronk or Luck/Rodgers. If IDP scoring is decent, Kuechly and David are probably worth an early to mid 1st. They might give a 2-4 ppg advantage and are quite consistent, and be much safer compared to rookies that have a high bust potential.   If IDP scoring is particularly high, guys like Robert Quinn, JPP, the 2nd tier of LBs after Kuechly/David, and even Harrison Smith could all be worth 1st round picks. You're basically just looking for top IDP guys that in your scoring settings give you a decent positional advantage. Almost none of them have the riskiness associated with rookies, which means if someone like Harrison Smith gives you a 2 ppg advantage over DB#2, he is probably worth more than most typical 1st round rookies."

DynastyFF,3d0dtl,fropek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:57:02 2015 UTC,I updated my post to show my league scoring. Thanks for your help.
DynastyFF,3d0dtl,one_in_the_mind,2,Mon Jul 13 11:53:07 2015 UTC,What's the scoring?
DynastyFF,3d0dtl,one_in_the_mind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:22:14 2015 UTC,Scoring added to OP. Thanks.
DynastyFF,3d0dtl,umaro900,2,Mon Jul 13 11:57:20 2015 UTC,"First, tier off your IDPs based upon your scoring. Usually DE/DL is like JJ Watt in Tier 1, and 2 or 3 way down in Tier 2. LBs and DBs usually have a bunch of large tiers which don't differ all that much.  If your scoring shakes out like that, then I'd put Watt around the 1.01 and then all the 2015 offensive rookies between Gurley and Coleman (1.01-1.09 ish) before I'd take an IDP.   Again, it all depends on the scoring, but the tiers tend to be much larger and consistent in IDP, so it really devalues them."
DynastyFF,3d00vo,HighMakkaMakka,2,Sun Jul 12 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"Imo you should trade back. Someone is going to want to secure their guy. I think 6 is my limit but that's me. I would be happy with any of Dez, Julio, AB, Gronk, OBJ , or even Bell. I wouldn't really trade up from 2.11 unless someone really falls. That'd a great turn to be at. Tons of talent still there."
DynastyFF,3d00vo,Sticky_Z,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:02 2015 UTC,"Would you reach for positional scarcity in the second round like a Gronk (prob gone), Luck, or Watt or keep going WR heavy?"
DynastyFF,3d00vo,Sticky_Z,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:48 2015 UTC,All those guys are prolly gone at 2.11 but I'd go crazy for both of them there. I would grab another WR and take an RB. Killer start to a team. Always try to go bpa so if a stud WR is sitting at 3.02 and you think you can go without an RB till 4.11... Do it. Rb is much easier to fill than WR
DynastyFF,3d00vo,Sticky_Z,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, dynasty drafting is still really unfamiliar to me.  Hoping that a combo of available online dynasty rankings, beersheets, and luck can get me what I want outta draft day."
DynastyFF,3d00vo,fropek,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:43 2015 UTC,DLF is really the best resource. We also run some startup mocks for the first few rounds and that's on the sidebar. I believe beer sheets are for redraft leagues only. So it's good for 2015 projections but dosent take age into account

DynastyFF,3czzed,Ccm120,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:06:12 2015 UTC,"I think you are lacking youth, maybe trade some of those vets for youth and future growth.  You're deep at WR and QB for sure."
DynastyFF,3czzed,HighMakkaMakka,0,Sun Jul 12 09:53:44 2015 UTC,"Your QB situation is nice, RB is really bad, WR is decent, TE solid. I feel like your team will be a 7-10 place finisher which is probably the worse case scenario for a team like yours who has some youth, but not enough. Your going to win just enough games to get you a mid draft pick next season, which isnt going to help turn your team around quicker. If I owned that team, I would blow it up.   M. Ryan, M. Lynch, AJ Green would be the big 3 i would look to move. M. Ryan and AJ Green you can start looking for trades now. make package deals with some of your other medoicre guys Harvin/Maclin/Woods/Herron(handcuff bait for Gore owners)/Sproles(handcuff bait)/Ridley(Handcuff bait) and get some future picks or youth or a combo of both.  Dont look to sell Lynch until a couple games into the season, unless someone is paying good now. injuries will happen, and a chip contender will pay more for lynch mid season when their backs against the wall.   DO NOT trade away your future picks unless you are getting a very young WR, young RB's arent going to do you any good at this point, besides maybe Gurley. Try to get as many Future picks in return for your guys as possible and start building. Try your best not to include any of your youth guys in trades unless they are really good trades."
DynastyFF,3czzed,OP85,3,Sun Jul 12 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"This is not good advice. You need to move 1 QB, either Ryan or Bridgewater - whichever you think will be worse from this point forward. I would probably try and trade Bridgewater as his value may never be higher than it is right now. Ryan is a proven commodity that will finish top 10 at the position every year, sometimes cracking the top 5.  At WR do not trade anyone unless you get a king's random. Getting rid of AJ Green is some of the worst advice I've ever heard. He is a consensus top 5 WR.   As far as Lynch, you'll probably be stuck with him. He's to old to get anything valuable in return right now, but may have more value as the season wears on to a contender.   I'd say you have a pretty good shot at making a run if you can get just one more starting RB. Do not blow this team up, you are a player or two away from being a contender."
DynastyFF,3czzed,fropek,2,Sun Jul 12 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. Ryan, Lynch, AJ Green, Calvin, Jordan Matthews, Maclin, and Bennett is a playoff caliber core. RB2 is lacking for sure, but moving Bridgewater plus maybe a bench WR should net an out of fashion but startable RB2. Depending who you add to Bridgewater and how high the other team is on him, someone like Gio Bernard should be totally attainable. Bridgewater alone is likely enough for someone like Vereen (an underrated RB2 in full PPR) or possibly Alfred Morris (not great in PPR, but still an RB2). If you want to go full on win now for the next 2 or so years, Bridgewater and Dorsett should get you a fringe RB1 even.   But your team is definitely strong enough to make a push now, and not so old that you need to start blowing it up. Realistically you'll probably lose Lynch after this year or next, and Calvin after 3 more years or so, but that's it. No reason to tear it down at all, and as long as you look to add young talent when you can in the next couple years, you really shouldn't need any hard rebuilding period."

DynastyFF,3czr2f,blurredvision14,4,Sun Jul 12 06:49:32 2015 UTC,Yes that's a bad trade Evans top 10 pick in dynasty startup.  This draft class is deep so maybe you get lucky. TY for the 7th and 12th would have been fairer.
DynastyFF,3czr2f,klassicd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:11:43 2015 UTC,"And also much less likely to happen. I dont think OP won this trade, but 'fair value' rarely gets a deal done in my experience."
DynastyFF,3czr2f,wolf_nipple_chips,5,Sun Jul 12 11:06:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you're really not gonna know if you screwed up or not for 2-3 years.  You never know what can happen.  I've seen LOTS of dynasty trades that looked bad at first, but panned out well for the guy who originally got the bad end of the deal.  You definitely sold Evans cheap, but only time will tell.  Good luck."
DynastyFF,3czr2f,gibbsftw,3,Sun Jul 12 14:01:31 2015 UTC,That's definitely a bad trade...but fortunately you can absorb that kinda hit for your WR corps.  Silver lining?
DynastyFF,3czr2f,HighMakkaMakka,2,Sun Jul 12 09:48:18 2015 UTC,"would be better if your league was 1 pt PPR, with acquiring Vereen.  i think you could have gotten more back in a player and picks for Evans.    You're young at WR, and you have a lot of talent there.    Are you planning to draft RBs with those late 1st rd picks?"
DynastyFF,3czr2f,biot78,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:26:08 2015 UTC,you fucked it up dude.
DynastyFF,3czr2f,fantasy_boss,-2,Sun Jul 12 13:28:02 2015 UTC,"I think that's pretty decent.  Vereen us trending up, and those two picks will get you good players at each spot.    Evans is good but I think you have the wr core to absorb the loss."

DynastyFF,3czr2f,blardorg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:23:21 2015 UTC,"Evans is good but I think you have the wr core to absorb the loss.   I agree, but that's not a good reason to make a trade that gets you less value than you could have. If Vereen was an early 1st round pick or someone like CJ Anderson, that would be pretty fair value for Evans. As it is, op just left a decent bit of value on the table."
DynastyFF,3cz8wq,mzkp54,3,Sun Jul 12 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"I would, but I would rather get multiple assets in a rebuild ."

DynastyFF,3cz8wq,Santidreet,3,Sun Jul 12 03:55:18 2015 UTC,"That's pretty fair value. I would prefer that to a straight up. But Adams is a tough player to gauge. He could be great or he could waste most of his career behind two other WRs.   If I were you, I'd be looking to get someone like Amari Cooper/Matthews/Cooks/Allen Robinson and a pick or the equivalent to one. Try proposing trades that are in contention to win it all this year."
DynastyFF,3cz8wq,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"Can't imagine anybody accepting that deal, to be honest."
DynastyFF,3cz8wq,umaro900,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:00 2015 UTC,"If you can get that deal, it's certainly a good one. Your team is desperate for startable players, so having three competent players is going to give you more points than one player who is slightly better. Of course, there's a reasonable chance that one of Agholor, Adams, and that first turn into a better player than Watkins or Alshon, so there is definitely big upside in the 1-for-3 deal."
DynastyFF,3cz8wq,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been getting pretty bad offers for him all offseason, so I doubt I'll get that.  Worth a shot though"

DynastyFF,3cyyrq,darkforce547,12,Sun Jul 12 01:33:59 2015 UTC,Jesus god no
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,massmanx,4,Sun Jul 12 04:30:13 2015 UTC,I think I threw up in my mouth a little reading that trade.
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,atonyatlaw,4,Sun Jul 12 12:59:58 2015 UTC,"Nah, that's not enough, even in 2QB. Bell is a first round pick still, by consensus value if not in your actual league. Teddy is more like back end of the 2nd in a 12 team, something like pick 24. I'd rather keep Bell, and if and when Teddy shows himself to be a high end QB2 or low end QB1, you can still make this kind of deal. With this trade, you're basically assuming Teddy will be a top 6 or 7 QB next year and for the rest of his career. He might be, but you should wait and see that he develops towards that level in 2015 before giving up so much for him."
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,blardorg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:39:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, all the good, young QBs are all collected between 3 teams, so we have to pay a premium for them. My QBs are in a not so great place, and even if Teddy doesn't turn out to be top 6 or 7, he's a better QB than the ones that I see coming out of college the next few years. The 6 points for passing touchdowns really is making me wary of that weakness on my team."
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,Sw33tch1nmusic,4,Sun Jul 12 01:43:22 2015 UTC,Then you're not looking too closely at next year's draft.

DynastyFF,3cyyrq,enigk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"I'm personally not a fan of any of next year's QBs. Hack and Gunner are the two with the most potential, but Hack's starting to develop a case of the Gabberts and I'm just not sold on Gunner."
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,enigk,2,Sun Jul 12 02:52:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like this deal at all, personally.  I'm first to admit I know fuck-all about idp, but your roster seems pretty solid and like you could compete. Flipping bottles from your starting lineup and replacing with teddy is an ok step up, but losing bell from your starting RB corps leaves you way thin and would be a much larger drop off."
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes me consider this deal is that it's a two QB league with 6 point touchdowns. All the quality young QBs are on 3 teams of the 10, so they're costing a premium. Long term, I'm going to need a replacement for Brees, and I just don't see any great QBs in college right now. It may be more of a panic move, though."
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,deRoyLight,2,Sun Jul 12 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"It just leaves you so thin at rb is my issue. You've got a good squad, but without bell I think you're really losing any shot at making a run this year.  I'm in a 2 QB myself, so I understand trying to plan for post-Brees, but I don't think you're getting close to fair value.  Brees still has a few years left, so I'd say sit tight. Hell, for all we know Mallett could end up beating out Hoyer for the Texans job and be serviceable for a few years."
DynastyFF,3cyyrq,NOLA_NOLA_NOLA_NOLA,2,Sun Jul 12 02:24:41 2015 UTC,NO! Leveon is worth way more than that. Your RB situation would completely destroyed and your QB would not be greatly improved. Maybe Teddy and 2 firsts...

DynastyFF,3cyqaa,TheDarkestTimelinez,3,Sun Jul 12 00:09:06 2015 UTC,I like the backend in redraft but in dynasty I think I prefer a top 5 pick. The second-third round turn is still good and it makes your team deeper. It also depends on what you like to pick.
DynastyFF,3cyqaa,Santidreet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who has constantly ended up with a pick around 10-12, I can say I would much prefer a top 3-5 pick. The reason I like this is because you get a top elite player in the first, and generall my target players got around the 2/3 swing, so having the early third is handy."
DynastyFF,3cyqaa,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"I like being Top 3 personally...it's a nice feeling rolling with the no-brainer elite WRs.  (Unless you go QB strategy, same easy choice.)"

DynastyFF,3cy81e,OP85,3,Sat Jul 11 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"Those are all 2-3 first round pick value guys. Established, mid range or better QB1s are worth that in a 2QB league, not a rookie QB that hasn't played a real snap yet. For Winston to be worth that, he would need to be a top 10 QB for his career. Are you 100% sure he will be that? If not, you really need to bring your valuations of him back down to earth! :)"
DynastyFF,3cy81e,blardorg,5,Sun Jul 12 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"You are correct about the 2-3 first rd picks but Id lean closer to 2 1st rders. so based on that we both agree. Il explain why i say what i did, and everything is based on 12 man leagues since those are the most common and is where i based my value from. Obviously 10 and 8 man teams devalue the importance of a QB drastically.   So, what is the 1.01 pick worth in value to other picks right now? answer - 2x 1st rd picks. in a rookie draft right now, if you wanted to trade up from 1.04 to 1.01, it would take an additional 1.09ish maybe a little higher.  thats 2x 1st rders. Well in a lot of 2qb leagues dynasty drafts, Winston is going anywhere from 1.01-1.03.   Now theres not very many rankings for 2qb dynasty leagues, so you have to improv. I dunno what your favorite rankings website/information is, but i like fantasypros. I feel they are the most accurate year in n out. If you were look at that LIST you would see Gurley (being rookie 1.01) lands at 18. now that doesnt account for the list not accounting for 2 qb's. so lets just throw a number out there and say everyone on that list that is not a QB would slide down what 3-8 spots to account for the QB's being valued more and moving up, theres at least 5 QB's that would be taken over those players probably more? I averaged that to 5 spots. so now Gurley (1.01) is worth ranking spot 13.  If you look at whos around pick 13? the players I suggested. That is Winstons ceiling in my opinion at the rookie 1.01. Now if your in a league that isnt hurting for QB's and is more balanced, winston prob drops to around 1.03 in rookie drafts. so lets find who the 1.03 pick is on that list. Gordon at 29. again shift the list 5-6 players now to account for qb's. we have the 1.03 being worth listing 24-23. whos around there? Mccoy, Hilton, Cooks. I think that is Winstons Floor as of right now.  Like i said i dont disagree with what youre saying, but that is my reasoning. Me personally I wouldnt trade Hopkins or anyone else for Winston either. But based on my reasoning, thats what his ceiling is. If you have a better way to figure out rankings like this, please let me know. Im always willing to find out better ways to improve my theories and strategies.  edit: format"
DynastyFF,3cy81e,OP85,2,Sun Jul 12 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"I wanted to come back and say, I was a bit wrong about the list i was using, i forgot to check which experts were giving me results and they had a couple people i dont like/havnt updated their listings in over a 1.5 months. Using my same theory with the adjusted rankings Winston would be ceiling of Nelson, Hill, Graham, JC and a floor, forte, mathews, benjamin, ARob.  Probably sounds a little more on track now. For me it does. Id definitely trade for the floor pieces. if i was the owner of his ceiling, I would have to be hurting for a QB to do that but it seems more reasonable."
DynastyFF,3cy81e,OP85,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's closer to how I think he fits into the rankings too. I'd easily trade any of the floor guys for him, and probably those ceiling guys too :)"

The 2016 QB class is getting a lot of talking up at this early stage, so he might not be too expensive to acquire, or may not get you a lot if you trade him away.  I'd want a random 1st rounder plus a mid-low QB1/WR1. In terms of players I'd have him around Rivers, Romo, Carr or Flacco. Gurley, Hill or Charles. Hilton, Cooks, Matthews or Kelvin.  Edit: but I'd shoot for OP85's players first"
DynastyFF,3cy81e,LastOfTheOsirans,3,Sat Jul 11 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"His APD in 2 QB is really not after Cooper and Gurley. Perhaps in a Dynasty startup where there is more to consider than just taking the best or most valuable player for your pick. But, for rookie drafts, I think the consensus is he's #1 and if you want to trade back to Gurley or Cooper, that's fine as well. But if you are #1 and you aren't taking the QB it's really not playing the values correctly in a 2-QB/superflex.  In my opinion, in a 2QB assuming it's at least 12-teams or higher, it would take Gurley and something considerable to move Winston. It's not a trivial difference in value between the two."
DynastyFF,3cy81e,deRoyLight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting your ADP? In 12 or fewer team leagues, QBs aren't that scarce, and Winston absolutely goes after Cooper, Gurley, and often White and Gordon, in my experience. In larger leagues, QBs get a lot more scarce, so I could definitely see him going earlier in a 14 or 16 team or larger league.   As for ""playing the value,"" rookie QBs have a ton of risk, probably even more so than rookie RBs. I looked it up a month or two ago for a post, but seriously, check all the QBs taken in the top 100 NFL picks the past 4-5 years. So. Many. Busts. Even guys that came in as a starter. If you could be sure Winston would be a starting QB for the rest of his career, even a mediocre one, then sure, I would agree with you about him being the most valuable rookie. But you can't be sure of that, and that pushes guys like Cooper, Gurley, and possibly others above him (in my opinion, of course!)."

The correct thing to do is look at QBs taken #1 overall, or if you want, extend that to top two or three overall. The success rate on QBs taken that highly in the draft is actually pretty good. There are a few exceptions, of course, (Bradford with his injury history, Jamarcus) but it's a pretty good success rate compared to what your odds of landing a QB are virtually anywhere else in the draft.  As for ADP, I think you can look at most DLF 2QB mocks, or, their latest 2 QB ADP (it isn't exclusively rookies, but it has Winston ahead of Gurley and right behind Cooper in total ADP, however in pure rookie ADP it's typically Winston).   The thing about QB is it's incredibly valuable and incredibly SAFE. There are so few good, young QB prospects with a high draft pedigree right now in an environment where the top QBs are getting up in age, that to have one is basically to own gold. You are extremely insulated. For one, people tend to give QBs the TE treatment of time to develop (plenty of time to recoup your value if you want out), and two it's a combination of scarcity plus long-term security. Being right on Gurley means a few years, maybe more of elite RB production. Being right on Cooper means on average a few more years than that. Being right on Winston, however, and you're talking about a position where the elite players are playing deep into their thirties. That is a ton, ton of value potential and a very strong bottom floor when you take a QB.  RG3 is STILL worth something in 2QB leagues. Bradford can net you a first from someone willing to buy into his situation. Bortles, even after a dismal rookie year, is still an incredibly valuable asset. QBs drafted highly in the NFL draft get a lot of wiggle room and their value sticks for a very long time, even when they don't pan out.  Edit: Here's an example on DLF (http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/2015-rookie-adp/).  Look at the tabs on the bottom and find ""2QB Post Draft."" As soon as the Bucs took him #1, giving him the NFL's stamp of approval (and pairing him with Mike Evans), his ADP jumped above Gurley and Cooper. I have heard at least one podcast say they would take Cooper or Gurley over Winston regardless of whether it was 2 QB or not, but I completely disagree and they are going against the grain I believe."
DynastyFF,3cy81e,deRoyLight,2,Sun Jul 12 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"The correct thing to do isn't to look at QBs taken in the top 100. The correct thing to do is look at QBs taken #1 overall, or if you want, extend that to top two or three overall.   Neither is perfect. I know what you mean, but because the teams with the top N picks might have bigger needs than a QB, it isn't correct to say that Winston/whoever is a better talent because they were taken at 1, 2, or 3, than a QB that was taken at 5 or 10 or 15. But I know what you mean and agree that some allowance should be made for talent! I tried to cast a wide net when I originally did it with top 100 picks, as that includes guys like Russell Wilson that would've been excluded even doing just 1st round QBs. The hit rate was actually better (iirc) if you do something like top 100 picks than if you just do top 20 or first round.   RG3 is STILL worth something in 2QB leagues. Bradford can net you a first from someone willing to buy into his situation. Bortles, even after a dismal rookie year, is still an incredibly valuable asset.   So using the same kind of logic as with QBs, what is the hit rate on WRs taken in the top ~5 picks in the draft? Calvin, AJ Green, Julio Jones, Mike Evans? Yes please to any of those over RG3, Bradford, or Bortles.   I don't disagree that QB is the most valuable position in 2QB leagues. I do disagree that any top rookie QB is necessarily more valuable than any top rookie non-QB, though. Mariota went 2nd overall, and I don't see you or any others arguing he should be 1.02 in 2QB rookie drafts. Winston is a fine talent, and I'd be happy to get him in a 2QB league. But I will happily take the next AJ Green or AP over the next Johnny Football or Blake Bortles, hah! (Just in case, that last comment is not serious, as Cooper and Gurley are risky assets themselves. But it does reflect that I think they are comparatively safer and more valuable than Winston or Mariota :) !)"
DynastyFF,3cy81e,blardorg,2,Sun Jul 12 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"Mariota is a curious case because he's not a traditional QB, and fantasy players recognize that. The NFL gave its stamp of approval on him but there is a lot more projecting for him to make it in the NFL than there is for Winston, or your typical QB taken that highly.    As for your point about AJ Green, Julio, Evans etc. Yes, receivers taken in the top 10/top 5 are extremely high hit rates as well (exceptions being those speedy-only receivers, like heyward-bey, tavon austin etc). In the same way you have to exclude those speedy players at the top of the draft for receiver, I think you have to extend the same courtesy to running QBs and understand that they have to be treated differently in value because they are considered to have much more dangerous floors than the norm.  AJ Green, Julio, Evans, Calvin etc are all more valuable than RG3, Bradford, Bortles, that is correct (although any one of those QBs can be more valuable than those in a heartbeat with a good season). I think the point there is I was mentioning players that didn't work out, and showing that they still have a ton of value regardless for quite a while because of their positional insulation. Comparing them to receivers that did work out seems unfair. It would be like me comparing Andrew Luck, Philip Rivers and Eli Manning to Roy Williams, Charles Rodgers etc. I was just pointing out that the bottom floor is much higher and the ceiling is much higher as well. There are indeed top-drafted QBs that don't work out, but they usually give you plenty of time to get out of their value if you need to."
DynastyFF,3cy81e,deRoyLight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fully concede there's cherry picking on those WRs. I think on Winston, we'll just have to agree to disagree. I think we're actually not disagreeing much, anyway; I'm totally fine with a team taking Winston at 1.01 if they think he'll make it big. And I definitely agree 2QB inflates QBs values a ton. I just don't think Winston is in the Luck or RG3 level of rookie QBs, so I don't think he's automatically 1.01 in 2QB leagues. But 1.03, sure, so we're not off on our valuations by much!  Edit: I just saw your edit with the DLF mocks two replies ago. Yeah, I saw DLF's new 2QB rankings, but they're only based on two guys' rankings, and looks like those mocks are only from two mock drafts. I'm just not sure there is a strong consensus on 2QB rankings, as I've found others with Winston at 1.04 (posted in a top level comment here). I wish it was more popular (along with IDP), as I like superflex/2QB, but resources are a little short for it."
DynastyFF,3cy81e,blardorg,2,Sun Jul 12 02:57:05 2015 UTC,"What most folks isn't taking into account is that most of the current top QBs is shortly out of the league(Peyton, Brees, Brady and even Romo/Eli, who isn't even top QBs). Who's left? Sure ARod and Luck is gonna be great, but who else? Matt Ryan and Big Ben are gonna stick around, but isn't exactly young or TOP notch. Bridgewater and Tanny(more so) has shown promise, but are they gonna be as dominant as Peyton or Brees have been?  A new pack of quality QBs is coming and I would be ranking Jameis very high(prolly higher than most) in this group. In a start 2QB league, I would sell for another young stud like Gurley/Hop/Cobb/Watkins.   EDIT: I would like to emphasis that I'm probably a lot higher on Winston than others"

Coming from a Jaguar fan I'd rather be on the Strong/Seferian-Jenkins/2016 & 2017 1st side (mainly bc the 2016 & 2017 1st). But I also am a believer in paying for what the player is worth, and not what he could be worth. Robinson averaged just over 9pts a game in .5 PPR before getting hurt. There's no reason he can't pick up from there and continue to improve but IMO there's better to be had for that price."
DynastyFF,3cy372,gospeedracergooo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Ya a bit overpaid. I think Strong + ASJ + one of the future draft picks would have been sufficient. not a huge over pay. but hey, if ARob is that high for you. go for it. If he blows up you look like a genius."

And I'm young as is, so missing those first round picks isn't the end of the world, when if worst comes to worst I can move up with other picks if there's someone I must have. I think I overpaid, but my situation allowed me to do that and not be in too bad of shape."

DynastyFF,3cy45v,HighMakkaMakka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:38:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm thats a unique draft approach, never heard of it before. If im understanding you correctly, you get to pick your first rd slot? it snakes to the 2nd rd? then the 3rd rd + every odd rd after that is randomized with the correlating even rds being snaked back?  I would say you have to go with a top 3 or bottom 2 strat. because every rd after that will be completely out of your control, so either you want a A+++ + A+ or you get 2x A++ guys."
DynastyFF,3cy45v,OP85,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have the idea. There has been a lot of discussion about how certain draft slots are better, overall, than others. This is our method for avoiding that imbalance. It certainly isn't perfect, but, in general it even things out.   Another reason I like it is because there are certain people you may not want to draft next to. Maybe they are the ones that did the most research. Maybe they have a similar style to yours. With this approach you aren't stuck next to them for the whole draft.   As far as getting to choose first round order...I just thought that was a little more interesting. Being able to slot yourself somewhere if there is a particular player you want to target."
DynastyFF,3cxczv,zymurgophile,4,Sat Jul 11 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'm on the Hopkins side of this if I'm not on a totally stacked team right now (90% of the time, let's say). Hopkins may not produce like AJ Green right now, but that doesn't mean he won't by the time he's Green's age. His QBs may hold him back, but Hopkins produces when given the opportunity. He was 2nd in the NFL in drop rate in 2013 and although I don't have a PFF sub to get the same data from this year, he was still very efficient. With Andre gone, he is undoubtedly the focus of the passing game, and he figures to get more targets to improve on his 1000 yards from last year. Remember Hopkins is still 4 prime years younger than Green, so even if he never shines as brightly as Green, he can still be just as valuable, if not moreso.   Colston I don't put a ton of stock in, but he has the potential to soak up a lot of targets Graham and Stills left over. He probably adds some value to the trade, but the amount heavily depends on your league and roster.   The 2016 first is what makes the deal for me. Sure, I'd rather have Green than Hopkins in most situations, but I don't think the gap is a future 1st-round pick, even if the other dude has a stacked roster."
DynastyFF,3cxczv,umaro900,3,Sat Jul 11 17:14:50 2015 UTC,Totally agreed here. I love me some nuk. Give me all the shares. I like AJG of course but I think the team is rather stacked for receivers with just a mediocre QB. The first seals it for me
DynastyFF,3cxczv,Sticky_Z,2,Sat Jul 11 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"I think from a value standpoint this is pretty fair depending on where the 1st will be. Will depend on your roster. If you're more win now stick with AJG, if you're looking to win in 1-2years go hopkins."
DynastyFF,3cxczv,Ballinandfallin,2,Sat Jul 11 17:21:51 2015 UTC,Hopkins side for sure. He is a quarterback away from being a perennial top 5 WR
DynastyFF,3cxczv,fropek,2,Sat Jul 11 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"AJ Green 100% of the time. If that pick is top 3, I'll consider it if Colston were swapped out for someone better and younger."

DynastyFF,3cwq2u,SFerno91,3,Sat Jul 11 12:57:05 2015 UTC,I would just keep taking upside RB guys.  If one hits you are more competitive than you might think. If not you have a nice core to build around and should trade off veterans to needy teams mid season to help gather draft assets.
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,JoshNipples,3,Sat Jul 11 13:19:38 2015 UTC,"Your guys are not the guys I would.have picked. I dislike the team, but I respect what you were going for with it. I feel like you've got a lot of guys who are big on hype. If the hype.is justified on all of them you'll be the best team in the league by a wide margin. I'm not at all sold on Mariota, Abdullah, Cobb, Eifert, or Crowell.  Even guys I like (Kelce, Bryant, Freeman) all have some risk associated. I wouldn't be at all shocked to see Freeman getting replaced mid season even if he plays well, for example. Kelce is the best receiver getting thrown to by Alex Smith. Hell, even Julio has an injury history.   This is the epitome of a high risk, high reward team. I own many of those guys and will continue to draft them, just not all in the same league."
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,chkessle,2,Sun Jul 12 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no complaints from me, looks good for a nice young team building for the next couple years. Good QB, fantastic WR, and great TE. For going zero RB, your RBs do still have some potential, with Crowell having a chance against Duke Johnson, Freeman having a chance against Coleman, and Abdullah and Cobb looking like possible RB1s for their teams."
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,blardorg,2,Sat Jul 11 13:30:01 2015 UTC,Looks likes a team I might have drafted for myself. Very well done.  Edit: I'd keep a close eye on Kelce's value going forward since he's older than most would guess. Probably worth having him on the block permanently.
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,quickonthedrawl,2,Sat Jul 11 15:08:07 2015 UTC,"I don't want to ruin the party since everyone appears to love your team, but when I first looked at this team I thought it had to be like a 16 team league or something. I can see Julio Jones as your 1st round pick, but I sort of get lost after that. I think you went way too much on youth and not nearly enough on established veterans. You have Julio Jones and Big Ben as the only guys who've done it.   Overall what you would expect for a zero RB squad, but if this is truly a dynasty, you need more veterans and the best shot at that is the startup.  FWIW, in a dynasty league (especially one that requires 2 RB starters) zero RB is not a good strategy unless everyone is going RB but in that case you would have a WR corp that looks like Julio, Dez, Jordy or Cobb.  This team could be contending in a few years, but you will need to hit on some of these RBs and definitely hit on future rookie picks.  TL:DR you will need a lot of things to fall your way to be competitive."
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,racer--x,2,Sat Jul 11 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"Julio, Hopkins, and Cooper were quite clearly the top 3 picks, and each of them are premium assets. Not sure what the issue is with that? And he tacked on two top ~30 guys in Parker and Bryant. OP's WR corps is as good as it gets in a startup."
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,quickonthedrawl,2,Sat Jul 11 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and either one drafted as his WR3 or 3rd pick would have been fine. But both of them have 1 year of NFL experience between them and are behind shaky QBs. My overall criticism of OPs team was it too young and reliant on rookies or guys who have not established themselves yet. I can make a case for most of the guys on his team, I just think its too young and too reliant on potential."
DynastyFF,3cwq2u,racer--x,3,Sat Jul 11 16:34:25 2015 UTC,I love it. I generally draft in a similar way. Great squad. Those Wr's roll deep and there will always be RB's splashing onto the scene

DynastyFF,3cv4cw,Unpossible42,3,Sat Jul 11 00:55:17 2015 UTC,Make the 2nd QB a Super-Flex (QB/WR/RB/TE). Especially in 10 team this will allow for a lot of flexibility in roster and lineup building.
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,thefadd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"I see where you're going, but I really don't like this.  While your 'flex' QB might not be putting up constant 30-40 point games, 20 points isn't exactly hard to put up ... but somebody who plays their 3rd RB or 2nd TE ... or 4th WR ... in this slot just isn't going to compete with well against somebody with even the #15 QB on a weekly basis.  People will still want to put a QB in there, so I don't think it really resolves the problem.  I could be wrong, but that's what I feel."
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,greebytime,3,Sat Jul 11 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"Just posted above but I've done that format for years and almsot everybody drafts to start 2 QB. It's really bye weeks where it changes things up ... and everybody can screw their own team any way they want, right?

I only take a 3rd QB if I think there's a legit name out there who I'm excited about, otherwise I just improvise on bye weeks or make trades by that time in the year."
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,adrianp07,2,Sat Jul 11 22:36:09 2015 UTC,"The conflict your league member poses is exactly what it seems like you're after. In a 1QB league you don't even have to draft one to have a starter and I wouldn't ever go after rookie qbs. On the other hand, 2QBs forces everyone to be more strategic and thoughtful before and during the draft. In our 10 team draft, the person with picks 10 and 11 went Wilson and newton. He was only 1 of 2 players that went qb/qb but it definitely made people reevaluate their later picks. There were still other qbs later in the draft (at round 7 I got Rivers) but you definitely don't want to wait too long! But that's what makes the draft and the league fun!  Good luck either way!"

DynastyFF,3cv4cw,greebytime,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:46:02 2015 UTC,"As someone said, the superflex helps that 30 QB out of 32 problem. Also, remind the concerned owner that if someone gets injured, their backup becomes a top32 QB if you see what I mean. So if you draft Rodgers, draft his backup. 2 QB make Qb's valuable but I like that because it is the most important position in the NFL. Also, it allows for interesting strategies. With 2QB startup drafts, most people will take QB's in the first few rounds. But some people elect to ""punt"" QB. They will have much better WR/RB's then most teams, but worse QBs."
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,Millsstg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"But drafting a backup QB just means you're forced in to drafting 4 QBs ... 2x QB for starting, 1x QB for Bye Weeks, and 1x QB as a backup.    While I'm not saying drafting a backup for Rodgers is a bad idea, I don't think it resolves the problem of a QB shortage ... you still have the shortage.  That didn't change ... all you did was draft yet another QB to hedge your bet (but most likely just giving away money instead of winning it, as gambling goes)."
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,masteroftheuniverse6,2,Sat Jul 11 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"Well in a dynasty when the rosters are big and you don't have the luxury of picking up players willy nilly, you have to use the super flex on a bye week.

We actually play in a 1-QB league, but your Flex can be a QB. So most every week, guys start 2-QB. However, on bye weeks, things get crazy. Folks would rather not start Josh McCown or whatever guy the Bills are rolling out that week ... so they'll start 3 RB, or 4 WR or even 2 D/ST.   Highly recommended."
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,JDriley,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"2-D/ST -- I like it. Most super flex leagues I see posted specify QB/RB/WR/TE (although they could just be leaving the rest off). I was looking at puttin together an IDP league with an any position ""mega flex"" but the MFL settings somewhat difficult for this. I should email them."
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,JDriley,2,Sat Jul 11 03:09:25 2015 UTC,We use MFL for my QB-flex league...I was commissioner of it for a few years and I thought it was pretty much customizable for anything. Their support is also quite good so you should be able to get what you need.
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,JDriley,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:35:10 2015 UTC,Yes I just did my first dynasty superflex startup a month ago. Some people will always think the 2qb way is not necessary and it just makes it that more important to make sure you get your qbs earlier than normal. I got tannehill at 2.9. Kaep at 8.9. Carr at 6.9. RgIII at 14.9 and still have developmental players in the waiver.
DynastyFF,3cv4cw,deRoyLight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"2QBs is dumb with 12 or more teams. You have to adapt a special superflex just to get around it. It's just too limited of a position. 10 teams, sure."

DynastyFF,3cv7qn,darkforce547,2,Sat Jul 11 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"First, the good news. You have great starting RBs, good RB depth in PPR, a great starting TE, and pretty solid IDPs.   However, you've got two significant holes in your roster: QB and WR. First, QB. In 2QB, 6 pt passing TD, QB is undoubtedly the number one requirement to compete. High end QBs will be averaging close to 30 points per game. Bortles is an incredibly weak QB2, especially in a 10 team league. I think he averaged something like 14 ppg last year. That should go up this year, but he's probably not going to be a top 20 QB. Before you'll be able to compete, you really need a quality QB2, and in just a year or two you might need a replacement for Brees too.  Second, your WRs are quite weak too. OBJ is a good WR1 with a bit of risk, Martavis is a WR3 with WR2 upside, and...that's about it for you in terms of good starting WRs. Jones, Latimer, and Quick all have potential, but also a ton of risk. Marvin Jones was very TD dependent two years ago, and that was a year when Dalton was unreal. Who knows how he'll do this year. Quick at least showed decent potential, but had a relatively severe injury and was already somewhat of a late bloomer, so it's unclear whether that was just a flash in the pan. Latimer hasn't shown anything, and at best isn't going to be more than maybe the 5th target in Denver, after DT, Sanders, CJ Anderson, and Daniels/Green. I expect you'll be starting Vereen at flex far more than any of your WRs, but even still, I expect you have a much weaker WR3 and somewhat weaker WR2 than most of your leaguemates.   So I spent a lot of time harping on the bad parts, but I do want to emphasize you have a great base at RB, TE, and IDP. I think even with your QB and WR issues, you'll have an outside shot at the playoffs, as long as Brees doesn't fall off a cliff. I just think you're a bit too weak at QB and WR to be more than a fringe playoff team in the short term. Strengthen those a bit without giving up a lot of value elsewhere and I think you'll be in good shape!"
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,blardorg,2,Sat Jul 11 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"Except this is also a dynasty league. So some of the weaknesses also hold future value. That being said, you are right from a win now stand point."
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,Canesjags4life,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this was my exact reaction coming out of the draft. I felt incredibly solid at RB with a lot of talent that should only improve. I lucked into Kelce and Ebron at great value, and my most confident area was my IDPs.  Unfortunately, I fell into an awkward spot with QBs. I was the 7th pick, and 4 of the first 6 picks were quarterbacks. Rodgers, Luck, Wilson, and Roethlisberger. By the time that I got to my second pick, Romo, Cam, Stafford and Ryan were all gone. I wanted Romo, but at 2.4, I hated the QB value, so I went with OBJ. When I took Brees in the 4th, he was the 11th QB off the board. The value just was never great. I essentially felt forced into my starting QBs. When I started really noticing that, I tried to take a few extra high future value receivers to trade for a QB in the future. That said, I'm actually pretty happy with Bortles for the long term. While he wasn't spectacular last year, he's got a great receiving corps. AR and Julius Thomas are top shelf with Hurns and Greene being intriguing options as well.  When I saw how my QBs were turning out, I decided to look more towards the future than this year. I think that's best reflected in my receiving corps. OBJ and Bryant should both be productive this year, and I see Jones being a solid option, as well. That said, I think that it's the youth of this group that's really going to benefit me in the long run. Of the receivers you talked about as high potential, Latimer's actually the one that excites me the most. While he didn't play much last year, all reports have been that he has the best pure hands of any Denver receiver. Combining that with the skill set that we saw on his college tape, that made me confident in picking him for the future. Smelter, McBride and Janis were all picks that fall into a similar category. The biggest risk here was likely Crabtree, but I'm betting on him returning to early SF form with a more reliable QB. So, while this group is definitely weak this year, in the future, I actually see this as a strength.  As for my flex, for this year, you're right. It's likely going to be Vereen starting for the majority of the year.  At the end of the day, I'm actually pretty excited because of where my value lies. While I may not have much success immediately, my team's built to last. I've got some good trade pieces to get resources that I need or to just generate value and fill spots on their own in the future.  Thanks for the analysis and advice!"

Even with the QB settings, it makes a lot more sense to grab OBJ and Bell than to reach really hard for a QB. I think you made the right decision, and some other guys will likely have shot themselves in the foot a little bit by going for lower tier QBs so early."
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,Canesjags4life,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"This team will have a really really tough time competing in the next year maybe even 2.   In a 2 qb 6 pt TD dynasty league OP may have made it a priority to grab one great but young qbs ala Tanny, Russel, Luck, etc and a on his way out vet ala Romo and stash Bortles, Carr, etc.   WR is a weakness for the win now mode but holds a lot of future value. ODB will be the top WR within 3 to 4 years and is already top 10. Thats huge. Bryant and Quick are great young WRs that have the potential to be solid wr2s especially with PPR. Quick was a ppr machine b4 he got last season. Latimer has a lot of upside with DTs contract in the air and Sanders getting old. They wont be putting up a lot of points this season, but this WR core will be solid in the next few years. I am sad though that he didnt mix in more of the outstanding rookies. AR15 would have been a solid pick up to pair with Bortles.   RBs are solid from a win now perspective and for future value, excluding your bench. Shane vereen is old and is a flex at best. Helu will be useful because hes so great out of the back field for passing, but hes on the wrong side of 25 and Murray is leading that OAK backfield.   OPs IDPs look great for win now mixed with some good future value. LB and DBs are solid. Dont know enough about the DL."
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,Canesjags4life,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I fell at an awkward spot for QBs, and I really didn't want to reach for someone. Even for the inflated value of QBs, I felt that many were fairly overdrafted. By the time that I made my second pick, 8 QBs were already gone. I could have picked Teddy or Tannehill there, but the value just didn't look good to me. That said, I feel I may have been just as guilty, overdrafting Brees at 4.4.  As for my receiving corps, I really wanted AR15. I was going to take him in the 8th round, but he got snagged just before my pick at 8.3. I tried to go by upside with most of the receivers, and they all happened to be in great situations for the future. Snagging OBJ in the 2nd just felt like amazing value even if it meant missing out on a QB.  As for Vereen and Helu, they're definitely stopgaps. There are some RBs on waivers that I'm going to be watching very closely during training camp, and next year's RB class looks nearly as strong as this year's. I do really like Helu, though. He's a player that has excited me for a few years. He just needs carries, and I think that he starts to get them in Oakland. Murray isn't a great pass catcher or blocker, something that Helu excels at, so I think that he sees the field more than most would expect. Vereen, I think, is just a good player. He's in a great offense to take advantage of his talents, and he has no real competition. While he may not be around for the long run, he's in a good place to contribute for a few years. If he gets injured, though, he's one of the first players that I'm looking at moving.  Thanks for the analysis!"
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,Canesjags4life,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:10:31 2015 UTC,"In a 2 qb league with 6 pt per passing TD, QBs are king. Its not reaching if guys like Luck, Rodgers, Manning, Rivers, Wilson, Stafford, Big Ben are gone by mid 2nd rd. More importantly its a dyansty 2 qb league. Even more reason to get someone elite thats young like Tanny.   Because of your QB situation you are probably going to have to make moves to trade for talented youth and like all the Jaguar fans pray that Bortles is the Prince that was Promised."
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,manningn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:21:13 2015 UTC,"Likely I'm going to make some moves, and soon. It definitely caught me off guard when that many QBs were gone before 2.4. This weekend, I'm combing over everyone's rosters for need. I've already eliminated some teams altogether because the players just don't add value the way I want them to.  That's actually part of the reason that I went with Mallett, too. I just plain and simple don't trust the next couple of years of QBs to be franchise guys. Mallett at least still has interesting potential.  Hopefully I'll be raising my Bortles when the season comes."
DynastyFF,3cv7qn,Canesjags4life,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"For real. Winston has potential to be great, but next seasons rookies look meh at best. Id try and get tanny personally. Kid is getting better every year and hes got some young weapons in Landry and Miller.   You shouldnt have been too off guard. Difference between elite qbs and good qbs becomes huge with the TD points. In std scoring leagues theres not a big difference between top 5 qb and top 20 qb. Not so much when TDs go up. Its the reason that top RBs are gone past pick 2.5. All about the replacement value.   Dont sweat it though. Make moves and your good to go. We are all going to be raising our Bortles."

DynastyFF,3cul5l,MrCarlosDanger,2,Fri Jul 10 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd pay around 1.08 for Gore, especially considering you are in win-now mode.  So your 2nd/3rd is good value.

DynastyFF,3ctbmm,Dr_Lollygag,7,Fri Jul 10 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"Undervalued, I think if he could get some decent quarter back play he'd be money. Guys a beast when he's healthy, there's a reasons they moved up for him."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,nsherman72,5,Fri Jul 10 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"Tough to say he's undervalued when he's a top 15 or so dynasty pick and isn't expected to put up WR1 numbers for a couple years. Long term value is there, but you can't ignore that for the next 1-2 years, you'd probably be happy with him being WR#20 in terms of production, with Rex Ryan and Manuel/Cassel/whoever running the offense."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,blardorg,3,Fri Jul 10 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"He's perfect if you're planning to punt a startup or rebuild. If you want to win, he would have to be your WR3."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,Santidreet,2,Fri Jul 10 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"I'm also in the undervalued camp. If it weren't for OBJ, I'd say he was the top WR talent in his draft class. I can't imagine his production if he suited up for lets say Eagles/Broncos or like 10 other teams for the matter. Rex Ryan has never had a QB/WR combo. His best is what, Sanchez+Holmes?? I wouldn't be eager to move him.. I'd love to get him for the price of Kevin White. I think they're similar high ceiling guys in situations that put them more at their floor."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,aussiemac24,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else, I love the talent, but the situation is terrible.  I would love him on my team, but I'm holding off till next offseason to make a move.  He'll be closer to playing to his full potential (his situation can't get any worse, can it? and his current owner might be running out of patience).  I'm fine taking the risk that he might have a great year, but personally would bet on his value being the same if not lower next year.  I think the players it would take to get him now will grow more in value than he will this time next year."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,mooustached_walrus,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:49 2015 UTC,"Rex Ryan hasn't had a WR like Watkins before and knows this. His son also played football for Clemson while Watkins was there, and not to forget the 3-157-1 game he had against the Jets first time around.  Question: We all know what Buffalo invested in Watkins last year. You guys don't have a first-round pick this year. How big of a priority is it to make him your feature weapon on offense?  Rex: Well, I can tell you trying to defend Sammy Watkins, any time we tried to play man coverage on him, I got burned. He had a 90-yard catch. I think he had a 70-yard touchdown run. So I learned my lesson. The next week I doubled him every single snap. I mean every single snap. And so it's not about his production. Sammy is a one in every 10-year player that comes down the road. You mentioned we don't have a first-round pick. That's OK with me. We have Sammy Watkins. I think it's not just about his production but what he does to open things up for the entire offense. That's the mark of a really great player. Clearly Sammy is one of those players.   Second time around Watkins went 3-35, but while all the attention was on him Robert Woods went 9-118-1 (who is no Sammy, but certainly talented)."

DynastyFF,3ctbmm,SilverViper,3,Fri Jul 10 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"Sammy is an unreal talent but I'm not touching that situation with a ten foot pole. Sorry. Sammy's dynasty ADP nets him as the 13th WR off the board. He certainly has the talent but unless he gets traded I'd rather take my chances elsewhere. I see this as Stevie Johnson 2.0. Good WR in a terrible WR system puts up consistent WR3/fringe WR2 numbers. I do think EJ is not nearly as bad as most think though, I just believe that Watkins is way riskier than people are willing to admit."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,quickonthedrawl,9,Fri Jul 10 17:32:07 2015 UTC,Except Johnson was a 7th round pick. Watkins was the fourth overall! Huge difference in pedigree.
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,SilverViper,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:34:50 2015 UTC,Your point is that because he is a fourth overall he will blossom? Antonio Brown was a 6th rounder. I know he is the exception and not the rule but there are tons of examples that go both ways(Tavon Austin anyone?). I'd say Watkins has established himself as a capable receiver. His ceiling is going to be limited by play calling and QB play in my opinion.
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,quickonthedrawl,6,Fri Jul 10 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. I'm saying comparing Watkins to Stevie Johnson is not appropriate except that they were both Buffalo Bills. Watkins is (objectively, IMO) more talented in virtually every metric.  It took Stevie three years before he had a season like Watkins' rookie year, and that was his career peak performance.  But with regard to Watkins' draft position, yeah, I think that does correlate really strongly with NFL performance. How many WRs taken in the top 5 have been busts? In the last 15 years that's Charles Rogers, Andre Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, Braylon Edwards, Calvin Johnson, A.J. Green, Justin Blackmon, and Sammy Watkins. Edit: (3 Hall of Famers, 1 All-Pro, 2 extraordinary talents with drug problems, and a guy who had a 16 TD season before flaming out... and Watkins).  That's a pretty sick hit rate. I'm going to be betting on Watkins as long as he keeps performing."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,SilverViper,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Watkins will be bad. I don't think he will be. Quite the contrary. I think he will put up numbers, but I'm not sure he is going to be super consistent week to week given that he is on a team that is really focused on a young defense and pounding the ball. I'd rather take Hopkins or trade down and take a stab at Cooper or Cooks though as I like their situations better.   As for talent at the top of the draft...it's a nit picked stat. I'm sure there's a stat for RBs and Trent Richardson was the exception. I'm sure if you stretch it back to Top 10 WRs you get more failures as Austin and Heyward-Bay are in recent memory.  It's a nice stat with a track record for sure but so is OP's stat about sexy rexy not having a WR crack 1k in the last 6 years.   Just to be clear here: I think Watkins performs ok over his career but I don't think he is a top 10 receiver over his career like people here are betting on."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,quickonthedrawl,3,Fri Jul 10 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yep that's fair, I arbitrarily picked ""top 5"" to make a point, and because it was faster to go through the draft lists. :) But with how good NFL teams (generally) are at talent evaluation, I would expect a correlation to continue down through the first round, and probably much deeper also.  Agreed with regard to Hopkins, although I do have Watkins over Cooper/Cooks myself. I could see them all being on the same tier though, so that makes it pretty easy to side one way or another based on whatever criteria that matters most to you.  One final point on Watkins: Calvin Johnson didn't have a good QB either when he entered the league. Neither did Larry Fitzgerald, or A.J. Green, or Andre Johnson. Yet between the four of them, they have 13 top 5 fantasy WR seasons - and countless more as WR1/WR2!"

DynastyFF,3ctbmm,Tcrowaf,2,Sat Jul 11 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think his point is that Stevie Johnson is an overachieving late round pick, and Sammy Watkins has the ceiling of a top 5 kind of talent.

DynastyFF,3ctbmm,Theczarcasticone,2,Fri Jul 10 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"Consider where he probably was on most team's draft boards. He wouldn't have dropped to the second round most likely. Stevie Johnson was never held in that high of regard for the right reasons.   The comparison is just a little lazy. Maybe base a comparison off of similar college numbers, combine scores, QB talent, offensive scheme, style of play, or season stats. Not just the team they went to."
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,blardorg,3,Fri Jul 10 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I guess I don't get the objections to him comparing Watkins and Stevie Johnson when he laid out exactly how he thinks they're comparable: an admittedly good/talented WR that struggles to put up great fantasy numbers given the situation he's in. I understand disagreeing and thinking that Watkins will do better than that, but I just read it as speculation about the fantasy production of them, not /u/SilverViper saying ""Watkins = Stevie Johnson."""
DynastyFF,3ctbmm,Theczarcasticone,3,Fri Jul 10 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that boiling down to the idea that they're both good receivers in bad situations or whatever is an oversimplification.

DynastyFF,3ctbmm,SilverViper,2,Fri Jul 10 18:32:13 2015 UTC,Thank you. :) I'm looking at it much more from a situation standpoint versus a talent one. Great talent can outperform situation though(see Josh Gordon). But it comes with huge risks that I think can be averted at his ADP.

If so, you could forgo this draft and just trade picks alone for him. 2 1sts and 2 2nds should do it.

DynastyFF,3ctsiw,chiefst,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:55:52 2015 UTC,Alshon and DT are basically equal value in my opinion. I highly doubt u get him and 1.04 straight up for DT.   I'd personally prefer OBJ to Alshon by a bit so if DT plus 1.10 gets that done its worth considering.
DynastyFF,3ctsiw,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I cant imagine getting 1.04 and Alshon for DT straight up, but with all my picks he might bite on 1.04 and Alshon for DT and 2.03, or something like that."
DynastyFF,3ctsiw,Thekobra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"I like this too.. You win either trade in my opinion. If you did this, I think you could turn your 3 firsts into OBJ. If you wanted to try and save a 1st round pick you might be able to turn your 1.03 into 2 late 1sts and have 4 firsts and trade 3 for OBJ and keep 1 for Agholor or similar late 1st round talent."

DynastyFF,3cu2gl,aussiemac24,2,Sat Jul 11 00:39:01 2015 UTC,"I agree on parker and agholor I'm not sold on perriman, he has no hands! I'd go Gurley/Gordon at 3 and then pick the best wr at 8. I'd think agholor or dgb would have to be there."

DynastyFF,3ctm4s,don_dryden,11,Fri Jul 10 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"I think you have to go Gurley and Cooper with 1 and 2. You're not in a position to compete this year, so you shouldn't really be too sad missing out on Melvin Gordon and getting someone like White or Parker at 1.04 instead. If you were competing, I could understand preferring Gurley, Gordon, and White to Gurley, Cooper, and White, but you're not competing, and you need WR help almost as much as RB help. Take BPA, meaning Gurley, Cooper, and probably White, and plan to grab an RB or two during the season or during next year's draft."
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,blardorg,5,Fri Jul 10 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Draft best player available. This running back talent is deep. Assuming you have a second round pick... Possibly an early one, take one there. Or if yeldon somehow falls to the say the 8th pick, make an aggressive move and move up to get him."

DynastyFF,3ctm4s,nsherman72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"I like this too. Gurley is an amazing talent that you'll want for awhile. I think the sad thing about Cooper is where he is right now, only good thing is that Oakland will need to throw a lot. I think White would be the best pick for 1.4 as he's a big target for Cutler in the redzone and should be in Chi for awhile"
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,maddenite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"agreed....and that is how I am leaning. Granted, we have a month or so before the draft, so a lot may change between now and then, but I will most likely take Gurley and Cooper, then best available at 1.04"
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,chiefst,4,Tue Jul 14 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Take Cooper and Gurley at the 1.01 and 1.02, sit and wait for Gordon at 1.04, if hes not there, trade back to the 1.06 and pick up a early/mid-2nd, take Yeldon and BPA in the 2nd, my suggestions would be Funchess, Dav. Johnson, Buck Allen"
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,Sw33tch1nmusic,2,Fri Jul 10 20:33:25 2015 UTC,Your WR's outside of Julio aren't great. I think you need to grab Cooper and Gurley 1 and 2 then grab White at 4. Your WR corps will be set for years and you can make due with Mason/Gurley and Ivory this season. Maybe swing a trade for a win now RB like Lynch if you are in it.   If not I'd want more then 1.10 and 2.01 for 1.04. Im actually sitting on 1.04 in my league. I have Alshon and not crazy about pairing him with White on the same squad. To trade down 3 to 5 spots I'd want an additional 2016 1st
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,Santidreet,2,Fri Jul 10 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt I'm going Cooper Gurley,  then best available at 1.04. Go with how you rank people.   I think in the top 8 players of this draft you have some very good value.  If you can trade down and still get who you like in a lower spot and gain a 2nd to go with it,  I'd say go for it. My rank of top 8 players is as follows(yes I know it's not very in line with popular opinion):  1 Cooper 2 Gurley 3 Parker  4 Gordon  5 Yeldon 6 Algholor 7 White 8 Abdullah   If you were to end up with Cooper,  Gurley,  and say Gordon/Yeldon, I think you'd actually have an outside shot at competing with this roster.  I personally would try and trade that 4 down to the 6 range and try and nab a 2nd or future 1st with it if you can get someone to bite. Sell that the top 4 is a luxury pick with all of the most desired players in this draft. People want White and Gordon and they want them bad,  maybe you can get someone to pay handsomely for the chance at one of those two without taking you out of one of these top 8 picks."
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,Mister__Sparkle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"In your situation, I would be ecstatic to pick Gurley, Cooper and Gordon. But there's a chance Gordon will go at 3. I'd say if Gordon's there, draft him. If he's not, trade down and go for Agholor or Perriman."

I have a more immediate view, so I wouldn't want to struggle for even one year -- I want to compete now.   Could you trade the 1.02 and any of your three QBs? Package them up for contributors at two positions (e.g. an RB and a TE), perhaps? I'd be happy to trade that second pick (and Brady or Garcon) to someone who wants to move up, in exchange for, say, Travis Kelce (or Zach Ertz, or Coby Fleener) along with a clear RB starter in the 25-40 ADP range and their 3rd rounder. Find someone who wants to get younger, offer them the second pick, and go. You still have two top-5 picks, and you're in a position to challenge for a playoff spot immediately."
DynastyFF,3ctm4s,JDriley,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:47:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone else about 1 and 2 going Cooper and Gurley, but personally I think at 4 if you dont trade back for more picks, Id consider Yeldon over Gordon. Jags have a pretty young oline that could be starting together for the next 6 to 7 years and become very good. Yea they werent great last season, but thats the youth. Personally Id trade back to 6 and take Yeldon."

DynastyFF,3cta5l,chiefst,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I traded two 2017 1st's for Jordan Matthews a couple weeks ago, and I thought that was a pretty good price."
DynastyFF,3cta5l,Cavemansol,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"QB was out of the question, so I offered him Matthews and pick 1.12 for Sanders and Mark Ingram to solidify my RB starter situation.  Still waiting to pull the trigger.    He also offered Demaryius Thomas and Keenan Allen for Matthews and TY Hilton"
DynastyFF,3cta5l,chiefst,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:45:15 2015 UTC,The DT and Allen offer is interesting. TY and DT have similar outlooks in that DT will lose Peyton after this or next season and TY may not be resigned after this year. I like DT's talent more and think he has the better long term outlook. I'd probably accept that trade. Matthews and Allen are similar IMO.   I can see where you can use another RB in a league that starts 3 of them but I'm not sure Matthews and 1.12 nets you Sanders and Ingram. Worth a shot. I don't love Ingram but as a starting RB3 you could do a lot worse.
DynastyFF,3cta5l,chiefst,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input guys, that last bit helped (similar situations).  I ended up getting Ingram and DT for TY and Matthews.

DynastyFF,3cta5l,thefadd,3,Mon Jul 13 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"That's a really bad trade for you. I wouldn't put much money on Sanders doing any better than Matthews even this year, and long term Matthews is far more valuable."
DynastyFF,3cta5l,Theczarcasticone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:59 2015 UTC,Totally. I'm pretty sure some people have Matthews ahead of Sanders even in redraft this year.
DynastyFF,3cta5l,maddenite,2,Sat Jul 11 03:12:42 2015 UTC,"You have too may WRs to start. But that's a good thing. If I was you, I'd try to trade one or two for a good QB if it's a weak position for you."
DynastyFF,3cta5l,thefadd,2,Fri Jul 10 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"Even this year I dont think there is a huge difference in the amount of production that you will be getting from JMatt vs. Sanders.   Peyton struggled towards the end of the year while JMatt surged as the #2 option in a top offense. Now JMatt is the #1 option in a top offense and Peyton is 1 year older which means which hurts not only his value the value of his WRs in this case, Sanders.  You'll be able to get solid WR2 production from JMatt for this year and many more to follow since he is very very talented. And if you're afraid of his Qb situation, dont be, that offense will click regardless of Bradford or Sanchez being under center. Remember it was Sanchez who helped make JMatt relevant after Foles went down."
DynastyFF,3cta5l,Wetzilla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, Sanchize might actually be better for Matthews. He has tunnel vision for the guy. Bradford will likely spread the ball around much more."

DynastyFF,3ctajm,quickonthedrawl,3,Fri Jul 10 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"Julius Thomas is not a premium TE in Jacksonville, imo. Easily top 10 still, but not a huge upgrade over Green, given Gates' age and how much better SD offense is than Jax. I'd also balk at trading a top 4 rookie pick for AP at this point in his career. Easy decline for me, and I wouldn't be targeting either JT or AP honestly. You need to build for 1-3 years down the road to usurp HILYM, not wasting value to try to chase it this year."
DynastyFF,3ctajm,blardorg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with your overall point, but I would just add that I don't know that JT easily top 10. I think Gronk/Graham/Kelce seem to locked at the top spots. After that you have Gates/Green, Olsen, Bennet, and Donnell who are likely to be better and you still have other guys like Reed, ASJ, Cameron, Rudolph, Witten, Clay, and Walker who could be top 10. I wouldn't be shocked if Daniels (likely Denver TE) makes the top 10. I would put Thomas in that last group with guys like Cameron and Witten, but I wouldn't be shocked if he's just in the middle of that pack. I feel bad for guys who mortgaged for JT last year and especially this off season. Not to mention, Jags want to play smash mouth a bit, and you can't have JT on the line if that's the case as he is a huge liability when asked to block."
DynastyFF,3ctajm,aussiemac24,2,Fri Jul 10 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"How are you viewing Green to Thomas? Right now, I'd say Green>Thomas. If you're in win now mode then I'd just simplify the trade to be White for AP."
DynastyFF,3ctajm,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"i'm just curious, why are you so down on Julius Thomas?  I view the trade as essentially Green for AD (late 1st/early 2nd value) and White (1.03 in our league) for Thomas"
DynastyFF,3ctajm,Cavemansol,2,Fri Jul 10 17:07:02 2015 UTC,"JT isn't worth a 1st, let alone 1.03.  He's not even a lock for a top 10 TE year next year in Jacksonville."
DynastyFF,3ctajm,Ez13zie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"I'm down on him because he's never played a whole season and now has just a BB throwing to him instead of a Hall of Famer. IMHO, I'd be looking to deal Thomas away ASAP. I just don't see him producing as he has in the past. As for Green, though it does take a couple years to bring up TEs in the League, he's still essentially unproven. AD will give you 3 years tops but I'm betting that his production will provide more upside than Green vs a field of other TEs. Just my 2 cents!"
DynastyFF,3ctajm,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:28:24 2015 UTC,EZ and I share the same thought. I expect Green to have Gates level production (Which he's demonstrated in the past). Thomas will have slightly better production than Mercedes. Not having Peyton makes a BIG difference. Remember that Peyton has made the likes of Dallas Clark and Jacob Tamme fantasy relevant. He will do the same thing to Owen Daniels.
DynastyFF,3ctajm,Brandnewbaseboards,3,Fri Jul 10 18:03:44 2015 UTC,If you expect green to have gates (hall of fame) level production I think you're gonna be disappointed.
DynastyFF,3ctajm,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"You may be right, and I probably overstated that comparison. But I'd put more money on Green being closer to Gates (9.6 avg) than 2015 Thomas being closer to 2014 Thomas (10.1 avg) which is the question at hand. Different style offense, different quarterback, and different weapons overall I think really bring Thomas value down substantially."

I'm new to dynasty, but I have to imagine his value skyrockets during the season when trading to a win-now team, especially if that team has suffered an injury at the RB position. At that point, the contending team undervalues youth/picks and may be more willing to pay better value for JC."
DynastyFF,3cssfw,aussiemac24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"It amazes me how people undervalue proven RB vets in dynasty.    It shouldn't. Vet RBs are useful, even essential to winning a championship, but they are volatile and subject to increased chance of injury and more sudden decline in production. Would you rather have a young WR1/2 type who will produce for you team for up to 10 years or a guy who will produce RB1/2 numbers for 2 or 3? Because often time you'll be asked to make that choice for a vet RB. Teams will usually will have to punt their future by selling younger talent or picks for a player that might give them a better chance of a championship. And then even if they do it'll be difficult to sell that RB for what you paid next year when they're a year older and you realize you need youth.   Who would you trade for JC?"
DynastyFF,3cssfw,just_trizzy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"I'd agree RB1's can be volatile, but true top tier backs don't seem to be as volatile and JC hits that. Look at Arian Foster. I'd bet they would both be top 8 again this year along with AP. I'm not saying JC = Bell by any means. At least in my league, I'd be hard pressed to get a 1st rd pick for JC. I'd make that trade in a heartbeat. The odds of JC being top 10 at his position for the next 3 years are better than Gurley/Gordon IMO.   EDIT: I'd also add that RBs have a track record of being difficult to nail in the draft compared to WRs.

On mobile so I can't do a reply proper justice, but just a couple things that come to mind:   We definitely seem to be in a Golden Age of young talent, and WR talent in particular. After 2-3 bad draft classes in a row, the tactic might lose some or all of its luster. If you had gone all in on Marqise Lee, Bishop Sankey, Jace Amaro, etc... You might not be feeling so hot right now! Youth is king (IMO) but not all kings are made equally. Not a huge fan of the direct comparisons to past classes. I think it needs more nuance. For example I love young WRs but didn't touch Austin anywhere since he's 4 feet tall. It's not just rookies! Second and third year players are crucial to any draft, but particularly a punt. The rookies don't start popping in until round 2, and really more like rounds 4-5, so the highest leverage picks are all going to be established players. Young, but established.   Wish I had more to say here on the phone, but the discussion looks good already. love that you posted this though! There's a lot of food for thought."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,quickonthedrawl,4,Fri Jul 10 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: I think whether you plan for ""win later"" or ""win now"" or ""let's try to win now but have aces in the hole for later"" all depends on a couple key things:  1) How are other people drafting?  2) How much time do you have to dedicate to research?  To your point OP, playing the ""win later"" game doesn't help if you're just picking rookies without delving into their coaches, their schemes, their situations and how they look at OTAs/training/preseason games. QOTD has the interest, time and ability to go through and pick winners from a heap of fresh blood in the NFL, or at the very least he's well-versed and experienced enough to pick enough winners to make the strategy work. It's easier, in my opinion, to pick proven talent in proven situations early on to establish a floor for the first couple years and then pick some fliers later on than to try and fight and snatch and gamble on youth in the early rounds at the risk of your first year. If you can do the research to make your gambling odds tilt in your favor, sure, but it's still gambling and it can still blow up in your face.  But if you're in a draft with a bunch of people who also have time to do the research and also want to skip the first year for later success, you might as well pick up ""win now"" picks early when they fall beyond their value (or as alternatives when the valuable rookie/sophomore picks get snatched from you) and focus on later-round rookies and fliers. Just because you took Dez instead of OBJ or D. Thomas instead of Amari Cooper in rounds 1/2 doesn't mean you can't grab a Sammie Coates, Kenny Bell or Philip Dorsett in the later rounds - it just means your total pool of young blood is smaller.  There's also a bit of grey area that I think gets lost on people here. QOTD focuses on rookies and doesn't FOCUS on winning the first year, yes, but he's still picking up proven sophomores or others who still have some gas left in the tank. I don't think the conversation should be ""do I bother to win the first year or not"" rather than ""how much do I value age?""  And like you and QOTD said in your posts, this isn't just a decision for your draft but also how you trade, how you play the waiver wire and how your early draft choices affect your later draft choices.  Really though it's all a crapshoot and in all likelihood your rookies will get overshadowed by teammates and your veterans will get injured and you will lose every year, slowly and painfully."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,HerroCorumbia,3,Fri Jul 10 15:15:47 2015 UTC,I definitely agree this isn't the Nba its Fantasy Football.
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,bconbucks,3,Fri Jul 10 04:51:42 2015 UTC,"Very Very interesting perspective on this. Especially when you showed what the picks were in 2012 and 2013! I'm actually really surprised with some of those.  I usually try to go with BPA in my startups- Obviously not going for older guys, but not going into the startup going with a full on rebuild. So far, it has worked pretty well for me and I'm liking my teams. Now I just started a 2 QB draft that I wanted to test out youth. Here's how it looks as of now  QBs: Teddy Bridgewater, Derek Carr  RB:  Le'veon Bell, Ameer Abdullah  WR: Deandre Hopkins, JMatt, Breshad Perriman  It's the 8th round. SO far there's so much vet talent falling that I'm actually angry at myself  for going with youth...  The main point here  I think the best thing to do is go into the first 3-4 rounds and just snag Best prospect available. Don't sell yourself  to win now or win later and just see what happens. if everyone's going for vets and you're able to get Hopkins in the late 3rd and Jeremy Hill in the 4th, then be my guest to go young.  The whole tanking issue is also really hard to debate. You can tell some people are gonna have freebee weeks. Is that okay or not? that depends on the league imo"
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,onlymycouchpullsout,3,Fri Jul 10 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"SO far there's so much vet talent falling that I'm actually angry at myself for going with youth...

DynastyFF,3cqxnx,auggiedoggies,2,Fri Jul 10 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"Great points here. I've got a couple thoughts...   I dont like the term tanking because of the negative connotations that go along with it. I can appreciate your opinion on it, but I'd be much happier playing in leagues where GM's are self-aware of their teams chances of winning. In one of my leagues, every guy says ""if this and this and this and this happen, I'll be good.."" The best real life example I can come up with is the Chicago Cubs amassing massive amounts of prospects in recent years, setting up for future years of success (like a dynasty or something). I think the emphasis should less be on rookies and more on youth that's shown signs of ability in the NFL already when ""punting"" the draft. Let people gamble on rookies while you take more proven talent. Could people have Keenan Allen Year 2's? Of course, but it's less likely in my opinion.   Again, enjoyed the read though."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,akbfrosty,2,Fri Jul 10 02:19:11 2015 UTC,I have to say I'm very happy to see a good in-depth point-counterpoint here.   I really like your point about not confining yourself to this strategy because it can throw away a lot of potential value from the draft. You really don't know where you are going to find that value until your league drafts and dictates its.
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,umaro900,2,Fri Jul 10 05:54:42 2015 UTC,This is how you should draft draft for value not with a predetermined set of rules for yourself
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,bconbucks,2,Fri Jul 10 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"how much fun is it to field a terrible team in year 1, 2, etc.?   None, at all. In all of my startups last year, I built a win now team that would be good for 2 years. I figured if I could win a championship in one of them, I would have plenty of time to do a teardown and rebuild, but would be playing on house money instead of my own. I think I did 8 startups, playoffs in all, championship game in 4, and won 1. Most of these teams should still be competitive for me this year. If I'm wrong, I'll sell talent around the in season deadline for draft picks or youth to contenders.  This year I did 5 more startups, and I think in 2 of them I did draft young, but did not punt. I still took best available talent as long as they were young enough. The worry with a dynasty league is that it won't necessarily last, and it would suck to have a 3-5 year plan in a league that may not make it into year 2 (Hakuna Matata is one that comes to mind, dickhead commish hav0k)"
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,LamanamanumiReborn,2,Fri Jul 10 10:43:32 2015 UTC,"I like this argument way better than the previous one. True, if you punt you could get lucky with picks, but I'd rather overpay for a proven, young commodity than a bust draft pick. Plus, I think everyone is a bit oversold on age. There are still WRs who are effective to 35 yrs old and RBs beyond 30. If you can get a healthy proven vet that's 28 years old... enjoy 3-5 years of solid production! I'd take that over a 20% chance of a start worthy draft pick!"
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,aussiemac24,4,Fri Jul 10 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that this strategy requires a league that has lots of active owners and willing trade partners. This posts give a great counter that explains the downside to banking on young, unproven players.   What I do think is important to note is that punting year 1 and targeting young talent doesnt mean you're relying on those players to be mainstays on your roster. A savvy owner could have turned players like TRich, Floyd, CPatt, and Gordon into insane amounts of value if they flipped them at the right time. Just because these players are are lows right now doesn't mean that they were never worth anything."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,Dr_Lollygag,6,Fri Jul 10 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"You make a great point with flipping players.  It's pretty tough to predict the downfall of certain guys though. If you drafted these players, when they start preforming well why would you then trade them? Isn't the point of drafting rookie players to hold them and hope they become studs? Who are you going to sell them for? More picks... or different young players? Or do you completely change your strategy and go for vets?  Basically all I'm saying is they have a really small window to trade them in. Patterson's value literally plummeted last season... same with Richardson's and Gordon's."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,blardorg,5,Fri Jul 10 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, it isn't that tough at the extreme ends. I commented just above, but TRich and Doug Martin were top 5 dynasty start up guys in 2013. As in, their value essentially couldn't be any higher. If you agree that basically any player should be available for 3 or 4 first rounders, then that puts a price at which you should be willing to sell.   Is OBJ more likely than not to keep being a stud? Definitely. If someone offered me 3 or 4 firsts, though, of course I would sell. Worst case, I sold a stud WR for fair value. Best case, I sold a decent WR at their peak in value.   It's absolutely a tougher call for guys a little lower. Is Jordan Matthews a legit WR1 now that Maclin is gone? How the hell should I value Watkins given the changes in Buffalo? Are they trending up or down? But for guys getting drafted in the first round in start ups after a season or less, imo it makes a ton of sense to sell."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,Dr_Lollygag,3,Fri Jul 10 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely make it sound easier than it is. Selling those guys while they're valued so highly can be like parting from a loved one. Just another thought to consider with the year 1 punt idea. Obviously various strategies work for different owners, and I love these quality competing write ups!"
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,Ez13zie,2,Fri Jul 10 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"This is so true. I always use the term and say these owners were ""Blinded by the Liiiiight."" Simply put, I dealt Gordon away at the end of 2013 because I didn't see him ever performing better than that EVER. Regression is real and in his case, a bad situation couple with off the field problems helped me know when to deal him away. I actually feel bad for the guy. I don't smoke or anything, but I think it's absurd these guys can't use MJ to tone that pain down a bit. That's another topic though."

Just because these players are are lows right now doesn't mean that they were never worth anything.   This is a great point, and something to keep in mind when you're sitting on someone like OBJ. It is almost impossible to make a mistake selling someone if they're at what is almost the highest value possible.   2013 saw TRich and Doug Martin as top 5 dynasty assets; you could've gotten 3+ first rounders for either, which was a price that assumed they were proven, career high end RB1s. If you sold TRich for 4 firsts and he went on to be the next AP, it isn't like you lost much. Worst case, you got fair value for a stud."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,Dr_Lollygag,2,Fri Jul 10 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah obviously it isn't as simple as I made it sound, because owners frequently buy into their guys faster than anyone else, but its nice to consider."
DynastyFF,3cqxnx,Ansomnia,3,Fri Jul 10 02:36:40 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that this got posted. There's been a lot of quality material on this sub the last couple days!  I think the main point that everyone seems to be missing out on is that the person tanking isn't the only person who is being rewarded with draft picks. The ""win-now"" team is also gifted with  all of those picks as well, unless their team is crafted with their future assets to build their current team, but then it's how each individual values their future draft picks that comes into question.   Albeit their is a distinct talent discrepancy between the top and bottom of rookie draft boards when draft time comes rolling around the intrinsic value of each player varies so dramatically over the course of their rookie season.   Let's take last year's draft class as an example. The consensus states that this was one of the deepest classes across the board. While those who punted 2013 were gifted picks around 1.01-1.02 were given their choice of Watkins/Evans + whatever fell out of the 1st those of us who had 1.10-1.12 picks (while coming off a top 3 finish) were gifted OBJ/Hill/whatever else fell through the first while still having an opportunity at players like ARob and Moncrief coming back to us in the late 2nd. Add that talent to an already competitive team and you have a continued dynasty on your hands.  Flashback to prior years now. 2012 punters had their pick of the litter in Hopkins/Bell/Lacy/Bernard/Austin/Ball. Some hit, and some miserably fell flat on their faces. Meanwhile, competing teams had their chance to grab Allen/Patterson/and for the better part of a year Stacy while still having a chance at Ellington/Kelce/Charles Johnson in later rounds.  Ultimately, what /u/quickonthedrawl stated in his 3rd point on his response post in this thread rings loudest to me:    For example I love young WRs but didn't touch Austin anywhere since he's 4 feet tall.   A lot of us had the option to go Austin or Ball, but went with one of the other running backs instead (I personally got Bell!) based on personal scouting or sheer dumb luck.   When it boils down to it each individual owner is responsible for how well much time and effort they go into for preparing their teams. Do you know you're going to be a middling team, but really like this 6'5"" WR out of South Carolina? Well great! You just snagged Alshon Jeffrey! Don't believe the Hammy Hype? Awesome! You now have 1.01 in the majority of 2015 dynasty startups!  TL:DR Each drafting strategy has it's own silver linings, but ultimately it boils down to how well you as an owner scout your rookies and collaborate trades in the off-season"
DynastyFF,3ct0xj,JDriley,3,Fri Jul 10 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"I'd say your success is more dependent on whether any of your other WRs besides Dez perform. Even if Hyde is bad, he'll probably be a RB2."

DynastyFF,3csihl,lawofmurphy,2,Fri Jul 10 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"In lieu of a trophy, I do a Hall of Fame board. Basically...I like to celebrate the players who play a big role in the history of my league. So I set ground rules:   Players get voted in by a simple majority (the owner sits the vote out). Players are only eligible if they accrue 5+ years with one fantasy team. They don't have to be 5 consecutive years. Also, this means a player could theoretically go in twice if he had two 5-year runs of excellence with two different teams. Players get in based ONLY on their years with the team they are attached to. So...in my league, certain players spend...say...3 years on one roster playing HoF level football. But then they are traded to another team and finish out with 5 good, not great seasons. That player probably doesn't make our Hall of Fame.   Conversely, some players put together 5 elite years...think Tiki Barber or Maurice Jones-Drew. Those guys have no chance at the NFL HoF, but they make sense as HoF'ers in our league.  Anyway...the players who get in get a little jersey and their fantasy team's logo on it...it's all fairly cute and fun. And it's a little different/unique compared to the trophy.

So unless you're really in love with White or Gordon, it seems like a no-brainer to me.  Those ADPs are:  28 Gordon  29 White  34 Allen  36 Peterson"
DynastyFF,3cqw8i,slibaz,2,Fri Jul 10 13:19:43 2015 UTC,"So AD = AP???? This isn't a question for me. Your getting Keenan Allen at an absolute steal! You have to take this in my opinion. I wouldn't think twice about it.   EDIT: Reading the other comments, you still have to take this on value. Even if you aren't in win now mode, KA is a great young WR talent, and AP could be sold for 1st Rd/Rookie to a win now team in mid season."
DynastyFF,3cqw8i,aussiemac24,5,Fri Jul 10 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"Allen by himself is almost exactly the value of 1.03, so the rest is just gravy.  Even if AD doesn't hit the field you at least break even on this trade."
DynastyFF,3cqw8i,andyLDN,3,Fri Jul 10 01:41:14 2015 UTC,Don't agree at all. Would much rather Amari or White there
DynastyFF,3cqw8i,XanderMatrix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"Assuming amari isn't there,  white or Gordon are not going to be better options there than what he's receiving in return."
DynastyFF,3cqw8i,Sw33tch1nmusic,3,Fri Jul 10 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"Would not be doing this deal. 1.03 gets you Kevin White at the very least, and gives you the chance to have Cooper or Gurley fall into your lap. I personally am a believer in Keenan Allen, but don't think he has a ceiling near that of any of those 3 I mentioned. AD doesnt add as much to your team as he might to another, simply because you are lacking at WR, not as much at RB.   In my opinion, this team is not a contender, and a move like this that rids you of that delicious young talent a 1.03 is a bad move."

DynastyFF,3cqw8i,JDriley,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:57:30 2015 UTC,Do it. You have a great team. Just a little weak at WR. This trade gives you talent at WR and possibly what will be a top 5 RB this season. And you can probably move Tre Mason to the Gurley owner for another decent WR.
DynastyFF,3cqw8i,chiefst,0,Fri Jul 10 16:11:17 2015 UTC,I'd make this trade. AD is worth more then 1.03 straight up. Allen is a really sweet bonus. After this is done I'd sell on one of your many quality RB's for another young WR or two. Right now your RB corps is stacked and your WR's are ODB and a bunch of old farts.
DynastyFF,3cp298,mattycoop,3,Thu Jul 9 17:03:41 2015 UTC,I actually think it's a really cool idea....I might try this
DynastyFF,3cp298,auggiedoggies,2,Thu Jul 9 17:22:07 2015 UTC,I like the idea of scoring defense against your opponent. What about getting points from your opponent's player's opponents? That might make more sense than your own.  It's probably easier to implement than it sounds. Just explaining fantasy football to people sounds complicated. Figuring out the strategy might be more difficult but then that's the fun of it.  It needs more fleshing and testing but I think it could be worth it!
DynastyFF,3cp298,thefadd,3,Thu Jul 9 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, this could really add strategy. Of course you start your studs no matter what but say I've got to choose between Golden Tate Vs Houston and Davante Adams Vs Cleveland as a bye week fill-in. Typically, I'd want to go with Tate but I also wouldn't want to give my opponent the opportunity to pick up JJ Watt.  Initially this could take a lot of policing or some sort of process (lots of people's opponents may be Houston) and no sites are set up to do this yet but it could be a lot of fun and add some of the ""team"" aspect back into fantasy sports that people are always criticizing it for."
DynastyFF,3cp298,thefadd,2,Thu Jul 9 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was saying. Sorry if I wasn't clear.  You would pick from a pool of your FF opponent's player's opponents. So if your opponent has players on his squad that are playing HOU, SEA, CLE, NYG, PHI, GB. Then you can pick two teams from that list (HOU and SEA), and then you pick three defensive players from those 2 teams (Watt, Clowney, Sherman) to be scored against your opponent."
DynastyFF,3cp298,thefadd,2,Thu Jul 9 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm excited about the idea! The impediment I see is one dude has Jordan Matthews and another has Nelson Agholor. The Eagles are playing the Texans. How do you decide who gets to start Watt, Clowney, etc or could multiple people start the same defensive players? I could see defenders points reduced somewhat under the latter scenario."
DynastyFF,3cp298,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 9 23:37:00 2015 UTC,hmm.. didn't think of that.  I don't think that you would want the possibility of 2 teams playing the same defense against each other. So I think it should be unique teams only. So in your example the two teams couldn't play anyone on HOU.  I think that adds even more strategy. Maybe you don't play Jordan Matthews because you think someone on your bench can get you similar production. Switch him out and you unlock the HOU defense.
DynastyFF,3cp298,chkessle,2,Fri Jul 10 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm! Regardless of how else you do it, I really like how your defense takes points away from their offense. Even if the end result is the exact same, that's some very cool added flavor."
DynastyFF,3cpv05,DontEatTheCandle,3,Thu Jul 9 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"It's a very solid team. I would lean toward Cooper. He's a little safer, very very good, and your WR corps is strong but not invincible."
DynastyFF,3cpv05,quickonthedrawl,3,Thu Jul 9 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"I'd go WR.   You have a good RB core with a great 1-2, but I don't feel the same way about your WR situation. You have some guys labeled for a breakout season but I think you want to build towards the same kind of 1-2 you have at RB.  That being said, I think that you have a couple good options at WR.   Amari Cooper is slotted to be a #1 receiver. The rest of the Raiders are pretty bad though, so there's a question of how much is he going to get the ball.   Nelson Agholor is in a proven, high speed, high yards offense on a team thats thin at outside WR.   Kevin White may be worth a look as well with Brandon Marshall leaving town. Also, he has a new OC from Denver, and we all know how much Denver threw the ball.  I think those are your best choices in your given situation, man.   Good Luck."
DynastyFF,3cpv05,mattycoop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"Solid team with no real needs.   Honestly, if neither one of those guys strike you, try shopping the pick around.   There's usually one guy who's looking to overpay in the draft, see what offers you can get."
DynastyFF,3cpv05,MrCarlosDanger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"First off, your team is friggin RIDONKULOUS. I don't know how you landed the first pick (surely you didn't finish last in 2014!) but kudos to you!   I really like the idea of shopping the pick to see if you might get someone desperate enough to give you two or three picks with a tier 2 or 3 player you're interested in. I see a lot of people taking Gurley in your situation and you could always take him and deal him away (I'm skeptical of his durability)."
DynastyFF,3cpv05,Ez13zie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"RB. Either Gordon or Gurley depending on who you like more. Both your big name starters got their gigs last year because someone else got hurt. Granted that is how opportunity comes, but their sample sizes are very small, Hill is reportedly going to be in a committee with Bernard, and who knows how they'll use Hillman and Ball in Denver next year. I fell like Gordon is the safest RB to take but yeah, cooper could be great and you could always trade him or another WR for positions you need more. Just my opinion of course."
DynastyFF,3cpv05,Hawxfan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"Your team is very good, but could struggle a bit with an injury at RB or if none of Allen/Robinson/Smith trio emerge as a WR2 for you.  I think one of those three puts up WR2 value and based on the number of injuries we've seen in the last two years at RB picking either Gordon or Gurley gives you a slightly better chance to win in 2015. At the same time, everyone knows WRs pay off longer in dynasty so you'd be sacrificing some long term value for short term insurance."

DynastyFF,3cqa62,Sticky_Z,2,Sat Jul 11 04:26:53 2015 UTC,"This is a common question and comes with its own questions. Do you mean fun like adding taxis, deep lineups, kick/punt return yards, ppc or whacky shit like mandatory 3qbs, crazy bonuses, team positions, points per completion, intense int negative points, weird playoff / weekly schedules (like triple headers)"
DynastyFF,3cqa62,Sticky_Z,2,Thu Jul 9 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"The first part. We've been thinking about adding return yard points and taxis but not sure how to go about it.  Is a point for every 25 return yards a good idea? We're on ESPN, so the only options for yardage numbers are 1, 10, or 25.  As for taxi squads, do you have any experience with them? How did it go?  And if PPC means points per completion, then that sounds interesting. What's a typical scoring setup for that?  Sorry to ask so many questions, but I see your name around here a lot and you seem to know your shit, so I figured I'd pick your brain a little bit. Thanks!"
DynastyFF,3cqa62,Sticky_Z,3,Thu Jul 9 23:29:21 2015 UTC,"Return yards look good, i think .05 per yard works out to about 1 pt for a 20 yard return, thats pretty standard for a kickoff return right? 25 is good too :)  Taxi's can be a pain in the ass unless you give them a real mechanic. In most cases you can just add more roster space. Some leagues allow for taxi sniping. This is basically a process where another owner can steal your taxi player and pay you in rookie pick compensation (usually the round they were taken or a round better) or you can active them (thereby loosing a roster player unless you have the space) I think thats really the best way to use them. Why not just add roster space otherwise right?  PPC means Point Per Carry, so an RB get a point every carry....1 full point is kind of insane but like .3 or half a point can give RB's a big boost for dynasty. Points per completion is cool also and a normal amount is prolly close to .1 but you could add more to get cray.  Hope that helps"
DynastyFF,3cqa62,Sticky_Z,2,Thu Jul 9 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"It definitely helped. I think we're gonna add in points for return yards, carries, and completions. But taxi squads might be a little pointless. Thanks for all the feedback!  One more quick question, what do you believe is the best scoring setup for IDPs? Categories are sacks, tackles, blocked PAT/FG/Punt, INT, fumble recovery, forced fumble, safety, stuff, passes defensed. I don't have a ton of experience with IDPs and I'm looking for a scoring setup that will value defensive players enough."
DynastyFF,3cqa62,Sticky_Z,2,Fri Jul 10 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"o gosh, putting me on the spot. I always do the same thing when someone asks me, if you want really balanced across the position and tackle heavy (the way I like it) follow these from /u/barles   If you want a little less balanced positionally but more big play dependent take a  look at these  I like tackle heavy because its a bit more reliable and more true to the game in my opinion."
DynastyFF,3cqa62,HighMakkaMakka,2,Fri Jul 10 00:10:18 2015 UTC,"Haha sorry man didn't mean to put you on the spot. You seem to know your shit and I think it's pretty clear that I don't.

DynastyFF,3cqa62,cyclone369,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! Glad I could help, tip your waitress! Yeah IDP scoring is all about league preference and tweaking to your needs. I hope you are using MFL because you can do positional scoring and really keep have full customization."
DynastyFF,3cpr1g,mogotti5006,6,Thu Jul 9 20:06:10 2015 UTC,Matt Waldmans's RSP. It's an entire book of scouting each year.    It's gonna cost ya money but not much.     If you're looking for guys that deep you probably enjoy scouting or are in a very serious league.   Either way worth it.
DynastyFF,3cpr1g,MrCarlosDanger,2,Thu Jul 9 20:30:40 2015 UTC,Take shots? Look for guys that are behind older players or players with injury histories. Then look for guys with expiring contracts. Gotta take as many lottery tickets that your roster space will allow.
DynastyFF,3cpqid,jssports12,3,Thu Jul 9 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"The thing about an auction draft is that it actually can take a really long time and sometimes thats a good thing. If you do a 24 hour clock that resets with each bid, its seems pretty feasible that if someone can get on to make a pick in a snake draft, they can login once a day and throw some bids out there.  A way to speed it up...hmm thats a tough one. You could do an auction for high level players (say a full starting lineup amount) then do a snake vet draft right after for depth. Adding in rookies to either the auction or the snake draft could make it easier or harder depending on preference. We had an auction that had each rookie pick in the draft not the players. Another option is have ""draft slots"" in the auction, so someone could draft slot 1 and pick from that slot in the vet/rookie.....soooooo many variations, not sure all your constraints."
DynastyFF,3cpqid,Sticky_Z,3,Thu Jul 9 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"Do a drauction. Auction for all the first 20 roster spots everyone cares about then snake draft the rest. The draft starts with whoever has the most money left over from the auction and so on. Never miss a chance to do auction as far as I'm concerned.  I will add that if you're talking email auction vs email draft, there's not a significant time difference. Typically in an email auction guys can nominate four players (or more in later rounds if you choose) whereas in an email draft there can be hours between picks if one person isn't paying attention. An email auction requires very little attention imho but the last rounds can be a little hellish when you have only a dollar per player.  If you're doing it live, awesome! and the last rounds of an auction will essentially only be a draft anyway."
DynastyFF,3cpqid,thefadd,2,Fri Jul 10 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"This. With an auction draft you can have bids on 4 players at once. It isn't too slow that way.  I love auctions but I'd have no problem at all switching to a free agent auction or a snake draft after 15 or 20 roster spots are filled.   Another thing you can do is suspend bidding overnight. So the commish pauses the draft for 10 hours or so while everyone sleeps and stuff. That way you can set the auction timer to a shorter time, like 8 or 10 hours, maybe even shorter."
DynastyFF,3cpqid,chkessle,0,Fri Jul 10 12:07:52 2015 UTC,Of course a snake draft is fair lol. It's just as fair if not more fair than auction drafts imo. Everyone has the same opportunity basically.

DynastyFF,3cpqid,LincolnSteve,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:28:46 2015 UTC,That should definitely be the case in a 12 team 2 QB league. In an odd way the ability to start two QBs may even things out some. The first two rounds should be dominated by QB picks with the teams at the back end having the chance to secure two top tier QBs and the teams in the front only having one.
DynastyFF,3cpqid,adrianp07,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:27:47 2015 UTC,"its more fair as far as balance. No one is going to go too star heavy sacrificing depth, or too rookie heavy and so on.

DynastyFF,3cpqid,chkessle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:45:04 2015 UTC,"How in the hell do you figure that a guy drafting 12th has ""the same opportunity"" as the guy drafting first?  You'd have to pick from the players everyone else didn't want."

Averagenit out and see what you get.... Genius
DynastyFF,3cpn7t,zwat28,2,Thu Jul 9 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"In 1 PPR, you need a lot more firepower at WR. Cooks should be a top 20 WR, Maclin probably in the mid to late 20s, while the remaining five will be somewhere from late 20s to 40s. You're lacking a high end top 5 WR1 and a high end top 15 WR2. That hurts quite a bit in 1 PPR. It's too late now, but you should be aggressive in the coming months with trading for a high end WR.  Otherwise, I think you're in decent shape. CJ Anderson and Yeldon should be a quality RB1 and RB2, though you should probably draft Ball and maybe Denard Robinson to have some safety there. Ivory will be fine as a RB3/backup, but you could also grab Ridley or Powell or Zac Stacy if you're worried. Like at WR, you're lacking a really high end RB1, though Anderson at least has the potential to finish there (whereas I'd argue none of your WRs have much of a chance of cracking the top 10).  Gronk at TE means you're set there :)  You need to be thinking about a backup for Brees, or even someone that you could use as your starter next year if Brees keeps declining and/or the Saints go more run heavy."

DynastyFF,3cq3lw,adrianp07,2,Thu Jul 9 21:37:05 2015 UTC,Check out the wiki in the sidebar for some stuff on the differences. Personally I agree with your assessment. Auction is a lot better for advanced owners. Snake just feels a lot better for new players. Snake kind of holds their hands a bit and makes adp the most valuable resource. Auction can be almost a free for all.

You don't have a bad team, but in an 8 man your team is in no position to compete now.  You've already got some project QBs like Carr and Bortles and that could be paired with a relatively young RB corps.  Kelce is gonna breakout soon, You already have TY Hilton.

DynastyFF,3cousf,quickonthedrawl,5,Thu Jul 9 18:33:20 2015 UTC,Trade 1 is the superior value.  AP is great and will continue to be so but you gain two desirable RBs and a first. You aren't going to compete this yr in my opinion.
DynastyFF,3cousf,dudhunter,2,Thu Jul 9 16:13:12 2015 UTC,Ball isn't really that desirable.
DynastyFF,3cousf,Wetzilla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but definitely buying very low on him given its gurley and another 1st. would you rather it be Sankey?"
DynastyFF,3cousf,jdr393,3,Thu Jul 9 18:12:28 2015 UTC,If you could get Sankey - I would do that. He actually had a pretty solid rookie year. Had higher YPC than Leveon Bell his rookie year...PFF had him rated pretty decently too. Not sure that Cobb is any real competition (5th round pick - Sankey was a 2nd round pick).  That said - I would do it without Sankey. Gurley and a first would be enough for me.
DynastyFF,3cousf,Wetzilla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably. I don't really like either, but Sankey at least has the starting job for now."
DynastyFF,3cousf,blardorg,4,Thu Jul 9 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"Even though you're in a position to try to compete now, I think trade A has too much value in a 16 team league for you to turn down. The 1.01 and a good 2016 1st is too much to turn down for a 30 year old RB, imo. Gurley is a ready made replacement for AP; I doubt he'll come that close to reaching AP's level, of course, but he should be a solid top 20 RB, with maaany more years left than AP. That 2016 1st will allow you to fill another hole on your team: top rookie QB, top tier WR or RB, whatever. I think this won't hurt you too much in the short term, but is a hugely beneficial trade in the long term."
DynastyFF,3cousf,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 9 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"Trade 1: I think this is the better offer. I would take this if you get to keep McKinnon. You're very thin at RB and I don't trust Coleman to have that job outright. You're getting the 1.02 (Gurley) and potentially a top pick next year.  Trade 2: I have no faith in Cruz. Patella tendon injuries are not like ACLs, there is no such thing as full recovery from that. Plus, there is this guy named OBJ who is the WR1 there now. Gio is a downward trend, but has some PPR value. The picks are intriguing, but not as much if you think they are 1.14+"
DynastyFF,3cousf,Sticky_Z,3,Thu Jul 9 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"I think with your team, I would keep AP, but if you are dead set on moving him. Trade A is pretty fucking amazing"
DynastyFF,3cousf,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"As in with my team, keep him and try to compete? I won with this core back-to-back 2 & 3 years ago. Last year with AP out, i made playoffs, but i don't have a sure second RB to pair him with this year (unless tevin coleman breaks out). I just don't think i'll get value for AP after this season."
DynastyFF,3cousf,Sticky_Z,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Well you arent in my league so how would i know that! (har har) Yeah  if you think you are ready to put him out to pasture then go for it! Thats a SOLID haul and you are 100% right you wont get nearly as much next year. I do think that if you are going to not compete, blow that mother f'er up"
DynastyFF,3cousf,plap11,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:50:44 2015 UTC,So.. I tried to get too much and he got second thoughts. Would AP and Mckinnon for Gurley and a projected top 3 First round next year be something you'd still do?
DynastyFF,3cousf,OP85,2,Wed Jul 15 15:34:41 2015 UTC,If you are ready to rebuild/have a replacement for Gurley for the first few weeks. Otherwise you might not win without AP. Its a good deal tho for me.

DynastyFF,3cousf,teschmj22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:24:28 2015 UTC,Im not entirely familiar with 16+ leagues but i feel you are a playoff contender but not much more. You really have no RB2 unless coleman can take over but i dont think thats likely and hes in a pass first offense. So really your taking close to a goose egg every week at the spot. I think its about time you start flipping your studs for some youth.   Take trade A.   I would also look into selling Thomas for some good value. Probably try a sell Manning/Jackson/Olsen as well while they still have a some value left.

DynastyFF,3cneh1,quickonthedrawl,7,Thu Jul 9 06:46:46 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to bring myself to all out punt on a draft. And really went all in in my latest draft, trading next years picks to get a squad that can probably compete for the next 3-4 years before they fall off too much. I wanted to draft lots of youth, but when people draft youth too early, I feel like you have to take value and it can force your hand. For example Cooper and Gurley went 14 and 15...I guess I'll take T.Y. in the mid 3rd then since everyone else is taking guys 2 years younger than him."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,akbfrosty,3,Thu Jul 9 13:03:21 2015 UTC,"The thing is every team can't punt in a draft (at least I don't see how it would be possible). At some point, like you mentioned, the value of slightly older players like TY Hilton is just to high not to pass them up. Does it mean your team is any less viable in the future? Maybe, but if 7 teams in your league are trying to punt year 1 only 1 or 2 might be successful at it. Just take the value and build a balanced, young-ish team."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,username02,5,Thu Jul 9 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have the answer to this one, but I do know that there's a max number of year 1 punters that a draft can sustain. At a certain point, you're absolutely right, you need to be willing to audible into a more competitive year 1 team. That's part of why my favorite picks early are guys like Evans, Watkins, Hopkins, et al since they keep your options open as long as possible.   If you start your draft off with Demaryius Thomas into Jordy Nelson, you won't have that same luxury in round 4 or 5 to adjust on the fly."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,akbfrosty,2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"100% agree, thought I was gonna go young with Cobb and Hopkins or Watkins...then Megatron fell to the 2nd round and I couldn't not take my hometown guy.   And to me the key is willing to be flexible in your draft strategy. I know it's dangerous, but I have always liked to let other people in the draft influence my drafting a great deal.  Also, love your write ups so far."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,Colonel_Buendia,6,Thu Jul 9 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"I actually think there's a balance here than can be achieved, and tend to think that this sub overvalues lottery pick rookies when the true value is in proven players in their prime. I started up in 2013 (ppr) and drafted Megatron and Forte as my first two picks. I also ended up with Tom Brady, Reggie Bush, Knowshown Moreno, and Reggie Wayne. I was ready to compete in 2013 but still had Russell, Gronk, JThomas, Gordon, Terrance Williams, Percy, Crabtree, and Michael Floyd as guys to build around going forward. Fast forward through several trades (Gordon, Wayne, Knowshon for Julio; picks, free agent cash, Joique Bell, and Terrance Williams for Demarco), some waiver wire pickups (CJ Spiller, Crowell) and a couple of drafts (Matthews, D. Freeman, Kevin White, David Johnson) and my team is solidly in its prime with a lot of ascending youth, and I haven't had to ""punt"" any years yet. Forte / Megatron are my only ""old"" players at this point, and I still have plenty of time to sell them for younger assets while staying competitive. I have always preferred the ""elite"" over ""volume"" strategy as well, so I would much rather trade mediocre assets to move up for Kevin White than take 2 lottery pick talents later on."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,blardorg,3,Thu Jul 9 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of good stuff here. You're right, it's not all about volume, you need your prospects to develop into studs also.  Like you, I have a startup team from last year in which I didn't punt, and that team did very well. It's deep from top to bottom and still competitive, but I had to hustle to turn some of my more shortsighted draft picks into long term values. You had to do the same with your team or you wouldn't be where you are right now! Those trades for Julio and Murray look insane right now, not to mention Spiller/Crowell-type guys are almost never on the waiver wire in most competitive leagues.   my team is solidly in its prime with a lot of ascending youth, and I haven't had to ""punt"" any years yet   That's awesome! It's definitely not the only winning strategy, it's simply the most effective strategy for my style of play. :)   I would much rather trade mediocre assets to move up for Kevin White than take 2 lottery pick talents later on.   This is almost always the case! The reason why I accumulate future 2nd round picks all year long isn't so I can draft a bunch of mediocre talent, it's so I can package them up to get back into the first round. But in a startup, you won't always have that luxury. Sometimes you can't trade back, can't trade up, and simply have to select a guy at most/every pick you got stuck with."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,blardorg,3,Thu Jul 9 14:05:12 2015 UTC,"To offer a bit of a counterpoint, assuming your criterion 1) holds, drafting pure BPA should be better (though of course, that assumes some consensus on player values). To make the point with a relatively outlandish example, say you're at the end of round 1 and every top tier young WR you like was picked. Would you really pass up someone like Julio or Dez for someone like Allen Robinson?   At some point, player value should trump your drafting strategy. If Graham or Jamaal Charles fell from their 1st round ADP to your 2nd or 3rd round pick last year (where I guess you took Watkins and Hopkins?), you would've set yourself up even better long term to take one of them and then trade them, right? You very likely could've gotten Watkins or Evans plus Robinson or Moncrief or Matthews for someone like Graham, especially since the common wisdom was that rookie WRs weren't going to explode right out of the gates (not so much anymore, ha!).   In that sense, I 100% agree with you about punting first year... but that doesn't mean punting the first year during the draft! The best way to set yourself up for the future is to draft the maximum amount of value possible, then shift it around into the kinds of assets you want with trades during/after the draft."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,Sticky_Z,4,Thu Jul 9 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"Good stuff dude. Lots of thought provoking things here.

To make the point with a relatively outlandish example, say you're at the end of round 1 and every top tier young WR you like was picked. Would you really pass up someone like Julio or Dez for someone like Allen Robinson?    Julio and Dez are both better than Robinson, even for a year 1 punt! Or take Demaryius Thomas for example. I would loathe drafting him at 1.12, but if he were (somehow) still there at 2.12, there's no chance I'd take Robinson over him. World of difference between the 26/27 year old studs like Dez and the 29/30 year old guys like Jordy or Calvin.  I like Robinson at 3.01 better than I like Dez at 1.01, but comparing the two to each other straight up is a pretty no brainer.   At some point, player value should trump your drafting strategy. If Graham or Jamaal Charles fell from their 1st round ADP to your 2nd or 3rd round pick last year (where I guess you took Watkins and Hopkins?), you would've set yourself up even better long term to take one of them and then trade them, right?   Not necessarily. It depends what you're passing these guys up for, IMO. Let's use a current example and say Eddie Lacy (ADP of 13 and often a first round pick) is sitting on the board at 2.08. The following players would all have to be gone before I'd feel great drafting him: Matthews, Cooks, Cooper, Hopkins, Watkins, Robinson. Otherwise, even if Lacy has ""more value"" than those guys and is technically the best player available, such a huge part of that value is locked up in 2015. A team drafting Eddie Lacy IMO has two (and only two) options:   Compete in 2015, or Shop Eddie Lacy   If neither case is true, then taking Lacy over those receivers is a mistake. Odds are pretty good to me that his ADP will fall below some or all of those guys within the next season or two. But to use an extreme example, if Lacy were somehow available in the 5th (or an arbitrarily low) round, it would be stupid to pass on him!  Selecting him specifically to trade is also a little dangerous. If he fell in the draft, that means multiple GMs passed on him. It means multiple GMs either didn't or couldn't trade up to get him. The counterpoint to this is that if he starts his season off on a very good stretch, it might become extraordinarily easy to flip him for good value, even if you couldn't do so post draft."

The counterpoint to this is that if he starts his season off on a very good stretch, it might become extraordinarily easy to flip him for good value, even if you couldn't do so post draft.   This is a fantastic point, and one I did not appreciate before posting. The only hedge I would make is that people might have passed on a particular player because they had their own idiosyncratic drafting strategy: ""I will take two WRs in the first two rounds, regardless of who is available,"" or ""I took Luck/Gronk in the 1st, so I had to take a WR in the 2nd or all the good ones would be gone,"" etc. A player falling doesn't necessarily mean no one values them around their consensus ADP. But I think you're totally right, that paying attention to the particular valuations/strategies of other GMs in your league is critical.  Anecdotally, I will say that drafting BPA can work out just as well. I drafted Lacy at 1.11 in a league, planning to take a young WR at 2.02 and build for the future, but the guy at the turn took Jeffery and Watkins. This was before AJ had left Houston, so Hopkins was a bit of a reach there, and Cobb hadn't re-signed in Green Bay yet, so he was as well. So I took Graham, still in New Orleans, and proceeded to take BPA as much as possible. I sold hard after the draft, and now have a core of Melvin Gordon/Mike Evans/Amari Cooper/Davante Adams/DGB/Dorsett/Eifert/Ertz, to go along with five 2016 1st round picks and four 2016 2nd round picks :D Should be fun!"
DynastyFF,3cneh1,auggiedoggies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"I did the second /r/DynastyFF pay league draft in a similar way and I sort of regret it. By going really hard in youth players im locking out trading for the most part. I'm not going to give away my youth now for older players just to maybe flip them for more youth. Maybe im not articulating it correctly but If I just drafted a mixed team and THEN moved all my older players for younger guys on win now squads I think I would have made out better in the long run. I'm sort of pigeonholed by not taking a single vet at RB and getting really young everywhere else, no one is really willing to give picks for young/inexperienced players. Where if I happened to not pass up an Ingram for example, if he blows up maybe I could get a better ROI than just skipping him for Duke Johnson (just an example)   Youll have to let me know if I get around to posting the results ha"
DynastyFF,3cneh1,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"Haven't played in Dynasty but find it intriguing. Genuinely curious why you're down on Lacy over a group of young but not truly elite receivers? Lacy's only 25, in his third season and playing on one of the best offenses in football and doesn't have a real history with injuries.   I get why young truly elite receivers would go ahead of him but just not sure about any of those guys you mentioned."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,blardorg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"Eddie Lacy is a little polarizing.  He's definitely talented, but not the most talented back in the game. He's in one of the best situations though, and has produced highly in each of his first two seasons.   doesn't have a real history with injuries.    Depends on what kind of time frame you're looking at. No injuries at the NFL level, but there were huge concerns about his toe going into the draft. He had some kind of procedure done where his toe was fused together, and that's why he fell past 3 (?) other RBs in the draft.  If I were building a ""win now"" team in a startup, I wouldn't be quite so scared off by Lacy (since it's not like you draft RBs to play for you for a decade anyway). But given my overall strategic tendencies it makes a ton of sense just to stay away entirely."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,auggiedoggies,3,Fri Jul 10 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"My only question, is what happens when the young guys don't work out?   It's a fact, this past year's draft class was an extreme anomaly. It was the greatest WR draft class of all time. History is littered with young guys who end up busting that looked to have enormous talent, and some even displayed it for a year before turning out to just be a flash in the pan.  What happens when these young guys end up not being the answer?"

Alfred and Ben have the same ADP, but Alfred is 21 and Ben is 30.  Both players blow out their knees in week 1 of 2015. Both players come back in 2016. Which one will be more valuable?  Both players struggle in 2015. Which one will be more valuable in 2016?  A perfect current example of both is Brandon Marshall and Keenan Allen. Both players were late 1st/early 2nd startup picks last season. Both players finished 2014 with ~750 yards. Both dropped in value, but now Keenan Allen is still a 3rd round pick. Marshall is a 5th or 6th rounder!  Even complete busts hold their value surprisingly well. Maybe it's because I'm a masochist, but I just traded for Stephen Hill during a rookie draft this week. Stephen Hill! But guys like him, or Justin Hunter, or Josh Gordon, or whatever... their value stays somewhat afloat as long as they're still young."

After Round 10 I still drafted some young guys mixed in like Devin Smith, Maxx Williams, Crowder, Waller but also grabbed Vincent Jackson, Allen, Josh Hill, Ellington, Quick, and Toon."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,ZeroCool79,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:37:30 2015 UTC,"Well the most important thing is to have the base of your team be young and talented. The problem with guys like Vincent Jackson, and Co. (as I'm sure you've learned already or will learn) is that they're almost entirely impossible to trade.  You'll get some starts out of them, but at some point, they'll be too good to drop but not good enough to start anymore. It gets a little obnoxious to manage.   That said, guys like Hill, Quick, Allen and even Ellington or Toon aren't too old to draft with this strategy as long as the price is right."
DynastyFF,3cneh1,justinkimball,2,Thu Jul 9 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the write-up, but I have a few problems with this in practice.   First, you are almost always going to be paying a premium to sell from a position you are very strong at to buy at one you are very weak at. The other person in the trade knows that you need to get that guy in order to be competitive. Yes, competition can drive down prices, but those teams who would be selling to you should know that by giving you that final piece of your roster they are decreasing their chances of winning in some way.  The longevity of the league is going to be correlated with the value of youth in the startup draft. Of course there are many measures that can and should be taken to ensure the league continues to exist. In leagues where everybody is taking the young prospects instead of the proven veterans, you can expect your league to be around (since everybody else does), but the competitive advantage is gone there. Conversely, many leagues with first-time dynasty players may be stargazing and, either through a poor understanding of the commitment that dynasty is or lack of faith in the league, some managers may leave the league with depleted teams that can cause the league to fold.    I think it's important to note that this is a viable strategy, though, in some leagues. It's important to be adaptive. By the time you would consider players like Gore, Nelson, and Andre, there should be at least a few rounds of information telling you how your league is drafting. If the first three rounds of your startup are all rookies (hyperbole), it's probably a good idea to pick up those players in the 8th or 9th round."

DynastyFF,3cneh1,TotesMessenger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"Well, when I say a premium, I mean that they gain some leverage knowing that you need to trade to be competitive and that by holding onto those extra WRs you aren't gaining anything. I don't mean that you will get the entire league stone-walling you. You can still probably get roughly fair deals done, but it's much harder to get good deals done.

You're positioned well for the present and future, but trading Davis and a pick for a win-now RB (AD?) would really solidify your current championship chances while keeping your future core intact."

DynastyFF,3cnqzc,Cavemansol,4,Thu Jul 9 09:52:08 2015 UTC,I always thought the prevailing wisdom was that Adams = Jordy and he dosent really affect Cobb from a positional standpoint.
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:42:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that Adams is more a replacement for Jordy than Cobb, but if Green Bay sees they have another top tier option at the ready, I think signing a then 29 year old slot receiver (whos really fucking good mind you) becomes less important.  Cobbs contract takes him to 29 years old, and I just don't know if hes the kind of receiver thats going to be great into his 30s...tough to tell.  Either way, up UNTIL that point, I think hes pretty much a lock for top 15 WR numbers."
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,Cavemansol,2,Thu Jul 9 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"I think Cobb is in a better situation but in dynasty I'll bet on DT's talent. Whether he stays with the Broncos and Brock Osweiler or whoever else or if DT goes to another team as a free agent, I think he will produce.   I for one think that last year might have been Cobb's peak. Last year he was catching a touchdown a game in the beginning of the season and then towards the end he fell off. He saved face with 2 TDs in Week 17 but didn't score from week 11-16.   I think Cobb will hold PPR value but will not catch as many TDs. I think DT is a top 5 dynasty receiver and he will be able to produce no matter who's throwing to him."
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,Santidreet,2,Thu Jul 9 10:15:59 2015 UTC,"Not only do I think DT is going to survive Mannings exit (whenever that is), I think Ossweiler will be a great option as a stash candidate because of DT.  I'm getting him in as many leagues as I can at seasons end."
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,ichyknee,2,Thu Jul 9 13:36:25 2015 UTC,Not at all. I'm with you. DT is a huge red flag for me with Manning leaving. Cobb is still quite young.
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,PT_Ben,2,Thu Jul 9 12:43:21 2015 UTC,"For those who believe in DT, next year is the time to buy. He still demand a premium price. Next year it should fall off."
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,PT_Ben,2,Thu Jul 9 12:44:42 2015 UTC,"DT seems to be undervalued right now. I've seen him going in the early to mid second round! Even as hard as I go toward younger players, that kind of price is impossible to argue against.  I do like Cobb slightly more though, even though I'm sure he's more situational of a talent than Thomas is. But I bet DT outscores him by a fairly large amount in 2015."
DynastyFF,3cnqzc,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt mind having both of them on my roster (and I have them both in one dynasty league).  But to answer the question, I feel like it depends on how well the other Green Bay WR plays. If Cobb gets #2 coverage or slot coverage while Demaryius is facing #1 (like in 2013 and 2014) then Cobb would tend to be more valuable in the long run. If Jordy retires or can't play in the next year or two, Cobb starts getting the #1 guys. With equal coverage against them, I'll take the guy who's a 6'3"" and a YAC monster over the 5'10"" speedster.  Due to his YAC ability, DT88 is somewhat QB-proof and matchup-proof.  I know, I know...Cobb had more YAC than DT in 2014.  But again that was with Thomas getting #1 coverage every week and Cobb getting slot/#2 coverage every week.  That's a big difference in my evaluation.  Even though he be three years older, I'd rather have an unconditional WR1 for 4 years than a WR2/3 who posts a few WR1 weeks for 7 years."

DynastyFF,3corrf,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"Your roster should be good enough to compete. I bet there are ~2-3 teams that have significantly better chances though unless the talent is really spread out. Lacy, Murray, Gio, Hilton, and Matthews should be enough to keep you afloat this season.  Sanchez and McCown are freeloading on you. They don't deserve a roster spot in a 12-team league when you already have Brees and Carr. Even if you don't find a trade partner, they can both be safely dropped.  Do you know who you're going to take with your draft pick? Looks like you've only had one pick so far, and Ajayi is a solid guy to add, but your roster is starting to look a little old overall."
DynastyFF,3corrf,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"The team I lost to in the championship last year has a new owner and a VERY strong team. Just about all the other teams either have dominant WRs OR dominant RBs but at the expense of the other. I think my team is the most well-rounded, but with no game-changing players.  Sanchez and McCown are sitting on my roster simply because I have the space right now. They'll be cut as soon as I need the roster space. 1 guy is rolling without a QB right now so I may try to get a small return on them as they were both free. Honestly wouldn't be surprised to see that guy starting Geno this year though.  A few of the guys in the league are on here too so I won't say exactly who I am targeting, but there are 1 or 2 rbs I am hoping will fall to me.  Thanks for the feedback."
DynastyFF,3corrf,ZeroCool79,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"Looks like a pretty decent team, though i'd be looking to upgrade at TE mostly."
DynastyFF,3corrf,ZeroCool79,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:17:17 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Daniels and Ertz can perform well this year and that Ertz can become a  weekly startable TE come next season. I'm not willing to pay the premium for guys like Gronk and Graham when TE has a fairly minimal impact compared to other positions.
DynastyFF,3corrf,aussiemac24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a big Ertz fan, and I'm not saying pay the premium for Graham or Gronk. But...I might look to get a vet like Jason Witten or Delanie Walker who will likely come w/ a cheap price tag in dynasty but also have mid/low TE1 production this year."
DynastyFF,3cpkf5,LittleHelpForAFriend,3,Thu Jul 9 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"Given your WRs, it doesn't look like you're in a position to compete now, so I'd probably prefer to take a rookie and go for longer term value than Johnson. Funchess, Dorsett, and Strong could all be available there. If he keeps up how he was playing at the end of last year, Charles Johnson will be a solid low end WR2 or high end WR3, but I at least am not totally confident in his long term value."
DynastyFF,3cpkf5,blardorg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed.. That's a bloated WR corps there, with a top RB and a 2nd year QB, albeit a promising one. I'd take my chances with one of the rookies as well."
DynastyFF,3cpkf5,aussiemac24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"I really like Johnson but I don't think I would trade him for the 2.02 unless I was convinced he was the missing piece that would allow my team to compete.  I hope this doesn't come off as douchey, but unless you have some ungodly combination of RB's and TE's I don't think you have a legit shot at competing this season even if you are able to add Johnson."
DynastyFF,3cpkf5,mrpizzacoli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"I had to look a little deeper into this because at first i thought its a solid trade. I initially was thinking CJ has to have more value then the guys at 2.02. Well according to most rankings, hes right at that value. 1.12-2.03 range. But based on your WR corps I feel you have to keep your 2.02 and go with a rookie.   Although CJ is only in his second yr, hes already 26. He has talent and has a pretty easy opportunity to be the #1 guy. But the offense will always be focused around AP as long as hes there. Mike Wallace will take away a good chunk of what little targets may be there. based on Age, CJ is at the height of a WR's career and its going to be clouded by other factors, including a sophomore QB (hes good though but still has a lot to learn). So taking all those factors that he maybe not be able to really shine for another 1-2 years, that makes him 27-28 and now statically will be on a slow decline of whats already really an unproven career, just flashes of talent, and combine that with what you have for a WR corps, it just doesnt sound as good to have a guy for 3-5 yrs compared to a solid rookie who can offer you 5-10. because really with the talent at 2.02, the risk of them busting are about the same. Il take my risk with a younger player."
DynastyFF,3co5ud,vivalahendy,2,Thu Jul 9 12:46:13 2015 UTC,I really like your team.  It's young and has a lot of top talent.  This team should be able to compete for several years.

DynastyFF,3clnwh,lawofmurphy,3,Wed Jul 8 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is really cool. Thanks for posting it. A couple (very minor) things that might need discussion:   Fantasy Football is a game in which several players called managers (most often 12)   Citation? Do we know this is true? I think most so-called 'expert' leagues are 12 teams. But there are certainly a lot more casual leagues than expert leagues...and I think 10-teamers are just as popular if not more popular nation-wide. But maybe there are stats about this stuff?   either a draft or auction process   I would introduce the term ""snake draft"" throughout to separate it from the auction, which is still a draft as far as I know. It's a little confusing to me to call a snake draft a ""draft"" and an auction draft an ""auction""."
DynastyFF,3clnwh,Cavemansol,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it's important to note that there are different types of auctions that can occur and different types of drafts. AFAIK auctions are much less standardized, though pure snake drafts are most popular for redraft/startup and pure linear drafts are most popular for dynasty rookie/FA drafts. There still are other draft methods, particularly including hybrids of the linear and snake formats intended to provide more balance.   OK. Rereading what you wrote about snake drafts, I see what you are saying. For some definition and usage, auctions can be a subcategory of ""drafts"", but the term ""snake"" doesn't capture the entirety of this ""auction-less draft"" which I'm really referring to, and other terms like ""standard"" or ""turn-based"" which I could prefix there can be equally misleading IMO. The ""auction"" vs ""draft"" distinction/usage is somewhat widely used, though clearly not universally. Hopefully the future write-ups and discussions where I refer to these concepts it will be clear which I am talking about.  For the 12 team part, I just threw that out as an aside, but I've changed it to ""10 or 12"", since you're right - it's somewhat baseless and misleading to just say 12. Although I still don't have definitive stats to back it up, I feel very comfortable in assuming that most leagues fall into one of those two sizes.   Thanks for the comments. When I write things up, it's just as much for me to understand and refine my process as it is to share my ideas with the world, so the feedback is much appreciated. It's really nice to see that somebody is paying enough attention to the details to be able to provide meaningful criticism.  EDIT: I made a few changes to the parts where I talk about auctions vs drafts in order to help clarify my intention."

DynastyFF,3cmpi5,Dr_Lollygag,2,Thu Jul 9 02:58:58 2015 UTC,Not knowing the rest of his roster I think Getting 1 stud WR and 1 stud RB sets a franchise up nicely. Gordon is an elite talent and definitely worthy of the 3rd pick.
DynastyFF,3cmpi5,locukfan,3,Thu Jul 9 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"I guess it becomes an issue of whether or not we believe in Gordon. I for one would prefer to have Yeldon if given the choice, but I would prefer White to both."
DynastyFF,3cmpi5,Dr_Lollygag,2,Thu Jul 9 05:32:41 2015 UTC,I'm definitely more a fan off gordon over yeldon. And I'm thinking gordon over white because my running back situation is alittle older then I would like
DynastyFF,3cmpi5,doodwhersmycar,3,Thu Jul 9 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"But, and I don't know Bc it wasn't explicitly stated, if you are rebuilding you're likely not contending therefore what does an early drafted running back do for you except maybe add a win or two to your end of season bottom line when you don't have a prayer to win it all anyway? Granted he'll be there for when you are ready to contend but then again highly drafted running backs historically have a higher bust rate than highly drafted wr's. White is a building block for your future the way I see it, unless you aren't rebuilding at all. My .02"
DynastyFF,3cmpi5,mooustached_walrus,2,Thu Jul 9 15:30:52 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I'm a firm believer in drafting WR and trading for RB.  Even if both White and Gordon meet expectations, White's value will be greater"

DynastyFF,3cmpi5,locukfan,2,Thu Jul 9 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"I would trade Nelson for Cooper straight up, especially if you aren't likely to compete this year, so getting Allen Robinson for either the 2.02 or 3.02 would be a steal.  That being said, from your trading partner's perspective these are the kind of deals you have to make sometimes to win it all. If he insists on getting 2.02, see if he'll kick in a pick next year."
DynastyFF,3cmpi5,Blacky31,2,Thu Jul 9 03:06:01 2015 UTC,Definitely do this deal. Possibly the best offer your ever gonna get for Nelson. And sitting at 2 And 3 you get two of the four top tier rookies.

Robinson showed he can produce before wearing down in the latter half of the season. He'll survive and work better as a complimentary piece.  I like Reed and in times he's shined, but he's made of glass, and even this offseason is recovering from yet another procedure. Niles Paul has already superseded him coming into training camp, and I'm not a believer in RGIII. Ebron may not be gold yet, but I think the chances for improvement this year are more in his corner than Reed's."
DynastyFF,3cll7h,bastegod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"I think I would look for someone with more upside. With the addition of TJ Yeldon, Robinson has become more of a backup or gadget player on a subpar offense."

Shoelace isn't a good option but maybe you can get something out of him.   I might hold onto Reed and hope he can put up a TE1 week and sell high (slightly higher than Shoelace anyway).
DynastyFF,3clkmn,pburns1587,3,Wed Jul 8 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"Love questions like this... You're picking guys before you know where they'll land, how much they'll cost, and before you get any combine info. Less info = less value.  Let's look at some recent movers so we have an idea of the variance you're looking at:   Nelson Agholor moved up half a round and Jaelen Strong moved down half a round in ADP based on what happened at the NFL Draft. Breshad Perriman moved up at least one round based purely on what he did at his Pro Day. Kevin White moved up a little more than half a round based on post season news including combine, draft, and additional analysis.   Guys like Chris Conley and Jay Ajayi also had significant movement. And this is all after they left college. You're still drafting guys in college. Now, Gurley, Gordon, Cooper, and a handful of lesser dudes have not significantly moved. Gurley, in fact, has been a major prospect that not suspension, nor injury, nor freezing rain and dark of night could convince people to back away from.  So there isn't total chaos. But there's significant room for better GM's to take advantage. It looks to me like your draft pics are worth about half a round less compared to other draft pics but I might go so far as to devalue draft pics in your league by as much as a full round when trading them for established NFL players. My main reasoning behind this is that I would bet on myself personally to be able to find some Whites and Perrimans out of the second or third round of your draft."
DynastyFF,3clkmn,thefadd,2,Thu Jul 9 02:09:52 2015 UTC,"I think a round sounds about right, especially because i put an emphasis on getting extra college picks. I've figured if there's going to be that much uncertainty, I should maximize my chances at hitting a late bloomer or avoiding busts."

DynastyFF,3clkmn,MrCarlosDanger,2,Thu Jul 9 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot here. First and foremost is how good your league mates are at scouting? If they're terrible, your guess seems about right, maybe a little high. If they're pretty sharp, your picks are devalued that much more.   It would also stratify top picks more as well. Breakout guys who are draft eligible will have outsized value in this format."
DynastyFF,3clkmn,MrCarlosDanger,2,Wed Jul 8 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"Varies wildly as far as my league mates. There's some folks that are pretty good talent evaluators, and are willing to spend premiums on ""established"" guys who are in the current year's draft.  There's also folks that don't hesitate to trade away all of their college picks at the drop of a hat because they don't want to try and hit the lottery tickets (these are the people I want to prey on).  Mostly I'm just trying to calibrate myself for outside discussion posts to be able to apply things as needed to my league."
DynastyFF,3clkmn,MrCarlosDanger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:17:33 2015 UTC,I gotcha. Do you have a college draft result from this year or last? Just to get a sense of who's going where.
DynastyFF,3clbux,tu_tall_jones,8,Wed Jul 8 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"He really should be gone by 1.11. I'd imagine somewhere closer to 1.04 in all honesty unless this is a playground league. I think I would only take Cooper/Gurley/Gordon over him. Maybe im a bit high. I love White, but I see them as similar in my mind and Ill take what I know in Arob."
DynastyFF,3clbux,Sticky_Z,3,Wed Jul 8 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"This was where my head was at too - love White, but target competition is stiff and coupled with a mediocre quarterback. It's also frustrating to see Fox continue his patterns of delaying rookies getting play time (though I'm hopeful White will establish as clear #2 by the end of TC - Fox's bullheadedness be damned). Most likely it's a better investment for the future.  Robinson's a known quantity - he's already the established X, and a target monster. Nobody's going to keep him from the field. I'd much rather have the erratic but growing Bortles than Cutler. Definitely take him over White if available."
DynastyFF,3clbux,bastegod,3,Wed Jul 8 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"I see it the same way, for me he is in one tier with White and Parker and should be gone at 1.06. White is raw, Parker hurt and we already saw what Robinson can do - but I guess you could make an argument for each of these three."
DynastyFF,3clbux,xxandl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I never even considered Robinson as high as three.  But you all make good points and that seems to be the consensus in this thread.  I guess I have the rookie blinders on too, thanks for enlightening me."
DynastyFF,3clbux,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"Its really important when evaluating rookies and player values compared to rookie picks in sort of a comparative way. Take a step back and say would I take this guy over this other guy? I definitely would take Arob over White. But would I take like jmatt? Some would, some wouldn't . It's how I answer myself and others when they ask a price check for a players in terms of rookie picks."
DynastyFF,3clbux,opeyum,5,Thu Jul 9 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"I think its a very far stretch to see him at 1.11. He was a 1.12-15 guy in his rookie draft. hes proven he has talent and good chemistry with bortles. In comparison to this years draft, i dont think you will see him go lower than 1.05. I would consider him only behind Cooper/Gurley. White and Gordon make a solid case for 3/4 so now you have robinson, parker, yeldon. I take robinson. And for some reason if your league has rookie fever, 1.08 would be the absolute last spot he should drop down to."
DynastyFF,3clbux,Sw33tch1nmusic,3,Wed Jul 8 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"According to what people are demanding for him in trades in this sub,  he should be going 1.01."
DynastyFF,3clbux,Sw33tch1nmusic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:10:37 2015 UTC,You have seen him traded for more than 1.01 in value?
DynastyFF,3clbux,thefadd,2,Thu Jul 9 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"People are demanding minimum a 1.mid to early this year and a 1 next year. bare minimum if not more. I don't buy into that logic, he's a jag and he's Getting overhyped based on being a Rockstar at aging without pads. I'd rank him behind Yeldon and Abdullah and algalor. So 1.09 range at best in my unpopular opinion"
DynastyFF,3clbux,quickonthedrawl,3,Thu Jul 9 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"ESPN The Magazine has him #31 in redraft leagues, one behind Jarvis Landry, four behind Kevin White, and three ahead of Agholor. So, yeah, he's gonna get blown up and on the slim chance that he's there at 1.11, you better take him. And if you want him don't wait.  Personally, I think those are ridiculous expectations to have of White in year one but I do think he's got the Julio Jones talent while Robinson has ""only"" Boldin talent so I would not be taking Robinson at 1.03.  1.03 would not be a crazy place to take him but especially given the sounds of your league, I gotta believe it's overvaluing him. If Jameis is going top ten, I wouldn't be shocked to see Robinson fall (especially given that no one cares enough to stash him) but he'd also be worth moving up for if he started to slip to 1.08/1.09 unless you had a serious bead on what the guys ahead of you are doing.  Ultimately, I think your range for him should be 1.05-1.07."
DynastyFF,3clbux,jdr393,5,Thu Jul 9 01:33:57 2015 UTC,"I take him after Cooper and Gurley but before anybody else. I would gladly take Robinson over Gordon, and I would probably take him over White as well.  Love, love, love him."
DynastyFF,3clbux,jdr393,4,Wed Jul 8 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"I would look to trade down from the 1.03 to maybe the 1.06 spot.   I like White and he should be the clear choice for you at 1.03. I think Gordon is going to disappoint a lot of people. The Chargers offensive line was brutal for rushing. A number of his big time plays were breaking off 60 yard runs - which just does not happen often in the NFL. He ran into his offensive line for no gain a lot at Wisconsin. I think he will be fine, but I personally think Gurley, Cooper, White, Parker are all better options.   Reason I would trade down - I like White and Robinson about the same. However, rookie fever will set in and you can likely get A Rob at 1.05-1.07 + whatever assets came in for the 1.03. If someone takes him before you have a chance you are left with Parker/Yeldon/Perriman - which is a pretty great selection in my opinion.  If no trade offers were possible, I would flip a coin between A Rob and White, but I would lean towards A Rob - just based on he has already proven to be a solid receiver at the NFL level.   If A Rob lasted until 11 that would be amazing."
DynastyFF,3clbux,UnderAchievingDog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like in most leagues he wouldn't last untill 1.11, but every league is different and I can see some oddball picks/decisions in my draft.  For instance, there are only 6 teams that have all 12 first round picks.  One of the teams has picks 1.4, 1.5 and 1.10 and is ungodly loaded as wide receiver already (Dez, A Brown, J Nelson, Evans, Landry, Desean Jackson) and you can only roster 6.  I know the team at 1.06 will take Perriman, huge Ravens fan.  And there has usually at least one IDP taken in the first round in past years.  Though maybe not this year as the talent isn't as strong.  So long story short, it could happen."
DynastyFF,3clbux,MrCarlosDanger,0,Thu Jul 9 01:39:12 2015 UTC,"Sure - I think it helps knowing the landscape of the league (as you do). For example, if you weren't being forced to a max of 6 receivers, I would guess he would take at least 1-2 so he can continue to have ungodly receivers or trade his older studs to make way for the new guys. IDP in the first round is also something that would never happen in my league (3rd round is where it starts for my league). If you snag him at 11 that would be great for you."
DynastyFF,3clbux,seeing_red415,2,Thu Jul 9 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds solid, may possibly look to trade some picks for a better Qb? Maybe the 1.3, 1.11, and Foles for Wilson? Don't know how you could swing that or what people value players in your league."
DynastyFF,3clbux,mtux96,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yes I am going to try and make that happen if possible.  A few players I have been trying to send offers for are Wilson (owner has Rodgers) or Tannehill (owner has Flacco and Kaps).  I haven't received so much as a decline on any of my offers, I think those two owners are dormant for the summer, I may try again right before our rookie draft."
DynastyFF,3clbux,quickonthedrawl,2,Thu Jul 9 01:22:07 2015 UTC,He seems to be a 35-45 overall guy according to a few rankings.   Based on that 1.05-1.07 would be about right value wise. May be higher or lower depending on your league. If he was dropped last year you may be able to get him for a steal.
DynastyFF,3clbux,quickonthedrawl,2,Wed Jul 8 21:07:15 2015 UTC,"In my PPR dynasty startup, Allen Robinson was drafted after 8 rookies.  He went after Gurley, Cooper, White, Gordon, Parker, DGB, Agholor, and Yeldon.  He went 1 pick before Perriman."
DynastyFF,3clbux,dumbname2,2,Wed Jul 8 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is on par on this question, though my question would be is why is Robinson on the waiver wire to begin with?"
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,akbfrosty,7,Wed Jul 8 18:41:08 2015 UTC,Jeff Janis.  JANIS JANIS JANIS
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,peckx063,3,Wed Jul 8 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"I love me some Robert Woods, but the situation is pretty unfortunate. If he moves in free agency, his value is going to skyrocket.   Eddie Royal is another. Royal has the talent to be a 1000 yard receiver, but there are lots of mouths to feed in Chicago."
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,umaro900,3,Wed Jul 8 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Brian Quick for me. He was producing like a low end WR2 with Austin Davis at QB. With the ugly shoulder injury he's dropped off of everyone's radar, but having a legit NFL quarterback could do wonders for him. He's my 6th WR but he makes for a nice lottery ticket."
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,LincolnSteve,3,Wed Jul 8 19:49:39 2015 UTC,Stevie Johnson.
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,whomadethesausages,2,Wed Jul 8 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"I would answer Stevie, but I anticipate him getting a bunch of starts for me as a flex. Especially with Gates getting the 4 game banhammer."
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,chkessle,2,Thu Jul 9 14:15:16 2015 UTC,Reuben Randle. I'm gonna draft him everywhere but only start him because of injuries or bye weeks. He'll be very solid in PPR. OBJ is gonna command a hell of a lot of attention this season.
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,Santidreet,2,Wed Jul 8 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"Davante Adams, Donte Moncrief, or Christine Michael are easy choices, but it sounds like you might want sleepers and such.   Off the top of my head maybe Jeff Janis, Josh Huff, Cody Latimer, Michael Campanaro  There's a whole bunch man"
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,Dr_Lollygag,6,Wed Jul 8 18:46:17 2015 UTC,Christine Michael is in the doghouse and has a lot of competition at his position...  He's also not a WR.  I'm gambling on Marquess Wilson as a flier. John Fox historically waits on rookies and the Kevin White hype is strong. Marquess has the physical tools and the opportunity.
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,dudhunter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:18 2015 UTC,Marquess is a nice low risk gamble.
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,thefadd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'd think Adams and Moncrief owners might expect something from them this year, but love Janis too.  And i'm more specifically talking about YOUR guy, not a list of some guys."
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:13:42 2015 UTC,Then I guess I'll settle on Janis for you sweetheart
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,peginus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:43:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't put my money on Latimer producing much this year unless there's an injury to DT or Sanders.  He's still learning the position and John Fox offenses don't usually produce a lot of fantasy relevant WRs.

DynastyFF,3ckxtj,thefadd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say Davante Adams is actually underrated. The Packers' third WR spot has consistently put up significant numbers in years past and actually underperformed this past season vs my personally expectations. Now that's solidly his position at a minimum, he's hands down the #1 fantasy ""bench"" guy."
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,chkessle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:16 2015 UTC,"Eddie Royal.  He is an all around good dude.   On a hunch, I'm podering rolling him out in week 1 and see how he does playing with Smokin' Jay again. Once the season gets properly rolling along, I don't see him maintaining a high level of fantasy points. I'll be cheering for him though, and with a new offense and everything going on there, he could be a viable WR3/4..."
DynastyFF,3ckxtj,dtownnbachamps04,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"Cole Beasley for me.  I see the cowboys throwing the ball more this year and with the way they were using him towards the back of last season, I like Beasley as a perfect bye week sub that you can throw in there for 13-15 points (PPR)"
DynastyFF,3cku4q,white54mamba,3,Wed Jul 8 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yikes man. Aside from dez this isn't too hot, no offense. Without knowing if it's PPR, league size, the rest of your roster and contract situation and cap (sounds like contract league), I choose Amari."
DynastyFF,3cku4q,doodwhersmycar,2,Wed Jul 8 18:23:35 2015 UTC,PPR  12 Team and yes its contract.  i would sign either to a max deal.
DynastyFF,3cku4q,doodwhersmycar,5,Wed Jul 8 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"PPR, I go Amari to match with dez for a nice core for your team. But personally I would consider possibly a full on rebuild meaning see what you could pull for dez in a haul. Not sure your competing. Sry if I'm being brash, but it's a decision you should consider."
DynastyFF,3cku4q,Stretch2,3,Wed Jul 8 22:03:00 2015 UTC,Truth hurts. There's a reason you're picking 1.2. Go rebuild mode
DynastyFF,3cku4q,bastegod,2,Thu Jul 9 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"Gordon going 1.1, leaving Gurley or Cooper to you at 1.2? Sweet jesus.   As for the pick I don't see how you don't take Gurley, I really don't. Even with injury, and even with the Rams, he's that special talent. Foles can at the least air out a ball and keep a backfield honest, and their O-line pieces will develop in the next few years. Alternately I'm not sold on Carr yet, though Cooper can't be denied.  EDIT: PPR puts things more in Cooper's favor, and your upcoming major loss at WR is considerable. Hard choice for sure - but true foundational backs are becoming scarce."

DynastyFF,3cku4q,Stretch2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"I'd let 1.01 take Gordon. I like Cooper a little bit more in your situation, especially in PPR. If you can pick and trade, I'd select Cooper and offer him to the person picking at 1.03. If he makes a legit offer great, if not, Cooper is a great pick at 1.02 in PPR."

The guy at 1.3 apparently wanted Gurley, so he offered his pick for trade and I traded for it and got Amari. Was happy to have both :)"

DynastyFF,3clxug,animesekaielric,2,Thu Jul 9 00:10:18 2015 UTC,"Your valuation on cooks is off. He's worth more than a 1st round pick.  That's debatable if the pick is 1.01, but that's about it."
DynastyFF,3clxug,MrCarlosDanger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:35:41 2015 UTC,"Both Cooper and Gurley are going before Cooks in startup ADP. Which means he's not worth ""more"" than a 1st, nor was /u/animesekaleric ""way off"" in value."
DynastyFF,3clxug,Tcrowaf,2,Thu Jul 9 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"Although I think cooks is equal to 1.01 or two mid to late round firsts, his ADP has constantly been rising. Depending on the site you go to, he's as high as 17th on the list which is above 1.01 and right around Jordy and Calvin. ADP isn't everything FYI, your own evaluations are."
DynastyFF,3clxug,zadloo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:58:15 2015 UTC,"ADP isn't everything FYI, your own evaluations are.   Well, of course. There are basically two ways that we can talk about value in these situations. The easiest is when an owner is selling a player. Whatever he says his value is, is what it is. If another owner tells me he won't sell Eric Ebron for anything less than a high first round pick, that's what Ebron costs. I think it's crazy, but that's why I simply walk away in that hypothetical.  The second way you can talk about value is to argue what a player ""ought"" to be valued at. ADP is simply a tool of this argument. It's saying ""see, other people agree with me."" Because neither of us are setting the Cooks market in this specific situation, or the entire Cooks market at large, this is the type of value we're talking about.   Depending on the site you go to, he's as high as 17th on the list which is above 1.01 and right around Jordy and Calvin.   Now if we're having a conversation about what his value ought to be, I think that's insane. He was evaluated as the 3rd or 4th best receiver last year, was definitely leapfrogged by OBJ, and I don't think he necessarily gained ground on Jordan Matthews.   He's a very talented undersized receiver, who will consequently always be an injury concern, and will always have to have his touches manufactured in a sense. If I'm a Cooks owner in a league with another player that thinks he's worth 17th overall, I'm selling hard every time. Give me Amari Cooper or Jordan Matthews for that matter, especially if I'm getting some sweetener on top of it."
DynastyFF,3clxug,Tcrowaf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between ""a"" 1st and the 1.01 and I think you realize that.  Saying a guy is worth 3 1sts is also not saying he's worth 3 1.01's.   Rankings have those 3 (cooks, cooper, gurley) in some sort of variable order, but all in the same area.   Also I don't understand why you used direct quotes on ""way off"" when all I said was ""off"".    No need to use exaggeration to make a point when what i wrote is right above."
DynastyFF,3clxug,MrCarlosDanger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to say that Cooks is worth a high first round pick.  If I'm a seller, I'm probably aiming for that 1.01, I agree with that.  That said, I'm certainly not buying him for anything more than 1.04 at this point. He will always carry injury concerns at his size, and I think his effectiveness will always be scheme dependent to an extent.   Apologies for the ""way,"" it was not intentional."
DynastyFF,3clxug,Tcrowaf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"And that's fine, it sounds like you're a little lower on him than consensus. For me personally with a cooks trade, cooper/gurley is a conversation I'd have, but White/Gordon isn't enough to move my needle. But no matter your opinion of him is, you probably aren't shipping him out for any less than that simply because of the market value.   A lot of times for the ""3 1st for a stud"" rule I notice the caveat of 1 has to be a guaranteed high 1st.   And no worries. God knows I get a little excited sometimes when I'm making a point."

DynastyFF,3clxug,Tcrowaf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"Id do this deal easy based on my love for Cooks, but I think I would look to swap out some of the players in the deal if I was you.   You dont have much of a need for Bridgewater or Cameron once you do this deal, so look to get that value in the form of another WR or a young RB. Those two together might be worth a decent rookie pick if you could try to get one thrown in."
DynastyFF,3clxug,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, Gronk is a top 3 dynasty asset...cooks is a young talented guy, but he's no sure thing. You don't need Bridgewater, and those two TEs, even if you combined their weekly scores likely wouldn't outscore Gronk.  A guy worth three 1st for what essentially adds up to one 1st, two 2nds and a late 3rd... bad deal."

DynastyFF,3clxug,opeyum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'd counter Gronk/2nd for Cooks/Lacy. You're really not hurting for WR talent...so it's not worth overpaying or even paying the even price for Cooks/Lacy just yet.  If your set on getting Eifert/Cameron as well, then I'd swap Hyde for a 1st rounder and send him that.  Edit: for the record, you've got a lot of great young talent on your roster, and will probably be a contender for quite a while...the only weakness I see is a 2nd real RB starter (coleman may be the answer, but he's not a sure thing). I'd ride out the season with your current roster, and try to get a top 3 pick next year and grab one of the stud RBS that's coming out (looking at Ezekiel Elliott) and you'll be set."

DynastyFF,3ckijo,Theczarcasticone,3,Wed Jul 8 16:56:47 2015 UTC,If you get Mark Ingram in my opinion this is an easy accept.
DynastyFF,3ckijo,PaoloPWD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Though only with that caliber of sidecar imo.   I have homer devotion to DT as a Denverite, and there's a lot of sense to grabbing him while in win now, but I'd be sure you're ready to really run at throne this year. Everything points to a giant regression in DT's immediate future, and very likely a drop from last year. Manning's here for maybe two more seasons if we're very lucky, but a lot of folks in the front office anticipate the Osweiler era in 2017. Sanders has come in with great work, and siphoned a number of looks. Kubes is turning the Broncos onto his run-heavy ZBS system, and while its still Manning, the bonkers passing rates of the last few years are sure to regress.   There's also no new contract yet between DT and the home office, and he's not participated in any offseason activities so far, which may spill over into training camp - all more ancillary shit, but worth considering.   I definitely wouldn't deal for much less than Ingram as an addition in that swap - Watkins in two years is a lot to give up."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,bastegod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagree with a giant regression coming for DT.  Will he take a small step back when Peyton leaves? Possibly, but I doubt it's anything significant. He's still an elite level talent.  Let's not forget, Sanders supposedly siphoned a lot of talents last year, and DT still 110/1600/11."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:21:54 2015 UTC,"Peyton leaving, and Sanders getting his cut alone aren't enough to support the probability of a significant regression - but those aren't even the biggest issues. Kubiak's scheme is a completely different game than either Fox or Gase were running. Broncos will revert back to a run-first team, and have the RB talent to do so. Flat fact is the level of passing, and wideout targets in general, are dropping - and that means less to go around for everyone. Also coming are far more two-TE sets, which means Virgil Green and transferee Owen Daniels will also be taking a slice of the pie.   Also, while I'm hopeful, Osweiler is completely unproven in the position - and there's no guarantee he can run an offense successfully.   I appreciate your feelings on DT - I love him, but the opportunity for a decent step back over the next few years is still there."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,bastegod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"Fair point about Kubiak. He certainly will run the ball more, but Kubiak also has a history of hammering his #1 WR with targets. I would assume that will continue in Denver.   I suspect that Sanders will see a solid drop in targets, and the other WRs will see significant drops in targets. I think DT will see a small drop in targets, but I also think that his depth of targets will increase. Kubiak tends to throw the ball deep and runs a ton of play action"
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"You're basically selling future value for now value, which is usually a bad decision in dynasty. That being said the rest of your team seems in young and in decent shape. In 2017 you'll still have a relatively young Luck, Hill, Hyde, Cobb, ARob, and Moncrief. DT is a risky pickup though because his value is definitely going to take a hit if Manning retires after this year and I doubt you'll be able to get 3 1sts for him next year. I'd guess he'll be worth next year what Watkins is worth now or less depending on QB situation.  It's a tough call. I'd say it's an overpay for DT in a vacuum, but you'll have a significantly better chance of winning this year with him. If it was me, I'd try to see Watkins straight up for Alshon or maybe Jmatt+, Cooks+, Golden Tate + something like that. If you can include Ingram it's a lot closer for me and I think I'd do it."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,just_trizzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"My league is just full of guys who don't like Sammy/Sammy's situation, so I've had a really hard time finding any of those type of deals for him.  I'm with you on that thinking, I'd rather do one of those, those type of offers just aren't available."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,just_trizzy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:22:37 2015 UTC,"I just traded for Sammy myself so I know what you mean. I feel like I got him really cheap but others think I overpaid. His situation is crap this year, but his talent will insulate his value. He wouldn't be a bad hold and even though I'm not holding my breath he also might make a breakout jump this year. His 3rd year though no one will be able to ignore him anymore and I have no doubt he'll be worth OBJ+ value."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"Can't you make this exact same argument for DT?  His talent should insulate his value, even if Peyton retires."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,just_trizzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:23:47 2015 UTC,"It will insulate is value, but it's different than Watkins due to his age. His situation will be worst, he will be a year older, and there will be a lot of young WRs who will be likely to produce similar numbers to him so combine those and I just don't see how his value will not decrease to a 2nd round pick like Jordy or even worst is he ends up on a bad team.   Watkins situation can only improve. His QB won't get worst and he's only 22. DT is at the peak of his hill about to walk down and Watkins just started walking up it."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"Lot of young WRs likely to produce similar numbers to him? Like who? OBJ? He's the only young WR who has come close to him really.  It's not like DT is 32 years old. He's 27. His situation might be worse (if Peyton leaves) but I still wouldn't call it better than Buffalo's. Rex pounds the rock, it's that simple."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,just_trizzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:44:19 2015 UTC,"It would be that simple if this were a redraft league we were talking about, but it's not this is Dynasty. He's 27 this year which is his peak year, next year he'll be 28 which is when WRs statistically begin their descent in production not to mention losing the Manning bump.  Just off the top of my head OBJ, Mike Evans, Watkins himself, Cooks, Matthews, Cobb, Alshon, Deandre will all potentially be capable of putting up similar numbers to DT in 2016 and will create longer term value for your team, plus who knows if anyone else will break out this season. Not to mention the guys who are already at the top he's going to have to compete with. Rex might pound the rock, but he's not stupid. He knows what he has to work with in Watkins and not using him to his fullest will be the fastest way for him to lose his job. Yes Watkins situation isn't great this year but you're a fool if you think that won't try to maximize his value next year with a better QB and whatever else they need for him to succeed after what they paid for him and just due to how freaking talented the kid is. Seriously, have you seen his tape? He's unreal. Watkins is their future and it's easier to replace Rex than Watkins.  Look, I'm not saying DT isn't going to be valuable, just that he's going to lose value next year in dynasty leagues for very obvious reasons which he will. Think Jordy Nelson or Calvin Johnson. But make up your own mind, dude. Invest at your own peril, but he WILL lose value next year unless he stays with Manning and I just don't see any defensible reason to think he wont. If you own him (and it sounds like you might from how defensive you're getting) I'd sell him this season and if you're thinking of buying, I wouldn't pay full price unless you need a championship this year because he'll be cheaper next year. I guarantee it."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting defensive at all. I own both DT and Sammy in several leagues. I'm simply debating your points, that's all.  I don't disagree that DT's value will likely fall. I'm simply saying I don't think it will be a drastic decline. I also think it's a fallacy to simply assume that Sammy's value will rise. Honestly, I think after this year his value may even be lower than it currently is, simply due to recency bias.  I'm not disputing Sammy's talent, he's uber talented. But I don't think he will really come close to matching DT's numbers next year. I understand dynasty is all about long term value, but you also have to take into account what value can you get for the next 2-3 years. I don't think there's any chance Sammy puts up similar numbers as DT over the next 3 years.  All the leagues that I won DT (which is only a few) I am a contender, so there's no point in me selling. It's not like 28 is a death knell for WRs. His productivity might slowly, slowly decline. But I'm willing to bet he's a WR1 for at least the next 3 years. It's not all about market value for me. If I can feel confident that someone can provide WR1 numbers for 2-3 years, I'll take that all day. I don't believe that with Sammy."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,just_trizzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:39:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Never said DT's value would decline drastically, just that it would decline. I see him somewhere around a mid-2nd rounder next year if Manning is gone.  As for Watkins we'll have to agree to disagree. But the second Buffalo puts a competent QB out there slinging him the ball he'll put up WR1 numbers and it's speculative, but I think that happens in 2016 and I think it boosts his value to the 1st round same as Evans."
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:50:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think the part I struggle with is Buffalo somehow finding a competent QB next year. The fact is, there's just not that many out there. And I think Buffalo's defense is elite. So elite, that they're not going to have a top 10 pick, aka a pick to nab an elite rookie QB.   Other than the draft, where do you think they're going to find this competent QB?"
DynastyFF,3ckijo,auggiedoggies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:41:18 2015 UTC,"This is an easy accept even if you can't get Ingram IMO.  Love Sammy's talent, but he's no more talented than DT. People are scared of DT's situation when Peyton leaves....how about Sammy's situation? Stuck on a heavy run first offense, with no QB, and a couple of decent WRs to siphon targets? I'd rather have Osweiler than be stuck in Buffalo.  This is an instant accept for me, Ingram or not"

Robinson vs Ingram + 2016 1st.  2nd offer - robinson + late 2016 pick vs ingram + 2016 1st.  3rd offer - Robinson + old talent (roddy white/steve smith/Boldin) vs Ingram + 2016 1st.  if he doesnt accept, time to move on. At this point, Robinson is worth all those trades. Dont sell yourself short"
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,PaoloPWD,5,Wed Jul 8 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Nope, you made a great decision, Robinson is much more valuable."
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,aussiemac24,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Right decision, You can get way more for Robinson. I'd say he's probably worth 2 1sts where Ingram is worth 1st/2nd depending on how people view him."
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,LincolnSteve,2,Wed Jul 8 16:14:23 2015 UTC,"As of right now Ingram for Robinson is a fair trade. Robinson is getting a lot of good press in Jacksonville and as you mentioned his value may increase if we keep hearing good things. As with any young WR, Robinson holds better long term value.  For 2015 Ingram may be a more important piece of the puzzle for a contender. If he keeps his same role as last year in N.O. and the Saints transition to a more run dependent gameplan as advertised Ingram holds a lot of value as a high end RB2. Just like Robinson, if word comes out of training camp that Ingram looks good and will see 15-20 carries a game with goal line work, his value (especially in the short term) could increase as well.  There is definitely a risk here that if you trade Robinson for Ingram in two years people will be asking you why in the world you gave up Robinson. On the other hand, in a 16 team league acquiring one of the legit RB2s is not going to be easy once the season starts. By the time Gurley takes over in St Louis having Ingram in over McKinnon could be enough to win you a few games.  Tough call, but with your roster and a chance to win it all I'd lean towards rolling the dice on Ingram. if it makes you feel any better in a startup draft both guys go at almost the same ADP."
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,JacoDaDon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem that he's a contender yet judging by the fact that he has Gurley.  He most likely had the 1 or 2 pick which unless he acquired that pick via trade means he finished worst or 2nd worst in the league.  You don't want to give up that potential value for an aging, oft injured back.  OP, you made a good decision."

So, yes -- I'm a contender :)"
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,bastegod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:52:33 2015 UTC,The Ditka. That's a bold trade. If you are trying to win now it does a lot more for you this year than later round picks will. Out of curiosity would any negative reports on Gurley's availability to start the season put you off drafting him? FYI I'm a Rams fan so I've been following it pretty closely and everything so far sounds positive.
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,LincolnSteve,2,Wed Jul 8 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"It was a tough decision but I think every dynasty owner who's on the brink of a run needs to make one or two aggressive moves to get the right mix of young players. I'm looking at a core of Russell Wilson, Gurley, Dez, OBJ, Cooks, and Kelce for the next 5 years, so like you said...those draft picks don't hold the same appeal as they did when I was rebuilding. I will consider taking Melvin Gordon at #1 if Gurley has a major setback, but TG is unique. As the Rams' GM said on draft night, he's a once-every-few-years type of player."
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,bastegod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"What about CJ Spiller? Last year Ingram had little competition outside of injury with Pierre Thomas in decline, Khiry Robinson a hohum replacement, and an ineffective scatback in Travaris Cadet. But Spiller is actually a decent talent in an entirely more friendly offense, and will ideally be utilized in a very Sprolesian fashion. It's exactly how he always should have been used in Buffalo, and should yield dividends. At the least he's guaranteed if healthy to cut into the third-down work and RB passing game."
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,LincolnSteve,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:42:53 2015 UTC,"I get the concern about Spiller, but he really compliments Ingram well. Ingram didn't get a lot of passing down work last year. Even in his role he did manage to catch more passes than expected last year, but he did very little with the ones he got.  All I need from Ingram is two downs and goal line work and he holds his value just fine in a .5 PPR. Here's a nice analysis from Mike Triplett at ESPN of the Saints players fantasy value.  The first part focuses on the backfield.  http://espn.go.com/blog/new-orleans-saints/post/_/id/15936/saints-fantasy-sleepers-brandin-cooks-c-j-spiller-and-benjamin-watson"
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,blardorg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"I read you - in terms of Ingram holding his value, where do you have him placed ADP wise in 0.5 (my favorite PPR)? Or is there an ADP reference you appreciate as indicative of your own?"
DynastyFF,3ck5bi,JoshNipples,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:51 2015 UTC,I'm with you on .5 PPR preference. Overall I'd rank him in the low 50's in .5 PPR startup. That's not too far off of the DLF & DFW mock ADPs. Rotoviz has his ADP in the low 40s.  For the OP's win now situation I think Ingram's signifigantly earlier redraft ADP comes into play. He's going about 3 rounds earlier than Robinson which is a nice clue as to the difference in their 2015 only value.
DynastyFF,3ciqxd,sethrox,2,Wed Jul 8 05:52:05 2015 UTC,"based on your team needs, i think you did well drafting. As others are saying I too would also prefer White over Yeldon but that would have been strictly for trade bait (I try to always draft BPA and not for need). I think you have a nice young team with two options since rookie fever is still in effect. You can package trade up some of them and grab 1-2 elite players, or just ride it out and hope half of them arnt bust."
DynastyFF,3ciqxd,opeyum,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand BPA, but in this particular league, starting RB's are so hard to come across with 16 teams. And White scares me as a bust player."
DynastyFF,3ciqxd,blardorg,2,Wed Jul 8 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"Since you already took Gurley and Gordon and needed help at WR, I definitely would've passed on Yeldon to take White.   Projected starters, with flexes in italics:  Cam / Gurley / Gordon / Yeldon / Matthews / Perriman / Landry / Ertz, with good quality depth guys in Flacco, Ingram, Parker, and Ebron.   Since it's a 16 team league, I think as long as your rookies don't bust hard and Matthews/Landry/Ertz keep going with their upward trajectories, I think you'll be in really good shape after this year. If the rookies come out of the gates strong, you might even be a playoff team this year, but I'd be cautious expecting that."

DynastyFF,3ciqxd,peckx063,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:11:43 2015 UTC,Would like to see all the trades u made for those pics. Young core. Definitely in a complete rebuild you should have built your WR core especially in PPR. I'm a firm believer in that. I would have absolutely selected white in there but you stole Perriman at 12 so that's a huge help. You're young and unless some guys truly break the game this season you'll most likely have another high pick to add to your rebuild next year to.

DynastyFF,3cgvv5,sodadiplomas,7,Tue Jul 7 20:32:26 2015 UTC,Everyone here needs to read the scoring. Mcdonald will be a very high scoring player. He also sits just outside of the top tier at the position. The question you need to ask is whether he will give you more of an advantage at DB than Robinson will at WR. I would say more than likely.
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,fropek,2,Tue Jul 7 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making me not feel totally crazy. For reference, here are some averages from last season  Odell: 23.7  Antonio Brown: 23.4  Le'Veon Bell: 22.1  JJ Watt: 21.8  Julio Jones: 18.3  Lavonte David: 17.6  Chris Borland: 17.6  TJ McDonald: 12  Allen Robinson: 10.8"
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,slodanslodan,6,Tue Jul 7 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"The weekly averages are great, but you need to look at is the replacement value to adjust for positional value.  Your league starts 2 WR with another in the FLEX. (0.75 PPR means that you'll probably be starting a WR in flex).   The replacement value for Allen Robinson is his weekly score less the average weekly score for WR37 (you can take the WR37 directly or use an average of the last few years).  The replacement value for McDonald will be the same, with either LB25 or LB37 depending on whether you play LB in DFLEX.  If LBs are a dime a dozen, then their scores will fall off less rapidly than WR scores. It gets worse if you usually start just two LBs and are eating more WR depth than LB depth."
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,blardorg,4,Tue Jul 7 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic post.   /u/sodadiplomas, can you list what your current DBs averaged last year? And can you list what the best 1 or 2 FA, available DBs averaged last year? Neither of these gives you exactly McDonald's value over replacement, but it gives something similar and useful.  Even with high IDP scoring, I suspect it is still better to hold Robinson than trade for McDonald, but it is by no means a sure thing. With 0.75 PPR, and given your RBs, it is probably better for you to start 4 WRs each week, and Robinson will be a massively better option than Patterson.   The other point I would make is that even if, given their value over replacement, swapping Robinson for McDonald is technically a totally reasonable thing to do, I suspect in almost every league people at least slightly undervalue their IDPs. You saw how almost everyone's knee jerk reaction to your post was ""you're crazy!"", without even considering the scoring. So I doubt you have to give Robinson to get McDonald. I would infinitely rather do something like Patterson + Josh Gordon, or Hurns + Patterson, or any of those three WRs + one of your current DBs."
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,blardorg,3,Tue Jul 7 22:31:31 2015 UTC,Sure.  2014 Top FA DBs    Player Total Pts    Ron Parker 169.5   Malcolm Jenkins 164.75   Johnathan Joseph 161.25   Glover Quin 158.5    2014 Top Overall DBs    Player Total Pts    Harrison Smith 201   Morgan Burnett 199.75   Charles Woodson 197.4   TJ McDonald 192.25    2014 My DBs    Player Total Pts    Joe Haden 166.25 (missed 1 game)   Patrick Peterson 115.75   Michael Griffin 190.75    I had various other DBs off the waiver wire at various points of the season as well
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,slodanslodan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"Given guys like Jenkins and Quin on the wire, I'd definitely turn this down. However, it isn't thaaat crazy imo, especially if you're low on Jax offense or high on McDonald. Still, I don't think you're getting a big enough advantage with McDonald over guys available for free or that you already have to make it worth giving up Robinson."
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,fropek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"Good point about waiver-wire replacement. If it's a league without a lot of trade activity, it may be tougher to get a replacement through trade. I personally use replacement value by starting slots so that I don't over- or under-value depth.  As a very minor correction, it is a 2WR league with a single flex, so we're looking at starting 2-3 RB and 2-3 WR."
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,fropek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:03:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for expanding on what I was saying. This is great advice
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,quickonthedrawl,2,Wed Jul 8 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"I probably would not make the deal as I'm very high on Robinson, but it's not really that terrible of an offer."
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:07:30 2015 UTC,How much did the DB36 score per game last year?
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,blardorg,2,Tue Jul 7 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Top DBs are going to score a lot, but so will the average DBs. Between all of the S and CB available and only needing to start 2 weekly, OP could even perhaps stream a DB and not lose too much value. I have very little respect in fantasy for DBs though for the most part.  Can't imagine McDonald's startup value is even remotely close to Robinson? At least 5+ rounds difference?"
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,quickonthedrawl,4,Tue Jul 7 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"As with any position, higher scoring settings won't just make everyone at the position score more, it will also magnify the differences between players within that position. As an extremely simple example, a DB that records 2 tackles vs. a DB that records 1 tackle will be a 1 point difference if tackles are worth 1 point, and a 2 point difference if tackles are worth 2 points. The point differential, and therefore positional advantage gained by having the better of the two DBs, doubled with a scoring change. Since offensive player scoring didn't change, that kind of change in relative value for defensive players can totally invalidate our intuitions about offensive vs defensive player worth, given the kinds of IDP scoring settings we're used to. Don't underestimate the effect of scoring setting changes! It's exactly the same as why TE premium PPR or 6 pt passing TDs drastically change player values: it doesn't just make some positions score more, it increases the relative advantage of having top tier players at that position.  In this case, I actually agree with you, given the DBs available for free on the wire, and Robinson's value. But if IDP scoring was even a little higher than in op's league, I could definitely see McDonald having a big enough gap over lower tier DBs to make it a worthwhile trade."
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,fropek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:12:04 2015 UTC,"For sure that's right for some defensive scoring, but I can't imagine OP's league is anywhere close to that yet? In his league, Ron Parker (top scoring FA DB) scored 169.5. McDonald scored 192.25. Defensive scoring looks ~1.5x ""standard"" (if one exists) IDP scoring. So Parker translates to 113 points vs McDonald's 128 in ""standard.""  I think it's fair to assume that prioritized DB streaming could even get you a little better score than that? But even if not, that's a difference of 23 points instead of 15 points in standard scoring leagues between OP's scoring and normal, or per game, McDonald gains 1.4 points per game vs Parker's 0.9. I don't know what I'd pay for that kind of upgrade, but like you said, it's going to be something much less valuable than a top ~20 WR.  Would be interesting to figure out what kind of defensive scoring it would take before it became clear the other way. Maybe 3 point tackles and lots of big play scoring? Or even 2 point tackles might do it?"
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,Sticky_Z,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:14 2015 UTC,It depends on scoring and this league is particularly high for stats that DB's accumulate
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,Daphud,5,Tue Jul 7 22:47:23 2015 UTC,No...Just....No. Robinson is a 3rd round startup pick...McDonald is prolly like...i dont know....25th round?! Plus your DB's are fine...
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,bastegod,3,Tue Jul 7 20:42:52 2015 UTC,McDonald is WAY better than any of his DBs he has currently.
DynastyFF,3cgvv5,quickonthedrawl,2,Wed Jul 8 09:37:42 2015 UTC,"The scoring evens the playing field, but Robinson's got that lead-receiver edge on a growing team.

DynastyFF,3cgvv5,chiefst,3,Wed Jul 8 01:03:52 2015 UTC,"For the love of dynasty football, don't do this trade!  There are maybe a half dozen IDP players that I would trade Robinson straight up for. Literally the only IDP I would feel great about trading him for would be JJ Watt, no exaggeration."

DynastyFF,3cg2o7,Scarlet-Fire,3,Wed Jul 8 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to get a sense of this lately and everything points to as big a dart throw as you can imagine.   Guys emerge, decline and continue at their previous value. Some that you think would declare for the draft don't and same is true in the opposite direction. And then of course there's the prospect of what team they would even be drafted to.   Just from early guesses, it seems like QB and RB (DE for IDP) will be deep next year. WR seems shallow. But working with limited information is hard. And working with less of that limited information is even harder."
DynastyFF,3cg2o7,MrCarlosDanger,2,Tue Jul 7 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure I'd call WR shallow right off the bat. There are certainly a few promising names at the top. I like Boyd, Treadwell, Higgins, Mike Williams, Josh Reynolds (and the rest of the A&M receivers), and probably Pharoh Cooper and Josh Doctson. Of course, all but Doctson on that list might not even enter the draft, but I certainly like those guys more than a Breshad Perriman, and it's just a short list that excludes many favorites other people have."
DynastyFF,3cg2o7,umaro900,2,Tue Jul 7 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"In the same way you can't say QB or RB is solid off the bat, we don't know who will declare for sure.   This has just been my (huge grain of salt) sense of what the talent pool is projected at prior to the season even starting. We could have every one of those guys declare plus 3 Kevin white out of no where top tier WR'S, but at this point we just don't know."
DynastyFF,3cg2o7,MrCarlosDanger,2,Tue Jul 7 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"Certainly. However, I find it hard to believe that (short of injury) somebody like Higgins or Boyd would not declare after putting up about 2500 yards over two years. The other juniors are more likely not to declare, but again, if they repeat or improve upon their sophomore performances, the draft advisory board should certainly convince them to come to the NFL. When you're looking for top-tier dynasty players, it's usually the guys who declare as juniors that you want to target."
DynastyFF,3cg2o7,umaro900,3,Tue Jul 7 22:02:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember that half of the depth of a draft class can really be attributed to the opportunities available. Even if you can perfectly scout a class and determine the talent, the opportunities given to them only start to gain some clarity a few days into free agency. The NFL draft naturally gives a significant amount more.   With regards to talent, there are undoubtedly players who will be off our radars and break out this CFB season. With my own personal scouting of 2016 prospects, it's possible that about a dozen RBs and two dozen WRs are on the level a 2015 late first round pick in terms of talent, but there is absolutely no way there are that starting job openings. More realistically I would expect something like half a dozen RBs and a dozen WRs to have that sort of talent, which is roughly in line with the 2015 class.   I can throw out some names I really like so far, but I haven't done comprehensive enough scouting and analysis to say much more. I've mostly just looked at a few clips of guys to determine if I should bother watching more of them once the next CFB season gets underway. However, there are at least half a dozen 2017 prospects that I'm fawning over right now, and if you can pick up 2017 1sts at equal price to other years, I'd probably recommend that."

I've mostly been waiting for Draft Breakdown or some other sources to post more cut-ups of those players (and a few others I didn't include there for one reason or another) to do more thorough qualitative analysis, though. Josh Doctson is perhaps the most notable omission from those posts.   Regarding ranking those guys, I certainly haven't done enough work to give even a semblance of accuracy, but I can give some short(er) lists off the top of my head - guys who I more-or-less expect to be drafted early in the NFL draft. In terms of estimating the depth of a draft class, it's important to remember that the school a dude goes to/went to can turn talented dudes into late-round picks or UDFA's, which torpedos their value.   2016 RB short list:   Ezekiel Elliott Elijah McGuire Devontae Booker   HM: Matt Breida, Devon Johnson, Kareem Hunt, Derrick Henry  2016 WR short list:   Tyler Boyd Rashard Higgins Mike Williams Josh Reynolds Corey Davis Laquon Treadwell   HM: DJ Foster, Josh Doctson, Devin Lauderdale, Pharoh Cooper, Corey Coleman, Michael Thomas, Duke Williams, Byron Marshall  2017 short list:   Nick Chubb, RB Leonard Fournette, RB Dalvin Cook, RB Samaje Perine, RB Artavis Scott, WR Juju Smith, WR   HM: KD Cannon (WR), Darren Carrington (WR), Speedy Noil (WR), Ricky Seals-Jones (WR), Justin Jackson (RB)     Note that I really do have the same (or more) in those players I listed for 2017 as I do for the 2016 lists, and we are two years out there. They are really that good, even from a glance. Also note that there will be some [glaring] omissions from these lists. I simply haven't gotten around to watching everybody, and I've watched the dudes who passed my statistical filters first."
DynastyFF,3cg2o7,umaro900,3,Wed Jul 8 05:01:19 2015 UTC,"At QB I think you've got a lot more depth in 2016 than we had in 2015.  Assuming Goff, Hackenberg, and Jones declare for the draft there are 4 legitimate round 1-2 guys and then a few more 3-5 guys.   If you missed out on Winston and Mariotta this year 2016 looks much better."
DynastyFF,3cg2o7,LincolnSteve,2,Tue Jul 7 22:41:08 2015 UTC,"They talked about it on the latest /r/DynastyFF podcast. Its really hard to tell. I actually think it'll be a really nice draft. Lot of big names and when its a good QB class, the skill positions fall a bit."

DynastyFF,3cg8d2,eating_oatmeal,4,Tue Jul 7 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"I don't like trade 1. Greg olsen is good, but he isn't worth more than a 1st.  That pretty much sums up how I feel about #2 as well. I would hang onto Ladarius for another 2 months and let his value rise. Olsen isn't going to rise between now and then.   Trade 3 is meh. Sure, you're getting Thomas, who is worth 3 1sts? But giving up a nice piece like White, plus the minor pieces (that I'm high on), plus 1st... idk. I guess if you are pushing for the win you take it."

If you're looking to deal him, wait until you can get him for a good value. I'd treat Ladarius as a 1.10 pick in terms of value IMO. That last trade seems like your giving up 2 1sts, 2nd and 2 3rds for DT + trash. I like the beginnings of the trade, but would dumb it down: Kevin White + 2016 1st for DT"
DynastyFF,3cg8d2,JoshNipples,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:47 2015 UTC,"that was what i felt like as well, he wants to lose some age which is why he wanted to include the other pieces but it just seems like additional pieces for no reason"
DynastyFF,3cg8d2,chkessle,2,Tue Jul 7 18:34:38 2015 UTC,I would not like to be on your side of any of these trades.   It looks as if you have a good roster.   Green's value could really jump in the beginning of the year. You might be selling low for an older player and the loss of a top pick.
DynastyFF,3cg8d2,LincolnSteve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"hmm, this is just so interesting seeing in relation to the other threads regarding Ladarius Green on here over the past few days, even this thread from three days ago. I suppose his value can go up but it can very quickly plummet as well if he has a pedestrian game to start the season."
DynastyFF,3cg8d2,blardorg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"Trades 1 and 2 are the epitome of ""win now"" trades. If you are a Greg Olsen away from a championship, then I could see doing the first one., even though the price be steep.   You say that the second one is worse than the first, so no need to discuss further.   The third one is intriguing. I believe Demaryius is going to be putting up WR1 type numbers for a few more years. I would give Kevin white and a 1 for him now.  (Note that I'm not a huge white fan though.) The question then is do you like trading Greene, Matt Jones and a 3 for Marvin Jones and Brandon Lafell?  I'm leaning yes.  But I might try to make it a little sweeter. Make it a 4 instead of a 3."
DynastyFF,3cg8d2,blardorg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Looking at your roster I see the incentive to trade for Olsen in a 2 TE league. You currently have 5 TE2s. In another year or two Williams, Green and Ebron could all be fantasy starters, but right now it would be hard to pick the right two guys every week from your group. Olsen would make that  a lot easier.  The funny thing is that other than the ridiculous Kelce/Gronk pairing nobody really has a set of dominating TEs, so maybe your lack of a star at the position isn't too damaging.  Trades 2 & 3 you are paying too much. I wouldn't entertain either one without them coming down in price significantly."

You guys have a lot of good points, I guess I'm wondering if maybe i'm better off in the long run if I get a couple picks out of a trade... but that might be asking for too much anyways.. going to weigh this more and more up until the draft."
DynastyFF,3chfb3,swoodmanroxu,3,Wed Jul 8 00:20:16 2015 UTC,"You're win now, plain and simple. Anderson makes that happen, in my opinion.   Edit: of I'm you, I sell Hyde and ride the other three backs into the sunset. Take home this trophy, and sell off all your assets afterwards."
DynastyFF,3chfb3,akbfrosty,2,Wed Jul 8 00:46:26 2015 UTC,"He's win now because of the age of his guys, but I don't look at this team and think champion. I see playoff contender especially fighting a possible decline in the aging backs and lack of depth at WR.  Trading Hyde makes sense to put you more in a position to win with his value being really high right now. I'd target Emmanuel Sanders personally. Scored 20 a game in ppr last year and is the most ""win-now"" guy out there in my opinion."

DynastyFF,3chfb3,quickonthedrawl,2,Wed Jul 8 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty fair deal, I'd say. You seem low on Anderson, so I can understand why you'd want to do it. I see him as a good bet to be your best point scoring RB and he's 24, but that's just personal preference."

Given that your roster has Calvin, Jordy, Brees, and Olsen, you're virtually forced into a ""win now"" role or a fire sale. But you're very well positioned to make a run this year. C.J. Anderson should be an excellent piece to that.  He excelled last season, he's got a QB that historically boosts RB numbers to very high levels, and he's got a new head coach that has lifted RBs with very mediocre pedigrees into RB1 talents.  He's somewhere in my dynasty top 8 for RBs, but I'm not sure how much higher he settles in. Behind Bell, Gurley, and Lacy for sure. Maybe even on similar footing for me as Hill? That might be pushing it a little though."

DynastyFF,3cfmcb,Jesselock,3,Tue Jul 7 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"Ya I like this trade for you based on your team needs. You do need to get younger at WR so this does you a solid. You will have some question marks at running back which some things will have to fall your way, like Crowell, Sims and maybe even Ellington (I own all 3 as well). I like Abdullah and think he will be used this year with maybe Rb2 upside. None the less though by doing this trade you obviously realize you have to go younger and this does that for you at the cost of being a stronger team this year, you are a stronger team for more years."
DynastyFF,3cfmcb,Cavemansol,3,Tue Jul 7 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good trade for you, but I'd immediately start looking to sell VJax/Wright/Crabtree for as much RB help as you can get, or even better 2016 1sts (RB class next year looks stacked...)"

DynastyFF,3cfiyy,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"Well... the 'ideal dynasty team' would be able to win a champioinship with all it's players under 25 and be competitive for 5-6 years or so. Everyone tries to get the next Megatron or AP so a lot of the rookie hype is just not wanting to miss out on the next breakout because that's the dynasty jackpot. But the thing is you have to speculate a little in Dynasty and so the top prospects always go very high because people are factoring in where they see their cieling often moreso than their floor into their price. The NFL is littered with high round busts. Actually a rookie 1st only has about a 30% chance of being a stud.  The good lucky guys will win huge if their picks pan out. Otherwise it can be quite crippling. It just depends on what strategy you want to use in a startup. Picking rookies early has huge risk, but also huge reward."
DynastyFF,3cgwv1,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Tue Jul 7 20:39:32 2015 UTC,Did you mean get 2016 2nd? Otherwise why would you know one pick number and not the other for 2015?

DynastyFF,3cgwv1,MrCarlosDanger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:54:33 2015 UTC,No worries. In that case I wouldn't. Your team looks like it could break good or bad during the season and no one at 2.05 is going to change that. I would hate to trade what could possibly be a high 1st next year for a non key player for your team for this year.
DynastyFF,3cgwv1,MrCarlosDanger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:06:54 2015 UTC,Well the guy I would be trading with is in full rebuild this season. He has maybe 2 or 3 startable players but has stockpiled picks and young prospects. I suspect he will be towards the bottom of the league so the 2nd should be pretty high.
DynastyFF,3cgwv1,williajm121,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:22:45 2015 UTC,Still not worth it to me. Your team has some great pieces but just doesn't look super dominant. I don't count on any of those players listed to be significantly better than any of your starters so giving up a future first just isn't a good proposition to me.
DynastyFF,3cgwv1,PaoloPWD,2,Tue Jul 7 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"Don't give up your first round picks so easily, that 2016 1st is the most valuable piece in this deal.  Your team is good, but not good enough that you can guarantee it will be a bottom 3-4 pick next year."

DynastyFF,3cgqlk,Phaentom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:19:07 2015 UTC,It's important to know how many teams and what your starting rosters will be.  With the limited info given I would say Gronk is absolutely the #1 overall pick. I wouldn't worry so much about your 2nd TE but I would try and grab some upside guys like Hill or Cameron.  It really comes down to how many TEs you have to start compared to the other positions.
DynastyFF,3cgqlk,zadloo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"12 teams. start 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 superflex, 3 rb/wr/te flex"
DynastyFF,3cfrbv,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Although relying on Bradford is risky, if you think he will stay healthy it is a no brainer for me. In my eyes Cobb >> Calvin. Rivers = bradford to me, Bradford has high upside but high risk so it is about even. Roddy will help you more now than Oliver, if Oliver ever helps a team again. So I have Roddy > Oliver (slight bump though for handcuffing so could be even.)  The 2nd round pick in my opinion was needed so good job for seeing that and putting it in there. Was this offered to you or was it an offer you sent? If you are believing in Bradford then this is a super good trade for you in my eyes mainly because I have Cobb high on my list and Megatron is an aging asset (still valuable but wont be anymore valuable then he probably was last season). So ya I really like your side."
DynastyFF,3cfrbv,Jesselock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"It's a trade in considering proposing. Thanks for all your thoughts!   Edit: so you feel for sure Bradford gets the job over Sanchez,  right?"

DynastyFF,3cgkie,PaoloPWD,2,Tue Jul 7 19:58:21 2015 UTC,I see what you mean by a lack of depth it is your one weakness. I think Cooper has to be that second WR. I would consider A-Rob + Amari + McKinnon for Julio. Thats probably pretty close to fair. But I would see if he will add-in an extra RB.
DynastyFF,3cgkie,chiefst,3,Tue Jul 7 20:06:30 2015 UTC,Whats the infatuation with Mckinnon? I wouldn't value him as a 1st rounder at all. Mid second at best.
DynastyFF,3cgkie,gibbsftw,3,Tue Jul 7 20:54:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with both people here.  If HE is coming to YOU, make him PAY!  If you are talking 3 players that we haven't seen on an NFL field yet, I'd want Cooper, Gordon, his 1st next year, AND Coleman.  If he wants one of the top 3 dynasty assets right now, he's gonna have to pay.  I also agree that McKinnon doesn't hold much value.  I know you have AP, but McKinnon lost all value to me when AP came back.  AP will easily play 3 more years...if not more.  McKinnon is a 3 year stash considering that.  I'd ask for Cooper, Gordon, Arob, and McKinnon myself.  If he wants Julio bad enough, he will go for it.    Personally, I think you are one WR away from winning NOW.  If Quick plays like he did last year, he's that guy.  I'd be hesitant to trade Julio, although you could use a little depth.  Good luck."

Having Julio/Hopkins/Cooks lets you be competitive in almost every season, let alone that you have very strong RBs to complement them from day 1! Sucks missing out on your rookie picks next year but you got extra capital today for it. Not a total loss at all.  My advice would be to take no more DBs until the very end. You could use a rookie/sophomore RB or two since all your current RBs are on the same sort of career time frame. Otherwise, just keep doing you're doing!"

Depending on the strength of the league, there will always be values to be had later. I think its often better to spend less on three lower WR1's and let everyone else blow their load on OBJ. It's especially worthwhile to have an idea for your team direction. If Foster is stitting there for 10$ even tho he is old thats a steal for the level of production. IF OBJ is $120...while he might be your favorite player...thats not really worth it in the long run. If you think you can hold out and there will be value late then maybe spend more early. I think what that little budget there will be A SHIT LOAD of guys going for 1$...like a fuck ton if the roster is 50 players  Also a 50 person roster for a 12 team league with no IDP is insane haha."
DynastyFF,3cfids,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry I mis-typed I guess. The roster space is 21 but we have 50 contract years to use on those 21 players. So if i get Andrew Luck, I would sign him to a 5 year contract because that is the max. I would have 45 contracts left and 20 roster spots. But thanks for the advice, it will be useful."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,diggs12,3,Tue Jul 7 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"To give you an idea of what Julio is worth, I received Cooks, Hyde, a 2016 1st and 2 2016 2nd round picks. That was this offseason."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 7 15:28:47 2015 UTC,That's fair value I think.  Asked for two he initially offered plus 3 1st as a minimum.  Will see what he says.
DynastyFF,3cf3am,Vacar,2,Tue Jul 7 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Unless his pick is top 3, would need two more 1sts on that one.  Ingram is around a mid 2nd, Twills is prolly like a mid 3rd. 1,2,3 for Julio is a joke 1,1,2,3 is still not 100% on value for a top 5 (Top 3 in my book) WR. I would like be holding him unless im major major majorly rebuilding"
DynastyFF,3cf3am,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 7 12:34:03 2015 UTC,I have Ingram at the 1.07-1.12 range. Williams is around mid to late 2nd for me.
DynastyFF,3cf3am,LincolnSteve,3,Tue Jul 7 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"I would be stoked to get 1.07->12 for Ingram, I would take that all day."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The current average 1.07 pick is Yeldon, who is going at #71 in start-ups, while Ingram is going at #65.  Duke Johnson is going at 1.12 in rookie drafts and is coming in around #95 in start-ups. It looks like pick 1.07 would be fair value if you wanted a rookie instead of a vet, but anything lower and you are giving up value, especially at 1.12."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,LincolnSteve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:15 2015 UTC,Startup value is a bit different IMO. I think offering the 1.07 owner Ingram in most leagues will get an insta reject.
DynastyFF,3cf3am,slodanslodan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"The great thing about startup ADP is that it sets everything equal. It even dampens some, but not all of the rookie hype since everyone is getting brand new shiny toys.     If someone had offered me 1.07 this year for him I would have been tempted to take it, but only in-draft and knowing who was available with the pick."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,peckx063,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Well I have two stars in gronk and Julio. Agree with both comments regarding picks,  would have assumed 3 mid 1st  as a minimum."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 7 13:00:16 2015 UTC,I'd thank your trade partner for their consideration but let them know that their offer wasn't getting a counteroffer. The minimum ballpark offer that you would consider is 3 firsts where 1 of the firsts was early (1-4).
DynastyFF,3cf3am,heyfeefellskee,2,Tue Jul 7 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"For solely picks, it would be dependent on how good his team is, but I'd probably want his next three firsts and some seconds and thirds on top of it. 1,1,1,2,2,3,3 or something."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,aussiemac24,5,Tue Jul 7 12:39:06 2015 UTC,This seems a bit excessive... but I would certainly agree with the 3 1sts
DynastyFF,3cf3am,heyfeefellskee,3,Tue Jul 7 12:46:25 2015 UTC,I think it's totally fair for one of the top 3 dynasty assets.
DynastyFF,3cf3am,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:00:32 2015 UTC,Could be... All that matters is if someone in his league finds it fair
DynastyFF,3cf3am,heyfeefellskee,3,Tue Jul 7 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"It's not like Julio is someone he needs to get rid of. If someone is willing to pay what he wants--WIN. If not, he still has Julio--WIN."
DynastyFF,3cf3am,Jesselock,3,Tue Jul 7 13:07:58 2015 UTC,I would agree... I wish I had Julio! haha
DynastyFF,3cf5sc,aussiemac24,6,Tue Jul 7 12:56:42 2015 UTC,"A straight up trade for Cooks would make me cry tears of joy. Getting a talented 21 year old receiver who plays for drew brees, just for a 28 year old TE who now has a capped upside in SEA. This is easy, and I'd give up Graham for much less."
DynastyFF,3cf5sc,Dr_Lollygag,3,Tue Jul 7 13:17:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with Graham, but if Cooks/Green were offered to me I would give it some thought.  The problem is, both Cooks and Green are hyped up right now, and people (like you, maybe) are nervous about Graham, so it's not exactly a great time to sell graham or buy cooks/green."
DynastyFF,3cf5sc,heyfeefellskee,3,Tue Jul 7 13:06:21 2015 UTC,I recently traded Jimmy Graham for Brandin Cooks and his 2016 First. He really needed a TE.

DynastyFF,3cf3hs,_OneManArmy_,3,Tue Jul 7 12:32:14 2015 UTC,"Why the hell is everyone drafting Hyde so high?  I'm a 49ers fan, and this year it is certainly going to be a RBBC.  Sure he will get the most touches, but there's no way that Bush, Hunter, Davis, and Kap as a rushing QB will allow Hyde to get a ton of work in.  I doubt Bush lasts more then 2 years but if Hunter returns to form the 49ers will have the deepest backfield in the NFL, which is actually a problem for Hyde.  I'm high on him, but at his draft position I don't see any value.  We've drafted a RB in every draft for the last 5 years.  I just don't see the long term value.  What is your opinion on the 49ers backfield moving forward?"
DynastyFF,3cf3hs,lettuce,2,Tue Jul 7 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"Just found this sub today. I'm starting up a dynasty league this year and I'd like to know your thoughts on the various sites, since I haven't picked one yet. Are any particularly good for dynasty leagues? I searched through the recent posts and FAQ on this sub and didn't find anything."
DynastyFF,3cf3hs,username02,2,Tue Jul 7 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"In my opinion there are 3 options (that aren't the big box sites like ESPN, Yahoo, etc)  MyFantasyLeague. Probably the consensus #1 site here. It has a cost, but with a small league due ($10) you can cover the cost and have a small pot for the winner. It takes some getting used to, but it has been a positive experience so far.  FleaFlicker. Some people like this site (myself included) and others do not (most notably /u/Sticky_Z). It is free and I have yet to have any issues with the support staff. They have an FAQ that answers a fair amount of questions.  FanTrax. I know absolutely nothing of this site. Maybe someone else can speak more about it."
DynastyFF,3cf3hs,lettuce,2,Tue Jul 7 16:36:38 2015 UTC,"FleaFlicker is so painful, I wish NarFFL would move away from it.

DynastyFF,3cez59,linebackerlove54,7,Tue Jul 7 11:46:16 2015 UTC,Nice brag.  Obviously accept.  Also those coveted two open roster spots have me frothing.
DynastyFF,3cez59,peckx063,0,Tue Jul 7 12:18:21 2015 UTC,not a brag at all. more so worried about losing my bye week depth for one player who yes exploded last season but again it was just one season.

DynastyFF,3cez59,quickonthedrawl,4,Tue Jul 7 13:18:28 2015 UTC,saw you posting about bye week depth! Thats literally the last thing on my list when doing a roster. This is dynasty! Bye weeks do change every year :P. Nice trade
DynastyFF,3cez59,gibbsftw,0,Tue Jul 7 13:22:19 2015 UTC,yeah i try and think of too much in regards to fantasy. if youve seen the league im a none dick version of ruxin with all of his tinkering and back and forth with his lineup.
DynastyFF,3cez59,aussiemac24,3,Tue Jul 7 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"You've got ~6 of the consensus first round startup picks already, so to be perfectly honest, you should know the answer to your question already!"
DynastyFF,3cez59,RouxBalls,0,Tue Jul 7 12:07:54 2015 UTC,my worry was more so about losing my bye week depth. I know according to all of the ranking sites that OBJ is a top 10 and in most cases a top 5 dynasty pick.
DynastyFF,3cez59,RouxBalls,3,Tue Jul 7 13:17:44 2015 UTC,I'm sorry...but do you manage 4 of the teams in this league?  You would be trading peanuts for OBJ.  Your league mates don't seem to know what they are doing.
DynastyFF,3cez59,dumbname2,0,Tue Jul 7 14:00:59 2015 UTC,nope just my one team. its a group of guys from an online nfl forum site
DynastyFF,3cez59,doodwhersmycar,2,Tue Jul 7 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"Don't look back, you have to do this! Even if you don't want OBJ, you could turn around and sell him for more than you paid.  EDIT: How many teams are in your league??"
DynastyFF,3cez59,heyfeefellskee,0,Tue Jul 7 12:44:25 2015 UTC,12 team league. we are heading into our 4th year and ive just gotten lucky in the draft. First season I got luck RG3 and picked up Kaepernic and traded luck and kaepernic away to teams that wanted the youth and they paid alot to get the Qb's.
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,Ballinandfallin,3,Tue Jul 7 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"It all depends on who you're drafting.  I know it's hindsight now, but Tavon Austin was a 5'8, 174 lb receiver... what the heck did people expect to happen?    In my opinion, the ""safe"" guys for this draft are;  QB - Winston  RB - Gurley, Gordon, David Johnson.  If you are interested in a COP back type, then Abdullah and Duke Johnson  WR - Cooper, Parker, Agholor.    If the players I just listed busted I would be surprised."
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,PHV,2,Tue Jul 7 05:09:47 2015 UTC,"Would you take Parker over Perriman? Y u no like Kevin White. Srsly, I'd like to hear your take."
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,ThatsMrJerkFaceToYou,2,Tue Jul 7 05:53:16 2015 UTC,"Kevin White needs to learn to run a lot more routes. Cutler has said he's competing for the 4th WR spot and they are only teaching him about 6 basic routes this season.  On the other hand, Cooper is already established as the Raider's #1 and is absorbing multiple WR positions. I'm not going to compare White to Parker or Agholor because I don't want to put myself in a position to defend either of them. Personally, I like White far more than either of those guys.  But there are very legit concerns to have about White, even if you choose to look past them, like I do."
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,thefadd,2,Tue Jul 7 07:36:46 2015 UTC,"Bro, it's so early in the season and White is a rookie for a coach who is famous for not utilizing rookies, but his potential is absurd. I just don't see Cutler's statement as an indictment on White's play, but more so on the fact that he has work to do. Keep in mind, Dez and DT both needed at least a full year to begin to reach their potential. We're they bad investments? Hell no. We're in a developmental game where this kind of stuff needs to be taken into consideration. And, if you think Parker is ready for the pros, White is ready for the pros."
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,swoodmanroxu,2,Tue Jul 7 10:39:11 2015 UTC,No indictment of White. I have the same concerns for Parker -- and more because of the foot.
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,thefadd,2,Tue Jul 7 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"Just not sold on him.  Only did it for 1 year, don't think he can routinely separate from defenders.  MAYBE he'll be good, but i'm more confident in the others."
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,PHV,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:24:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would help OP to kbow that these are not safe picks either, just your faves. I don't like Gordon, David Johnson, or Agholor at thier current startup or rookie dract ADPs.  We also absolutely do not know how Abdullah and Duke will be used longterm, just beat writer speculation and coac-speak mostly at this point.   I think its best to evaluate on a player to player basis rather than looking for a trend; trust your self as an evaluator ."

DynastyFF,3cdxa8,wolf_nipple_chips,3,Tue Jul 7 12:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think you guys still have a redraft mindset about risk/reward. In dynasty imagine in you drafted LT when he was a rookie? Imagine if you drafted Mega as a rookie? You are locking down the potential of elite production for YEARS. I'm not saying Gordon is LT, but what if he is near that level? Sure you can go out and draft the 29 year old Charles over Gordon and you will have a few good years...but getting Gordon at 23 gives you 6 (6!!!!) more years of possible production. Grabbing a rookie is totally worth it when trying to build a dynasty. Especially from the ground floor. If he has a baller year his price will sky rocket past 1.03 (look at Evans/Cooks for example)  Just as a note, if you are in a beginner league or a league with a bunch of converts, sure Charles is going to hold a shit load more value today."
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,Sticky_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:31:17 2015 UTC,I guess I'm trying to evaluate the potential vs risk.  I always see you post and I'm wondering if you've played many years? What picks have you made in the past?
DynastyFF,3cdxa8,Sticky_Z,2,Tue Jul 7 11:55:06 2015 UTC,"I've played for 3 years now, but in a ton of leagues so I've made a lot of picks. One league I had yall's mindset,  I drafted BMarsh, Reggie Bush, Gerhart, Steven Jackson, and Dennis Pitta in a league and thought I had some sexy Vet RB's and a stud WR (at the time)....yeah look how that turned out. Now I punt RB for the most part and take young upside guys.  I passed on OBJ in a league 5 times, but having 1.02 and selecting Evans in that league has turned me into a contender from a complete rebuild. There also will always be players that value youth more than you do, so take those guys and trade em."

DynastyFF,3cedv9,thefadd,3,Tue Jul 7 06:52:48 2015 UTC,"Lee by a wide margin. I've posted it before here but I don't see the hype on huff at all. I think it all comes from ""he played for chip in college and he's fast"". He looks like nothing more than a return man to me at this point, even in OTAs there are reports that he can't consistently catch. In my opinion I think he's not vying for the #3 job, I think he's fighting for #4 and Ajirotutu will be stealing snaps from him at that point. When you add in sproles, ertz, and the fact that both the Eagles top 2 backs are great pass catchers I don't see Huff doing anything at all. Maybe he matures into more of an actual WR in the future but as of now I've seen nothing to indicate that he has any use."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,Brandnewbaseboards,3,Tue Jul 7 11:59:06 2015 UTC,"Lee has more opportunity for a team that may be playing from behind a lot. I like his potential to hit as a PPR option over Huff, who might be vying for a number three spot in what is going to be a run heavy attack."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,swoodmanroxu,2,Tue Jul 7 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"To give you some perspective, in a 24 team startup draft (full IDP, 10 keepers from base team), Marquise Lee went at the top of round 4 (pick 77), and Josh Huff was not drafted till late round 9 (pick 210).  That's the perceived gap in my league."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,dudhunter,3,Tue Jul 7 12:53:35 2015 UTC,That's about 8 rounds higher than Lee has gone in all the startups I've seen.
DynastyFF,3cedv9,heyfeefellskee,2,Tue Jul 7 13:09:47 2015 UTC,You have to take the 240 keepers into account.

DynastyFF,3cedv9,heyfeefellskee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:29:41 2015 UTC,"He also said ""10 keepers from base team"" so Lee went in the 14th and Huff in the 19th, not nearly the difference of 4th and 9th which would be ridiculous for either of them."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,heyfeefellskee,2,Tue Jul 7 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"yea... like i already said, that makes much more sense."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,atonyatlaw,0,Tue Jul 7 16:32:28 2015 UTC,Do you? He said it was a startup.
DynastyFF,3cedv9,heyfeefellskee,2,Tue Jul 7 15:21:02 2015 UTC,"Lee had a higher pedigree coming out of college, but there's quite a few more question marks around the Jags offense. I do believe Huff will be used in the Eagles offense quite a bit, so if I had to pick one I would say Huff for now."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,JoshNipples,2,Tue Jul 7 13:11:48 2015 UTC,I'd prefer Lee.   With Huff it feels like its only a matter of time before he is irrelevant. While at least Lee is in the mix and has a decent opportunity to be a long term starter.   So much depends up on Blake Bortles though.
DynastyFF,3cedv9,peckx063,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:33:47 2015 UTC,"Lee AINEC.  He won't ever develop into an elite player, but has a sensationally high floor that will leave him in the WR3, maybe WR2 in PPR range for a long time."
DynastyFF,3cedv9,peckx063,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:29:17 2015 UTC,Okay but where do you get the high floor from? It seems to me that Hurns or Greene could be perfectly qualified to turn him into the third or fourth option behind Robinson and Thomas.

DynastyFF,3cbwdc,HerroCorumbia,3,Tue Jul 7 14:31:17 2015 UTC,FWIW your team so far looks far better than my first dynasty draft. Glad to have ya in the league.
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,Vacar,5,Tue Jul 7 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"If someone showed me one-thousand teams and told me to pick yours out of the bunch I bet I could do it.  That's not meant as an insult at all. These teams always end up looking really solid for a long-term dynasty. Youth is your #1 priority which is ideal for the perfect dynasty team in the future.  You mentioned that you disliked the 1.12 spot, but it actually worked out just fine for you. To utilize this nicely, you need to be able to trade when you feel is necessary -- which is exactly what you did.  You got two of my favorite players in Watkins and Hopkins, who are both young and should easily produce low-end #1 WR seasons next year. Three solid WR prospects in Robinson, Adams, and Parker. Along with a young potential #1 RB in Yeldon. I'd say your team looks like a lock for a dynasty starting in 2016/2017.  I'm not high on Robinson, Adams, or Yeldon, but to each his own. You drafted well."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,Biggie2207,8,Tue Jul 7 00:12:20 2015 UTC,Thanks dude. I always like seeing your thought processes here so I definitely take it as a compliment. I find I like my teams much more when I give myself a year or two to develop the prospects before jumping into title contention.
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,Biggie2207,3,Tue Jul 7 00:23:01 2015 UTC,Scrolling through....hey this looks like my draft....wait this is my draft lol
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,thefadd,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"Haha, yep. Your team is sweet too. Young but competitive immediately so far. Really disappointed I wasn't in position to take Cooper."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,detphi1,2,Tue Jul 7 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the time I wasn't sure about the pick but I'm happy with it now. No one is untradeable. If teddy pans out ill be sitting pretty"
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,ireddit2too,2,Tue Jul 7 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"Nice job getting Robinson and coming back around for Adams. I prefer Abdullah over Yeldon (especially at the cost) but very well played by you, getting who you want.

DynastyFF,3cbwdc,udeuce,3,Mon Jul 6 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"By the time I was on the clock at 5.05, I was really thankful that Adams hadn't been snagged already. To be honest I think I should have taken him over Parker, but it ended up working out in the end.  I'll be curious to see how the mid-late rounds go. So far, the other GMs have been pretty sharp, but it's definitely not like the hardest /r/dynastyff leagues I've done. I'm hoping to scoop up some premium prospects later."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,udeuce,2,Mon Jul 6 21:01:53 2015 UTC,What kind of Quarterbacks are you targeting late and about when?
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,udeuce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"Don't want to give too much away since a few league mates are here, but I'll say I'll probably be looking for 2 QBs to platoon in the round 14-18 range. If I end up reaching on a younger one earlier (a guy like Winston, Carr, et al), I'll probably take the second one a little later than 18.  Definitely have no problems with the bottom feeders at my QB slot. Worst case scenario, I can spend future 2nds and future 3rds as needed to patch together a solid QBBC every year."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,ireddit2too,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"I'm digging your team, man. Sucks you missed out on Mike Evans. Yeldon is an underrated dynasty asset in my eyes. I'd take him over Gordon any day.    WR1 - Hopkins: This is his year! Wishing for a QB upgrade in the coming years. WR2 - Watkins: love the talent here. He fits the Bills so well. Same as Hopkins though, hoping for a QB upgrade in the coming years. WR3 - Allen Robinson: Crowded WR group, but Robinson is talented and has a higher ceiling compared to Lee and Hurns. WR4 - Adams: Top dynasty asset. Just waiting on Jordy to leave. Solid FLEX option though. WR5 - Parker - No. 1 WR in Miami with Tannehill still growing. RB1 - Yeldon, my favorite RB in this class besides Gurley. He'll be one of the top dynasty RBs next year.    All five of the players should see an increase in their value after this upcoming season."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,accessgranter,5,Mon Jul 6 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   All five of the players should see an increase in their value after this upcoming season.   Nailed it! That's the plan. In fact, that gets at my core goal in startup drafts: Spend my draft capital such that in years 1 and 2, my team overall has the max value possible, regardless of how competitive it is. Then I can shift into ""win now"" or ""win later"" easiest."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,thewhatwhatbutt,5,Mon Jul 6 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"This is a great comment, and I would like to create more dynasty theory discussion like this in the sub. I've tried to reason out the benefits of drafting win now vs. win later, but I also like your concept of drafting to maximize value and getting a feel for your team before transitioning into whichever stage you feel is best. Gives a lot more flexibility to the roster post-draft."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,Zilveari,3,Mon Jul 6 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I would love more theorycrafting! To be honest, that's my favorite part of FF and of drafting."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,Zilveari,2,Mon Jul 6 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed theorycrafting is crucial! There's so much content produced for FF and it's almost exclusively about the players/sport of football. I know that FF is gambling to some degree, but I truly believe it's predominantly a game of skill. The odd part is that most of the content focuses on the luck aspect of FF (the players) while very little of it is written about the things under your control! Roster construction, window to compete, consolidation of assets, waiver wire tactics, all of these things are completely skill dependent and have a huge effect on FF."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,accessgranter,3,Mon Jul 6 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's the redraft mentality that so many people can't break free from? Not to mention, a vast majority of FF content is redraft-centric anyway. The guys at Under the Helmet do a pretty good job of discussing roster construction, but otherwise, I don't see much of it at all anywhere else but here."
DynastyFF,3cbwdc,heyfeefellskee,3,Tue Jul 7 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"I would agree most content is geared toward redraft, even comparing the reddit subs' subscribers shows the difference in popularity. I would like to see more content about even redraft roster construction and consolidation. I still see so many people trade away stars for two reasonably good players, or keep a bench full of players who are decent yet have no upside. Depth is ideal in redraft, but I would say it's far more important to have top tier starters at the cost of a depleted bench if you intend to go far in the playoffs. Anyway that was a tangent but I've always wondered if other people think this way and I'm looking at creating content to further this type of discussion!"

My dynasty team is pretty bad.  We have had three seasons and I've not finished in the top 5 out of 12 once.  I did get Aaron Rodgers and Gronk in our startup draft 3 years ago though.  And got Julius Thomas two years ago.    Right now I have Rodgers, Forsett, Emmanuel Sanders, OBJ, Gronk, Orange Julius, Reggie Bush, Daniel Herron, Torrey Smith, Mike Williams, BJ Cunningham, Alex Smith, Mason Crosby, Antone Smith, Knowshon Moreno.

DynastyFF,3ce10z,Paintball26,2,Tue Jul 7 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"Next year as in 2015 season or 2016 season? I don't think you're in a position to compete just yet, but if your rookie and 2nd year WRs break out, you might have a shot in 2016.   However, you're basically weak everywhere except for your core of young WRs. If 5-6 of your WRs (say, Cooper, White, Adams, Robinson, and Funchess) explode like the rookies did last year, you might be able to trade 1 or 2 of them, plus aging assets, for a couple young high end RBs. Then you'll possibly be in a good enough position to overcome your weaker QBs and TEs."
DynastyFF,3ce10z,blardorg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"I meant in the 2016 season. I guess I should also begin taking a look at who my options are next year, as I should have 2 picks in the 1.01-1.06 range in the 2016 draft. I know that there is Talented RB/WRs in 2016 and 2017 is going to be stacked at top end RB talent as of right now.  Thank you for your response"
DynastyFF,3ce10z,ButSeri0usly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"I would start looking to see what you can get for some handcuffs. Starks might help you if were competing this year and Lacy went down but he is never going to take over while Lacy is healthy. Michael may or may not get the starting job but is definitely worth more to the Marshawn owner than he is to you. With each passing year, I think it is more likely that Seattle will just draft a new RB when Marshawn is done. Helu might have a good season if he beats out Latavius but I personally don''t see that happening. I think Helu's value decreases after the season starts.   I would probably look to package all of your RBs in some way with the exception of Langford and Robinson. They are the only ones who were recently drafted with the RB in front of them having a short contract.   If you keep the WR corps intact, you should be able to compete down the road. Getting as much young talent and draft picks as you can is paramount. Draft picks are better bargaining chips than average players because people see potential in draft picks and see deficiencies in average players. If you can get some assortment of 1sts and 2nds for your RBs and Brady, you might be able to swing a trade for a talented young RB who has a secure job."
DynastyFF,3ce10z,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think you might need one extra year before you're ready. Cooper, Adams, White, Robinson and Funchess is a pretty sweet WR corps, but it's going to struggle in 2015. They might be strong enough for the playoffs in 2016, but you wouldn't be anywhere close to the favorite.  You're right that you need to add a RB, but mostly it's that you need to rotate in different RBs. If you're not competing until 2016 or 2017, Forsett is worthless to you, and Ellington is pretty bad too. I would probably suggest shopping them to impatient franchises for 2nd/3rd round guys from this year. David Johnson, Duke Johnson, Matt Jones, etc."
DynastyFF,3ce10z,heyfeefellskee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:05:46 2015 UTC,I don't think you are competing this year. I would sit tight as you have some young prospects that could develop well.
DynastyFF,3cd3jo,blamityblam,4,Mon Jul 6 23:46:07 2015 UTC,I hate both your trades. QB is definitely your biggest draft need.
DynastyFF,3cd3jo,Brandnewbaseboards,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:01:07 2015 UTC,i figured i was trading from depth.  I am not super satisfied with them but atleast i got a borderline rb 1 out of it.  I mean Mason was my rb 2 last year and his work load is in extreme question now
DynastyFF,3cd3jo,joshhorn8,3,Tue Jul 7 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the Charles Johnson + 2.09 for McKinnon + 2.04 move, but Hilton + Landry + 1.09 for McCoy was awful.  Sell Knile Davis to the Jamaal Charles owner. Sell Tre Mason to the Todd Gurley owner. Sell Ryan Matthews to the Demarco Murray owner.  In a 10 team league, I'm not worried about QB at all. You can piece together decent QB play off the WW if you have to. I'm betting that's where you got Carson Palmer last year and he was on QB8 pace before his injury.  I'd want a lot more young WRs on the roster and a lot fewer RBs. I like Gio and McKinnon of your RBs. Forte and McCoy are purely short-term plays, but I think you have a decent shot to win this year, so that's fine.  Blackmon will be a drop come rookie draft time I think, barring some breaking news about his suspension. It is looking more and more likely like he will never play football again."
DynastyFF,3cd3jo,LincolnSteve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback man.  Yeah I am def in win now mode. I tried to move davis and mason.

If he isn't then I would stay at 1.02 and take Cooper, then come back with Yeldon or Parker at the 1.06  If he is taking taking Cooper, I would take the Cooks deal, take Parker at 1.06, Abdullah at 1.10, then possibly trading back a few spots in the 2nd round to try and pick up an additional 3rd rounder and taking Funchess or Dorsett then Buck Allen, Langford or CAP in the 3rd depending on where the pick is"
DynastyFF,3cdqaa,maddenite,3,Tue Jul 7 03:07:35 2015 UTC,The first overall is almost guaranteed to take Gurley.  Unless he gets a killing for the pick he won't move.  So I like my chances at 1.02 for cooper.    I did trade away my third round pick in a deal for Moncrief. I do like the talent falling in the third and am looking to require a pick there too.
DynastyFF,3cdqaa,maddenite,2,Tue Jul 7 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Moncreif for a 3rd sounds like steal if that was the trade  If he's taking Gurley then I would sit tight and take Cooper. If you believe in your RBs then I would take Parker at the 1.06 if he's there. If you feel like you need some more assurance at the RB position, Yeldon should be there at the 1.06  Especially with it being a standard scoring league, I would put Yeldon and Parker about even at the 1.06"
DynastyFF,3cdqaa,aussiemac24,2,Tue Jul 7 03:48:22 2015 UTC,Thanks I'm feeling kinda the same. Cooper/parker would be ideal. I would even take a third WR in the 2nd. I'm confident in finding RB value later
DynastyFF,3cdqaa,aussiemac24,3,Tue Jul 7 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"Is this league PPR? If so, I feel like you have to take that cooks trade. Get a proven top 15 WR plus you could still get Yeldon and Parker in the draft."
DynastyFF,3cdqaa,thefadd,2,Tue Jul 7 03:29:29 2015 UTC,Standard league. If it was PPR I would definitely be all over it.
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,Commando_Elite,4,Mon Jul 6 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Two QB but only 8 teams...interesting. You have the market cornered on TE's so I'd maintain that strength with Gronk and Graham. That's 2.  Your next best asset is for sure Hopkins so he's #3.  The last spot goes to Megatron, Cooks, or Russell Wilson. I'm inclined to say your hand is forced because you start 2 QB's but I'm not so sure. Since you have picks 1, 16, and 17, I'd want to know more about the league.  Obviously Luck and Rodgers will be kept. It's also only 4 pts per TD and only you know just how valued QB's tend to be in your league. If dropping Wilson is going to screw you, you have to hold him. My bet is that at worst you could drop him and grab 2 solid QB's at 16/17 (at worst).  Otherwise it's Calvin Johnson vs Cooks and Johnson gets the ever so slight edge to be #4."
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,thefadd,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:40 2015 UTC,We tried to add enough starters into the lineup to keep it from being a lame 8 team.  It worked out ok I think.    It is nice that I will have first pick in the draft hoping somebody screws up.  I get that it's dynasty but is Cooks really that close to Megatron?
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,thefadd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:42:27 2015 UTC,True -- with Gronk and Graham you're in win now mode so definitely Megatron.
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,jdr393,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:48:15 2015 UTC,Megatron has 1-2 more highly productive years. Hopkins could be a stud for the next 7.
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,thefadd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:29:54 2015 UTC,True -- you're win-now with Gronk and Graham so go Megatron no doubt.
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,quickonthedrawl,3,Tue Jul 7 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"Nice dilemma to have, since you have some talent.  Russell Wilson and Rob Gronkowski are automatics. They're both consensus first rounders in 2 QB formats. I like Hopkins best of your WRs, so he probably makes the cut.  Do you know your draft pick yet for the ""startup"" draft? That might influence my choice as to whether Stafford or Cooks is better, since I think I prefer both to Graham or Kelce (even in 2 TE)"
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yea I will have 1, 16, 17, 32,33...  I'm not sure how early to start drafting with this format either"
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,joshhorn8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"In that case, I would definitely take Cooks as the fourth guy, since you'll have the first overall pick to get back Stafford or a better QB if someone doesn't keep him."
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,Therealcodyg,3,Mon Jul 6 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"For being an 8 team league, these are some pretty cool rules.   Gronk Wilson Graham Kelce Hopkins Cooks   You're in a pretty sweet spot for a 2QB/2TE league. Like some others have noted, you're close to cornering the TE market, which is one of the big reasons I pushed both Graham and Kelce into your top 4.  Personally, with the 1.01 coming your way, I think you should go ahead and keep all three tight ends. I know it sounds nuts, but you have the top 3 dynasty TEs at the moment. For a position with as much scarcity as TE, that is a huge advantage, even if it leaves you a little weak at other positions. Picking up a 2nd QB shouldn't be too tough, and lucky for you the top-end WR tier has swelled pretty dramatically in the past year."
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,ireddit2too,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"This was my exact thought. Keep all three TEs, then choose either Hopkins or Cooks. I'd personally lean towards Cooks, but he can't go wrong either way.   He can grab the 5th guy (Hopkins, Megatron, Wilson) with pick 1.01 if there aren't better options."

We are doing 4 keepers this year with our draft including rookies then transitioning to dynasty and doing only rookies next year.    I'm thinking with 16 starting TEs I should keep 2 TEs (Gronk/Graham) to get the biggest advantage over my opponents.    After those 2 I'm thinking Megatron and D. Hopkins.  Does that seems right or should I go a different  direction with it changing to dynasty?   I also have the first pick in Rookie/FA draft so I will be picking at 1, 16, 17, 32, 33..."
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,Vacar,2,Mon Jul 6 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"Gronk, Hopkins, Cooks and Megatron. Easily.   Edit with 2 TE - you could swap Megatron for Graham."
DynastyFF,3cbyvr,Btk88,2,Mon Jul 6 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"keeping a qb doesn't seem like the right move, almost assuredly no one in the league is going to keep both of their qbs and their will be a ton of talent left in the first round so your wrapper picks could be used for a top 10 qb.  gronkowski is the only ""lock"" IMO. Hopkins, Cooks, Jimmy G, Megatron, Peterson, and Wilson seem to be where the decision comes in. But don't sleep on Kelce he's going to catch 80+ balls this season.   You have enough that you should be able to package a trade and get a top 3 PPR RB. So my strategy would be to keep Gronk target a top PPR RB and keep who you have left over after the trade."

DynastyFF,3cbyvr,PaoloPWD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"Gronk, Hopkins, and Wilson are the easy three. Even though it's 2QB, it's a small league, so I wouldn't bother to hold Stafford. For the last spot, it's between Calvin, Cooks, Graham, and Kelce for me, depending on exactly how you think each of them will do for the next few years.

DynastyFF,3cccq9,XanderMatrix,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:46 2015 UTC,I think this is a solid move.
DynastyFF,3cccq9,JoshNipples,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:09:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. We ultimately settled on Spiller for his 2.05 (I selected David Johnson) and his second next year (along with some late round swaps) which is pretty even for both of us I think!
DynastyFF,3cccq9,PaoloPWD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:11:12 2015 UTC,You aren't competing this year most likely so I think its a good trade for you. I feel you could sell the Spiller hype a little more.

DynastyFF,3ccz6i,jssports12,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Here are the scoring settings for my new league. Includes bonuses for yardage totals and big plays, etc."
DynastyFF,3ccz6i,frahmer86,2,Tue Jul 7 01:36:28 2015 UTC,After many years of tinkering I think this league of mine has the most balanced scoring I've ever seen.   I also wrote a piece here detailing a less extreme version that still has a pretty good balance
DynastyFF,3ccwn8,elpaisita,2,Mon Jul 6 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"You definitely need help at RB, I'm pretty high on Miller. I'd take it"
DynastyFF,3ccwn8,fropek,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"I personally think Miller will be Miami's RB1, with at least as good usage as last year when he finished as a top 12 RB. That's a lot more valuable than Floyd, especially in non-PPR."
DynastyFF,3ccwn8,blardorg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:10:23 2015 UTC,Make this deal happen.  Miller is better value

DynastyFF,3cb3j3,fropek,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"<3 Tackle Heavy leagues. Big play is like having bonus yards on O. Give me points for what they do on every play, not the random game with 5 sacks cause the O line is tissue paper."
DynastyFF,3cb3j3,Sticky_Z,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"Agree, but playing the matchups correctly can yield amazing results.   It's tough to lose when you have a guy that puts up 40 points."
DynastyFF,3cb3j3,Sticky_Z,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:58:02 2015 UTC,Yeah had that same thought after I posted. I think big play kinda leans towards Redraft a bit im my mind. Playing the matchups and hoping for the one big game. It can change your season pretty quickly to win one week. Dynasty (especially value) is tied to the surer thing.
DynastyFF,3cb3j3,Easterling,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:26:53 2015 UTC,My scoring system in IDP  Do you think its good? Or should I tweek some things. Most of my league likes it because it gives high importance to the IDP players instead of only being a complement.
DynastyFF,3cb3j3,Sticky_Z,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:54:30 2015 UTC,Thats solid. I love the tackle numbers. What site is that from?

DynastyFF,3ccp4h,LastOfTheOsirans,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"I lock it immediately after the Super Bowl, this allows for the draft to include more veterans whose values are increased during the offseason and lets teams prioritize rookies vs veterans with actual value during the draft. It's makes it a little more random/fun.   We unlock it the week after the draft so that people have time to settle in to their rosters/make trades."
DynastyFF,3ccp4h,Theczarcasticone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"I lock it after the super bowl and turn it on at various times for different leagues depending on what the members want. Some leagues do special waiver periods after OTA's and during preseason. Its all about preference really. You want to make sure that the rookie draft is a decent length where super talented guys are just hanging on the wire..unless thats what the league wants haha. Its important that they arent on year round, that can cause some weird interactions with people not glued to the site. I think a must is turning it on during training camp and a super limit is preseason. You want to make it fun for people to fight over those guys blowing up in camp that didnt get drafted in the rookie."
DynastyFF,3ccp4h,Sticky_Z,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly across all my leagues it's different in almost all of them. I have one that is unlocked year round. I have a couple that are locked between the Super Bowl and the draft. I have a couple that are locked a little bit longer after the draft but open up for preseason.  I like having a little bit of time between the end of the draft and the start of free agency, like 1-2 weeks or so."
DynastyFF,3car83,iowahawkeyes95,7,Mon Jul 6 13:10:25 2015 UTC,"For my team I would drop Harvin and keep Allen Robinson for sure.  I'm not even that high on Robinson but he should score a whole helluva lot more points than Harvin. I LOVE Robinson as a WR4.  As far as your other keepers, I'd hang onto Teddy and Ben. Those are two starters. Helu and Knile are two backups. Knile has value as a handcuff, so I would not fault you for taking him over Teddy B.  But to me I'll take the guy who's a second year player and shown me a great first year.    1st pick should be Cooper. You can try Gurley if you want. They're close. I might try to trade Hilton for a RB. I get the feeling he's off to a new team in 2016...."
DynastyFF,3car83,chkessle,3,Mon Jul 6 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"In PPR, Robinson should be top 24. With the opportunity provided to him and even at the rate he was going as a rookie, Robinson has quietly become the best value play from last year's WR class."
DynastyFF,3car83,swoodmanroxu,5,Mon Jul 6 14:21:33 2015 UTC,I'd keep Robinson over Harvin very easily.
DynastyFF,3car83,Brad227,6,Mon Jul 6 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"Per rule #7: ""Please do not post any questions about your keeper league. This sub is strictly for dynasty leagues so if you consider it a keeper or are unsure ask before posting or your post will be deleted.""  Since some discussion has already started with your team I'll let it go though. It's really a shame how there isn't a quality subreddit for keepers, but that's the case. With 10 keepers it's getting close to emulating a dynasty league, but it's still clearly a keeper league.    In this case I'd keep Jones, Beckham Jr, Gronkowski, Hilton, Robinson, Newton, Hyde, Morris, Bridgewater, Davis.  In a 10 team league, QBs aren't too valuable so I don't feel you need to keep 3 of them. Helu is an immediate drop here, as is Harvin. It'd be nice to keep Crabtree, but I prefer Davis and Bridgewater."

DynastyFF,3car83,Vacar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"Sure! A dynasty league is when you have a lifelong commitment to all your players. You can keep them all, trade, or drop them into free agency. Your roster can essentially stay the same forever.  With a keeper league, you only have a temporary commitment to the players you have. In this specific league, only half of the players are kept meaning you can't wait for players to develop like you can in dynasty. A keeper league puts more of a focus on getting talent now, while ignoring upcoming prospects that won't pay dividends immediately.  Although both can be equally difficult and competitive, I've always preferred dynasty leagues because you never have to make these types of decisions in the post above.  Hope that helped!"
DynastyFF,3car83,waterninja,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"Oh that makes a lot of sense, so a keeper league is like a middle ground while a dynasty league is like running an actual team...thanks for the info!"

He did pretty well his rookie year in some key stats that show he will improve. The team got better around him and he has another year with Norv Turner.   Big Ben will have a good year for sure, but for how much longer?  If you want to keep 2 QBS, you can justify Bridgewater."

DynastyFF,3cbvem,CheckedCoffee05,2,Mon Jul 6 18:28:26 2015 UTC,Question:  If Randle doesn't pan out ( he is a big if in my mind) would you still take this deal?  Graham is a proven guy and still probably the #1 reciever on the seahawks.  He will still score atleast 8 TDs.  I would need more talent that I am sure on for a player of his caliber
DynastyFF,3cbvem,blamityblam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:26:59 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to fill in the blank. We need to know league format, size, starting requirements, and ideally both rosters."

DynastyFF,3cbf34,jad233,2,Mon Jul 6 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"I would feel OK getting him for a 3rd round pick in your situation, but I'd shoot for a 4th rounder normally."
DynastyFF,3cbf34,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 6 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'd go for a 3rd, if that guy has another QB. If he only has 1 he's gonna ask for more. Also pick up Sanchez if he's on the wire and you get Bradford."
DynastyFF,3cbf34,Santidreet,2,Mon Jul 6 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"Is Garoppolo on the waiver wire?  I think Bradford still has upside, but if you don't like the asking price you should look into Brady's replacement."
DynastyFF,3cbf34,bfro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:03:25 2015 UTC,Garoppolo is already taken. And he already rejected my offer of a 2016 3rd for Bradford.
DynastyFF,3cbf34,LincolnSteve,2,Mon Jul 6 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"In a 16 team league Bradford does have a little more value than standard 10-12 man leagues. The problem is scarcity if everyone has a backup QB (16x2)and Bradford theoretically is the starting QB for one of the top fantasy offenses that gives him some value. I'd say he's worth a late 2nd in your format, just understand there's a lot of risk there.   If you want to go cheap, why not try to ride Manuel until Brady returns? He's got a better supporting cast this year. Maybe he can provide some QB2 value and you can trade him to someone desperate when Brady returns."
DynastyFF,3cbf34,JoshNipples,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"Last I heard Bradford isn't healthy. Is there doubt he will be ready to play come the beginning of the season?   It would be a shame to make this move and still not have a QB.   My point is, I think Bradford is a player for teams who can take risks at QB, it sounds like you can't."
DynastyFF,3cbf34,LincolnSteve,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"He's about where he was in 2014 coming back from his last ACL. So, I guess on a positive note, he made it back for camp and pre-season last time at this pace. I'm not sure the Eagles rush him back quite as quickly as the Rams did though."
DynastyFF,3calyv,aussiemac24,2,Mon Jul 6 12:16:44 2015 UTC,"I would hold onto him. Someone else on this sub put it pretty well on a post from a day or two ago. Right now, Green has very little value. Give him Antonio's 4 week suspension, see what he does then reassess. At worst, he's just as valuable as he has been, maybe a little less. At best, you can ship him for a large haul. You also have Graham moving to a different offense and who knows what could happen there. There's no way he's not a top 5 TE, but I like having options with such deep benches."

There was a recent article on dynastyleague where several experts were polled about his value before and after Gates' suspension.   http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/2015/07/03/instant-analysis-antonio-gates-suspended/  1 guy said 1st rounder, a couple said 3rd rounder, and most said 2nd rounder."

Thats a small step above streamable. Offense is solid as well. Standard and good for dynasty. Taxi squads are up to you but its kind of going out of style imo. Why not just have more roster spots? Unless you have some rules to allow poaching its sort of more work for you to watch it. 4+ spots is prolly needed if you have IDP  Same advice I give everyone, make sure you have clear and concise  rules.

Don't underestimate his hands either...he's proven exceptionally well in the passing game.  I feel that this is just a case of rookie hype.  Sure, I like Abdullah to a degree and feel that CAP is a nice insurance for Carolina, but it's hard to write off a guy who's nearly guaranteed to get workhorse carries in Oakland.  I truly believe that Murray's hype is warranted...he's an exceptional RB product and should have the opportunity to finally shine."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,GI_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:09:42 2015 UTC,I'm mostly going off the fact that there aren't many 6th round RBs that have excelled to elite status at the pro level other than Terrell Davis and Mike Anderson both from the Bronco's that both had Shanahan coaching them. I just feel like for every positive thing I read about Latavius I read an equally negative thing. Time will tell.
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,PHV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"Ever hear of Alfred Morris, Ahmad Bradshaw, and Arian Foster, all 6th round or later guys.  Isaiah Crowell was also undrafted and looked pretty good last year, as well as Latavius Murray.  There's really no reason to hitch your wagon to a slow, 5'9, 205lb running back over Latavius Murray.  Having said all that, most people would probably trade Murray for a late 1st which is basically what you got in return, so value-wise the trade isn't bad at all."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,PHV,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"Morris I'll give you but he started as a rookie and also had Shanahan coaching him. Bradshaw has had only two seasons with over a thousand yards and is consistently injured and has never started 16 games in his entire career. Foster was the starter his second year in the league. Crowell (who I have on my team but am looking to trade) is far from elite and has not one but now two guys breathing down his neck. He also started four games as a rookie. Murray didn't start a single game as a rookie, was behind two aging veterans that he should have beat out this year, only started three games which maybe could've been four had he not been concussed. It also seems like he needs a lot of carries to get his yards. So for a team that could be playing catch up most of the time, I'm sorry but that just doesn't give me much confidence in the guy. You're acting like RBs drafted in the later rounds is a trend and if anything it's an anomaly."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,PHV,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"you missed the point.  the list I gave you is larger than the list of abdullah type lead backs.  and bradshaw was very good, just injury plagued."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,aussiemac24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"This is a ppr league, Abdullah doesn't have to be a lead back he just has to get RB2 numbers which he should be capable of doing in that offense. I'd rather the guy who was a second round pick for a high volume passing offense than a guy on the raiders. In the end we have no idea if Murray or Adbullah will ever be lead backs."

DynastyFF,3c9bwo,deadrabbits76,5,Tue Jul 7 16:55:54 2015 UTC,I think you won. I personally think raiders backfield will be major committee. Not sure this trade will really make our break your season though.
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,deRoyLight,3,Mon Jul 6 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"I would probably do this too. Though for how unproven Murray is, obviously Abdullah is even more so."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,peckx063,2,Mon Jul 6 02:46:37 2015 UTC,"Great trade. Granted, I hate the Raiders, but that rarely works against me."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,thewhatwhatbutt,2,Mon Jul 6 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent move. Murray can't stay healthy, isn't particularly bright and still runs very raw for all his physical gifts. Not to mention Helu is worlds better than him on passing downs and that will chomp away at his PPR value. Abdullah is a far superior player and a far safer player long-term to provide you value, especially in a PPR league. Abdullah's floor is much higher and his ceiling is higher as well. The addition of Artis-Payne is icing on the cake and sets you up with the potential to have two valuable RB assets heading into next season.    I'm not sure why everyone is sleeping on Artis-Payne's value. He's one of the better-odds backs to assume a significant role in the future. Stewart has never proven he can stay healthy, and even if he can he is heading into 2016 past his expiration as a RB. Payne will have every opportunity to compete for that job down the road."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,JoshNipples,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:17 2015 UTC,This is essentially why I made the deal.
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,Vacar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"A true battle of players I despise.  This will be tough to anoint a champion.  I'm going to start by simply eliminating Artis-Payne's value from the equation. Whatever it is, I'm sure the next best player available from free agency isn't far behind.  I don't think Ameer Abdullah can be a dependable feature back.  I think his speed and explosiveness are overstated and his size limits how effective he can be inside.  If I'm a defensive coordinator facing the Lions, I don't bat an eye about defending Abdullah.  My guys are fast enough and strong enough to stop him.  I'm not going to load the box. I'm not going to put in a sub package when he's out there. I'm going to play him straight up and tackle him.  Latavius Murray.  If you were any good why wouldn't you have been good already?  I must believe you were less impressive than Darren McFadden in practice. You had that one long td then they started playing you and you were pretty mediocre.  It kinda seems like the only thing you can do is run really fast and fall over immediately if someone touches you.  You're a role player aren't you? If they give you the ball 250 times it'll go pretty bad huh?  Winner: Fuck it.  The Raiders have locked themselves in to Murray and he's pretty fast and stuff.  I'll take him for perceived value odds and trade him when he drops another 90 yard run."
DynastyFF,3c9bwo,wolf_nipple_chips,4,Mon Jul 6 04:18:12 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with your assessment of Artis-Payne... He is not an amazing athlete, but he was a very successful between the tackles runner. He was a productive grinder in college. The main thing though, is that he is behind Jon 'Glassbones' Stewert. Multiple sources have said that Payne is the direct backup to Stewert, and that he would likely be a 3 down back... If (when) J. Stew goes down and Payne produces, there is value to be had."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,just_trizzy,9,Mon Jul 6 02:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'd take Gurley, Mason, and a 2016 first.  I wouldn't take Peterson.  I'd take Abdullah and Watkins. Edit: This is probably my favorite of the two.  I wouldn't take the final deal."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,quickonthedrawl,3,Mon Jul 6 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'd take the AP trade or the Watkins trade, and I'd consider the Gurley trade but I think Gurley's being overvalued right now since he's unlikely to play this season. You'll be able to get him for less in a few months.  The AP trade is notable in that it is OK for a competing team or a rebuilding team. The competing team makes a lateral move from a production standpoint and gets future picks to trade for more players or to soften their decline. The rebuilding team can flip AP for a young player or more picks.  The Watkins trade is purely a WR value play. Lacy's got another three seasons of high production, and a couple of those might not be with the Packers. Watkins is 22 and should play at a high level for another 7 or 8 seasons. This trade is situational and varies quite a bit based on starting requirements, so the vacuum may not be the best measure. Assuming 2FLEX means up to 4 RB or up to 4 WR, then I like the trade.  I don't like the Gurley trade too much. Gurley won't play (much) this season, but he is only 20. If you believe in him, it's a great point in his career to get him. Again, I think his value will fall during the course of the season. This is another trade that doesn't work well in a vacuum. It's hard to picture a team that likes Gurley and sundry more than they like Lacy. A competitor wants the production and a rebuild should really be getting longer-term assets unless they are positive they can flip Mason."

DynastyFF,3c9acd,LastOfTheOsirans,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'd take the AP trade because it lets you remain a championship contender while still increasing value.   The Watkins trade hurts you this season. You lose a ton of RB production for a nominal increase at WR/TE. While Graham would be a big upgrade, it wouldn't be as big as your downgrade at RB. If you don't think that your team can compete, then the second deal has more overall value. You'll need to aggressively sell Graham and Fitz/VJax which shouldn't be too hard."

DynastyFF,3c9acd,feelitallaround,2,Mon Jul 6 02:49:57 2015 UTC,"First trade is decent. Gurley (1.02), Mason (early-2nd), and a 2016 1st. It's not enough, but it's ok.  Second trade is meh. Peterson (1.10-1.12), two 2016 1sts. It'd completely depend upon the teams for this one, but I'd lean towards no.  This trade is probably the best offered. Watkins (only 3-4 spots lower than Lacy in startups) and Abdullah (1.08-1.10). Depending on my team I'd take this trade.  Trade four also isn't bad, but I'm not a fan of Graham at all. If you are a Graham fan this is probably your best bet. It's got Graham (who a lot of people value in the early rookie pick range), Abdullah (1.08-1.10), and a 2016 1st for Lacy and Cameron (early-2nd)."

Yea...his ceiling is sky high, but so was Tavon Austin's...and he didn't even come into the league with a huge knee injury. You guys are WAY overvaluing a guy who hasn't even stepped onto the field as a pro yet, and one who will probably miss significant time in his first year.  Watkins is probably worth 2 firsts, or 3 if they're the absolute last picks...but I'd have issues trading that much for him considering his current situation."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,Cavemansol,3,Mon Jul 6 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know dude, by almost every market-based valuation of him he's worth at least 2 first rounders unless we're talking 1.01-1.03.  His rookie draft ADP is nearly 1.01. It's for sure between 1.01 and 1.02. To trade up from, say, 1.08 to 1.01 will cost you at least another late first rounder to do so. Trading up from 1.12 to 1.01 would cost you a bundle more. Even trading up from 1.05 to 1.01 will cost you a pretty penny depending on what your partner's tier breaks look like.  As for startups, his June ADP on DLF is 20th overall. That's higher than Brandin Cooks, T.Y. Hilton, and Jordan Matthews. It's below Rodgers and Hopkins.  I can definitely understand an argument that his value in a vacuum is over inflated for a guy coming off an ACL injury, but given his NFL draft position and the general attitude toward ACL injuries in general, I'm not super concerned. Otherwise, ADP has him squarely behind Bell and Lacy as the RB3 overall. Personally, I have him #2 behind only Bell."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,quickonthedrawl,2,Mon Jul 6 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"I get that he's 1.01-1.03 range right now, but I still think thats crazy considering he's shown nothing since his Injury to support that he's gonna be 100% anytime soon. Everything we're going off is what team trainers have echod from team doctors. Until someone shows me a video of him actually making cuts in full gear I'm just not comfortable paying 1.01 for him."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,Cavemansol,2,Mon Jul 6 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'd feel the exact same way if he were drafted in the 2nd or 3rd round. The Rams taking him at 10 (when they had a somewhat viable RB corps already!) settled my nerves a lot when it came to drafting Gurley in a rookie draft. Not only that, there were multiple teams in the top half of the draft that would have taken him if St. Louis didn't. His over/under in online prop bets was something like 16?  NFL teams often make mistakes, but I suspect this is a case where if Gurley doesn't pan out, it'll be due to something freak/horrific happening, not his injury last year."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,feelitallaround,2,Mon Jul 6 04:53:07 2015 UTC,"I guess when it comes down to it, I'd gladly take Cooper @1.01 instead, and might even consider Gordon over Gurley in a lot of leagues. I'd take a healthy rook with J.Charles type upside over an injured rook with AP upside almost every time."
DynastyFF,3c9acd,quickonthedrawl,3,Mon Jul 6 05:06:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with regard to Cooper, but definitely don't agree with regard to Gordon. Guess that's why we play the game though. :)"

DynastyFF,3c9acd,joshhorn8,2,Mon Jul 6 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"It depends, really. If you are in win now mode, Peterson's (likely) last couple years in the league are worth a first. However, if you are in win now mode, you aren't trying to get rid of Lacy for picks, as he has the potential to be a top 5 back for at least the next 4 years.   I would take Jordan Cameron away from the last trade, both because I feel Lacy is already worth the other side of that trade and also because I think Cameron has a big uptick in catches/targets with a competent QB throwing to him.   Gurley was most likely taken at 1.1 or 1.2, which is obviously worth more than a mid-late first rounder, but Tre Mason isn't worth much right now, despite his youth, and the first isn't enough to bridge that gap. I would need another second thrown in for that trade to be acceptable."

Their run game is mediocre at best, and their pass protection is pretty darn good. Cooper steps right into the role of the Raiders WR1 and should be a PPR monster. If not from day 1, then certainly by the end of year 1, I would expect him to be a high WR2 or low WR1 in PPR leagues.  Cooper is the most NFL-ready rookie WR we have this season and by all accounts would have been right up with Evans and Watkins last year for the top tier of rookies. Evans and Watkins both exceeded year 1 expectations, but both would still be extremely valuable commodities today if they had disappointed. Cooper has the same kind of insulation and upside.

DynastyFF,3c6wc5,Vacar,3,Mon Jul 6 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"You make some great points. He's extremely polished and prepared for the main stage; however, taking him at 13 is a huge risk for any startup team. I don't touch him until the late-2nd.  Derek Carr isn't a good quarterback -- yet. He showed nothing last year that said he's the guy in Oakland. Historically in the past decade the Raiders' upper management has rebuilt that team very poorly over and over. Taking Cooper was a step in the right direction, but I'm still concerned with the pieces built around him. Much like Benjamin he's going to be relied on heavily and early. This could do one of two things: rapidly excel his development or cause him to plateau. I'm not concerned so much in Cooper as I am the Raiders.  I'm in love with Watkins as a player, but every time I see people forecasting him for 10+ years of WR success I laugh. He's in the same situation, except for one thing -- he's already proved he's the real deal in his rookie year. I'd be much more comfortable taking Watkins -- or Hopkins like you said -- here at slot 13 than a receiver with absolutely zero NFL experience.  In the past I've just been hesitant with rookies, because Tavon Austin looked like he was going to be the guy to own. His stock plummeted extremely fast. Drafting at this spot you'd have a guy at 12, then your next best player at 36 -- ouch.  As you've said, Cooper has a great deal of upside, but with much more added risk than Evans or Watkins."

Cooper ended up going at 2.06 after all those guys were gone, and in reality, I think that's about right?   Mostly wanted to make a case for a guy here that (IMO) is at least on the same tier as the rest, and if I were looking to punt an additional year or two, he seems defensible here. I tend to go hard at prospects in startups though."
DynastyFF,3c6wc5,Vacar,2,Mon Jul 6 16:08:24 2015 UTC,"I think 2.06 is definitely fair for Cooper. If I'm in a startup I don't touch him till 2.09, but it's completely dependent on how the rest of the draft has gone. If there's a huge WR run I might grab him early.  Glad you made the case for Cooper though, because I enjoyed your Hopkins mini-writeup as well. I'd much rather see someone grab a guy early and make a case for him, instead of taking the same guy with no support for why he was taken there."

DynastyFF,3c6wc5,PaoloPWD,2,Tue Jul 7 09:29:02 2015 UTC,"3.01 Allen Robinson, WR, JAX Sticky mentioned him and I think he is the pick here at 3.01. After having a solid rookie year be cut short by injury, the training camp reports are glowing as he looks to take over the #1 position in JAX."
DynastyFF,3c6wc5,quickonthedrawl,2,Tue Jul 7 19:01:21 2015 UTC,Love him here. If you didn't take him I would have! Legit chance he ends up jumping 8-10+ spots in ADP by this time next year.

DynastyFF,3c6wc5,Fantasyexpert2,5,Sun Jul 5 13:52:25 2015 UTC,"Ok i'll be that guy.  I understand that OBJ is crazy talented.  He might be the most talented receiver in the league.  I know that he'll be peppered with targets.  I have no idea how someone could take him as the #1 overall player in a startup.  He's only played 12 games in his entire career.  He's got an QB who is very inconsistent.  He's had injury issues.  He's a diva on a team who's head coach is not afraid to bench divas.  Teams now have NFL tape on how to game plan around him, and the other receiving options in NY aren't very impressive (Cruz, Randle, Donnell).  I get that this game is all about upside and potential, but why not take someone who has been a consistent producer at a high level and most likely will be for the next several years (Dez or Julio)?"
DynastyFF,3c6wc5,LUCIFERx88,6,Sun Jul 5 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how someone could take him as the #1 player in a startup.   Because he is only 22 years old. The other guys you mentioned are 4 years older. The NFL is a rough game and the body starts to show its wear and tear around 29-31 years old. I understand the small sample size argument but did you watch him play? He had the best rookie season I've seen since Randy Moss and he only played 12 games on an injured hamstring. I'd also be willing to take the 7-8 WR1 years Odell has left in him compared to the 3-4 Dez or Julio have.   He's a diva on a team who's head coach is not afraid to bench divas.   Your argument was valid up until here. He is nowhere near the diva that T.O, Ochocinco or Randy Moss ever were. Even if he were, no coach is ever going to bench a player of that talent level. Funny that you also mention a bigger diva as a guy you'd take over him."
DynastyFF,3c6wc5,Fantasyexpert2,3,Sun Jul 5 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"The NFL is a rough game and the body starts to show its wear and tear around 29-31 years old.   Couldn't it be argued that OBJ's body is already showing wear?  Dez has played every game over the past 3 seasons.  As far as the 3-4 years against 7-8 argument, how long are these players supposed to be under contract for?  In my league players are signed to a 5 year max contract that has a percentage bump in salary each year.  I know not all dynasty leagues are the same, but what's the probability of OBJ staying on your team for 7-8 years?    I know it's a little off point, but i'd be interested to know how players are kept on a team in this ""draft"".  As far as the diva part goes, it doesn't really make sense that you'd counter my argument by saying that Dez is a bigger diva.  Coughlin is a no-nonsense coach while Garrett is mostly a puppet who does what Jerry Jones tells him to do.  And Jerry Jones would never bench Dez.  It's two completely different situations."
DynastyFF,3c6wc5,Sticky_Z,5,Sun Jul 5 21:25:36 2015 UTC,This is dynasty. You keep all players forever. For future reference :)
DynastyFF,3c6wc5,LUCIFERx88,3,Mon Jul 6 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'll give you Odell is a bit injury prone but so are Julio and Dez to an extent as well. Hell every player has some sort of injury issue. I assume they are kept forever but if they in a 5 year deal I can definitely see taking Julio over OBJ, but if kept forever like most dynasty leagues, I'm taking OBJ. I seriously doubt Coughlin would bench OBJ after seeing how great he was last year.  Edit: Also just because they have been healthy most of their career doesn't mean they will be at the tail end (Ex:  my favorite player Megatron). He was a guy, just like Julio, who dealt with minor nicks and bruises most of his younger years and now it seems like his body isn't holding up like it used to. The other problem is that once these older guys get hurt they lose so much more value than if Mike Evans were to tear his ACL next season. That's just my 2 cents on it though."

(I'd honestly take Mike Evans over him too, but that's just preference and backed by my faith in huge WR's with talent (see Megatron, Andre Johnson et al).

DynastyFF,3c7t9e,coltreddit,3,Sun Jul 5 18:29:02 2015 UTC,I'd expect Dorsett to be a 5th round startup pick next year at the minimum average (similar to D. Adams). I'd have him as high as a 3rd/late 2nd if Hilton doesn't re-sign and he does well this year.  DJax is almost 29 on an bad offense with no young receivers and will almost certainly pick up a young WR next season. He'll have probably a good season this year and maybe a few decent ones after that but his value will never be more than a startup 5th max due to his age/situation. If you want upside and long term (but somewhat speculative) value go Dorsett. If you want a good WR3/4 for this year keep DJax.
DynastyFF,3c7t9e,boredatworkbored,2,Sun Jul 5 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"I would RUN to trade DJax for Dorsett.  Dorsett has a ton of upside in the future, paired with an elite QB for a long time.  Wouldn't really be much of a question to me"
DynastyFF,3c7t9e,ShanePHallam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"Start how many WRs? Dez and Matthews definitely start above DJax, but I'd have Charles Johnson and DJax pretty equal right now, until we see what role Johnson will have next year. You'll be trading away your WR3 or WR4 for a likely 1-2 year stash, as I don't think anyone expects Dorsett to do a whole lot this year. Guys like Wilson, Jones, and Wright are a clear step down from DJax. Still might be worth it, but if you're expecting to make a title run, you need DJax more than you need Dorsett."

DynastyFF,3c7t9e,blardorg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:21:46 2015 UTC,DJax will probably be on my bench for most of my season. I know he is worth more than Dorsett this season but I won't need DJax this season that much although I expect a good season from him this year.
DynastyFF,3c7t9e,forum1388,2,Sun Jul 5 19:24:11 2015 UTC,"DJax will probably be on my bench for most of my season.   I guess I just don't think that's true :) Jamaal Charles, Dez, and Jordan Matthews will definitely start ahead of him. Then I'd include him in the tier with Carlos Hyde, Justin Forsett, Charles Johnson, and probably Kendall Wright. If none of your guys get injured, Hyde doesn't disappoint (and since it's 1 PPR, and Reggie Bush will take the passing game work, DJax might score more than him anyway), Forsett doesn't get his workload reduced, and Charles Johnson becomes a legit WR3 at least, then sure, DJax might be on your bench. But the chances of none of your guys missing games due to injury and none of them disappointing is just honestly pretty low. You're in rough shape behind that set of starters."

DynastyFF,3c7t9e,JoshNipples,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:29:52 2015 UTC,I see but he is 28 going on to 29. If one of my young receivers breaks out then I don't need to trade.
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,TyBurna,7,Sun Jul 5 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"Based on talent and your settings I think Kevin white has too much value to pass up. The potential to have three great  young wide receivers in a PPR league is huge. For the 1.14 I would rank the remaining players based on talent alone and then after that make another list of their value to your team and use that to find any players you would absolutely want over a quarterback. Only four players will be taken between your picks so you should be able to make a good short list of any players that are must haves over the quarterbacks. With some of the veteran options at qb you could also take one of them with a later pick and shoot for the good qb draft class next year. Hope some of my thoughts helped, either way your team is well set up for now and the future."
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,dulzura,4,Sun Jul 5 07:15:29 2015 UTC,"Personally I would say take Kevin White with your first pick if he's still there. IMO he could very easily develop into a player of Julio Jones' caliber. You could take Winston with your 1.14, But personally I would take a player like an Ameer Abdullah or a TJ Yeldon (if he's still there, which I doubt he would be). If you really want one of the QBs I would probably say to trade some of you later second round picks and see if you can move up some spots. But if you want to stand pat,I wouldn't be completely opposed to that either. Like you said, you're in a good position no matter what. Just don't reach too far for a player when you could easily get more depth to continue contending for the next few years."
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,the_real_Alex14,6,Sun Jul 5 07:15:30 2015 UTC,Kevin white and laugh all the way to the bank
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,Blacky31,5,Sun Jul 5 08:02:42 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity are there other teams as stacked as you are at RB/WR? Holy cow. With the talent available to you at 1.08 and 1.14 it looks like you are going to be absolutely loaded at both.   I'd still go with White at 1.08 as even though you have good depth there already. At 1.14 if Winston is still there he'd be hard to pass up for your situation. I think he could outscore Cutler this year. If Winston is gone I'd wait and target one of those other QBs at 2.10 and use 1.14 on another BPA (Yeldon, Abdullah maybe?). You are going to come out of these two picks with a lot of value either way."
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,LincolnSteve,2,Sun Jul 5 07:57:44 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question, no. We started this league up a little late last year. I had drafted Demarco Murray with my 1st pick. Another guy asked if I would trade him, so I asked for Charles, his 2nd round pick and a 2nd for 2015. He accepted it which I wasn't expecting. I got Randall Cobb out of that deal to pair with Antonio Brown. Gronk somehow was still there in the 3rd. Hill was an unknown quantity so I got him later.  It looks like a resounding opinion to get Kevin White, which I agree with after doing some outside research. He's got too much potential to pass up, and with Jeffrey taking attention away from him, he could put up some very nice numbers right away.  And I'm up! Kevin White it is."
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,NannigarCire,3,Sun Jul 5 15:36:38 2015 UTC,Thank you guys for the help. It made my decision really easy. Kevin White is now a very nice addition to my WR corps.
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,phesto604,4,Sun Jul 5 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"White is available at 1.08? That's insane. Grab White. If he goes, the next best talent is Abdullah.  If you want a QB, trade one of those picks for an established QB. Expecting Rookie QBs to succeed is a losers gamble, no matter how great the prospect. If you're really in fear of missing out, Jameis isn't that much of a reach since by that time he should be one of the top 3 talents left on the board. Drafting Mariota that high is a horrible idea imo. On my board, the order i'd rank what's remaining is White, DGB, Abdullah, Yeldon, Agholor and then Winston. IMO, roll the dice on Palmer or Bradford, both of them have at least shown they can put up numbers when they're healthy."
DynastyFF,3c6bwj,Sticky_Z,2,Sun Jul 5 08:21:01 2015 UTC,Take White or Agholer and try to pick up Flacco. I really think Joe Flacco is going to blow up this year with Tressmen

DynastyFF,3c3zuv,VanBurenOG,2,Sat Jul 4 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"Cleveland running backs are a tough nut to crack and carrying any of them brings significant risk.  Depending on any of the three as a starter going into the season will be difficult.  The exciting thing about Cleveland is that there will be oodles of carries as they'll be one of the heaviest run-oriented offenses in the league. The downside is that the inept passing game will likely stall drives and limit scoring opportunities, and they'll have to throw late in games when trailing.  Crowell should be the most dependable guy.  However, the coaching staff showed last year that performance in practice will carry extreme weight in dictating touches on Sunday - meaning you'll have to always monitor the situation.  Don't be surprised when it's just ""oh hey, West is starting this week"" completely randomly. Whichever back earns the start each week will be a touchdown-dependant start.  Duke Johnson might end up being a big time scorer in PPR. As the passing down back, the Browns offensive garbage could be Duke's treasure.  There should be plenty of check downs due to the limited play making ability of the receivers and the limited arm of the quarterback.  Late in games, Duke could take over getting virtually all the RB touches when the team is inevitably trailing.  Buy Crowell at your own risk.  As an aside, Abdullah sucks. I watched him a ton in college, and I never saw any sort of ""elite explosiveness"" from him. I also don't think he runs very hard. I really, truly think he sucks."
DynastyFF,3c3zuv,peckx063,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think that Crow opening OTAs as the starter and the drafting of Duke means that Crow will handle the majority of the early down work and West will be used more to spell Crow as opposed to taking carries away from him.  I also think the healthy return of some key pieces on the o-line will help them move the ball.  Then again I could be completely wrong about everything and Crow, Duke and West all end up making each other useless in fantasy.  I didn't see anything that special in Abdullah either, but he's better than Bell (who's been the definition of mediocre), and Riddick is nothing more than a slot receiver classified as a RB.  I'm a Lions fan who watched every game last year, and I'm pretty confident that offense is ready to take a big step forward in the second year of Lombardi's system, and Abdullah is better than anything else we have available at the position."
DynastyFF,3c3zuv,joshhorn8,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:13:10 2015 UTC,"I think he's more valuable in standard scoring, but mid to late 20s is about where I would have him in PPR. Of the guys you mentioned, I like Abdullah and Vereen more in PPR, but they're all in the same range of spots. I'm not an Ellington or Coleman believer. Personally, I think Johnson is talented enough to eat into a bit of the 1st and 2nd down work, so I expect the touches to be pretty evenly split between them."
DynastyFF,3c3zuv,peckx063,2,Sat Jul 4 15:57:52 2015 UTC,What don't you like about Coleman?  I love the fit in Atlanta for him.

I will give him one thing that could help prove me wrong: he is decent in pass protection, and that is rapidly becoming one of the most important traits for an NFL back to see playing time."
DynastyFF,3c3zuv,mrpizzacoli,0,Sat Jul 4 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"I like Coleman but Freeman is still a very capable RB.  I have a hard time ranking rookie RBs high because we still have no idea how they'll perform in the NFL, and Crow has already proven he can produce as a lead back."
DynastyFF,3c3zuv,JoshNipples,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"I have him in the late 20's and I would have ranked him even higher if the Browns hadn't drafted Duke Johnson. I could easily see a scenario in which Johnson starts to steal some touches from Crowell as the season progresses, especially in the passing game. The RB situation will certainly be worth monitoring in the preseason, but barring an unexpected turn of events I think you are right that West will likely be the odd man out."

Don't think I would ever take DGB or Perriman over Agholor. Maybe if I had a lot of roster insulation. I just feel like while they prolly have move upside they also have a higher bust potential. Maybe it's a philosophy thing. I'll try to take the surer thing usually. Agholor looks like he has all the tools to succeed in phi.
DynastyFF,3c2y62,Sticky_Z,2,Sat Jul 4 12:51:03 2015 UTC,"As for Gurley/ Gordon, I really do like Gordon a lot. I just value WRs in dynasty more, and look to secure those types of prospects first.

I get that DGB has great measurables but he's got a ton of character issues on and off the field, hasn't played football at a high level in roughly 2 years, and is on a mess of an offense.  I understand that we're looking at the long term here, but to put a players who's got a bunch of red flags all over the place and in front of talented prospects who could contribute as early as this season just doesn't make sense to me."
DynastyFF,3c2y62,joshhorn8,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:53:51 2015 UTC,"I think the big reason is that while his floor is lower than most of these other guys, his ceiling is probably the highest in the class. He's not just a big, fast body; he is fairly refined as a receiver and has good ball skills. Like you said, we're looking at the long-term, so counting on rookies to contribute this year is obviously not a good thing to base our valuation on. I think the most important thing in rookie drafts is to look at tiers of talent, then use situation to sort within those tiers; situations change, but talent doesn't. I'll admit, DGB requires a specific type of risk-tolerance, but I think that is baked into his price near the end of the first."
DynastyFF,3c2y62,Fantasyexpert2,2,Sat Jul 4 23:34:30 2015 UTC,Agree somewhat but he's the opposite of refined. He ran the most basic of routes in college and there are quotes that his early practices/impressions are very bad. Completely lost on the whiteboard and zero nuance as a route runner. That coupled with the fact that Mariotta/Wiz will restrict the offense means he's close to undraftable to me.
DynastyFF,3c2y62,JoshNipples,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:43:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, refined isn't really what I meant, and definitely not as a route runner, though he isn't terrible. He might actually benefit from a more simplified offensive scheme that's task oriented (best description of Mariotta's playing style I've heard) and doesn't require him to make many reads of the DBs. Now to be honest, I haven't paid any attention to the OTAs and workout chatter thus far, so I can't comment on anything in that regard. TEN was definitely a less than ideal landing spot (I was really pulling for NE at the end of the 1st)."
DynastyFF,3c2y62,Phoenixzeus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"All fair points and ones I would have expected to hear. This one is more of a planting the flag prospect for me. His red flags are a bit overstated for me.   Nelson was a bit overdrafted, and while he will perform early, he's not a better prospect than Matthews - so he's the number 2 in his offense.   Perriman is going to produce early as well and as mentioned, however, he still has plenty of work to do himself outside of the 9.   DGB ahead of these guys for me is not against the other two, but more for DGB. He just has the highest ceiling of any WR in this class. If you're going for safety, the other guys are the way to go. This is just more telling of how I'd personally rather draft.   Mariota is an accurate QB, and I think the pendulum will slowly start to swing in DGB's direction. He's a physical freak and will be the guy they hoped they had in Hunter. I'm looking for the Mariota and DGB connection to hit on all cylinders, but I don't see it happening right away."
DynastyFF,3c2y62,Biggie2207,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:59:22 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on why you think his red flags are overstated?  To me he's got the most red flags of any highly touted prospect in recent memory.   Character issues on the field (reports that he is very difficult to coach, he's looked completely lost so far in OTAs, and a suspect work ethic) Character issues off the field (weed arrests, implicated in a burglary and allegedly pushed someone down a flight of stairs) Sloppy route runner (which could be corrected, but that leads back to the on-field coaching issues) Has trouble getting separation Hasn't played high level football in roughly 2 years Playing with a rookie QB on a bad offense that will most likely take several years to get better   Here's his upside:   Good size Decent hands Good body control   I'd really like to hear from someone who is a DGB believer why you think all of those red flags are overstated, or at least why you think they aren't going to cause him some serious issues as he tries to grow as a player."

DynastyFF,3c462j,Sticky_Z,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:44:38 2015 UTC,My thoughts excatly. The value is onsane for the top 2 in superflex or 2qb
DynastyFF,3c462j,jurmxx,4,Sun Jul 5 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/2014/02/23/2qb-leagues-where-qbs-rule/  The top 10 QBs will go in the first 20 picks if your league is aware of their value.  In the first 40 picks, in a dynasty league, with PPR that is 2QB, the first 40 picks will be 20 QBs, 15 WRs, Leveon Bell, Graham, Gronk, Lacy etc.  Seriously the league you're describing, RBs will have very little value.  I personally would take a third QB or third WR before taking a first RB.  Your RB strategy then should be 6-12 RBs (depending on total roster size) of guys like Ivory, Gore, West, etc  Guys who are old or have little value in long term dynasty, and then you just pick the best 2 RBs each week from that pool of 6-12 guys.  Also in this startup draft I'd have both 3 QBs, and 5 WRs before I take a SECOND RB.  Seriously.  This will be a QB and WR dominated league."

I read an article dynastyleaguefootball.com/2015/07/03/instant-analysis-antonio-gates-suspended/ that says some experts would rate him anywhere from a future 1st to a future 3rd after the news broke.
DynastyFF,3c2inw,just_trizzy,2,Sat Jul 4 04:35:58 2015 UTC,"Future first is ridiculous. He's worth a mid 2nd at best, but honestly a solid flex player + a 3rd is a fair deal too. I'd consider it depending on team needs.  Unless I got a prospect I liked I'd probably just wait to see how he does and keep him unless I needed a flex player."

DynastyFF,3c2inw,soggystamen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:09:31 2015 UTC,If I could sell him for a very high second to a crappy team that's in a rebuild I would do that since I think that's overvaluing TE's anyway.

DynastyFF,3c2inw,J0hn-Stuart-Mill,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree. He has been on the field for around 300 snaps the past 2 seasons. While that is just 38% of the number of snaps that Gates has gotten, I feel that should be enough opportunities to differentiate himself from a decent talent to a great TE. There are so few great TEs in the league and you could tell early on that great TEs like Graham, Witten, Gates, Gonzalez, Gronk, and Hernandez were something special. Green's value is artificially increased right now because people assume that Gates touches will go to Green instead of WR/RB. This is the perfect time to sell if you can get any type of increased value. Chances are, he will be a 2nd-3rd tier TE at best. Getting value back for him and then playing whichever other TE you have, could help you out in the long run."
DynastyFF,3c2inw,Fantasyexpert2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:54:05 2015 UTC,"Well, again it took Jordy Nelson until his fourth year to get a chance to fully prove himself on the field.  I admit I had no idea Green had that many snaps so far, (honestly, I'm shocked to see you're right!) but the one thing he doesn't really have is a scenario where the game is designed for him as the only TE.  He has always played the complimentary role, and so now we'll see four games where he's getting the full role for his skillset designed by the coaches, and not just ""what is optimal when Gates needs a break"" sort of thing.  So I agree, if you think he will fail, then sell now for whatever you can get.  BUT my logic is, you shouldn't hvae had him on your roster unless you thought he would succeed, and if that's your logic, then we're about to find out what he can do with the full set of reps."
DynastyFF,3c2inw,joshhorn8,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, having him on your roster because you think he's going to succeed isn't really logic.  Every player on any of our teams is there because we hope they can/will produce at some point.  Not really logical thinking, it's just the way the game is played.  Just because Green is going to be playing in Gates' position doesn't mean he's going to produce like Gates.  That doesn't necessarily mean he won't succeed, but I think it's important to note that chances are that he's not going to produce like Gates did.  I think if anything I think guys like Keenan Allen, Stevie Johnson, Floyd and the RB corps probably get more of a bump in value."
DynastyFF,3c2inw,J0hn-Stuart-Mill,5,Sat Jul 4 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"I actually think that @J0hn-Stuart-Mill makes a good point; we don't necessarily roster players just because we want them long-term. Lots of guys pick up players expecting to see an increase in value before selling them. For instance, I'm sitting on Charles Sims in one league, expecting that he will enter the season healthy and see a big chunk of touches in TB, then selling him to an RB needy team. I don't have to believe in his long-term talent (which I don't) or even that he will be a successful NFL RB (which I don't) to have him on my roster. He's just a guy I got for a low price, and I think I'll be able to sell him for more sometime in the future.  At the TE position, elite production is so scarce that I'm not really trying to mine it for value with ""flash in the pan"" production or hype. I personally think that the potential value gain of a high-upside guy like Green turning into an elite TE, even if it isn't a high-percentage play, far outweighs the value of a 2nd round pick.  The biggest knock on Green's value (and playing time) last year was the terrible blocking of the offensive line. This led to SD playing lots of 11 personnel in shotgun, with just 1 TE, 1 RB, and 3 WR on the field in an attempt to spread out defenses and open up the run game a little bit; add to that the fact that he is a better blocker than Gates, and you're set up for low targets. Assuming they stick with 11 personnel this season, for at least 4 games Green will likely see huge chunks of playing time, often matching up with LBs in coverage. It may also help that Melvin Gordon hasn't demonstrated great receiving ability, so SD may use him occasionally for PP instead of Green; I know that Danny Woodhead and Brandon Oliver will see some 3rd down work, but I expect Gordon to see a bit of it as well. Without Gates, Green checks the big TE success boxes: elite (or near elite) QB and no other clear #1 option in the passing game (I love Keenan Allen, but he's not an elite WR option). He's only under contract through this year (as is Gates), so if he flashes he will get his pick of suitors next offseason."
DynastyFF,3c1zss,BardSTL,5,Sat Jul 4 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"Cobb. Until Buffalo gets a reliable QB, Watkins won't reach his full potential. Cobb on the other hand recently extended his relationship with one of the best QBs in the league."
DynastyFF,3c1zss,Alexander_HamilDong,4,Sat Jul 4 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Cobb isn't 25 yet and is locked in with one of the top QBs for at least 4 more seasons.  Don't get me wrong, I understand that this is dynasty and in a vacuum Watkins is the superior talent, but 4 seasons of Aaron Rodgers is a major upgrade over whatever Buffalo is. Depending on team construction, I might take Watkins and a 2nd for Cobb, though I doubt most Watkins owners would be willing to do that."
DynastyFF,3c1zss,joshhorn8,3,Sat Jul 4 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"Cobb, no question. Mostly based on QB."
DynastyFF,3c1zss,ZeroCool79,2,Sat Jul 4 01:43:19 2015 UTC,4 years of Cobb + Rodgers is assuredly gonna better than 6-7 years of Watkins + Bills QB
DynastyFF,3c1zss,Cavemansol,2,Sat Jul 4 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"Given Buffalo's QB and coach situation, I'm not betting on Sammy having many 150+ yard games. Even more than in scoring without yardage bonuses, your league gives Cobb and WRs on prolific passing offenses a huge advantage. Cobb easily here. I know Watkins had several 100+ yard games last year, but he got a lot more competition for targets, an arguably worse QB with Orton retiring, and a very run-dedicated coach."

DynastyFF,3bzszg,accessgranter,10,Fri Jul 3 14:06:44 2015 UTC,That's a bunch of junk for a young QB that could turn into one of the best in the league. Decline.
DynastyFF,3bzszg,fropek,2,Fri Jul 3 14:35:29 2015 UTC,Exactly.  In a superflex with Luck and Tannehill you are literally sitting with the two best long term fantasy QBs in a league where QB is the most important position.  This team should be set to contend for the championship the majority of the next 10 years easy.
DynastyFF,3bzszg,J0hn-Stuart-Mill,2,Fri Jul 3 17:44:41 2015 UTC,I personally would pass. You have two proven (one stud) Qb's entering into their prime in a superflex league which is awesome. You don't seem to be receiving an upgrade at any position. You are receiving what will be two back ups in Sanchez/Bradford (depending on injuries) and Ball. A 2016 2nd is nice but no where near what Tanny is worth in a 2QB league. The 4th doesn't make up for it.
DynastyFF,3bzszg,Colin8012,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:27:28 2015 UTC,Two backups?  One of them will start and the Eagles QB position will probably out score the Dolphins QB position.  Plus he gets to handcuff his rb and and gets a 2nd rd pick.
DynastyFF,3bzszg,jbulkheader,3,Fri Jul 3 14:38:31 2015 UTC,I think Tannehill is definitely a better long term option than Bradford/Sanchez and he's at worst equal in the short term. Handcuffs in dynasty (and redraft) are overrated and a 2016 2nd just doesn't move the needle very much when talking about a guy like Tannehill in a 2 QB league. Hard pass for me.
DynastyFF,3bzszg,m_plis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"I like Sanchez/Bradford because for the past 2 years ""Philly QB"" has been a deceptively good fantasy player, the only problem being it hasn't been the same person.  On the flip side, I see almost no value in Ball and might just stick to Tannehill here in a Super Flex league."
DynastyFF,3bzszg,sicknarlo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence on this. On the one hand, Tannehill is a top 8 or 9 dynasty QB, given his youth and upward trajectory. In superflex, he should be commanding a quality return. On the other hand, Bradford + Sanchez is a quality pair to have as a QB2. I'd still prefer Tannehill, but you're getting a handcuff, a decent 2016 2nd pick, and an almost worthless 4th rounder.   If you could get a 2016 1st instead of the 2nd and 4th, I'd definitely do it. If not... I guess I'd probably decline, but it's very very close for me, and if you have any faith in Bradford being even a top 15 QB, I'd be totally fine giving Tannehill for this offer. And this is coming from someone with multiple shares of Tannehill across different dynasty leagues, so don't think I'm down on him at all :)"
DynastyFF,3bzszg,blardorg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:19:07 2015 UTC,That's a ton of roster spots. Who would you have to cut to make this happen. That matters too.   Granted...IF those teams actually arrive at permanent starters you'll have the Denver RB and the Philly QB this year. Which are good people to own if you are making a run.   But I'd be out of Denver...it's a one year team.  And who knows if the league catches up to Chip Kelly or his talent fire sale mentality loses him the team.   I'd say no.
DynastyFF,3bzszg,JoshNipples,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of who I'd cut, as well. I'd only have to cut two guys, which would probably be one of the two D/STs I have rostered, as well as either of Zach Zenner and James White, if not both of them."

To be honest, Sammy Watkins is the only target on his team that moves the needle for me at all if you're trading away Tannehill.  It would take something like Tannehill and a 2nd rounder for Watkins and Ball, give or take. I'm not even sure which of the two (Watkins, Tannehill) is more valuable right now straight up in a 2-QB."

Thank you for your feedback, however (I ended up getting Ball/Bradford/Sanchez/2016 1st/2016 4th for Tannehill)."
DynastyFF,3bzszg,gibbsftw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"Getting the 1st back isn't horrible. I would have kept Tannehill still.  Really, in aggregate, everything you got back is probably enough to be even - it's just Ball and the 4th are back-of-the-roster guys, and carrying both Philly QBs cuts a roster spot too. So it's a little deceptive."
DynastyFF,3bzszg,umaro900,2,Fri Jul 3 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the roster spots were a little tough to decide on - this is my first year in dynasty, so I suppose I'm still working through things. In two years, however, I'm hoping my players like Luck/Anderson/M. Bryant/Matthews are still good, while others such as Ertz/DGB/Strong have come up a bit. I have some time to draft a replacement for Tannehill or AP. Perhaps that analysis is incorrect, but it makes me feel a liiiittle better."

DynastyFF,3bzszg,blardorg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I don't even like Tanny that much and I would pass here.  Make him give up some real assets if you're going to sell.  The Bill Simmons translation of this deal would be something like you giving 1 dollar for  2 quarters, a dime, 2 nickels and a penny.    I think you should shop Tannehill around and see if there's someone wiling to buy the hype and overpay for him though."
DynastyFF,3bzszg,aussiemac24,0,Fri Jul 3 18:51:27 2015 UTC,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I like this. I'd try to change the 2 and 4 rounds into a first. But I love the qb opportunity at Philly with Bradford as a tremendous buy low. Ball is nice as a handcuff,  but he's burned me so much in the past. Overall, I'm just not drinking the tannehilll Kool aid. His ceiling is Andy Dalton in my opinion."
DynastyFF,3bzszg,huet99,2,Fri Jul 3 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you about the trade being deceptively pretty nice, but Tannehill is already better than Dalton, so not sure how Dalton can be his ceiling! Unless you mean 2013 Andy Dalton, who was QB#5 in total points and QB#7 in ppg... in which case, I'm totally fine with that being Tannehill's ceiling :)"

DynastyFF,3by3qi,JDriley,8,Fri Jul 3 02:52:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on roster size, but I think this is great news for CURRENT owners of Green.  We're going to get a real quick look at his actual talent in an NFL setting.  For me, one thing that I think that is not stressed enough in dynasty fantasy is timetable to seeing a player get his opportunity.  Take a guy like Moncrief or Davante Adams, or Latimer, these are guys waiting in the wings for their shot on the field, and each of them has had more than an entire year now with essentially nothing yet.  It's a waiting game with truly unknown timetable.  Green just got his shot, and we're going to find out quick if he's for real at the NFL level or not.  So unless someone is willing to give you a metric ton for him, you have no reason to not hold onto him until week 5 and re-evaluate.  You're going to get a huge insight into his potential then.  His speculative value he has right now can only balloon, and if it does you'll be left holding the golden ticket.  Will it happen?  Who knows, but you're the one currently holding that ticket and if you believe he is legit, then just wait a bit more.  Insane to sell now unless you have little to no confidence in him.  The reason timetable to opportunity is huge is because of the brutal truth of the NFL.  Most young NFL prospects are busts.  Seriously.  RBs, WRs, TEs drafted in the first round over the last 20 years have a 65% failure rate from a fantasy perspective, and for every Adrian Peterson who succeeds, there are literally a dozen guys who are forgotten over time who's career path follows ""successful"" yet not fantasy dominant players like Ingram, Morris, etc.  So one of the most important aspects to dynasty that goes unmentioned is holding as many of those ""lottery tickets"" on the day they mature, and you're holding Green's ticket, and the results are going to be real soon.  Holding guys young guys until they get their shot is very expensive in dynasty.  You have to pick wisely.  Even Jordy Nelson needed his fourth season until he had a year with more than 3 receptions per game, and before that his value was mostly speculative.    So only sell now if you think he will fail, because if he doesn't fail, his value is set to skyrocket."
DynastyFF,3by3qi,J0hn-Stuart-Mill,3,Fri Jul 3 12:02:05 2015 UTC,"I think people are underestimating the talent of Green and exactly how long Gates has been a statistical anomaly. I like Green a ton and think this should give him a great opportunity to rise to the occasion. The good news is if he doesn't, you can cut ties."
DynastyFF,3by3qi,swoodmanroxu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:36:43 2015 UTC,Wait till closer to the start of the season then trade Green to the Gates owner. If Green has a huge preseason game or something you will be able to sell high.
DynastyFF,3by3qi,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"You aren't going to be able to move him until he shows he will be valuable after Gates leaves. These 4 games will show that. Do not move him before, because the potential for his value to jump is more than whatever you can get now."
DynastyFF,3bxgrm,xlShadylx,3,Thu Jul 2 23:24:38 2015 UTC,I definitely think that is the only way that makes any sense. Have them protect like 4 players. It still leaves the new teams at a major disadvantage... Like leaving golden tate as a your WR1 Honestly it sucks but doing a full re do of the league is honestly the true best way.   An idea I just came up with is doing a quasi auction where each previous team can keep 1 or 2 guys and then everyone else goes into an auction. The original owners get a bit more money than the newbies. This could work with some thought haha either way it's not easy to expand   I would bring in new owners pre rookie draft. Adding them to the order is a tough one. Maybe if you do let owners keep a few players allow them to hold a 1st rounder as a player. They should get to keep their other picks imo. Throwing the new owners at 11/12 is kinda balls when they will be at a disadvantage already.   Cutting is marginally the same as protecting.   As for payment that's up to you. Why shouldn't they pay if they can win the pot. If you do the math and look at their pool of potential players and it's shitty... Maybe they get a free year  My honest opinion is to either not expand or do a total redraft. Or just have only 1-2 protections and let everyone draft off of that. Expansions are really tough in dynasty.
DynastyFF,3bxgrm,Sticky_Z,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"More difficult to manage, but would be neat if you gave owners a discount on their former players. Or some incentive where you get X% of the money you spent on former players back on top of whatever free agency allocation you normally get, and set the newbie FA limits higher from the get go so they aren't completely screwed for year 1 free agency"
DynastyFF,3bxgrm,blackngold14,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:13:37 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was going for sort of. I like the discount idea. Or they get like a free opening bid of some amount that dosent count towards their total. So if they owned Evans they get an X dollar head start. If a new owner really wants Evans they can just spend their capital on him
DynastyFF,3bxgrm,Sticky_Z,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:36:11 2015 UTC,"What do you think about expanding the amount of players you can protect after every time you get poached?  Like say, if someone takes your player - you can protect 2-4 more players?  That way if someone has a stacked team they've been working on, everyone isn't just feeding off just one GM."
DynastyFF,3bxgrm,Sticky_Z,2,Fri Jul 3 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you know your league better than we do haha. I like that idea. It's a bitch haha"
DynastyFF,3bxgrm,JoshNipples,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:34:53 2015 UTC,"We are expanding this off season, we are going from 8 to 10. We had an orphaned team, we decided to include all of his players in the expansion draft. So in essence we are going from 7 teams to 10.   It's a weird line to walk to be fair to both old and new teams. But since competition makes the league better, I was a big advocate of trying to make it as fair as possible. I still think we could have gone further but I am only one part of the decision making process.   We let teams protect 10 players (their starting line up).  Then expansion teams can pick one player, for each teams unprotected position groups.   Then we gave them extra picks (2s, 4s, and 6s) in the draft as well as giving them the earliest picks in each round.   Our expansion draft is Thursday, having mocked it several times to make sure they end up with a decent core of players, it worked well.   I'll know more in a week."
DynastyFF,3bxtmb,Sportsguy1223,2,Fri Jul 3 01:20:04 2015 UTC,"If you wanna deal Olsen for some picks that's not a bad play.  He is old as balls.  If it were my team, I see no need to trade for Eifert as I'd rather keep either of your other 2 guys. ASJ has a higher ceiling and Allen has a higher floor (not counting for injury)."
DynastyFF,3bxtmb,chkessle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"He's in a 12 team league where each manager only keeps 10 players.  120 players total kept means that Allen is unlikely to be kept, and ASJ is right on the bubble, since it's hard to keep a TE year after year in a league where you can only keep 10 total.  Few TEs production level justify being kept as one of the top 120 players in the league.  http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/rankings/te-rankings/  So to answer the OP's question, if you're certain Eifert will be dropped, then great, it's reasonable for you to try to get him in the draft and the cost to you is nothing other than a draft pick.  If you think the manager would want Olsen, and undervalues Eifert, then propose a trade of Olsen for Eifert + picks, OR if the manager is dropping Olsen because he has 10 stud players, then maybe make this offer;  Olsen and consensus WR #30 for Eifert and consensus WR #25  It all depends on the other manger's list of keepers and situation and such.  If you want Eifert go get him.  Olsen is a top 5 fantasy TE for the time being, but Eifert has a solid chance to leap frog him and be a top 5 TE for many years after Olsen retires."
DynastyFF,3bwto5,fantasyQuestioner,10,Thu Jul 2 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's wrong or inaccurate... But I sell the studs first if it's a major rebuild like that. I took over a team last year and dez was the only real stud. Sold him first, used that with the biggest return and ended up Evans and Arob+. Maybe last year is a bad judge but if I can turn ajg into white, Perriman, and Agholor I'm STOKED. sure he is a stud but if you are targeting 2018 ( 2 years is a good goal for a full rebuild) he will be almost 29 and who knows what that team really looks like/his contract.   I guess it comes down to the type of rebuild. If you are still thinking you can be competitive next year... Keep him otherwise I'm getting the fatest return possible."
DynastyFF,3bwto5,Sticky_Z,4,Thu Jul 2 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"Im glad you posted this, cause I am in a similar situation with a rebuild. I now have all very young talent from draft picks, but also have one elite guy in Cobb still, and I dont know what to do with him.  Things I am considering when assessing my personal Cobb situation:  1) Does his Age and projected prime years match up with your new window to compete after the rebuild.  2) What you could get in return for the elite star.   3) Do you see your elite Star's value more likely going up or down in the future. If down, I think you sell asap at his peak. For your case, Green I think's value is relatively low currently compared to his value last year at this time, so you'd wait it out.  4) Does your elite star limit you from tanking. Ideally in a rebuild, you truly want to suck for a year or 2 so you can get top draft picks, and get as much top end young talent as possible to maximize your new title window. As such, by trading your star that could ultimately win you games when your trying to lose, for future draft picks or rooks that may not yet produce to their fullest for another year or two is addition by subtraction.  Basically what I have decided is that I wont trade him yet, unless its for a young high upside QB (I am in a 2QB league so they hold way more value to me). Otherwise, Cobb is young enough to still be very fantasy relevant in my league when I think my rebuild will be complete (He was #6 overall scoring WR last year in my ppr league at the age of 23), and I really don't see his value dropping at all in the next 4 years as he is locked into the Packers offense with Aaron Rodgers. I hope he doesn't single handedly win me games lol but Ill approach that in season if so.  Patience is the key, and a team in title contention could come knocking on your door at the trade deadline with an offer you cant refuse."
DynastyFF,3bwto5,TitletownGB,3,Thu Jul 2 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"For a player like Green, Dez, Julio, et al - the real tier 1 studs - I think you have to sell them aggressively. Don't take a bad deal, but these are the kind of guys that won't ever go up in value, and they'll probably have peaked by the time you're done rebuilding.  Don't think you really gain much by waiting to move them unless a deal just isn't in the cards."
DynastyFF,3bwto5,quickonthedrawl,3,Thu Jul 2 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"Question 1: How long am I expecting this rebuild to take? Simply put, ""When can I win?""    Answer: I would think, when rebuilding, that most people would have a target of 2 to 3 years in the future for when they can expect their rebuild to be complete and ascend to the throne.    Question 2: Does this guy help me win now as opposed to win later? How old is this guy? Does their age work well with my target?    A: Win now guys would, in the context of a rebuild, probably be guys like Dez, Julio, AJ, DT, etc. These guys are currently in their prime and will likely lose value as opposed to gain it by the time you are ready to win. Can you hold them? Yes, but I think it will hinder your team in the long term. I would actively sell these guys first and look for the best price you can find. Ideally you would sell these guys for a younger counter part without giving up too much extra.    These are just a couple of questions I have asked myself when thinking of rebuilding teams."
DynastyFF,3bwto5,username02,3,Thu Jul 2 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say if you're blowing up, might as well go full blown, unless its guy like Watkins, Beckham, Randall Cobb, that are young enough to still help in 2 to 3 years. Why hold em if he's gonna be on the way out by the time your team is priming?"
DynastyFF,3bwto5,bplush,2,Fri Jul 3 00:45:42 2015 UTC,"I saw wait to get the most you can get from AJ.   Timing is important in a rebuild or ""blow up."" They are more valuable in season. Right now, youth and picks have a higher value.   Mid season the picks/youth will be easier to get from a team that thinks they are competing."
DynastyFF,3bwto5,JoshNipples,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:08:57 2015 UTC,Yea I think this is the way to go from what everyone is recommending.  I kind of wish I traded him away for some high draft picks before we did that but I'll hold and see if I can get a pair of younger talents like Cobb or a player+ with him.

DynastyFF,3bxpkv,umaro900,2,Fri Jul 3 00:53:18 2015 UTC,"I think it heavily depends on your roster. Is Blount behind Bell, Ellington, Morris, and Stewart on your roster that starts 3 RBs and is solid at other positions? If so, The upside of Blount can be capped by the unpredictability of the Patriots, and you've got a solid RB any week instead of him. With the same settings if your only proven RBs were Bell and Ellington, Blount could be figuring his way into starting for you every week, assuming you're not in a total rebuild.   In other words, it's probably a fine trade offer, but you keep Blount if you are weak at RB and you get Johnson if you are strong at it."

That's about a 4 month window. The NFL sends the tester out, who arranges to meet with the player and watch the player pee into the cup.  This almost always happens at training camp since the tester can get 80+ players in one visit. If a player tests positive they get a second chance and are subject to more tests for 90 days.

DynastyFF,3bvw4f,thefadd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:42 2015 UTC,He went 1 pick before me at 18. I cried like a little girl.
DynastyFF,3bvw4f,thefadd,2,Mon Jul 13 13:14:34 2015 UTC,Didn't you trade for Rodgers and Tate?
DynastyFF,3bvw4f,jdr393,3,Thu Jul 2 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"Nope.  The guy getting ""just Robinson"" thought he was getting the short end of the stick so he backed out."
DynastyFF,3bvw4f,JoshNipples,2,Thu Jul 2 18:25:04 2015 UTC,"In my league, I don't think I could get Sammy for Calvin (I have Calvin on my team). My league is very biased towards youth though. According to DLF Calvin = 7 and Sammy = 13 in the WR rankings. Either way, I think it's grounds for a fair trade. Plus, you already have 2 WR1s and a potential 3rd that will all be around for  a while.   That said, your biggest upgrade area is RB. Why not try to target Foster or Lynch if you're in win now mode. If either owner is rebuilding you could probably trade Sammy for RB+ Picks"
DynastyFF,3bvw4f,bplush,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"I traded Watkins for Megatron last fall and they're right in the same start-up range so the value is there. Pulling the trigger is just a matter of preference.  With the youth on this roster, I would not be looking to get older. I feel exactly like you do -- the guy put up 200 points in PPR as a rookie with no QB! Personally, I would ride your four amigos at WR for years and almost never touch them."
DynastyFF,3bxhq3,LawyerUpHitGym,2,Thu Jul 2 23:33:30 2015 UTC,Eh honestly I think this team is quite weak for a 10 team league. I'd be surprised if you made the playoffs. Good luck
DynastyFF,3bxhq3,harrytrum4n,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:49:32 2015 UTC,My gut is your a borderline playoff team but can't possibly win.   I wish I had a stronger opinion on it. I guess you just have a few players that I think are overvalued. But what do I know?   Good luck.
DynastyFF,3bxhq3,JoshNipples,2,Fri Jul 3 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"Projected lineup: QB: Ryan RB: Forte/Morris WR: AB, Jordy TE: Davis or Walker FLEX: Allen/Djax/Johnson (2 each week)  You have some nice sleepers in Freeman, David Johnson, and Reuben Randle.  ESPECIALLY Randle.  He's my sleeper of the year for 2015.  Could be a solid WR2 with Cruz missing time, and a WR3 with Cruz there.  Not bad for a 12th rounder or more.  I think you will finish 5th in the regular season.  With a little luck, you could finish 4th.  AB/Jordy will help carry you through a few games.  Davis, Allen, Stevie, and Patterson are nice bounce back candidates too.  If they produce solid numbers they could help you tremendously.  If this were my team, I'd try to trade Forte/Langford and one of your WRs NOT named AB or Jordy, for a solid RB1 or RB2.  I also like Gio Bernard going forward in PPR.  I'm not sure who to target without seeing your leagues rosters.  You also might be able to get Gio Bernard for a fair price if his owner isn't high on him.  I think he is HIGHLY underrated in PPR.  Hill is the main guy in Cincy, but Bernard is a very good pass catcher, and has elite level quickness/agility.  This is also his 3rd year in the league...the one most RBs finally reach their potential.  All in all, I think you have a competitive team, but you are 1 or 2 studs away from having a REAL shot at a title in a 10 team league.  Good luck."
DynastyFF,3bxhq3,gibbsftw,2,Fri Jul 3 11:42:45 2015 UTC,2qb starters
DynastyFF,3bxhq3,doodwhersmycar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"QB: B+     In 2QB, you did a solid job grabbing three starters and a possible man in waiting. No elite assets, but enough to string together some solid weeks. Starters: Ryan, Foles  RB: B-     For this year, I'm OK with this crew. You really don't have any great long-term assets here outside David Johnson, who I think has a real shot to be the starter in AZ. Forte is likely to see a hit to his targets, while Morris will be lucky to grab 10 passes. Starters: Forte, Morris  WR: B-   Again, you look OK for a few years with AB and Jordy, but you have a lot of aging assets here and the only member of last year's historic class is the only receiver in that class I want nothing do to with - Marquise Lee. I think Keenan Allen is a solid bounce back candidate for this season though. Starters: Brown, Nelson  TE: C-   Yikes. For needing 2TE each week, I'm not super thrilled about these guys for 2015, and even less so about the future. I just don't think Thomas has anywhere near the scoring capacity in JAX that he did in DEN. I'd like to see at least one high-upside guy added here. Ladarius Green would have been ideal three days ago. Starters: Thomas, Davis  Flex Starters: Allen, Jackson  Like these other folks have said, this looks like a competitive team for now, but I'm not thrilled at the long-term outlook. I'd be looking to move Forte/Langford, Jordy Nelson, Crabtree, and Davis in-season for younger assets."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,huet99,3,Thu Jul 2 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"Either way I do not see his value being very high. I don't think he and Whiz like each other. They brought in 4 new WR this year. Wright may be the one who gets his snaps cut while they figure out what they've got. If his snaps are the same I still don't see Mariota being a huge difference maker for him in 2015.   In 2016 he is off to a new team. The question I think you should be asking is, will his potential value with his new team make it worth holding onto him until then?"
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,chkessle,2,Thu Jul 2 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I want to free up a roster spot though, and Wright doesn't excite me like he used to. I just have no idea what his value is."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,xlShadylx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"Not much value there right now.  He's probably droppable, depending on your league. Maybe worth hold in a 12+ team league.  I'm in a similar situation, and I'm just going to hold him until I need the roster spot. The league I have him in is a 10 man."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"Hes kind of in one of those spots where some will pay above but most don't want a piece of it. I think you hold him for now and hope he turns it around. If a baller deal comes along or you can use him to bridge the gap in a bigger trade, go for it. Don't think he is a first cut for me but that depends on the roster. If you got a 3rd I'd be pretty happy. Someone might want a flyer on him for that price."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,quickonthedrawl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:30 2015 UTC,I've been trying to unload him since about this time last year. I think we're stuck now. He's got the potential to be a PPR WR2 still.
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:59:01 2015 UTC,"I think Wright is a sleeper this year.  I'm not sure DGB will be a strong go early on, let Wright have a few good games (heres hoping) and then move him.   There isn't a lot of love for him right now, so you would be selling low."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,longcoldstare,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:25:12 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think the same thing. Right now, I have him, Cody Latimer and Monte Ball competing for the last spot on my roster, and I haven't had any luck in trading one of them away yet ahead of roster cuts.  (Context: This is in a second-year dynasty league, but we only keep 10 of 23 going into the draft, so it's really a deep keeper league at the moment.)"
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,losingfriends,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"30 out of Wright's 93 targets last year were deemed uncatchable.    Mariota is drawing some serious praise for his accuracy, which he effectively displayed in college.    Wright is a hold for me, and I wouldn't let him go for anything other than an early second."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,peckx063,0,Fri Jul 3 17:33:56 2015 UTC,I think there's serious upside vs his current value.  One of Mariota's weaknesses is average to poor arm strength for a first round QB.  We could see a dink and dunk pass game out of Tennessee which could mean heavy targets for Wright.  I think you can hold and look for a resurgence to his rookie numbers.
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,ADQG,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:47:03 2015 UTC,Do you think this means bad news for Justin Hunter then?
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,Daigotsu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:14:06 2015 UTC,"You do know his MPH ball speed was higher than winstons.  His armstrength wasn't questioned it was the deep ball accuracy, and he actually completed more deep balls than winston did."
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,peckx063,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"On some deep balls he was better, but most teams would much rather have Winston throwing down the field than Mariota. Kind of hairsplitting though"
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,Daigotsu,-1,Fri Jul 3 07:52:29 2015 UTC,You do know arm strength pretty much means deep ball accuracy not how fast you can throw it?  I wanna know if you can deliver the ball on time and completable on 20+ yard routes.  Mariota's mechanics breakdown on longer throws and the ball tends to sail.  Also Winston is better at this and if you believe Mariota is then I implore you to roster him because he'd basically be the best one ever.
DynastyFF,3bw6p9,peckx063,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:43:24 2015 UTC,"They are not the same things. Arm strength mph more has to do with getting the ball into tight windows, while deep ball accuracy more has to do with judgement of where the WR will be on deep routes.  Combine measurements of MPh speed had Winston at 55mph, mariota at 56 mph.   Statistics from their college plays had Mariota complete a better percentage of deep balls than winston.   If you want links I can provide them, but considering you feel arm strength and deep ball accuracy are the same thing... which they really are not, I'm not sure the point is in educating you."
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,iGroosh,5,Thu Jul 2 16:03:02 2015 UTC,Definitely Cooper and which ever RB comes back at 1.03. I don't think that squad is half bad!
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:27:32 2015 UTC,Thanks that's kinda what I was thinking
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,NN1234,2,Thu Jul 2 16:45:11 2015 UTC,Cooper and a Rb make sense.  Seek your roster would help more.
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,xlShadylx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, he'll be fine ending up with Coop and either of the top two RBs.    I can't access imgur on my work PC, so I can see how badly you need RBs, but I'm sure you can sell Cooper high if that's the way you want to go after the draft for another RB."
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 2 16:28:29 2015 UTC,"I don' think you can go wrong with any of those. Depending on how much you want to rebuild, you could probably trade the 1.01 down to 1.06 and more picks to grab one of the RBs with your 1.03 and grab White/Parker at 1.06 plus more depth with added picks (Johnsons/Hardy/Agholor, etc).   EDIT: Just saw your roster. As nice as Amari is, you need some help at RB, so I'd go Gordon. He's healthy week 1 and has less competition. As talented as Gurley is, his injuries and Mason scare me. Long-term he's solid, but for you to enjoy this year I'd go Gordon. I still think you could trade back in the draft for more WR/RB depth at the expense of Cooper."
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,Millsstg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't even considering trading that pick down. Thanks!"
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,JoshNipples,2,Thu Jul 2 16:45:40 2015 UTC,Always draft the best talent on the board in rookie drafts. Trade for need.
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,maddenite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:25 2015 UTC,Cooper and whatever RB is left at 3.   Just pick BPA.
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,Sticky_Z,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"Between Gore, Hyde and JStew, you aren't hurting for RBs at all, just grab someone like Cameron Artis-Payne to cuff JStew along with Gordon/Gurley at the 1.03 and you're good IMO.  Take Cooper at the 1.01 and don't think twice about it."
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,Paloma_II,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I felt like they were very serviceable for dynasty
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,Paloma_II,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going off of two assumptions here. 1 is that you only have 1 flex position and the other is that you also have 2.01 since you received 1.03 in a trade.  Based on that logic, I take Gurley at 1 and then whichever of Gordon or Cooper was there at 3. It'd likely be Gordon, but that'd be fine for me. Our league actually saw Cooper drop to 4 because people all top 3 players needed RBs bad and drafted RBs. Parker, White, Yeldon, Abdullah, Perriman, Agholor and Coleman should come off the board afterwards in some order. At 2.01 you will potentially have DGB, Funchess, or any players that slips through the cracks. Perriman, Coleman, Maxx Williams and DGB were all there at 2.01 in our draft. Someone took Jameis at 2.04 and someone took Duke Johnson 2.08. I was able to snag Agholor at 1.10 with my own pick. The WRs and RBs that will be at 2.01 will be more than adequate to fill holes on your team.  That's actually a really solid squad, and I think Gurley has the ability to be a transcendent talent. I'd take him and hope that whoever is at 2 takes Gordon. If not, then just grab one of the WRs on the board at 2.01. There should be a pretty good one available and your WR situation is pretty good"
DynastyFF,3bvvkf,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. We do only have one flex, but I traded 2.01 in order to get 1.03. So after that my next pick isn't until 3.01"
DynastyFF,3bwlo9,Sausage9724,2,Thu Jul 2 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"You should format this by position, not draft pick.  Don't make the reader giving you input have to work for it.  My only other input is that you could have waited till the last pick of the draft to grab CLE D/ST, or even picked them up before week 1."
DynastyFF,3bwlo9,xlShadylx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:50:06 2015 UTC,I was just trying to show any value I might've gotten from where I drafted guys. I'll edit it
DynastyFF,3bwlo9,xlShadylx,2,Thu Jul 2 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're looking pretty rough on RB, but that's typically the route I like to go too.  Get dem WRs.  Much longer shelf life.  You just need one of those RBs to hit big - then try to grab a nice running back off the wire after (or before) week 1, and you'll be all set.  Not sure about EJ as a backup QB though.  I've heard rumors he may not even start.  Who's left on the wire?  Alex Smith?"
DynastyFF,3bwlo9,xlShadylx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my only other options really are smith, mccown, and cassel"
DynastyFF,3bwlo9,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:13:03 2015 UTC,"It's looking more and more likely the Tyrod Taylor will be the starter.  You may want to keep an eye on that.  As long as Taylor and Smith are available, you'll be fine.  You just need a bye week fill in anyway. But I'm not a fan of EJ in the first place, and would much rather have Smith."
DynastyFF,3bwlo9,aussiemac24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"If Blount gets any kind of numbers early on in the year, deal him immediately.   I would also look to move Cavlin Johnson.   I don't think you have the horses to compete this year, so you should be preparing for a couples years away.   Next year has great rookie QB's, position yourself to be able to risk one of them.   You have a great young core."
DynastyFF,3bw7go,lafan313,3,Thu Jul 2 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"This isn't bad at all. I think your WR needs work but you've got some guys who can put up numbers for you. Your RBs should be playing in the flex,  which I'm generally not a huge fan of in a full PPR format.  But in your case you've got 3 top 10 RBs (barring injury).  Vereen and Spiller should each have a few monster weeks and high floors too.  Freeman is a nice bye week fill in if he can get the passing down job and split time with Coleman in 1st and 2nd downs. Robinson is a value pick for the playoffs or for next year.   Between Agholor, Funchess, and Jones, you can stream a pretty nice WR3.  If one of them becomes a legit starter, you make your run.  Desean is too boom-or-bust for my tastes. If he has a strong first few weeks I may try to flip him for something.  But as a WR3/4 type he is ok. Sanders is the most high risk guy due to Peyton losing arm strength.  So if Agholor looks like hes breaking out I may try to trade Sanders too.  I don't think Sanders will be a WR2 without Manning playing at a high level.   It may be worth it to trade a 2016 pick in season if it helps you win this year."
DynastyFF,3bw7go,chkessle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:42:55 2015 UTC,Your WRs are slightly weak but you honestly did really well and I bet you have a good chance to win this year.
DynastyFF,3bw7go,PaoloPWD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:38:29 2015 UTC,If Bradford comes through he will be great trade value. Which might help you with the WR's a lil.   I think you can go far with this roster and you still have a young core that you can build from.   Also...love that no K or D.
DynastyFF,3bv6wb,Sticky_Z,3,Thu Jul 2 12:29:56 2015 UTC,I think its an alright squad. RoWill is a top 4 QB for superflex so you could do a lot worse. Rivers is fine and Mallet might surprise. Wr is a bit weak but you know that. RB has some potential but is a wait and see
DynastyFF,3bv6wb,thefadd,2,Thu Jul 2 14:51:02 2015 UTC,"I took Jimmy G in the 4th, and looking at WR's that came afterward there was Jordan Mathews and Kevin White. So maybe that was a mistake, but at the time I thought BPA was Jimmy. Annoyingly Brandon Cooks went just before my pick!"
DynastyFF,3bv6wb,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"It does look like you went BPA as you've got talent just not direction. Your squad's saving graces are the strength of your QB's (1 top 5 guy, another top 12 guy) and Jimmy Graham. Jimmy and Russell have a good week, you'll win. They don't, you won't.  If your league is competitive and balanced, you'll have a shot at someone like Watkins or a young RB getting hot and carrying you through the playoffs. It'd be hard to go against a really stacked roster.  Long term, it's a fairly young squad so I'd definitely start to look at moving my vets if this season goes south or next offseason. But having those 2 QB's and a top PPR TE, you'll be more than competitive in a balanced league."
DynastyFF,3bv6wb,chkessle,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:00 2015 UTC,I think you did well.   You have a good young players with potential.   Next year is a great year for QBs in the draft.
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,NN1234,4,Thu Jul 2 16:01:06 2015 UTC,Don't do that. You can get so much more for Julio.  3 first rounders is the rule of thumb.
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,xlShadylx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:22:30 2015 UTC,I agree. I guess I'm looking for opinions on next step as a counter or just decline and leave it. I think it is close somewhat as Watkins has to be worth 1.5 to 2 first rounders himself. So Watkins and 2.04 gets kind of closer.  I'd rather get a deal for mike Evans. I'm not sure Evans is obviously more talented than Watkins but is just better off situationally.
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,JoshNipples,2,Thu Jul 2 16:30:33 2015 UTC,Do you want the picks or Watkins/Evans enough to give up Julio?  What would you rather have more?
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:44:36 2015 UTC,"I prefer Julio in a vacuum but feel like I need to hit a few draft picks to have a chance to win within the next two years. Otherwise I should sell for youth and picks and rebuild.  Or I could keep Julio, sell a few veterans mid season to a team with needs for future draft picks to help the rebuild move along without losing Julio."
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"I think you need to decide what kind of team you are.  You can wait til midseason to let your record make the choice for you. Or you can make a choice now and work towards that.    But Julio's highest value will most likely be in season.   If you are rebuilding, I still think Julio can be in your plans, he's young enough."
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,xlShadylx,2,Thu Jul 2 17:12:45 2015 UTC,I agree Julio can be in my rebuild plans as it isn't crazy to think he has 4-7 solid producing years left.  Other people have told me I need to rebuild by selling him. I don't agree with them as I have 5 picks in the first 17 this year and 3 2016 1st round picks.
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:21:26 2015 UTC,He is a big bargaining chip. I can see what it's enticing.   But I think he would be more valuable mid season anyway.  I also think the chances or drafting someone as good as he is with all those picks isn't a risk worth taking.   Just my take.
DynastyFF,3bvvb4,Santidreet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:06:52 2015 UTC,"I would personally shoot for Evans over Sammy.  I wouldn't settle for anything less than Evans (or Sammy, if you like him better) and a first, and I'm not even sure I'd accept that.  For the record; I love Julio, so I'm biased.  Why not go for both?  Evans+Sammy for Julio+1st rounder (shoot for 2nd rounder first)?  You have a lot of picks. Gonna have to make room on the roster for them."
DynastyFF,3buqh7,Btk88,4,Thu Jul 2 08:48:37 2015 UTC,"Holy balls!  Wilson, Forte, Bell, Julio, Dez, AB, Cobb, and Gronk would be his starters?  That means he's probably #1 or #2 the next 2 years...which makes the picks he'd give you at the end of the 1st round.  No way I do that trade If I were you."
DynastyFF,3buqh7,gibbsftw,3,Thu Jul 2 11:23:58 2015 UTC,"While I think its more than fair, I'd be hesitant just because youd be relying on two rookies and two second year WRs (who I really like...but still) to be the backbone of you're team. You're already super young at WR even with AB, so its you don't necessarily have to make moves to get younger.  I wouldn't criticize the trade at all, just wanted to point out the risk of relying on guys who haven't quite established themselves yet. And honestly AB isn't ""old"" either. I might let him be the security blanket until Cooper/White/Robinson get up to speed.   Also, like you said yourself, those picks are all but guaranteed to be the last of the 1st round if he ends up with AB, Dez, Julio and Cobb as his WRs. Id maybe counter AB/2nds for Evans/Hyde/2017 1st?"
DynastyFF,3buqh7,Cavemansol,2,Thu Jul 2 09:49:07 2015 UTC,You just nailed exactly how I feel about the whole relying on too many young players. I think that's why I'm hesitant whilst liking the offer. I'll see about the counter cheers for the advice.
DynastyFF,3buqh7,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 2 10:33:21 2015 UTC,"Was going to suggest just that.  Mason is basically a throw in,  rather get someone with value in the long run like Hyde."
DynastyFF,3buqh7,peckx063,2,Thu Jul 2 09:58:05 2015 UTC,"So I'm in the clear minority here, but I'd be very tempted to take this trade. I do think you could downgrade your 2nd Rd picks to 3rds to further swing it in your favor. I'm a huge believer in sell high buy low. Mike Evans is 5 years younger and shows a ton of promise with a terrible QB. I doubt Jameis wil be a downgrade."
DynastyFF,3buqh7,xxandl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:09:39 2015 UTC,i think 3rds will be the way to go as u/peckx063 said that the potential gap between his first and my second might not be that far.
DynastyFF,3buqh7,JoshNipples,2,Thu Jul 2 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"His team is far superior right now. I'm not sure why he's going after Browm instead of a premium back which would put him over the top. As it stands, he'd be sitting Cobb on normal weeks. Your team is probably not competeting for a championship either way, so I love the idea of saving years by turning Brown into Evans.  However, with your 2nds and his firsts not being a huge difference of value, I'd want to alter the picks. Remove Tre Mason and take out one of your 2nds and I'm pretty sold."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,That1Time,3,Thu Jul 2 04:38:29 2015 UTC,"I could see selling Thomas high. Maybe for like an Adams/Bryant/Moncreif guy and an Abdullah/David Johnson kinda guy. Plus a little more if you can get it. People are obviously high on those guys but Thomas is still a top 15 dynasty stud and he should garner 2 or 3 prospects.  I wouldn't be in a hurry to trade him (you could wait until after this season, although there's an off chance he loses his value sooner than later) but he'll be the first go past his sell-by stud-date of all your guys, imho.  With honestly the two best WR's in fantasy and Watkins as a sick WR3, you could stand to strengthen another position like QB, RB2/3 or TE. Thomas + Thomas for Kelce and Bryant+?  Obviously I don't know the other rosters in your league but I'd aim for something along those lines. Cashing in Thomas for up and comers is how you're going to maintain a dynasty."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,thefadd,2,Thu Jul 2 07:47:10 2015 UTC,"With that roster I would try to package Julius Thomas and Demaryious Thomas and maybe a pick/young player and see if you can pry Gronk out of his owners hands.  I know Gronk's value is ungodly high but if you can swing that you starting lineup becomes:  Breese, Murray, Miller, OBJ, JJ, Gronk, Sammy and Joique/Charles Johnson  I believe Charles will be a sneaky good Fantasy WR this year.  Patterson isn't good enough in MN to steal his playing time and Teddy seems good enough to get the ball spread out between Wallace and Johnson.  Plus Wallace is still an unknown, what happens in week 3 when he doesn't get the ball enough and then yells at the Zim Zam?  If this doesn't work then I agree with trying to upgrade your QB.  Good looking team though, good luck!"
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,brandonfrank04,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:29:03 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could package the thomases together to get Gronk and a pick...
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,heyfeefellskee,2,Thu Jul 2 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"If I could trade the thomases and a 1st for Gronk I would take it and run sooooooooo fast.  I own Gronk and if someone offered me the thomases for Gronk AND a pick I would pee myself laughing.  Gronk's value is too high for that.  If you're serious about win now I would go as high as the Thomases, a 1st and 2nd for Gronk.    Nobody else at their position is so clearly and undeniably better better than the #2 and no other position is as devoid of talent as TE.  Sorry but Gronk is a 3 - 4 1st round value.  So if the Gronk owner in his league would take the Thomases and a 1st for Gronk you take it, say thank you, run like hell and then buy him a nice bottle of Whiskey to say thank you."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,brandonfrank04,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"ODB might never be as valuable of a trade piece as he is now.    Maybe try and move him for Gronk+ (if that's even possible)? Or, move him for Jamaal Charles+.    TE and RB seem to be your weak spots. QB seems pretty strong to me. Brees hasn't thrown for less than 4,300 yards since he's been in NO."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,losingfriends,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:19:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed on ODB.  If I had him I would be selling high as a kite right now.  ODB for Gronk straight up is a huge win to who gets Gronk IMO.  I agree with Breese.  Even if he does regress slightly due to age or the new ""run first system"" they're supposedly running he's still a QB 1 in a 10 team league.  No issues with Breese here.    Figure out who the best RB or TE you can get and either sell ODB high or else see if you can get rid of DT before his value falls."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,brandonfrank04,2,Thu Jul 2 18:33:53 2015 UTC,McKinnon and Michael do not help you this year at all. Sadly you missed the window of their highest value. But I would trade them for a producing vet..like Andre Johnson or Frank Gore.
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,JoshNipples,4,Thu Jul 2 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"By default, win now is trading young talent for older more proven talent. ODB, JJ, and DT are all solid and fairly young so you're good there, and I wouldn't trade them. I'd honestly trade Sammy for strong RB and a first round. You could probably even go Gore and 2 1st rounds. Sammy is an awesome talent, but no QB. He demands a high price and you could get a lot in return. But RB depth is your issue if you want to win now. QB is your issue if you want to win long term."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,aussiemac24,2,Thu Jul 2 12:33:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting team, not sure what I would do here."
DynastyFF,3bu6y9,TwoBucksMKE,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:43:21 2015 UTC,Sell Thomas eventually for a haul
DynastyFF,3buo2w,the_real_Alex14,3,Thu Jul 2 08:11:57 2015 UTC,"I think it is an even trade but I personally wouldn't do it. Even though Cutler's future is uncertain, I still like Alshon's QB situation better. Arian is an upgrade but Latavius has a chance to rise in value with a full season as a starter."
DynastyFF,3buo2w,ButSeri0usly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:32:45 2015 UTC,"Cutler is definitely good enough to keep feeding Jeffery.  In 2 years (after his guaranteed money is over), he's slated to make 12.5 and 13.5   The only reason the Bears would have to get rid of him at that point is if they found a better QB. Jeffery's situation is good for at least 5 more years"
DynastyFF,3buo2w,Zoten,3,Thu Jul 2 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"Don't bother. Murray might be living a hyped life right now but Alshon has legitimate long term WR1 potential. Although Watkins is an incredible player, he's going to be stuck in the Rex Ryan/Greg Roman coaching carousel that's going to have low volume passing, low volume scoring, and low quality QBing for at least the next two years (that's assuming they draft a rookie next year that has a temperate rookie year or sits, so this could be even longer). Foster is a great player but why give up two youths for a RB who's been heavily workhorsed in his career in addition to having his kind of injury history at that age? I'm sure Foster will put up decent numbers up until 31 but that's only when he's healthy.  Point being, just hold. At his worst Murray is a two down back who will start when healthy. Alshon could be a top 5 scorer in any year where his offense isn't terrible."
DynastyFF,3buo2w,NannigarCire,2,Thu Jul 2 08:59:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do it.  Watkins is still an unproven commodity while Alshon is a proven Top WR.  Murray may be young and hyped up right now, Foster is old and there's no telling how much longer he'll last.  I'd stick with Murray and Alshon."
DynastyFF,3buo2w,jgill41,2,Thu Jul 2 11:44:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do this IMO. You don't gain anything. Your downgrading WR significantly. If you're in win now mode and want Foster than trade Murray and picks, but I wouldn't let go of Alshon"
DynastyFF,3buo2w,aussiemac24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:41:22 2015 UTC,"Your RBs could quickly turn into nothing this year. Arian Foster will at least (barring injury) be pretty darn good this year. But you could wake up in week 5 and have zero value at RB.   I think Alshon's value is going to take a hit this year. I own him in a few leagues and I am not excited.   I think this trade is borderline even though...but if you don't like the assets coming your way...don't do it.   I would be a ""no."""
DynastyFF,3btdnx,Colonel_Buendia,5,Thu Jul 2 00:05:57 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on scoring. I'm in one league where Watt averaged 21 points per game and Quinn 11, and another where Watt averaged 9 and Quinn 5. In the first league, I would need more than 3 first rounders to trade Watt. In the second, I'd only maaaybe give a single mid first. You can't just ask ""what is Watt worth,"" you have to ask ""what is a particular point differential between DL #1 and DL #2 worth."" I'd want Quinn + 2 or 3 quality firsts in the first league, or Quinn plus a mid/late 1st in the second."
DynastyFF,3btdnx,blardorg,3,Thu Jul 2 02:27:25 2015 UTC,Mexico.  Would take a couple of 1sts.
DynastyFF,3btdnx,Mister__Sparkle,3,Thu Jul 2 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"If I had Watt, I wouldn't trade him. Number one IDP-player by far, scores nearly twice as much points as the next best defensive lineman.   There is nothing you could want more. Even a couple of firsts wouldn't change my mind."
DynastyFF,3btdnx,xxandl,2,Thu Jul 2 01:12:17 2015 UTC,I would never trade. Once in a lifetime player. Remember when LT had 42 touchdowns. How far ahead from the next RB he was that year is how far ahead Watt is every year
DynastyFF,3btdnx,fropek,2,Thu Jul 2 01:23:33 2015 UTC,Totally agree but do you have any stats on his points without the offensive touchdowns? All my leagues include them. Wondering if he comes back down to earth in that respect. I don't think he continues to destroy on them.
DynastyFF,3btdnx,Sticky_Z,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:47 2015 UTC,Over the last three years he has an average of 80 tackles and 17 sacks....   Even without TDs the gap between him and the next best DL is bigger than the gap between Gronk and the next best TE.
DynastyFF,3btdnx,xxandl,2,Thu Jul 2 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Last year he had 3 catches for 4 yards and 3 TD's. In PPR that's 21.4 points. In my moderately high scoring IDP league, not including offensive points, he had 390. The next closest DL... JPP with 230. After him, 196 for Mario Williams. So yeah, almost double the points of the 3rd highest scoring player at the position. That's a whole nother level of production that can not be found by any other single player."
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,terps973,3,Thu Jul 2 04:15:17 2015 UTC,I personally don't think the loss of peyton is as big a deal as everyone else does.  His YAC is one of the best in the league
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,Mrubuto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:55:50 2015 UTC,I dont either. I mean he had 80+ catches and over 1400 yards with Tim Tebow.
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,CheckedCoffee05,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"Good WR's can thrive under terrible QBs.   I will say though, I think Manning makes all the talent around him way better. He has always elevated folks. Thomas is solid, but is he really elite or does Manning make him elite?  I think everyone in Denver after Manning is a risk. They could completely change their offense, have to make huge cuts for salary considerations, go into full on rebuild...  I'd rather not live with that much risk. I don't own any Broncos."
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:42 2015 UTC,"Assuming Peyton's gone next year, I think you have to start comparing him to guys like Alshon, Hopkins, Watkins, and maybe Cooper. I think he's at least as good, if not better, than all of those guys and will likely have an equally questionable QB situation. He's a few years older than those guys, but I there's a good chance he's still got 3-4 years of WR1 production plus another few years and fantasy viability. I think he'll still be a mid-low dynasty WR1."
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,m_plis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"My issue with the idea that Peyton affects his value is that he had 94 catches for 1,434 yards with Tim Tebow at qb with Eric Decker on the roster. I think he is the one player on that team that wont be hurt when Peyton leaves"
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,CheckedCoffee05,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:40:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't 2011 the year Tebow started for them? If I remember correctly Thomas had like 500 yards the year Tebow was there. Thomas blew up the next year with Peyton in 2012 when he had 1400 yards.
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,Paloma_II,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:55:52 2015 UTC,true. my apologies. he was still averaging 17.2 yards per catch which is excellent. and he only played 11 games that year.
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,CheckedCoffee05,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:01:30 2015 UTC,Yeah with his yardage we would have had like 800 yards in 16 games so he wasn't a scrub. But he didn't become dominant until Peyton got there so I think it's fair to wonder if he can put up 1400+ yards and 10+ TDs after Peyton leaves only because it takes more than a good WR to make that happen.
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,Paloma_II,2,Mon Jul 6 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"True, but i think part of that was just how bad Tebow was. Nowadays even bad qbs throw for 3k yards. I think that would get him around 1200 and 8+ TDs which is still really good. His big thing is YAC anyways so they just ahve to get him the ball."
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,CheckedCoffee05,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:29:48 2015 UTC,Am I the only one around here who thinks Brock will be a pretty damn good QB?  DT will be great for the foreseeable future.
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,jbulkheader,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:53:40 2015 UTC,What about AJ Green?  I have a lot of people trying to work him off me.  Would you let him go for Hyde and Jimmy Graham?
DynastyFF,3bu4o8,LordSpilasquez,0,Mon Jul 6 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"He needs a very accurate quarterback. He already suffers from focus drops with Peyton putting the ball right on him 98/100 times. Everyone likes to say ""but he did fine with Tebow!"" and in reality his ypg were half what they are with Manning. I think it hurts his value and I think he's a fringe top 10 guy, but that also figures in the new ground and pound coaching style now in Denver."
DynastyFF,3bu0yy,Buxxtin,2,Thu Jul 2 03:40:06 2015 UTC,Is your trade mate the post right under this one?
DynastyFF,3bu0yy,Santidreet,2,Thu Jul 2 04:07:17 2015 UTC,If this dude is dumb enough to sell Charles/Knile/Olsen that cheap...take it!  Hell ask him for a 2 round rookie pick next year too.  He will probably be in the top 5 picks.  I'm staying far away from JT...and all other JAX offensive players for that matter.
DynastyFF,3bu0yy,gibbsftw,2,Thu Jul 2 12:02:06 2015 UTC,I would do this trade.   I think you get the better assets.
DynastyFF,3bu0yy,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:21:28 2015 UTC,I definitely like your team and I think JC will put you over the edge... having Knile only makes it jucier! For a win now and win soon team I would go with Olsen. Julius Thomas is TD dependent and they don't have too much of that in Jax
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,brandonfrank04,4,Wed Jul 1 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"I think OP wins the trade.  Sure he loses some youth, but look at his line up:  QB: Rodgers RB: Miller, L. Murray WR: Dez, Julio TE: Gronk FLEX: Nuk, G. Tate  If he doesn't win his league, something awful happened."
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,username02,3,Wed Jul 1 23:14:21 2015 UTC,I think team B wins.
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,xlShadylx,3,Wed Jul 1 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the responses to this thus far. Getting a top two QB is probably worth 'downgrading' Watkins for Tate (even though Tate easily outscored Watkins last year and considering all the factors could easily, and in fact most likely will, outscore Watkins again). Joseph Randle has some value, but not enough to stop me from grabbing Rodgers.  Trade makes no sense for B unless he has another top 5 QB.  Idk maybe people think Watkins is a top 10 guy and maybe he is but I'll sell on Tyrod Taylor's receivers and buy em back after their inevitable low volume year transpires."
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,peckx063,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think it makes least sense for Team B, Team A is paying a reasonable price for ARob and OP is net improving his team with ARod and Tate.   But if you think Randle will start for Cowboys and/or actually be startable in a 10 team league, then things change. I don't.   And as an aside, I don't know why everyone seems to automatically assume the starting Dallas RB will be practically as productive as Murray. No one has even remotely close to his combination of talent and ability."
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,blackngold14,2,Thu Jul 2 04:36:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I know I'm giving up long term value in tannehill and watkins. I really love tannehill but come on its Aaron cheese Jesus. I believe in the long run Watkins will be WAY better than tate but I want points now not in 4 years when he finally leaves buffalo. I thought it makes sense but team A considers himself a contender and doesn't want to give up tate. Looks like I'm riding in on tannehill.
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,eric_reid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"Team B definitely wins.   More importantly from your point of view, you are upgrading from Tannehill to Rodgers and downgrading from Watkins to Tate. It's debatable, but those alone aren't that far from cancelling out. Some would even prefer the Tannehill and Watkins side I'd imagine. Then you're just giving up what might be the Dallas starting RB."
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,JoshNipples,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:39:50 2015 UTC,I would not do this deal.   The difference between Rodgers and Tannehill isn't enough to cover losing the future difference of Sammy and potential value of Randle for what Tate does.   I don't think that adds up at all.
DynastyFF,3bsuvn,Dr_Lollygag,0,Fri Jul 3 07:01:29 2015 UTC,A and B are getting good deals while you get robbed.
DynastyFF,3btv7y,animesekaielric,3,Thu Jul 2 02:44:51 2015 UTC,"without knowing your roster I would probably say know, but that's because I think Kelce is gonna breakout in a big way this year and next  With that said, if you have a very young roster, but sitll have a guy like Jamaal Charles, then I would... you get Landry and Knile and Julius just serves as a starting TE"
DynastyFF,3btv7y,onlymycouchpullsout,2,Thu Jul 2 02:48:15 2015 UTC,"You're losing te3-5 for a top 20 ppr wr, a back up running back who's poised for the job or a starter (although I wouldn't trust New England), and a tight end who's proven he can do work, he just needs to find his niche (which Jacksonville might provide). Plus they paid Thomas a lot which means they want to use him a lot (and bortles will).   I say take it. Honestly, in start ups, Kelce and Landry are going in similar places already and the 2016 3rd doesn't make the difference for adding Julius Thomas and Blount or knife Davis. And if you don't own Jamal Charles, sell knife to the owner for some picks back if you want. Good value all around, would take 9/10 times (the 1 time I wouldn't is if I was stacked at wide receiver already and I didn't have a good back up tight end which is the rare case)"
DynastyFF,3btv7y,zadloo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:48:16 2015 UTC,To me it depends upon how much you like Landry.   I think Thomas' is a huge question mark. The other 2 RB's are huge risks to end up with zero value.   It's highly possible the only player of long term value coming back to you is Landry.   Is that worth Kelce minus the value of the TE you can replace him with?
DynastyFF,3btv7y,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes because I think Landry and Davis are really good pieces.   Even if Kelce breaks out, Julius Thomas will get a good amount of touchdowns and the difference between the two won't be that big. I'd especially take it you have a weak WR."
DynastyFF,3btil9,Caden16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"You're not close to winning this year, or next year for that matter.  I'd sell of Vets (Brady, Graham, Jennings) for young players and/or picks."
DynastyFF,3btil9,ZeroCool79,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:59:43 2015 UTC,The biggest advice you can get for dynasty is the value of top end WR's.  They last longer than RB's so they hold more value.  You've got some good rb's but your wr's suck.  Focus on improving them.  I'd sell off Graham for a top end WR from a win now team.
DynastyFF,3btil9,shack026,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"I actually really like your roster. Young and all with bright futures. I think the trades you've made had great value and I think the arob/Coleman for gurley is actually great value! I would definitely do that one since you're looking for the future.  Sell off guys like Brady, graham, and fleener for picks or younger players to just help the youth of your team in general. Expect to contend in 2 to 3 years and keep contending for the next 5 after that"
DynastyFF,3btil9,zadloo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"The lack of WRs is really going to hurt long term. I'd be looking through the rosters of the contenders for someone without a big name QB. As soon as Brady's appeal decision is announced (hopefully reduced) try to move him for a younger starting QB and a WR or future pick.  Rashad Jennings has some value to a RB needy team, shop him while he still does.  Someone already mentioned it below, but Graham for a WR1 would  do wonders for your roster. I'd be leery of acquiring J Randle for your team. He may not have much value past this season. You don't have to move a RB like Gurley. He could be special by next year."
DynastyFF,3btil9,LincolnSteve,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:40:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for advice! I will definitely look to move some of aging players for WR talent.
DynastyFF,3btil9,JoshNipples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:29:09 2015 UTC,"I like the first trade a lot.   You don't have a ""win now"" team. So any players who carry most of their value in this coming season should be shipped out.   Tom Brady, Jennings, Jimmy Graham being the obvious ones to me.   Get high picks or upside players.   Next years draft will have good QBS."
