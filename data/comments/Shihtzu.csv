Shihtzu,3e15sj,mxbmnn,4,Tue Jul 21 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"I have read on this subreddit that excessive licking is a shihtzu trait. My dog, ten years old now, has always been an excessive licker. Doors, floors, bed sheets, toes, you name it.  At least she listens when we tell her to stop, but we do have to tell her a few times a day.   It doesn't really bother me much anymore.  I only really watch out to make sure she doesn't lick her paws like that.  I wouldn't want her to lick herself raw.   As for the why, I'm not sure. Just seems to be a tick my dog has always had."

Shihtzu,3dscnc,jadanzzy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"Your vet should definitely be able to give more insight because it really could be a lot of things. But if you think it's something he's coming into contact with on your walks, maybe try some booties to protect them. How long has this been happening? If it's just the summer is it possible the surface is too hot and his paws are getting burned?  If booties don't help it might be a sign of something more serious. Ours has actually sprained his knee before jumping off the couch as well and had some similar reactions to the ones you're describing. Our vet told us it's safe to give them coated aspirin as well for pain so you might try that if this keeps happening."
Shihtzu,3dscnc,bananars,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  When this first happened, my wife said we need to get booties. I think we're gonna really get them now. When I take him to a park or something, this never happens. I oftentimes touch my hand to the ground to see if it's hot because I thought it might be that. Also our walks are 8am (mid 70s) and 8pm (mid 80s), so I might rule that out."
Shihtzu,3dlh5y,ColdestWintersChill,3,Fri Jul 17 06:02:41 2015 UTC,"My little Leroy does this! When he was a little puppy he used to just sit on the footpath and stare at me with his silly little round fluffy face. It got to the point where I tried to lure him along with a long stick smeared with peanut butter! He's gotten better as he's gotten older (he's now 17mo). He's better when there are 2 humans walking, or if his brother Pepe (12 mo old shihtzu Maltese probably poodle x) pulls him along on their double leash. Once he gets going he's fine. A front attached harness has helped, too, so you gently pull him from the front rather than have the leash go over his head. He is also an expert at slipping his collar when he's dragging behind, so a harness is much more secure.  Off the leash, he has much more energy, but still tires fairly quickly compared to Pepe and my parents' 5 yo poodle x Maltese. Leroy has the classic shihtzu short snout, which makes it harder to breathe, so he gets hot quicker. Nothing a good splash in a mud puddle won't fix, though!"
Shihtzu,3dlh5y,justakitty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:23:54 2015 UTC,"I did that too! I had a treat in front of him and just kept trying to lure him down the block for our ""walk."" I looked ridiculous"
Shihtzu,3dlh5y,moremileage,3,Sat Jul 18 02:07:05 2015 UTC,"Snow gets all excited to go outside. Then she just lays on the driveway. I have to force her into the grass to do anything! Inside she's a ball of fire that continually burns. When she's with my parents' beagle Bassett mix for walks she keeps up, surpasses, lays down, waits for us to catch up, the repeats. All on a 5 ft leash. At 9 months old, I figure she's just odd, maybe she'll grow out of it, maybe not. It's part of her personality."
Shihtzu,3dlh5y,TrueSlave21,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:43 2015 UTC,"My Moose does this when there are sharp temperature spikes. Hot days, even humid days, he just hates being warm lol. Moose is 10 years old though so this started when he was about 8."
Shihtzu,3dlh5y,heartshapesANDninjas,3,Fri Jul 17 12:33:03 2015 UTC,"Mine is the same...  she will run around and play fetch with us for hours but once we go outside, she puts the brakes on.  How old is your Shih Tzu?  Mine is 10 months old and is getting better; much better when two of us take her for a walk and she has someone else to follow.  We've started taking liver treats and breaking them in to super small pieces to reward her every few minutes of walking, that's helping a little.  We don't do this every time however as we don't want to maker dependant on the treats.  Make sure he/she is exercising doing whatever else for play time, and all is good.  It's nice to get those walks in though :)  Good time to meet some other pups for play!"

And that lovable pup will always be with you in memory.   And thank you for the advice and warning on teeth cleaning. Our girl is getting on in years, losing sight, hearing, and teeth it was a good reminder to stay vigilant."

Shihtzu,3d0d52,bokuse,2,Thu Jul 16 05:13:38 2015 UTC,"Well, she had been being treated for CHF for about a year and a half.  She had developed a cough and was having breathing issues (panting, wheezing) off and on for the past few years.  She was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and got over it after a bit.  At the time, we weren't able to afford all the X-rays and blood tests but she had probably started developing an infection then.  Vets had told me for years she needed a deep cleaning on her teeth but again, money was an issue.  Deep cleaning required her to be anesthetized and it was just too expensive plus as she got older it was too risky.  So one has her teeth developed an infection and the infection entered her bloodstream and went to her heart.  Just have your dog's teeth checked during her annual checkup and you should be fine!  Oh, and the first time I realized she was having dental issues was when she stopped eating.  Her mouth hurt."

Shihtzu,3cqa5d,emgeowagg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"I hope your dog is doing okay. Tbh, I'm a little confused  about why they would deny having an ingredient if it's clearly listed on the package.  Did you call Wrigley's again and what did they say about what happened?"
Shihtzu,3cqa5d,1000Airplanes,0,Fri Jul 10 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's exactly My problem too! When I called the woman was extremely concerned and said its Definatley a matter that needs sorting. She said each pellet contains 30mg of xylitol so it is in fact in the gum, a manager is going to speak to me on Monday x"
Shihtzu,3cqa5d,1000Airplanes,2,Sat Jul 11 09:12:00 2015 UTC,"Just curious about the call to Wrigley's? If the package says it contains xylitol, what are you expecting Wrigley's to do? They label things for human consumption. It is up to us, as dog owners, to keep an eye on them although that is impossible sometimes.  But why are you on a rampage about Wrigley's? I have mints all over the house specifically because they contain xylitol."
Shihtzu,3cqa5d,40ozkiller,0,Fri Jul 10 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"Because they have denied that the ingredient is in their gum to poison control when it clearly states that it is in there so how can they deny it. My problem is that if we didn't go to the vets but called poison control ourselves, they would say wrigleys said the ingredient isn't in the gum so maybe we wouldn't have gone to the vets and my dog would be dead by now. Instead, we went to the vets first. The vet had to ring tgem to find out how much xylitol was in each pellet of gum and the denied it was in there, but instead they said it wasn't in there."
Shihtzu,3cqa5d,alexalexthehuman,0,Fri Jul 10 21:58:00 2015 UTC,Is xylitol poisonous to humans? I feel bad for your four legged little one but I wonder if you're lashing out at the wrong thing.
Shihtzu,3cqa5d,bokuse,0,Sat Jul 11 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"nope it's just an artificial sweetener for humans but it's very poisonous to dogs. It's not that the gum conains it because I fully understand that it's for human consumption only, it's the fact that are denying the ingredient when it's all over their packaging so maybe her stomach pump could've been avoided if they told the truth"

Shihtzu,3a85eh,DrOCD,6,Wed Jun 17 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"My shih Tzu is the opposite, he will bring me toys to throw for him again and again, it lasts hours every day he never gets tired and when out walking he can run for hours. He's only 3 and a half though so maybe that's why.   On the other hand, my nana also has a shih tzu who's 7 and he's just like yours, he lies around all day. It could just be age but take him to the vet of you're worried.   The vet can also give you eye drops for the gunk too, it's a common problem with the breed."
Shihtzu,3a85eh,Charlieuk,3,Thu Jun 18 07:42:30 2015 UTC,"My shih tzu is also enormously lazy. He does everything you described your shih tzu does. Plus, his ears funk up easily too. He's done this his whole life, he's also 7. He's very princess like when it comes to his preferences. The most action you get from him all day is if the water isn't dumped and refreshed upon his command. He stamps his feet and mumble barks until you do his bidding. I'm his slave."
Shihtzu,3a85eh,penguinwiggles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"The ear funk could be a result of water in the ears. I switched to something that removes water, and his ears stay clean now."
Shihtzu,3a85eh,alexalexthehuman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we got some powder from the vet for that. =) What do you use?"
Shihtzu,3a85eh,penguinwiggles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:02:23 2015 UTC,It's called Vet's Best. It's two step. The first step is a cleaner and the second turns all moisture into a sort of powder that you just wipe out. I usually use a q-tip to get in there. He makes noses (like when he's relaxed or sleeping) so I think it feels good for him.
Shihtzu,3a85eh,alexalexthehuman,2,Thu Jun 18 20:05:40 2015 UTC,I swear my shih tzu once slept for 24 hours straight. He is just a lazy dog. He is older but I  got him when he was 8 and he was never active then either. I would say that he normally sleeps between 20 and 22 hours a day. The vet says he is fine.  He gets eye gunk as well. It's just allergies.  I  have drops but he hates them. I just wipe his face with a damp washcloth
Shihtzu,3a85eh,mycreativename,2,Thu Jun 18 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"Don't know about lethargy but the eye gunk is like the most common problem with the breed due to their short muzzles, i.e. faces being more exposed than in most other breeds. Just get some eye drops from the vet, it's not a big deal."
Shihtzu,3a85eh,renome,2,Fri Jun 19 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"My Shih Tzu is 10 1/2 years old. He is a senior citizen by dog standards, so I'm not going to push him. But if I take him out with me of course he is going to follow along, it's not that he can't be active (Shih Tzus don't require a lot of exercise either compared to larger dogs. They are ideal pets for living in an apartment because the small space is adequate enough to give themselves the exercise they need). Left to his own devices, he loves to just laze around and sleep, or work on a bone, or like yours, eat, beg, relieve himself, etc. If your dog is tired even just to go for a short walk, etc. then a vet visit is in order. Otherwise pretty normal for the breed and age not to necessarily be running around for no reason.  The eye gunk is a common problem with breeds that have flat faces (i.e. Shih Tzu, Pug, etc.) because the tear ducts that drain the excess fluid from the eye through to the nose block up so easily, as the nose is squashed in. The excess fluid stains, and that's why it's common to see reddish brown marks around the eyes on a Shih Tzu, unless it is a show dog where the owner is purposely taking action against to prevent it.  There is a product that causes the fluid to become clear so that it does not stain, but it's active ingredient is an antibiotic, so the FDA has come out against it as it could cause resistance to antibiotics and potentially start a superbug. I'm not going to put my dog's health at risk just to look pretty.  I just use wet wipes with no chemicals (except H2O) in it to give clean around the eye once a day. Keeps the problem in check.   In your case I would just have the wipes close by and give him a quick wipe around the eyes when you sit next to him (make sure you give him a reward for getting his eyes wiped as positive re enforcement, as it is a bit uncomfortable for them and they can quickly learn to hate it if they don't associate it with reward)"
Shihtzu,3a85eh,SimonGn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"I think the eye gunk issue depends on the breeder quality. My first Shih Tzu who lived a good 13 years had that problem and she was from a littler of not so pure bred dogs, plus she was the runt in her litter. My current Shih Tzu was born from a litter of pure bred show dog Shih Tzu's and she doesn't have the issue at all. Smelly ears are a problem with all of them though it seems."
Shihtzu,3a85eh,TheLostBeerKeg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"My Shih Tzu definitely isn't pure breed, poor conformation in fact, and he's never had smelly ears! Didn't even know about that problem though, thanks!"

You have to remember, they were originally bred to be foot warmers for Tibetan monks so it's in their DNA to just lay there.  Perfectly normal!  One of the reasons I prefer shih tzus--they aren't all yippy, running around like wind-up toys!"

Shihtzu,39ssir,albritt9078,4,Sun Jun 14 12:27:08 2015 UTC,"I have a 10 year old Shih-tzu who's trained as a therapy dog and can pass any obedience test with flying colors.   But get her in the park, or her front yard and yell ""come!"", and you get a whole different reaction.  The look she gives me says, ""What's in it for me?""  If there's a tree, she'll saunter behind it to break the line of sight. The smarter they are, the more tricks they'll invent to extend ""me time.""  Best bet? Keep treats in your pocket."
Shihtzu,39ssir,urbanek2525,3,Sun Jun 14 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"Recalls take months of proofing to be trusted. You need to really take the time to work on it. I'm a certified trainer, and I've taken a few recall seminars if you're interested in me going over the steps with you. It takes a lot of work, you're going to be overwhelmed with the information, but a solid recall is possible for most dogs to learn.  Puppies are not born understanding what we want from them. Cues need to be taught first in a low distraction area, and then they need to be proofed by working on the three D's - Duration, Distance, Distraction. Cues take weeks and months to solidify. You need to work on cues from scratch in a new areas. That is the only way your puppy will understand your words.  Motivation is important. You need to motivate your puppy to obey you using treats and praise as rewards. Be exciting, be happy, make training fun. Would you work for no money? No, you'd quit your job if your boss stopped paying you. Dogs need to be paid for their work too! Without payment, what's the point? Some dogs are comfortable being rewarded with praise only, but many dogs need other motivators like food and toys. You have to figure out what truly motivates your dog, and use that as a reward, and don't be stingy! Try different treats like hotdogs, cheese sticks, cooked white meat chicken, all cut into tiny pea sized pieces.  Make it fun for your dog to pay attention to you. Play the ""name game"" by saying your dogs name, clicking (if you use a clicker) and treating. Do this repeatedly for a few days throughout the entire day with around 100-200 small treats. The more you work on this, the quicker your dog will happily respond to her name being called. As soon as she hears her name, she'll come looking for you in hopes of a treat! At first, for the first few days, you reward every time she looks at you after you say her name. After that, reward randomly instead of every time. Be sure to still reward occasionally even when she is responding to her name 100% of the time, because you want to keep her interested in playing the name game with you."
Shihtzu,39ssir,jourtney,2,Sun Jun 14 17:32:27 2015 UTC,100% this.
Shihtzu,39ssir,gallie_frayed,3,Mon Jun 15 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"Our shihtzu won't come reliably when called, he doesn't leave the house without a leash."
Shihtzu,39ssir,tenormore,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:00:07 2015 UTC,I've had my shih tzu for over 9 years and I'm the same way with her too. These dogs are just stubborn enough at just the wrong time and that's how they get in trouble.
Shihtzu,39qbra,peruytu,4,Sat Jun 13 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Your dog is cooped up in a human house all day. When she gets outside, she needs to interact with other animals. She does this by smelling the scents they have left behind. Think of it as checking her facebook. ""Oh look, Sharon has a new boyfriend"" 'Kevin is on a new diet"" ""Looks like Casey is pregnant again"" As one trainer calls it, they are reading their ""pee-mail"". Let her do this. Its important for her socialization, especially if she doesn't have other dogs at home. Give her 10 min to sniff things out, then get her walking."
Shihtzu,39qbra,JadedFlowers,2,Tue Jun 16 12:51:11 2015 UTC,"Good point. She is in the house all day as my girlfriend and I are at work all day. But we do take her for daily walks and we make it priority to take her to the park once or twice every weekend so she can run around. For this we're also thinking of getting a puppy friend for her; just not now as our lease doesn't allow it. But once we move out of our current place, we plan on adopting a friend for her. Thanks for the insight."
Shihtzu,39qbra,JadedFlowers,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:58:25 2015 UTC,You're welcome. Good luck. I would check out this book/author rather than Cesar Milan.
Shihtzu,39qbra,MrBlueMeany,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:00:52 2015 UTC,"The thing you have to realize is that although dogs are another member of the family they are not people and do not react or have the same understanding as people. Which means that although you give your dog shelter and feed it and give it affection, to your dog this does not necessarily mean that it should respect you. What garners a dogs respect and attention is when you act like its pack leader. If you want to see examples on how to show your dog that you are its pack leader I'd recommend watching Cesar Milans videos. I've applied these ideas when interacting with my dog and walking is an extremely pleasant experience."
Shihtzu,39qbra,gallie_frayed,-1,Sat Jun 13 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"Believe, I know all about Cesar Milan, and I've tried of his techniques. But there's no technique that teaches how to make her run towards pee and poo to sniff. As hard as try, no matter what I do to focus on the walk, she will race towards the pee and poo... as if her life depended on it."
Shihtzu,39qbra,gallie_frayed,4,Sat Jun 13 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"Please do not buy into the Cesar Milan/Dominance theory stuff. It's been debunked time and time again and is an incredibly outdated and potentially dangerous approach to training. It's not going to help your dog in general and it's especially not going to help your dog in this scenario.   Read more about why it's been debunked here.  Dogs enjoy walks for different reasons. Some dogs are all about the forward motion, going somewhere, etc. Some dogs are more like the people at a museum who feel the need to read every single placard posted on the wall. Dog pee and poo holds a lot of interesting information, to a dog. I tell the students in my classes that it's kind of like doggie Facebook. Your shih tzu's interest in it is 100% normal and natural.  Now, I completely understand wanting to be more productive on walks and it's something you can certainly train for. Right now, wherever you're taking your pup on a walk is way too distracting. It's like the boss level of a video game. You need a nice, distraction-free starting zone. So if you can, try practicing walking in a place like an empty parking lot. Use a prompt to let your dog know you're about to start walking (like ""let's go"" or ""forward"") and start moving. If your pup moves with you, reward that behavior with something they like. A small, soft treat works wonders. (Don't worry, you won't need treats forever. Food is just a strong reinforcer when trying to train a new behavior). If your dog looks up at you while you're walking—AWESOME—reward that behavior. And you can even use sniffing as a reward. Dog goes across the parking lot with you without stopping—let her go to the bushes at the edge and sniff her little heart out!  As it gets easier to accomplish walking without stopping in the middle of a parking lot, increase the difficulty a bit. Walk along the edge, where there are a few more smells, etc...   Training a new behavior takes time, but it's worth it. If you're getting frustrated, seek out a responsible trainer in your area. And a responsible trainer would never recommend Cesar Milan."
Shihtzu,39qbra,MrBlueMeany,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:35:43 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! This exactly what I was looking for. I will start this week. Thankfully I have a large parking lot next to my place. Thank again!
Shihtzu,39qbra,rabidxglow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"No problem! Happy to help! If you want to do more reading, check out information regarding ""loose leash walking"" or LLW. Most people struggle with dogs pulling (and maybe if you had a St. Bernard instead of a Shih Tzu, the sniffing would also be a bit of a pulling problem)—but the desired, end result is the same: a nice walk on a loose leash.  In general, when you encounter a problematic behavior with your dog, try to figure out what's working for the dog. Dogs who tip over the garbage do it because it's delicious. Dogs who sniff a lot on walks do it because it's enjoyable and they're learning a lot about the other pups in the neighborhood. As an owner/trainer, it's your job to make what you'd rather the dog be doing more rewarding/more fun.  If you want some professional trainers to search out for guidance and/or reading material, here's my go-to list:   Sophia Yin Jean Donaldson Patricia McConnell Karen Pryor Ian Dunbar Pat Miller   And for tv/celebrity trainers, stick with Victoria Stilwell."

Granted, they're both females and there's less of an age difference than with your situation, but our older dog was also afraid of the puppy for a few days.  We took away toys and gave them both their own ""territories"" at first, but within a week, they were inseparable. So much so that the puppy won't even go into her own crate at this point; they sleep together, they eat side-by-side, and when we go for walks or to the store, the baby is right on her ""sister's"" hip at all times. There are still some instances here and there of roughhousing, and our puppy also instigates playtime when the older dog doesn't want to be bothered, but we just try to redirect. Ours also get jealous and one will magically appear from another room to butt in when the other is getting attention, but they've never been hostile about it.  To me, as long as there's no outright aggression and he's not hiding under the bed in fear, Sulley will adjust.  Congratulations!"

Never met before. Pollux was already 1 years old and Castor was almost turning 1. Pollux is very socialized but when Castor came into his territory, I never seen him act the way he did. He was so jealous and would pounce at Castor if he tried to get pets from anyone. Castor was shy/scared but wanted to play with Pollux. There were tons of growls and barks at first but now they play with each other just fine. Pollux is smaller but is still the alpha dog haha.

It's pretty obvious jet fuel can't melt steel beams alone but when the steam beam has a fucking building on it that weakens the structural integrity when hot and they sheared off. Thats what caused the collapse, not melted through. Any engineer can't explain that, that's why it was never a mainstream issue. Only people that beat that drum are trolls. But your dog is cute"

Shihtzu,36abmw,jefferyffe,3,Sun May 17 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Probably allergies. Did it start suddenly? If so you might try to remember anything you've changed recently like shampoo. If not the vet can prescribe steroid pills that will help.
Shihtzu,36abmw,ScottsTot1,2,Sun May 17 19:52:22 2015 UTC,Wonderful thank you for the advice.
Shihtzu,36abmw,Xeeroy,2,Sun May 17 19:56:36 2015 UTC,My moms shih tzu had that since she was one year old (she recently turned 3) and it was allergies as well that she needs some stupidly expensive specially made medicine for and apparently it was such a big deal she had to be spayed so she can't have puppies.
Shihtzu,36abmw,analwound,3,Mon May 18 09:20:17 2015 UTC,Agree with everyone else. Probably allergies. We get our boy steroids when it is really bad and the rest of the year when he is itchy he gets 1/2 a benadryl in the morn. Check with the vet is your best option
Shihtzu,36abmw,ameliagillis,3,Mon May 18 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"Skin issues are one of the most complex things to diagnose in dogs. It's mose likely allergies, could be environmental (brought on by spring) or food related (have you changed the diet recently? Animal protein is a common allergen). There could be a secondary bacterial/yeast infection to the allergies caused by broken skin, hormones, you name it. Antibiotics may be indicated in such a situation. There could be other conditions such as hot spots, seborrhea, dry skin, fleas, mites, etc etc etc. I recommend a trip to the vets. If the itching drives you crazy, imagine how crazy its driving your dog!"

Shihtzu,36abmw,VioletNewstead,2,Mon May 18 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of things like dry skin or allergies or something else, but I bet your local vet would know best. It would probably be a good idea to take him to make sure he's okay. Mine does the crazy scratching too (due to dry skin) and we have him wear a sweater or t-shirt to keep him from hurting himself."

My little girl penny is 5 now and she still licks everything. We just tell her no licking and try to mostly keep from licking herself so she does not give her self sores. Unfortunately there isn't much that stops them. The culprit shown below. :)  http://i.imgur.com/XFoZBY9.jpg
Shihtzu,368c7t,anj91,3,Sun May 17 04:44:41 2015 UTC,Yea He has gotten a sore once. Had to deal with that. Here's my little hellraiser. http://i.imgur.com/LUO4rPA.jpg
Shihtzu,368c7t,anj91,2,Sun May 17 04:56:16 2015 UTC,He's darling!! Something I think helps is keeping there hair short. It keeps food particles and anything else that might get stuck in longer hair out so it doesn't bother them.
Shihtzu,368c7t,Chinchillita,3,Sun May 17 05:26:18 2015 UTC,Mine just turned 4 this year and she has started doing the same thing. Luckily she hasn't given herself any sores. I try to distract her with toys when she starts licking leg.

Shihtzu,368c7t,mx440,1 point,Sun May 17 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"Ours licks quite a bit (people, the couch etc) but for a while she would just wander around and lick the concrete floor endlessly which was concerning to me. I cannot find anything with a quick google search but I remember reading something that said it may indicate a lack of nutrients in the diet so just in case that was the culprit I switched her food and sure enough she stopped. Sounds like there are plenty of other pups here that just love to lick though so maybe it is a Shih Tzu trait!"

Shihtzu,359asd,_konvikt_,2,Fri May 8 04:31:18 2015 UTC,We free feed our 2.5 year old.  She's a healthy 10lbs.  She tells us when she wants more food by bringing or pointing to her bowl and jingling her water bottle when she wants more fresh/cold water.  She eats 1/4-1/2cup of royal canin shih tzu food and either a scrambled egg or 2oz of roasted chicken for breakfast with a few treats throughout the day.

Molly and Birdie would be fine free fed, but because Sam is a fatty (he's 20 pds, but the vet said he should be 17/18) and would eat everything, we feed them some in the morning then again at dinner."

Shihtzu,359asd,MidnightWonderland,1 point,Fri May 8 11:24:52 2015 UTC,"My shih tzu / maltese is 7 years old, weighing 17 lbs.  Vet says she is at a healthy weight but that she should not gain anymore weight.  She eats breakfast 6 am and then dinner at 8 pm.  I just fill her bowl up and she'll eat until she feels satisfied, I don't have to restrict her.  Most of the time she doesn't finish her food, she's super well behaved and will stop herself when she is satisfied.  Often times she'll just eat half her bowl and then drink her water, which is normal for her.  I just leave food in her bowl at all times and she'll eat whenever she feels like it."

She is free fed, but she doesnt over-eat.  we have two australian shepherds and Anna rules over them, even though they tower over her. she steals their toys all the time, and they kinda get close but always back off.  She always come to me with a certain look in her eyes. which means she needs to go outside.  Such a great dog.

Shihtzu,2zvoz2,monkeypunk98,8,Sun Mar 22 05:27:09 2015 UTC,"No, mine has always been very loving.  It sounds like your Bruno is scared/threatened by you-esp. if you are getting too close in his face for his comfort, so when he is scared/threatened he first tries to growl and assert himself but then he feels like you are still attacking him so he rolls over on his back(a classic sign of doggie submission) hoping that you will see HE is not a threat to YOU and will give him his space.   All dogs have different personalities...your shih tzu may be poorly bred(because Shih Tzu temperament is supposed to be friendly, loving everyone even strangers according to AKC breed standards) or maybe your dog is just having some adjustment issues/doesn't like a perfume you are wearing/just happens to be an outlier for the Shih Tzu breed temperament standard.  You should consult a certified animal behaviorist to do an in home visit and figure out what Bruno needs to feel more confident and comfy."
Shihtzu,2zvoz2,JustTryingToMaintain,2,Sun Mar 22 06:31:03 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Also check out /r/Dogtraining

Shihtzu,2zle11,waggytalk,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:35:33 2015 UTC,Just found this place!  We have a 4 month old. We got her for my daughter (12) because her toy poodle passed away.   the dog though has become mine. i was dead set against getting it. but once we got it i have to admit i fell in love with the little thing.   though i do have one question. This dog is the hardest thing i have ever house broken. she will go great for a few days then have a few off. is this normal? or is she just being a little butthead?
Shihtzu,2zle11,VioletNewstead,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's normal, with any dog breed. Puppies don't have full control of their bladders until they are at least 6 months old. Time, patience, and diligence are all extremely important when potty training a puppy- it's not going to happen overnight. Look at it this way- would you expect a four month old baby to be able to control their bladder? Of course not."
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,sayITwitYOchest,5,Thu Mar 19 05:29:58 2015 UTC,"Shih-Tzu's are the absolute worst beggars ever; they stare at you with their big, cute, ewok faces and don't stop staring till you give them food"
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,ColdestWintersChill,3,Thu Mar 19 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"Not mine. they have never tasted human food and never seem to realize it's edible. At first, as puppies, they would be interested in it but a stern no and removing the food from their sight and eating in the other room quickly fixed that. Now, they don't even look twice at me while eating. They also know to stay out of my lap while eating after getting them off me multiple times. Shih tzus are very intelligent :)  I once tested it while drunkenly cooking one night. I dropped a little meat on the ground and just looked at my pup. He looked at it, looked at me, and just sat there."
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,gurbur,2,Thu Mar 19 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"Guess my parents didn't train ours so well about that, but he makes up for it by never barking, always cuddling, never being angry or aggressive, and just giving love love love. Ugh, I miss my ShihTzu, he's with my parents right now -_-"
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,ColdestWintersChill,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"I gave up on mine, I've never fed him from my plate, but once in awhile I do give my dogs leftovers (in their bowl).  He knows not to beg, but if I leave my plate unattended where he can get at it and he knows he has time (like if I'm on the phone) he will/would help himself (I no longer leave that option available).  Now my English Springer Spaniel on the other hand, I could set a steak in front of her and she won't touch it unless I tell her 'go ahead'.  They are extremely smart, and everything you said above about the cuddling, etc."
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,evanessa,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Mine has learned I'm a bad bet for food.... My fiance gives him stuff, so guess who gets all the attention at meal time?  I sometimes wish we had stuck with the rule of not allowing the dog on the couch while we're eating (on the couch)."
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,macbalance,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:57:13 2015 UTC,Everything is about consistency when it comes to training dogs. And it's never too late! You can always bring a new house rule for them to get used to.
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,gurbur,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:38:24 2015 UTC,"Mine is the same way. He's barely interested in his own food, much less people food."
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,kevinxb,2,Thu Mar 19 22:13:36 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm pretty good with sticking to his dog food, but look at him.. I give in once in awhile haha."
Shihtzu,2zk2ar,evanessa,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:27:50 2015 UTC,He is adorable.
Shihtzu,2zi9va,IHeartmyshihtzu,4,Wed Mar 18 20:21:50 2015 UTC,He's so cute!!

Shihtzu,2zabhr,ColdestWintersChill,0,Tue Mar 17 00:27:23 2015 UTC,He's soft like a shihtzu
