baldursgate,3e4l70,Drea-Nor,8,Tue Jul 21 22:25:58 2015 UTC,Pathfinding changes :-D
baldursgate,3e4l70,Raudskeggr,4,Tue Jul 21 22:26:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, pathfinding, as in characters in the game...  For a minute, I was confused and worried."
baldursgate,3e4l70,80-,6,Wed Jul 22 02:15:35 2015 UTC,This is great; thanks for posting.  Can you (or someone) post a recap/TLDW for those that won't get 28 minutes of spare time?
baldursgate,3e4l70,Raudskeggr,4,Tue Jul 21 23:48:22 2015 UTC,I want the exact same thing but I'm swamped.  Hoping there's some good Samaritan with time out there
baldursgate,3e4l70,jacqueofalltrades,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:56 2015 UTC,I still have been playing Weidu on my old non-enhanced version of BG; this new content might make me want to try out the enhanced edition after all.
baldursgate,3e4l70,Myrag,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"I Like how they were all sort of making fun of the interviewer by saying ""yes"" and she didn't seem to get it at all haha.   Besides that, I'm interested to see how going into BG2 at lvl 12 will affect the game."
baldursgate,3e2ftu,Tartantyco,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:06 2015 UTC,I don't have source but I think it is dependent on your amount of experience.
baldursgate,3e2ftu,ReversalofGraves,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"According to every source I can find, as well as my own personal experience, it's based on your level, not your XP."
baldursgate,3e2ftu,PandaBouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, but it should use the highest level class of your multiclass hero."
baldursgate,3e2ftu,gangler52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:30 2015 UTC,This actually just came up on a thread I was in the other day.  It apparently averages your levels. So you 2/3 ranger/cleric would be considered level 2.5 for the purpose of recruitment. Not quite high enough to hit that 3 marker and get the level 4 Ajantis.
baldursgate,3e3bfp,parkufarku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:32 2015 UTC,Thanks. How easy is it to edit kits in the EE versions? I was able to do it all the time in GOG versions through NEAR and Infinity Explorer.
baldursgate,3e3bfp,Myrag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:28 2015 UTC,So from RP perspective you want to go behind your enemy and pinch his kidney with your bare fingers... ?
baldursgate,3e3bfp,BDX_LAW,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:27:00 2015 UTC,"Hide in shadows is handy for scouting, so it's not entirely wasted.   Anyway, I don't believe that the backstab multiplier can be changed, or added, via EEkeeper. I've looked in the menus before and haven't found anything to change it. I may be wrong though."
baldursgate,3e3bfp,luke_luke_luke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"The monk has excellent THAC0 (THAC0 progression of a fighter) and high damage potential without backstab.   The thief class is balanced on the fact that their damage and THAC0 is not meant to be as good as a monk/fighter in melee, so the backstab bonus compensates.  The stealth is obviously useful to scout ahead (which is good as the monk is normally faster than your non-boots-of-speed companions), but you also get the +4 THAC0 bonus, which is still powerful.  That being said, the monk is still probably the worst kit in BG:EE, not that I'm complaining, you just need to grit your teeth and fantasize about the solo rampages you will do at level 20."
baldursgate,3e3t88,high_ride36,6,Tue Jul 21 19:10:00 2015 UTC,If it is your first play through I would leave Minsc in the sheer entertainment value.
baldursgate,3e3t88,dopplegangerexpress,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:21 2015 UTC,"If for whatever reason he doesn't do it for you, though, the more bland NPC Valygar is pretty fierce.  Or what the comment says below...with your team Keldorn makes sense."
baldursgate,3e3t88,lcfparty15,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:53 2015 UTC,If you're going to drop Minsc I would recommend Keldorn. His paladin abilities are useful and he can wield (minor spoiler) Carsomyr.
baldursgate,3e3t88,FirkraagTheRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think you have too many clerics and too many thieves. I'd drop Jan for Aerie (Nalia's thieving skills aren't great, but they'll do you just fine until you get Imoen back - I assume you'll be going to get her relatively fast, rather than doing a lot of side quests first).   As for Anomen and Viconia, I don't love using either of them because they just spend too much time as clerics. I would probably grab Kelodrn and Jaheira instead. That leaves you with:  CHARNAME Imoen (Nalia) Minsc Keldorn Jaheira Aerie  That's maybe a little light on mages - feel free to swap Jaheira for Edwin, Neera, or Nalia, I would say."
baldursgate,3e3t88,pipkin42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"The party would work well, but there is a bit of redundancy.  You don't need Anomen and Viconia.  You don't need Jan Jensen if you have Nalia/Imoen, and having Imoen as your only mage isn't ideal, as when you normally pick her up she is hideously underlevelled. You can easily have him though.  It's useful to have a party of 5 or less, as you can then do all the potential companion quests easily, before ditching them after the quest is done."
baldursgate,3e3t88,luke_luke_luke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"Anomen does nothing for your party composition. You would be better off with haer'dalis. He's very versatile and can fit into any composition. Don't underestimate his skill with thrown weapons, particularly if you give him something to augment his strength."
baldursgate,3e36i8,sixteenbiticon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"No, but there should be autohotkey rerollers you can find on google that will store and track such values and can be set with a minimum to accept."
baldursgate,3e36i8,sfwtimes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind activating cheats, you can do that much more easily.   Open the baldur.ini file in a text editor like Notepad. Add the line Cheats=1, then save and quit. Press Ctrl+8 once you're in the ability screen during character creation to set all ability scores to their maximum. This takes into consideration racial and class limits, i.e. an elf will have his DEX set to 19, an Avenger's STR and CON will still only be 16, and so on. Also, it will set the exceptional STR for the character to its maximum even if that character isn't eligible to exceptional STR. In other words, an elven mage will still get STR 18(75). Now simply reduce the ability scores until you're happy, and continue with character creation. You do NOT have to spend remaining points you substracted from the abilities."
baldursgate,3e1mpr,XcomNewb,3,Tue Jul 21 07:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, no and no.   BGEE 2 includes ToB.  You can't grandmaster flails as cleric, you have to that as berserker and then dualclass.  You'll regain your pips when your cleric hits 1 level higher than the level you dualclassed from berserker. What happens is that you get all your former class abilities but continue to level as a cleric, ie. whatever pips and abilities, while still only able to level as a cleric and still subject to it's restrictions."
baldursgate,3e1mpr,Triksain,3,Tue Jul 21 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"You'll still be restricted to weapon choices available to clerics, but you should be able to go beyond the ""proficient only"" restriction in those weapons once you regain your fighter levels."
baldursgate,3e1mpr,errboi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:50 2015 UTC,That is what I am saying...
baldursgate,3e1mpr,Triksain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I just felt like your explanation was a little bit ambiguous about that, since I considered the lack of weapon specialization one of the restrictions clerics are subject to. My bad."
baldursgate,3e1mpr,errboi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see that. Both the wording of the original question and my answer aren't completely specific. I read the post to mean ""Is ToB part of BGEE 2?"", ""Can I grandmaster as cleric?"" and ""Will my pips be set to 2 max when dualclassing?""."
baldursgate,3e1mpr,Triksain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:36 2015 UTC,Your clarification/addition of information was helpful. Thanks for it.
baldursgate,3e1mpr,AdonisChrist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"you can grand master your weapon, with 3 points to spare(probably for two weapon style)"
baldursgate,3e1mpr,Fusrodahmus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:30 2015 UTC,After you hit 14 as Cleric and regain your Berserker class you will be able to go past 2 pips again.
baldursgate,3e1mpr,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:15:53 2015 UTC,So if I'm understanding this right.  When I dual I lose all my levels and I become a Cleric.   When I go past my Fighter levels I get all of my proficiency  points that I invested back (so if I gm'ed flails as fighter then when I hit 14 cleric it will be gm'ed again.) and I can grandmaster weapons as a Fighter/Cleric
baldursgate,3e1mpr,my_nan_is_boss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:57 2015 UTC,Yes. If you're a fighter and you duel at level ten you'd be unable to use those abilities you've invested in until after your hit level ten with your second class.
baldursgate,3e1mpr,errboi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:59 2015 UTC,I think you actually need to reach level 11 in your new class to regain those abilities.
baldursgate,3e1mpr,my_nan_is_boss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:38 2015 UTC,Oh you may be right. I was battling with myself as to whether it was one higher or not. But yeah. That.
baldursgate,3e1mpr,PandaBouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"Just put 5 points in weapon while leveling as warrior. When you get it back you will have those 5 pips back. Normaly in BG2 you wouldn't be able to go past 2 points as dual, you had to mod it. Dunno how it is in BG2EE, since I still play vanilla version with mods."
baldursgate,3e139d,Arabellah16,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:47 2015 UTC,Dude. Same thing with me and BG2. Both playthroughs I got to when you talk to the vampire girl at end of act2 or act3 and my HD died. I am starting to think BG2 does something weird to HDs. I have never finished it
baldursgate,3e139d,svperstarr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:58 2015 UTC,"Anomen   Ugh, that whiny dude.  I recently killed him because he wouldn't shut up about not becoming a knight, and also just killed Jahiera because i went back to speak with her and she attacked me randomly.    Playing a good character / party, but some of these companions really make it difficult to be nice."
baldursgate,3e139d,DrAwesomeClaws,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"Oh man, everyone hates on anomen, he's probably one of favourite NPCs. Have you ever explored the results of his personal quest? There's at least three outcomes iirc, and they affect his my quite considerably."
baldursgate,3e139d,Psudopolis,2,Tue Jul 21 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"My condolences. I feel the way you do about Jehiera to my Rasaad. Such a noble beast you were.  Incidently, I never play with the paladin Keldorn because I don't want him to be sad after the game. I just leave him to sort things out after doing his side-quest.  I like Nalia and Imoen's ending, they seem to get their stuff together."
baldursgate,3e1o3a,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:13 2015 UTC,"That would break BG1, so no. IIRC SCS is the best option for actual tactics one has. I think you're thinking of something else here."
baldursgate,3e1o3a,DMZ_Dragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:24 2015 UTC,I've never seen one.  If you specify whether it's for the originals or not I'm sure someone could be more definitive.
baldursgate,3e09od,Larlock1,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what you've done already. It's always smart to gather as much gear as possible. As such, you might explore the area surrounding the firewine bridge, kill bassilus, do the greywolf quest outside the mines, that sort of thing.  The easiest and fastest xp is probably farming ankhegs in the cave in the farmlands north of the friendly arm inn. They are extremely susceptible to sleep and command, and they are worth 975 xp each. Just rest in the cave, they'll bother you nearly every time"
baldursgate,3e09od,Fusrodahmus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:57 2015 UTC,That's genius! I've never heard about that before. I'm definitely going to grind exp and gold that way from now on once I recruit the underlevelled (relatively) Yeslick and/or Quayle.
baldursgate,3e09od,luke_luke_luke,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"That, and the drake cave in Cloakwood are the easiest ways to farm XP. They're useful for gaining a level or two for your dual-classed characters, but beyond that you have to ask whether resting 50 times in a row is role-playing, and would it just be easier to set your level with EEKeeper at that point."
baldursgate,3e09od,Rookie01,2,Wed Jul 22 00:24:22 2015 UTC,I liked the flesh golem cave better than the ankheg and wyvern ones. 2000xp a piece and I could usually last some eight of them before a healing nap became essential.
baldursgate,3e09od,FrisianDude,5,Wed Jul 22 07:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. Do all the sword coast stuff if you have a party of at least 2-3 who can wear platemail. Any map below Beregost except Durlag's tower should be completely explored as you won't care enough to do it later. Unfortunately this isn't a quest orientated part of the game. This is a loot/experience/exploration grinding part of the game. The (what I think are interesting and important) things to do are   getting the charisma tome getting the constitution tome getting the exp from the basilisks and sirens the gauntlets and the mage fight at the firewine bridge helping the small dudes at Gullykin village helping the spooky ghost at Ulcaster helping Samuel and getting the ring at gibberling mountains. helping the girl find her cat and the boy find his dog south-west of Nashkel. kill some red wizards (not related to Neera's story-line) eastish of Beregost helping the farmer save his cow north of the circus. learn how to wertle-woo or whatever at the shipwreck, and speak to the surgeon who has a plot-relevant brother. save some boy at the lighthouse from wolves for a reputation boost. kill the evil chicken become an archaeologist help the captain of Nashkel defeat Bassilus south of high hedge before his family grows   edit: I assume you have already saved the damsel in distress or hired a wizard for a year, you have already spoken with the artist at Nashkel mines, and you have already explored the crypts where you exited the Nashkel mines."
baldursgate,3e09od,luke_luke_luke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:15 2015 UTC,Could I jump in and ask a question?  I've completed a handful of the quests you've mentioned (I'm around the same place as OP). I have Kivan in my party and didn't know until very recently that he is on a timer. I've cleared the bandit camp but obviously haven't killed Tazok yet. Will Kivan be satisfied to stay with me now or is his sidequest still incomplete until I killTazok?  Thanks!
baldursgate,3e09od,tobiasgetsfunke,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think you need to talk to the scalp lady (the one in the Jovial juggler). Talk to her twice actually, the first time to sell all your scalps and the second time for the game to register that you're talking to her without any scalps, and the bandits are cleared. She'll then leave the inn and the chapter ends (and Kivan will stay with you).  I don't think you have to kill Tazok to win the chapter."
baldursgate,3e09od,luke_luke_luke,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:15 2015 UTC,Hmm. I believe Chapter 3 ended with me looting the chest in Tazok's tent in the Bandit Camp.  I'll try and talk to her though and see what comes up.
baldursgate,3e09od,tobiasgetsfunke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"It probably did end there, my terminology is poor. This is a common problem/question that apparently pops up all the time. The standard response that works is for people to activate the quest trigger of Officer Via (scalp lady) to leave the inn and proclaim the bandit menace dealt with.  Also, Kivan is awesome!"
baldursgate,3e09od,luke_luke_luke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write. I guess I should do everything before I go to baldur's gate because as you say, when you're there you don't want to go back in to the forests and mountains of the south."
baldursgate,3e09od,luke_luke_luke,3,Tue Jul 21 08:34:29 2015 UTC,Yes. Once you get into Baldur's gate you don't even want to do all the stuff there before you get bored and decide to continue the main quest. I had to ask a question last week about cool stuff to do in that town because I've never had the stamina to talk to everyone.
baldursgate,3dydbj,3932695,7,Mon Jul 20 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"You keep your health, but your THACO, bonuses from kensai, extra attacks per round, and weapon mastery will all be lost during the time you are leveling up your second class.  It's frustrating, but it's also how you get the most powerful characters in the game."
baldursgate,3dydbj,Fusrodahmus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"Hmmm just health? If I dual class at level 9, how long do I have to put up with the downtime? Level 1 to 2 already seems pretty slow."
baldursgate,3dydbj,PandaBouse,4,Mon Jul 20 15:41:24 2015 UTC,You need to be 1 level above original class to regain all bonuses.
baldursgate,3dydbj,PandaBouse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"I meant, in hours or percentage of play-through. If it's a very long time, I may be better off switching to something like half-orc fighter/cleric or elven archer since I don't think I know the game well enough to handle the downtime."
baldursgate,3dydbj,PandaBouse,4,Mon Jul 20 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell. Best way is to look at xp tables, and see how much new class needs. Mages need most exp, while cleric or thief are easy to level up.  But I really don't recommend dual classing in BG1, it's best done in BG2. Mainly because level are highers, and you will quickly regain old class."
baldursgate,3dydbj,lcfparty15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:52 2015 UTC,Ah I feared this was the case.  Do I even reach level 9 in BG1? Could I hold back my leveling to dual class in BG2 at the right time?
baldursgate,3dydbj,TheNalgenie,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"XP cap in BG1 is 161k so it's around level 9 for most classes. So it's better to wait until BG2.  Usually it's best to wait until level 9 or 13 to dual class, because you get max hp at level 9 and at level 13 you get extra attack as warrior."
baldursgate,3dydbj,DylanMcDermott,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Fighters need 250k exp to reach level 9 so I don't have to worry about dual classing in BG1."
baldursgate,3dyte4,haerdalisdo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think you can turn this on. Maybe try options -> feedback (the button above auto-pause) -> then press to hit rolls. I haven't tested this, but I remember seeing Neera's wild surge results in lots of detail before.  edit; also doesn't the game by default tell you that she is casting a spell at 4 levels below her caster level (or whatever) immediately after starting to cast it? It does in my game. If you're not seeing that then try selecting other things in the feedback menu as well.  Also, having the to hit rolls shown as feedback is fun if your just stuffing around and experimenting with wild surges, but it clogs up your in game feedback screen with an insane amount of uninteresting information.  edit: grammar"
baldursgate,3dyte4,luke_luke_luke,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Nope, all feedback options are on.  I can see what result I get, but not the roll that got me there."

This might EASILY result in undefined behavior however.  You can also use it to manually add special abilities to the character, to emulate the class combo you desire."
baldursgate,3dweyc,dopplegangerexpress,4,Mon Jul 20 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"Use the sleep spell? You don't need to target an enemy with it, so your mage can cast it without actually seeing an enemy, just the spot she's casting it at.  edit: Also, the game gives you clear foreknowledge of this encounter when you're given the quest in gullykin village. Also, you've likely fought kobolds already in the main quest, so it is more than appropriate for your party to plan your spells to counter the kobolds. You experienced traps kobolds set earlier in the main quest as well, so you should be looking for them. It should not be appropriate for you to plan against any other specific encounters, but mages should always have some generalist spells at their disposal."
baldursgate,3dweyc,luke_luke_luke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:31:46 2015 UTC,Is sleep an area effect?  I used the cloudkill spell once not realizing that it just knocks enemies out. I thought we would have easy kills until it knocked use out too!

Cloudkill is actually a good idea (if you can find it, I think it's a 5th level wizard spell). It actually kills all in the spot, and any who wander in. The one which knocks them down is stinking cloud."
baldursgate,3dweyc,yellow_hat_elminster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"Sleep doesn't have a limit on the number of creatures it will affect (well I suppose its limit is the number of creatures in its radius but on a practical level there is no limit to the number of enemies it will affect). Its only limit is on the level of the creatures it will affect. Its different in IWD but in BG it only works on creatures at level 4 or less HD (the spell description is also wrong). A rough listing of the enemies it works on is black talon elites, bandits, ankhegs, giant spiders, huge spiders, gibberlings, xvarts, wolves, dire wolves, black bears, gnolls, gnoll elite, gnoll veterans, flinds, hobgoblins, hobgoblin elites, chill hobgoblins, half-ogres, ogres, ogre berserkers, ogrillions, tasloi, kobolds, and kobold commandos."

If you lead with the fighter you end up face first in traps, and if you lead with the thief you end up face first in Kobolds.

baldursgate,3dweyc,FrisianDude,2,Mon Jul 20 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"If you have a secondary (non-thief) character who can hide in shadows, use a two-man team, as I did (I had a monk). Have them advance with the secondary character slightly in front and the thief detecting traps. It has to be done slowly to work properly, but I found it quite useful (as you'd have to go slowly to detect traps anyways).  The secondary hidden-in-shadows character will detect any kobolds, while the thief will find any traps. Together, these two will detect the surprises of Firewine so that you can plan ahead with your whole party."
baldursgate,3dweyc,ReversalofGraves,2,Mon Jul 20 11:31:45 2015 UTC,Sounds like you did fine. I can't say I recall that many kobols though
baldursgate,3dweyc,pipkin42,2,Mon Jul 20 12:44:27 2015 UTC,God I remembered the days when I reloaded like 50 times just for Edwin successfully channeling a fireball without burning my frontline to death.

baldursgate,3dw4p0,lcfparty15,6,Mon Jul 20 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love the 3 person party, even with a majority dual/multiclassed.  Your three choices there seem to complement really well, R/C tanks better than any class (you did set the R/C back to full druid spells right? Otherwise, the dwarf Fighter/Cleric is a better pick, in my opinion).  F/M complements the R/C well, while offering extra crowd control options.  Illusionist/Thief is stellar, especially if you don't want to dual class.  I'm partial to the Swashbuckler (15) -> Mage (28), but that's a dual.  I don't imagine you will run into much trouble; this is truly an OP party.  As for the Dragon Sorcerer, it isn't a waste of experience, but you won't be wanting for the extra firepower in all but the most difficult battles.  F/M/T seems like it would limit your potential here, keeping in mind you are looking for an overpowered party.  You miss out on all of those important 9th level mage spells, not to mention having the luxury of that extra caster. I think the F/M/T is best suited to soloing."
baldursgate,3dw4p0,TheNalgenie,5,Mon Jul 20 01:49:00 2015 UTC,How would I go about setting back to full druid spells?
baldursgate,3dw4p0,RenjiAsou,6,Mon Jul 20 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Search up the Baldur.ini file, it should be easy enough to find.  I have a native app so that I can play on my Mac, it's in the package contents.  In there, you can find a line toward the bottom under game options that looks like:   'Game Options',    'Cleric Ranger Spells',   '1'  Just change that '1' to a '0' and you have just undone the restriction.  This is only relevant to the BG2EE, I don't think this works or even matters in the first game."
baldursgate,3dw4p0,TheNalgenie,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:37 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! Gonna go do my enhanced R/C playthrough now. Happy times are coming!
baldursgate,3dw4p0,RenjiAsou,3,Mon Jul 20 11:25:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man.  How do I set the R/C back?   I might take the DD just for shits and giggles, then, because I love sorcerers and I'll turn up the difficulty as it gets boring, but I want someone to stand back and blast. I suppose the gnome could handle it, though. We'll see..I'll ditch the DD and distribute her xp in keeper if she doesn't pull her weight/slows me down."
baldursgate,3dw4p0,TheNalgenie,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:52 2015 UTC,See my response to /u/RenjiAsou right above.  It should be easy to do.
baldursgate,3dw4p0,Myrag,5,Mon Jul 20 02:27:17 2015 UTC,"Uh oh,  My type of question!  General   So you said about OP, by OP I understand overpowered. As a player who played a lot of Nightmare Mode (I explain this later in the topic) I must say there is a lot of types of overpowered combos in the game. Usually it tends to lean towards where you want to end up.   Of course always the most OP party will be of 6 members just because you can still hit XP cap in both BG1 and BG2 before last chapters. Leaning towards smaller party has interesting power-curve because it is weaker very early on but once you get those levels rolling you destroy everything and then slow down once xp capped. At this point party of 6 will get ahead slowly until completely overtaking. Note that I do love smaller parties too but not in nightmare.   Party size  As previously stated this is decision based on where you want to end up with your party and what difficulty you want to play on and which mods you want to install. If you don't play difficulty increasing mods especially ones that increase HP then 3/4 man parties are very enjoyable and easy to run with.   Problem with small parties for me is that I love trying out builds and classes and get that cool feeling of getting upgrade and feeling more powerful which with bigger party I can get more :) so yes please. Note that I played 4 man parties in BG series for year now but I recently switched to 5 and 6man ones. Especially after beamdog added 1.3 fix to how party follows you so often you don't get weird pathing issues when your party gets stuck in corridors.   Arcane multiclassers/duals  If you play normal game on Insane difficulty which if you already did in the past is pretty easy for BG powergamer then F/M combos are really good because they have a lot of powerful spells that last for only few rounds which is enough in many cases. Any kind of combo with mage is very strong because of how brokenly powerful improved haste is. That is also the reason many consider Kensai/Mage dual to be the strongest character in unmodded game.   Ranged Kensai?!?  I know, sounds weird but I just recently discovered this is one of highest damage outputting characters in the game. You equip that boy with a boomerang dagger +2 and later with fire tooth +3 (both bg2) and because daggers get strength bonus to their damage grab grandmastery and get 4 base APR and 8 under improved haste. Endgame my kensai was throwing each dagger for 40/50 damage and 80/100 crits. With critical strike HLA he did 8x80/100 crits in round so 640/800 damage in 10 seconds which is very admirable - especially for ranged character - note that Nightmare mode SCS dragons have over 1000HP so it is necessary. Archer doesn't come close unless he pops Vhailor's Helm with simulacra but that is only for limited duration.   Archer   I always admired Archer because it clearly most damaging and consistent character. In BG1 archer and Kensai in daggers are top tier damage dealers, often NPCs cant even reach only.  In BG2 you get tuigan bow very early and get 5APR really early, when under improved haste you get 10APR with either called shot or ciritcal strike HLA later on you are monster in the damage.   Cool thing is that archer can get Vhailor's Helm which will create his own low level copy but that copy still can get called shot. Called shot drains -2STR when you get it high enough meaning 2 archers (one base and one simulacra) under 10APR can drain enemy strength from even 25 to 0 in single round. Do you know what this means? Of couse in BG ruleset if your stat is drained to 0 you die, doesn't matter if you are dragon or mage or whatever, if you drop to 0 stat you die. Very powerful combo.   Archer also gets later on gesen bow which even though lowers your APR to 4 (8-IH) but does elemental damage which goes through stoneskin so it is superb! for interrupting mages. Archer is simply one of the strongest single-classed characters in the game. One thing to consider is that I LOVE to use my aracane casters to cause mass confusions in enemy lines with CC like skills at which point they start running like stupid all over the place, often melee will have trouble chasing them and hitting where archer will just nuke the crap out of them.   Inquisitor   This is probably most OP single-classer in the game especially in unmodded game. His dispel magic and true sight are so game breaking making all fights with mages a piece of cake. There is interesting things about this char which most people don't realise. Usually dispel magic is level 3 spell which means globe of invulnerability can protect you against it. Inquisitor dispel magic is level 0 which means it's special so his dispel will dispel almost anything in the game. Lich just poped all buffs, mantle, protection from magic weapons etc? dispel magic and his your punching bag. His dispel is twice his level making it even more OP than it is. Seriously once you have this guy no mage stands on battlefield for very long. True sight also is very great anti-mage killer and those nasty rogues.    One drawback is that you need to get used to aiming dispel because it will strip you of your buffs as well but who needs buffs against lich is he will die in 1 rounds when you dispel him. This guy is a beast once you equip him with carsomyr in BG2.   Skald  This is one of those 'agree to disagree' options but once I started using it on nightmare mode I feel like I will never run without one ever again. This character made impossible fights into possible which is crazy. There is many cool things about skald, for instance at lvl 15 his song gives +4 dmg +4 to hit -4 to AC which is CRAZY buff. If you think about it math pretty much says +4 dmg (this is simple) +4 hit means +20% chance to hit CRAZY! and -4AC enemy has -20% chance to hit your entire party, CRAZY! I know right! And this is not all, at level 16 you get mislead spell which can also sing song and double this buff to +8dmg +8hit -8AC... I mean WUUUT! If this isn't broken enough consider this. With 3mil xp mark he gets UAI HLA so he can use Vhailor helm which can also sing song! so +12 +12 -12. If this isn't yet godlike for you? simulacra can also cast mislead and get 4th bard to sing. +16 +16 -16... I mean oh boy... this is already cheeese level. I never even use this even in nightmare it is just tooooo good.   Skald allows your tank hit 24AC armor class cap as well as he himself has that pretty easily. So you can two tanks which for 99% enemies in the game have only 5% chance to be hitted (can't get to 0%) so you then give stoneskin to you skald and if your seconds tank is FM or Ranger/Cleric then they also have stoneskin so basically your tanks are pretty much immortal regardless of difficulty.   Ranger/Cleric  Probably my favourite tank, I like having cleric in the party for buffs and summons and sometimes restorations. This guy gets druid spells so he gets ironskins which is stoneskin equivalent basically a beast. I usually give him shield and proficiencies in sword and shield fighting (name is misleading but it works with any weapon and shield). Skeletons summons after lvl 15 are super powerful because of good defense and 90% magic resist.  Sorcerer or Wild Mage  From arcane casters I always loved the two and I always bring one in the party. If you can't decide like myself between those two you can always create Sorcerer and add Wild Mage kit via EE Keeper.   Thing about arcane caster is that their power-curve is really slow at start but once they start getting spells above 7 it starts getting crazy. A sorcerer on high level can cast combo like: project image -> time stop -> improved alacrity -> summon planetar -> 5x mordenkainens sword -> zyllion of other spells that are casting speed under 5 -> improved haste on entire party -> spell immunity divination (so true sight won't kill image) -> and then whatever floats your boat, maybe IH swords, maybe casts 5 dragon breaths? -> time stop ends and suddenly you entered fight with 5 morde swords planetar party buffed, enemies debuffed and hundreds of damage dealt in what in game was probably 1 round for enemies. What is most crazy here? you mage actually used only one cast of project image because you dished out all this from your project image clone so you can cast this like 7/8 per day before needing any rest. Crazy!   With wild magic you can add like 8 NRD -> dragon breath in that time stop which means total of 14 dragon breaths each for 50+ dmg on all enemies. 700+ aoe damage anyone? If you get sometimes wild surge you get double casts etc. Best I got was refreshed my spell while in time stop from wild surge so I did cast like 20+ dragon breaths and basically wiped enemies in late TOB with it.  Mage late game is probably strongest character but blooms very late. This is also why many people choose this character as solo playthrough since in solo you get high levels early since no XP sharing.  If you feel like cheating this could be considered but with D&D 4E ruleset there is thing called Chaos Sorcerer which basically is Sorcerer with wild magic so you only adding something that could potentially be in the game. ps. I tested this it works with randomizing levels, NRD and wild surges."
baldursgate,3dw4p0,Myrag,3,Mon Jul 20 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thiefs  Because I always play on insane or higher I can't be arsed with traps so I need to have some sort of thief in the party. I did many iterations where I finally settled on F/M/T multiclass. Why? I can pimp him in throwing daggers just like Kensai. I usually get him as my CHARNAME so that he gets free DUHM innate so extra str for that dagger damage. Later in the game especially in nightmare I love giving him shield with blackrazor with shield and get 3rd really strong tank. Haste and level drains are really good boosts to overall party performance. FMT also gets UAI so you can boost his AC really low or get him nice dps gear if needed.  I used mine with many different build. 1) using firetooth +4 crossbow and switching to carsomyr when I did run without inquisitor.   SCS  Is is very interesting mod to have, adds great AI to enemies and increases difficulty of some fights. I highly recommend it. Otherwise game is simply too easy to say any party is OP since you can complete game easily with pretty much any party if you know what are you doing.  Nightmare Mode  In enhanced editions there was added new mode in baldur.ini file. Once you select this all mobs in the game will get extra XP based on following rule 3*base HP+80 which means 20HP goblin will have 140HP. Dragons instead of having 150+ will have 550+ and some will be comming close to 1000. If you add SCS on this it will go even higher. Very nice, changes the way you play the game completely. I just finished my second run on this mode so it's definately doable.   Party comps  Best 4 man party option 1 (nightmare and SCS mode ready)   F/M/T - charname into throwing daggers/crossbows/sword and shield (depends on your preference - all work good) - interesting spin here is to give him two handed spec and run carsomyr when he gets UAI since you don't have inquisitor with you R/C - main tank Archer (or kensai in daggers) - main dps Skald - song buff bott   Best 4 man party option 1 (SCS ready)   F/M/T - charname into throwing daggers/crossbows/sword and shield (depends on your preference - all work good) R/C - main tank Archer (or kensai in daggers) - main dps Inquisitor - if you are not running nightmare mode you can drop skald and grab inquisitor for easy mage fights. I don't run him on nightmare mode because you can't have melee without stoneskins on that mode or they are instantly dead.   Best 5 man party   F/M/T  R/C - main tank Archer (or kensai in daggers) - main dps Skald - song buff bott Inquisitor or Sorcerer or Kensai/Archer as seconds ranged   Best 6 man party   F/M/T  R/C - main tank Archer (or kensai in daggers) - main dps Skald - song buff bott  Inquisitor - swap for more durable char in nightmare mode like F/M or ranged archer or kensai Sorcerer"
baldursgate,3dw4p0,Myrag,2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I'm already seeing some of your wisdom playing out. I'll stick with the goofy party I made for now (I went F/M, R/C, T/Illusionist, and Dragon Disciple, like I said in the OP).   Having played through once when I was a kid (not all the way and I had to cheat...the game was too hard for me back then), and a couple times now in my early 30s, I've learned that Archer is probably the fiercest class. With a good archer in my first full playthrough, that sob did so much of the killing that my other guys could basically smoke cigs and shoot dice during most fights.  Had I stuck an archer in instead of the DD, for example, I think my party would have started out better. Damn these dudes are squishy atm.   Also, despite my deep love for the game (the series is my favorite by a fairly wide margin), I'm clearly not as good at the game as a lot of you guys, because on just the middle setting I'm struggling so far.  But, that's another reason I wanted to play a small, powerful party: to get better at the game. Because it's not like other games. While this party will get OP, right now I'm having trouble where a party with like an archer and a couple of beefy tanks would be wrecking shit.  But I love how much magic I have in this party. Magic is my favorite part of this, my favorite game. It's just so cool. No other game's magic system pulls me in so much. I lack the words to explain it...in other RPGS, often a mage is just another form of damage-dealer, with high dps but very squishy. While that holds here, you get the sense that a wizard in the BG games can really do what a wizard should be able to do: crazy shit you don't expect. Maybe it's not, but the magic system in this game, compared to others, has an ""outside the box"" feeling to me. Like anything could happen."
baldursgate,3dw4p0,TheNalgenie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Just keep on it and don't give up.  I look at your party and it is very good party so don't worry, I'm pretty much powergamer so I squeeze every bit of every char but I've ran setups like yours too.  I love BG because it is game of knowledge by huge margin. If you strugle it's not because you are bad it is 90% of time because you don't know things that could help you through.   For instance I started of as a kid as well, BG was my first boxed title I bought with my own money... hell I also cheated at first but this game is sooo unforgiving even with cheats it is not easy. I think when played right difficulty slider doesn't really matter.   There is so much to learn like    golems need blunt weapons, skeletons and ghostly knights too otherwise you will have very hard times.  attacks per round is most important stat in the game for non caster character in terms of damage usually its better to have 1 super beefy tank instead of 3 with decent AC  summons are very nice to keep hard enemies off you haste and improved haste are priceless spells there is couple nice combos in BG1 like using cleric to cast free action and make your mage cast couple webs on enemies while your melee freeroam and destroy them. Note that spider spawn (mage spell) can also walk in web. also for class like sorc avoid spells like sleep which does not scale as it is based on monster HD which in Bg2 will be useless spell. Spook in nice on the other end."

I won't give up, but I might run out of time. Wife wants me to start on another novel (haven't published one yet, to be clear, but I did go through an MFA and I'm pretty good at it. My profs said I would publish one eventually).   I'm all about spook for sorc. Good tip on the sleep thing, though. I'll pay attention to that.  I've never fully utilized my cleric so I went r/c so I could really learn the priest spells.  I've started BG2 with a f/m but never started from the beginning with one. That guy ain't pulling his weight so far, but I know how good they get.   Man, I have so much shit to do but I really just want to play this game. What a black hole..."
baldursgate,3dw4p0,senordingdong01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"I just want to throw in that for non-sorcerers, sleep is about the best first level spell in BG1. Sleep and Command (Priest) are excellent crowd control spells, even working on some reasonably powerful creatures such as Ankhegs. I'm not sure which game you're starting on, but don't overlook sleep for the first one."

BG1ee feels so much more expansive than BG2ee, so many huge areas to explore (largely with little in though)."
baldursgate,3dqgna,theskymoves,10,Sat Jul 18 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but BG2:EE feels a lot more full. BG1 has a lot of space that is pretty much empty. While in BG2 almost every place you go has something either big or interesting going on.  Either way both are fantastic experiences. BG1 is more relaxed exploration while BG2 is more ""significant"" (best word I could find).  But BG1 balances the relaxedness with starting you off pretty squishy so exploring can still be tense with bears in the beginning, and tougher bounty hunters later on. Combine that with how by the end of the game you feel so powerful compared to your initial self that you really feel progression and empowerment.   ...Wow. Um this got away from me. Um yeah."

While in BG2 almost every place you go has something either big or interesting going on.   I feel that BG1 draws its strength from having an open world to explore. Yes, some areas won't be interesting...you know, just like in the real world. But in almost all of those areas there is something to do, places to explore, gibberlings to kill.  BG2 puts you on rails and you're kind of just sitting there."

I've never played BGI or BGII without Jaheria though, so I'm probably biased with how much I love her character.  Xan and Coran are constantly at each other for being polar opposites.

baldursgate,3dntnb,orcusmalorcus,7,Fri Jul 17 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"In general, half-elf is the WORST choice for multi-classing, since they have very few bonuses compared to the other races.  Gnome cleric/illusionist is strong, but you miss out on horrid wilting and skull trap(and the other, less useful necromancies).  When playing a cleric/mage, you have to think about the opportunity cost for your actions.  What I mean is, you're trying to be two spellcasters in one, which means every round, you have to choose between casting a mage spell or a cleric spell.  That means, obviously, that you cannot cast the other option in the same amount of time.  The class is strong, but I think a party is better served by a multiclass mage/thief, or a fighter/cleric, or a fighter/mage.  All three are, in my opinion, better choices for multiclass.  Ultimately, though, it's your decision.  I'm sure a cleric mage is extremely fun and ultra-powerful in the late game, once you have improved alacrity."
baldursgate,3dntnb,Fusrodahmus,6,Fri Jul 17 21:37:50 2015 UTC,Notably spell sequencers can sequence up spells from both books. So you can on occasion cast cleric and mage spells at the same time.
baldursgate,3dntnb,gangler52,6,Sat Jul 18 06:55:22 2015 UTC,"I played a Cleric/Mage when ToB first came out, so little 13 year-old goldgecko might not have been the most skilled player, but I remember C/Ms being very fun and versatile, but incredibly fragile.  I suppose it'd be worth a second look now, especially since my play style has evolved from ""FIREBALL EVERYTHING""."
baldursgate,3dntnb,goldgecko4,14,Fri Jul 17 22:27:58 2015 UTC,First played this game a decade ago. FIREBALL EVERYTHING has remained a rewarding strategy.
baldursgate,3dntnb,DirtyPatronus,7,Fri Jul 17 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"I like Cleric/Mages. I usually like two mages (one pure and one multi) in my party, and you can get away as a multi-class cleric as your primary healer (anyone who uses Jahiera or Yeslick primarily pretty much does this already), so you can add just one pure mage and both of those boxes are checked (4 slots remaining). It's not true that you can't wear armor; early on, you can pretty much ignore the mage side if you so choose by wearing armor and just fight like a cleric. Weapons are restricted to cleric weapons, but those are quite good in both games (you can go FotA+3/+5 in BG2/ToB). You'll be quite squishy (unless you wear armor) but that's fine as long as you pick up some tank types early on.  Gnomish cleric-illusionists can get very, very powerful. It's the only mage kit you can legally multi-class, so it gives you a bonus spell, which is huge, especially considering you get the Ring of Wizardry (not sure what it's called in EE) right away. My friend doesn't like the look of gnomes in the game, so he used eekeeper to make his character look like an elf instead.  In BG2, Aerie (despite being a sadsack) was always one of my favorite NPC's because she was so dynamic. She never had the best high-level mage spells, but she's good enough to be the primary cleric if you so choose, and she's a great support mage. Your PC would pretty much be a stronger Aerie if you go gnomish cleric-illusionist.   Managing two spellbooks isn't too bad, particularly if you have another mage to split the burden. I've done a primarily buffing mage and a primarily damage-dealing mage. Obviously certain missions require shuffling the spellbook, but it's not too awful. It's the same as if you had two separate characters doing the mage and cleric duties."
baldursgate,3dntnb,mtrem225,3,Fri Jul 17 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, the top comment in that thread was mine!  Chiming in here again. All my previous advice stands.  Some field testing has revealed that Gnome is a lot better of a choice than I initially thought. Their magic resistance and other passive racial abilities are pretty okay if you can handle the wisdom hit. Even better, if you're going BG1 -> BGII, there are actually 3 tomes of wisdom in BG1, more than enough to compensate for it.  Keep in mind that while you 'can't wear armor', elven chain is a-okay for you. Speccing into Sling and either Mace/Flail/Hammer is great for the very tasty fact that you can use a shield. Defensive Buff magic + Elven Chain + a Shield can make this character one of the better tanks in the game, for a little while"
baldursgate,3dntnb,wackodraco,3,Fri Jul 17 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"Short answer: High versatility, low power (at least relative to single class casters). They make great support casters but they level so slowly that you're best off loading them up with spells that aren't level dependent"
baldursgate,3dntnb,MilesBeyond250,3,Sat Jul 18 03:55:48 2015 UTC,"More in-depth answer:  First, managing two spellbooks isn't too bad, unless you like to cast without pausing, but why would you do that to yourself?  As for race, the general rule of BG is: The further you go down the list, the more powerful the race is, but the less class options they have. Therefore you should choose the lowest-down race that can fit your build. In other words, only go Human if you want Paladin, Monk, or dual-class; only go Half-Elf if you want triple-class, etc etc. Gnomes are going to be much, much better than Half-Elves in general. Why? Shorty Saving Throws. If your Gnome has got 18 CON, then they'll have an absolutely godlike bonus to resisting basically anything that's not physical damage. Cackle maniacally as your character regularly shrugs off Power Words, Dominate, and all sorts of other annoying spells. This is especially nice in BG1 where at low levels Shamans and Mages casting Horror can completely devastate you.  However, here it's actually a tougher choice. Gnomes can only be Illusionists, so you get Cleric/Illusionist rather than Cleric/Mage. On the one hand, that's an extra Mage spell per level, which is really nice, especially considering how few spell slots you'll have due to multiclassing. However, it does mean giving up Necromancy spells, which is a bit of a shame. This actually isn't as big of a deal as it could be, since the best Necromancy spells are probably Animate Dead and Skull Trap - the former you also get as a Cleric spell, and the latter you won't have the levels to cheese anyway. However, you do also miss out on things like Horror, Vampiric Touch, and one of my favourite spells, Abi-Dalzam's Horrid Wilting.  Second, Gnomes get a -1 WIS penalty, and unlike INT which is pretty much useless, Wisdom is actually incredibly important, as it confers massive bonus spells slots. Considering how with all the permanent bonuses as well as the Silver Ioun Stone, it's possible to hit 25 WIS... that's a lot of spells. Being a Gnome means that your starting WIS will be 17 (because you absolutely want to max out WIS. Just trust me on this one), making your max 24. Before beefing up your stats, that means you'll miss out on a bonus level 4 spell slot; after, it means missing a spell slot for levels 6 and 7.  In my opinion, the extra Mage spells from being an Illusionist or the Shorty Saving Throws are each alone enough to outweigh the disadvantages; together it's not even a contest. Still, something worth taking into consideration.  As for survival strategies... Starting out you'll have three Cleric slots and two Mage slots. For Cleric slots, I find that Cure Light Wounds, Remove Fear, and Sanctuary are all going to be great for survivability. Remove Fear in particular is nice in the beginning as Horror can ruin your day and party members tend to flee easily. Bless is also a decent choice as it really helps your party get over their horrendous THAC0. For Mage spells? I'd recommend Armor and Sleep. Sleep is the ultimate spell in early BG1. You can safely and quickly eradicate massive groups with it. Armor lasts for eight hours and provides the same AC as Splint Mail while still allowing you to cast spells.  As far as gear, possibly the Cleric/Mage's greatest weakness is its small weapon selection. However, there's still some pretty awesome stuff you can get happening.  In BG1, aim for Ashideena, the Warhammer +2, for melee, and slings for ranged (+1 Slings are cheap and plentiful, and there's a fairly powerful sling in Durlag's Tower). In your other hand, use whatever shield your strength allows. Dual-wielding is really not going to be beneficial for you. For Helmet, just use whatever until you can pick up the Helm of Balduran. Rings, you're gonna want to get the Ring of Wizardry and the Ring of Holiness, both of which are available very early. For hands... that's gonna depend on your statline. Bracers of AC can be helpful, but you might prefer the Gauntlets of Dexterity or Ogre Strength if you don't have anyone else who needs them more. Girdles and Boots are going to be up to you. For armour, just grab whichever Archmage robe suits your alignment. Oh, and the Amulet of Metaspell Influence.  BG2 I'd say get the Robe of Vecna, the Amulet of Power, Crom Faeyr, a Sling (Sling of Seeking if you have a high STR without Crom, otherwise Arvoreen's). Rings have a lot of good options. I'd say Ring of Gaxx and Ring of Wizardry, but there's some other good ones too. Cloak of Protection and Cloak of Mirroring are good choices for your shoulder slot. Hands slot you should probably put something that boosts your THAC0, though AC might be nice, too. For your waist, Girdles of Strength if you want to exploit the Sling of Seeking, but otherwise grab whatever you want. Same with Boots. BG2 has all sorts of fun shields. Dragon Scale Shield is maybe the best for most of the game, but Shield of Harmony, Shield of Reflection, and even Shield of the Lost are also pretty good choices. For head, Silver Ioun Stone is the best choice but until then the Helm of Balduran can get you through.  EDIT: Also forgot to mention that if you're a gnome then in BG2 you won't be able to romance anyone except Aerie, if that sort of thing matters to you."
baldursgate,3dntnb,MilesBeyond250,3,Sat Jul 18 13:16:02 2015 UTC,"You can put cleric spells in sequencers and contingencies, which is fun in bg2, instant triple flame strike or triple holy smite, this includes cleric HLAs so you can have an instant triple implosion. You can use armour if you want, but it disables Mage spells, useful early in bg1 where you don't have many good spells anyway, eventually you will switch over to robes and spell based protection, the usual mirror image stoneskin etc. Other fun stuff is that cast time reductions work on your cleric spells, so with robe of vecna and amulet of power healing spells are fairly easy to use mid combat, you also get to use all your cleric spells during timestop when you get it. Slings and flails are both decent choices for weapons. You will want high will for cleric spells so your wish/limited wish should be pretty good too. Only issue with the cleric illusionist gnome is that skull trap and horrid wilting are probably the best offensive spells in the game."
baldursgate,3dntnb,Electric999999,2,Sat Jul 18 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"I've played a cleric/mage through all of BG1 and a chunk of BG2.  My opinion. Cleric/mages are cool. They're powerful. Got like all the spells.  Problem is, at least when I'm playing I find I wanna take advantage of the spell versatility. Memorize a bunch of different spells instead of the same spell several times.  Which is great and gratifying during the early levels, but as you progress it starts to get a little ridiculous. Because you've got like so many spells. Gotta scroll past a stupid number of spells anytime you wanna do anything.  Which is usually where the game ends for me. Playing through and finally get to the point where it's like ""Jesus Christ, this isn't fun anymore.  Probably if you were so inclined you could purposefully streamline your mage/cleric. Memorize haste three times instead of haste, slow, and dire charm. That sort of thing.   I played a gnome last time. Power wise I think a gnome illusionist/cleric works really well, because the cleric spells cover a fair chunk of the lost necromancy spells anyway. You don't really lose much and you gain more spells per day plus shorty saves. That being said today I think I'd be more inclined to do a half-elf just because of the additional versatility.   In terms of survival strategies, Blind, Sleep, and Command are really enough to get through most of BG1. Just incapacitates opponents so that your party can slay them unimpeded. My cleric/mage trended towards that role in general with a lot of debilitating spells from both spellbooks."

What is the best way to allocate the profience points? Is it best to max out one weapon first and then take dual wielding or is it better to take like 3 in flails and then dual?
baldursgate,3dlxqn,rashandal,4,Fri Jul 17 10:29:30 2015 UTC,you can only spend 2 proficience points as a multiclass fighter/ranger (and 3 in dual wield). and as a ranger you get 2 points in dual wield for free.  so with 2 in flails and 3 in dual wield youre already maxed out. i guess youll have plenty of proficiency points left over to level some of the other weapons aswell.

You would then have: - the berserker rage, which is extremely powerful with the immunity to confusion, domination, level drain, etc. - the bonus of playing a warrior (grandmastery, 1 more attack per round at lvl 13)  The downside being, compared to a dwarf warrior/cleric: - no ranged weapon - when changing class, there will be a period in SoA where your character will be significantly weaker."

I moved SCS to second to last at the recommendation of the readme documentation.  My install order: 1. Unfinished business 2. BG 1 NPC project  (followed by music) 3. BG 1 romantic encounters 4. Sword coast stratagems 5. BG2 Tweak Pack   Everything seems to be running smoothly now. The only problem I've seen is with the numbers displayed on my ""stack"" of silver rings. I enabled this mod from the tweak pack. There is only 1 ring in my ""stack"", but there are two numbers displayed in both the bottom left and right corners of the item icon in my inventory. Definitely not a big deal atm and it may resolve itself once i truly stack the items."
baldursgate,3dkigq,ronindog,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:51 2015 UTC,Saving this. I'll probably attempt tomorrow

I wanted to enhance the golem building quest inside the Planar Sphere so that the golem could become a companion. I had a small, freeform quest where the party could find and install different 'parts' to enhance the golem, similar to the Dak'kon dialogs in Planescape. I thought it would be a cool roleplaying option for wizard types.   Later games (NWN, Dragon Age) came with cool golem companions that sort of scratched the itch, I guess. I'm also pleasantly surprised that Pillars of Eternity is adding a construct companion in their upcoming expansion as well."

I think this would be so cool because, if you were a real hoopy Bhaalspawn who really knew where your towel was, why couldn't you do this? I think it would also be cool to make Gorion recruitable very late on (TOB maybe) and add a lot of potential storylines."

baldursgate,3dc51e,DirtyPatronus,2,Wed Jul 15 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Yeslick. I like him as a character. He's the only good dwarf that ever joins you, and his story is one about honor and dying traditions and survivor guilt but it's not really a big deal because it's Baldur's Gate 1. I think he must be underused in the majority of playthroughs because he's in the middle of a plot dungeon halfway through the game and by then you have all your shit together. I planned ahead to make him my 6th party member, and found him a pretty rewarding character, kind of like Jaheira with better spells and no Khalid. Cleric buffs and Gauntlets of Ogre Power turned him into a beast in combat. I recommend going out of your way to get a character that probably doesn't see the most play out of the cast."

baldursgate,3dc51e,orcusmalorcus,2,Wed Jul 15 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"The dungeon where you meet him is part of the main plot and your goal is to destroy it. If you're RPing Good and going in with a full party, you'd have to save him, backtrack out, reform the party down to 5 somewhere outside the dungeon, and then go back in and ask him to join you. Any characters left in the dungeon when it is destroyed are lost forever. Yeslick doesn't save himself if you don't let him join you, which I always thought was part of his tragedy. You basically have to prepare to get Yeslick in your party, which is why I think he probably doesn't see a whole lot of play, but I think it's totally worth it."
baldursgate,3dc51e,DWSeven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:33:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that is more involved than I anticipated. Butttt the consensus sounds like he is a good pick so I'll try and work him into the party.

baldursgate,3dc51e,errboi,2,Wed Jul 15 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"It can still be fine even if you forget to prepare. He won't initate dialog on his own when you find him, so you can clear all the way up to him, then backtrack outside to drop someone from your group, go back in, and pick him up.

If you want a strong contributor to the party consider Kivan. He can wield 2-handed weapons decently and does massive damage with his bow. He can't tank that well though."

Half of them are published in English. The last two Ciri books are being published the next two years, and The Sword of Destiny, the second of the two short story collections, which I haven't read yet, was published a couple months ago. Okay, so more than half. All but two. But yes, fan translations are available online.  and one of the best parts is that you then get to play the incredibly amazing and well done and respectful games they've made and continue the story.  The Witcher sets the standard for telling a story across published books and video games. Especially since the books came first and the video games only seek to complement them, instead of retelling them. Plus both work incredibly well on their own, but having read the books makes the experience of the games that much better. I'm rambling. I really like The Witcher, uh, franchise.

baldursgate,3dbou5,DirtyPatronus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:11 2015 UTC,"I have this series in my basement, but could never get around to it. How highly would you recommend it?"
baldursgate,3dbou5,brauchen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"I read it when I was a teenager, and it was the best thing in the world for me back then. It takes all the stock tropes and characters of fantasy and deliberately puts them into stock situations, but in a way that makes it exciting all over again. (David Eddings wrote the series after taking a course on literary criticism, and wanted to see if he could make something genuinely new and great out of classic and overly familiar scenarios. He called it ""the literary equivalent of peddling dope"". And it's fantastic.) I haven't read the books for a long time now, so I couldn't tell you if they're just as exciting for adults, but I remember them incredibly fondly."
baldursgate,3dbou5,pbmonster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'd attach a stronger warning to that. ""Friendly, sweet series"" means children's/young adult books in this case. Not even the same order of magnitude as Game of Thrones.  If you like it more grisly (and arguably much deeper characters, especially the villains) I can recommend the First Law series (start with The Blade Itself) or Malazan Book of the Fallen Series."

baldursgate,3d75yl,TTL4k,4,Tue Jul 14 01:26:20 2015 UTC,"Potion of mirrored eyes is broken. Potion of defense (I play a monk normally), Potion of heroism (a nice buff to fighter classes) and of course any potion that gives you +5 to saves and/or magic resistance/immunity.  Also potions that explode, they're cool.   From memory, drinking magic immunity potions removes all of your mage buffs (stoneskin and mirror image) and also maybe also your potion buffs (potion of heroism). I can't remember, maybe this was just magic immunity scrolls."
baldursgate,3d75yl,luke_luke_luke,5,Tue Jul 14 03:23:48 2015 UTC,"It might just be scrolls, as they create a small anti magic zone around the target, which is why casting them on enemy mages is OP"

I am playing a fighter cleric, Can somebody give me a rundown on what gear i should go for?  I already plan on bum rushing the ring of gaxx and Flail of ages but what about rings and armor?  Oh and i am not dual wielding... Going with a shield. Dualwielding with a flail in hand just seems so... wrong."
baldursgate,3d75yl,luke_luke_luke,2,Tue Jul 14 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"Flail of ages and a mace called ""mace of disruption"" are the 2 things that make me regret playing a party without access to flails or maces.  There are several good shields that are easy to come across. Don't sweat on which shield you normally carry. Solving issues at Trademeet will eventually give you a strong shield with many immunities that is satisfactory to wield the entire game.  Also, it's more efficient to pass around Gaax as a cheap way to heal than have it sit on the same person all game. Not that I necessarily recommend collecting the ring early RP-wise.  I haven't played an armour-wearing fighter class in a while, but I don't think that buying suits of armour is necessary as you often stumble upon strong armour during mainstream quests. Vhailor's Helm from the lady in adventures mart might be good to buy, but there are other good things to save for prior to rescuing Imoen."

One potion, for example, makes you immune to all spells and causes all saving throws to automatically succeed for the duration.  In some ways a solo game is easier because those insanely strong consumables are available only in limited numbers, so you can't buff your whole party but you've got plenty for the single character."

baldursgate,3cxfkr,berlinbrown,7,Sat Jul 11 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"You can start by giving the copper coronet a visit and cleaning the slums. It's usually the first quest I do since the fights are pretty low level and the rewards are good. Lilarcor is a good sword at the beginning and is practically free.  Another easy quest is the circus in waukeen's promenade (slight hint: hard save before heading in a new room if you haven't played it before).  In the cemetary, you can find the paladin and the orphan by day and the dead boy by night. You can complete these two quests easily (for the dead boy you will need a teddy bear, it's easy to get and it's available in the copper coronet). If you are persistent you should be able to kill the king in one of the tomb for the +2 long sword which is very good at the beginning.  If you're feeling frisky you can give Umar Hills a shot, at level 10-12 it should not be too difficult, of course you leave the dragon for later (or you can try it :) . It's doable but if you already have difficulties there is no point yet).  While moving between the areas, you should be able to start the harper's quest. If you feel like powergaming you could rig the house beforehand (if you don't know what I'm talking about, then you will find out ^^ :)"

Like is the announcement of the expansion what turned you onto the series or are you a more seasoned player who is looking for character ideas?   Any character class can beat the game, so what is ""fun"" is going to be really subjective and vary from person to person. Some people don't like fighters because they don't have cool abilities, they are just really good at hitting things, others don't like mages because they die easily and the magic system can be overwhelming if you don't know how the rock-paper-scissors of spell protection/dispel works. Personally, while I want to enjoy playing as a cleric, I've never actually enjoyed a cleric game enough to stick with it, and I don't really know why. I loved playing as a barbarian or as a blade (bard kit) though, and the totemic druid was a lot of fun for me just because I enjoyed summoning spirit animals all the time."

They can do some magic, obviously learning that from Gorion and any other mages in Candlekeep.  They can fight, learning swordskills from the guards.  They have a few thievery skills, probably learned while exploring Candlekeep and picking up a few things from Imoen.  Bards get the highest lore skill out of all the classes, which makes sense for a kid growing up in a giant library. And who enjoys learning and telling stories more than a bard?

Multiclassed mage because what kind of useless fucking godchild doesn't try and harness the power in their blood?  Really though, the two classes I can't see are standard fighter or cleric. Fighter because any moron can swing a sword, and it's a goddamn waste of divine potential for that to be the be-all and end-all of their abilities, no matter how fast or hard they're swinging it. Cleric because good and neutral gods pretty demonstrably get a bit shirty about Bhaalspawn, no matter how much they preach tolerance and redemption, while evil gods would probably withdraw their support at a good time to curtail said Bhaalspawn's rise. By and large, they like the void left by Bhaal and don't want it filled, so they have no reason to grant spells and blessings to anyone who even has the potential to step into those shoes."
baldursgate,3cw2lq,thedaemonthor,5,Sat Jul 11 07:48:00 2015 UTC,I tend to assume a Player Character Cleric just draws on their own divine power. Early on maybe without realizing what they're doing.

Especially not if they've taken a kit (which would necessitate Lathander/Helm/Talos)."
baldursgate,3cw2lq,thedaemonthor,2,Sun Jul 12 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"My understanding is you pray for the spells, as opposed to how mages memorize their spells. The deity grants you the spells in response to your prayer.  This is just the standard set up though. A literal child of the gods seems like an obvious exception to the rules when it comes to divine boons.  There are known workarounds even for normal people. Like Ur-Priests who use a form of meditation to siphon cleric spells from the gods without their knowledge or consent. So long as there's some source of divine power you can pretty much just fill in the blanks as you will."

baldursgate,3cw2lq,P1x1es,3,Sat Jul 11 10:30:01 2015 UTC,"Magical potential is totally a thing though, it's pretty likely that any kid in a keep full of mages and clerics would have at least fiddled around with cantrips, especially with their primary caretaker and foster father being a renowned mage. If their heritage shows itself in any meaningful way while doing that, they'd probably have had mage training all but forced on them in an effort not to waste that potential. Even if Gorion tried to discourage it, all it takes is one or two monks with a bit of background in magical theory who don't see the harm in passing that on to a curious youngster.

baldursgate,3cw2lq,Hipster_Bear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:50:09 2015 UTC,I wouldn't count Candlekeep as monastery. Mage/Sorc or Fighter fits it very well.
baldursgate,3cw2lq,PandaBouse,2,Sun Jul 12 13:02:24 2015 UTC,"Here's how I always saw it. Gorion adopted this kid, knowing full well who he/she was. Kept him/her safe in Candlekeep, and kept him/her ignorant of his/her history while growing up, the plan being to do the big reveal when Gorion felt the time was right. He and Elminster had a plan from the beginning.  So CHARNAME is basically a kid, not knowing his/her potential at all. Gorion I reckon would not have tried tutoring him/her in spellcasting, and might have encouraged something else. Get him/her reading, sure, to bump up INT, but in the meantime, get him/her doing something useful as well. Life skills. Gorion might not have approved of thievery, but then there's Imoen, the token manic pixie dream girl (in BG1, at any rate.) I see CHARNAME as being more responsible than Imoen, so probably not a rogue class. Seeing as I felt Gorion wanted to avoid CHARNAME being a spellcaster, I think he would have encouraged CHARNAME to take on a fighter class.  As subjective as this is, to start CHARNAME as a fighter type just feels right. CHARNAME is more responsible than Imoen as well, but I don't think he/she would be too responsible, so not a paladin. A bard (I know it's a Rogue class) might fit quite well, but I think Gorion would have encouraged more focus, rather than the jack-of-all-trades that the Bard is.  So I would see CHARNAME as being either a straight fighter or a barbarian, really. A straight fighter, because there's probably nobody to train CHARNAME as a kensai or other specialty (no dancing master in Candlekeep!)  is a possibility but given CHARNAME's potential I would think that there will still be an air of unpredictability about him/her. Red mist and all that. Not unlike the Slayer change, in fact.  So in BG1 I think CHARNAME is actually a barbarian. And only when he/she starts to learn more about his/her potential does his/her true power start to show through. Irenicus awakens the magical potential (so CHARNAME would dual shortly after finding him/herself in Athkatla). So that would make CHARNAME a human as well.  Every time I play the saga as anything other than a human Barbarian / mage now it doesn't feel quite right. Sure, it's fun to try my hand at a monk or a ranger/cleric but I can't really imagine CHARNAME growing up in other classes. Just doesn't quite sit right.  Unless of course Gorion just wanted to raise an idiot: in which case a Jester."
baldursgate,3cw2lq,MrFlabulous,2,Sat Jul 11 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the idea that Gorion would try to dissuade him from magic as some sort of evil prevention method.  Limiting the harm he could do.  For one, in FR it's fairly obvious fighters aren't considered slouches in terms of power.  It's arguable that an epic fighter is as strong as a mage or stronger, just less versatile.  But also, I think it's reasonable to say he'd see education and sharing what he loves with the child as the best defense against the taint.  He wanted him to have a happy loving home, or so we're told.  You don't get that by in the back of your mind holding someone at arms length, limiting them, and viewing them with suspicion of what they might become.  Besides, if someone wants to limit your magical potential taking you to the library fortress of mages is probably not the smartest way to go about it.  And in theory Gorion had decent int."
baldursgate,3cw2lq,haerdalisdo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"You make fair points. Could be that Gorion did intend to tutor CHARNAME in spellcasting (which would kind of back up the dualling) but wanted to wait until the time was right, or to see what other Bhaalspawn would pop up.  Don't forget that during ToB there is one last conversation with Elminster, who notes that CHARNAME is more powerful than he ever imagined. So perhaps Gorion might not have been able to spot that potential after all.  And let's face it, we know that Bhaal even mated with rabbits, so it's entirely possible that some of his mortal progeny had no divine potential at all...  Anyway, yeah, your last point kind of kills my argument, but then I realised there's a part early on when someone notes that Candlekeep is so cut off from the world that only a shortage of books would drag it back (politically) to the ""real world"". Kind of like isolationism. Let's face it, Imoen too could have been raised as a mage in Candlekeep and it doesn't happen, she duals at some indeterminate point between BG1 and BG2 (unless you choose to do so during BG1). Seeing as she's CHARNAME's (half) sister it's not a stretch to assume that CHARNAME is at least part-human, if not wholly so."

I think using what we actually know and see as real in game as the basis for a guess at his intentions is better.  He had no intention to teach charname anything specific.  He took them somewhere he thought would be safe, isolated, so they could be raised in peace.  And let them find their own way in terms of adventuring class.  That's why charname can be anything.  Gorion didn't have set intentions on what to make them, just on how to raise them.  ""Seeing as she's CHARNAME's (half) sister it's not a stretch to assume that CHARNAME is at least part-human, if not wholly so.""  She's his/her half sister in that she's a child of Bhaal... but that rabbit is also his or her half sibling due to that connection.  It in no way has any bearing on the race of charname."

baldursgate,3cw2lq,RedArremer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:01:31 2015 UTC,"My guess would be good-aligned thief.   Class: The people in Candlekeep suggest you're a bit of a troublemaker, though generally a good person, and Imoen, your only similarly-aged friend is also a thief.  Bhaal himself is said to have been an assassin in the stories about him, though it's possible the word assassin there is being used as a general term for killer (though assassin as class appears to be known in-world), and it makes sense that the prime Bhaalspawn would be drawn to his path.   If we look at 4th-wall-breaky game stuff, we can see that fate has seen fit to grace every dungeon, house, castle, and even sometimes cave you explore with traps and locks aplenty, making thief skills used more than perhaps anything else in the game. When looking at the class-related quests in BG2, I think it's fair to say that the thieves' guild is the most involved and perhaps the most interesting. It seems to me that the path of the thief is set before the Bhaalspawn in terms of both in-world lore and game design.  Alignment: I say good-aligned because the game sort of leads us toward good actions. There are people all over in need of saving and saving them is both easier and more profitable than finding an alternative path that involves not saving them or especially killing them. The neutral character will find himself doing good as it is almost universally the easier and more profitable choice; the evil character will find himself torn between the desire for gain and the vengeful/malicious/violent urges that drive him; the good character will have almost no temptation to sway from his path.   Even if a character chooses some variation of evil at the start, it's unlikely that his ""reputation"" (which clearly correlates with good deeds) will do anything but rise without a conscious effort to the contrary. In pen&paper D&D, a predilection for good deeds would merit a reevaluation of alignment. Even if done for presumably selfish reasons, a life spent doing good deeds at risk of death and harm would probably fly with the good-aligned gods to get you a spot in their afterlife domains."

baldursgate,3cts61,ArchmageXin,19,Fri Jul 10 18:38:43 2015 UTC,I've heard nothing but bad things too.   Imoen X Drow lesbian sex scene.   But now I want to read them.
baldursgate,3cts61,ARTIFICIAL_SAPIENCE,5,Fri Jul 10 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, they were far from hideous and not the slightest bit malformed. In fact, Imoen found Phaere quite compelling. The drow's skin didn't glow-it dim just the opposite. The blackness of it seemed to draw light into it, never to escape. Phaere's face was long and regal with a pronounced chin and cheekbones. Her nose was small and turned gently upward. Her eyes were big, almond-shaped, and a sparkling violet color Imoen couldn't stop staring at. Her white hair smelled as clean as it looked-even from a distance-and it cascaded down her long neck, over her tight shoulders, and down her slim back nearly to her waist.  Her body was hard from long hours of daily training. Phaere was at least two inches shorter than Imoen, but Imoen knew the drow woman could kill her with her bare hands. Imoen was attracted to her ears as well. They were perfectly shaped, symmetrical, and pointed, the tips peeking out from under her hair. Phaere's hands were lithe and smooth. There was no hint of blemish or imperfection on her at all, and the low-cut, backless robe showed enough of her to make that all the more impressive.  Imoen looked at her own hand and marveled at the deep black color.  ""I've had a bath run for you,"" Phaere said, her voice low and intimate now.   Blah blah, Phaere spills all her secrets to Imoen in the bath.   Phaere slipped closer to Imoen in the bath, sending warm waves lapping against the soft underside of Imoen's chin.  ""They have some grudge against one of the surface elves,"" Phaere said, obviously growing bored with the conversation. ""I make this elf think the great drow invasion has finally come, and in all the chaos that follows, Bodhi and Irenicus do whatever it is they've set out to do. In exchange, I get power enough to ascend to the highest position in Ust Natha.""  ""A good bargain,"" Imoen said.  When Phaere had mentioned Bodhi and Irenicus by name, another chill ran down her spine. When Phaere touched her, a sensation of an entirely different nature followed.   END SCENE. I JUST SAVED YOU TWO HUNDRED LONG BOOBLESS PAGES."

baldursgate,3cts61,ReversalofGraves,7,Fri Jul 10 23:25:31 2015 UTC,Well it's not like they invented all the spells for the game. They all came from tabletop AD&D. Goodberries just happens to be a really stupid spell in the context of BG.

baldursgate,3cts61,80-,12,Fri Jul 10 21:59:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're into.  If you want to read about Drizzt, then the Icewind Dale Trilogy by R.A. Salvatore would be a good starting point.  If you want to learn more about Elminster, then Elminster: The Making of a Mage by Ed Greenwood would be a good place to begin.  If you want to learn about the Time of Troubles, Cyric, and Bhaal, then the Avatar series, a quintet written by different authors, will give you a good rundown of the important events of that time.  It all depends on what you're interested in."
baldursgate,3cts61,Fusrodahmus,2,Fri Jul 10 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the whole thing, but The War of the Spider-Queen was a pretty interesting look at the politics between The Gods and how the effects mortal affairs. Each book is by a different author, so it provides multiple opportunities to find an author you like.  Starlight and Shadows by Elaine Cunningham is one of the more memorable Forgotten Realms Trilogies I've read. One of the main characters is a Rashemen Berserker who tends to lose himself in his rages like Minsc. The other is a Drow Priestess. Explores both of their cultures pretty neatly as their journeys intertwine."

baldursgate,3cqx6k,CelestialFury,3,Fri Jul 10 09:29:52 2015 UTC,"Makes me wonder if they are going to increase the XP-cap? I'm not sure what to hope for tho, because starting BG2 with a char who's level is too high doesn't seem like a good idea (could be wrong)"
baldursgate,3cqx6k,PandaBouse,4,Fri Jul 10 08:55:39 2015 UTC,"yes, that's one of mine biggest concerns too, if you start BG2 with  characters around level 12 or something, it would be helluva unballanced."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,errboi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:32:11 2015 UTC,"Well there is some mods for BGII that scale enemies in the beginning acts to adjust for PC's level.

baldursgate,3cqx6k,errboi,2,Fri Jul 10 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"They said the XP cap would be level 12 for Siege. I don't recall exactly how they said they'd handle the higher level importing into BG2, but maybe you could try the ""Legacy of Bhaal"" difficulty setting which is supposed to be like Heart of Fury in IWD. I think that was one of the things they were going to patch into the EE games."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,gangler52,2,Fri Jul 10 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"Its a completely easy retcon tbh, you start out being tortured by Jon Irenicus and so it follows that he ""stripped you of some divine power"". Level draining is actually a mechanic in the game."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,errboi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:31:30 2015 UTC,"it is a mechanic in the game, but it's one that is easily undone by a visit to a priest. It would take something more to permanently drain you of that experience. I suppose the hell trials permanently remove some of your experience though, so there is a precedent in the series."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,gangler52,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"They said that the expansion will be accompanied by some patches for Baldur's Gate 2 which will tweak it to better accommodate higher level imports.  They didn't specify what exactly those tweaks would entail.  Additionally Baldur's Gate 2 will be getting patched so that people can bring their shaman characters in, and getting the new UI."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,luke_luke_luke,2,Fri Jul 10 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they'll patch the shaman into BG1 as well. But yeah, you're right. Other than the shaman, they didn't specify which things would get patched in. Patching in Legacy of Bhaal or whatever it's called just seemed like a logical step to me. It would also help balance out the issues with starting BG2 at a higher level. They could also always go the ""Trauma from being tortured left you weak and confused. You're just back at level 7 now."" route."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,TTL4k,3,Fri Jul 10 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"They could. Don't think it'll be quite that severe though.  I'm assuming they mean the level cap is 12 for thieves and bards, who require the least experience to level up. With Tales of the Sword Coast the thieves and bards could already level up to 10, so that's just two levels. Probably if you're a fighter or a mage we'll only be looking at one extra level.   Probably this'll mostly just be an issue of tweaking Ironicus's Dungeon, since after that the quests are designed so that they can be done in any order. You could be a level 12 bard taking out the trolls at Nalia's place without it being a gamebreaking thing. Then of course the farther you get in the game the less the extra experience will mean."

baldursgate,3cqx6k,Watton,6,Fri Jul 10 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"Because they felt there was an untold story between BG1 and 2 they wanted to share. It's their ""love letter"" to the original IE games, seeking to combine the aspects they felt were best about each of the various IE titles.  New Class (Shaman) which they will patch into BG1 and 2 upon release, new UI with fancy new (optional) health bars above party and enemy heads, new and old characters. Other neat stuff too. 25+ hours of original content.  They said something about good games releasing before they are ready not actually being good games, and good games releasing later than expected still being good games. It sounds like they really want to put out a highly polished final product, so it could be a while. No set date yet."

Given Beamdogs previous dialogue skills(you know it's bad when I, an amateur writer, can write better than that), this can be either bad or good. I hope it's good.  An an explorer and lore type of person, I'll probably play this just to see the new backgrounds and explore a little more of Faerun.

Dorn's and Viconia's new dialog in BG2 was enough for me to uninstall and never touch the EE again, and there's going to be a whole game of that...cringe  And the guy who posted up the page is right, there is no gap between BG1 and BG2, your characters have the exact same XP when BG2 starts as they had at the end of BG1. This is just a cash grab."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,Gentlemoth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:28:30 2015 UTC,"While I may agree with you on the dialog(it was kind of bad), I don't necessarily agree this is a pure cash grab. XP is a fickle thing to measure the passing of time by, as you can have 90000 XP at the start of BG2, or 161000 XP(Tales). Is Tales also a cash grab?  It simply strikes me as odd that there is no mention of anything happening in this expansion anywhere in the canon."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,DMZ_Dragon,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"No, but the infinity engine wasn't 16 years old when they made TotSC either. They could have very easily used Unreal 4 or Source 2 engines but then they would have to do actual work instead of just copying and pasting things together. Look at their excuse for not making Icewind Dale 2 ""enhanced edition"", it's pathetic.  I don't understand, BG1 and TotSC aren't different games, when TotSC was released, the XP cap became 161,000.  And...are you kidding!? These ""enhanced editions"" are barely anything more than the original games with mods already installed. Beamdog was well aware of the popularity of Bgtutu and just packaged that for the obviously lazy modern PC gamer market...what do these guys do that ISN'T a cash grab?  And actually I forgot why I never come to the site, thanks for remninding me."
baldursgate,3cqx6k,gangler52,15,Sun Jul 12 09:12:18 2015 UTC,"Who cares about FR canon? It's been thoroughly thrown under the bus, picked up,then thrown under the bus again.   Even before WOTC completely ripped FR apart, it was a poorly thought out world with multiple writers competing to make the most powerful wizard in a literary dickwaving contest.   The only merit of the world is that it has a number of interesting places that games and GMs have been able to utilise."

baldursgate,3cqx6k,ronindog,3,Fri Jul 10 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"It's a bit ambiguous, actually.  The game version of Minsc is canon, and a big part of current events.  Viekang was also important in the recent revival of Bhaal, don't think he was in the books.  Same with Coran.  Really, the only confirmation that the books were canon was Abdel Adrian being used as the canon charname in recent story; they might have just used him because he's been the premade protag since TotSC."

Pillars of Eternity was a good example of a completely new IP. It's nice enough, but nowhere near the same as playing through the BG series. Maybe eventually if PoE turns into a mod-supported trilogy and fully fleshed out world you can invest hundreds of hours into, but that's a very long time off."

Then I bought another and played it until my friend dragged me, kicking and screaming, into the World... of Warcraft.  I want the community to have some system by which they can make endless content and tell amazing stories. Scalable content.  This one is probably quite controversial, but I want the content to scale with my characters.  I don't find level 1 fighters fun, for example, but at the same time I don't want to just steamroll over every opponent that dares cross me.  It would be nice if I could start the game at level 5 or something and have the game just increase the stats of monsters to make them an appropriate challenge for my level.  Of course, have this an option, since I feel many people would not agree with this style of play.  Note:  this scalability would be one of the game's fundamentals - so player created modules would have the same ability and it wouldn't be any extra trouble for content creators.  They could make the game and tag it ""Designed for level 3 characters"" but know that anyone from level 1 to level 50 could play it without much trouble."

Did they take away the ability to mix and match, the modular nature of things that 3.5 brought with multiclassing and prestige classes?    Did they keep the whole ""This is an Encounter power, so even though you have this ability you arbitrarily can't do it more than once.  Because bullshit.""  If so I'd say stay the hell away again.  If not I'll check it out."

There are no prestige classes but after 4th level every class can pick one of three specialisations. For example paladin can be a nature paladin magic pala or avenger pala, if I remeber them correctly.  The combat mechanics are streamlined, but not dumbed down"
baldursgate,3csgy6,joehowls,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:33:44 2015 UTC,There are no per encounter skills but there are akills that have a set amount of uses and then you need to take a short or a long rest to use them again.  Spells need a long rest but smite evil needs only a short one.  Long rest is the basic 8 hours you do in BG and short rest is 1 hour.

I admit I think spell slots are dumb and wish we could get past the Vancian casting style, but I can deal with that + needing rest as long as I can fully customize what's in them.  Basically, 4e and it's ""This is a daily power, you can only do it once, and it can only be put in a daily ""slot"" once"" was enough to make me give it the middle finger.  I like themed characters.

baldursgate,3crzjw,toxictaliban111,8,Fri Jul 10 08:14:29 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely recommend the EE games for a newcomer. The future of the game series lies with the enhanced editions, and they're a lot more friendly to new players who may not always have the knowledge of which mods they must install to make the games a bit more approachable.  As for the Forgotten Realms you'll learn a fair bit about them as you play, no real need to read novels, though some of them are very good in their own right."
baldursgate,3crzjw,P1x1es,5,Fri Jul 10 12:56:46 2015 UTC,"1) Don't bother too much and enjoy the ride. FRR is a way too long, too large Universe with over 20 Real Life years of history. There are hundreds of books, tabletop campaigns, and BG is actually way out of ""current FRR date"" anyway. Just treat BG as a stand alone Universe so you won't get overwhelmed.  Neverwinter nights I and II follow BG (time line wise), but they are not fantastic as BG story wise.   Neverwinter online is more modern-day (as in-sync with current realm time), but I am not sure how good it is.  2) I would take enhanced--it does have more content, at least BG:EE. I am not familiar with BGII EE  3) Neverwinter Night-No, the writing isn't as good, especially NWN Vanilla, which was sort of a Diablo Clone. NWN 1-2 were usually far better developed by GM/online communities, but it is unknown if any exists anymore.   I would recommend Pillar of Eternity instead, and yes, Planescape is insanely good."
baldursgate,3crzjw,ArchmageXin,5,Fri Jul 10 14:24:18 2015 UTC,"1) As others have stated, the books are pretty good, but not at all necessary. There are some easter eggs for readers of the books, but nothing to write home about.  2) Definitely get the EE versions.  3) Planescape is incredible. Definitely give it a play through. Also, if you enjoy BG, give Icewind Dale a try. I disagree with most of the posters here about Neverwinter Nights. I loved those games when I played them. I don't think the original's graphics have stood the test of time, but NWN2 still looks decent and is a good story."
baldursgate,3crzjw,-Sythen-,2,Fri Jul 10 19:26:18 2015 UTC,The Forgotten Realms novels are mostly amazing and worth a read. The authors who write them are quite talented.  Get the EE games.  I've been wanting to play PST for years but never gotten around to it. I hear it's quite good though.

NWN uses almost the same rules at KOTOR.  You don't need to read any Forgotten Realms lore in order to understand and enjoy the games.  However, if you're into it, then you can read the hundreds of in-game novels that you can find, as well as the hundreds of real-life books on Forgotten Realms.  I recommend R.A. Salvatore and Ed Greenwood."
baldursgate,3crzjw,Fusrodahmus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:25:07 2015 UTC,R.A Salvatore's writing is kind of terrible.  The whole Drizzt story line is about as bad as it gets.  Just my take.  I'd suggest starting with something more relevant to the games if that's where the interest lies.  There are books on the time of troubles.
baldursgate,3crzjw,haerdalisdo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"Feedback on the games Bg 1 and 2 I would suggest the normal versions. In my opinion the EE aren't worth it.( and yes I've played both). If your opposed to moding the game however, go for the enhanced editions.  Planescape torment is a great game, but a totally different feel. Icewind dale is a lot like bg but more combat/ dungeon crawler based. I do suggest the EE for those.  My order of preference goes bg2, PST, bg1, iwd series. But to each his own"
baldursgate,3crzjw,beruthiel86,0,Fri Jul 10 09:11:58 2015 UTC,"1) Nope  2) Well, the EE of BG1 is better because of UI and usability improvements.  The EE of BG2 vs the original of BG2 is kind of a wash.  I'd say get the EE anyway if you're going to get the EE of 1 because it gives you all your class options.  But it's not as much of a value add.  3) NWN is great for its mods and user created adventures.  Not for its original campaign.  In truth NWN1 is only redeemed by Hordes of the Underdark, the last expansion.  And NWN2... well, Neera has bad voice acting in the BGEEs and NWN2 has a character that puts HER to shame called Neeshka.  The others aren't much better.  But the expansion is better on that front.  Basically, yes play NWN, but don't play it as some sort of prep or crossover for this game.  It's just it's own thing.  As for Planescape - It's a game with an amazing story and setting that I can't play.  It's just too old, even for a BGer like me.  I hope for a remake of that one some day.  But you might have a hard time getting into it without such a thing.  Resolution issues, mods that try to address it not working, and all that jazz."

She is added at the very late stage because of lack of 'non-psychopathic' thieves in the beginning of adventure. As a result, in BG1 she has almost no reaction with other characters or quests (and totally imbalanced). This explains why she sticks with CHARNAME.   After the release of BG1, the reaction of public is very positive on Imeon's optimistic image and cheerful 'Heya! It's me, Imeon.' This makes Imeon rises from other NPCs (along with Minsc). It wins her an important place in BG2's storyline."

baldursgate,3coldu,haerdalisdo,8,Fri Jul 10 01:55:51 2015 UTC,Disagree completely. Imo getting to play and import/export the same character is a significant part of the charm of the BG games and gives continuity to the series. Introducing someone unrelated would mostly feel like a cop-out and only isolate adventure Y from the other games.
baldursgate,3coldu,SCphotog,6,Thu Jul 9 22:10:04 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Ive played BG since it came out and somehow (please don't hate me) never finished either game or expansions. I just didn't get there.  If the above is all true I think I'll grab adventure Y and make a conscious effort to finally do a full and complete  play through.

But you can't come into a story 10+ years later and just tack in extra chapters and not have it feel wrong to a lot of people.  Sorry if it bothers you.  My feedback to your company is I would give a NEW IP a shot.  I want you to try something new.  You've obviously got a love of this style of game, and an excitement for it.  I just think you're leaning so heavily on an existing IP that you're mistaking love of BG as love of what YOU did with BG.  I want to see you try and stand on your own, and I want something entirely new in that style of game, to see what you can really do.  Till then you're leeching."

A new BG game is neat and all, but the fan made chapters to the same story is not as good as Beamdog coming up with their own IE creation.  The only sense I see that /u/haerdalisdo hasn't mentioned is by making the EE games, Beamdog is working out the bugs and kinks of game development and using the long history of success of BG as a safety net.  I do wish Beamdog used the first two EE games to do this and made their third release something original, possibly releasing a BG ""middle chapter"" as a ""love letter"" to the original games free of charge to everyone.  Oh well.  What's done is done and I think we all hope it is successful."
baldursgate,3coldu,storander,4,Fri Jul 10 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"""fan made chapters to the same story is not as good as Beamdog coming up with their own IE creation.""  Maybe I'm being dense here, so I'll say this right out: Beamdog's content (starting with BG2) was professionally written by Andrew Foley (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Foley_(writer)) and Amber Scott (Formerly a writer for Dungeon and Dragon magazines, formerly a writer for Paizo).  So we aren't exactly taking fan mods and publishing them as original content.  On the other hand, if the ""fan-made chapters"" thing is a criticism of the writing of our original content, I'm not sure how writing for a new game would change the style or quality of Beamdog's writing team.   by making the EE games, Beamdog is working out the bugs and kinks of game development and using the long history of success > of BG as a safety net.    Insightful  It is worth noting that WotC does not allow crowdfunding for products using their IP, and you might have noticed an incremental increase in size & complexity of the projects we've undertaken?"

I just bought EE a few weeks ago (after years of playing the originals) and want to thank your company for porting this game to a format supported by modern systems, as well as running natively on Linux.  Regarding the upcoming Adventure Y content, I've only heard rumors that the story was inherited.  Since you're speaking officially, this changes my outlook on how the game will turn out.  In any event, I reiterate I hope this product is as successful as its predecessors.  Finally, and I hope your team takes this as constructive and not malevolently, I find the content additions to BG:EE to be a lower caliber than the original games*.  My and /u/haerdalisdo's apprehension towards jumping on the Adventure Y hype might derive from this.

Not much I can say there - she pretty much nailed what the writers were after.  What's up with the quick loot?

Beyond that I'm very happy to provide feedback but I'd need specific questions.   Do not misunderstand me.  I think you guys love the originals and want to do right. I do not accuse you of bad intentions. And in theory I'd love to work that kind of project too. I have my own view of the saga and mod ideas for kits and all that which i just haven't been able to justify sinking time into.  You're paid to do it. That's a great position. On the selfish side of it. And that's no attack.  I'd say yes too.

What's the potential cost?    My reaction is I'll be over leveled in 2   Are you aware that most of the encounters in BG2 scale difficulty with level?  (BTW, as I'm sure you know, level 12 isn't the same amount of XP for all classes, and like the other games it is an XP cap.  Without saying more than I should, it isn't as bad as it sounds)   nothing of true significance can happen due to the place you're trying to add this into chronologically   There are several months chronologically between the two, so there's time for a bit of an adventure in there :)  We have plans to publish a bit of a story before release to help set the stage.   Beyond that I'm very happy to provide feedback but I'd need specific questions.   I was mostly interested in hearing from folks who watched the twitch stream, where Phil Daigle gave the backstory and intro to the plot.  You can watch it on twitch.tv/beamdog, and click on ""Watch Beamdog's Last Broadcast!"".  Skip the first 10 minutes (bad sound, and it is mostly Trent talking about Beamdog and less so about the game)."
baldursgate,3coldu,P1x1es,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:54:43 2015 UTC,I stand by it being just a marketing quote. It is good policy to NEVER trust anything that went through anyone's marketing team.  But it's a little too pointed towards the bugbear to not be calculated. I need not know why it benefits someone to see it for what it is.   I turned off due to the sound issues last night.

baldursgate,3coldu,haerdalisdo,3,Sun Jul 12 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's an exercise in futility. They basically have everything going against them by trying to make a ""mid-sequel"" like this."
baldursgate,3coldu,P1x1es,7,Thu Jul 9 18:37:30 2015 UTC,"I don't see why. The enhanced editions released so far have already shown there's a market among BG-fans who are hungry for new content. And a mod community thriving for more than a decade before that proved there's room for a whole lot of additional content in the BG-saga, even if all of it isn't for everyone."
baldursgate,3coldu,orcusmalorcus,4,Thu Jul 9 22:15:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but the EE content basically stinks when you use the original as a measuring bar.
baldursgate,3coldu,orcusmalorcus,9,Thu Jul 9 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"While I agree the EE content, especially in BG1, wasn't all that impressive, I think you're taking a shortsighted stance. Beyond the additional content itself, the EE project has revitalized the series.  The game engine has been improved beyond what it could do in the ToB days, the old modding community got a lot of new people trying their hand at creating content, and the game series itself got many new players who hadn't heard of BG before.  And now a few years down the road, we're getting a completely new BG game, which, even if it isn't all that, could still tie up loose ends and be a worthwhile addition to the saga. Heck, to some people ToB was an unworthy finale not up to the quality of the other two games, but it's still very nice to have it there as an option. And again, even if the content of adventure Y tanks completely, its production has - as far as has been gathered - resulted in even further improvements of the infinity engine and what its capable of; improvements that will eventually be incorporated into existing games."
baldursgate,3coldu,macbalance,-8,Fri Jul 10 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"No, it couldn't tie up loose ends and be a worthy addition.  Because it's not really a BG game.  Even if it were good, and if the EE content is a predictor it will be mediocre, it's a fanfic tacked on to the middle of all places.  Since we know the whole beginning and we know the whole end then 0 content of actual importance can be added.  As for improvements, if you mean the introduction of bugs and a few meh kits maybe.  Modding has done everything the EE has done.  All EE provides that is value, in my opinion, is ease of installation over Tutu and easy download from Steam or GoG.  And even if it made the engine truly expand, none of that justifies a bad fanfic game.  That's what this will be guaranteed."
baldursgate,3coldu,Goins2754,3,Fri Jul 10 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"Well, even if all your fears end up realized and there's nothing for you in Siege of Dragonspear, it's not like you're forced to incorporate it into your BG game; you can simply not buy it and pretend it doesn't exist, like some people do with ToB. However, that doesn't in any way make the endeavour an ""exercise in futility"". The EE releases have been well received so far, and I'd think the odds look good for Dragonspear getting the same."
baldursgate,3coldu,macbalance,0,Fri Jul 10 02:16:45 2015 UTC,"You guys need to realize that ""Well you don't have to buy it"" isn't some instant win argument to tell people who aren't hyped.

I'd give it a shot and stop bitching to boot."
baldursgate,3coldu,codifier,3,Fri Jul 10 10:29:32 2015 UTC,"Perhaps if you guys realized that your personal lack of interest or your desire to keep the BG games unchanged forever doesn't in any way mean the whole thing is futile or pointless, as was pretty much the point of this particular reply thread."

Insquisitor would be a strong pick, especially with a party. He gets a massive boost with the easy access to ridiculously good magical armour/weapons for a low level character. The dispel magic makes him strong against casters.  Obviously a pure pure/kitted mage can win your party any mob fight with glitterdust, fireball or confusion at lower levels, and is extremely important to strip the defenses of casters in later levels.  An honourable mention to the monk. Definitely not a powerhouse until level 15, but it has some things going for it at earlier levels. In BG EE it may still be the worst possible kit to take, but there are ways to mitigate this.  In BG EE bracers of AC 8 etc. actually stack cumulatively with your AC bonus, as does the shield amulet (even though they shouldn't). I can't remember if the potion of defense stacks. The sun soul monk can cause spell failure in casters, and the stunning blow in the vanilla monk kit is incredibly useful and reliable when you start being able to do 2 attacks per round and the opponents have shitty saves still. The movement bonus makes this kit able to kite wolves etc. far safer than other classes, which is handy for the first 5 levels.    The bracers don't stack in BG 2 EE (it would be broken if they did) and you start out pretty weak still. However, if you are patient you will become insanely powerful mid-game onwards with less micromanagement than a caster class. You really need to abuse the draw upon holy might ability and the kits stealth skills to get any serious work done out of the class.  If you are a completionist, run a party of 4-5 and stack some permanent bonuses Lug the mad and a good hell trial reward and items you should be able to get a magic resistance of over 100% by the end of BG2 (assuming no level cap).  By the end of BG 2 you will start having a higher armour class than other frontline classes wearing the best armour, and you will have insane numbers invested into the move silently and hide in shadows skills (over 100 if you haven't been investing into detect traps). You will also start dishing out some respectable damage from level 12 onwards (finally).  By the underdark, if you've done most of the quests in chapter 2, you can fairly easily solo the beholders lair with your monk (though a party member casting dispel magic on you when a hold spell gets through your magic immunity and ridiculously low saves is always welcome)."
baldursgate,3cqppd,luke_luke_luke,3,Fri Jul 10 01:12:31 2015 UTC,Berserker or Kensai Mage dual if you can stomach going to 13.  Sorcerer
baldursgate,3cqppd,haerdalisdo,2,Fri Jul 10 01:46:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say berserker 9 -> mage dual is better, since you reach practically the same power level, and you waste less time dealing with a useless character."
baldursgate,3cqppd,ifarmpandas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say if you're aiming for maximum power, 13.  If you're aiming for playability 9.  But you do lose some oomph.  This question was asking about power."
baldursgate,3cqppd,haerdalisdo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:26:57 2015 UTC,"You lose 1/2 APR, which isn't much at end game. Dualing at 9 lets you reach your power spike (without investing effort into scrolls or delaying quests) in the more relevant parts of the game.  So in effect, the character will be more powerful compared to more enemies by dualing faster (or you'll spend more time cheesing it with scrolls by dualing slower)."
baldursgate,3cqppd,ifarmpandas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Right.  So like I said, playability at 9.  Raw power end game at 13.  We're not disagreeing, you're just arguing to be argumentative."
baldursgate,3cqppd,haerdalisdo,2,Sat Jul 11 04:07:21 2015 UTC,"I think a good answer to this question would be a quick breakdown of my team for the Black Pits v.2.0.  I had:  A Berserker(14)->Mage(27).  This is probably my favorite.  Classically, we dual at 13 but I wasn't paying attention.  I traded one THAC0 for one fewer spell (8th circle if memory serves).  Great pick.  Inquisitor.  Really good for newer players, and still a noteworthy pick for experts. See /u/luke_luke_luke 's notes.  Cleric/Ranger multiclass.  One of the best front-liners.  Ironskins && DaHM yields: a divine caster && a fighter with 20+ in STR/DEX/CON who shrugs off physical attacks. I'm not sure if I agree that this is an under-appreciated class.   Kensai(24) -> Thief (28).  Okay, hear me out.  IF you are looking for the best thief IMO and IF you don't need to make it practical in the actual saga (like the Black Pits) this is my pick.  All those Kensai levels rack up serious bonuses, including max fighter THAC0 and Grandmastery (Staves are a good choice, here), and a few GWW's.  Then dual over to a thief and max out your thief skills with time to regain your fighter abilities and UAI and enough spike traps to kill whatever lurks in the Watcher's Keep.  This is the perfect mid-field support when paired with a Fighter/Mage.  Swashbuckler (15) -> Mage (28).  If I did the math correctly, this class is basically a full-powered mage with the benefits of 15 levels of Swashbuckler stacked on top, including small AC and THAC0 bonuses, all the thief utility you need, and most importantly 10 levels of thief hitpoints.  Finally, I would wrap this team up with one of my honorable mentions, either a Sorcerer or a Cleric/Mage.  Never hurts to have more magical firepower."
baldursgate,3cqppd,TheNalgenie,2,Fri Jul 10 18:43:04 2015 UTC,"I say under appreciated because I never hear them mentioned. People talk about blades and kensai -> mage and inquisitor. I've never heard someone rave about the cleric/ranger. My personal favorite, though."
baldursgate,3cqppd,TheNalgenie,3,Fri Jul 10 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Kensage is usually the one mentioned first, but the Cleric/Ranger is right up there. It did make my top 5, after all. It's definitely better than the Inquisitor, I think. It gets both spells he gets and FoA+Crom Faeyr probably trumps Carsomyr anyway."
baldursgate,3cq7p6,BestDmanNA,5,Thu Jul 9 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"In BG1, the benefit is an extra attack (with penalties to hit).  That's it.  In BG2, another benefit is getting the effects of the offhand weapon while still using an exceptional primary.  e.g., 25 strength, extra attack (with the main hand), ability to summon creatures, etc."
baldursgate,3cq7p6,80-,3,Thu Jul 9 22:24:17 2015 UTC,"There are countless one handed weapons that have great effects but aren't great primary weapons.  Basically think of it this way.  In the NWN games items are all +1/2/3/4/whatever with spell effects.  But in the BG series there are a lot of truly unique weapons with way more powerful effects than the shields.    AND the defensive magic available is far more ""I hard counter you"" than in later D&D editions... I mean, mirror image and stoneskin are basically sheets of defense.  They guard against a 1 hp hit or a 2000 hp hit.  In later D&D it doesn't work that way, but in this game?  You are immune till they run out.  Protection from magic weapons and normal weapons is actually available so you can get full immunity to all physical attacks, even.  So if you learn to work around the weaknesses you have 0 need for a shield, or the minor defensive bonuses of single weapon.  The only contender is two hander, and the items there are good, just not as good as having two items at once in play."
baldursgate,3cq7p6,haerdalisdo,2,Fri Jul 10 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"When you use two weapons, there are major penalties to your THACO(ability to hit the enemy), particularly with your off-hand weapon.  The two weapon fighting style mitigates those penalties.  That's literally the only thing it does.  Basically, two weapon fighting is only better than single weapon style or two-handed weapon style when you have two weapons with great effects that you want active at the same time.  For instance, some weapons give you an extra attack per round, give you 25 strength, that sort of thing."
baldursgate,3cq7p6,Fusrodahmus,2,Thu Jul 9 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"Basically, two weapon fighting is only better than single weapon style or two-handed weapon style when you have two weapons with great effects that you want active at the same time.   In vanilla BG2, a pure Fighter with Grandmastery in a weapon will max out at 2(!) attacks per round(1 base, + 0.5 at level 7, +0.5 for Specialization). Getting an extra attack per round from off-hand weapon is basically 50% increase in damage output. It's huge, extra effect or not.  In vanilla BG Grandmastery gives you another full attack, which means you max out at 3. Even so, offhand is still 33% increase in DPS.  I don't know which version EE picked."
baldursgate,3cq7p6,Plugawy_Nedznik,2,Fri Jul 10 11:35:30 2015 UTC,"You get an additional attack per round simply from dual wielding, but you also get heavy penalties to hit rolls. Putting pips into two weapon style reduces these penalties until you can fight almost as well with two weapons as you could with one."

baldursgate,3ck8cm,Sondergang,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, getting to the final fight is something I've spent a lot of time looking at.  If you have defeated balthazar (as triggered by the game seeing: BALTH.CRE = dead), the pocket plane dialog will change from ""Where do you wish to go?"" to ""Your destiny is nearly complete"".  Then, one of two dialog options are displayed. They both say ""I am ready. It is time for the end."" but one is only displayed when you have completed all the challenge rooms, the other is only displayed when you have not (and clicking it tells you to go finish your challenges).  You don't have to complete the challenges in any particular order, and can in fact skip the challenge rooms completely with some tricky dialog work.  If you already tried    CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(""ChallengesDone"",""GLOBAL"",1)   and still couldn't get in, that means the game does not think you have killed balthazar. If you did kill him and the game thinks you didn't, I'd love to take a look at your save game because that could have some amazing speedrunning implications."
baldursgate,3ck8cm,Smilge,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"I can give you the save file, but I do not know how to give it to you.

I've also done some modding to increase APR, but that only works on my other saves."
baldursgate,3ck8cm,Smilge,2,Thu Jul 9 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"Well I took a look at the game files, and EE has actually added another requirement to get either of those two ""It is time for the end"" dialogs to appear:  OR(2) GlobalLT(""OHN_TOB_PLOT"",""GLOBAL"",7) GlobalGT(""OHN_TOB_PLOT"",""GLOBAL"",14)   So if your OHN_TOB_PLOT variable is between 7 and 14, it will only offer you the two options of staying in the pocket plane or going back to where you were. I'm assuming this new variable has to do with some new EE character's quest, and since I haven't gotten through them all yet I'm don't really want to spoil it for myself by looking it up.  So the fix would be:  CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(""OHN_TOB_PLOT"",""GLOBAL"",15)   Or you could just teleport to area 6200 as you did. Or you could try to finish up whatever new EE quest you're apparently on, though I have no idea what that would entail or whether it would work."
baldursgate,3ck8cm,Smilge,2,Thu Jul 9 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"That really reminds me of something that I forgot. Neera was in my party, and I did go to Thay to bust them up. I killed the high traitor lady, and was met by the spooky necromancer. I don't remember how I went about it, but I absolutely destroyed him, and he came with two dialogues that I don't completely remember. I think the second one was in caps, and post enter press, I was back to the original grove, where Neera cast her Reckless Dweomer. She didn't say anything at all, so I felt like there was little closure on that quest. I think I did this after both Sendai and Abazigal, and probably after Balthazar."

baldursgate,3cf19x,TTL4k,7,Tue Jul 7 12:09:55 2015 UTC,"No, it is not pointless.  Only protection (armor) modifies are non-cumulative, with the exception of a few items (like the Ring of Earth Control in D'Aneise Keep / Ring of Gaxx).  However, magic items can do lots of other great things, in addition to boosting your armor class.   Immunity to: Level Drain, Silence, Death Magic, etc. Increased elemental resistance: Fire/Cold/Electric/Acid etc. Haste Freedom of movement Increased attributes Bonus spells   To name a very few.  If your fighter is in full plate +3, he does not need to wear a ring of protection +3 to get the same benefit.  This allows him an extra item slot to use to buff anything other than armor."
baldursgate,3cf19x,AHans,2,Tue Jul 7 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't found an enchanted set of armor that has really been mindblowing good so far.  Yeah acid resistance and fire resistance is nice but i prefer having added AC through rings and better saving throws.   The ring of gaxx is nice though, Godly as a matter of fact. It's good you can use it with magical armor, Otherwise i could see a lot of people being upset having to fight all of those bullshit liches to end up not being able to wear it.  That's how i felt when i got the practical defense.... So not fucking worth all of that trouble."

baldursgate,3cf19x,80-,2,Tue Jul 7 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with the list but I don't see anything ""mindblowing good"" per OP's description*.  Some of the ToB stuff is ok (boots of speed built into armor, etc), but nothing comparable to what Gaxx is to rings.  * Robe of Vecna is considered epic, but not armor."
baldursgate,3cf19x,AHans,4,Wed Jul 8 00:54:57 2015 UTC,"Right, that's reasonable, and I sort of agree...  To be clear, I didn't declare ""You will"", that was MsgGodzilla...  However, I think we should take a step back and get some perspective.  What is ""mind-blowingly good"" in the context of what can I think up? vs what is ""mind-blowingly good"" in the context of what is available.  In the context of Baldur's Gate 2, Full Plate +3 is pretty good.  -2 Base AC is about the best you can hope for.  Just because you can think of a number that is lower than -2 base AC does not diminish the quality of the armor in question.  (To be fair, I can and have modded armor that is much lower, so i appreciate where you're coming from - but we're talking about what's there without cheating [and I do not own the new versions])  Let's also look in the context of what's available given the OP's general train of thought, that he'd rather use non-magical armor and equip a magical ring.  In that context, you will have the same base -2 AC, and you will be using 2 item slots to get there instead of 1.  Let's legitimately weight the options, you can go:  Full Plate Ring of Prot +2/3 (Depending on if you side with Bodhi) Ring of Gaxx  Or:  Shuruppak's Plate Ring of Gaxx Ring of Earth Control  ceteris paribus, you will have: -4 AC, Ring of Gaxx benefits, +3 save  compared to -5 AC, Ring of Gaxx benefits, +1 dex, +20% fire resistance, and earth elemental charm. (or a ring of free action)  Relatively speaking, it's much better to use the magical armor.  Night and day difference.  Combine that with the fact that you can only get 1 Ring of Prot +3.  I guess what it boils down to is, any gear combination you come up with using non-magical armor I can most likely exceed using magical armor.  (Depending on what we value).  And the advantages of magical armor really starts to compound if we're trying to outfit an entire party optimally.  Maybe the TL/DR of this is:  What ""mindblowingly good"" rings/cloaks/necklaces are you thinking of that can't be equipped with magical armor?  Because I can't think of any."
baldursgate,3cf19x,AHans,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"There are not exactly magical rings that are ""mindblowingly good"" for defense either.  I'm aware of a [single] Ring of Protection +2, and a [single] Ring of Protection +3 (that you may not be able to get based on your faction line).  To each their own I suppose, but my play-style is for all tanks:   +Heavy Armor w/ magical enchantments   +Ring of Regeneration/Ring of Gaxx   +Ring of Fire Resistance  Send the Melee's in, and chain-fireball the ever-living hell out of them & my unfortunate enemies.  Anyways, the point remains, if you can wear Full Plate +2 armor but elect for non-magical in order to wear a +2 ring, really you're using that single [ring] slot for a +2 modifier to all saving throws.  (Also there are several sets of [equivalently] full plate +3, but only 1 +3 ring, so if you have more than 1 melee character, you're sacrificing AC)  End game I typically have better rings for use.  Edit: more info about Ring of Prot +3."

I love giving the best magical armor to my cleric or fighter/druid in addition to the earth control ring. I also rotate a ring of regeneration around the party, so between the mirror image ring, fire resistance ring and the ring of regeneration I don't care that they can't wear rings of protection. Necklaces are a bit trickier, but they can always get a crappy 5% magical resistance necklace (and normally do).  edit; fighter/druid (Jaheira), not druid"
baldursgate,3cf19x,dsaitken,2,Wed Jul 8 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Protection rings, cloaks and amulets - to me - always seemed like something to use on wizards/sorcerers/bards not fighters"
baldursgate,3cf19x,theevilyouknow,2,Tue Jul 7 23:34:00 2015 UTC,"Early on in SoA I'd say the bonus saving throws from a ring/neck/cloak of protection far outweigh any of the benefits of magical armor for plate wearers. Full Plate and a +2 protection item is the way to go. For leather wearers though generic studded leather is pretty poor and some of the magical leather armors are pretty bonkers; I'm lookin at you Human Flesh +5. Shadow Dragon Scale is also good. There are some pretty good sets of elven chain too for the nonplate wearers out there.  By the time you get to the end of SoA and into ToB though your saves are a lot lower, especially if you take advantage of items like Ring of Gaxx and Cloak of Balduran, and there are a lot more items out there for defending against magic, and the magical armors are much better. Some notable sets:  SPOILERS  Aslyferund Elven Chain - This set is excellent for fighter/mages who didn't get the pro normal weapons bhaalspawn ability. You can combine this with the spell ""Protection from Magical Weapons"" to render yourself completely immune to all physical attacks.  Blue/Red/White Dragon Plate, Shadow Dragon Scale - The dragon scale armors are all solid sets with excellent AC in their relative class and being practically immune to an element will always have its uses.  Enkidu's Full Plate - Excellent AC, immunity to backstab, and +5% magic resistance. 5% may not seem like much but it can stack up quick. Magic Resist is the best way to protect against things that don't grant a save and damage spells that do half damage on save.  Grandmaster's Armor - The best AC you can get on leather and gives you the benefits of boots of speed freeing up your boot slot. Also it looks awesome and has a sweet backstory. My favorite armor when I play a thief or stalker, which I usually do.  Human Flesh +5 - +4 to saving throws and +25% magic resist is just completely bonkers. This stuff will allow you do completely demolish any sort of magic based enemy.  Shuruppak's Plate - Nothing fancy but the same excellent AC of all enchanted plate mails, a decent bonus to fire resist, and +1 Dex. Dex may seem out of place but it can be good on ranged fighters and thieves wanting to be cute with Use Any Item. Believe it or not Keldorn and Sarevok can do some serious damage (pun intended) with a good crossbow if you wanted to try something different.  /SPOILERS"
baldursgate,3cf19x,Plugawy_Nedznik,2,Wed Jul 8 05:18:44 2015 UTC,There is a mod for that(that lets you wear multiple magical protection items simultaneously).
baldursgate,3cf19x,ReversalofGraves,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"No, magical armors are in good place in the game.   Magical protective items are limited to 1 per user. No matter if it is armor, ring, cloak and amulet. It is to prevent stacking to a ridiculous AC. (In comparison, the amount of THAC0 boosting items are very rare.)   Considering the slot effectiveness, end-game magical armors generally grant you a -2/-3 base AC which is the same as a full plate plus a protection +3 ring. It saves you a ring slot in exchange of +3 saves. Since rings of protection are not very common in the game, these armors serve their places as 'effective protection item' or at least a transition item.   Also, powergaming is not the only thing BG got! There are people letting Keldorn wore his old armor in whole saga. Other factors like roleplaying or alternative outcomes let your items be useful in specific aspects."

baldursgate,3cf19x,dCLCp,2,Tue Jul 7 17:48:06 2015 UTC,Is it cheating by definition? Yes.   Is it game breaking when this rule is crossed? Depends. The item itself doesn't provide any utility other than base AC. The -5 AC is very great in SoA but not that impressive in ToB.   I personally don't bring them out because the process is troublesome and balancing issue. But -5 is the best base AC that one can acquire so you may want to keep it if you want powergaming.

baldursgate,3ca2il,AJohnsonOrange,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't agree about FR being super interesting (it's mostly campy.  The game thrived on it's characters not it's setting) BUT I agree that the saga is complete and ""In between DLC"" the game is a bad idea.  Any game between 1 and 2 cannot significantly raise the xp cap without breaking the beginning of BG2.  So it'll be short, or it'll be super grindy.  And while it might work out better than it did with BG2 because they'll have more control and will be better able to make a consistent experience, the writing of characters in the EE felt like it was on par with the weakest of BG2 not the strongest.  So I wouldn't expect an experience that holds up.  Just my take.  It's no slight on beamdog really, I'm comparing them to THE game.  Best western RPG of all time to most.  But they're playing in that playground and should expect to be told when they don't measure up.  Neera & co just don't measure up to your Viconias and Jaheiras and Sarevoks."
baldursgate,3ca2il,haerdalisdo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"I kinda like FR, after all it was my first rpg system (and I guess many people can say the same).  As for the game, it will be very awkward if the rumor's are true. Setting new game between 1 and 2, is not only hard plot wise, but also mechanically, like you said."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,TeaIsExplosive,7,Sun Jul 5 21:03:12 2015 UTC,"This all boils down to micro-controlling every fight for a getting a 50/50 at the clean-up fight; which gets boring, tedious, frustrating and makes me want to quit.   The game actually is built around micromanagement. It's set up so you can pause mid battle and give everybody commands, a feature that you're supposed to use extensively.  Dying frequently is also normal. The game has a quicksave feature precisely because you're expected to regularly die, try again.  If this aspect of the game doesn't appeal to you this might just genuinely not be your sort of game, which is fine. Different strokes for different folks and all that."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,gangler52,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:55:08 2015 UTC,"I might have expressed myself poorly in the micro-managing. I like micro-managing overall, I did it in DA:O too and the better I got at it, the better my fights went. What my impression is in BG is that when I micromanage at my hardest my chance of getting slaughtered goes down from 100% to 70%; I just seem to not get better at it; which results in spamming Cloudkill and is unfun (after a while). This didn't seem the way the game was meant to play, so I figured I did something wrong.  Dying frequently is not really an issue. I approach something wrong, enemy mage got a fireball off; I die, I understand reload. It's the losing so much health no matter how hard I try that gets me. When there's no more healing I have to go to the next fight wounded and no amount of reloading can fix these odds."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,gangler52,2,Mon Jul 6 12:00:08 2015 UTC,"Part of your problem might be that this is a DnD based game. Everything's based on simulated dice rolls, meaning the chance component is a bit heavier than in games like Dragon Age.  Losing health is also inherant to the system. Where in a game like Dragon Age your guys just sort of naturally recover once the battle's over, here the damage stays with you until you heal yourself. A lot of people just keep a bunch of healing potions for that purpose. There's plentiful healing potions to be bought and throughout the game you'll make far more money than you're really able to do anything with anyway. Personally that doesn't really sit right with me. Tend to rely more heavily on healing spells.  Even with all that though you should be able to get through most battles pretty reliably once you've learned your way around the system. A whole lot changes just through learning how to use your mage.  Like, you've expressed worries about reserving spells, but if you know what you're doing you can use spells pretty sparingly and still have a huge impact. Thing is, the game's got a lot of spells, some are more useful than others and some are only useful in certain situations. Like, you can get through most of BG1 using Blind and Sleep alone, where I'm still not actually sure when if ever you'd want to use the Infravision spell.  Typically using mages to incapacitate opponents is a pretty solid bet in my opinion though. Throw Glitterdust over some enemies and suddenly they can't land hits on your armored fighters worth a damn. Can just send your fighters to hack away with impunity. Slow is also great for that. Once you've learned the spell sequencer you can inflict both of them on a group at the same time for additional effect.  There's a lot of tricksy stuff they don't even explain in the spell descriptions too. Like, when an enemy is blinded they legit can't see you. They used to just stand in place but I think Beamdog patched it up so they run around like chickens with their heads cut off in hopes of accidentally running into you. This means if you're so inclined you can have archers fire at them with impunity. Or you can blind enemy archers so now they can't shoot anybody that's not right in front of their face.  Lots of stuff to experiment with."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,gangler52,2,Mon Jul 6 14:19:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, and I meant to put this in the other post but I forgot.  Summoning spells are also great for damage mitigation. You can have your mage create a bunch of little temporary bodies to throw into the battlefield. They just disappear after the spell wears off so you don't have to worry about healing them after the fact. Every hit they take is a hit your fighters don't.  Good to check up on how each summon works though. Some are mindless and will be cool with whatever. Some have a limited free will, and will turn on you if you hurt them. Some are very willful and will lock your mage in a mental battle for dominance, leaving him defenseless to other attackers, only finally serving you if your mage comes out victorious. Some of the higher level demons are completely uncontrolled, but can't see you if you're under the effect of the Protection from Evil spell. So you just sort of let them rampage indiscriminately while staying off their radar.  The druids Nymph if I recall actually even comes with its own AI, and will act to serve you without being ordered. But it's kind of annoying since it can be hard to make it actually follow your plan to the letter. Like you leave it unattended for two seconds and suddenly it starts getting its own ideas for how it can help out. Think you might be able to make it stop by turning off the AI for the whole party but I've always found that feature confusing."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Smilge,5,Mon Jul 6 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"Fighting is too hard   Basically it's about learning strengths and weaknesses of enemies. Undead are very powerful, but there are also some very powerful spells made specifically to counter undead. Shoot, a high level priest has an AOE fear/instakill that can be cast automatically every 6 seconds. Aside from that, there are also a few weapons that will destroy undead in a single blow. Finally, mummies are resistant to most attacks except fire, which they will take extra damage from. If disease is a problem, don't let them hit you. That's why mummies walk so slowly.  For the fallen paladins, humanoid creatures are susceptible to holds, charms, and confusion. Take advantage of that and you may be able to let them kill themselves.  The loser mage is a loser, I ended up having to give him a talisman to send him back to the mage camp since it was frustrating to try to keep him alive. Alternatively, insect swarm (and insect plague) is one of your best answers to mages, as well as silence and deafness for similar effects. Or you can try to get them to waste spells on summoned creatures.   Follow-up: Health and Healing   Modern games put much more emphasis on ""plate guys up front, mages in the back"" but I haven't found that to work very well in BG2. Armor doesn't actually mitigate damage at all, it just makes it less likely to connect. Depending on enemy THAC0, the difference between plate and cloth can be fairly negligible.   Mages have spells that can not only lower their AC to be similar to that of a fighter, but they also have mirror image and stoneskin, which will negate a successful attack. For that reason, I have found them to be the best ""tanks"" in the game. And because the focus is on not taking damage, you don't need to worry about healing.  If you want to get really tricky, you can pump a character's fire resistance above 100%, meaning fire damage will actually heal the character. Then you can send them in, launch fireballs from the back, and watch as enemies die and your character(s) get healed.   Mages   I don't think AOE damage is why mages are good. As mentioned before, they make the best tanks in the game. They can also use disabling spells to make the work easier for your fighters. Hold spells do work, especially if you throw down a greater malison first. And landing a hold on an enemy basically means the enemy is dead. Charm and confusion spells can also make a difficult fight completely trivial.   Resting a lot is fine, but you don't have to do it that way. Just use your spells sparingly. Maybe you don't need to cast anything to get through this pack of orcs; better to save those magic missiles for a dragon later on. Also, it's usually a good idea to use your spell slots on spells that are always good (magic missile) rather than ones that could possibly be good in the right situation (protection from petrification)."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Smilge,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such an extensive explanation! What you're saying is to use mages efficiently and as disablers, and Stoneskin them up when they're in danger. But when they're in danger it's usually too late to buff 'em up (since they're under attack). Also, this seems applicable when I'm facing few foes, but I feel overwhelmed by the 5 paladins or 5 mercenaries. I don't have the resources to be smart about it (is what I feel). I can cast Hold on the captain, send Yoshimo and Jaheira to distract the target and the attacker of my mage and in the mean time Minsc is getting chunked every 3 seconds by the rest of their team. Other people suggested buffing my main fighters, I'll try that, so slotting lots of holds, lots of buffs and two fireballs."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,ReallyStein,6,Mon Jul 6 12:33:40 2015 UTC,"What you're saying is to use mages efficiently and as disablers, and Stoneskin them up when they're in danger. But when they're in danger it's usually too late to buff 'em up (since they're under attack).   Stoneskin lasts 12 hours, so your mage(s) should always have stoneskin up all the time. You can even cast it, rest, and still have 4 hours of stoneskin left.  Here's how I'd approach the paladin fight with a mage:   Spirit armor and Stoneskin should already be on your mage Cast blur and mirror image on your mage (or protection from normal weapons in this particular case). Walk mage into the middle of all the fallen paladins Everyone else focuses down one paladin at a time while they swing pointlessly at your buffed up mage. Mage should probably just be ready to recast stoneskin/mirror image as they wear off, but can also use hold person (which is an AOE spell by the way)   So yeah, sorry if I was unclear, but minsc should not be getting attacked at all. All enemies should attack your mage, and your mage should be impervious to harm as long as the spells hold up.   Other people suggested buffing my main fighters, I'll try that, so slotting lots of holds, lots of buffs and two fireballs.   Mages don't really have party buffs aside from haste. You can buff your fighters all you want, but they are not going to be better tanks than your mage."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Plugawy_Nedznik,3,Mon Jul 6 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"This!  These are the basics for keeping a mage alive as a tank.  You, /u/TeaIsExplosive , can even take this a step further by using spells such as sequencers and contingency spells. The earliest versions of these come at spell level 4 and 6, respectively.   The former stores spells into a single ”trigger"" that is kept in the mages ability slot. It can be used to store both offensive and defensive spells and when used will cast them without delay - for example casting 2 magic missiles instantly or perhaps applying blur and mirror image all at once in the heat of battle.   The latter creates a so called contingency which cast spells automatically under a specific circumstance. An example would be to apply stoneskin when your mage is at 70% health or perhaps to cast a fireball when an enemy is sighted. A high level mage is able to clear an entire room like this just by seeing the enemy.   Both of these spell types can be cast, removed from the spell book in favor of something else, rest up, and they’ll still remain ready to be used.   It’s a lot of fun to experiment with and turns your mage into an absolute beast!"
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Smilge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if you have a proper tank up front(18DEX, full plate, shield, preferably extra from magical items, all in all you should aim for something like -10AC) then up until ToB you have little to worry about(as in: enemies will have trouble hitting you at all except for natural crits) except for ""bosses"".  In ToB things get kind of retarded and the entire DnD kind of falls apart completely with Fire Giants, demons, and +3 equipped humanoids around every corner. Then again you get HLAs which are usually also pretty stupid."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:58:14 2015 UTC,"At -10 AC, an enemy with 9 THAC0 or higher will only hit on critical hits. You're right, that is great for many of the lesser creatures in SoA (though I'd argue that type of playstyle really shines in BG1).  However, there are quite a few exceptions to the rule. The fallen paladin fight, for instance, has you fighting against Anarg. He's got a THAC0 of 0, which means he's hitting about 50% of the time on -10 AC.  Now let's look at a Neera with a few defensive buffs. She's got 17 DEX, which puts her at 7 AC. Spirit armor brings that down to -2, and blur knocks that down to -5. Let's say we don't have any items to spare, so that's all Neera gets. Instead of Anarg hitting your fighter 50% of the time, he'll hit Neera 75% of the time. Pretty negligible difference. With stoneskin and mirror image to absorb those hits, it's pretty clear who is the better tank in this situation.  I'll reiterate that -10 AC is fine for a lot of SoA, especially on difficulties other than insane. Anarg is just unusually tough. But there are very few situations where I would say that a fighter is a better tank than a mage, even if fighters are sufficient most of the time."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,theevilyouknow,2,Tue Jul 7 14:34:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, mages make absolutely better tanks in the end. I'm just pointing out that the Fighter tank works if done correctly.  Personally I don't like the mage approach to tanking simply because it's not sustainable - sooner or later you will simply run out of spells and then all you have is a robe. You can rest to replenish spells, but then you find that it takes you three days of in-game time to clear a small dungeon because of the constant resting, which just seems silly."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Electric999999,5,Tue Jul 7 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"Like everyone has said, combat is very much about smart counter play and controlling the encounter. Also, there are a lot of broken interactions in BG once you learn them, for example death spell instakilling all summoned enemies.   There's a really good guide on gamefaqs that rates and explains all the spells. I would highly recommend reading that as it will teach you all the hidden strengths different spells have as well as giving you an idea of what abilities you should use for different encounters.  The big thing to get past is that BGII isn't about pouring out as much damage as possible like most rpg's. Damage in most fights is largely irrelevant. You simply need to control the fight and eventually your enemies will die. Defensive spells/abilities and status effects are the name of the game. Hold/charm/confusion/fear are all stupidly powerful in BGII and protecting yourselves against them is absolutely essential. That's the reason why I have always preferred Berserkers despite a large majority of people preferring kensais. The berserker's ""enrage"" ability renders you immune to a large majority of the status effects in the game.   If you don't want to play a berserker though, cleric's and paladins have a spell or ability to counter most of the status effects you'll encounter. Dispel Magic is absolutely essential as is getting your saving throws as low as you can.  Here's a short list of classes you can use to counter most of the mechanics that are probably giving you fits.  Paladins: Paladins have insanely good saving throws. Inquisitors also get access to a double powered dispel magic that will counter most status effects. Cavaliers and Undead Hunters while not as broken as Inquisitors get some helpful resistances and get those same ridiculous saving throws and access to some good offhealing. Paladins can be effective both DWing or using 2handers; I wouldn't recommend a shield for noncaster/nonthief classes. Keldorn is easily one of if not the best companion you can get.  Berserkers: As stated enrage is insanely good, it negates most of the status effects in the game while giving you solid bonuses to damage and survivability. They don't match the raw damage output of kensai's but they can still pour on damage and are much better defensively. They are also excellent for dual-classing. Berserker->Cleric is one of the best combinations in the game but they are also good mages. My first solo playthrough in BGII was a Berserker->Mage.  Clerics: Clerics and paladins have a ton of invaluable buff spells. Prebuffing is invaluable. Just learn which buffs are needed for which encounters. As was mentioned save often. Also note that if you dual class a ranger to a cleric they'll get access to the full spell book for both clerics and druids.  Thieves: Traps, traps literally break the game. You can instawin any encounter where an enemy starts out neutral or friendly simply by dumping all your traps around them and initiating combat. This is makes most of the dragons stupidly easy to kill. You can also just lay all your traps and get your enemies to chase you into them.  Mages: There is no end to the number of defensive spells mages have access to. Also spells that remove your enemies protections are vital. Dispel Magic is once again invaluable. Chromatic Orb is a seemingly unimposing spell on first glance that can be insanely powerful. Hold and charm spells are also very effective. What you want to look for in offensive spells are one of two things. 1) Damage spells that still do damage on a successful save or 2) Status effects that incur a penalty to your enemies saving throws.  A note on countering casters: As was mentioned insect swarm is busted against mages. Most mages early on rely way too heavily on stoneskin. Elemental damage bypasses stoneskin so if you have a weapon that does bonus elemental damage, i.e. +1 fire damage, you can completely lock mages out of casting. Your weapon won't do any base damage on hit but that 1 fire damage will interrupt all their spells. There are plenty of decent weapons that do elemental damage and few great ones. If you can brave the first few levels of Watcher's Keep you can get the unupgraded versions of angurvadal and spectral brand, which aside from being excellent weapons in their own right will absolutely demolish the majority of the casters in SoA."

I'll also check out the gamefaqs spellguide, perhaps I'll finally understand Chromatic Orb. While I see that disables are invaluable, I can't cast enough Hold fast enough to hit the enemy masses, even 5 mercenaries are enough to cause chaos; and AoE stuff like Entangle hits me as well, so I'm a little flustered. That's a cool bit about Stoneskin though. I'll give Yoshimo an elemental damage weapon, because I usually Boots of the Cheetah him around to the mage and start chopping."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Plugawy_Nedznik,2,Mon Jul 6 12:55:15 2015 UTC,"Google baldurs gate spell reference, it describes and rates ever spell on the game, I found it very useful. Against enemy mages you generally just want two spells, breach and true sight, breach removes things that protect from attacks like stoneskin and protection from magical weapons, true sight removes illusions such as invisibility, mislead and mirror image, cast both and you can just attack the mages, taking damage interrupts casting so that's an easy kill. Against undead you want the 7th level cleric spell sunray, massive damage with instant kill on a failed save, a sword called day star gives the wielder one cast of it each day/rest, this works on liches. Oh if you meet a guy called kangaxx I suggest you look him up before doing the little quest as it involves a unique enemy called a demilich which takes a rather specific strategy to beat."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,gangler52,4,Mon Jul 6 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Difficulty setting  If you’re playing on the easiest difficulty remember that there is no permanent death, so don’t worry about party members dying as you can simply resurrect them with a rod from the shop or Jaheira’s ability after the battle (...or travel back to a temple if things really went to shit).  If you aren’t playing on novice you definitely should as you’d be cheating yourself out of the enjoyment of the game otherwise.   Party composition  Another thing affecting the difficulty is your party composition as you’ve chosen a hard one. Pure mages and pure thieves are difficult to use effectively for a beginner and very tedious to boot. You noticed it yourself with Neera, and as you haven’t invested much into her yet you can benefit from switching her out for someone else.  Pure mages do get a lot of crazy good spells later on but it is a more difficult route for sure.  A play through with next to zero micromanagement requires a party consisting of mostly fighters/archers (including Keldorn) and appropriate scripts for them.   Enemy mages  Against enemy mages you have the perfect counter: Keldorn.  The dispel magic he has in his ability slot is actually MUCH stronger than the normal version that Jaheira and Neera has and it’ll make short work of most mages defenses AS WELL AS remove most debuffs (and buffs…) from your own party members. And when the mages decide to chicken out with some kind of illusion spell just slap on his true sight ability and it’s game over for them.   Healing and resting  About the tediousness of using healing spells I would recommend putting on the option of using ""healing on rest"" and it’ll be done automatically. And you should definitely rest frequently to keep all of your powerful abilities fresh. This also lets you spam every spell you wish in any given encounter and to buff up beforehand.   Usables  And lastly, do not let your usables collect dust in your inventory. If the fight is tough use up those potions of defense/invulnerability/giant strength etc. Usables in this game are crazy strong and can be found everywhere.   Good luck!"
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've learned that Keldorn is awesome, he does everything melee, range, fights magic and is immune to certain immobilizes! He shouldn't be that angry about the shadow thieves though. I guess I expected more survivability from Bards and Thieves. Even Minsc and Jaheira look weak. I'll look out for another fighter type to join the fray; and rest more frequently. I don't like (non healing) potions, never did. The feeling of a not-permanent solution doesn't sit well with me."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,gangler52,0,Mon Jul 6 12:43:34 2015 UTC,"Minsc and Jaheira are weak. Jaheira is a druid, so the best armor she can wear(and still be able to cast spells) is Leather Armor, which is worse than a Thief(who can at least get Studded Leather). Absolutely someone who should be in the back with a sling.  Minsc is just... bad. Everything about him is bad. It's honest to god worst NPC in Baldur's Gate 2. His DEX is bad, so he has no AC, a problem further compounded by his training into two-handed weapons, which means no shield. His CON is bad, so he has crap HP, so not only he'll be getting hit more, he can't take it. He's a Ranger, which means he can't go past Specialization with weapons. And did I mention that his Druid spells from Ranger class are bad because he has no Wisdom? And did I mention that one of his quick slots is permanently occupied? And did I mention that the best two-handed sword in the game is for Paladins only? And... well, you get the idea.  Bards and Thieves are absolutely not first line fighters, with kit exceptions(Blades with Defensive Spin and Swashbucklers) that I assume you don't have."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,Plugawy_Nedznik,2,Tue Jul 7 09:24:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so a few things to take apart here.  Jaheira is a druid multiclass, but that doesn't share the armor limitation of the mage multiclasses. She can cast in full plate just fine.  With the exception of the Avenger Kit, druids can wear studded leather. So in a hypothetical situation where they did have that limitation they Jaheira still wouldn't be worse off than a thief.  Minsc has 16 Dex and 16 Con, both relatively high. Just two points short of the literal maximum for his species, so quite respectable.  Ranger's spells aren't reliant on wisdom. Higher or lower makes no difference to them.  Minsc is trained in 2 handed Swords, but also maces. Axes too if you recruit him at a high enough level. You're free to give him a shield if you're so inclined."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,TTL4k,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:05:08 2015 UTC,"Jaheira is a druid multiclass, but that doesn't share the armor limitation of the mage multiclasses. She can cast in full plate just fine.   So I assume that is an engine limitation which treats Druids as Clerics?   Ranger's spells aren't reliant on wisdom.   They don't get bonus spells for Wisdom?"
baldursgate,3c8ax0,haerdalisdo,2,Tue Jul 7 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"Druids do work similarly to clerics. The multiclass the limitation they bring to the table is their weapon set. The description of the multiclass says nothing about any armor limitations, so this was likely intended. I don't personally know enough to say if there could be any technical reasons behind this.  Rangers don't get bonus spells for wisdom. Paladins don't either. That's strictly clerics and druids."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,gangler52,2,Tue Jul 7 12:54:38 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected, then."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,haerdalisdo,3,Tue Jul 7 12:55:33 2015 UTC,"I have come to learn that if you are playing on core rules or above you simply need to have your mages/clerics pre buff your front line guys and archers before every room or every big fight.  If you know there are mobs behind the next corner, Don't be lazy. BUFF em up.  But everything else in your post? It seems this game might not be for you.  I love micromanaging, I don't set my characters up with scripts. I babysit them, I pause during every fight and maximize every little detail.  I find Min maxing fun so shrugs."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,haerdalisdo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"My original post perhaps expresses a wrong opinion on min-maxing. I'm not against it, I can enjoy it; but only if it seems to help. Upping my chance of survival from 0% to 30%. It looked like I was doing something wrong and buffing like you suggested is perhaps a/the solution."
baldursgate,3c8ax0,dearmrfrodo,2,Mon Jul 6 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you aren't sure what to do with a mage put them on buff/dispel.  Fill them with buffs they can use to make everyone else stronger like haste, and remove magics so they can get rid of any pesky defenses holding you back."
baldursgate,3c7m85,AdonisChrist,5,Sun Jul 5 17:25:20 2015 UTC,"Before speaking to Prelate Wesselen and after being summoned to the Order of the Most Radiant Heart, delete the variable SPRITE_IS_DEADSAERK. Anomen should then be accepted into the Order.  KillSaerk is another variable that might need editing. I'm guessing that ≥ 1 is murdered, and 0 = not murdered.

baldursgate,3c7m85,Triksain,3,Sun Jul 5 20:12:16 2015 UTC,I'd suggest looking at the variables of the save with keeper and check if there's one that seems to be depending on wether or not he killed the guy.
baldursgate,3c7m85,Arabellah16,2,Sun Jul 5 18:03:54 2015 UTC,Yep! I was able to get him knighted by tweaking a few global variables! Even though I'd already saved after he'd been cast out!
