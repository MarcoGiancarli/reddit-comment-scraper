JRPG,3e3dss,samuraigaiden,12,Tue Jul 21 17:25:25 2015 UTC,So Southpark is the 2nd most owned JRPG ? this doesn't seem very accurate.
JRPG,3e3dss,Cynoid,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:38:07 2015 UTC,Lol it's not even a JRPG!
JRPG,3e3dss,chb3320,9,Tue Jul 21 20:20:23 2015 UTC,JRPG has more to do with style than country of origin IMO. Kind of how you can write classical music in modern times. As an example I'd say DarkSouls isn't a JRPG and SouthPark is.
JRPG,3e3dss,rglitched,6,Tue Jul 21 23:26:36 2015 UTC,"What do you mean style? There's so many different types of jrpgs... You have action jrpgs, turn-based jrpgs, strategic jrpgs, isometric jrpgs, jrpgs with plataformer elements... You know the one and only thing they all have in commong? Being made in freaking japan... That's all... They have different themes, different tones, different art styles... How the hell can you say that jrpg is more about style when there's so many jrpgs with completely different styles?  It's silly to consider South Park as an jrpg just because of a freaking turn-based system..."
JRPG,3e3dss,phillippus,5,Wed Jul 22 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"It's silly to consider South Park as an jrpg just because of a freaking turn-based system...   Agree to disagree. JRPGs have a clear style and SouthPark not only fits, but it obviously and clearly fits."
JRPG,3e3dss,rglitched,7,Wed Jul 22 02:22:46 2015 UTC,I'd say South Park should be considered a JRPG. It's pretty much a South Park-skinned Paper Mario game.

Maybe Resident Evil 5 if you take the extreme negative margin of error and compaire it to the extreme positive margin of error of Valkyria Chronicles.

JRPG,3e3dss,THelfrich,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, most of these games came to PC a looong time after their release on consoles. I'm sure FFXIII would have sold a lot more copies had it come out sooner."

Dragons crown had a few rpg elements but does Odin sphere?   i can't speak for muramasa, but while dragon's crown is really plot-light, odin sphere has a lengthy, meaty, linear story. i would say that's the dividing line between JRPG and 2D brawler."
JRPG,3e18in,Choubugioxkei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:49:25 2015 UTC,"Oh the story does seem long you're right.  Though I wouldn't say having a leangthly meaty linear story is what defines it as a JRPG, its mechanics much more so, which on this game I can't say much for, Muramasa was rather plot light, i mean it had a lot of cutscenes but it was mainly hack and a slash honestly."

(doesn't give me much hope for the teased game, but hope springs eternal.)  i won't deny mechanics have something to do with it--the dividing line between paper mario 1&2 and super paper mario is mechanical, rather than narrative--but narrative ""importance"" has something to do with it, too--the dividing line between legend of mana and megaman x."
JRPG,3e18in,Choubugioxkei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:31 2015 UTC,"Muaramas is a strange one eitherway honestly, its steeped in Japanese history, if you know a lot about that period, the people mentioned and so on then you'll get a lot out of it, if you know nothing and only learn it from the game, then you're really scratching the surface. I really enjoyed the game but its not one I'd highly recommend to many others.  Eitherway I plan to buy this, I enjoyed their past games and if this is more story heavy then its what I've been hoping for all this time."
JRPG,3e18in,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'd call Curse of the Sinistrals a JRPG, that also heavily relied on hacking and slashing."
JRPG,3e18in,magmafanatic,2,Tue Jul 21 22:41:04 2015 UTC,I'd class it as a hybrid of a dungeon brawler and JRPG. Each battle plays out kind of the same way an encounter does in a JRPG but the combat is like a brawler that requires a ton of strategy.  It's been a few years since I played it so I'm a little hazy on details but I strongly recommend it to any JRPG fan. It's got enough plot and in-depth gameplay mechanics to satisfy any fan of the genre.

JRPG,3e39zh,SonicRicky,10,Tue Jul 21 16:59:57 2015 UTC,JRPGs existed long before the Persona series.  How old is your friend?
JRPG,3e39zh,Cylinsier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"He's 20, almost 21 as am I. I should clarify that he did say that it's only a true JRPG by ""today's standards"". Whatever that means"
JRPG,3e39zh,Cylinsier,4,Tue Jul 21 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wondered.  I don't agree with his definition of what a JRPG is, mostly because I don't think anyone else defines it the way he does.  I'd point to games like Final Fantasy VI being the epitome of JRPGs and I think that is true by today's standards as well as the standards when that game came out.  If Persona is the definition of a JRPG now, what other game would meet the definition?"
JRPG,3e39zh,videogameboss,8,Tue Jul 21 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"i have never heard anyone at all say persona 4 is a ""true"" jrpg and final fantasy isn't, only the opposite really."

Don't get me wrong i do love Persona 3 and to a lesser degree 4 but   the social sim shit is annoying and makes it more of a VN/SocialSim/Jrpg genre mish mash to me."
JRPG,3e39zh,Lisis_M,4,Tue Jul 21 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"my thoughts exactly, thank you!"
JRPG,3e39zh,cvalrik,0,Wed Jul 22 01:50:09 2015 UTC,"The only way this could possibly make even a little sense is if he defines JRPG as an RPG where you play as a Japanese person in a modern setting. Even then it still makes no sense.  He probably wants to define Persona as a ""True"" JRPG as a way to glorify it above other games."
JRPG,3e39zh,auragar,3,Tue Jul 21 20:08:36 2015 UTC,Yah truly the only way it works is how you say it in your first statement. But the latter is probably true. Even I as a huge Persona fan don't say other games aren't what they are just to make another game seem better.
JRPG,3e39zh,magmafanatic,5,Tue Jul 21 20:38:38 2015 UTC,How many Persona flairs do you see on the JRPG sub? Old school Square titles are still very much the definitive JRPGs in the opinion of (most of) the gaming community.  Your friend sounds weird.
JRPG,3e39zh,Holyrapid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"I would say that Persona games are the outliers with their social aspect etc.  But honestly, the only ""true jrpg"" definition is that it is an rpg made by the japanese.

JRPG,3e39zh,auragar,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:04 2015 UTC,That isn't exactly true. A JRPG can be made by a non-Japanese company. Just like a Japanese company can make a non-Japanese RPG.

JRPG,3dxmnx,Hans109,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:32 2015 UTC,What was wrong with the battle system?  It's been a while but I remember it being fun and intuitive.
JRPG,3dxmnx,DrinkyDrank,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"The thing with the battle system is that I liked it when I first played it too. But when I look back, it's what kept me from replaying the game. The main reason for me was that every level was the same mechanically, so things got repetitive fast, and that your strategy didn't really change a whole lot from battle to battle. The only depth to the battle system was getting yourself positioned right. I liked the different skills of the various characters, but some of them were definitely more fun than others. I recall Mercedes in particular being really boring to play as. Run away until you get everything lined up and then use the power shot. Mind you, I don't think the battle system is super terrible, but I do think it's what was holding the game back from being truly great.  The other issue I had with the battle system was technical in nature. The system wasn't optimized very well, so during some battles with a lot of enemies or objects on screen (the worst offender being the underworld boss battle) the FPS would grind to a painful halt. Just getting that fixed would be a blessing. They fixed it for the EU release of the PS2 game, but then they didn't include the fix in the PS3 digital release, which is just silly."

Circular stages are gone, there's new content being added, and the game is getting HD on top of that - so it should make an already good looking game beautiful. Coming out in jan '16 in Japan, no release yet for the west but between Dragon's Crown and the Muramusa vita remake, I would expect it to be coming out here."

I've personally never made it very far into the game because the gameplay simply gets in the way and becomes an immense frustration.

Tri-Ace hasn't ported anything to PC yet, so I wouldn't hold my breath unless SE starts pushing on them to do so. Or allows SE to do so.  E: Wow, I never realised that tri-Ace were helping the team behind FF13-2 and LR. They have a closer relationship with SE than I thought, so I very well can stand corrected on my statement. Only time will tell, I guess."
JRPG,3dy80u,mishugashu,3,Mon Jul 20 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"They certainly have a very close relationship with SE... Which is why, I guess, that most of their JRPG offerings over the last console generation were published by Square starting with their very own Star Ocean 4 (varying opinions of which notwithstanding).  It would be a brilliant move for both parties to give make the Star Ocean PC series a reality. Just showing some proper love for each of the ports would go a long way in the right direction."

JRPG,3dvqit,Callox,12,Sun Jul 19 22:50:59 2015 UTC,"Haha how much time you've got? This stuff is my jam. I'll try write it compellingly so it won't be too boring.  Thousands of years ago Earth had become so polluted it became akin to a desolate wasteland. The reason for this is unknown, lost to history (nuclear war is a possibility). People built a colossal tower as a gargantuan purifying mechanism, yet it would take a very long time to complete and things would get worse before they got better, and eventually the tower was the only clean place in the world to live in. Cancer was going through the populace like the plague before someone figured out a way to link human lives to quartz, a mineral of which vast deposits existed below Basel, via the intermediary of the Basel supercomputer Zenith. This healed people of cancer, but the quality of their personal piece of quartz now determines their lifespan, the maximum being somewhere around a hundred years. As this was similar to a normal human lifespan, it wasn't really an issue unless the person's piece of quartz was to break earlier than it naturally deteriorated. When people's lives were linked to the Basel supercomputer however, something else was lost as well. People were ""cut off"" from the world outside Basel not only geographically but also mentally and spiritually in ways that are left for the player to interpret during the game.   Basel was never intended to be a place for people to live in, its function being a machine that heals the world from pollution. Thus it isn't really a suitable place for habitation, especially for thousands of years. Being both geographically and ""spiritually"" cut off from the outside world people forgot it exists. When they gaze out from Basel they don't ""see"" the world outside it. Who built Basel and for what purpose becomes enshrouded in mystery, and many come to believe Basel was built by God himself as a haven for His people. Because the builders of Basel are long gone, no one in current times knows what Basel is even for, or how to maintain or fix it. It thus deteriorates in a rapid pace, many areas malfunctioning entirely, the lower levels deteriorating faster than upper levels. Yet, when Basel was built it was known it would take for a very long time to purify the world, and thus it was intended to operate autonomously for thousands of years without need of human input, ""looked over"" eternally by the supercomputer Zenith, and thus the gears keep moving. People live among its tiers none the wiser, as knowledge of what existed before Basel slips ever further from consciousness. Some traditions remain, such as Christmas, though its link to Christianity is lost.   Twenty years ago Frieda was the Prelate of Basel with Cardinal Rowen as her right-hand-man. She reunited Basel under her will to free its people from suffering. It was at first time of hope and peace, and Rowen especially was enamoured with her (possibly being her lover). However, as the lower level people dug deeper into the Basel's base in search of rubies (used as currency in Basel) and other riches they came across a quartz vein and, not understanding its purpose, dug further. Unprecedented cases of ""spontaneous instant death syndrome"" happened all around Basel as the miners dug through the quartz deposit. Unable to explain the phenomenon people turned to religion, believing the spontaneous death to be a message from God. People became hyper religious, yet it seemed God would not answer their prayers, and eventually Frieda herself succumbed to the spontaneous instant death syndrome, her body becoming entombed in Basilica.  Sullivan and Juris were two men who lived in the lower levels of Basel. Unlike most people, they studied the tower trying to discern its purpose. Sullivan especially was a genius in this regard. Some people say that if you could reverse engineer Basel you could perform miracles. The duo's expertise on Basel sent them ""flying through the ranks"" and in a rare case of upward mobility in Basel they came to work in Chandelier.   After Frieda died Sullivan showed Rowen, who was the next in line to be the Prelate, Zenith at the top of Basel and explained the reason Frieda and the other victims had died. Rowen was crestfallen and his belief in God was shaken. Himself, and Frieda, and all the other people had been devout followers of God, yet this machine is the one that coldly decides the time a man's time is up? This machine is what people had been praying to for respite from the death plague? Rowen wanted to believe there being something ""more"" to life, some higher power, and that there really is a God who looks after people with a bigger plan, but this revelation shattered it. Though Rowen never took up the rank of Prelate, he became Basel's de facto ruler. As the first order of business he banned all mining expeditions and the miners who knew about the quartz vein were given massive sums of hush money. The miners took the rare chance at upward mobility in society and moved out of the lower levels never to be seen again by their previous peers. The lower level inhabitants were furious, as to them it seemed Chandelier had just denied them their main source of income out of seemingly no other reason than to keep them poor. As the mining stopped, so did the cases of spontaneous death.   The unity Frieda had cultivated between the Cardinals was lost. Each Cardinal had their own idea on how to better  Basel, and started working on their private projects. Cardinal Theresa is the most ""down to earth"" Cardinal who wants to help the people through charity, and organizes events like soup kitchen in the lower levels, and gift giving to all children in Christmas. Cardinal Antourion retreated from society and buries himself in research, his goal to find an answer to mankind's predicament this way. Cardinal Garligiano lost touch with the people's suffering and dedicates his life in creating art, to find ""meaning"" this way."
JRPG,3dvqit,satsumaclementine,7,Mon Jul 20 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"What about Rowen, the leader of Basel who lost his faith? He wants to honour Frieda's wish to free the people from suffering, and thus wants to gain the means of controlling Zenith. Though he has largely lost his faith...there is a piece in the Scriptures that keeps nagging at him. Resurrection. Could Frieda come back? If they found a way to control Zenith? He doesn't dare believe it. Rowen was never a scientist, however, but what about those Sullivan and Juris?  Wanting to study how human lives are linked to quartz, Sullivan and Juris set up a secret experiment in Aldersyde high up in Chandelier with financing from Rowen. Sullivan had figured out a way to locate specific pieces of quartz based on the individual's date of birth. Twenty orphans born on Christmas Day were taken to the facility, and their pieces of quartz were programmed to shatter at predetermined dates, one a year. Juris was the one who looked after the children. Every Christmas one kid ""moved out"" of the facility, or so was told to the ones who remained. Leanne is experiment #20. She eagerly awaited the day she would be released from the facility and planned for all the things she would do once that day arrived. Every Christmas she wished she would be chosen to ""leave"". One day, Leanne got ill and was on the verge of death. Sullivan came to see her, and determined she was not well off. Subject #20 dying early could mess up the experiment, and he ordered the scientists at the lab to do whatever they could to save her. A scientist placed something in Leanne's hand. She recovered.  Cardinal Lagerfeld is a strict man of religion. He wants to follow the late Prelate's ideal of freeing mankind from suffering by the strict following of the Scriptures. It was easy to find followers to this more fundamental side of thinking in the wake of the ""spontaneous instant death syndrome"", as people were terrified and desperately turned to God. He set up the Crank Seminar where orphans would be raised as devout followers of God to become the role models of everyone in Basel in due time, and in time everyone would follow the Scriptures to the tee and mankind would be saved and God would finally listen and save the world. Not everyone was as optimistic, however. The lower level inhabitants, still sour Chandelier banned mining, viewed it as yet another scheme for Chandelier to oppress people.   What nobody knew, was that the people who live in Basel, are not the only people in the world.   Long ago when the first people moved to Basel and became linked to Zenith via the intermediary of quartz, there were people who were left outside. Most died, but some mutated, entering the ""second stage of evolution"". They became immune to cancer, and their cell regeneration became so good they could live exceptionally long lives, and perhaps even become biologically immortal.   The young Vashyron was in the army serving under General Victor, Cardinal Theresa's husband. One day, there was a disaster in Lucia and Victor and his men were sent to deal with it without anyone telling them what to expect. General Gelsey was upset Victor was chosen to lead the mission and not him, and developed a grudge against the Cardinals, especially when the truth of the happenings at Lucia was never released to the public. All that is known is that everyone died but one man: Vashyron. What Victor and Vashyron and the others had met in Lucia was Rebecca, a mysterious girl with incredible powers who hated Basel and everything it stood for, and had attacked the town of Lucia. Vashyron was the last man standing and as Rebecca tried to kill him, something unexpected happened: As she thrust her hand through Vashyron's chest a mysterious sign knocked her out cold. Vashyron escaped the incident unharmed with a shocked Sullivan following the events from the shadows. While Vashyron went home and quit the army to become a hunter, unable to make sense of what had happened seeing that he didn't believe in God or miracles, Sullivan secretly took Rebecca home with him and had the incident covered up. After all, with Vashyron as the only eyewitness, keeping one man silent was not too difficult a task seeing Vashyron didn't want anything to do with the whole thing.   Sullivan realized Rebecca is from outside Basel, and thus a true ""man of God"", as she is free of Zenith. The contact with the sacred sign has made Rebecca mentally retarded, and mostly harmless. Sullivan lets her drink his blood, and studies her in secret. And thus started the second strain of research into Zenith's workings, one best kept secret from Rowen. Sullivan realized Rebecca's cell regeneration is so good she is practically immortal, and throughout the years she stays with him, she never seems to age.    Subject #19 ""moved out"" of Aldersyde and only Leanne remained. During a tea break with Juris she lamented still having to wait a year before her turn. Juris suddenly declared she can leave today and hurried her to the gates. Leanne was excited, and promised to come meet him on her next birthday. They ran into Rowen and Leanne wished him Merry Christmas. Rowen was furious Juris was going to release Leanne early but Juris pleaded they had enough data and that Leanne should be allowed to live the last year of her life. Remembering words from Frieda, of how she had wanted to give people freedom, Rowen relented and Leanne was shoved out the door. In the hassle, she had stolen Juris's notebook. Bewildered Juris had called it ""the last year of her life"" she read it, and discovered the other subjects had not moved out, they had all died, and her time would come in exactly one year.   Zephyr was an orphan living in the Crank Seminar, but things were not going well with him. He did not fit in with the oppressing ""brain washing"" atmosphere and struggled to believe in an all-knowing benevolent God seeing how much suffering there was in the world. He clashed with Lagerfeld for not being devout enough. He had befriended a younger girl who tried to make Zephyr a devout and teach him about God, but Zephyr never even opened the Book of Scriptures she had given him. And one day he snapped. He brought a gun to school and the most horrific school shooting event Basel's history took place. If God is all powerful, surely God would stop him? Or if God let him kill his classmates, then this was part of God's ""big plan""? Zephyr defied the teachings and asked for God to intervene and show He really exists, but alas, no divine intervention came to stop him.    Vashyron had become a legend among the Cardinals, being the only survivor of the Lucia incident, and thus he is privy to some exclusive jobs with the Cardinals other hunters rarely get a chance at. Lagerfeld hired him to kill Zephyr, who remained in a manic state at the Crank Seminary after having shot his classmates. Vashyron overpowered Zephyr in a gun fight and shot him twice in the head. But he didn't die, and the sacred sign appeared on the Statue of God Vashyron had pinned Zephyr's head against. Vashyron recognized it as the same thing as what had happened to him, and refused to try and kill Zephyr again despite Lagerfeld's insistences. Vashyron took Zephyr to Ebel City to live with him, while Lagerfeld must accept that for an unfathomable reason God has saved Zephyr with a divine miracle. The Crank Seminary project was dropped, people coming up with various interpretations of what happened. Some believe a boy was possessed by the devil, but some lower level inhabitants hail him a hero and started a cult around him, viewing him a role model who fought Chandelier's oppression. Vashyron gained even more notoriety as the hunter who killed the ""boy possessed by the devil""."
JRPG,3dvqit,satsumaclementine,5,Mon Jul 20 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Vashyron and Zephyr lived for a year in Ebel City, Vashyron giving him a room in the attic, although Zephyr has no belongings other than the Book of Scriptures he still refuses to open yet never throws away. Neither can make sense of what happened to them, but try to make the best of it, though Zephyr battles depression. He has suicidal thoughts, but fears he would be unable to die if he tried, and thus never tries to commit suicide. He feels he has little reason to live, however, and not being afraid of death makes him put his life in a harm's way easily. This trait came to use on Christmas Day a year after moving in with Vashyron...  Christmas Day, her 20th birthday, the day she was to die, Leanne went to the top of Chandelier her plan to commit suicide to have this last shred of agency in deciding her fate. She jumped, but Zephyr caught her midair and both fell off the edge. The bells tolled to midnight, the lights of Zenith flashed with the symbol of the sacred sign at the top of Basilica, and Leanne didn't die. Later Zephyr reminisces he saw a strange symbol on the ground where they fell. Zephyr took Leanne to Ebel City to live with them and join their hunter group.  Sullivan is selling out people's pieces of quartz behind Rowen's back to fund his secret research into Rebecca and has Vashyron deliver them. Only someone wealthy like a Cardinal can afford it. After Vashyron collects Cardinal Pater's quartz from the abandoned Cafe Chelsey, Sullivan lets Rebecca play in the ruins. She grasps something invisible from the air while Sullivan watches. He is holding another piece of quartz in his hand.  Vashyron, Zephyr and Leanne deliver the piece of quartz to Pater. Pater's father has recently passed away, and was the one keen on finding his son's piece, so he probably knew about its significance. Pater, having inherited the rank of Cardinal, only associates it with the story of finding one's star from heavens bringing one eternal good luck. As he turns the quartz into a light his eyes shine blue, proving the piece is his. Pater takes a liking to Leanne and starts hanging out at Ebel City but is always too shy to talk to her, although he befriends Zephyr. Pater's idea on how to improve the populace's lives is to rebuild Paterpolis that collapsed during the ""instant spontaneous death syndrome"" epidemic. He is part of the new generation of Cardinals alongside Cardinal Jean Paulet, Cardinal Barbarilla and Cardinal Veronique, who never served under Frieda. Jean Paulet is happy being the ""Justin Bieber"" of Basel, who, while greatly loved as an ""idol"", is out of touch with the people's struggles and thinks he can help by commissioning an (ugly) statue to be placed in the Forest of Idols as a symbol of hope to people. Veronique is the only truly religious Cardinal, her faith to the True God unshaken. She spends long days praying for Rowen, who has become clinically depressed and an alcoholic. Rowen mourns the deaths of the 20 orphans, the experiment he had funded, and drowns his sorrows with the bottle and rarely appears in public.    On Prelate Frieda's day Theresa tasks Vashyron with delivering a silk rose to Lucia to where Victor and the other men died. She is shocked to see Zephyr with Vashyron, and to hear Zephyr had saved Leanne. During a blackout Vashyron's team fixes a power generator. To get more work from the ""Elder Cardinals"" and climb the social ladder, Vashyron dresses Leanne up to inspire Garligiano to create a statue on her, which is later commissioned by Jean Paulet to be put on display to ""raise the morale of the poor"" although everyone ends up thinking the statue is hideous. While delivering the statue to the Forest of Idols they spot flower petals flying in the air. Leanne ponders where they come from and Vashyron reminds her there is a world outside Basel. Leanne gets ill and hallucinates of the time she was ill in Aldersyde when a scientist saved her by putting something in her hand, and of the time she left the facility, but Zephyr and Vashyron deliver her medicine.   Gelsey, the army officer holding a grudge over the Cardinals having chosen Victor over him, breaks into the quartz mines to find out what the Cardinals are hiding in there. Wanting to keep the area a secret from general public Sullivan sends Vashyron's group to deal with it instead of the army. After Gelsey is killed Sullivan arrives and is shocked Leanne is with Vashyron, but Leanne doesn't recognize Sullivan because it was Juris who looked after the orphans. Sullivan is dumbfounded Leanne is not dead, and asks Vashyron to take good care of her.  This poses a problem for Sullivan, however. Were Rowen to discover Leanne is alive he would discover Zenith cannot be controlled, and would think the experiment with the 20 orphans was in vain, jeopardising Sullivan's coveted position. Sullivan expedites the project and asks Rowen to provide something to work as the key to control Zenith, and Rowen gives his ring, given to him by Frieda. Sullivan knows Rowen views him as expendable, and that if he really got the means to control Zenith he would get rid of Sullivan, no longer needing him and now viewing him a threat for the inside knowledge he has. Sullivan eventually procures the ring and tells Rowen he can control Zenith and provokes him by talking about resurrection, claiming it is possible. Sullivan needs to keep manipulating Rowen so he would believe controlling Zenith is the only way to reach his goals, whereas Sullivan knows otherwise with his secret research with Rebecca. Sullivan had told Rowen before that it would be imperative for the two of them to locate their personal pieces of quartz and keep them safe."
JRPG,3dvqit,satsumaclementine,6,Mon Jul 20 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"Pater summons the courage to ask Leanne out for a date but during it his piece of quartz he now always holds on his person shatters and he dies. Paterpolis project is abandoned. Cardinal Antourion tasks Vashyron to look for the sacred sign from Lucia, as his research has let him to believe it was the thing that saved Vashyron that day, despite Vashyron insisting he didn't see a sign. Vashyron's party discovers Vashyron's old gun but not much else. The sight of it triggers a flashback where Vashyron remembers confronting Rebecca, and remembers the ""sign"" appeared on her when she thrust her hand through his chest. He starts to laugh, realizing it is impossible to find the sign if it was on Rebecca, but what is he supposed to tell Antourion?     On the day of the school shooting Vashyron delivers a flower to Crank Seminary and Leanne accompanies him, discovering Zephyr was the culprit, greatly upsetting her. Lagerfeld, who hasn't had much meaning in his life after the Crank Seminary project fell apart loses his faith in God and decides to settle the matters and kill Zephyr. He calls Zephyr out to the Rainy Bridge and during their confrontation reveals that if Zephyr had even tried and given God a chance and opened the Book of Scriptures he would have learned he had a sister. Zephyr gives up but Leanne shoots Lagerfeld and admonishes Zephyr for being willing to die so easily. Ever since saving Leanne Zephyr has made her his reason for living, but can't shake the suicidal thoughts, unable to understand why he is still alive when all the people around them are dying, him surely being the least deserving of anyone. Zephyr opens up to Vashyron of his plan to commit suicide once he has made sure Leanne will be happy.   Jean Paulet gets married in secret hiring Zephyr and Leanne as decoys for a fake wedding while Paulet's bride's ex boyfriend hires Vashyron to stop it. Hilarity ensues. Christmas is coming and Pater was meant to be this year's Santa, but seeing he passed away Theresa asks Vashyron's party, knowing Pater had taken a liking to Leanne and would probably be happy if she took up the role in his stead. After the gift giving Theresa invites the three to the mass in Basilica where Leanne passes by Rowen and wishes him Merry Christmas mirroring the event from two years ago. Rowen recognises Leanne as Subject #20 and is shocked. Either Sullivan has been lying to him about the experiment with the 20 orphans and gaining control of Zenith, or a miracle has happened and resurrection is real. He sets out to confront Sullivan and sends his men to raid Aldersyde, but Sullivan is one step ahead. He tells Juris to leave, but the latter refuses, not seeing the point as he doesn't have much to live for now that the experiment is over. Rowen's men ransack Aldersyde but as they can't find Sullivan they depart.  Meeting Rowen has reminded Leanne of Juris and her childhood and how she promised to go see him on her birthday and departs to Aldersyde where she meets Juris and he comes back to Ebel City with her. He is shocked Leanne is alive but cannot explain how. He theorises Leanne's piece of quartz was swapped by Sullivan, though he cannot fathom why Sullivan would do that. Zephyr is upset Leanne's quartz is in the hands of some mad scientist and urges they go confront him.   Sullivan is at his residence at the Outer Wall of Chandelier and he releases Rebecca to the wild. He gives her a piece of quartz and tells her to destroy it if he fails to join her in time. As Rebecca leaves Basel Vashyron's party shows up demanding for Leanne's quartz but Sullivan claims he has organized to have it destroyed should something happen to him. Rowen, who also pursues Sullivan, arrives and overhears. He demands to know why Subject #20 is standing before them alive and well, and Sullivan claims miracles are part of the system, Leanne's survival doesn't mean the experiment was futile. Rowen demands to see a miracle with his own eyes so that he could believe in God, and shoots Sullivan. Vashyron confirms he is dead. With Sullivan dead, Leanne should die soon after. In Rowen's mind, if she does not die, surely Leanne is immortal and God's Chosen. Fighting through Rowen's ranks the party flees.   Leanne wants to go talk to Rowen one last time. She has accepted her impending death; her wish came true after all, to live her life like she wanted. She deems the year she had was enough. Before she dies she wants to ask Rowen something. Zephyr is beside himself, as Leanne is his only reason for living. Cardinals Antourion and Garligiano defend Rowen as per their promise made to Frieda, but fall to the party. They meet Rowen in Basilica and Leanne asks if he regrets anything. Rowen doesn't and Leanne is satisfied. Zephyr isn't, and draws his gun and shoots Rowen. The bullet passes through his body into the painting of Prelate Frieda at the back that begins to shine with the sacred sign. Zephyr is infuriated but Vashyron leads his team out, and they again ponder about there being a world outside Basel.  Rowen has had the proof of a miracle he was looking for and his faith in the True God, not Zenith, is restored. He leaves the ring on Frieda's tomb to signify he has given up on trying to control Zenith. Whether the appearance of the sacred sign that saves a person from a sure death is just a glitch in Zenith's programming or a real miracle, no longer matters to him. Antourion and Garligiano also rise, the symbol of the sacred sign burning under their bodies as flower petals rain all around Basel, Cardinal Veronique who had been praying spotting them as well as Juris back in Ebel City.   Outside Basel Rebecca awaits for Sullivan who never shows and thus destroys the quartz in her possession. Sullivan finds her and sees the flower petals swirling in the air. He realises the petals were what Rebecca was grasping when she was playing in the abandoned Cafe Chelsey during the time they delivered Pater's quartz to Vashyron, and says ""Now I see what you see."" Rebecca, who has been unable to speak ever since the incident with the sacred sign, musters a word, ""Sullivan"", an embraces him. Further outside Basel in a world purified of pollution Vashyron, Zephyr and Leanne explore the land. Leanne raises her hand to the sun and a blue stone shines through it and her eyes turn blue, like Pater's did when he confirmed the veracity of his piece of quartz. The unknown scientist had put Leanne's piece in her hand, literally ""putting her life in her own hands"", and the piece Sullivan had was never hers."
JRPG,3dvqit,satsumaclementine,6,Mon Jul 20 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"MY ""FAN THEORY"" ON THE ENDING  The piece of quartz Sullivan had since the beginning was his own. When he told Rowen they should work to find their own pieces of quartz, he had already located his own a long time ago. Sullivan had reversed its effect. He knew he could not leave Basel because he ""couldn't see the world outside"", being linked to Zenith. Therefore, he arranged to have himself killed, and when Rebecca destroyed the piece of quartz it revived him and freed him, and all the other people of Basel alongside him, from Zenith. That's why people in the ending can see the flower petals. People leave Basel and discover the world has been restored. The name ""Rebecca"" means ""connection"" and when she embraces Sullivan in the ruins outside Basel, the two ""strands"" of mankind are reunited.  Sullivan is the ""second coming of Jesus"" either literally or allegorically. Rebecca drinking his blood alludes to communion ritual. Him dying and being resurrected frees the people of Basel and from Zenith. Whether God really exists is up for the player to decide."
JRPG,3dvqit,satsumaclementine,4,Mon Jul 20 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"Well...Shit. How did you suss all this out? Are you a big fan of the plot? I feel like even if I was, I'd have to take notes to retain all of the information you did."

JRPG,3dvqit,Sighto,2,Mon Jul 20 14:08:48 2015 UTC,"Great overview! There was a lot I missed my first playthrough, but I absolutely adored this game's non-traditional storytelling."
JRPG,3dvqit,avdale,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for writing this out. I played Resonance of Fate years ago and enjoyed the combat but the story was completely indecipherable. This makes a bit more sense but I still don't get why Rowen didn't die when Zephyr shot him? Is the sacred sign meant to mean that god really does exist and all the religion is real or what?
JRPG,3dvqit,satsumaclementine,3,Mon Jul 20 11:15:19 2015 UTC,"It is meant to be a mystery. Either it is a glitch in Zenith and happens randomly and people pointlessly attach meaning to it, or it is an intended feature of Zenith to start ""releasing"" people from it after a certain amount of time (perhaps after it is estimated the world is habitable again). Whoever built Zenith is not around any longer to answer whether the ""sacred sign"" feature is intended. OR it could be of divine origin. Rowen wants to believe it is and that is good enough for him. Sullivan believes it is done by Zenith and that ""miracles are an intended part of the system"" and if he can reverse engineer Zenith then he can gain the power to perform miracles as well. Vashyron and friends seem atheist and don't care about either God or Zenith, and seem to take the sacred sign as a random occurrence where they just got lucky.   EDIT: The game's Japanese name is ""End of Eternity"" which sounds like a much better name, but maybe that was already ""taken"" in English and they didn't want to use it, I don't know... So I think it is also possible that in the ending Zenith has just come to the end of its program, deemed the world habitable for humans again and thus releases them. Though Rowen and the others who know about Zenith tend to anthropomorphise it, I don't think Zenith is sentient or has any agenda apart from what what was initially programmed into it.    I think the sacred sign signifies one being released from Zenith. When Rebecca plays at Cafe Chelsey and the scene is from Sullivan's point of view he watches her play with the air. In the Forest of Idols the party spots flower petals and are amazed they can see something that is from outside Basel. In the end everyone sees the petals and Sullivan saying ""I see what you see"" means the petals, as he realizes it was the petals she was playing with at the abandoned cafe, but to him they were invisible.   In Japanese culture falling cherry blossoms symbolise either death or an end of/losing something. Thus their presence in many JRPGs."
JRPG,3dvqit,ndhl83,2,Mon Jul 20 11:37:35 2015 UTC,"THANKS! I bought this game, never played it, and sold it, but was always curious about it. You have satiated my curiosity."
JRPG,3dvqit,zmikeb,4,Tue Jul 21 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Hm I'll take a stab at this, though it's been a few years since I played the game and my memory may or may not be accurate.  Before the start of the game, most of humanity gets cancer and dies out. To combat this, humanity moves into the tower and turns over the management of their lifespans to a supercomputer (Eden maybe? Names escape me at this point) and are basically immortal until the time that the computer has calculated arrives--to paraphrase, human beings are more or less undying except when the computer RNGs their deaths and then it's all over. Hence in the intro video that shootout where nobody dies: they can't. Also relevant is the OTHER intro video with the computer that I never saw until I'd beaten the game; this one sort of links things together so they make sense.  Most of the odd job stuff is trivial (not main plot related) and I barely remember most of it except for the hilarious mission with the jigglies and those helicopter ones near the end.  Eventually it turns into a classic JRPG WE MUST KILL FATE type of thing, and it becomes your job to break humanity ""free"" of the computer that's been managing their lives for however many hundreds of years. Then at the end, you beat up (but can't kill, obviously) that guy who's managing the computer and free yourselves. The game ends with everyone twirling around outside in the purified world outside the tower, free of the shackles of the computer which was keeping them safe.  I'd have to look it up to refresh my memory more, but I think this is roughly the gist of it."

Holy shit, I think that was actually the worst decision in this game storywise was hiding that video (which explains a HUGE portion of what's going on between Rowen and Sullivan) and not playing it as the game's intro vid or something. Seriously.   I really loved the story actually. It reminded me a lot of Cowboy Bebop and the pacing was nice and easy with most of the missions almost never relating to the ""main story."" It's a nice change of pace from usual JRPG ""save the world"" narratives that moves from place to place solving dungeons."

JRPG,3dtqe9,gianttabby,2,Sun Jul 19 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"FFF is perfectly functional. You won't find any game-breaking bugs or glitches that take away from the experience. I should note a few things though, since YMMV.  TL;DR answer: PS3 version is out now, but I recommend getting it if you can tolerate mid-to-high 20's fps. Or you can wait for the PC port, which had a closed beta but has not yet announced a release date aside from this year. It's best enjoyed if you want a not-so-serious and fun story with simple but entertaining gameplay. Objectively it's a flawed game, but subjectively I love it alot.  Okay now for the longer answer. If you want the details about how I feel about this game, then prepare for the wall of text.  If you don't know much about what FFF is, just think of it as Final Fantasy meets Soul Eater. Your JRPG heroes have partners that transform into weapons.  How you enjoy FFF will be up to you and what you're looking for. I've seen games that run worse and the PS3's framerate during dungeon crawling is tolerable for me, especially since combat's fps runs a bit better and is turn-based anyway. I personally love this game because of the combat's flow, presentation, and that you can walk around instead of just standing there. It just feels faster because you can assign attacks are quick to execute and can be edited into combos if you spend enough points. Plus the special attacks look pretty cool, more so than CH's other games. Granted, alot of battles can be simple and a little easy, but I don't play FFF for the difficulty. There's more to enjoy in there than ""how often can I avoid death"". Aside from the battles themselves, I got this sense of progress and reward from the various options for stats and abilities. And there's a Challenge System that rewards your party members with stat boosts for various in-game achievements and milestones.  As for the story itself, well it's nothing revolutionary. Guy finds a magic sword and ends up on a journey to revive the goddess while forming a ragtag band of misfits. But it's my favorite because of the characters and their banter. Our protagonist Fang is a slacker who only pulled the sword out so he can wish for food (certainly relatable at least to me), Tiara's a fancy girl who turns out to be a condescending masochist, etc. I just find all the characters' personalities and dialogue to be entertaining. It's not award-winning or anything. If Lost Odyssey is fine wine, and Final Fantasy XIII is a Mountain Dew bottle filled with leaking holes, then Fairy Fencer F is a chocolate shake with a side of deep fried oreos. And let me tell you, I have a damn sweet tooth.  Speaking of sweet, the graphics aren't very advanced, but Tsunako's art style makes up for it. Especially when you look at the character portraits she illustrated for the cutscenes. If you're cool with the modern-style anime like Tales and Kingdom Hearts, you should be fine with this one. I personally like it the most because I love colorful and cute styles, so Tsunako is obviously one of the most redeeming factors to my experience with the game."

It was an okay mechanic, but it kinda felt out of place and got annoying when you messed up since that would revive the boss.

JRPG,3dn2ux,isual,3,Fri Jul 17 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"Multiple save files alone guarantee I'm picking it up.  I like what little I've played so far. Voice acting could be better, but oh well. As far as gameplay? It's an Etrian Odyssey game. It is what it is and I like it that way."

JRPG,3dm3us,Chrisiztopher,9,Fri Jul 17 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I thought this was a troll post on r/Megaten when I saw it on my front page. Nocturne is used as a standing joke there to make fun of the people who are on the sub only knowing about persona 3 and 4 and no other SMT.   It is a great game, though I don't enjoy it quite as much as the Digital Devil Saga games. They're similar to but easier than nocturne, and the story is amazing, particularly in the second game, so they come highly recommended for those who haven't played them."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,3,Fri Jul 17 12:12:59 2015 UTC,Nocturne is my first Megatron title and I'm having so much trouble with it. Should I double down and get dds1 and 2 and play those first instead?

JRPG,3dm3us,Kenpokid4,3,Fri Jul 17 14:06:36 2015 UTC,Maitre d  Edit. Yes matador. Idk why my phone auto corrected to maitre d
JRPG,3dm3us,cg001,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:42 2015 UTC,"You just need to learn how to utilize the combat system to your advantage which is essential once you get later in the game. Matador primarily uses wind based attacks, so if you make sure that nobody in your party is weak to wind, then you'll be able to prevent him from getting a lot of extra turns. Additionally, if you have somebody in your party who is immune to wind, then any time he uses a wind attack he won't be able to get additional turns as long as one attack is nullified.  Another thing to keep in mind is that buffs and debuffs last for the duration of the entire fight as long as they aren't dispelled or countered with the opposite spell, so you can freely use them against bosses throughout the game and at many times they are essential.  Nocturne isn't that difficult once you know what you're doing, but it is definitely a lot less forgiving than some other SMT games."
JRPG,3dm3us,ITSWAR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:45 2015 UTC,The Matador was added in the special edition of the game (which was the only version released outside of Japan) so that's why he seems (and is) really hard for the area that he's in.
JRPG,3dm3us,HowManyRobot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that battle's notorious for catching people off guard. The first time I played, I had some real trouble with both that and the next 'candelabra is glowing' battle. Both fights are kinda 'baptism by fire' to show the player just how important proper buffs/debuffs/weaknesses/strengths are to succeeding in the game. My worst suffering was a result of me stubbornly refusing to change the main character's magatama parasite. I'm trying to remember if one of those weird twitchy people in the area before Matador warns you about his elemental attacks or if the game just forces the player to get their ass handed to them at least once... Whatever the case may be...yeah, he's a pain in the ass, but the game just gets better and better once you get over that annoying hurdle."
JRPG,3dm3us,ScribbleBliss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:48:05 2015 UTC,Yeah the problem I have is the buffing and debugging. I usually play tales final fantasy and like hyperdimension. So it's hard to get into the buffing mindset.
JRPG,3dm3us,cg001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:04:13 2015 UTC,I had so much trouble with the matador until I realized you can switch Magatama or whatever they're called...beat him first try after that.
JRPG,3dm3us,EpsilonX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"SMT III was the first tough RPG that I'd played after years of playing through games like the PSX/PS2 Final Fantasies, Chrono Trigger, Skies of Arcadia, and the PS2 Suikoden titles...all games that could be enjoyed for their stories/exploration/etc.. without requiring too much careful strategy or experimentation on the player's part. Sure, the FF games would always have their optional mega-bosses and Suikoden games could nudge you to look for all 108 team members, but none of them ever threw one of those things down like a roadblock. SMT III was the first game I'd played in a while in which I'd have long sessions in which I didn't advance the game's plot at all...especially after I was able to start fusing demons and exploring the Labyrinth of Amala."
JRPG,3dm3us,ScribbleBliss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:54:36 2015 UTC,"That happened to me with Persona 3.  Then again, that game makes it a lot easier to play without advancing the story.  I spent SO MUCH time simply fusing demons and doing sidequests and stuff like that.  I'd play all day and never once advance the story - heck, sometimes I wouldn't even make it through one day."
JRPG,3dm3us,EpsilonX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"Nocturne is a tough game, DDS is less so but can still be hard. I'd actually recommend persona 3 or 4 to a complete newbie, then graduate to DDS or SMT4, and only then would I play nocturne.

JRPG,3dm3us,Azal8522,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:11 2015 UTC,SMT4 was almost too easy for me.  About halfway through the game I had it so almost every enemy attack was absorbed/reflected and I could exploit every weakness.  Nobody even stood a chance.

JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to agree with Devil Survivor, simply because the game seems like it's completely dialogue and combat, with nothing else.  Or are all SRPGs like that?  I generally don't play them.  Then again, i'm not that far..."
JRPG,3dm3us,EpsilonX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:23:45 2015 UTC,They're usually like that. Look at fire emblem
JRPG,3dm3us,starlizzle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:46:37 2015 UTC,"Most SRPGs are that plus some mechanic for party and equipment management, which in DeSu are covered by demon auctions/fusion, and collecting skills from demons for your characters respectively, so it's not that atypical of SRPGs to be honest. The main reason for my recommendation though is that it introduces a new Megaten player to fusion and the weird ass skill names in a game that's less insane than nocturne.  I'll add the caviat that I haven't played more than about 10 hours of DeSu either, but I recommend it because it's very commonly recommended for new Megaten players. My personal order was Persona 3, 4, DDS1, DDS2 and SMT4 at the same time, then nocturne, which worked well for me."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:09:22 2015 UTC,"For me, I started with Nocturne but couldn't get past the labyrinth that came right after the Matador (maybe it's because Matador took me so long to beat that I no longer had the ambition to continue on?)  From there, it went P3FES, SMTIV, and now DeSuO.  If most SRPGs are like DeSu, I don't think i'm going to be playing a lot of them.  Are the Disgaea games like that?"
JRPG,3dm3us,EpsilonX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily mean all SRPGs are mechanically the same, but they usually consist of a split between story, combat and character advancement. Disgaea for example has extremely complicated character advancement systems that almost beggar belief, and a goofier story, but still follows the same broad structure.  I feel your pain with Matador, it's famous for being the point where new players break, but once you understand Megaten better, it's not too bad... mostly."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:51 2015 UTC,Well I like being able to explore in rpgs and I feel like I won't get that with an srpg lol

JRPG,3dm3us,SailsofKharon,3,Fri Jul 17 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved DDS1. I tried getting into DDS2, and gave up after hitting a point where the only way to beat one of the story bosses is to use a character I haven't been leveling for the entire game. It was really frustrating, but I think I'm going to go back and give it another shot"
JRPG,3dm3us,not_vulva,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, that sucks. I was warned in advance about that, so it wasn't an issue. In my opinion it is worth it, but I totally get your frustration."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:13 2015 UTC,What character was it by the way?
JRPG,3dm3us,PandaStyle,2,Sat Jul 18 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"I would rather not spoil details, but if he's thinking of the part I'm thinking about, suffice it to say don't let anyone fall too far behind on levels, and especially not Gale. They don't need to be all levelled as high as whoever you're currently using, just so long as they're not 20 levels below or something silly. Towards the endgame it likes to swap party members around a lot, so you just want to ensure no ones more than a dungeon or so behind if you can avoid it.   Oh, and don't prioritise mantra for those you aren't using, that can be expensive, just throw them a bone once certain levels of mantra become trivially inexpensive, since you can catch them up quicker if you need to."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,2,Sat Jul 18 11:50:31 2015 UTC,DDS2 story is a BIIIIIG weak point for me. It kind of throws everything in DDS1 in the trash...
JRPG,3dm3us,no1babbydaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:30:41 2015 UTC,Really? I thought it was good. DDS1 has much stronger world building but I still thought DDS2 was excellent though.
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,3,Fri Jul 17 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"What happens in the final dungeon was a slap in the face, and a lot of what happened when you get there felt rushed. I had SO many questions left, and I just wasn't satisfied. The characters are definitely better and it hits you in the feels more, but I think it lost a lot of the atmosphere and tension from the first game.   Overall, I'd say the biggest problem is that the story between DDS1 and DDS2 are disconnected, ya feel me? It's like they were making an entirely different game story wise and decided ""Hey, maybe we should somehow link this to DDS1"". Still a good game though."
JRPG,3dm3us,no1babbydaddy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:00:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The plot was actually planned from the outset as I understand it, but some details didn't translate well to the game. If you want the more complete story, I'd recommend reading the translation of Quantum Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner. Only the first volumes out and the plot is already far deeper than just the game."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:27:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah DDS has a superior soundtrack and the DDS2 final dungeon is, in my opinion, amazing in every sense. Plus the mantra grid is a nice skill system compared to Nocturne fusion, which can at times be incredibly frustrating when skills just don't transfer."
JRPG,3dm3us,RNGmaster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:11:15 2015 UTC,"I do love the mantra grid, but I think I would have made going into certain branches lock others, since by endgame it felt like there were several trees every character had to know, and it made everyone less unique. Also, since I had Serph spec into magic heavily, particularly in DDS1, it made Argilla and Gale often seem like just a worse version of Serph in a lot of ways. Overall I think it's awesome though, it reminds me of the FF12 system but done more cleanly."
JRPG,3dm3us,AndyF1996,3,Sat Jul 18 11:33:05 2015 UTC,"If setting and character development is what kept you interested, give Strange Journey (DS) a try when you can..  Also, obligatory /r/MegaTen recommendation, as you will surely feel at home in there.."

JRPG,3dm3us,magmafanatic,3,Fri Jul 17 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"Persona 3 and 4 get a lot of love, and I feel like the Devil Survivor games tend to do alright, likely because of the teen-friendly character designs. I wouldn't argue that the other SMT games 'get the shaft', rather that they're just more niche, more old-school, more stolid, more difficult, more mature, and as such, simply won't grab up as many average American gamers who have 'average American JRPG taste' (i.e. the ones who go crazy for every Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, and Pokemon game, yet wouldn't be arsed to try something like Etrian Odyssey). When that lot wants 'mature content', they'll more likely turn to WRPGs like Dragon Age, Mass Effect, etc... instead of things like SMT: Nocturne."

Dungeon crawlers are kind of like roguelikes in that they're more their own genre, and I just don't really like dungeon crawlers all that much."
JRPG,3dm3us,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:05:18 2015 UTC,"I could totally understand that, and it's to your point that, of all the games the Etrian series could have crossed over with, it ended up doing a crossover with Shiren's Mystery Dungeon. Still, I use Etrian Odyssey as a quick-and-easy example of a JRPG that relies entirely on a niche appeal that's completely set aside from the mainstream American 'JRPG reception' (i.e. gamer bros and self-styled 'geeks' who are losing their shit over the announcement of the FF7 remake, but would never know or care that we still haven't gotten the beautiful-looking Dragon Quest 7 remake for the 3DS!). I'd put the Disgaea and Atelier series in similar boats.  Though I tend to enjoy the cold, hard, needling cartography of the Etrian games, I generally like the SMT dungeon crawlers a lot more. Strange Journey was a phenomenal game."
JRPG,3dm3us,ScribbleBliss,3,Sat Jul 18 11:13:01 2015 UTC,"It was such a good game. I remember playing it for the first time, probably 2005, and it was floored. I can't say enough good about this game and recommend it to anyone who loves Persona but has never played a core Megaten game. It's a must play. I played it again recently and found it funny how my memories of playing the game the first time felt like I'd played for 30 hours just to get to Ikebukuro. In reality it was only a few hours. I also remember being stuck on Dante for the longest time too."

JRPG,3dm2ij,ishkabibbel2000,7,Fri Jul 17 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just now getting around to playing Persona 4 Golden.    First 4 hours     Everything since  SFW      The game was dragging in the beginning in the sense that there is a TON of setup and story before you really get to do anything.  After about 4 hours, it opens up and becomes one of the best games I've played in a long time.    I'd always heard people make that claim and thought, ""at this point, even if I do get around to playing it, it's been built up so much that there's no way it can deliver"".  Boy, was I wrong.  No single aspect of the game is mindblowingly awesome, but everything is done just perfectly so that the overall experience is amazing.     If you haven't played it, I suggest you do so."

When I got my Persona I felt accomplished though and already invested in the story. I had played Persona 3 before though so I knew what to expect, so perhaps that's why I wasn't minding the slow beginning. I instantly liked the small town setting."
JRPG,3dm2ij,qchto,5,Sun Jul 19 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"After months of having a PS4 in stand-by, I got Omega Quintet last week. I bought it despite of what most reviews I found in the internet said, but now with ~40h in (taking my time, not rushing) I must say I'm far from disappointed. So, I decided to make the game justice with a review of my experience so far (sorry in advance for the wall of text).  While the story is going nowhere as epic as most people expect from an JRPG (so long, at least) and most of the ""character development"" scenes are taken straight out from an harem-themed VN (could be a plus for you), the setting is original enough to keep me interested. And in all fairness, even if some of the scenes are facepalm-worthy, I did chuckle here and there.  The battle system is very bland at the beginning, but with incremental unlocks along the story progress it certainly integrates the mechanics into the plot (and even some dialog) in a well structured way. Just be warned, it took me ~10h to unlock all of the options, but the combat becomes a totally different beast once you unlock Harmonics.  The plot progression follow pretty much the same formula of Compile Heart games (accept main quests, go out, small-talk at some locations, unlock sub-quests, go to dungeon, come back, report sub-quests, report main quests, advance with the story). Not the shiniest of the methods, but gets the job done. Although, sub-quests becoming unreaportable after chapter endings has affected the flow of the game for me.  Talking about reused formulas, dungeons are designed in the same vein of Hyperdimension Neptunia games, but that their scale is far more massive. Luckily, discoverable entrances are in place for you to not be forced to repeat all your way to certain points.  Micromanagement, same deal as combat. It can appear overwhelming at first but once you understand the logic behind the options available, you may be willing to give them a closer look (or at least will be able to rush your way through them). Item creation and disassembling are complementary and pretty much mandatory later in the game. Outfit repairs and strength is something to keep in mind between exploration as combat performance is very reliant on this (as a manager, the outfit ripping mechanic makes a lot of sense and is a great addition to keep an eye in the equipment of every member of your party).  Worth mentioning, the MAD Encyclopedia and Archives worth a look every now and then to expand on the details of the world setting.  That being said, the game has it shortcomings. The first and most obvious: the graphics are nowhere near of what the PS4 (or even the PS3) is capable of (which only makes me think it may have started development as a Vita game).  Tutorials are just glorified images, with much of the information on mechanics just thrown to your face and not really easy to follow at first (but coming from Compile Heart, it was kind of expected).  And, I find the VA to be good overall in both languages, but scarce in English (most of the VN scenes are not dubbed) and not reliable enough in Japanese (this being because some of the dialog really integrates into the mood of battle, but subtitles are difficult to follow or non-existent), so I find myself changing the language to English while exploring and battling and to Japanese while interacting with the cast.  So, that's it. As I told in the beginning, I haven't finished the game yet, but so far it has given me enough reasons to consider it worth the price I paid for it.  Oh, and I can't really leave without mentioning the music. The BGM alone was one of the decisive factors I take into account to buy this game, so I'd recommend checking it by yourself if you have the time.  TL;DR: The game is not for everyone (and definitely not for someone looking into story over gameplay), but if the premise alone peaks your interest, you enjoy smart-play and deep mechanics, are willing to spend time experimenting them and can appreciate gameplay over graphics, you may want to give it a try. And is definitely a game to get for <$25."
JRPG,3dm2ij,cmnamost,2,Fri Jul 17 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I've had my eye on this game. I noticed that you mentioned the voices are scarce in English. Are you saying that there are more scenes with voices when the language is Japanese?"
JRPG,3dm2ij,qchto,3,Fri Jul 17 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly yes. I started playing the game in Japanese (I usually do it if possible as English is also a foreign language to me and most of the time VA is better in the original release), but I changed to the English dub mid-game after Ayumi started announcing the battles (trust me, those lines can be pretty useful to keep track of your team mid-battle).  It wasn't long after returning to the office (it acts as a headquarter between missions in the game) that I noticed the secondary events felt awkwardly empty (much of the scene mood depends on voice tones), so I started changing the language back and forth depending the situation.  Btw, there are non dubbed dialogs in Japanese, but they are the exception rather than the rule and I think they are shorter and put more emphasis into the information given than anything else."
JRPG,3dm2ij,cmnamost,2,Fri Jul 17 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"I've never played a Legend of Heroes game before, but MY GOD Trails of cold steel (sen no kiseki) is the best game I've played in a long time.  It's like Persona x Harry Potter.  The game takes place in a school, and you do events over the course of a set of calendar days, and build social links, etc. Sound familiar?   Not only is it really long and has a story that I want to see what happens next, the gameplay is really fun. I'm very much looking forward to playing more games in this series!"
JRPG,3dm2ij,Dan_Tsukasa,3,Fri Jul 17 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"Visually I think the game is pretty lazy art wise, but I've not played it yet and I forget when the English release comes out.  Is it difficult in Japanese? Are you regularly looking at a dictionary as you play, I can't enjoy a game if I'm having to look up words and terms every 2 minutes."
JRPG,3dm2ij,cmnamost,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:10:11 2015 UTC,"I think I disagree that the art part is due to laziness - Remember this is a small team whose games traditionally did well if they sell over 100k copies. One thing they have going for them is that they actually used some shaders, which can't be said for Fairy Fencer F which somehow managed to run at like 10 fps. So at least this team has that going for them!  The Japanese is above average difficulty in this game for 2 reasons:  1) The plot centers around the relationships between nobles, royalty, politicians, military leaders, etc. Everyone is using a very high level of vocabulary. I'm constantly stopping and forwarding words to my flashcard app after looking them up  2) Going back to the fact that this dev team never had huge amounts of money, the voice acting is on/off all over the place, so you don't get as much advantage from being able to hear/read words at the same time. Not only are not all characters voiced, many of them aren't voiced at the same time in conversations, so you'll have scenes where only a subset of people in a particular scene are voiced. I think they did this to give each character the same amount of on-screen voice?  The good news is that the game is excellent technically. The download size was ~3.5G, and the sequel (which I have not played yet as this game is long) clocks in at ~4.5G. I'm really hoping that the extra gigabyte went to more voices!"
JRPG,3dm2ij,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Sat Jul 18 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think visually you're right, its not laziness its just them adapting badly to FULL 3D and having the player be able to see everything from every angle, they adapted by the 2nd game but the first is visually subpar compared to what you expect from Falcom.  To be fair the games sell much better in asia than in Europe and NA, but I still don't think they ever hit anything like the 500k mark.  I'll await the English release, then once I finish that I'll get the Japanese one, so I know the plot and its more a matter of focusing on the language."
JRPG,3dm2ij,SafariDiscoLion,4,Sat Jul 18 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Legend of Dragoon on PSN for a few days now. I really like the combat system but the game moves too slowly for my taste. Combat animations are long, especially dragoon transformations and spell casts, and so far the plot hasn't really gone anywhere about 10 hours in. I don't think I'll play much more of it.  Also been playing Tales of Xillia. I've never played a Tales game before and I'm enjoying it so far. Enough to stick through the whole game, I'm not sure, but we'll see. I don't really dislike anything about it so far, the combat or levelling system or the plot or anything, but it's not really hooking into me and making me want to play it all the time."

It was a little rough at the beginning due to low hit rate and my black belt being practically useless, but I quickly got to the point where my party could steamroll everything. I don't think I was aware that I could use weapons as items in this game. Having free Fir2 and Lit2 casts anytime makes the mages a lot more useful.  Overall, having a blast with the game. Until recently I never gave NES era RPGs much of a chance (started playing in SNES era) because I thought they would be too archaic and grindy, but I've actually had a lot of fun with all of them that I've played.

JRPG,3dm2ij,jodansokutogeri,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"Almost done with Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, really surprised with how much I enjoyed. The combat shares alot of similar ideas with fighting games, mainly having a heavy focus on spacing your characters and punishing after breaking through the opponents defenses. What also surprised me is that while some characters are better than others, none of them were useless and had ways to capitalize on their strengths. The game was pretty grindy but the combat was more than fun enough to justify it. It's too bad there were so many recycled assets throughout the game, it was clear the game didn't get the budget it needed and I hope Victory II doesn't fall prey to that. The story was also fun, being extremely self aware and having a fantastic cast (except for Noire) with a lot of chemistry. Got Re;Birth 1 during the summer sale and I'll be playing that fairly soon now that I've finishing this one up.  Just started The Guided Fate Paradox, a sorta roguelike JRPG with slightly less than permanent death. Basically you get to keep your character but you lose everything he gained entering the dungeon. You also don't keep go back to level 1 every time you start a new dungeon, but when you clear a dungeon all your progress converts into higher base stats across the whole game. Very odd game, not very far into but I'll be changing that soon. The story is that you became god via a lottery drawing and now you have to answer the prayers of both real people and of characters in fiction, and going through these dungeons is an abstract way of showing how you go about answering their wishes as god. Also not near as religiously loaded as you might think, it's surprisingly light hearted.  Still slogging through Final Fantasy Type-0. The core combat and RTS sections are fantastic but the school and overworld are a complete drag and really bring the game down. The story is retarded but I've started enjoying it ironically so I don't really care."

The combat is so interesting if I were more well versed I could probably find something to compare it to but as of now I can't, but still all in all a fantastic game."
JRPG,3dm2ij,Arthquake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"Radiant Historia for the Nintendo DS  I like it so far even though the story does not intrigue me that much, pretty much the standard evil empire plot with some plottwists here and there but nothing special. The converging timelines are a great idea but not 100% well executed as at some stages the logic of the whole thing falls so easily apart, it's laughable. I like some sidequests as at least one I encountered had also a huge impact on the main storyline which as I experienced occurs rarely in JRPGs. I'd love to see less but more important relevant quests in JRPGs, a design choice which seems to be exclusive to WRPGs which I don't play that much..  The music is, without a doubt, great as usual from Yoko Shimomura, I think I might be the only one who enjoyed other soundtracks from her much more than those from the Kingdom Hearts series, they are good but none came close to the feelings I had with the Super Mario RPG soundtrack for example..  The battle system is just a mixture of battle systems from other JRPGs/strategy games but it's well made and is the main reason why I like this game, it doesn't reinvent the wheel that much, but it still takes some good aspects from many of the great JRPGs we all love and pours them into one pot of fun.  I also like the monster designs&and the graphics a lot, they have this cartoony feeling which I could look at the whole day, vivid and colorful.  Well, this pretty much already sounds like a review but I'm still playing it, I don't think so much of my opinion will change over the rest of the game :D  TL;DR : Good game, a bit overhyped but still thoroughly enjoyable, I recommend it to oldschool JRPG fans."

JRPG,3djlzk,ffxivthrowaway03,0,Fri Jul 17 05:18:12 2015 UTC,There is very little that SquEAnix can do to win me back as a loyal customer and fan.  FFXV would have to be the best fucking game ever made.
JRPG,3djlzk,demafromua,0,Fri Jul 17 10:23:57 2015 UTC,Cool story.
JRPG,3djlzk,ffxivthrowaway03,0,Fri Jul 17 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, yeah. Everything was already clear when they shot down Chrono Restoration - nothing good would come out of it.  None of their games ever since year 2000 came close to the level of their SquareSoft lineup (except some of the remakes like FFT: War of the Lions). Their mobile department is a joke (only FFIII and somewhat FFIV can stand on its own), After Years was a lot of non-imaginative bullshit, Crisis Core was mostly crap (though Zack, Cloud and Aerith were still cool), FF XIII (2/3)... don't even get me started on this load of bullshit.  The World Ends with You and Kingdom Hearts series (except Re: Coded and Re: CoM) and to some extent FF XII are their only games that were really good for the last ten years. Think about it."
JRPG,3djz0x,Choubugioxkei,4,Thu Jul 16 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"this is falcom's persona-like rpg due out in japan in september. i been following siliconera's news to see how persona-like it'd be, and this is the point where i will buy it sight unseen.  'course it's gotta come out in the states first, but it's falcom, so i'm sure xseed'll bring it over eventually."
JRPG,3djz0x,pantsyman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:53:31 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah good joke im still waiting for Tits SC here not to mention the rest of the series, yes i know cold steel is coming sometime, at least they said so but what about the 3 games before them they skipped?"
JRPG,3djz0x,KotakuSucks2,2,Thu Jul 16 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"SC got so ridiculously delayed because Carpe Fulgur couldn't handle the pressure of having deadlines and ended up wasting everyone's time for a full year.  And they explained why they skipped the other 3 to get to Sen, they need to get Sen out the door before the PS3 is completely abandoned since the PS4 is taking the world by storm for some reason.  Hopefully they go back to Azure, Zero and third chapter.  There is a fan translation of Azure in progress though."
JRPG,3djz0x,pantsyman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:46 2015 UTC,If they where smart they would just port them over to PS4 (since there are allrdy PC versions this shouldn't be that hard yes the games don't look next gen but if SE can do it with the Pc version of FFVII who cares) and release them together with  the PC versions in the west later on. I kinda don't like skipping ahead in the storyline since all the games are related and the Crossbell arc is important for Sen too. Not to mention that my Ps3 broke some time ago and i just have Ps4 and a Pc atm :( i don't really plan to buy Ps3 again just to play Sen.
JRPG,3djz0x,KotakuSucks2,2,Fri Jul 17 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"They have a single programmer in house supposedly.  They'd need Falcom to port the game and Falcom isn't likely to make a port just to please english speaking audiences when they're a niche of a niche of a niche over here.  Look up the steamspy stats of Ys 6, a grand total of 6000 copies sold at full price, during the big steam sale about 6000 more copies sold.  With sales like that, I kind of doubt that Falcom sees us as profitable enough to warrant the effort of making additional ports."
JRPG,3djz0x,pantsyman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"Ys is something else entirely its a hardcore action rpg series and way more niche then a traditional jrpg series like TitS (http://steamspy.com/app/251150 120k doesn't seem bad to me...) not to mention Ys 6 is like the worst of the modern Ys games by far, it works pretty well for the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re Birth games so i really don't see why TitS shouldn't be even more popular. They should think about it there is definitive a market here  for traditional jrpgs  they can't do games only for the japanese market for legacy platforms like the vita and ps3 forever (seems like they had to give up on the ps3 allrdy with their latest games so the dead vita is the only thing left...), mobile games are about the only thing that sells there atm anyway and it won't get much better."
JRPG,3djz0x,KotakuSucks2,2,Fri Jul 17 07:12:33 2015 UTC,"Vita's still reasonably popular in Japan, it probably has several years of life left in it over there, its only dead in the west.  Ys 8 is on the PS4 and its likely whatever the next Kiseki game is will be too, so you'll get your wish, honestly I'd rather they just stick with the PS3, its not like their games are ever graphical powerhouses and I don't plan to ever buy a PS4, paid online access can suck my dick."
JRPG,3djz0x,pantsyman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:27:51 2015 UTC,The PS4 does make PC ports a lot easier too and as you can see from Tits sales on steam i posted above it is profitable. You surely have PC that can play them so this should be in your interest too.
JRPG,3djz0x,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Fri Jul 17 07:34:20 2015 UTC,"The PS4 makes PC ports easier, but that only matters if you already have a PS4 version.  From a sales perspective it makes sense, but it depends if Falcom CARES, having released Sen on only PS3 and Vita likely means they made some sort of deal with Sony, because prior to that they were always releasing games on PC first and then console later. (though the west only got the console releases until TitS)."
JRPG,3djz0x,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Fri Jul 17 08:22:36 2015 UTC,"If they where smart they would just port them over to PS4   They're a localization company, they translate stuff, they fix the occasional error that pops up, thats where it ends, they don't have the manpower.  Play sen on your vita then, thats my plan.  Square did it with FFVII because it was a PC GAME at one point, its just a driver fix thats all, porting a game to an entirely different architecture isn't a quick thing at all.  All the games are related true, but they take place the otherside of the world, theres only the rare mention of something that'd work in the previous games, largely its collectable items like the book series and so on."
JRPG,3djz0x,pantsyman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:19:33 2015 UTC,"I was talking about Falcom porting them not XSeed, XSeed is also not the only company that is localizing games if they don't have the resources to localize them maybe it's time for Falcom to work with other Partners as well it seems worth it to me. All games other then Sen have a PC version so it's easy porting them over. As for Sen and other VITA excusive games: porting game engines from the VITA to PC or PS4 is pretty easy btw since it runs natively with opengl that's why we get all those Neptunia ports lately. I don't have a VITA  and i don't play on handhelds in general my last one was the original Gameboy from 89 lol well there is always a cheap VITA TV as an option ."
JRPG,3djz0x,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Fri Jul 17 08:48:42 2015 UTC,"Porting games from the VITA is pretty easy btw it runs natively with opengl.   Unless you're sitting there now porting a game from the PS3 to Vita this doesn't mean all that much, not being rude, but that really oversimplifies the entire process.  Architecture is completely different, thats the big thing, it'd require rewriting a lot of things, not to mention rewriting the way the games systems communicate with the various parts of the PS3 (I want to say cells, but its to early for me and I'm half asleep) that don't exist on the vita.  They could put it in a wrapper and sort of emulate it a little, but that'd have a high memory usage anyway. Not to mention if the game is hardocded in a few key areas relating to memory, and Japanese games quite often do hardcode things because thats just how Japan seems to do stuff, even hardcoding various things in the game to be dependent on the framerates.  This excludes whether the games engine was written from the ground up to take full advantage of the PS3 and Vita architecture, with perhaps no settings at all to run on anything else, so then the engines going to need a lot of fixing up itself. Its possible but I don't see it happening for a long time.  If they were going to re-release it in Japan it'd make sense, but to my knowledge no Japanese company has re-released a game on an entirely different console ONLY in the west.  Falcom just want to make other games it seems. They might do it in like 5 years though, since they did release PS3 and Vita versions of the PSP Kiseki games, but we do know that took them like a year to do since its not their main focus.  Everyones really hyped about the 2 ps3 Kiseki games, including me, but visualy the games look so god damn lazy, I'd really like if someone at XSEED came in and redid a few of the textures at least, thats the games biggest issue. Even Falcom themselves publicly stated that its because they weren't used to using the PS3 and fixed most of those visual issues with the 2nd game."

Dunno about Ps3 that's really a totally different thing but PS4 and PC can run opengl code so it is very easy."
JRPG,3djz0x,ffxivthrowaway03,3,Fri Jul 17 09:05:31 2015 UTC,"OpenGL is a graphical rendering API.  It's how you tell the video card to draw the pretty pictures.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the system architecture, operating system, or getting software to run on a completely different platform.  PS4, XBONE, and PC are all easy to port between because they're all based on x86 architecture, it has nothing to do with OpenGL."
JRPG,3djz0x,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Fri Jul 17 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"Mac and PC both run OpenGL code, as do iPhones and iPods, and I think Androids do too, those aren't similar devices outside of the fact they run OpenGL, the way they're setup isn't similar, iOS uses sandboxing for its applications whereas PC and Mac don't.  Its true once you're on PS4 or the new Xbox then porting to PC isn't the huge headache it once was, will still require some code rewrites but its nothing compared to the headache of porting from PS3 to PS4. Even companies like Square Enix took several months to port from Vita and PS3 to PS4 with FFXHD, and they've a lot more people and money than Falcoms ever had.  Hell even Linux Runs OpenGL, but porting something to Linux is so irritating most games and software, even the top ones, don't even bother with it. It might make them 10k more sales, but ti might also cost them 30k to port it over. I see it as being a lot like this for PS4 in regards to PS3 games.  More people own a PS3 than a PS4 since the PS3 isn't yet Phased out, porting a PS3 game to PS4 with the same visuals isn't going to get many more sales. Hell Trails in the Sky on PSP didn't do all that great, PSP did several times better if I remember correctly from what Xseed said a while back. I don't see Sen selling all that great either. Seems Falcom are pushing toward consoles now, I'm sure in the next year or 2 we'll see them remaster something for PS4, or just release a new PS4 title in the Kiseki universe."

I know she isn't the most popular character, and she can get a little grating, but she really accentuates the thing that makes the game unique (and what I like more than the sequel): the feeling of dread.  There isn't an apparent central enemy; no, everything is your enemy.  This is most apparent roughly half-way through the game. At that point, really, everything seems to be against you. The demons want to kill you, the government wants to kill you, God wants to kill you, the Shomonkai ain't exactly friends, the citizens and police want to kill you, and even your friends start going insane. Only your small trio seems to have your back.  It was her dialogue that got me to try roleplaying a bit, and holy shit, I really just wanted to go home. It seems such a stretch for you and your three amigos to do anything against the everything that's out to get you.  So, yes, she's annoying and keeps trying to detract from your dreams of punching God or whatever, but that's really made this game's setting special."

That being said, there isn't a ""Lower than any other score you will ever give someone in any scoring"" for Midori, so I'm really not voting.  In the end, most of the characters are just as good as their roles allow- No one really stands out of delivers above and beyond their role like we get in DeSu2. We get some good ones, but no character that is instantly the best or well done more than any other.  You still need the option to stab Midori as soon as you meet her, though. Like, her character was annoying enough, but then the voice acting just fucking killed any chance of even giving her a pass."

JRPG,3ddqhz,comp2205,3,Wed Jul 15 15:32:19 2015 UTC,SO3 with the limited move set and the strong/weak close/far mechanics really was my favorite system. I wish they would have expanded on that.  But I am fine with IU's combat. It just didn't feel well thought out and fun. I hope they take that base and turn it into something fantastic because I'm convinced there was a brilliant system there that just wasn't utilized well.

It was kind of cool the way certain characters had abilities you could use to navigate the map with.   Aa far as combat goes, it wasn't too bad either.

Same basic system for encountering and fighting an enemy, but you could create combos through the 2 different attack buttons, and then chain your skills in."

It had so much potential that i didn't meet, but I actually enjoyed the battle system despite it being simple and clunky in some ways.  You have tons of characters that you can choose from to be in your battle party.  You have tons of items in the world to buy/discover.  I don't remember if there's a blacksmithing feature, but I think there was.

If anyone who played the game can explain what this means, I'd love to understand it better. Watching battle videos didn't really convey a sense of ""MMORPG-like complexity"" that I could tell."
JRPG,3ddqhz,bennyr,3,Wed Jul 15 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"It was more open-world action-y.  If you played Magna Carta 2 it was similar to that.  There's no set arena, you just see enemies on the map, pull your weapons out, and go to town on them.  There's still targeting, range, aoe skills, and all the same considerations that Star Ocean/Tales of fans are familiar with, it just doesn't happen in it's own self-contained arena.  I guess FFXII would be a good example too, where you're fighting in real time but there's still a lot of animation locks and forced delays between actions so it's not a twitch action combat at all.  Honestly, the combat was the only decent part of Infinite Undiscovery, but I can see where some fans of Star Ocean aren't going to receive the change well.  It can be done very well, but it can also be done very poorly.  If they just evolve what they already did with SO: TLH by removing the ""touch an enemy- fight group of enemies in the arena"" portion and plop the enemies right on the map I don't see where it will be bad, just not the same.  TLH already had a lot of that open-world MMO feel to it and IMO it did it very well."

JRPG,3ddqhz,Amocoru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:06:01 2015 UTC,Gameplay wasn't stellar but the plot of the second half of the game was fantastic. The first half made me want to quit but the back half made me super happy I didn't.  IU makes me sad because it could have easily been one of the best rpg's I've ever played. A little more polish on the story and combat system and it would have been perfect. But what we got was just clunky
JRPG,3ddqhz,lowkeyoh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:05:05 2015 UTC,The game play was terrible. But the battle system was decent. The whole dungeon sy st em was horrendous as far as gameplay. Ok now to proceed further in the story you pretty much must consult your walkthrough on where the invisible wall that you have to play music in front of is... or just play music around the entire dungeon to find it. Terrible system. But battles were fun.

JRPG,3datk0,SGlespaul,3,Wed Jul 15 01:49:22 2015 UTC,There is a undub for the first game if you don't mind japanese voices. The voice acting in the second game was fine. The games play fine in Dolphin btw probably some of the fastest running games since most of it is 2d. They look even better in 1080p.

That said, your analysis seems reasonable to me.  One interpretation of her choice of a romance plot in her first five cosmosphere levels is that she believes herself to be trolling everyone involved a bit, regardless of what her feelings might actually be. My sense is that it was acting but with enough truth to make it plausible. Croix approached her story with sincerity. That had to count for something in her mind... enough to give them confidence in a working relationship, anyway. Apparently enough for her to let him see more.  I see what you're saying, but I really don't feel like it was a change (9 -> conscious mind). Jacqli was nothing if not focused. Subtle things might have been going on under the hood but it was going to take more to derail her. Even if she hadn't been burned so badly by caring she's pretty out of practice in most of what you'd consider a normal emotional range.  I've been thinking about replaying since the music keeps coming up. I'll let you know what I think then."
JRPG,3dc027,laod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this sounds like a reasonable explanation. I hadn't considered her using the Cosmosphere as a big joke, but it would make some sense considering the initially silly premise (though the other characters' first Cosmosphere levels were also silly).  It wasn't really a change in Jakuri's character so much as it was a jarring shift for me because for some reason I thought Jakuri would be more open to starting a relationship with Croix until I remembered that she didn't actually know what happened in the level 9 Cosmosphere. At first it felt like I was seeing the same conflict that was already resolved in the Cosmosphere playing out again.  If you do end up replaying the game then I suggest that you give the fan relocalization a try. It's still in beta but it's perfectly playable with only a couple of grammar mistakes."
JRPG,3dc027,laod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"The thing that seals the deal for me on that is her insistence on having Cloche and Luca along.  I understand better what you meant now. At the risk of sounding melodramatic (hah! ship: sailed), the feeling I have at the end of a cosmosphere level is a little like waking up from a dream.  I'll check it out, thanks. I did grab it and patch the game with it ages ago but I had just finished full clearing and wasn't really up to going again. I would imagine it's come a long way."

When he breaks and just repeats Barrel. Barrel. Barrel. over and over? Gold. I wish I could find my favorite scene (perhaps fan-made?) of Claude and Ashton arguing over a diamond in a store... turns out Ashton just wanted the barrel underneath it.

JRPG,3d44n2,Kenpokid4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Evolution: The World of Sacred Device and Evolution 2: Far Off Promise. Unlike SoA, the Gamecube version is actually worse, cutting most of the dungeons out of 1.  The first game has you going through Mystery Dungeon-esque ruins, hunting for relics of the previous civlization, all the while hunting for the legendary Cyframe (the previous civilization's machines that the spelunkers use), Evolutia. The plot is light, but enjoyable enough.  The second game has you investigating ruins near a larger city to assist a famous researcher. The ""main story"" takes a bit to pick up in this one, and can't really be described without spoiling the first game. This one gets a bit heavier on plot, and has not one, but two 100 floor dungeons, to my knowledge (one of which is optional). It also has voice acting, but Japanese only to my knowledge. I think the dungeons are static in this one; at least, in the second act of the GameCube ""remake"" they were."

I got it and it's like playing an upbeat RPG version of A Link to the Past, Secret of Mana, or Landstalker. It feels like an SNES game.  If you want an amazing single player oldschool game, Ori and the Blind Forest is the best Metroidvania since Super Metroid and Castlevania SOTN.  JRPGs on Steam from Falcom are worth looking at. Ys games. Gurumin. Trails in the Sky.  Steam is the best platform these days. Check these games out too: Valkyria Chronicles, Castle in the Darkness, Shantae Risky's Revenge, Freedom Planet, Chasm looks like it'll be good."

Also Bravely default end game apparently sucks?"
JRPG,3d44n2,Timewinders,4,Mon Jul 13 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"If you liked SMT IV and Fire Emblem then Devil Survivor: Overclocked and Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker are obvious choices. Both are a fusion of turn-based strategy RPG on a grid and turn-based RPG.  I also liked Tales of the Abyss on the 3DS - it has the best story out of the Tales games IMO (though the main character can be a bit grating in the first quarter of the game).  On the Vita, you should play Soul Sacrifice if you haven't already. More of a monster-hunting game than a traditional RPG, but the combat is pretty fun and it has a good story. Personally I thought the story was better in the vanilla edition without the additions of the Delta edition, but the Delta edition has some improved mechanics.   Yeah, I wouldn't recommend Bravely Default. The story was okay but nothing special, and the end game really did suck. Fun battle system, but you might be better off waiting to see if Bravely Default 2 is an improvement on the story end."
JRPG,3d44n2,JRD_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"Before I purchased Bravely Default I had heard horror stories of the end game, but one day I decided to just take a risk and pick it up. End game Bravely Default was a huge misstep for an otherwise great game. For me, the end game didn't ruin the experience - I finished the game and still ended up loving it. But yes, everything you've heard about end game Bravely Default is true, but you can blaze through it fairly quickly if you're leveled enough and hopefully, if you decide to get it, it won't sour the experience for you.  EDIT: Words"
JRPG,3d44n2,Timewinders,3,Tue Jul 14 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"Endings that drag are pretty common in JRPGs so I agree that it wasn't as bad as some people make it out to be, but the problem for me was that the rest of the game wasn't very good either and didn't make the drag worth it.

JRPG,3d44n2,Cocopoofs,2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"I would recommend either Dragon Quest III (SNES translation patch/DS) or Dragon Quest V (PS2 translation patch/DS). They both have mechanics that start in these particular games (class system/monster training) that carry on into most other entries into the series. I personally recommend V as the monster capture system is extremely addicting, giving you around 30 party members you can use. After playing one of these games and are comfortable with the series, jump on Dragon Quest VIII which is easily the pinnacle of the series imho.  All of the games have their own personal charm though, the quintessential versions are all worth playing imo.  Dragon Quest I&II (SNES, GBC) Dragon Quest III* (SNES, GBC) Dragon Quest IV (DS) Dragon Quest V* (PS2, DS) Dragon Quest VI (DS)  DQ VII and VIII are shortly getting 3DS ports. Give them all a shot!"

Not trying to be rude here, but...asking if you should buy Suikoden 1 & 2 is like asking ""Hey guys, I already have dirt and mud to eat this weekend, which I like, but I keep hearing a lot about this meat thing, a lot of people recommended it to me, should I try it ?"".....yes...yes you should."

Is it too hard to find them all without a guide?"
JRPG,3d44n2,JRD_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:44:01 2015 UTC,The mountain of characters is off-putting to me as well. With over 100 characters I feel that there will be very little connection to the characters in my party. Just my two cents.
JRPG,3d44n2,pantsyman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"Without a Guide ?  Well some of them are hidden extremely well like they pop up in dungeons you cleared 40 hours ago or require some specific statistics for example and  that's really some of the easier ones to recruit, some are only recruitable for a very short timeframe and if you miss that you can't get them in that playtrough there is no way to know that bevore, of course the best ending is only available if you recruited everyone and do some other stuff as well, in short there is a lot of well hidden and easily missable stuff especially in suikoden 2 so if you don't want to play these games for years to come, i would really  recommend playing at least with a recruitment guide and looking up the requirements for the best ending if you don't want to be frustrated."
JRPG,3d44n2,VashxShanks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"Apology accepted, lol jk.  First thing to note about the 108 characters is that not all of them are going to fighting in the party, a lot of them actually upgrade your castle and/or provide fun mini-games.  2nd thing is that about 50% of the characters will join automatically, so you won't actually be going around looking for 108 characters, more like 40-60 characters are the ones you have to get out of your way to get.  3rd thing is that in Suikoden 1 there are no characters that you can miss, none that I remember, you'll only need a guide if you can't find what you have to do to make them join, but even that is easy if you use the in game way of find how to make someone join. Only in Suikoden 2 and after that you'll start having miss-able characters that you need to keep an eye on or you'll miss them forever.  4th thing is that completion-est or not, you should always gather all 108 characters in every suikoden game you play, because that's how you always get the best ending."

Valkyrie Profile: Valkyrie can use a Bow as her main weapon, also lots of playable characters use spears and bows. Illousion of Gaia: Main character actually uses a Flute as his weapon to fight the hoard of darkness, that he uses in the same manner as a spear, same goes for Ark from Terranigma. Ar Tonelico 2: Main character uses a Lance/Machine gun, it's very cool. Chrono Cross: Serge uses the Swallow which is like a double headed spear.

JRPG,3czvsu,draekia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:02:24 2015 UTC,To each their own indeed. I kind of like being able to just grind vocations and levels while watching TV. It's just nice to know you're being productive in a game while doing something else.
JRPG,3czvsu,Vetches1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"The later DQ games -- Especially the ones with the job change system like DQ 6, 7, and 9 -- heavily reward overgrinding. Especially 9. Even though it's functionally an option, it's a nice bonus for that those of us who have high grinding endurance."
JRPG,3czvsu,darthreuental,28,Tue Jul 14 04:03:49 2015 UTC,Many Jrpgs nowadays require you to grind   I feel like I haven't really had to grind much in a game since the early PS1 era. I would say very few games today require it...  That said if games are built with grinding in mind I do tend to enjoy them. Good example being Dragon Quest. A simple but fast paced battle system and character progression that is well thought out (not getting overpowered too quickly). For some reason its addicting to me.  I absolutely loathe fetch quest grinding though haha.
JRPG,3czvsu,so3arbelnox,18,Sun Jul 12 09:01:17 2015 UTC,"i'm playing xenoblade chronicles 3d at the moment.   the number of quests that appear is absolutely ridiculous. but i still feel the need to complete as many as i can, and make sure i nail all of the collectables  the problem is that the world is so vast that it's super difficult to find the items requested or monsters to kill. and don't even start me on drop rates of some rare items.  even after grabbing the stuff you need, finding the npc who asked you to do whatever it was is a challenge due to the in game clock and the fact that they wander around like crazy  the xp rewards are reasonable though. even if leveling up doesn't seem to make a difference in a lot of rare monster fights   so yeah, i'm conflicted about this one. i feel like my compulsion to complete optional stuff is really impacting on what is an awesome story"
JRPG,3czvsu,hybby,7,Sun Jul 12 09:17:39 2015 UTC,"If you're the type of person who plays games more than once, I'd strongly recommend using new game plus to do all the quests. I don't know where you are in the story, but anywhere after the second or third major area and the plot was so engrossing that I just didn't want to touch the 400+ quests that there are. I also found that the amount of experience you get from doing every quest trivializes most of the story battles.  Fwiw, levels do pretty strongly impact accuracy/evasion rolls against enemies, and that has a big impact on your team's efficiency."
JRPG,3czvsu,intothepainting,5,Sun Jul 12 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"I found that Xenoblade wasn't very rewarding in terms of grinding, and the quests felt like a waste of time."
JRPG,3czvsu,EpsilonX,3,Sun Jul 12 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"Leveling doesn't make a huge difference until you encounter monsters that are several levels higher than your own. If their name is colored yellow or red, your accuracy and evasion against those enemies will be SEVERELY hindered. You can fix some of this with gems, but the only true way around it is to meet their level.  The quest system is actually well designed in that almost every NPC will be out and about at either 10pm or 10am. You can check your affinity chart to see which 10 o'clock it is, and then you can check your quest log to see which landmark they were closest to. No quest ever requires the rarest of rare drops. Most quest items have a lower cap of a 20% drop rate or so.  Usually, the quest will say ""this monster that you need to kill/that drops this item is found near this location"" and if you've been exploring everywhere, you'll have the location on your map somewhere and you can go find them easily.  And, if you don't feel like doing the optional stuff, ignore it. If and when you get to a point where enemies are just way too high leveled for you, go to the most recent town and do some side quests at that point. The side stuff is definitely not worth ignoring the main plot of the game because that main plot is absolutely amazing."
JRPG,3czvsu,Quote_a,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:51:43 2015 UTC,I'm playing it now following one of the better FAQs on GameFAQs. I'm doing most of the side quests that are available.  I'm not sure if I hit the amazing story part of the game yet.  From what I can remember I'm chasing Metal Face and Melia(sp?) is talking to her dad.  Not terribly amazing just yet.

JRPG,3czvsu,Quote_a,11,Mon Jul 13 22:45:20 2015 UTC,Phantasy Star 2 was a huge grind. I remember leaving town for the first time and grinding for an hour just to buy a weapon. It sort of gets easier but at the beginning of that game grinding enough cash to get two Steel Pipes for Nei and a Steel Sword for Rolf took fucking ages.  Levelling wasn't so hard as the dungeons were incredibly complex and the encounter rate was so high that you would 'grind' passively by taking ages to get anywhere anyway.   Still loved the game although it hasn't aged so well.
JRPG,3czvsu,m00fire,2,Sun Jul 12 11:58:49 2015 UTC,There's a reason why every copy of the game sold in the US came with maps for every dungeon. The later ones have some extremely complex designs that involve pit falls.
JRPG,3czvsu,darthreuental,9,Tue Jul 14 04:05:49 2015 UTC,"Probably not a JRPG, but God was Ragnarok Online grindy af. I still remember turning my first character into a job 40 Priestess because I couldn't wait any longer to play as one! That definitely felt like a chore to me because leveling up in our local RO server is effed up (in its early days as a pay-to-play mmorpg).  Suikoden 2 comes to mind, especially the part where you have to level up 3 groups to fight Luca (yes, I took the time to level those 10 or so characters up and their weapons). Frankly, that and the road to Tinto are the two parts of Suikoden 2 that felt like a drag to me.  Bravely Default had a great system for taking care of grinding, quite possibly because the devs felt that the smartphone generation has made more gamers want to get that instant gratification that they get from short smartphone games. And when you think about it, jrpg players from the time when the genre has boomed has grown older, meaning we don't have much time for gaming nowadays unlike before so systems like this are very much appreciated.  Of course, I still kill precious time every now and then with Fantasy Life and Rune Factory."
JRPG,3czvsu,mocolief,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:17:41 2015 UTC,Early MMORPGs used to suck so much when it came to grinding.  I think I played on RO's legal server maybe once or twice before I decided to just stick with private servers.

Hopefully things get better later on in the game."
JRPG,3czvsu,Occultus_Cormag,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:00 2015 UTC,Fantasy Life was amazing but Rune Factory 4 did a way better job of making you feel like you were actually part of and living the life in the game.

JRPG,3czvsu,EchoingSong,7,Mon Jul 13 07:43:17 2015 UTC,Digital Devil Saga.  I kind of fucked up the Mantra table and grinded pixies for hours to over come it.  That entire game is all about exploiting weaknesses for press-turns.

JRPG,3czvsu,EpsilonX,3,Sun Jul 12 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"That's just pedantic. ""Press turn"" may not be but exploiting weaknesses is what defines SMT combat."

JRPG,3czvsu,D3is,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this difference is significant or worth typing about. ""Press turn"" is a mechanic that is widely understood and is a good enough descriptor to be generalized in this way imo. And as an RPG fan I'm sure I don't have to explain to you why exploiting weaknesses is core to SMT in a way that is different from all other RPGs.   Tales is a game that is defined by action gameplay, but nobody says ""well, there are lots of games with action gameplay..."".   People shouldn't have to specify to precise levels of details when precision is not important to the point they are making. It's a waste of time."
JRPG,3czvsu,Electrium,0,Mon Jul 13 04:46:36 2015 UTC,"All of the SMT games that I can think of, including all the spinoffs except the Raidou games, have the ""Exploit Weakness to gain extra actions"" with minor spins on the execution.

JRPG,3czvsu,DecemberFlame,7,Mon Jul 13 14:40:09 2015 UTC,Digimon World 2... Possibly the grindiest thing I've played.  Yeah it was a chore >.> (but i still loved it haha)
JRPG,3czvsu,restart_kun,5,Sun Jul 12 09:27:39 2015 UTC,That game was so grindy. I remember trying to get imperiadramon or some other Digimon and having to DNA digivolve so much. This game is truly impossible without a guide  I liked the game a lot though. Although I know that most people hate it.
JRPG,3czvsu,HnNaldoR,3,Sun Jul 12 11:48:17 2015 UTC,I talked to all the NPC and nowhere did the game explain DNA evolution properly. It just vaguely says the resulting Digimon will vary depending on the DNA points(was it? I forgot what it was actually called). If only it had a more reasonable scaling I'd have it as one of the most fun games I've played. (Collecting Digimons and getting the best team was exciting haha)
JRPG,3czvsu,restart_kun,4,Sun Jul 12 15:17:21 2015 UTC,I bought the prima guide to this game in order to understand it. The guide was really nice with pictures of all the Digimon and the guide to evolve to them. I tried to play this game on my psp a few years back but I did not go far before giving up. I think it's really not as bad as people remember but it is definitely weaker than dw3. Dw4 was the worst of the lot IIRC. I remember being excited to try it and hated lucky.
JRPG,3czvsu,HnNaldoR,2,Sun Jul 12 15:30:02 2015 UTC,Well DW3 had a fun card game so that's a plus haha.  Do you know if there's a scan of this guide somewhere in the internet?  I liked 4 but it was sorta silly haha.
JRPG,3czvsu,restart_kun,2,Sun Jul 12 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I am sure it's somewhere if you look hard enough.

JRPG,3czvsu,luthin2000,3,Sun Jul 12 21:42:24 2015 UTC,action based? ff12? huh... Well you can make the game play itself pretty much. Been playing the international version and I just set it on fast forward and mow through enemies cause of my gambits.

JRPG,3czvsu,ShiftySauce,5,Wed Jul 15 00:16:04 2015 UTC,"The Last Remnant, while an awesome JRPG, is very, very grindy, especially near the end of the game.

After 100+ hours put in, I didn't really feel like putting in another 10-20 to get the weapons needed to beat the final boss. As a note, the final boss gets harder the more side quests you do, I did 100% of them, so he was the absolute hardest he could have possibly been."
JRPG,3czvsu,godlyhalo,3,Sun Jul 12 11:37:06 2015 UTC,"The Last Remnant   That game was VERY confusing. If memory serves, the more you grind the harder the enemies were. I never actually beat the game, TBH."

JRPG,3czvsu,Darkilon,2,Sun Jul 12 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"The trick to The Last Remnant was to grind only groups of 1-2 strong enemies, so your stats will increase while keeping your Battle Rank low.    So really, the majority of the grinding is done in 2-3 segments.  Once towards the beginning of the game, then again in the second half.  If done properly, it's then possible to destroy everything in the game fairly easily."

JRPG,3czvsu,Sighto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"No, not that I recall.  Keeping your BR low did force you to skip 90% of encounters that weren't for the sole purpose of grinding, though.

I used to play Priston Tale. Back in the day the highest level weapons/armor pieces you could find were level 60-65 (there were usually around 0-8 level 65 items in a server TOTAL back then - to show you how rare they were.) So basically you were severely undergeared throughout the whole game. I grinded from 60-70 in 1 week with school, which took most players months or years to do.   Level 89-90 was 100 hours MINIMUM - if you didn't die and always had a place to fight monsters. Once again - I did this in one week with school. All of the other level 90 players spent 3-12 months getting there. The amount of exp required went up exponentially at this point (88-89 = 50 hours 89-90 = 100 hours . . . 90-100 was around a few thousand hours.) I was well known in my server back then for holding spawn points in 50-55 hour increments. It was funny having a guy run up and ask me to pm him when I leave. He would run back the next day and say ""You're still here?!?!"" 24 hours later he would come back by and be like ""YOU'RE STILL AWAKE?""  I quit at 90 and came back after a bunch of updates and exp was permanent x4 and cash shop items were enabled. A new class was released not too long ago and I got it to level 100 in 17 days, which I've never seen anyone match that speed. Average players take 6-12 months minimum to get to 100 - if they even make it.  To me the grinding is enjoyable to an extent, especially when compared with other MMORPGs. It is much more tolerable now at permanent x4 exp, lots of updates, level-appropriate equipment etc. I can make 500,000,000+++ exp per hour in PRIME conditions. . . at level 90 - before all of these updates - I capped out at 12,000,000 per hour. I really loved my friends that played this game back in the day and being the smallest competitive, yet still #1 ranked clan in the server was huge for my motivation. As soon as my friends started quitting I ended up quitting, even though I had promised myself to keep on playing - thinking it wouldn't affect me. It did :(."

JRPG,3czvsu,Warshade,2,Sun Jul 12 12:40:31 2015 UTC,I hate grinding. I really don't enjoy it at all. Mostly in mmos I can put up with it but turned based slow combat I no longer have the patience.   Last JRPG I played was Bravely Default and I didn't feel like I had to grind much but still had to more than I wanted too. I prefer you keep a nice balance just play the game you get the skills you need and let your own skill fill in the gap. When gear and stats matter more than my own skills as a gamer I don't feel the same connection.   I play JRPGs for the story above all else. To my I can enjoy it just as much if I rarely have to fight anything versus constant battles that are pointless. Make it matter.
JRPG,3czvsu,krazymofo421,2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"honestly building the perfect character in FF:Tactics is ridiculously difficult and grind heavy. You have to level them up as classes that give the proper stat buffs, then de-level via traps, then do it all over again. I remember a character taking me a week to perfect (though he was my first one)."
JRPG,3czvsu,Daverost,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:33 2015 UTC,I only had to do that once with Ramza. Had to take him down as Chemist and then all the way back up as... something. Knight? I was just trying to get him enough HP to survive Zodiac so that I could master every job with him.  Definitely a pain.
JRPG,3czvsu,krazymofo421,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"i just had a FFT flashback at work man, the guys next to me just saw me twitch haha. Glad to see someone was in pursuit of making Ramza the perfect fighter like I was. Made him the best unit in that entire game (You still can't compete with TG Cid, but that's neither here nor there). I plan on using him as my primary character in the new Dissidia game as well."
JRPG,3czvsu,worldwidewombat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, I remember this. I did it on almost all of my characters. I think the best way was to de-level them as a Chemist(?) and bring them back as Mime(highest physical attack growth IIRC) and ninja to offset the speed drop. I don't remember taking that long though. The game becomes hilariously trivial after that, including the optional dungeon. My ninja/monk was just moving across the map and punching everything to oblivion.  I remember doing something akin to min maxing in Tactics Ogre too, which require hunting animals and getting their meat for stat boost. A lot easier, but still extremely time consuming. The game also have scroll weapons, so you need to max a generic unit, give them the double speed equipment accessory and sacrifice them for a OP as heck weapon. I remember my Ravness having 3 turns before an enemy could get one with her maximized scroll Katana. Got 2/3 through the optional dungeon before I got really bored. Pretty sure nothing in the game can ever pose a challenge anymore."
JRPG,3czvsu,Megidolan,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:58 2015 UTC,"I personally I'm not really a fan of grinding. What a game can make to make it a fun process for me are an engaging battle system or many more option opened from grinding then simply gaining more stats.  To illustrate, engaging battle system for me were Resonance of Fate, Valkyrie Profile 2, on the top of my head. Now for for the games you open more options it's usually games with job systems since with each new job or ability you're allowed to tackle encounter in a different way which makes it much more fun, games like Bravely Default, FFV and alikes.  Other game the gives more options without jobs are Shin Megami Tensei games. Here you don't straight out gain many options but the more demons you get the more options you have in combat and for fusion. You can switch a demon from your party and things can get a little fresh. The lack of it in Digital Devil Saga may be one of the reasons I hated grinding on that game."
JRPG,3czvsu,allyallniggasisgay,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"Very little, lately. In the past I was okay with the absurd grinding because I had basically infinite freetime. Hours of walking around fragging stuff in Final Fantasy so I could buy some spells/potions/equipment was fine. But now if I feel compelled to sit through an hour or more of not-so-fun fighting just for better numbers, nah. If the fights are fun and there isn't too much loading or waiting involved, I feel more okay with it.   Example of okay grinding: Ys games I've played on PC (except Napishtim on PC, on hard/nightmare for maxing out weapons). For the most part, you hit caps really fast and the game basically says ""stop grinding and work on your technique if you want to beat that boss"". And the actual fighting is enjoyable and fast, and you can usually get to an appropriate level pretty quickly if you were skipping lots of enemies while exploring (I usually tend to skip fighting most enemies to advance through the games on Nightmare, because it's so easy to die... but then when I do settle in to kill stuff near a safe spot, I level up very quickly).  Example of not-okay grinding: I revisited SMT: Nocturne recently, and played on a new game + (so I didn't have to worry about fusion level caps and stuff, so no grinding). But I went for the TDE, which required some pretty silly stuff to get pierce-y demons for the finale. I opted out and put the game away instead. No desire to do some exotic leveling and fusing for hours just to get a particular skill to finish up the game.  Tales of the Abyss (PS2) is a great example of a game I'd hate to grind in. Fights take forever to load up, last about 2-5 seconds, and then afterwards take forever to wrap up. And you'd have to do a lot of fights to level up or acquire serious Gald. It could feel like only 1/3 of the time I was actually ""playing"". Fortunately, on the normal difficulty the game was braindead easy, so you could breeze through most of the game mashing ""attack"" without much trouble, with no grinding needed. Not sure about the last 1/3 of the game, as I stopped playing for various reasons."

I still didn't really enjoy it though.  I've never really felt that I've really needed to grind in any JRPG I've played in order to simply beat the game, but I do tend to thoroughly explore things, not avoid encounters and do many sidequests.  As for JRPGs I've spent time grinding levels for endgame content, there's FFVII, and FFX both of which I actually enjoyed the grinding.  Then there's Xenoblade Chronicles where I spent tons of time grinding side quests, which I also really enjoyed."
JRPG,3czvsu,thestinkypig,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:21:42 2015 UTC,I wish for grinding there was an auto fight option to just let it fight through random battles and let you heal occasionally as needed every 15 minutes. That way grinding won't require so much human interaction

JRPG,3czvsu,Purest_Prodigy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:19:53 2015 UTC,I think FFV was the game I grinded in the most. Mastered all the classes for every character for completionists sake. Took about 12 hours after getting to the last dungeon for the first time. In general I don't find myself grinding to overcome boss fights or dungeons though. There's probably less than 10 games out of the dozens I've played where it was necessary
JRPG,3czvsu,SiberianH,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on the game and how long grinding takes. I might be fine with a decent amount of grinding if the gameplay is fun, I'm interested in the characters, and/or the animations are cool.   I would say my tolerance for grinding is pretty high, though a lot lower than it used to be. I used to play RuneScape (MMO) and grinding in that game was both slow and pretty mundane for many of the skills (IE: sit at bank for 100 hours for a level 99 skill). Still sat for for hours doing the same thing over and over again. I still enjoy doing that now and again in JRPGs, just not nearly as much as I would have in the past."
JRPG,3czvsu,Mitchiro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"I personally hated grinding when I was younger and playing RPGs. I also got impatient sometimes towards the end of games and wanted to just skip everything and run straight to the last boss fight to see the end of the story.  This usually meant that I was underleveled and struggled through many fights! I've finished most of the early FF games in the lower to mid 30s, missed out on the most powerful spells/equipment due to not being able to challenge the extra bosses, and even in games like 10 have still never seen spells like Holy and Curaga on Yuna.   Nowadays, I'm a bit more patient but I think that's due to how I play games. Grinding in Bravely Default was really easy when you combine a bunch of ridiculous abilities, and I enjoyed being able to customize my team. I'm currently playing thru Dragon Quest series on mobile, and since it's so easy to pick up and play every now and then, I don't mind the grind.  TLDR; Younger me grinding on console games = awful. Older me grinding on mobile = tolerable."

JRPG,3czvsu,MentalNeko,2,Sun Jul 12 19:20:26 2015 UTC,Persona 3 and 4 were perfect for grinding.

I feel it just breaks the flow of the story (the PRIMARY reason I play JRPG) and feel it just detracts from the game.  It's one thing if during your travels you might have trouble with a boss and need to level up a few times to have an easier time but it's another entirely to have to spend extended periods of time in a lower level area just to survive in the next.  That said... if there is crafting or rare drops I will literally grind for hours.  Grindiest JRPG I've ever played was the Dragon Quest series. I hated grinding in DQ1 but love grinding in DQ9."

Wouldn't do that again I don;t think.  Hyper Dimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 has some grinding and it was pretty offputting until I fouind that the Alt Enemy plans added bosses that gave a level per kill just about. Hold the animation skip and spam EXE attacks with Rush ATtacks to build it back on trash waiting for a quick repop and I was able to make good progress from Chapter 4 to the final chapter in a few days.

JRPG,3czvsu,Quote_a,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"One game I really enjoyed grinding in was Bravely Default. You could speed the battles up way fast, crank up the encounter rate, and set your auto so that you finished every battle in a single turn. Valkyries get a move called Crescent Moon eventually that hits every enemy for a decent amount of damage. With two melee attacks using the move a total of four times, most enemy encounters were over. I actually had a blast grinding to max level with everyone because it was just so fun to grind for some reason.  I usually detest grinding in RPGs. I usually think it's boring and is not a way I want to spend 20 hours of an 80 hour game. I tend to like grinding slightly more if the grinding isn't what's stopping my progress. If I can move on without it, I might do it just for fun, but if I need to grind for a boss, I get frustrated and will likely put it off for a while."

JRPG,3czvsu,Sircheeksalot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"For me it depends on the grinding needed. For example, if you need to grind for a boss because you didn't get his weakness, depending on the length, might not be so bad because you have a clear goal in mind.  If you are grinding for certain items that are rare, it can become tiresome as you are leaving it to the RNG gods.  The worst for me are grinding for trophies/achievements. For example now I am grinding Lily ranks for Hyperdevotion Noire and I am ready to kill everyone in a 5km radius because of how long it's taking (I'd say another 10 hrs or so).  Grinding for me depends on the length and how quick rewards are given. If you have to grind for 4 hours but every 5 min or so, something happens (new skill, ability, cut scene, event, etc.) grinding no longer becomes tedious as you are constantly experiencing something new. The Grinds that are kill one guy, save, load, kill respawned guy, save, load, etc. are the most torturous grinds of all.  Also they most grindy game for me had to be FFT when I was little. I sucked ass at SRPG's and so grinding for spells or to make sure I was strong enough for the multiple battles (where I also learned the hard fact of only having one save) would force me to grind for hours and I hated every moment of it."

JRPG,3czvsu,Kyogre386,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"Do I tolerate it? To some pretty absurd extents at times (Pokemon Colosseum's endgame is insane, for example). Do I like it? No. I know it's a big thing JRPG's are known for, but I really don't get why it's there. What does it add? As far as I'm concerned, it's more faux difficulty than true difficulty. I would much rather games made the fights challenging in terms of strategy and skill rather than artificially creating difficulty by just raising the Stats to an absurd degree. I know it's harder, but the payoff is greater.  I certainly don't want Levels to go away, but a Level curve that doesn't require grinding at certain points and instead focuses on skill would be a lot more fun. A good example is DeRosa from Bravely Default. The main difficulty in beating him is realizing the trick to dealing with his gaining BP every time you hit him. He does have good Stats, but it's not like DeRosso's Dragons, which were just absurdly powerful for that point in the game and forced me to grind for hours to beat. It wasn't that there was a trick, they were just too strong.  I don't mind running into Level problems when attempting to speed through the game, encouraging a little exploration is fine. But when you've done literally everything and you STILL have to grind for 5 hours just to have a chance at winning, it's annoying, and breaks the flow of the game. Tales of Symphonia's beginning (Up until around Magnius and Kilia) still bugs me to this day, and it's even worse because they make you underleveled for the first dungeon on the lowest difficulty, before you even have the resources to efficiently grind.  I think Tales of the Abyss handled grinding quite well. The first real challenge (for me anyway) was Legretta, but you can win without grinding with some smart tactics. And in general it gives you decent difficulty without accomplishing it by forcing you to grind (unless you do Hard or Very Hard without using New Game+, or Unknown Mode, but that's your choice). More of that and DeRosa and less of DeRosso's Dragons and Evice would be nice."
JRPG,3czvsu,worldwidewombat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mind grinding if I don't need to pay a lot of attention to what's happening. DQ7 class grinding was amazingly easy and pretty much made my characters OP as shit right after unlocking classes. Made a beeline to the paladin class and that AOE attack one shots most of the early game encounters. You gain so little exp per battle it's hard to overlevel and class advancement is tied to battle counts. They're literally asking you to teach the game a lesson after the bullshit first third of the game.   DQM Joker 2 is fucking ridiculous in terms of trying to get the endgame monsters with proper skillset. Skillset isn't a huge issue, but to maximize the potential of each 'fusion' is very very grindy, perhaps more so than any SMT games I've played. A lot of high tier 'ingredient' monsters are tedious as hell to fuse as well, due to the cost. But I want to do that all again in Terry's Wonderland. Please, SquareEnix."

JRPG,3d0k4u,Casposaurus,10,Sun Jul 12 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's synonymous with JRPGs.  That said, I think part of the issue is that there are really two kinds of grinding that JRPGs can include.  First, there's grinding levels (or their equivalent) in order to power up your party just to progress with the main story.  With rare exceptions, don't think this has been necessary for a long time, though it was pretty common in the NES era.  These days, few if any JRPGs require grinding to get through the main story.  Even the SMT games, which are quite difficult by today's low standards, are more high variance than outright difficult, so you can usually win just by reshuffling your party and/or trying a few times.    Second, there's grinding associated with side content.  In contrast to the first type of grinding, this was basically non-existent in early JRPGs (partially due to there simply being less side content, but even to the extent that there was side content in the SNES/NES eras it rarely required or even encouraged much grinding), but has become increasingly common.  For an extreme example, take the hundreds (probably thousands) of hours of running grottos and repeatedly fighting the legacy bosses that it would take to fully outfit your party in DQ9 and level the legacy bosses to 100.  Of course, doing that is not required, but as a player who likes to be challenged, it bothers me quite a bit when the biggest in-game challenges are behind a giant grind-wall.  Even capturing all the monsters to fully unlock the monster arena in FFX is pushing and probably slightly exceeding the upper boundary of how much of a time sink side content should be, at least in my opinion.  So, I think the idea that JRPGs involve a lot of grinding is a combination of different types of people looking at different types of things.  First, you have people who don't bother to figure out how to play efficiently and/or who throw in the towel and decide they need to grind after even a single game-over, so they believe they need to grind levels even in modern JRPGs.  Second, you have people whose idea of a JRPG is still inexorably bound up with their experience playing early games like DQ2 or 7th Saga, which really did require significant level grinding at times.  Third, you have people who are completionists and want to do all the side quests, and are commonly finding it to be a huge grindfest in modern JRPGs.  Add those up, and there's a lot of different ways people could come to equate JRPGs with grinding."
JRPG,3d0k4u,EmperorHuoHu,3,Sun Jul 12 15:05:25 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. My original post was definitely ignoring the fact that people can grind for things other than EXP.   I mentioned in another comment that grinding for gold (or other resources like AP in Final Fantasy IX) is a thing I completely ignored.   Then, like you said, you've got side-content, which can be a grind in a different sense, but still something you could consider a 'grind'.   I definitely think I'd need to define 'grinding', and then cover all instances, instead of just sectioning it off to EXP.   I really appreciate the comment. You have no idea how much you've helped my video."
JRPG,3d0k4u,sheepcat87,7,Sun Jul 12 15:35:45 2015 UTC,Grinding for a level or two to move on feels nice. Grinding for 50 levels or 10 billion gold is not.
JRPG,3d0k4u,sheepcat87,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:56 2015 UTC,"DISGAEA INTENSIFIES  I agree though. I like grinding in small increments, where I can see a short-term pay-off. Even in games that move really quickly like Disgaea, grinding isn't a crippling experience."
JRPG,3d0k4u,AGuyFromRio,3,Mon Jul 13 06:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yea Disgaea pulled it off for sure. It wasn't ""gain 100 levels, each taking as long as the last"" it was more like ""gain some levels, start back over, gain those levels back super fast, abuse a particular map a few hundred times"" and boom you were level eight billion."
JRPG,3d0k4u,AGuyFromRio,2,Mon Jul 13 06:08:05 2015 UTC,"YEAH! I was trying to explain the process to a friend before, and I summed it up as ""Disgaea isn't about playing a game. It's about finding the quickest way to the level cap, and then repeating that process until you can take end-game bosses.""  Somehow, it manages to be, and remain, incredibly fun"
JRPG,3d0k4u,BobCrosswise,3,Mon Jul 13 12:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Grinding is a feature in most jrpgs.  I have been playing since the early 90's and from what I recall, I always ground. At least a bit, whether for gold or XP.   Of course some have more, some less. But it's always there. And if you are addicted like I was, you will grind until your chars are all at max level :p"
JRPG,3d0k4u,BobCrosswise,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a feature in most, but would you say a majority of games require grinding to progress?  I also didn't consider that people could grind for resources that were not EXP, like in FFIX, where grinding for AP is a thing, or Gold/Gil/Macca/whatever else in other games."
JRPG,3d0k4u,samuraigaiden,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"It depends on the game. Dragon quest VIII is grind - must,  because it's too damn hard if you are low level and badly equipped   Chrono Trigger,  on the other hand, is optional to grind. You just adjust your play style."
JRPG,3d0k4u,darthreuental,3,Sun Jul 12 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with your overall point, at least broadly - grinding is not necessarily synonymous with JRPGs, and I'd say it is generally the case that it's not really necessary - it just makes it easier.  The most obvious exceptions, IMO, would be games in which grinding is a deliberate part of the game - Summon Night: Swordcraft Story, for instance.  That said, I think that restarting is more tedious than grinding, so if it's a case in which it won't be enough to just be a smart player and use good strategies - if I have to keep restarting and trying things at random until I work out the one combination of weapons/items/buffs/spells that will work - then nothing has been gained.  I might as well have just spent that time grinding instead."
JRPG,3d0k4u,RevRay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a spectacular point. I think testing things comes down to knowing your characters, so it wouldn't be random, but based on a familiarity with the characters you've built, and played with for the past X hours.  Still a great point though."
JRPG,3d0k4u,RevRay,3,Mon Jul 13 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'm thinking of situations in which the only way to beat a boss at the level you'll be at if you don't grind is if you make one of your characters some specific specialty class and equip him with some specific weapon, then make some other faster character some other specific specialty class so he can cast some specific buff on the fighter on the first turn, and so on.  If it's something that can be worked out just from knowing how to handle your fighters and mages and healers and how to take advantage of elemental weaknesses or weapon types or whatever's appropriate to the game, then I'm mostly okay with that, and I wouldn't really count that as ""random.""  It's those ""Make Tom a Sword Knight and equip him with the Ugly Knife, which says it only does 2 points of damage but actually has the hidden ability to do 6,000 points of damage to opponents with three horns and one eye, and make Mary a Flower Wizard so that she can cast Take Root on Tom, which negates the Staple Beast's Flying Fear attack, then on the first turn have Jonah steal the Staple Beast's Fang (restart if he doesn't successfully steal it), then have Edie..."" blah blah blah.  If it's that complicated, I count that as effectively ""random.""  Or more accurately, unless I read a walkthrough, I'm only going to hit on that exact combination of things randomly."
JRPG,3d0k4u,trendkill14,3,Mon Jul 13 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"If you look back at the genre's earliest days, JRPGs began as grind heavy games. The first Dragon Quest is just one long grind, with only one character and virtually no strategy. Since then JRPGs have evolved and there are numerous examples of games that require no grinding, or even where grinding is simple not possible, like Chrono Cross. But there are still many JRPGs that have grinding as part of their core game mechanic. Arguably the most popular JRPG series in existence, Pokemon has a lot of grinding. So it's understandable that the genre is associated with grinding.   We should also ask why JRPGs are designed this way in the first place, and to answer that it's important to remember that the genre in Japan was born with accessibility in mind. In interviews, Hori and Sakaguchi both have referenced the idea that JRPGs were catering to players who were not good at, felt intimidated by or just didn't like the pure gameplay action games that were 90% of videogames in the 80s. In this context, grinding should be seen as a way to guarantee that even the less skilled players can progress in the game.   So, in essence, grinding is OK, but JRPG fans should try to spread the word about how strategically deep the better modern JRPGs are and how only skill and intelligence should be enough to beat that boss fight if you didn't actively avoid combat getting there.   TLTR> Grinding is part of the genre's history. JRPGs are cool."
JRPG,3d0k4u,ace_hunt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:52:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is a point I'm going to make in my video. Grinding grants a certain level of accessibility that you don't really see in other genres. We're all playing at the same difficulty (as most JRPGs don't have difficulty settings, and it's a really recent trend), and we're all given the same tools, regardless of whether or not we need them.   In that sense, JRPGs have evolved to become one of the most accessible genres, but misconceptions over what 'grinding' is generally turns people off.   Since I love JRPGs more than any other genre, that hurts me to see such a spectacular array of games be pushed to the side. I need to inform the masses. I MUST LET THEM KNOW THE TRUTH!"
JRPG,3d0k4u,smellslikekimchi,3,Mon Jul 13 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"I love smart grinding.   By this, I like games that reward the player for grinding. The best example of this includes games like Disgaea where grinding smart (utilizing the right stages) is something that is rewarded. With the later games in the series, I feel like the player is rewarded for 'gaming the system'. Another JRPG I'd use as an example of smart grinding would be Tales of Graces F where you get better rewards for turning up the difficulty. You also can unlock new titles etc. by grinding not to mention earning more grade points towards unlocking Game+ rewards."
JRPG,3d0k4u,Jamaz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"I think Star Ocean: Till The End of Time has a similar thing with difficulty and rewards, and I really like that. I wish more games would do it. It's generally reserved for Western RPGs, like Diablo and whatnot.  I think Digital Devil Saga, Final Fantasy IX, and the awful Agarest series get it right, where you don't just battle for EXP and Gold, you also destroy enemies in the quest for a third/fourth resource. Mantra, AP, and whatever the shit the Agarest series uses has you pilfering from the corpses of foes add to auxiliary abilities and character builds.  In that regard, I also think Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter was great with the ""EXP Bank"", but let's not devolve to complimenting Dragon Quarter."
JRPG,3d0k4u,Kindara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:43 2015 UTC,"Hey now, I loved Dragon Quarter. I never got around to beating it because my PS2 died, but such a challenging and unique game.  Of course, I hated it when I first bought it because I had no idea what the fuck was going on with the dragon counter."
JRPG,3d0k4u,superange128,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"It is really unique and challenging, but playing through it 3-4 times to get to the end ruined it for me.   I'd love to cover it in a video, and absolutely destroy the bad parts, but also talk about what it did really well."
JRPG,3d0k4u,daffodilambrosia,3,Mon Jul 13 13:50:33 2015 UTC,"I used to love grinding. I did all kinds of grinding in FFVI, VII and IX to learn the best skills for my favorite party members. Same of BoFIII and the masters with their skill increases.  These days, I have less time to play, and my main goal is to experience a solid story with solid gameplay. Its one of the reasons I love the XIII series. No grinding required but no lack of strategy. Plus, you can restart any battle you fail without having to go back to a save you made what feels like ages ago. I love to play old games but they're definitely outdated and my least favorite part is dying and having to work through an extinct game model to get back to where I was.   I beat games with as little grinding as possible these days. Ni No Kuni, FFXIII and XIII-2, Lost Odyssey (even though I ended up hating the game), Eternal Sonata. All of those were beatable without grinding. I love old school classic rpgs but new RPGs tend to be my favorites to playthrough now because I never feel the need to grind."
JRPG,3d0k4u,beigemore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:15:34 2015 UTC,"Replaying sequences you've already played as a punishment is a different discussion, but it definitely seems to be phasing out as time goes on. All hail Shovel Knight.  I do agree that it's significantly less tolerable in JRPGs, as shit can be really lengthy, but I don't agree that it's 'extinct' by any definition of the word. ""Less than ideal"" maybe, or ""in need of improvement"", but ""extinct""? No way.  Grinding is definitely something people become less tolerant to as they age, and a lot of newer JRPGs don't demand grinding (which is amazing), but I'm of the mind that most JRPGs don't require it. I wasn't a big NES RPG player, but SNES and onward, it's rare to see something that actually demands grinding.   Does it help? Absolutely. Is it absolutely necessary? I personally don't think so, but some disagree, and they've put forth some really good cases."
JRPG,3d0k4u,triforce721,2,Mon Jul 13 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"Here's 2 opposite sides, and I loved them both - 7th saga had absurd grinding and was fantastic. Suikoden 2 had No grinding and was fantastic."
JRPG,3d0k4u,RevRay,2,Sun Jul 12 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"I don't even mind grinding, because I love games like Disgaea and whatnot, but I definitely think it has negative connotations, and it's used as a blanket to cover all JRPGs. I want to change that. I WANT TO MANIPULATE MINDS!"
JRPG,3d0k4u,RevRay,2,Mon Jul 13 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think grinding is necessary in most JRPGs.  I've been watching a lot of speedruns lately and it's amazing what some of them can do at relatively low levels.  I know some of the strategy involves stepcounting and glitch exploitation, but the games are still doable with the correct strategy. Although I love grinding and being overpowered for boss fights, I don't think it's required."
JRPG,3d0k4u,DecemberFlame,2,Sun Jul 12 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the consensus of people who are familiar with JRPGs. I think grinding is definitely a misconception, but still present. IT'S SOMEHOW BOTH.  Also, seeing people beat FFIX at level 4 or something crazy like that blew my mind."
JRPG,3d0k4u,DecemberFlame,2,Mon Jul 13 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"Playing as many JRPGs as I have, I dont' feel like they are synonymous but I do feel like people automatically assume a connection. I've been playing JRPG's since the NES days and there was definitely a lot of grinding back then. I didn't mind it when I was younger, but as I got older I felt like time was more precious so I prefer to not have to grind to progress a story.  Some people actually enjoy the grind though. I think the perfect solution is a fast forward mode similar to Bravely Default. It still required some grinding but speeding through it was so satisfying. I hope more developers implement this into their JRPGs because it helps, a lot."
JRPG,3d0k4u,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I remember sinking 300~ hours of just grinding into Disgaea 2 and 3, and I'm not a busy person, but finding time for that now would be impossible. I found it really fun, because it was quick. Things were always moving, and always happening. A lot of progress in a very small amount of time, which is what I think Bravely Default has done as well."
JRPG,3d0k4u,Daverost,2,Mon Jul 13 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I hate grinding, but I find that almost every RPG (J or W) never requires it since games in general are catered to casual players and are afraid to make them fail. When I think about any newer JRPG, grinding isn't the first thing that comes to mind at all - I haven't had to grind since PS1.  And I actually love games that provide bosses that aren't supposed to be but can be defeated at an early level; Kingdom Hearts (if it can be considered a JRPG) is one of my favorites at this since every boss is designed to be defeatable at level 1. Dark Souls (WRPG) does this as well, and I love them for it. Grinding can be completely disregarded for a much greater challenge."
JRPG,3d0k4u,Daverost,2,Mon Jul 13 11:24:11 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts is totally a JRPG. I personally count Dark Souls as a JRPG as well, but it's clearly derived from conventional Western design, so I get why it's referred to as a WRPG.   That sort of style is almost exclusive to action RPGs, which is a bit unfortunate. You have the ability to physically manipulate your character, so stats aren't the defining element. There aren't many turn-based RPGs like that, but I'd love to see it explored more."
JRPG,3d0k4u,Danimals847,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:32:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of JRPGs nowadays have difficulty settings that cater to grinding honestly.  As someone who's been a fan as long as you have, I actually still enjoy grinding to this day.  It has been and will most likely always be really fulfilling to power the shit out of my character before going into some epic boss fight.  There are certain games I really enjoy grinding in, namely the SMT series since you have demon fusion, and the Dragon Quest Monsters series for similar reasons.  Then there are games like FF where I dread grinding.  So, for me, it's dependent on both the battle system and the RPG element the game presents for me to be able to enjoy grinding in said game."
JRPG,3d0k4u,magmafanatic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I enjoy grinding in SMT as well. I think it's because the higher level my demons are, the more I can get from fusing them. Plus, extra Macca makes fusion a lot more interesting.   As for FF, I think the only FF game that really needs grinding is FFIX for Ability Points. Items rotate so fast, and new items are acquired all the time, so it's hard to justify the stat-difference for a few abilities."
JRPG,3d0k4u,magmafanatic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:36:39 2015 UTC,It exists in some  I vastly prefer games that dont require grinding  It probably should be kept optional at least for people who do like grindibg

Instead of being the generic good guy trying to kill the bad guy and save the world, he is an actual human being that takes the feelings of others into consideration and tries to understand both sides of the fight."

JRPG,3d1bj7,CSFFlame,2,Mon Jul 13 03:34:02 2015 UTC,I actually liked Aurica quite a lot over the whole course of the game. It was easy to see she'd get a good deal of character growth and Lyner was a good support for her if you chose Aurica's path.

Going by the CD key format of 5 sets of 5, strictly numerals, you have significantly more potential keys than there are living humans.  They literally just need to generate the next valid key in the sequence and send it to you to deliver a copy of their product to you.

They want you to prepurchase their game to inflate their day one sales numbers whether it turns out to be a quality product or not.  It's sleazy.

JRPG,3csobg,ffxivthrowaway03,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, way to totally miss the point entirely.  In the rest of the whole world, you don't give someone money for a product until they can provide that product.  Preorders started being a thing because the publishers wanted to stir up hype and when physical copies were the only distribution method it both helped them get enough copies to stores to meet demand and let the purchaser guarantee they would get a copy on day one.  Literally none of those things apply to digital distribution, yet they're still hocking preorders like if you don't preorder RIGHT NOW you wont get a copy!!!  It's bullshit marketing, and they're intentionally creating a knee jerk reaction that you have to buy it now!!! or you might not get it.  How many times have we seen it in the past few years that publishers have blatantly said ""if this gets a lot of preorders then maaaaybe we'll localize the next one.""  It's manipulative and we just keep eating it up.   I mean, I hope you're joking there.    And no, I'm not.  Literally no other business gets to say ""we'll get people to decide they want to buy it before we even commit to making it, and if the numbers aren't as big as we'd like, we'll just cancel the project.""  Creating any product is a risk.  You make the product, then you sell it to people, thats honest business.  You don't maybe make a product if enough people buy it from you first."

Or maybe if you don't care about the topic, instead of telling me that I need to stop talking about it with other people, you can just be an adult and scroll past it?"
JRPG,3csobg,mundozeo,4,Sat Jul 11 11:34:44 2015 UTC,"So by this logic, Kick starter shouldn't even exist right?  I mean, asking people for money to make something and then doing it if enough people agree it's something they would pay for. By your logic people in Kick starter should set up the funds from their own pocket, then sell the product and hope it sells well enough to recover the investment.  Have you ever tried to produce something yourself?"
JRPG,3csobg,ffxivthrowaway03,0,Fri Jul 10 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"Kickstarter as it stands shouldn't exist.  How many people have been completely scammed by BS kickstarters with absolutely no recourse to get their money back?  Enough that Kickstarter needed to do their best to make a futile attempt to put (completely unenforceable) rules in place against it.  None of those projects are liable for a single penny of that money if the product never gets made due to mismanagement, lack of funds, or anything else.  So if someone pitches their idea on kickstarter, gets their $200,000 in funding, then goes out and buys a pair of Ferraris instead of making a product out of it, every single one of those backers forfeit all of their consumer protections and is totally fucked out of their money.  So yeah, I'm sorry, but ""hey everyone, give me money!"" is not a business model, and it shifts ALL the risk onto the consumer."

JRPG,3csobg,mundozeo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"It might be related to this:    If a bundle includes an in-game item or DLC that is not refundable, Steam will tell you if the whole bundle is refundable during check-out.

JRPG,3csobg,zaviex,3,Fri Jul 10 19:40:46 2015 UTC,thats not true anymore. CDPR is huge. The team that made the Witcher 3 was bigger than the team that made Dragon Age Inquisition. 180 employees for DA:I and 300+ for the witcher 3
JRPG,3csobg,ACardAttack,4,Fri Jul 10 21:38:22 2015 UTC,the witcher 3 also went as low as fucking 28 dollars on sale before release. I mean... come on. I will pre-order any triple A game that drops below 30 at release. GMG keeps coming through.
JRPG,3csobg,zaviex,2,Fri Jul 10 21:36:08 2015 UTC,"It went that low?  Wow, I payed around 50, no shame though, went to a developer I want to support"

GMG being a well known retailer came out, said they didnt get any so they paid retail and they were pretty much subsidizing them out of pocket down to 35 which was 28 with one of their coupons. So in the end my 28 dollars went the same amount towards the dev as full price."

JRPG,3csobg,Deksloc,14,Sat Jul 11 10:44:07 2015 UTC,"Guys, be careful when pre-ordering games on the PC. They're usually very buggy on launch day, and JRPGs are known for lazy port jobs- it's generally better to wait for reviews before actually purchasing just due to the issues PC versions usually have (optimization, customization, controller support, etc)"
JRPG,3csobg,Tarul,12,Fri Jul 10 14:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think in this case, you're better off pre-ordering if there's even a chance you want Tales of Zestiria. You get a free copy of Symphonia (at the rate it's increasing, it's pretty much a lock), and some DLC. If Zestiria ends up being poorly ported or whatever, you can just return it through Steam. Waiting a while for reviews will result in a loss of both of those things, whereas it's not actually risky to pre-order."
JRPG,3csobg,jamvng,6,Fri Jul 10 14:51:55 2015 UTC,thats why im preordering. $50 for both tales games. even if it's bad at launch ill just play other games and wait until it's fixed or refund it.
JRPG,3csobg,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"I would also like to point out that many online retailers put pre-orders on sale the closer it gets to release date. Green Man Gaming, for instance did this for Valkyria Chronicles  Additionally, we don't even know if Tales of Symphonia will have a good port job either! I'm saying that you can't buy it, but that it's smarter to just wait til closer to release date so that more info is released on the port, and the prices for pre-ordering are cheaper (usually 20%+ discount)"
JRPG,3csobg,mundozeo,3,Fri Jul 10 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"If you buy from other retailers though, you lose out on Steam refunds."
JRPG,3csobg,ryuzaki49,2,Fri Jul 10 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Most outlets have a best price guarantee though.  If its offered for a lesser price before they actually charge you, they either credit you the difference automatically or you can just ring up customer support."
JRPG,3csobg,Tarul,2,Fri Jul 10 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"Smarter even would be to simply stay away and wait for a discount down to 5 dollars, heck maybe even a bundle some day.  It's all up to the individual if they want the game so much or if they simply want to pay. I would never pre order a game like civilization since I'm simply not into it, but I'm preordering this in a heartbeat since Tales is one of my favorite series of all time and I want to get it on my hands as soon as possible."
JRPG,3csobg,mundozeo,4,Fri Jul 10 21:27:00 2015 UTC,But... but... free copy of Tales of Symphonia
JRPG,3csobg,allyallniggasisgay,6,Fri Jul 10 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"The game is $10 on the PS3. It's not really worth dealing with the possibility of a crappy port. Also, if you really want the bonus, just wait until right before the game comes it out. By then, you should have heard if the game is good (no reviews is an immediate red flag), and can still pre-order for the bonus.  Also, ToS is coming out in 2016, so it's not really an immediate benefit either."
JRPG,3csobg,VintageSin,2,Sat Jul 11 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"But I don't have a PS3 and I REALLY want to play Zesteria regardless of what the reviews say, I love the series.  True, Symphonia will arrive late but it'll be there in my library when it does with no added cost!"
JRPG,3csobg,hayashirice911,2,Sun Jul 12 08:52:27 2015 UTC,"The one thing that makes me feel like it'd be kinda safe to do the preorder is Steam's new refund policy (which is why they implemented it).  http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds   Refunds on Pre-Purchased Titles  When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game’s release date.   I'm usually pretty patient with games, so I rarely pre-order. This seems like an okay time to make an exception, as I'd like to send a strong signal like ""hey, more Tales games on PC please"", and this preorder accomplishes that. I may be a bit of an outlier in that I probably won't be playing a ton right away (because backlogs), so I won't have to worry about the two hour limit. That gives me 14 days to skim reviews and do a quick test to make sure it'll run smoothly. If it doesn't look good, I can opt for the refund and send another signal (""I won't pay for it if you don't port it properly"").  If this wasn't a ""testing the waters"" game release I'd probably wait to see reviews, and probably wait for sale (even with the Symphonia preorder bonus -- I don't need that much Tales on my PC right away). But that can't happen until publishers realize that the PC is a good platform to sell games on. Really, I just want to throw some money behind the ""Tales on PC"" idea."
JRPG,3csobg,Zakwee,2,Sat Jul 11 12:38:33 2015 UTC,Namco is pretty bad with ports in general. When they required  Ds 1 to be ported from soft literally shit the bed on the port. It was good with a gamepad though. So there is that.

JRPG,3csobg,Terminia,2,Fri Jul 10 17:27:07 2015 UTC,"It's only moved up by 1%, which seems pretty small assuming that more people might be digging in to preorder with the more interesting reward being on the line.   I wouldn't be surprised if the threshold was much higher, like an order of magnitude higher. The reward on the line would be quite a lot pricier, after all; very few people really care about costume DLC, but Symphonia is actually kind of enticing. Money-wise, if they give the DLC for free they're not missing out on that much income (a few bucks?) compared to giving away an entire game (~$20, based on PS3 prices?), especially considering that the DLC wouldn't be as popular."

What's the downside of preordering in this case though? you get great games (heck even just the main game seems worth it), you support JRPGs on steam, and if the port sucks you can refund (which I assume will take away both games). Heck, if it gets patches after you refunded it you can buy it again with your refund!  I'm really not seeing what people have against this particular preorder case."
JRPG,3csobg,Ghopper101,3,Fri Jul 10 21:31:16 2015 UTC,You don't want to encourage Namco to release crappy ports on the PC because it's free money for them. They need to earn our money with due effort; they don't simply deserve it.
JRPG,3csobg,mundozeo,3,Sat Jul 11 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"How is it free money when customers can easily get a refund if it sucks due to low/no effort? Did you read up on the Arkham Knight debacle? Due to the massive amounts of refunds, the publisher had to PULL the game out of the Steam storefront (while still honoring refunds). If anything, a massive preorder and then refund will show Namco that there is a huge amount of potential profit...but only if they put in the effort to make a good port."
JRPG,3csobg,Ghopper101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"Because simply put, there's a non-trivial amount of people who are going to preorder it six months out, forget when it actually releases because it's been six months and it's not top of mind, and then sail beyond the refund period.  They're banking on that the same way as Gamestop banks on all the people who pay in full to preorder a physical copy then never pick it up in the 48 hour window.  They get to resell it, and pad their quarterly numbers without moving physical products by selling products that aren't even technically for sale yet.  In an industry where day-one sales are literally what decides if a game is considered a success or a failure, getting those numbers up by any means necessary is what they do, massive refund or day two patch or whatever.  Not to mention that preordering continues to support the preorder culture of developers, which is by its very nature designed to take advantage of the consumer.  Even if this particular preorder is a good deal, the more people buy into it the more it encourages and supports developers to care more about preorder numbers than making quality products that will sell well after they are released.  Vegans don't buy steaks just because they're on sale that week, y'know?"
JRPG,3csobg,FreeIceCreen,2,Sun Jul 12 13:34:52 2015 UTC,"Look, I get where you are coming from and pre-Steam refund update I would have agreed with you wholeheartedly.  The non-trivial amount of people you speak of is being implied to go ahead and preorder anyway, right? These people don't care about their money and don't monitor their spending. Yes it isn't nice that companies have this nick and dime attitude but at the end of the day they are businesses seeking to make a profit. That however is digressing the point.   Again, I will refer back to Arkham Knight situation. They had lots of sales numbers sure, but the outrage at the poor port is everywhere. That really does not paint a success in any way. I don't quite get what you are trying to say with your point about doing whatever they can do get those numbers up. If the game is broken but then fixed, then you got the product you paid for. If the game is broken and not fixed, the refunds start happening. This leads back to refunds negating these negative results. High sales numbers but equivalently high refund rate is not a commercial success. That's basically a lost sale.  Why do preorder numbers matter when it's an easily lost sale? Maybe I'm misunderstanding you right now (it's 12 pm and I haven't slept since yesterday 4pm), but I don't see how it's still a problem with refunds. I'd love to learn something that I might be missing out on the bigger picture."

I'd love to learn something that I might be missing out on the bigger picture.   Because Steam is not the only digital distribution platform in the world, and Steam hasn't even been giving refunds for more than a month after how many years of it being an issue.  Even then, there are specific requirements (less than x hours played, must be within y days of the original purchase) to qualify for a refund.  Regardless, the distributor shouldn't have to be the one stepping in to make things fair to the consumer.  Part of being a publisher in any industry is assuming a certain amount of risk.  The very reason publishers exist in the first place is to oversee the manufacturer (the development studio in this case) to ensure a quality product is released and in turn the consumers feel more comfortable buying the product because it has a bigger name standing behind it.  Part of the reason the indie scene has been taking the video games industry by storm over the past 10 years is specifically because publishers as a whole have strayed from their actual purpose and are now mostly just yet another unnecessary exploitative middleman.  They fuck over the developers AND the consumers both.   Again, I will refer back to Arkham Knight situation.   And if it wasn't a super popular Batman game that literally didn't function, would we ever have heard a word about it?  For every Arkham Knight fiasco there's how many more where the publisher pushed ""preorder, preorder, preorder"", it turned out to be a mediocre game, and they didn't care one bit because they got the day one sales to make them top the charts for the week.  And why do they care about those preorders?  Because even if it's a flop, if their game is at the top of this weeks charts there's going to be plenty of people that don't do any research and buy it blindly thinking it must be good because it's at the top of the charts.  Which further emphasizes the pressure on developers to push it out the door and fix it later.  The potential for lost sales due to refunds is worth much less than the marketing potential of initial sales figures.  So yeah, buying into the preorder hype just continues to perpetuate an industry culture that sucks for everyone but big publishers.  Hell, even physical collectors editions aren't truly ""limited editions"" anymore.  I can still purchase the FFXIII collectors edition directly from Square Enix for regular old retail price, and how many years ago was that released?  And all it takes to get us to forget that and buy into it is Free DLC costumes."

You even included another one of my all-time favorites, Illusion of Gaia. Thank you for the nod to SMT and Persona, I hope you get the chance to do your in-depth look they're really worth the time. You are yet another who has convinced me I need to try Grandia. I'm still not sure how I missed that one back in the day..."
JRPG,3cu72m,underpantsviking,2,Fri Jul 10 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"The game is great. Its lack of story is laughable, though.  There will never be another game like it, thats for sure."

JRPG,3cu72m,DarthNarcissa,2,Sat Jul 11 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"Nice video, we share a lot of the same opinions. Like Grandia being greatly under-rated and FFVI being the best RPG (Always dreamed of it getting a live action movie makeover like LoTR style) but I would have added the ""Tales of"" series in place of the Quintet trilogy, but it's all personal taste and nostalgia there...  I can't help but wonder what game is at 0:54~?"
JRPG,3cu72m,ReallySuperBest,2,Sat Jul 11 00:00:43 2015 UTC,"0:54 is kind of a transition, so either Secrets of Grindea (with the big green slime) or Hoshigami (looks kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics) I also love the Tales Series."
JRPG,3cu72m,Rascyc,2,Sat Jul 11 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"I never understand why people like Grandia 1's combat system when you can attack/heal through the entire game.  Doing anything else just slows you down because most of the utility abilities are bad, so combat is just dreadfully easy."

I like that you had FF as #4, but would prefer it not to be in the top 10. I've see the same JRPG's in top 10s over and over. Most often than not, I've played all the series in a top 10, and looking for something new."
JRPG,3cu72m,Blissfulystoopid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:13:58 2015 UTC,"There are parts of this list I enjoy and agree with, and like any list ever, parts I disagree with.  If I may make a constructive criticism, you should really explain more and go slower. You speak very quickly and devote less than a few seconds to most items on the list. I think your opinions would come through stronger if you offered a bit more detail in your explanations and contextualized your choice of each franchise by explaining what they have contributed to the genre as a whole.   It's hard to get a feel for any of the games on here I haven't played, and it's hard to understand any of the choices without that context. Especially since some franchises were placed or left out based admittedly on personal preference with no real explanation (Why does Persona not feel iconic to jrpgs despite its massive history? As someone who hasn't played Grandia but is interested, what makes it so good? You don't really explain why.  It's a decent list and I like your editing of clips into it, but I hope this helps a little! Just wanted to be a little constructive since it felt like something was missing!"
JRPG,3cu72m,doyleredlandxx,2,Sat Jul 11 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like maybe explain what they bring to the table.  Like Shadow Hearts is my favorite because of the interesting battle system that made timing autoattacks really interesting, as well as the stats around the ring which I found fun.  Or Chrono was really awesome at fulfilling the fantasy of a time travelling adventure with its many endings and non linear nature.  Y was really awesome because it was the first RPG series to have after-story content in the form  of epic boss battles.  Shit like that?"

JRPG,3cu72m,gamesterx23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your #1.  If compared, side-by-side, to every JRPG out there - Grandia 1 & 2 stick out like sore thumbs. The character development is top notch, the Voice Acting is actually quite good in that it gets the point across (see melfice battle Grandia 2,) the soundtracks are jawdropping (thanks Noriyuki <3,) and the battle system is like none other. The games are also bright,colorful, fluid and super easy on the eyes.  Ubisoft tried to piggyback off of the awesome battle engine in Child of Light and obviously failed hard. I want to make my own RPG one day with an improved or slightly modified version of the Grandia battle engines."
JRPG,3cu72m,Blissfulystoopid,3,Sat Jul 11 00:09:38 2015 UTC,"Just curious as someone who hasn't played Grandia, why do you say Child of Light failed hard? While easy, I found its battle system really enjoyable and absolutely adored it's fairytale aesthetic, art style, and soundtrack."
JRPG,3cu72m,gamesterx23,0,Sat Jul 11 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I'm not really in a position to give it proper judgement, but I'm bitter about the fact that Ubisoft basically touted the supposed ""fact"" that it had a Grandia Style battle system when they would talk about the game (Before its release.)   It definitely piqued my interest . . . until I saw that the battle system is an extremely stripped down version of the Grandia Battle system . . . so stripped down that you really, honestly, cannot even say it is Grandia-styled.  I'm not saying Child of Light is a bad game. It looks mediocre to me, but I haven't played it yet so I can't really be sure. All I can do is ask you to play a few hours of Grandia 2 so you can get a feel for the battle system. It truly is something else."
JRPG,3cu72m,YourFavAnon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you should play Child of Light before saying it's just straight up bad. IMO of course, it was one of the more enjoyable titles that came out last year. Not overly long, solid story, interesting atmosphere to it. Combat and character progression was actually pretty interesting and entertaining, and this is as a person who's a fan of the Grandia series. Grab it when it's on sale on steam the next time it comes around."
JRPG,3cu72m,gamesterx23,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"I never once claimed it was bad, I said it looks mediocre to me.

I'm all for a good story, but I prefer a package deal and usually favor gameplay - > story."
JRPG,3csymm,chickdigger802,13,Fri Jul 10 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with yes, you're probably the only one who feels that way.  I didn't love the presentation of Xillia, mostly because I played Milla's story first and didn't have time to go back and play through Jude's to get the big chunks of stuff that was exclusive to each.  But the game itself was pretty solid for a Tales game.  I liked Xillia 2 even more.  Graces F was kind of meh, but considering it was a port of a Wii game, you kind of get what you pay for on that one.  It was already a watered down game to begin with.  Personally, my absolute favorite was Abyss, but that doesn't mean later entries have been bad at all."
JRPG,3csymm,ffxivthrowaway03,3,Fri Jul 10 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"For Xillia, I have to agree. My roommate and I played the Milla story just because ""she's hot"", and I was definitely happy with the game, but replaying through Jude's story helped a lot with my perception of the game's story."

JRPG,3csymm,renatomunhozz,3,Fri Jul 10 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"I'm playing through ToX2 at this moment. 40hs into the game, I'm playing at my pace - doing a lot of side-quests, specially the character-focused ones. Really they are really worth it. Besides the fact that the original cast from ToX1 is what really shines here, you also get a lot of extra scenes during the main story if you complete their side-quests first.  So I don't mind the debt system, nor the pace of the story. But as someone who really loved the world of Xillia, taking my time there is just what I wanted from the game. The only problem for me was the semi-silent main character. The dialogue options are interesting and all, but I would never take that in place of a full fleshed out, voiced character. But this is not something bad, it's just not my personal taste (that's the main reason I never got into western RPGs)."
JRPG,3csymm,mreiland,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:49:50 2015 UTC,nailed my feelings about it exactly and I'm 30 hours in I think?
JRPG,3csymm,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"My only real complaint is the pacing of the story.  Theres a short story segment, then a bunch of optional sidequests/hunts/character quests/etc, then another short story segment, etc.  If you do all the extra stuff, it puts a good chunk of time between story segments.  But you don't have to do all the extra stuff if you don't want, and even doing a small fraction of it more than covers the debt mechanic.  For reference, doing it all I was constantly pestered for having too much money the whole game, to the point where I was just throwing massive amounts of extra cash at the debt.  It never once impeded me from continuing the story.  The combat is a more polished version of Xillia, and the story is more mature than most tales games.  I'd put some scenes on par with certain presentations and questions of morality in Vesperia.  I can see why people didn't like it, especially if they strictly wanted to skip all the optional stuff and the fact that it deviates from the traditional Tales formula a little, but as a whole it was very enjoyable."
JRPG,3csymm,3nigmax,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"If you enjoyed Xillia, you will enjoy Xillia 2. Yes, they gated the story behind a system that requires you to do more side quests than would otherwise be totally necessary, but it's really not THAT intrusive. I could see it being annoying if you are trying to replay it just for the main story, or speed running it, or something, but otherwise, it felt like it was paced about as well as any other Tales game."
JRPG,3csymm,lunarstarslayer,4,Fri Jul 10 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with you in saying Vesperia was the pinnacle.  Each game has its own merits, though.  I've heard Hearts R is a standout."
JRPG,3csymm,3nigmax,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"Played Hearts R recently. The characters are a little more ""Anime"" than I have come to expect, even from a Tales game, but it was still very enjoyable. The battle system is also fantastic."
JRPG,3csymm,Tarul,4,Fri Jul 10 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"I feel ya. I posted my thoughts here, and a few people feel the same way. Tales games appeal to the JRPG fanbase, which quite frankly, are used to games made with shoe-string budgets. I would prefer if the devs were to step up their game and pump more money into them, but I don't see them benefiting too much from it. This is essentially an ""anime"" game with fun combat, and that's not going to appeal to the mass market ultimately."
JRPG,3csymm,3nigmax,3,Sat Jul 11 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"You probably aren't the only one, but you are likely in the minority. Personally, I haven't seen that much of a marketing push from them. They are definitely modernizing and working within their niche of being bigger/more recognizable than other random JRPGs while still being smaller than the big AAA franchises.   Maybe it's just a difference in your perception of the titles. I know a lot of people call Vesperia the pinnacle and what not, but it's really interesting to me that people think the games have gone downhill since then. Other than Graces, which was a Wii port, the game's have only continued to improve graphically (and I didn't think Graces looked bad at all). The battle systems, in my opinion, have continued to improve and I honestly thought that Vesperia's was surprisingly flat and lacked any overly interesting dynamics. I am also not really aware of controversies with each game. I haven't followed Zestiria too closely, but unless it's AI is spectacularly bad Tales games aren't really known for their groundbreaking party AI."
JRPG,3csymm,superange128,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:18:32 2015 UTC,While I like Vesperia I feel like people give it a bit too much credit for polish and not many interesting gimmicks (hell Symphonia had more interesting battle gimmicks) and Yuri Lowell (who is a great protag but still).  I think most modern Tales games stick out more in terms of battle dynamics and story than Vesperia
JRPG,3csymm,3nigmax,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I popped in Vesperia this week to refresh my memory since it had been a while. The game definitely has polish, especially the camera in cities being smooth and amazing. However, the story isn't anything amazing, and everyone besides Yuri is nothing special in my opinion. Also the battle system is soooooooo slow. Even Symphonia felt smoother and faster paced. Xillia and Graces, in my opinion, really made the battle system something special."
JRPG,3csymm,ForJRPGpost,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:44:00 2015 UTC,I feel like vesperia got praise because it is really the only modern tales that has the old style of start locked in get a boat then an airship and progress. Since then they have made the combat better but the overworld being replaced with linear uninteresting maps leading to your next actual dungeon/puzzle/town is boring for me. I want the locked in progression of stuck walking then a bridge gets fixed opens up some more world and all that.
JRPG,3csymm,ethernetcord,3,Wed Jul 15 02:09:10 2015 UTC,It's definitely been downhill since Vesperia polish wise.
JRPG,3csymm,no1babbydaddy,2,Sun Jul 12 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"The low quality of Xillia was due to them rushing out Xillia for the anniversary of Tales.... and I'm pretty sure it's only Xillia that has a air of ""lower quality"".  I'm pretty sure that's why they made a Xillia 2 in the first place. I still think it's a higher quality than most other more niche JRPGs, such as Record of Agarest War or Fairy Fencer F."
JRPG,3csymm,no1babbydaddy,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"zesteria apparently is a huge shit show. crap framerate, that controversy over one of the biggest characters in the marketing promotion 's main story quests are dlc. battle AI just plain don't work, terrible camera and other jazz, might make it the worst tales game since that ps2 one.   heck graces had a few huge game breaking bugs on wii."
JRPG,3csymm,hayashirice911,5,Fri Jul 10 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"From what I read on topics about the game, the framerate and camera wasn't nearly as bad as people made it out to be (also, there's the matter of it coming to PS4). The Battle AI isn't ever going to be good in an ARPG. I don't recall any Tales game with good party AI.   It isn't a ""shit show"". Reception for the game is positive. The biggest negative about the game would probably have to do with DLC. I haven't done any research on the Alisha DLC, but it wasn't a ""main story quest"". I still think the idea is completely ridiculous.  And Legendia wasn't a bad Tales game. I mean, I know everyone has their opinions and such, but nothing about it was all that offensive. It's still a charming game."

JRPG,3csymm,Electrium,2,Fri Jul 10 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"Well, Bandai Namco's marketing in the west isn't coming out of the same pot that is used to develop the games in Japan.  The games aren't really marketed that heavily, are they? Maybe they get magazine ads (ToX2 had a poster in Otaku USA), maybe some web ads (which are pretty cheap as far as advertising goes), but I don't think they're doing anything drastic at all. Compare that to Blizzard games, Destiny last year, Call of Duty, etc. TV commercials for months at a time in addition to way more web and print ads than Tales.  Are you sure you don't just personally feel overexposed? We all wish Tales games had a bigger budget, but you can't just pull money out of thin air. Like it or not advertising is a crucial part of getting people to buy your game, and having a marginally better game doesn't convert directly to sales in the way advertising does. ""But it will get better reviews!"" Well, reviews don't necessarily equal sales either, that's only a conversion tool for the small amount of people that even saw the game's reviews.  I dunno. I don't see Tales marketing as excessive. I think Destiny and Assassin's Creed have excessive marketing and are bad games but clearly those feelings are wrong as far as sales are concerned."
JRPG,3csymm,allyallniggasisgay,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"i know its irrational, and like you mention i feel irritated about other big marketing stuff like doritos/mt dew, or huge expensive CE for buggy games like fallout or boring stuff like CoD lol as well.  i guess its mostly  due to the unique status of Tales  titles in the west, as in pretty much being the only jrpg series that isn't final fantasy that still gets any coverage in mainstream websites, even though objectively its not really a 'higher tier' than your average recent jrpgs from koei, atlus, compile heart etc."
JRPG,3csymm,bendmorris,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, and I don't even think its irrational. People just get tired of hearing the same things over and over, nothing wrong with that. I'm down for more Tales since Zestiria is shaking things up more than the last few have, but I don't think anyone would be wrong for skipping since the series is kinda samey."
JRPG,3csymm,NavVasky,2,Sat Jul 11 01:12:32 2015 UTC,Not sure where these marketing efforts are. Tales game advertising has been pretty much on par with every other JRPG game as far as I can tell (i.e. zero) which is why I hang around here for some news on this stuff.   I might just be really good at avoiding ads and hype though.
JRPG,3csymm,Sychotics,2,Fri Jul 10 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"Put some of that money back into the game dev side pls.   I don't even...how do you think game development works? Do you think they have a meeting and say ""we'll take some of our development budget, and run a bunch of commercials for no reason, and just make the game a little shittier?""  They spend money on marketing to make money via increased sales. It's a business. That doesn't subtract from the money/effort they put into the game, it's completely independent."
JRPG,3csymm,potatoarmy,0,Sun Jul 12 07:40:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. But the games have definitely been more marketing controlled over the years. As in games quality is less relevant vs meeting deadlines or other stuff. Games have lowered in quality and stability each entry, so yes this isn't marketing fault. They are separate. Upper management should be to blame."
JRPG,3csymm,LoonyMoonie,2,Sun Jul 12 14:57:45 2015 UTC,You are missing his point.  By marketing big they expect to get an increase in sales and therefore increase/justify the budget for development for the next/current entry of the series.

The characters were interesting in the demo (mainly the 2.0 version with the whole camping thing) and the soundtrack is godly. I'm sure the game will looks amazing cause that's what Square was always good at.     Never played XB so i can't comment on X.     If you want more modern JRPGs to look forward to i suggest you look up Tales of Zestiria and Persona 5. They are also coming in 2015 so the wait is less aggravating :).

I hope the game draws a bit from 1 and 2 and calms down with the Social Links a bit. I like them but I like a slightly smaller cast with tighter connections and detail in their personality.

Even 7, a lot of people liked, then Squall was very polarizing(I still like him to this day). I can't really find too many people that didn't like Zidane. Then Tidus(One of the worst), Vaan(blank slate boring), Lightning(pretty great design and voice actor, but her personality was traaaaaash)."
JRPG,3cs5l2,HappierShibe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"I can't really find too many people that didn't like Zidane.   Here I am! I found Zidane really annoying and he would probably be my least favourite FF lead if Tidus didn't exist... Oh, wait..."
JRPG,3cs5l2,xerxes431,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"Tidus takes that fuckin cake. Everything about X was awesome except him, Yuna and the dogawful story. Music, combat and pretty much everything else was great."
JRPG,3cs5l2,xerxes431,4,Fri Jul 10 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade was great because it had a great cast and a fantastic story for me, Xenoblade X is more like a MMO from what my japanese speaking friends told me the story is forgettable and not very long and the focus is more on the quests and online interaction, dunno if i like that i probably would have preferred a more story driven game, the fetch quests and collection stuff wasn't exactly Xenoblades strong points in the first place and they are not very improved in Xenoblade X so it's like the focused on the worst aspects of Xenoblade. I doubt it will be as high regarded as the first game because of that and the reviews so far seem to reflect that.  As for FFXV honestly i don't care about it im not a fan of modern Square/Enix or Nomuras designs, neither the Character designs nor the game play appeals to me maybe i am just too old for it."
JRPG,3cs5l2,wallabingbing,3,Fri Jul 10 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"It's funny. I am actually happy to hear the story is shorter. If they go on too long they get boring or stale. Had no idea there was online interaction! That's awesome. Yeah, for me I don't mind the quests because I tend to get sucked into this world. So those random villages would probably need actual mundane things to be done. I totally understand why A LOT of people find it boring. I didn't care for the story of Xeno, but everything around it is fucking magical. That's why I'm psyched for an all new cast. I'm done with Shulk, give me another adventure in that place."
JRPG,3cs5l2,wallabingbing,2,Fri Jul 10 12:05:05 2015 UTC,"Really? I've heard that the biggest improvement from the original Xenobade are the quests. The production values of them are way better, and yes you still have the regular generic quests, but they're labeled as ""simple quests"" this time around so you don't really need to focus on them if you don't want to. Personally, I find questing and exploring extremely addicting and it's what I'm looking forward to the most.  As long as the characters and story aren't bad and unlikable, I'll be fine with it. Of course, I would've loved to have a story with as nice characters as Xenoblade."
JRPG,3cs5l2,wallabingbing,2,Fri Jul 10 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"maybe i am just too old for it.   I doubt it. Nomura seems like he's a decent designer when he's working with other people, and has some more varied input. When left to his own devices he seems to design the same 2 or 3 characters over and over again.    And they always have giant Mr T. chains and zippers for days."
JRPG,3cs5l2,wallabingbing,2,Fri Jul 10 14:18:29 2015 UTC,I think Dark Souls fits the bill as a modern classic
JRPG,3cs5l2,wallabingbing,3,Sat Jul 11 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Except its a western rpg made in Japan. Dark Souls is more action adventure, for me. I would personally rate Demon's and Bloodborne higher than either Dark title."
JRPG,3cs5l2,Electrium,3,Sat Jul 11 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't played bb. I find the story from ds1 better than des. And what makes it a western rpg? It is an rpg made in Japan with lots of common jrpg tropes. Honestly, jrpg is a terrible name for a genre."
JRPG,3cs5l2,wallabingbing,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"Gonna go ahead and need you to fill me in on the tropes the Souls series is full of that are found throughout Final Fantasy, Suikoden, SMT, Breath of Fire etc. If someone handed me Dank Souls and I had never heard of it or anything, I would think Western devs."
JRPG,3cs5l2,Zilveari,2,Sat Jul 11 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"I earnestly, truly hope for a strong, well-constructed and deep narrative from Final Fantasy XV. I am so sick of the faux-intellectualism from the FFXIII trilogy and the Kingdom Hearts series (with the exception of the first) - they try to sound mystical and mysterious and meaningful while not actually having any substance behind the words. If FFXV can give players a thoughtful narrative with thoughtful character arcs, I will forgive pretty much anything."
JRPG,3cs5l2,doyleredlandxx,2,Sat Jul 11 06:36:22 2015 UTC,"Convoluted and shallow masked as complex and deep. Got really sick of that with Square Enix titles outside of Dragon Quest. Here is hoping though, right!? Maybe the characters might be a bit more whimsical, like Radiata Stories or FF9."
JRPG,3cs5l2,bubblegummonkey1,3,Sat Jul 11 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"Well said - ""convolution"" is definitely their primary method of masking the bad storytelling.  I don't really see FFXV as having that whimsy of FFIX, although I certainly wouldn't be unhappy with such a game. They've stated that they are going for realism, and I just hope they really mean it when they say that. I'm not talking about being gritty or grimdark for the sake of it, but instead having characters who feel true and human, who actually feel big feelings with big consequences. In this case, I'm thinking of examples like Cloud (actually hates himself so much he grafts his hero's personality onto himself, a psychosis which we as players see get taken apart over time), Rinoa (forced to realize her own privilege and hypocrisy when it comes to ""fighting the man""), or Vivi (coming to terms with mortality and what basically amounts to a terminal illness), etc.  I don't want to see people like Snow (going on cartoonishly about how a ""hero"" is supposed to act), or bland, undeveloped relationships like Serah and Noel's (really... we got a guy and a girl traveling together and they are literally just buddies, and not even that close of buddies??). Basically I want to see them take some risks, and go deeper.  ... Sorry, I have a lot of feelings about this lol."
JRPG,3cs5l2,RimShimp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:19:02 2015 UTC,"Totally on the same page. The interactions in the recent FF titles have just been so boring and plastered on. Don't get me wrong, the older characters had these issues, too. But nowhere near as badly as the new games."
JRPG,3cs5l2,bubblegummonkey1,2,Sat Jul 11 18:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't mean to make it sound like the older FFs did not use tropes or made perfectly developed characters, but just on average they were a lot more relatable and made you think more. Here's hoping!"
JRPG,3cs5l2,HappierShibe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"They gained a lot of love back with Basch, Balthier and Fran. Then threw it away with Snow and Hope. I actually liked Vanille and Fang, their relationship was fantastic. Outside of those two, the rest of the cast of 13 was traaaaaash."
JRPG,3csayq,Khourieat,8,Fri Jul 10 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"The Last Remnant. I think I'm 20-30 hours in?  This game is shit, and I enjoyed Dirge of Cerberus.  All the mechanics are buried and hidden. Nothing is ever explained, ever. I don't need my hand held (Ni No Kuni does a lot of hand holding), but to me the point of an RPG is that the mechanics are transparent, and you can see how it all fits together. This game does the opposite and obfuscates as much of it as possible.  I've lost track of the number of times I've wanted to use an ability, specially heals or debuffs, and NOT have them be available, because the ENTIRE game is run off of the RNG. You have no clue when you or the enemies will take their turns, what set of actions will be available to you, or how the enemy will act. Positioning is also nearly impossible to manage.  I've had battles draw out to 15-20 turns before I wipe, only to restart and end the fight in the 1st turn. The over-reliance on the RNG to me is a mark of a bad game. It removes skill and replaces it with luck. Hell, sometimes you give them commands and they decide to do something else, instead.  You can't equip your team mates for reasons, and they keep asking for stuff but won't take it for you, again, for reasons. Sometimes they ask to fight, and I don't even know what that means. Nothing seems to happen when I go outside, though.  You set up your units into formations, and you unlock a bunch of these, as well as ""upgrades"" for them, but again, it's not explained. I currently have 2 groups using the same formation, but one is using the base v1, and the other is using v2, and I have no idea why. They have the same number of people in the same positions, but somehow one is different from the other.  The game has a digging mechanic that is just awful.  There are no levels, but your characters DO level up. My protagonist is doing 10-20k damage per hit, but I have party members that do 400 damage, and I have no idea why. Like, guy 2 is clearly behind, but I have no idea by how much.  90% of the game is sidequests. If you just do the plot, it seems like you miss out on everything. That's fine, but really you have no indication of this until you stumble into it yourself. With Square games, I expected it to be the other way around, but of the 5 or 6 towns I've explored so far, most of them were optional and missable.  All that said, I keep wanting to learn more about the protagonist and his family. The rest of the cast so far have been really boring, but whatever, I'm finished worse games before.  Plus, I have a hard time quitting games :("

JRPG,3csayq,RevRay,3,Tue Jul 14 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"Two Final Fantasy games for me right now which is totally unusual. I restarted FFIX because I was never able to finish it when it was first due to disc problems and a friend losing the last disc. Made it to the fourth disc both times. Giving it another go right now, still on the first disc. Getting annoyed by the Hot and Cold Chocobo side mission so I might go for a less than optimal run and see how fast I can get through the game. Haven't decided yet.  I'm also playing Lightning Returns because my wife let me move the PS3 into the room with the 60+ inch TV lol. I really enjoyed XIII and XIII-2 and I'm finally picking LR back up. I played for a few hours a few months ago, and I'm in the second day in Luxemburg or whatever the town is called and I'm kinda lost. Having problems getting good ratings in combat just because I'm totally out of sync with everything I learned in the first go around. I think after I finish the current quest I'm on I need to spend some time traveling to the other cities and picking up a larger variance of spells and garbs. What I'm using right now seems to me to be a little weak and I could use some of the status attacks. Went into the Warrens the other day when I was playing and each time I fought those robots the fight took probably four minutes until I got the hang of perfect guarding their attacks and staggering them.  9 is alot easier for me to pick up and play so I think I'm going to try and zerg my way through LR primarily so I can finish the series and not have to relearn the combat and dress system every time I come back to it."

I'm on 2-3 right now and I am not looking forward to Elincia's Gambit. >_<  I also restarted Legend of Dragoon in the hopes that I can finally finish it this time. I got almost to the end last time I played, but then I took a long break and forgot how to do all the additions. It's going well so far. I just started disc 2."

JRPG,3csayq,Huberis187,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"I actually really like a lot of the music in Legend of Dragoon. I also like how in some areas the music is quieter but you hear lots of nature/ambient sounds. You're definitely right about the dialogue. It's so stiff and unnatural sounding. I'm guessing most of that came from the localization, though.  I'm playing on vita as well (the clicky buttons make the additions so satisfying!). I've also been using a guide to find all the stardust because I hate back tracking.  What part of the game are you at?"
JRPG,3csayq,SailsofKharon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"im still really early, Bale i think.  I specifically enjoy the menu music and when they shout out their additions during battle.  but yes the dialogue is very rough.  with in 2 or 3 dialogue boxes it seemed like they were best friends with Lavitz.  they keep trying to make it seem like Shana is independent but it's backfiring and making her sound like a child talking to their parents."
JRPG,3csayq,Huberis187,2,Mon Jul 13 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, the addition shoutouts are awesome! Gust of wind dance! Volcano! I like shouting along with them, so I'm glad my BF just finds it amusing rather than crazy lol.  I think going through what they went through at Helena would be bonding but it's not expressed very well in the script.  And you're right about Shana. It's possible that she was originally written as trying to be independant but not actually able to be yet. Unfortunately the script doesn't get that across very well, if that's the case.  My guess is that the translation team just directly translated, but because Japanese is so formal (compared to English) and doesn't really have pronouns it wound up sounding super unnatural."
JRPG,3csayq,SailsofKharon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"you're right, breaking out of prison would be a bonding experience.  it was just funny how it happened; Lavitz has a soliloquy, decides to join dart, but doesn't ask him about it at all; BFFs off to save a princess!  i agree about the translation point as well.  its easy to see where they are going with most of the dialogue but a native english speaker wouldn't express them selves that way.  i often find myself ad-libbing dialogue in jrpgs when thing just don't quite fit.  something as simple as adding a comma in the right place can completely change the tone or perspective of the sentence.  also shouting additions FTW!"

The job system is great and so much fun. The level of detail given to each characters design for each different job is very nice.

The dungeons got pretty repetitive, and really, I started dreading them. Also, while the combat with the normal enemies was fun, very fast and sharp, the boss fights tended to drag on. By the end, it was a measure of how much I could spam mediaharan.  Also, I was really burned out when the game pulled out another 9 floor dungeon at the true end!  I started Persona 3 as well.

Really enjoyed the story, the graphics are quite old school but don't in my opinion detract from the game.  The end boss battle was a little ridiculous (oh wait, he's not dead yet!  Nope, still not dead!)  but I really like the option you can set to let the difficulty of a fight decrease slightly every time you wipe.  Even on casual you have to think tactically in the battles based on the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, there's no one-size-fits-all strategy.  I felt I only had to spend a little bit of time grinding compared to some other games.  All in all, can't wait for the sequel(s) to make their appearance in English."

It probably has been about 3 years since i last played through the game, and I had the itch to fire it up again.  After spending so much time raving about the game, this time my wife wants to see the game in action.  So far she is really enjoying it.  She is not much of a gamer, so she is content to sit on the couch and watch me go through the game.  The game is just as fun as it always is.  I've played this game so many times that I'm able to get the jury to reach a 'not guilty' verdict for Chrono without having to look anything up.  It confused my wife during the early parts of the game, and she would ask me questions such as: ""Why aren't you taking that bag near the guy asking for his lunch?  It might have treasure in it!"".  The only downside to the game?  I haven't had any time lately to play it!  Too many other obligations in the last week have prevented me from playing."

JRPG,3csayq,Ambience7817,2,Fri Jul 10 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"I just finished Xenoblade on N3DS about a week ago. Boy that game was good. It is considered by many to be the best Console JRPG of the last generation (Wii/PS3/360). I had a lot of discussions with friends and internet people as to where to play the game, Emulated Wii for amazing looks (my PC is a beast) or N3DS for portability. What it came down to was I loved FFX on vita (it was my first play through of it), and I assumed I would love the portability as much as i did FFX. I did. It was amazing to have the Monado's power in my pocket.   For those that don't know, Xenoblade is an open world type game that ran on magic to work on a portable. It has one of the coolest origin stories for a world that i can recall. [This isn't spoilers because it is literally the opening scene] 2 titans of monstrous size fought, the Bionis and the Mechonis, one full of life and the other a machine. the Bionis is where most of the game happens, and it has all the environments of the game on it, a snowy valley, a marsh, a grassy plain, all that stuff on this creature. its really cool.   The party was really fun to use as well. All of them were unique and fun to use, so I wasn't just using the main character the whole time. The combat was single player MMO type, you have 8 abilities to use and position yourself for max damage and a special ability for each member. It was really fun to play.   Since this is a JRPG, you know the music is important. good thing Yoko Shimomura did a lot of the music. Here are my favorites (I urge you to avoid the comments for these as they may have spoilers for the game:   Unique Monster Battle Theme. This is the defining track of the game really. Think of it as Boss music. Kicking electric guitars and a backing Orchestra makes this theme easily my favorite. My Favorite Area Theme. This is the theme that plays in the first area that really sets the scale for how big this game is. It uses vertical height a lot, so your always climbing to get on top of things and trying not to fall down.  Main Theme. Such a great theme, its really Violin Heavy. It really sets the mood for the game.   I out about 80 hours into it, and I could have easily did more. Also, Be aware that there is no post game content. beating the final boss triggers the end game and you can do NG+ with your current gear and levels but no free roam.   To help people out on what version to get, If you have plenty of time at home to sit and play a game, then get it on Wii. But if you move around a lot and want the game whenever you want, get the N3DS version. If you want a comparison video of the 2, Here is one that goes through the opening of the game through the tutorial, don't worry, this isn't spoilers, just the Literal first 15 minutes of the game."

She is credited on 8 of the tracks (of 91), with the majority of the tracks being credited to Manami Kiyota or ACE+ (ACE being the artists CHICO and Tomori Kudo, + being their collaborator for this particular project Kenji Hiramatsu).  Don't get me wrong, I love Shimomura, but if asked who was responsible for the Xenoblade OST being so awesome, I'd point straight at ACE+.  They're not only credited with the first two tracks you linked, but also the final boss theme and the absolutely fantastic pre-boss theme (which is my favorite in the game)!"

I started a playthrough on the Wii twice, but couldn't really get into it for whatever reason. Now I'm about 45 hours into the 3DS version, and it's so good. I think one of the bigger reasons I'm liking playing this game on the 3DS now is that I've been preferring handhelds because of the sleep function - I love being able to start off right where I left off when I open the 3DS.    The gameplay has been great. The visuals, which many have said to be inferior on the 3DS, look great to me. The story has been really enjoyable, too - it's been a good blend of lighthearted and serious, and I like that death in the story actually feels like a horrible thing, much like it would be in reality.  I've also been enjoying the whole ""time"" aspect of the game, fast travel, quest and skill systems, save anywhere, and when you die in-game there isn't a penalty.    Definitely one of the top games I've played lately for me - it's been hitting on all my marks."
JRPG,3csayq,lionheart059,2,Sun Jul 12 06:31:20 2015 UTC,"I've been bouncing between a few games, myself..  Dragon Quest on Android.  I had some credit for the Google Play store, so I snagged this and DQII.  I have both for NES, and used to have the GBC combo cart of them (but lost it in my youth).  Since I don't want to drag out the NES to play the cartridges, this was a pretty good alternative.  I'm about a third of the way through the first one, just playing in my downtime at work, and the nostalgia is strong.  I've hardly ever played II, despite owning it, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it builds on the story.  Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment was bought on a whim because it was on sale last weekend on the PSN.  Or was it two weeks ago?  Regardless.  I bought 4 games from that flash sale, and this is the one I've actually been playing most (the others being Monster Monpiece, Fate/EXTRA PSP, and Genesis Collection PSP).  It's fun, but I also knew nothing about the storyline, so I had to start watching the anime as I was playing.  The mechanics have taken some getting used to, but all in all really quite decent.  And another trip through Spira in Final Fantasy X since I got the HD Remix for PS Vita (and PS3, but the 3 isn't hooked up so eh).  I'm about... halfway?  I'd guess.  The rest of my gaming time has been spent between Final Fantasy Record Keeper, Assassin's Creed: Unity, Destiny, and a few others when the mood strikes me."

JRPG,3csayq,elpistolero27,2,Mon Jul 13 15:25:38 2015 UTC,Chrono Trigger on PS1. First time playing this game I'm about 18 or 19 hours in and close to the end I'm currently on my way to reviving Crono. I can see why people consider this one of the best jrpg (or games in general) ever love the characters story and especially the music.  Only downside is a technical one and that is the load times are really bad. A good six seconds to start a battle or go into the menu.
JRPG,3csayq,Everok,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:04:01 2015 UTC,Those load times are a ps1 version problem sadly. The SNES and DS versions are quick.
JRPG,3csayq,elpistolero27,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I know that now unfortunately I don't own either system. Do you know if the ports of FF onto PS1 have the same problem?

The only thing I don't like is how slow the battles are and that I can't turn up the text speed. I'm playing with a Fighter, Black Belt, White Mage, and Black Mage, which I think might be the same party I chose the first time. I kind of wish I'd gone for a Red Mage instead of Black."

This game is really weird, and I'm surprised I never got around to playing anything from this series until now. I like it so far. Oh, and the encounter rate is so bullshit, especially at the beginning when you don't have enough HP (and PP to heal) to handle it, but I guess that's how these games were."

When you look passed the terrible voice acting and subpar HD upgrade what you have is one of the most fun FF I've played in a while. The combat system is fantastic and rewards thoughtful timing of attacks, and the wealth of playable characters adds a lot of depth. I'm about 12 hours in, level 24 and Rem is my main. I still don't understand the story, but can't wait til 2nd play through to understand more.  Bravely Default: had this sitting in my 3DS for a while. Was one of the reasons why I actually got a 3DS XL! I'm about 10 hours in, grinding a bit to get some subclasses. Man, is the writing in this game solid. Love the cadence and the almost Shakespearean quality to it. Battle system is a lot of fun, art style is wonderful, and music is top notch. Surprisingly love Maribel and Edea a lot. Really great game.  Rocket League: it's cars and jet packs and soccer.. I don't need much of anything else."

I beat SMT 4 a couple of weeks ago, and got a bit tired of the Devil Survivor games, so I thought I'd try another game in the series.   It's good so far, entertaining and the atmosphere is dark. I am not liking the fusion mechanics in this game, and the fact that the MC can't use magic (I might be wrong), but other than that I am liking this game that I thought I'd hate.  I also tried playing Persona 4 since it's the most popular game in the series, but I didn't like it. I can't stand the school setting and having to do school stuff and build social links. Persona Q on the other hand seems to be more focused on the dungeon exploring aspect of the game more than the social crap pf the other Persona games, so I might get into that."
JRPG,3csayq,videogameboss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"some guns in strange journey can shoot elemental spells. if you like strange journey's gameplay you will probably like persona q's gameplay, but you might not fully appreciate the story if you haven't played 3 and 4."
JRPG,3csayq,themadridi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:37:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I haven't unlocked any of the guns yet.  Another reason I think I'd like Persona Q is that I really enjoyed Etrian Mystery Dungeon, another game that is a crossover with the Etrian Series.

JRPG,3csayq,OregonOtter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:31:04 2015 UTC,I've really been into jrpgs in my spare time lately. Here is what I'm trying to tackle at the moment:  Suikoden - I watched an LP of Suikoden II and wanted to give the series a try for myself. Everything in this series is so fluid from the battle system to the graphics. The sprite detail is incredible and colorful. I'm still in the beginning but already in love.  FFXI - One of the few FFs I've never completed and after replaying 7 and 8 over the years 9 is like a breath of fresh air. It's really just a pleasant experience that really gives you a sense of adventure. I like all of the characters so far! It does feel as if the experience per enemy is a little slow in the start of the game so it's making leveling a little bit more of a pain than it needs to be but otherwise its been awesome.
JRPG,3csayq,lionheart059,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:08 2015 UTC,Guessing you mean X or XII... Since XI is an MMO.  Though I suppose you can like all the characters in an MMO...

Terribly sluggish combat, an infuriating Overheat system, weird looking characters, bad voice acting, a by the numbers same old same old story and a turtle slow ""run"" speed to top it all off.   Got near the end of Disk 1 when this boss showed up who was the physical embodiment of 'Cheap as Shit' with bullshit totem poles on the field that heal him and just for the fun of it, they come back after you destroy them. I already just about had it with the game but decided to see if I could power though, but that boss was the last straw.   Not at all worth the overpriced amount I paid for it."

That done, I read a theory once that seemed to put it in an interesting (totally tinfoil) perspective for me.   To make it short, the 5 games are all stages of a time loop. If you watch, all of the worlds get increasingly destroyed/end of world-ish as time goes on until you're trapped in the mine in DQ. At the end, you escape to discover the world renewed for you and the people's trapped in the mine to escape to, in order to restart the loop.   I'm not describing it well, but it at least made the story seem less a waste when I read it in the past."

JRPG,3co82z,kimchi314,2,Thu Jul 9 15:27:35 2015 UTC,Good ending or normal ending?  Did you have Ryu solo Barubary? One of my favorite fights in a JRPG right there.  EDIT: Whoops didn't realize it wasn't a textpost.  Soloing Barubary isn't what dictates the ending you get. It appears you got the normal ending. In order to get the good ending you have to go a little easy on a boss you meet a bit earlier in the adventure...  As well as configure a few things in the homebase.
JRPG,3co82z,jef_sf,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:50 2015 UTC,I am curious how Capcom got around Nintendo's anti-religion policy. One of the first lines in the game (I just restarted it) is Praise God.
JRPG,3co82z,gimm3nicotin3,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"The thing that bothered me most about this game was that BoF1 had several different pieces of dungeon music that were all great and this one pretty much just had that one five second loop that played whether you were in a forest, tower, cave, whale, wherever. It got old early on and almost physically painful by the end of the game."
JRPG,3coqis,Tarul,7,Thu Jul 9 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"It's not really you getting older or the series getting worse; it's just that you're getting tired of it. If you had nothing to play but RTSes for the last 5 years, you'd probably get bored of that as an example. And JRPG storytelling tends to always have the same overarching themes, so seeing the same things pop up over and over gets tiresome even if the basis of for some of the themes happen to be good. Eventually you're just like, ""Please just die or slap someone. Do something original. No? Okay, whatever."""
JRPG,3coqis,Jamaz,2,Thu Jul 9 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's definitely true. I guess I really just want the Tales combat and skits shoved into another story-telling mechanism. I'm starting to get tired of the ""young kid has to save the world through per-chance events that cause him to get involved with a global conflict,"" but I really do enjoy the gameplay. The gameplay has made quite a few strides since the Symphonia days; I just wish that the stories would do the same."
JRPG,3coqis,Jamaz,3,Thu Jul 9 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"That's like every video game for me nowadays (I'm an old fogey at 30). I've seen it all, so I only play games that are fun versus hoping to find something that piques my literary interests - only books and cinema can really hit that spot now. And luckily, the Tales Series does focus on being fun if you aren't tired of the arena action battle setup yet. You gotta learn to let go of the expectation that ""a series will grow up with you"" though. I've found this belief to be resoundingly false throughout my gaming career."
JRPG,3coqis,jamvng,3,Thu Jul 9 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I just hit 20, but I played a lot of video games in middle through high school. A lot of JRPGs don't have as much appeal to me storywise because they're either super cliched and/or weirdly pseudo-philosophical (as in, they try to present moral dilemmas, and then end up discrediting the villain's viewpoint by making the villain almost comically extreme).  That said, I still think a bunch of video games have great stories that rival cinema. ""The Last of Us,"" ""Witcher 3"" (based on a book, I know), and JRPGs like ""Child of Light"" (it does the fairy tale idea well, though I don't really consider the setting/atmosphere to be typical JRPG) and ""The World Ends with You"" I find entertaining."
JRPG,3coqis,jamvng,3,Thu Jul 9 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think there have been a decent amount of Western titles that have broken ground in terms of story telling and world building. As you mentioned, Witcher 3 is a great recent example of achievement in that regards.   Japanese games, and JRPGs, haven't had many breakthrough games that have innovated much in contrast."
JRPG,3coqis,jamvng,2,Thu Jul 9 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way - the Bioshock series, Transistor/Bastion is presentation, the list goes on.  I still enjoy JRPGs because they're personal. They feel more like I am involved with their struggles, instead of sympathizing with Booker/Geralt/etc. But I've found, that, if I want a good story or something new/innovative, I need to look at WRPGs (which I don't mind, but still...) Though I've heard good things in this thread about Nier..."
JRPG,3coqis,11ThatOneGuy11,2,Fri Jul 10 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"I felt like Geralt and Ciri's story (w/ Yen and Triss) was quite personal. But I think I know what you mean. The character interactions in good JRPGs are just unique and have their own special japanese chemistry. A lot of the times it's super cheesy but when done well I find myself smiling all the time. Think FFVI-IX. Most recently for me I've been playing Tales of Hearts R, the story is meh but loving the characters still. And the signature Tales skits are always funny.  However, Japanese games do easily fall into the same cliches and tropes,so I can easily see people get tired of them"
JRPG,3coqis,jamvng,2,Fri Jul 10 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yen vs Triss was the first romance where I actually couldn't pick one. I literally had to decide via coin-toss.  WRPGs are more realistic, and I think they're usually better done generally. JRPG romances are tropey and heavily romanticized, but if it's decently done, it's like junk food :P"
JRPG,3coqis,jamvng,2,Fri Jul 10 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"I was set on Triss (only just started reading the Witcher books), but the Last Wish mission made it hard to turn down Yen.... Such a well done mission (one of many in the game).

I haven't played a JRPG in awhile though and am fairly new to the Tales games so I'm still looking forward to Zestirea."
JRPG,3coqis,3nigmax,3,Thu Jul 9 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"This series has always had a heavy focus on battle system/gameplay. In the early years, only one team was responsible for the series. The so called ""Team Destiny"" made almost all 2D Tales of games. And the two best until this day in the series (Destiny Remake and Rebirth). Tales of Symphonia was made by a different team, that now is know as ""Team Symphonia"", and they have a much greater focus on the story/world-building department, and they are way better then ""Team Destiny"" in this regard. But when it comes to battle system, they are miles behind ""Team Destiny"".  To make things clear... Team Destiny: Destiny, Phantasia PSX, Eternia, Destiny 2, Rebirth, Destiny Remake, Hearts, Graces and Zestiria.  Team Symphonia: Symphonia, Abyss, Vesperia and Berseria?  The Xillia games was made by a mixed team, as far as i know."
JRPG,3coqis,3nigmax,2,Thu Jul 9 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"Actually.... http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Symphonia http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Destiny  The ""Team"" terminology happened after the creation of Namco Tales Studio. Hearts was made by both team. Graces was made by Team Destiny with input from Team Symphonia regarding 3D stuffs. Xillia was the last project for both team and not long after its release the whole Namco Tales Studio thing was dissolved and merged with the parent company so there's no longer distinction between each team after that."
JRPG,3coqis,3nigmax,3,Fri Jul 10 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that Xillia 2 was rather lazy, but if you look at a lot of other ""Act 2"" JRPGs like Devil Summoner 2 or Final Fantasy X-2, you can see that it's a rather common occurrence.   But if it isn't broken, don't fix it. Tales games are obviously big in Japan, and I imagine it would be very hard to do anything different."
JRPG,3coqis,3nigmax,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I'm starting to feel the CoD syndrome from the Tales series. Same game with a slightly different story and more polished combat system than its predecessor.  Honestly, I'd probably be okay if they kept everything the same and just updated their engines; make the facial expressions and animations more life-like. A lot of the time, the characters look like dolls that do an exaggerated motion when its their turn to interact with the party outside of combat."
JRPG,3coqis,Sekacnap,3,Thu Jul 9 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of fun with the original Xillia, so I only partially see where you're coming from. Zestiria does shake things up quite a bit, so maybe that will help bring you back in.  If the Tales series were to make changes, I would like to see more focus on improving the story and the art. The animation often lacks weight of motion - try comparing how intense the Artes look in the anime opening to in game. Although the character design and environment design are often pretty good, the 3D modeling / shading isn't as impressive as other anime inspired games like the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series. I think there's a lot of room for improvement in these areas that would make the game feel more engaging and way less stale. And the story, well, you all already know how it is. Xillia did some things thematically that were pretty good, but I don't think anyone would deny that they have room to continue to improve in that regard."
JRPG,3coqis,Rascyc,3,Thu Jul 9 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yup! Those were the exact changes I had in mind. I enjoy the combat, and I enjoy the skits A LOT. No game offers a similar experience (in terms of skits and combat), so it sometimes frustrates me that I can't find any alternatives with a stronger/more interesting story and better characters motions that make the characters feel more alive and less like rag dolls.  Also, just a side-note: I have absolutely no problem with cliches, as cliches inherently have to be used to make a good story. It's just that when the story is entirely made up of cliches, then I have a problem. I'm probably going to check out Zestiria though, especially if the PC port ends up being solid (I'm a little wary about the game's performance on the PS3)."

JRPG,3coqis,bureburebure,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"Star Ocean as a whole is very similar to Tales and features many of the same mechanics while giving them more importance. Rather than Skits, you have Personal Actions where you have various interactions with your party available to you based on your relationship with them. The battle system is similar, though it has more twitch-based elements and gives rewards that carry between battles if you consistently do well.  Being that they are very similar series, they also have the same kind of progression with regards to graphics, story telling, etc. A lot of people think either the original or Second Story (the second game) are the best entries. Depending on your tolerance for the limitations of older games, you may or may not enjoy these. They did get PSP ports that were very good and helped do away with the problems with the originals, but you may or may not be open to trying to track down a PSP and the games.   The third one, Till the End of Time, is kind of the middling entry. It is a very good game and brought the series into 3D, while still retaining a lot of the charm of the original games. This seems to be the one everyone enjoys, but not many call it the best.  The 4th one, The Last Hope, seems to be a pretty polarizing entry. It definitely looks fantastic and plays wonderfully in my personal opinion. However, many were not a fan of the story and it's pacing. Many of the characters come across flat and poorly voiced, though some are very well done. There is also one particular character that is just generally a terror in the voice acting department and ruined the game for a lot of people. I personally loved the game, but it definitely seems to be the FFXIII of the series, if that comparison helps you at all.  Depending on your tolerance for older games that don't already have nostalgia, you may or may not enjoy the original games. If you prefer a more modern entry, SO3 seems to be the popular choice, and many use it as a jumping on point to help bridge the gap. Similar to how Symphonia or FFX allow people to jump on and appreciate the basic structure and themes of the series so that they can enjoy both past and future entries. All that said, the stories ARE related, though there is usually a significant amount of in game time between the entries. They are the same universe and loosely share an overarching plot. So if chronology or experience a story in the intended order is important to you, that's something to consider.  Hope all this has helped. I kinda started rambling lol."
JRPG,3coqis,bureburebure,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm sounds interesting! I have to admit, I'm not a fan of playing older games (as a spoiled modern person, it's hard for me to go backwards technologically), but SO3 sounds interesting. I'll check it out! Bad voice acting kind of hurts me, unless it's comically bad, in which case I find it hilarious (Tales of Xillia 2 in some cases). How bad is SO4's VA?"
JRPG,3coqis,jamvng,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:27:56 2015 UTC,"It pretty much runs the gamut from just plain bad, comically bad, acceptable, good, and great. Most of the cast falls under acceptable and good in my opinion. Most of the problem is sometimes they are just a little flat. There are 2 characters in particular that tend to ruin the experience for people and it's hard to say whether you would consider them just plan bad or comically bad. Here is a video of an argument those 2 characters have with each other that's spoiler free other than revealing that those 2 characters exist."

JRPG,3coqis,Sychotics,3,Sat Jul 11 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"I can't say I agree, storywise. I think the stories have always been kinda meh but greatly entertaining regardless. Other than their respective twists, even Symphonia/Abyss/Vesperia weren't anything special plot wise. As for the newer stuff I didn't care for Xillia's plot too much but I do have to say that Graces F had one of my favorites by far. They took the plot in a few bold directions that I thought were really satisfying, in particular how everything wasn't magically alright between everyone after the prologue and the ""F"" arc's focus on Sophie's ""problem"" (the characters weren't as good though imo).  Where the magic truly lies is with the characters, and on that account I do agree with you, they're running out of tropes and it's starting to show. That doesn't mean I don't love the characters but there's always going to be the same types, the super strong loli, the dashing playboy, the genius, etc. and that kinda gets a little tiring. However, that's just something I've accepted as part of the series, ultimately it's my love of those tropes that keeps me coming back for more. It's always familiar, yet they flavor things differently each time to keep it somewhat fresh.  All in all, I don't think the games are getting worse at all. I think they just haven't changed enough and since we've played so many we're noticing the trends. They're very safe games, you know exactly what you're getting when you buy a Tales game and that's simultaneously part of the charm and part of the problem."

Very elegantly put. Couldn't have phrased it better, myself :)   However, that's just something I've accepted as part of the series, ultimately it's my love of those tropes that keeps me coming back for more.   This is I have to disagree with slightly. Yes, tropes are great - we like polarized or dramatized characters; see: most literature everywhere. However, Tales games try to substitute personality with tropes. You can have a character belong to a certain trope, but if their personality is so one-note that they can almost entirely be defined by a trope, then I have a slight problem. I enjoy the series, but I would greatly appreciate it if it tried to evolve to be a little more risky and ambitious. I'm not saying go full morally-gray or anything, but have more fleshed out characters (think Legend of Korra, if you've seen it, for example. The characters there belong to tropes, but it's hard to easily describe them as just a trope)."

The gameplay is fun enough, and even if you don't care for some of the more recent entries the Tales series has never stuck to a single system for too long. I am disappointed to see things like costumes left out as DLC at exorbitant prices."
JRPG,3coqis,renatomunhozz,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"I thought that the Xillia games were pretty good in terms of story. Xillia 2 also did some new things, and I really appreciated that even if the execution was a bit lacking at times. I do agree that the series is often too complacent, using the same plot structures and elements, even more so than the average JRPG. It's not even a twist anymore that there is another world in many of these games. Games like Graces and Hearts are especially bad in this respect even though I thought Hearts R executed its cliches well.   As for whether the Tales games will improve, it's hard to say for sure. Berseria seems to at least have a different kind of protagonist with its female pirate captain, but I guess we'll have to wait and see whether that's the only thing it's innovating in.   In the meantime, I suggest you play less typical JRPGs like the original version of Soul Sacrifice, the Nier/Drakengard series, Devil Survivor, etc. That way you don't get too tired of seeing the same tropes over and over again. Personally I think it's a bad idea to play two Tales games back to back. I usually only play one Tales game per year at most, and I think that helps me enjoy them more."
JRPG,3coqis,renatomunhozz,0,Thu Jul 9 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of problems with Xillia 2. Ironically, I also played Xillia 2 the most out of any Tales game (70 hours first playthrough to beat the entire postgame lol), which is probably why I feel so strongly about it. The entire game is about  I really enjoyed the Persona series, The World Ends with You, Child of Light, and bits of Ni No Kuni. I'm looking into Nier, it seems interesting! I haven't heard great things about Drakengard's gameplay, though, which deters me from playing it...  Edit: I suck at making spoilers. How do I make the black stuff? I can't figure it out :\"
JRPG,3coqis,DecemberFlame,2,Thu Jul 9 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into Nier, it seems interesting   given your other comments in this thread it just makes me think that you need to play it even more.  NieR is about the closest thing to a storytelling breakthrough JRPG's have had in the last few years, as far as I'm concerned. It has a very different tone and presentation from just about anything else in the genre and it has some of the most powerful examples of games as a storytelling medium i've ever seen (by having narrative elements that would only be possible in a game).  as for the drakengard series (of which nier is a part)...well, i haven't played drakengard 1 myself but consensus is that yes it's not a very good game all-around. i'd go so far as to say it doesn't have a very good narrative in the technical sense either, it's more like a car crash or some other horrible thing that you can't look away from. haven't played drakengard 2 either but it's usually considered the weakest game in the series by fans who enjoy the things specific to drakengard, mostly because the director and main writer of the first game wasn't involved so it wasn't nearly as subversive or interesting.  i've played drakengard 3 however. it's not nearly as strong or memorable an experience as nier imo, but it IS kinda interesting and worth a look provided you keep your expectations in check. the characters aren't the deepest but they are pretty entertaining and subvert a number of JRPG conventions."
JRPG,3cnkb0,Headobanger,8,Thu Jul 9 08:03:51 2015 UTC,"Dandy Richmond.  For various reasons, starting with; he's completely out of place as far as Suikoden II goes.  The game is magic fantasy themed, and out of nowhere we see this guy who seems to be channeling Dick Gumshoe while this, I dunno, 30's, 40's music plays on the background (I was never good at placing music years... point is; his theme sounds as anachronical as his appearance)  I also really like the way he manipulates the situation in his brief story-focused parts. He plays everyone, including Shu the master strategist, like a fiddle.  And that wasn't even something he had to do; he was hired to find information on Shu, not to trick Shu into a corner. He just wanted to help the war in his own way.  Also he has a cute little puppy stuffed inside of shirt with his cute little head out and the game never bothers to focus on that.  Now, if I have to pick a playable character... I like Zamza. He's one of the earliest non-essential characters who has a well-defined personality, so I always enjoyed recruiting him as soon as possible. Even so, he is fairly weak. I also always liked both Wakaba and Viki.  If I had to pick my least favorite character, though, it'd be Sheena, hands down."
JRPG,3cnkb0,Grandy12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:00:24 2015 UTC,"Suikoden's got quite a few characters that appear to be ""out of time"" in a way. Clive, with his guns, doesn't quite fit.

To me, the characters like Clive and Elsa and Adlai who are oddities in the Suikoden world fit in very well despite that. And they help make the cast be even more unique.  And his theme is quite nice, too."
JRPG,3cnkb0,ObsidianTK,7,Thu Jul 9 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's cliche to name a main character, but I think it's gotta be Chris from S3. I feel like not a lot of video game main characters are really forced to confront their background and belief systems the way Chris has to when she really gets to know the Grasslands cultures, and she really grows as a character a lot because of that. I think that arc really plays out well if you go against canon and give her the True Fire Rune, which causes the most of the Grasslands tribes to fuck right off, and she has to convince them that she really has changed from her Zexen roots before they'll fight for her."

The obvious ones are Viktor, Flik, Cleo, Pahn etc...   But some somewhat more outside characters I love are.  S1 - Tai Ho and Yam Koo, pretty cool characters and with Turtle Runes completely and utterly OP. My one knock on S2 was the Yam Koo didn't fight.  S2 - Mukumuku @ co, i always love the ridiculousness of beating the game with a team of flying squirrels.  s3 - Sgt. Joe - The fact that they decided to go with a anthropomorphic duck as a major character in s3 was a bold move, to say the least, but it worked."

I don't see my friend anymore but I miss playing and talking to someone about it -- doing Let's Plays fills that void.  I try to be not too over the top in my commentary. I'm still new so I feel I have a lot of growing to do but I'm getting a lot more comfortable behind the mic.  I haven't started a new series since the last thread but my channel focuses on jRPGs (as I'm sure many channels do).

In a way, it helps keep the games challenging (starting a character on a new job with no skills learned), which I enjoy.  I like how once you master a class, your base class gets more powerful, but it's optional if you choose to use the base class or not.  I wish more games did a job system-like thing."

Just want more interesting mechanics in general.  If you haven't played Breath of Death VII or Cthulu Saves the World, they are shining examples of difficulty in JRPGs done right, and I'm super excited for their next game."

JRPG,3ckb3l,jojotdfb,2,Wed Jul 8 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"DQIX's biggest flaw was that it was trying to be a lan based mmo on ds. They didn't focus on the story as much and it suffered. Try out V and VI, they have better stories and good examples of how a job system could work."
JRPG,3ckb3l,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:36 2015 UTC,V isn't the best if you're really into job systems. It's definitely better for a classic JRPG feel like FFIV.

JRPG,3ckb3l,Daverost,13,Wed Jul 8 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""best"" or even necessarily ""good,"" but I always thought Rogue Galaxy's skill system was neat.  http://i.imgur.com/eR7yBJm.jpg  Instead of unlocking skills by grinding levels or points or whatever, you essentially created skills out of items. It was a skill tree that you could tackle various parts of separately, so you could collect for a few different skills at a time.  And since some items were stuck with certain enemies on certain maps, you couldn't grind your way into the most broken skills in the game and cheese bosses. Even if you could work on your level, you had to work with the resources you were given at any particular point and nothing more, so there was always a little challenge enforced on you as a player.  ...I miss that game. I wish it would get an HD re-release. Particularly on Vita."

JRPG,3ckb3l,underpantsviking,18,Thu Jul 9 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, I really like the Materia system from FFVII.  There's a lot of good variety in it and therefore a lot of great ways to customize your team.  It was definitely a lot of fun for me to play around with as I went through the game.  Worst is definitely the License system from FFXII.  It's not a terrible idea in theory, but grinding for LP is unnecessarily tedious and really limits your ability to appreciate the various abilities it has to offer.  Maybe if it was only used for abilities it wouldn't be so bad and didn't also limit the equipment and magic you could use, then I'd like it more, but as it is now, I really wasn't impressed."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Electrium,5,Wed Jul 8 16:23:37 2015 UTC,The fact that FFVII is so god damn easy is what hurts the Materia system the most. The biggest shame about Materia is how much you never have to do with it.
JRPG,3ckb3l,Onuss-Warkem,6,Wed Jul 8 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"It still boggles my mind to this day that there are so many people out there who hated the Materia system. I thought it was such a great system, so much fun."
JRPG,3ckb3l,kimpy7,16,Wed Jul 8 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"My problem with the Materia system was always that your decisions have very little weight, and they don't contribute to the identity of the character. It doesn't really matter who uses which Materia at which point in the game; the progression of the character is completely uncoupled from the progression of Materia.   The job system in Bravely Default, for example, accomplishes the same end as FF7 but does so in a way that gives your characters ""permanently"" defined roles. Your healer character should continue to learn healing abilities, since that's what's most efficient. If that character dies or is removed from your party, the significance is amplified by the fact that no one else can fill their place as effectively. In FF7 - Oh, Aeris died? Oh well, I guess I'll just give her Materia to _____ then. Cloud is suffering from Mako poisoning? Alright Tifa, have fun being OP as hell while he's out.  That's why I don't think it's surprising that people don't look back on it as fondly as other systems."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Xujhan,6,Wed Jul 8 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"But that's the beauty of the materia system, it doesn't limit your character in any way. It's just another piece of equipment, but it's the only piece of equipment that won't eventually become useless and sold for pennies.   Your characters will be defined by the actions and choices each one makes in the story. How you decide to equip your team will determine what your battles will look like, and there's a lot of room for variation, so you can personalize your style."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Antilurker77,5,Wed Jul 8 19:34:13 2015 UTC,That's what I don't like though. It makes every character feel the same combat wise. I enjoy it much more when each character stands out as their own thing.
JRPG,3ckb3l,ishkabibbel2000,4,Wed Jul 8 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"That's not inherently a flaw in the materia system. The characters did have inherent strengths and weaknesses; Tifa had high strength, crazy-strong weapons, and a multi-hit single target limit break, all of which lends her to being a boss-killer. Vincent's limit breaks were great for random battles but poor in bosses, so he has a high magic stat that allows him to act as a mage when his limit break would be a liability.  The potential is all there in the design; the problem was that materia was so powerful that it overrode all the uniqueness in the character design. FFVI has the same problem; even though its characters are all very clearly distinct, eventually you just end up double-casting free Ultimas because nothing else really compares."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Xujhan,11,Wed Jul 8 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"It's very, very easy to completely break the game with it."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Indoorsman,0,Wed Jul 8 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"Let's see...     Phoenix + Final Attack Knight's of the Round + Drain Health (extra style if everyone also has mimic since the drain health is also copied)     Those are the only 2 I can think of from the top of my head, but both of them put the game on easier-than-easy mode."

JRPG,3ckb3l,roastedpot,4,Thu Jul 9 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"Because it takes the uniqueness of your characters down to what their limit breaks are. And it's very easy to break the game with some broken combos. It's cool for its time but I really hope it's improved for the remake. The sphere grid I remember more fondly because while everyone can learn any ability, each character is more suited for learning a certain type of ability and you actually have an influence over how they develop."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Toadinator2000,3,Wed Jul 8 21:01:36 2015 UTC,I accredit a lot of that to the 'FFVII hate circlejerk'
JRPG,3ckb3l,DessertWitch,4,Wed Jul 8 18:48:32 2015 UTC,as opposed to the 'FFVII can do no wrong circlejerk'?  its a game that polarizes it seems. that or the people who live and die by the game put everyone who even critiques the game in the hate circlejerk group.  *i also really hate the idea of 'circlejerks' because a decently large group dislike or like something therefore it has to be unfounded and them just going full on group mentality right?
JRPG,3ckb3l,siirna,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"I worded that poorly.  I don't mean to say that I think FFVII is without fault and I apologize if it came off like I was belittling anyone's opinions of the game, positive or negative."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Vorgier,5,Wed Jul 8 20:02:04 2015 UTC,"Digital Devil Saga's mantra system is kind of cool. You learn each mantra's group of skills when you master that mantra and you can mix and match these skills individually however you'd like to build the characters the way you want. The only thing about the system that I didn't like was the fact that mantras didn't change your appearance, but that was an assumption I made when I started the game at 4 in the morning and I quickly realized that I was dumb for assuming that."

JRPG,3ckb3l,YourShoelaceIsUntied,6,Thu Jul 9 04:23:29 2015 UTC,My favorite is the Sphere Grid from FFX. Nothing else was nearly as exciting. Being able to teach X character skills they originally couldn't use by traversing this grid was awesome. When you finally earn that XP to finally make it across the board to get Haste... It also created the option for really finite min maxing opportunities.
JRPG,3ckb3l,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:59:59 2015 UTC,What did you think of my initial criticism of the flaws with the Sphere Grid from FFX?
JRPG,3ckb3l,Vorgier,3,Wed Jul 8 18:07:40 2015 UTC,Never personally had a huge bulk of points to spend at one time. I didn't mind going into the sphere grid every once in awhile once I had a small bulk of points saved up. It was one of my favorite parts of the game so I was always excited to see what sort of new stuff I could unlock. Also a lot of decision making if you wanted to really maximize a characters strength.  I really wish a new game would copy that system.  FFX was also my first JRPG believe it or not (never had a snes or ps1) so the whole game has a solid spot in my heart. Might be bias because of that but eh.
JRPG,3ckb3l,Aurigarion,4,Wed Jul 8 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"If you're into Diablo style games, Path of Exile copies the sphere grid pretty heavily (and items use a materia-ish system of VII)."

JRPG,3ckb3l,Tarul,3,Wed Jul 8 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can call it an JRPG, andI'm not sure how many other MMOs do this, but FFXIV's spells/abilities are great because you get higher tier spells (Cure, Cure II, Cure III for example) and you never stop using a single one. The higher ones restore more and cost more MP like in other games, but each one has an effect that makes them not useless.   I'm also a huge fan of FFV and Bravely Default's ability system. You level up Jobs separate from your character and those Jobs learn abilities (spells, active skills, passive skills, new commands). You can have a Main job, and equip a set of abilities/commands from a sub-job. You can also add in a few passives from other jobs, and equip yourself with certain items that grant abilities similar to what you'd find on these jobs. Systems like that have a LOT to play around with and there's usually a way to win with any type of party."
JRPG,3ckb3l,aznanimedude,6,Wed Jul 8 18:00:39 2015 UTC,more games need job systems
JRPG,3ckb3l,Toadinator2000,2,Wed Jul 8 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I'm playing through the Dragon Quest series and I didn't start having fun until 3, where there was a Job system. Now I'm on V where there is no job system, and can't wait to get to VI where it will return!"
JRPG,3ckb3l,Soluzar,10,Wed Jul 8 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the Persona system for leveling.  Generalizing:   You level your main character for hp, defence, and basic attacks You level/choose your personas for special skills You gain personality points (intelligence, charm,confidence,etc) from your interactions with the world.   The separation of the systems makes it easy to grind a specific trait if you ever need to, but you will still use all of the system while playing normally. I value ease-of-use and customability when discussing preferred leveling systems."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Mattnificent,4,Wed Jul 8 16:39:55 2015 UTC,"more importantly was that the social link exp system and how they set the story made it so you didn't prioritize one over the other, i.e. just dungeon grind to level your persona because it's infinitely slower and  you don't really gain many levels that way but at the same time, you don't ignore dungeons because otherwise you break the plot and it punishes you for that so it really makes you learn how to budget your time"
JRPG,3ckb3l,Soluzar,3,Wed Jul 8 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm playing Grandia so its in my mind a lot, its systems irritate me.  The levelling ability for skills isn't so bad, since I'll probably be using Fire a lot anyway, so naturally it'll level up and cause me to learn the top level fire magic, thats fine.  Where it all falls flat is mastery, each move has stars, 5 stars and you master it, downside is I'll have to cast level 1 fire 200+ times to reach mastery, even long after I've unlocked level 3 fire magic thats more powerful and hits more enemies.  Whats the benefit of levelling the stars and gaining mastery you ask? Just so that my casting time decreases, which is good, I want that, but its badly done.  Especially given that a battle against an enemy group will often be over before my character who I want to levels turn comes up, so thus she never gets to cast, if I want to stop that happening I tell others to block, and she can caste, gain some % of a star and so on, downside to this is now the enemies can attack and I'm going to have to be injured just because I wanted to progress this spell.  Risk vs reward is fine, but this method of doing it feels super grindy and flawed to me.  My worst system is err, FFX's sphere grid, I think overall the design is nice, but where it falls flat is that I've aquired lets say 200 points to spend on the grid, aaaand now i have to spend 10 minutes just pressing X over and over to progress through the moves, that part isn't fun, its especially not fun if you save a LOT of points and do it, it doesn't feel so bad if you do it one at a time, but then having to constantly open your menu and sphere grid after every battle is just time consuming and annoying.  Outside of that the sphere grid is actually really good, but that manual progression really pulls it down. being able to set a path early on and have it auto progress down your setout path would have been a great way to do it."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Mattnificent,8,Wed Jul 8 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"To me, the Sphere Grid is fine as you go through the main story, but at the endgame, it's not great because you have to grind a lot just to progress a little and it forces you to grind for rare spheres just to continue."
JRPG,3ckb3l,aznanimedude,2,Wed Jul 8 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"The 'level' unlock spheres are annoying yeah, especially the order they go in. You get level 2 in Zanarkand but you get level 3 and 4 about 1/2 way into the game."
JRPG,3ckb3l,Kenpokid4,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"It is annoying during the regular game for me though. I never really know what the path is to any given skill I want, because the grid is too damn sprawling. I almost always (having played the game twice) end up not having the skills I need to deal with a boss efficiently. I guess you could say that's partly my fault though.  The worst thing that game does is let a character level up and then gain nothing. You sometime move a space on the grid, and there just isn't a new node in reach, because some spaces are empty. That's not fun, so much as it is a kick in the teeth.  Bear in mind I don't actually hate the game. I've played through it twice and done a lot of the optional stuff. It isn't a favourite, but I do enjoy it."

While it got really annoying whenever you ran out of a certain type of sphere (damn ability spheres), I thought the fact that you could take one character and put them in another character's leveling path was great! It definitely added replayability to the game, at least to me, since I had fun most recently playing a playthrough where every character went on another character's path. Tidus was the healer, yuna had high hp and attack and used power and magic break.  Plus, I think the system adds a lot to the endgame, as it's very possible to give one character every skill in the game and unlimited strength, even to the point where your black mage can OHKO the last boss in a single overdrive. I can totally understand not liking it, but I wouldn't say it's the worst. Not while the crystarium and it's story-tied level caps exist..."

In FF7/8 you obtain the abilities and give them to whomever. In FF10 it feels kinda cool to have the abilities be developed by the individual character.

I know underlevelled ones get a boost to catch up, but wondering where the cutoff for under/over level is.  This means I can finally stop casting bloody Diggin then (really hate the spell names and abbreviations here) since its moving nowhere and gives me a lot less exp than casting tremor."

You had more freedom (""Sorry Alvin, but you're not getting any smarter today!"") because you could put points into character stats (intelligence, agility, vitality, etc) while being able to plan the skills you want to get in the future. In Xillia 2, I just arbitrarily assigned element points to characters so that each character had the same amount for each stat. Due to it only showing what skills you could get after you obtained x amount of element points, Xillia 2's system didn't encourage as much planning as the former."
JRPG,3ckb3l,3nigmax,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:32:00 2015 UTC,Can you explain why? and how it works?
JRPG,3ckb3l,wtfcblog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"The Allium Orb system is all about assigning points six parameters per each character. Points, called EO, are earned alongside EXP or by inspecting certain spots on the field. An Extractor is used to tell which parameter(s) are going to automatically get assigned EO points and how much. For an example, if an enemy give you 20 EO and you are equipping a level 1 parameter A + level 1 parameter B Extractor, then both A and B get assigned 20 points each. If it's a level 3 parameter C Extractor, then C get assigned 60 points instead. When the point in each parameter (or a combination of two) reaches a certain number, you get an arte (a move or a magic) or skill. You get Extractors from story progression, completing side quests or buying/forging them from shops. Only one of them can be equipped at a time per character.  The whole progression happens automatically and you only have to manually select which Extractors you want and when to switch them around based on a glimpse at only a few artes or skills you'd be getting next. This means that you can barely plan without a guide. And the system's tedious because you have to monitor six parameters for nine playable characters, so 54 parameters in total. I'd also love to hear why 7mad prefer this over the one used in Xillia 1. (Which is similar to either sphere grid or crystarium. Describing it would make this comment even longer so I'll stop at this.)"

Going into that game the first time was a little confusing, but as you got used to it learning a new technique was always fun. Finding the secret power techniques was awesome.  I enjoyed that you had to use a weapon type to learn something and it was presented as an idea that suddenly pops into your head after using it enough. Sure it was a little annoying when you wanted to do something and you end up learning something and using it to less effect. That was just the regular humans.

JRPG,3ckb3l,CalmBalm,3,Fri Jul 10 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"Dragon Quest 8 has a really shitty system. Basically each character has 5 skill trees you can put points in, some are unique to the character and some are shared. Doesn't sound too bad but the way they handled it sucks.  You get almost no info on what each skill tree unlocks. The most information you get is a little blurb on the level up screen like ""Whips can hit a group of enemies"". It's not a linear ""put points in swords to make sword attacks stronger"" system. Instead there are arbitrary breakpoints that award situational skills. The breakpoints are really unbalanced. For example, the strongest whip attack is at 23 points while the strongest axe attack requires 100 points. There are very clearly superior and inferior trees, that you wouldn't know about without outside knowledge. It's not that bad because its the kind of game where you can grind your way past anything regardless of your build, but it makes any semblance of conscious character planning impossible without looking up a faq on when skills unlock.  edit: My overall least favorite system is the kind where you're supposed to micromanage level up bonuses, usually through items equipped at the time of the level up. Final Fantasy 6, Valkyrie Profile, and Tales of the Abyss all have this, even though I love them otherwise. It's annoying to keep checking everyones xp to level, switching them out of the party or killing them to avoid them leveling up at the same time as someone you want the same bonus on, and eventually forgetting to switch someone resulting in them leveling up without any bonuses at all."

JRPG,3ckb3l,Kenpokid4,3,Fri Jul 10 18:54:20 2015 UTC,"Tales of Graces ƒ's title system.  Characters learn skills (largely passives), artes (moves or spells), and get stat boosts from equipped titles (one at a time per character). The titles themselves can be obtained through various means such as using an arte a set number of times to unlock a title that gets you upgrades for that arte, getting hit with an ailment a few times to get a title with skills tailored to handling that ailment, completing character sidequests to grant them new titles or even from just progressing through the story. Most titles (and therefore artes) are unique to characters but, titles like the ailment preventives are not. Each title comes with an effect you only get from it while it's equipped adding another layer to customization with effects like critical rate up vs a certain kind of enemy or adding a certain attribute to your attacks. Aside from their personal effects, titles also come with 5 of a mix of the aforementioned stat boosts, skills or artes which you learn from them by gaining SP while they're equipped. You must learn these in the order of their appearance and, naturally, the later ones cost more SP than earlier ones. SP is gained from battles or doing fetch quests. One last thing, mastering titles. Titles can be mastered once you've learnt the 5 skills/stats/artes they have to offer. From then on, any SP you gain while the title is equipped goes into mastering the title and not into learning anything new (note that you keep what you've learned from any title, regardless of the equipped title, once it's been learned). The SP cost for mastering titles is fairly large but what mastery does is that it upgrades the effect of the title-exclusive effect associated with that title. This isn't something you're likely to care about during the main game when you'd likely be hopping through titles to get all the stuff you want as opposed to sitting in one title forever to get mastery and then suffer a reduced skill/move-set as a result. SP gained while you've equipped a mastered title is effectively wasted. You can handle title management manually or set it so that the game jumps through titles at particular points for you (at Lv3, at Lv5, at mastery) for each character as you choose. On a personal note, I found it a bit annoying that for artes you weren't given much direction as to what you were getting apart from the name that the arte bears till you actually learned it."

JRPG,3ckb3l,CitrusChrome,4,Thu Jul 9 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"FFXIII feels... dull. Instead of traditional levels and XP points, you earn CP (Crystarium Points) and can use them to either gain stats, HP, or abilities. Here's a picture, it's easier to see. There are no major branches, but occasionally you have to go a few steps out of the way to get a new ability or two. I've been playing it recently, and it bugs me how specialization doesn't really mean much, since usually by the time I get a Crystarium expansion, I've already maxed out skills on most of my main trees. Also the sense of progression and getting stronger is hurt by the fact there's no big indicator of my level. I have no way of gauging how I'm doing compared to where I should be, and the random difficulty spikes don't help.   I've also been binging Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2 (Ironically, not a GBA game.) and I love almost all of the design choices. Levels work pretty much like in Fire Emblem (I'm not sure if it's 100xp/level, but it feels like that most of the time) but skills/abilities come from weapons. Completing quests earns AP (usually 20-50) and help every character (even ones who didn't participate -- though they don't get XP) in earning new skills. So like, I have a sword that will teach me a certain skill after I've earned 200 AP with it equipped -- I can use it as long as I've got the weapon equipped, regardless of whether or not I've mastered it (useful for some of the skills with AP costs of 400-500) and then after I've mastered it, I can use it as long as I have that set of job skills equipped.   Skills are tied to jobs, but each character has access to two sets of job skills (one for the job they're currently using, and one for skills they've mastered as another job), a passive ability, and a reaction ability (think counter, magic shield, etc.) at once. So I had one character, for example, who I taught some thief abilities so she could become a ninja (using ninja and thief abilities), then taught her the dual wield passive (unique to ninjas for learning) and some ninja abilities, then carried over those abilities so she was a fighter with dual wield, fighter abilities, and ninja abilities. Another example would be teaching a Red Mage doublecast and then changing their job to Summoner so they could doublecast summons. It's fun, it provides a lot to do out of battle, and I find the grind incredibly relaxing. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of FFV, which I think has the best implementation of jobs out of any FF game.   Tales of Symphonia had each character lean between technical and strike depending on what abilities they used. For the MC, leaning towards technical gave him upgraded versions of his basic skills (He has a basic multi hit attack called Sword Rain, and going technical gives him things like ""Sword Rain: Beta"" which is a stronger Sword Rain with more hits) and going the strike route gave him skills that were combinations of skills (Sonic Thrust was a strong thrust attack that pushed back an enemy, and Sonic Sword Rain was a Sword Rain followed by a Sonic Thrust.) If you were good at combos, going technical didn't make things bad, but if you were a beginner, you'd usually end up as strike and wouldn't have to worry about it as much.   The ex skill system from Tales of Symphonia felt almost entirely useless though. Like, I didn't even touch it if I didn't have to, and I felt like it punished players who wanted to experiment since IIRC you need spheres to activate it and you couldn't remove them -- only destroy them.   Kingdom Hearts Re:coded is probably the most interesting of anything I've played. You get this wonky thing and each of your level up, attack, magic, and defense and spell chips you earn go on one of the gray spots, and throughout the game, you unlock the big parts of the matrix as you play. There's a difficulty slider, a way to change drop rates in exchange for HP, a way to make enemies stronger, a way to drop everyone's (yours and enemies) HP down by percentages to keep fights fast, etc. It was a bit of a diamond in the rough, but I thought it was fantastic and definitely was fun to watch as I could throw down more and more level up chips and push through the matrix, not to mention how well it integrated with the story of the game."
JRPG,3ckb3l,aett,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"The skills you used in Symphonia didn't effect your technical/strike meter, it was actually the EX skills that you had equipped, and each EX level had two S skills and two T skills, and whichever you had more of is what your character would lean to.  Also, the solo EX skills were relatively useless, but the compound EX skills (skills that activated when you had multiple specific skills equipped) had the potential to break the game. IIRC in the Gamecube version a certain compound skill for Zelos/Kratos would allow you to infinitely combo a single enemy to death."

It actually made the game a little more interesting. Like in Lloyd's case, you could get a better balance of hits vs ending lag on moves and such, which was really useful for comboing during a solo playthrough. You can actually acquire every spell for Genis other than 1 or 2 and it really evens out his damage capability late game when enemies have more variance in elemental weaknesses.

JRPG,3ckb3l,Xujhan,2,Thu Jul 9 00:45:25 2015 UTC,"I was a pretty big fan of the Brave/Default system in Bravely Default. Using the Brave option lets you take up to 4 actions at once, but then your character is stuck for 3 turns doing nothing while you wait for your action to regenerate. Alternatively using Default lets you defend for up to 4 actions at once. The nice thing about this is that you're defending for those 4 turns that are taken up by the action. The bad thing about this is that you're defending for those 4 turns - you can't stop Default until it has completed.   The other big pro and con to this system is that as you grow in levels and job levels, you can easily win a fight in one turn with your entire party all using full Brave and making 4 attacks each. It does detract from the difficulty though, and I found by the end of the game the only real challenge was in boss fights.

The game was balanced around you using those frontloaded braves.  In your average RPG, a random encounter can be wiped out in 1, maybe 2 turns.  In BD, it was the same thing if you frontloaded that first turn with FOUR TURNS worth of actions.  Every single random fight had me putting in 16 action commands and watching 16 animations, then if by some strange happenstance everything didnt die?  Time to sit on my hands for four turns until anyone can do anything.  It's way more effort for the exact same gameplay.

Basch was only the game's primary protagonist in very early concept sketches. Matsuno put Vaan in very early. What people don't realize - partly because FF12 is actually subtle about its storytelling and character development and doesn't feel the need to put in long and demonstrative scenes, unlike every other JRPG - is that he's there to act as a foil to Ashe. Both characters lost someone precious to them and were stripped of everything due to the Archadian invasion. At Jahara, Vaan admits that he was so overcome by his powerlessness that he became obsessed with his desire to become a sky pirate, just to distract himself from the reality of his situation. He's able to accept his losses and seek peace rather than revenge, as his interactions with Larsa illustrate. Ashe, on the other hand, remains caught up in her own dream of using nethicite to forcibly take back what's hers - during the scenes atop the Pharos, Vaan acts as her conscience and wordlessly stops her from cutting away nethicite with the Treaty Blade. In the end, the only revenge taken is by Zecht, against the Occuria, for their manipulation of humanity. So, yes, even the seemingly pointless characters keep Ashe in check.  If any character is pointless, it's Fran - past Golmore she serves basically no purpose."
JRPG,3cl58j,RNGmaster,3,Thu Jul 9 00:22:56 2015 UTC,"Vaan was very much not superfluous.  This is the best explanation of the game ive ever heard:  The story of XII is a lot like a play rather than a book or a movie. Ashe is the female lead and Balthier is the male lead.  It's a pretty common tactic in a lot of famous plays to not introduce the main characters until several scenes in, and rather start off the exposition with your Francisco and Bernardo, C3-P0 and R2-D2, your Tahei and Matashichi (The Hidden Fortress is a great movie and was probably a big inspiration for FFXII and ofc Star Wars, I highly recommend it). This is how Vaan and Penelo are used.  They also serve an extremely important purpose in the overall plot acting as a humanizing element for the Dalmascan people, representatives of the common folk caught in the crossfire of this international conflict. Looking to Vaan is what keeps Ashe grounded and able to resist the belligerent temptations of the Occuria, and looking to Penelo is a huge part of what makes Larsa so sympathetic to the Dalmascan plight and try so hard to find a resolution through nonviolence and diplomacy. Having Vaan and Penelo around makes it impossible to write off the common people.  Personally I don't think Basch was ever supposed to be the main character. He is the disgraced/exiled hero with unfinished business, Obi-Wan Kenobi/Makabe Rokuruta. His arc is very much a side story that revolves around him dealing with Gabranth, feeling like he must atone for his brother's sins to make up for his own failure. He doesn't have a conflict with Archadia or Vayne themselves like Ashe and Balthier do, nor does he have much bearing on the advancement of the plot. Ashe is the one who everything hinges on, and Balthier is usually the one coming up with the plan and moving things forward. Basch is actually a lot like Vaan in a way, along for the ride and lending help when he can in order to get a chance to confront Gabranth."

JRPG,3cl58j,RNGmaster,4,Thu Jul 9 05:21:49 2015 UTC,"The first thing I really love about the game is the presentation. The visual design is unbelievably gorgeous and memorable, the music is one of Sakimoto's best scores, and the fact that each monster has a bestiary entry giving information on its role in local legend or its economic uses (for example) gives an impression that a lot of love and effort went into making Ivalice seem like a real place. It's the only game world I'd live in, to put it that way.   One of my favorite aspects of the setting is the subtle, unanswered hints at the world's past - precursor races aren't unusual for JRPGs, but when you walk into Giruvegan and see the vast alien buildings off in the distance, and then you warp in and are walking on these giant ramps on the edge of this gigantic abyss, with tiny lights glimmering off in the distance... I've never played a single game that has captured the feeling that you've stepped into a place not meant for humans as well as Giruvegan and the Pharos do. Areas like Mount Bur-Omisace and The Salikawood also have this majestic, fantastical feeling.   The story is really great because it's ambiguous and doesn't shove an annoying romance plot or overt villain in your face. There's a number of themes, but it's mostly a game about power and control on various levels, most obviously the Occuria trying to guide humanity's future. The joke that it's just a retelling of Star Wars rings hollow to me - the setup is the same, but it's not a game about fighting Archades, it's about Ashe and Basch trying to restore their dignity and the world they remember, without letting power take them over. And it's about Reddas trying to redeem himself, and Fran trying to come to terms with being abandoned by the world she belonged to, and Vaan acting like an asshat, and Larsa trying to start a peace movement despite being fucking 12.  In gameplay terms, it's pretty solid. The International version fixes some of the complaints (for example: the License system was poorly thought-out and should have kept with the idea of LP as a limited resource, and the damage limit is just fucking dumb) and the handling of 3D free-moving combat is great. Criticizing the Gambit system makes no sense to me, since I just autobattle my way through most encounters in other JRPGs - rarely does a game require me to put strategic thought into each encounter, and when I do it's a bit tedious to do x pattern every time I come across y enemy group. (Speaking of which, I adore the fact that enemies actually interact with each other, and sometimes even fight with each other! Another thing that adds depth to the game world.) FF12 streamlines that while still giving the player the ability to micromanage to their desired degree. There's a number of acceptable playstyles, though the limited usefulness of most technicks and the lack of real postgame content (deeper areas of Lhusu/Henne and Pharos Subterra add up to a grand total of... not very much, and most optional bosses are tedium aside from a couple challenging encounters like Zodiark and Behemoth King) make replaying the game a bit of a chore at times. I also criticize some elements (Earth/Water and, for most of the game, Holy and Air) being totally unavailable to the player outside of summons and ammo - it ruins the elemental system they'd set up. Some of the other common criticisms, like the Zodiac Spear being missable, are only relevant to obsessive completists, and as far as I know all those people buy guides anyways.  The main problem with the game is tedium. There's way too much grinding and not enough to do besides combat. All the minigames are really low-effort and unengaging, the fishing minigame in particular is atrocious. You can make a great JRPG without minigames, but with a game world as big as FF12 the lack of stuff to do aside from wanton animal (and tomato) murder is a buzz kill. If they hadn't had Matsuno leave midway through, I feel like the game could have been so much more, and as it is it's already one of the ""biggest"" and deepest experiences I've had with a JRPG. So thinking of what could have been is painful in the same way that Xenogears fans feel about Xenogears."
JRPG,3cl58j,cmnamost,2,Thu Jul 9 06:17:23 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for taking the time to do that. I enjoy reading those kind of reviews. I think I know how you feel about most things -- I consider myself to be probably the equivalent level of FF13 apologist (Yeah, that doesn't win me very many internet points)"
JRPG,3cl58j,RNGmaster,2,Thu Jul 9 13:10:31 2015 UTC,"I liked 13 to a good degree and will agree that a lot of criticisms of it are off-base. The combat system, for example, is very well-designed and paced in how it hands out new abilities and then gives you encounters that require those abilities. It's dependent on skill and planning if you want to get good ranks (using aggressive strats, debuffs, ATB refresh, synthed weapons), even if almost all the combat does rely on the same implementation of the stagger dynamic.   As with FF12, it's a visual triumph. No surprise, since both games had Isamu Kamikokuryo as the lead visual designer, but in some cases 13 is even better than 12. Oerba in particular is gorgeous.   The linearity doesn't bother me, though the postgame is, again, lackluster compared to some other JRPGs. I also like most of the characters, and have never seen the dislike for Hope (though he's so cute that I can't really hate him even if he were obnoxious). Lightning is the only main offender, and that's mostly just because Motomu Toriyama basically designed her to be completely flawless because he's creepily obsessed with her.  My main problem is the story. It's not too incoherent, it just sort of falls apart towards the end when the characters start following Barthandelus's orders and are only saved with the ending Deus Ex Machina of Ragnarok. I don't care for the in medias res storytelling style or the use of datalogs to communicate the true story, either.  What are your thoughts on it, though?"
JRPG,3cl58j,cmnamost,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:28:57 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, where to start. We have to back up a bit.  If someone asked me to give details on my ideal type of game (specifically RPG), I'd say, open world, no time limit, lots of side quests, long story, lots to do, totally open, not linear, replayability, etc.  Now I have to step back and look at the games that I've enjoyed most, and completed without being able to put down, and I see some facts:   I've platinum'd FF13 and 13-2 (Screw 13-3's time limit!) I've bought the tomb raider reboot for ps3 AND ps4 I can't get enough of the Uncharted games I bought Skyrim on some steam sale for a few dollars and I probably stopped before the 10 hour mark. I couldn't tell you anything about the story if my life depended on it.   So. First of all, wtf? The ones that I played the most and were most fun for me are all linear, and there isn't so much as an open world as there are ""set pieces"" (tomb raider is the exception) and not that much replayability. Why is there such a difference in the styles of games that I think I like, and the games that I apparently actually like?  I've thought about this, and I've come to the conclusion that my initial assumptions of what I like in a game are wrong. What I actually want in a ""perfect"" game (or any media for that matter) are 2 things:  1) Incremental progression. I find this addictive. What I mean by that is by playing (example: battle system) you get points that you can spend on upgrading yourself at any time, and are not limited to grinding for levels. This also extends to Metroid-style games which I also love. Progression over time is something that I enjoy playing, and if the battle system is fun, I don't mind spending hours grinding. In fact, I have a game on Google's play store and I modeled it after that exact style of system.  2) The narrative is a puzzle. This one applies not just to games. What's really fun for me is a story that has a lot of background that can be figured out over the course of it. A book example is something like Harry Potter, or some kind of long epic where more and more backstory makes sense as you go. Bonus points if the reader can figure things out without being explicitly told. Another example is Cloud Atlas. I saw the movie an a plane and then immediately bought the book. The narrative itself IS the puzzle, which is all sorts of awesome. I don't consider myself an anime watcher, but my wife is, and I couldn't help but to tune in when she was watching one called Madoka Magika for the same reason. The plot twists all over itself like a puzzle again. Finally, an example of this in another RPG is Baten Kaitos for the GameCube. That game has to this day my favorite plot twist of all time. This is probably the best example of what I like because everything that happens from the beginning of the game takes on a new meaning after a certain point. It's the type of game where if you go back and play it again knowing what happens later, you understand why everything played out as it did.  Sorry about the long introduction.  The reason why I brought all this up is because the above 2 points are exactly what's found in FF13. That's one of the reasons why I like it so much. The other reason is I guess that most of the things that people have complaints about are things that don't necessarily bother me.   -First of all, I'd like to echo what you said about Oerba. That place was the first time in a looong time that I've stopped and marveled at the scenery (and spent too much time playing with the lens flare) -Sabre's Edge is probably one of my favorite pieces of music in any game ever. Especially @ ~0:51 and ~2:03.    I ""got"" the battle system; I think I understood what the developers were going for. Some complains are about the way you auto-battle but the point of the strategy is the paradigms. I got the incremental progression with the skill system and the upgrade system (don't have to grind for levels). Interestingly my biggest complaint with the game is here. It could have been so perfect if the upgrade materials and money weren't as heavily restricted as they were. You never have enough money/parts to upgrade all you want to until post-game, which is ridiculous. Basically there are accessories that you'd never want to touch because you'd do better to upgrade something else first and don't have enough for everything. I've heard complains about the voice acting, but I can't comment here because I only played the JP version, and the voices are not only good, I've never heard a better Japanese voice actor playing a black guy than this game. The linearity. This comes back to the ""open world"" VS ""set pieces"". It's interesting how similar this game is (linearity, skill progression etc) with FF10 and yet that one is universally praised. I think I can sum up this point and the whole FF13 experience comparing myself and those who didn't like this game as: They came into it with certain expectations that were not met. I came in with no such expectations. I came into this game saying ""tell me a story"", which will bring me to my last point... The narrative puzzle. I sure did get my narrative puzzle in this game! There are really 2 ""layers"" in the story. The first layer is the ""What were the sequence of events in the last 13 days that lead to the current situation?"" and that part is covered in the main game. The 2nd layer is ""What were the sequence of events over the history of the world that set up this whole thing?"" That part is only covered in those data logs. It would have been nice to expand those a little more but for me personally, that just would have been a bonus. I can see people playing the game thinking ""Why was Anima there in the first place?"" ""Why the hell is the evil guy helping you??"", ""Where do the Eidelons(sp?) come from?"", etc. The whole story doesn't make much sense if you start to question it without going into the extra lore information. If anyone wants to find out more and has a little bit of time, this FAQ actually answers all those things including things that people probably didn't even question in the first place, like why are the pulse fal'Cie flying around, digging, etc. I certainly can't fault people for not wanting to go into the lore, but there it is -- the 'puzzle narrative' reason why for me personally it is excellent.    Side note: I agree there are some cheesey things at the end, but in the game's defense, there is actually a reason why those things happen (intervention from the goddess Etro, like when the characters get their summon monsters, when their marks get scorched)) Cheesey? Yes, but not actually totally without thought, which is all I was looking for.    Now that I'm this far, I might as well keep going with FF13-2. My opinions on that game can be summed up as:   A better technical ""game"" The story is so stupid. Here's where they throw all of the crap in, like, ""OH, DID WE MENTION THESE THINGS ALSO HAPPENED TOO?"". It basically seemed like the production of the first game went on so long that they had a bunch of leftover assets and wanted to get a better return on investment from the game engine, so they just put everything they had in one game and then tried to write a story around why all these random assets could be in one game.     FF13-3:   I hate hate hate hate time limits. This game pissed me off playing it. It was a complete chore. The only reason why I finished it is because I had to see the story through to the end. Speaking of the story... The story for the last game was good GIVEN THE FACT THAT the second game screwed everything up. All the faults of the 3rd game's story stem from the fact that they had to write something that fit in with the 2nd game. Lightning's Japanese gets really difficult after she goes to Valhalla and becomes a servant of the goddess. It's like her vocabulary suddenly got all ""classic"". This one was really tough to understand for me."

But if your enjoyment of a game comes from customizing your stuff (party, loadout, skills/abilities) then IX is just not the right answer for many reasons. And it's just unfortunate that all they had to do was some minor changes: make steal work just slightly differently and everything would be okay."

It was so ridiculous where it got to the point where the difficulty of boss fights was not the boss fights themselves, it was whether or not I could survive long enough for Zidane to successfully steal.  I knew that I could kill the boss almost trivially if I really wanted to, but I have to defend/heal and wait for zidane to steal that item I really want."

JRPG,3cgakj,enigmatican,6,Wed Jul 8 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"I really like the steal mechanic from Omega Quintet.  The abilities that allow you to steal do more damage than regular attacks, so it never feels like you're wasting an action.  Besides potential rare items, enemies carry materials that can be used.  Materials can either be needed for crafting something, or you can just dissemble them for extra EP to use for repairs, upgrades, crafting, or quests.  In short, abilities that steal never feel like a waste, and there is always some use for whatever it is you steal."

Valkyrie Profile is one of my favorite obscure JRPG series, it only has two games - Lenneth for PSOne/PSP and Silmaria for PS2  Final Fantasy... duh  (Shin)Megami Tensei is one of those games where you can pick bits and pieces of and use.  Tales series is crucial because of the span of the series.  Chrono Series (Trigger, Cross, and Radical Dreamers)... duh  Suikoden had a good set of music, that's what I remember it from  Valkyria Chronicles is like Fire Emblem, but a bit more... modern  Mother is a necessary addition - most remember Mother 2, or Earthbound in the US.  Fire Emblem is the premier Strategy JRPG, more known than the Shining Force for Sega Genesis.  The Shining Series, more so the Shining Force subseries, was the answer to Fire Emblem. It was pretty good for Sega's take on the Strategy RPG genre until Valkyria Chronicles came out."

If I were to assemble such a list, I'd have to try not to include personal subjective opinion. For example, the Quintet trilogy is probably more on the mediocre side but I have tons of nostalgia wrapped up in it so I'd have a bias. On the other hand, I haven't played a Dragon Quest game I've really liked, but I recognize it's part of the class of the genre. Also in that category for sure are Final Fantasy, Pokemon, Persona, and Suikoden. Ys, Breath of Fire, Tales, Wild Arms, and Ogre, to name a few, are all debatable.  Then you have other questions like Chrono, which has two quality games and then an obscure side-story one. Does that meet the criteria for a ""series?"" Valkyrie Profile, Lunar, and Xeno have similar issues."

I couldn't do it. The battle load times, battle speed, and overdone battle animations killed it for me. I got to the Festival of the Hunt and gave up. It makes me sad because I was intrigued by the plot, characters, and world building. BUT, at the end of the day FFIX is a game and I refuse to play any RPG where I don't enjoy the game part. I can always get plot, characters, and world building from an epic fantasy novel. I wish there was a version of the game that sped up the battle animations, if nothing else.   I'm really glad that modern JRPG typically skip the BS and just make the turn based encounters brisk. I love turn based combat, I just don't want to watch elaborate spell casting animations and attack animations over and over. Bravely Default should be the model for all turn based JRPGs with character attack animations, going forward."

Aim to make a game that's not a rehash of the series, but rather one that represents your interests. Consider it an homage to video games that you have enjoyed, rather than a Legaia fan sequel.  If it helps, read TVTropes' article So You Want to be Original."
JRPG,3cejk5,gekiganwing,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:20:58 2015 UTC,"I wish more developers did this, instead of rehashing the same shit.  Bungie did it with Destiny, and it was a hit.  We don't need another Halo 7, we need a game that takes concepts from what Halo did right and what made it fun, with some new ideas mixed in (multiplayer cooperative loot grab, FPS raiding), and put it all in a brand new shell.  Oh hey look, it's fucking massively successful.  Imagine that."
JRPG,3cejk5,ffxivthrowaway03,5,Wed Jul 8 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"Legend of Legaia was always one of my favorite games, largely because of the combat. Though you left out the magic system, which I really loved. Everything was basically a summon spell, and you learned them from killing the corresponding seru. The spells also leveled up based on how much you used them.  Hopefully you played Legaia 2 for the PS2. It wasn't nearly as good as the original, though it may just be nostalgia talking. But they did improve the combat system a bit. Instead of having to 'spirit' every other turn, you had weaker abilities that gave you AP, and stronger abilities that cost AP. So you would have to combine the two, but it made the combat system a little quicker. Especially with the load times on the original, battles could seem like they were taking forever."
JRPG,3cejk5,Billyblack05,2,Tue Jul 7 09:46:37 2015 UTC,I got Legaia 2 a few years after it came out and I just could not get into it. Just so boring and lifeless compared to the first.
JRPG,3cejk5,Billyblack05,2,Tue Jul 7 09:48:26 2015 UTC,"It was definitely missing something (or a few somethings) that made the original great, but you should consider it for the combat.

The setting made the Mist out to be this terrible thing filled with dangerous monsters, and holy fuck, did it deliver. The game did not fuck around when it came to challenge. The amount of hesitation you feel when you enter a town that was still saturated in Mist is palpable.   Also, I don't remember the story being too cliche though!

JRPG,3cejk5,Geomancer_Invictus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"Man, Legia was my favorite game back in the day.  I got the demo from Toys R' Us and immediately petitioned my family to let me play it.  I never got to completing it till a couple years ago.  I feel that Legia 2 fell short, lacking the same charm.    I would like to see an adapted fight system where you customize seru to be more responsive and involved in battle, as opposed to just summoning.  Maybe make it work like Jade Cocoon where you could fuse them and customize them for battles.    Maybe if it doesn't work as a full on fighter RPG, you could adopt it into a dungeon crawler JRPG with the same fighting style?  Or a rogue like world builder?  There are so many awesome paths, and I would love to revisit that game."
JRPG,3cejk5,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Tue Jul 7 16:55:55 2015 UTC,"Jade Cocoon. That was another really cool game. PS1 era is still probably my favorite. Star Ocean 2, BoF 3/4, Persona 1/2, Xenogears, Saiyuki, Hoshigami, Megaman Legends. So many good titles."

I've always wanted to play it but never got around to it, and I'm not sure if a true to form PSX era JRPG would hold my attention if everything feels like you're doing it through ten pounds of molasses."

JRPG,3cawk1,ethernetcord,8,Mon Jul 6 15:37:10 2015 UTC,Which could in turn rejuvenate the entire JRPG home console genre! Well I am getting a little ahead of myself but I can dream
JRPG,3cawk1,phillippus,8,Tue Jul 7 01:54:01 2015 UTC,I hope they dont go the FF route and keep the game turn-based.
JRPG,3cawk1,MrGazillion,8,Mon Jul 6 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is the one series we dont need to worry about that in, thankfully."
JRPG,3cawk1,moogmagician,5,Mon Jul 6 21:36:56 2015 UTC,Well DQIX was originally going to be a an action adventure game (before the backlash) and then DQX is a MMO... I think there's some validity in being worried that they're trying to update the series.
JRPG,3cawk1,BatteryCap,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:09:41 2015 UTC,Japan would explode.
JRPG,3cawk1,MrGazillion,3,Tue Jul 7 05:28:46 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with turn-based?
JRPG,3cawk1,Blissfulystoopid,7,Tue Jul 7 11:07:32 2015 UTC,His comment wasn't very intuitive but he's saying that there's nothing wrong with the turn-based system -- Final Fantasy is trying to move away from it.
JRPG,3cawk1,phillippus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"While there is some validity to this fear as you say below, I think it's it's a safer bet in this case.  From what I've seen, once Square and Enix merged, these two franchises were handled very differently.  Final Fantasy was the grounds for experimentation; the series was known to mix things up a hit each game, and they simply took that much further.  Dragon Quest though, has always been about playing it safe. It doesn't have the history of changing battle systems and settings as heavily as FF does, it's main fan base are fans of it BECAUSE of what it does, and how well it does it."
JRPG,3cawk1,table-desk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"Well... There has been some fuck-ups with DQ IX and X regarding the ""trying new stuff"" department, but i guess you are kinda right that they're trying to be more traditional with it in opposition to FF."

JRPG,3cawk1,fanboy_killer,3,Mon Jul 6 20:25:44 2015 UTC,The Nintendo NX? The last DQ game in the main series on a PlayStation console was 11 years ago. Sure the PS4 is getting heroes but Nintendo consoles get way more DQ games so who knows.
JRPG,3cawk1,Edgebert,3,Mon Jul 6 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"the last Dragon Quest game to come to a home console that isn't a MMO was 11 years ago on the PlayStation.  Although it would be a killer game for the NX, in Japan at least"
JRPG,3cawk1,ZiegfredZSM,3,Mon Jul 6 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"Given the japanese market, it's weird that they are considering releasing DQ XI in a home console in the first place. Then again, if there's a series that can turn that situation around, that series is Dragon Quest."
JRPG,3cawk1,elPedroGrande,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:01 2015 UTC,They wouldn't release  it on a new console unless Nintendo was really shelling out some big bucks to SE to get them to put there game on it.

JRPG,3cawk1,VyseofArcadia,5,Mon Jul 6 17:02:52 2015 UTC,Don't forget DQ7 and DQ8 3DS are getting localized finally.
JRPG,3cawk1,moogmagician,4,Mon Jul 6 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"Still not officially confirmed but let's hope you're right. I'm one of the suckers who got a 3DS as soon as they released DQ VII in Japan. ""They will definitely localize it since VIII and IX sold really well in the west"". Still waiting."
JRPG,3cawk1,VyseofArcadia,3,Mon Jul 6 20:42:35 2015 UTC,My faith has been renewed since the ff7 announcement...but more importantly like I mentioned...Heroes. I will be back on the hate train if this doesnt get localized....thats for sure.

JRPG,3cawk1,gordallott,5,Tue Jul 7 00:30:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully not another franchise ruined by generic open world crap like The Witcher 3, and like FF15 is shaping up to be. Would be amazing if they could stick to the classic, working formula."
JRPG,3cawk1,rg90184,12,Mon Jul 6 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"generic open world crap like The Witcher 3   ??? Um, Farcry/Watch Dogs/Ubisoft made ""open world"" games are generic crap. The Witcher 3 is one of the shining examples of open world done right.  The sales of Elder Scrolls and Witcher games are proof that some people really enjoy open world RPGs.  That's not to say I want my JRPGs to all turn into open world romps, but I'm not opposed to one or two trying it out, who knows, maybe they'd do something amazing? shrug  I am sure that DQ will stick to it's classic formula though, they aren't much ones for change."
JRPG,3cawk1,Dan_Tsukasa,8,Mon Jul 6 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"The Witcher went from 30 carefully written, complex, and rich quest experiences in 2 to 300 quests of meaningless tripe in 3. I think a perfect comparison is the Succubus quest: in TW2, it's one of the best quests in the game, offering all manner of intrigue and reward. There are multiple important decisions to be made and a rich story to back everything up.  In TW3, you see that some guards are dead, follow a scent trail (for the 100th time), get lead to the succubus, and after 2 lines of dialog are presented with two options: ""It's time to die!"" or ""You need to get out of town. Now."" That's it. It really drives home just how badly they mangled the quests in this game.   The world is pretty though, I'll give them that I guess."
JRPG,3cawk1,adremeaux,5,Mon Jul 6 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"You've only done those small quests then because there are some amazing, long, and in depth side quests in that game."
JRPG,3cawk1,fanboy_killer,2,Tue Jul 7 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"That is a terrible way of comparing these games, you expect that just because succubuses are in both games that they should both feature long quests around them? I'm a huge witcher game fan, played them all and witcher 3 easily has the best most in depth quest design of the lot.   There are also in addition a lot of shorter quests but those serve to flesh out the world and do not negate the other much longer ones..   Honestly your point applies to games like the new dragon age where all you do is run out and find ten beans a thousand times but not witcher 3"
JRPG,3cawk1,adremeaux,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:50:32 2015 UTC,"I am sure that DQ will stick to it's classic formula though, they aren't much ones for change.   Agreed, they typically take the same mechanics and polish them to perfection."
JRPG,3cawk1,fanboy_killer,3,Mon Jul 6 19:22:40 2015 UTC,Wasn't Dragon Quest VIII basically open world too? Just bordering you off of certain areas until certain events? Its world map was certainly not like the standard JRPG world map.
JRPG,3cawk1,bubblegummonkey1,12,Mon Jul 6 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"No, DQ8 was still a very linear game. There is a big difference with maps you can wander around in a bit, and an open world game. DQ8 was linear progression straight through, with distractions on the side, closer to Xenoblade than anything."
JRPG,3cawk1,methamp,2,Mon Jul 6 16:15:20 2015 UTC,Dragon Quest IX could be very open world if you decided to do the side-quests instead of completing the main story. Before the last part of the game you were free to roam around and do dozens of quests.
JRPG,3cawk1,corymatthews423,2,Mon Jul 6 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really consider that open world. By that logic, FFX would be open world, too. The ability to return to previous parts of the game is very different than a completely open, non-linear world a la The Witcher or Skyrim."
JRPG,3cawk1,ethernetcord,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"In Final Fantasy X you don't have NPCs giving you side-quests long after you completed its town like in Fallout, Skyrim or Dragon Quest IX. DQ IX's main story is as linear as it gets; you can just stray away for the side-quests."
JRPG,3cawk1,lendrick,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"DQ hasn't changed drastically, besides DQX, unlike FF is not a series that tries to ""innovate"" with each installment."

JRPG,3cawk1,luthin2000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:01:56 2015 UTC,"Because the last entry was an MMO.  They would not run two directly competing MMOs concurrently.  Common sense dictates that it's not going to be an MMO.    As for the platform, PC JRPGs are also a thing that pretty much never happen.  It would be news if it was going to be on PC, not that it's not going to be on PC.  Whether its handheld or not, it's still a console.  A trend continuing is not news, deviation from the trend is news."

JRPG,3cawk1,Dan_Tsukasa,3,Mon Jul 6 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Common sense says that a product thats nearly identical and directly competes with a product you just released is not going to make the most money.  AKA two MMOs in a row is clearly not the ideal choice.  Common sense also dictates that they already said they were working on new DQ single player console titles months ago, so the next title they announce in that series is more than probably going to be one of those single player console titles they already told us about.  It's amazing how butthurt people get over this series.  You're providing evidence for exactly what I'm saying while telling me I'm wrong.  Either way, this still is not news.  Downvote me all you want, but this article might as well be ""Hey guys, they plan to keep making these games that they said they were going to keep making""   So yes, water is wet, news at 11."

JRPG,3cdky8,kizis-,12,Tue Jul 7 02:09:12 2015 UTC,Resonance of Fate and The Last Remnant are popping up in my head.
JRPG,3cdky8,amp3rsand,10,Tue Jul 7 02:31:36 2015 UTC,"God fuck the battle system in the Last Remnant. It could've been so good, but they fucked it so badly. ""Oh you need a heal or that squad is dead? You go last."" ""Oh you're trying to cast a heal pre-emptively since you know that squad is going to get hit by 4 squads of them? You go first."" Fuck. I beat that game by using an ultimate with 900 health left on my last squad, and everyone but the guy casting the ultimate dead. I would've died if it didn't kill him. 10/10 would rage again."
JRPG,3cdky8,atriax,4,Tue Jul 7 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's good in the sense that you're a commander.  You give directions but it's up to the individual squad members to execute them.  It's bad because... well, rage.  Also screw boss abilities that just blick your squad leaders and then their entire squad is down."
JRPG,3cdky8,comp2205,3,Tue Jul 7 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"I couldn't understand why they made such a cool battle system so darned obtuse, until I found out that it was originally supposed to be SaGa Frontier 3.  Then it all made sense."
JRPG,3cdky8,Astolph,2,Wed Jul 8 03:29:11 2015 UTC,I took it back to the store after playing it for an hour. Could have been such a good game.

JRPG,3cdky8,PelvoDelFuego,2,Tue Jul 7 12:14:36 2015 UTC,It scaled very oddly too.  I recall a boss fight that would cause a lot of issues if you were actually high level.  People who didn't grind at all got passed it really easily.

JRPG,3cdky8,samuraigaiden,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:07:59 2015 UTC,I've literally fallen asleep playing that game in battles. I would set up the commands then sit there waiting for all the commands to execute and just doze off and that was with the actions in fast mode.

Jokes aside, actually the game is a bit fun itself, you can recruit so many characters to play.

JRPG,3cdky8,Banzai_Buckaroo,10,Tue Jul 7 06:35:09 2015 UTC,"The battle card system in Baten Kaitos. Although the concept is simple, the possibilities are endless. As your deck gets bigger, you can rack up so many combos--just when attacking or defending, you need to keep in mind the elemental attributes of each card you're playing, how it fits into your combo, all the while trying to play numbers that let you have a run, or match up a bunch of the same numbers. You have to try to play your deck so you have a finishing move at the end of your combo (but that also corresponds to the element of your attack). By the end of the game you play 9 cards at once, giving you the opportunity to get a 9-card run, which increases your damage by... 200% if I remember? You can't exactly stop to think about playing the cards either, because you're timed.   Then there are the special combos. If you play certain cards right after one another either defending or attacking, you can produce a brand new card... Like playing a sword card and a fishing rod card will get you a mess of chopped up sticks. Goodbye fishing rod (why you're attacking with a fishing rod is also a mystery). Sometimes if you play the correct ones at once you'll get a really useful, or rare, card (and there are hundreds of these combos). But then the cards evolve on their own, too. Some of them get less valuable the more hours they're sitting in your deck (Fruit rots, fresh water goes stagnant), some of them get better (there's some weird stuff that evolves in your deck). Super strange system, and I love it. The magnus card system extends beyond simple battles--they can be valuable trade items, key items for the main story and/or sidequests, help you through dungeons, etc. Baten Kaitos was a flawed game in many ways, but its complex battle system is one of my favorites I've ever encountered."
JRPG,3cdky8,nihilofit,2,Tue Jul 7 04:05:08 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with Baten Kaitos was that there were too many times where you would just outright draw an awful hand and you'd get a Game Over because you couldn't do anything helpful with it (and being able to improve your deck outside of battle because lack of card availability).
JRPG,3cdky8,iamwall,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:20:09 2015 UTC,The only issue I had was that after a certain time you were too busy looking at the cards and rapidly  flicking the C-Stick and not watching the action anymore.

JRPG,3cdky8,CabooseTrap,2,Fri Jul 10 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"The one called Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean is the first one made. It's a stand-alone game, and it's the one with the great battle system.   The second one made, called Baten Kaitos Origins, still uses a magnus card system, but it's not nearly as fun, because they drastically simplified the battle system and took away many of the complex little details that made the first one so fun. It's technically a prequel, but I never finished it, because I got bored with the battles, and the story didn't make up for it. So I would recommend just getting the original one."

Love learning skills by using other skills, getting stronger depending on which abilities I use, the magic system, the monster system, learning abilities with robots and mystics.

Shadow Hearts 3 (deepest mechanics).  You can juggle and down enemies like Grandia 3, there's hit zones like Xenosaga 2, a FFX-esque turn system, an incredibly complex timed hit system that lets you make the timing more precise in order to increase multiplier (among other customizations), a magic equip system that is spectacularly convoluted, characters with their own movesets that can be combined in many ways, you can double up attacks or execute party combos with finishers..."

JRPG,3cdky8,Brittany_Delirium,6,Thu Jul 9 23:16:15 2015 UTC,The Tales series was super complex already but Xillia 2 took it to a whole other level with Ludger.     Learning what arte to use in the combo and what arte can be chained to another arte and learning who and when to tag with an ally and when it's safe to brake out of a combo to go for a mystic arte for 3 different weapons and artes is insane.     And the super elaborate a very elaborate leveling system and complex skill system    Couple that with a transformation with it's own set of skills and mystic arte and you get what might be the most complex (and fun) character in any JRPG i played.
JRPG,3cdky8,7mad,3,Tue Jul 7 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the mechanics of combat but that game felt really messed up in terms of balancing.

I usually don't care that much about battle mechanics, since I play JRPGs mostly for their stories and characters, but things are different for me in this game. The only downside (for me in particular) is that I get really frustrated failing to build longer linked chains. I always look at the combinations in the artes menu, but will end up failing by the 4th or 5th arte anyway."
JRPG,3cdky8,renatomunhozz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:21:51 2015 UTC,"Yep this, but with time you get used to it (specially after farming for the platinum which needs you to grind a lot of linked arte chains)."

JRPG,3cdky8,Mitchiro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the basic premise of the battle system, but I thought there was more to it than that, as you get farther into the game (I think at a certain point you would have a time limit to strategize before you attack (before you could wait forever) thus allowing for less time to consider your move, also I thought the location of your party members played an important role as well, **also there was the light and dark system changing which special moves you had at your disposal), I could be wrong though."
JRPG,3cdky8,kingdom18,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, I do remember that at the start of the game, you had unlimited time to move? Or time only went down when you moved or something. As you get further in, the game adds more mechanics, but I think in the end you had a few seconds to run up to the enemy and attack normally until time ran out, and you used a special move. You have access to different specials depending on if you're standing in shadow or light."

JRPG,3cbkg8,frogsocks,39,Fri Jul 17 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but I have a good one for this.  When I was 12 years old I rented a copy of Chrono Trigger from a local video store. I had it for 7 days, then had to return it to the shop. Now, in case any of you are too young to remember the 90s, this was back when saved games were stored on the actual game. Not in ""the cloud"", not on your console's hard drive, not on your memory card, on the actual plastic cartridge that went into your SNES. That meant that when my 7 days was up I didn't just have to return the game, I had to entrust all of my progress to a complete stranger. Now, I lived in a small town, so if I was lucky then no one else would rent that particular game until I had enough money to grab it again and maybe I could pick up where I left off, but there was nothing to stop someone from just rolling in, renting Chrono Trigger, and immediately saving over all of my hard work.  So with that in mind, I wanted to get as much out of those 7 days as I possibly could. Unfortunately this was during the school year, so my play time was pretty limited during the week, but I did the best I could. On the evening of the last day, I had found my way to 65,000,000 BC and I was absolutely determined to complete that chunk of the story and see what came next. I entered the Reptite Lair just after midnight, and it seemed pretty clear that if I could just fight my way to the end of it then I'd be able to get out of prehistory and get a glimpse of the next area before going to sleep.  Now, normally I'm pretty obsessive about game story stuff. I will talk to every NPC I can find, read every line of dialog, and meticulously make sure that I've gotten into every nook and cranny of a map before I move one. But on this night I was so desperate to get through to the next part of the game that I started skipping through dialog entirely. I just mindlessly mashed on the controller without reading a word of what everyone was saying. I was so frantic to get through all the text that I managed to completely miss the explanation that the key to defeating reptites is to hit them with light/electrical attacks to lower their defenses and then immediately follow up with a physical attack to take them out. As long as you know that trick, reptite enemies are no big deal. If you somehow lack that particular piece of knowledge, it's still possible to beat them, but they really become an insufferable grind.  As I crawl my way through the Reptite Lair at an agonizingly slow pace, I get the sense that I'm missing something important but I have no idea what it is. I know I could reload my save and go back to the village, but there's no guarantee that I'll be able to figure out what I'm actually supposed to be doing, and the further I make it into the dungeon the less appealing it is to go back and start over. I had no guidebook for the game, and no internet to consult for help. I was pretty well-equipped and a bit over-leveled for the area (thanks to my usual style of play) so I was in no real danger of dying, but my progress was just excruciatingly slow and the night dragged on and on. To make matters worse, my hazy and sleep-deprived state got me hopelessly lost and I ended up needlessly wandering in circles for ages, but finally I managed to get all the way to the boss of the Reptite Lair. Nizbel.  Nizbel.   A lot of Chrono Trigger fans don't even remember who Nizbel is, but it's a name that I curse the way that some people curse Ozma or Seymour Flux. My own stupidity and carelessness turned an utterly forgettable boss battle into an epic battle of endurance. I knew by then that I was definitely doing something wrong, but I didn't have the first clue what it was and I couldn't stomach the thought of giving up after I had come all this way. I systematically tried every spell I knew. Every combo, every tech, every item I had. None of them seemed to be effective. I hit him with lightning, but by the time I got around to trying a physical attack again the effect had long since worn off. Without the secret of the battle I was reduced to bonking him for 10 HP here and 20 HP there. Eventually I settled into a routine and the fight became a question of what would give out first. My supply of consumables, Nizbel's HP, or my ability to stay awake. As the minutes ticked by, I was always certain that Nizbel had to be about to die at any second. And the longer I played, the more invested I became. Giving up became unthinkable.  Before the battle ended I saw the sun come up.  It was after 6 AM when Nizbel finally fell. Six hours. I had spent six hours in the Reptite Lair. Any experience player could be in and out of there in no more than 20 minutes, and I had been trapped by my own incompetence for a quarter of a day. When I finally got my own copy of Chrono Trigger and was able to play the entire game at my leisure, I almost broke down crying when I realized the mistake I had made that night.  tl;dr rented a SNES game, skipped the wrong line of dialog and needlessly fought dinosaurs for six hours of my adolescent life that I'll never get back"

Further eat I ever got was the damn haunted Pirate Ship by he game upped in difficulty there, and pre Internet walkthroughs, I got stuck on those damn riddles a lot.

FF13 has a pretty slow start but it becomes decent once you get through the tutorials, it's also one of the prettiest games I've ever played.  FF13-2 fixed almost all the problems I had with FF13, with the main problem being the confusing story. Lightning Returns is probably the best from a gameplay perspective and it is amazing to see how much innovation was made with the battle system (focusing one a single, complex character versus having to use a party)."

I was so excited for the PS3 remaster that when it came out, I played for ~60 hours straight. Near the end, when all the side quests are available, I went to go start one by initiating a conversation with an NPC. I started talking to her when I realized I hadn't saved in several hours, turned down the quest at the moment to save, and went inside an Inn (to save). I went back outside to talk to her and (finally) start the quest when.... she wouldn't let me. By declining, the quest was no longer available and I missed several titles and costumes. I thought about restarting from my last save point and losing a few hours but I HAD JUST SAVED AFTER DECLINING THE QUEST.

JRPG,3cbkg8,DrossSA,4,Wed Jul 8 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy VII was my first JRPG, and I played it when I was around... 7-8 years old? Let's just say that I wasn't very savvy about the genre. So, I've been playing the game for a while and I'm in the Shinra building. It's time to escape via the elevator while Cloud beats the crap out of Rufus, but there's a boss fight in there that I could never, EVER defeat no matter what I tried. I made it to it's second stage a few times, but it didn't matter because I would die nonetheless. Why? Because I didn't knew that you could equip materia to other characters  I was playing the game only using regular attacks and Limit Breaks, while Cloud was my only source of magic damage. I still can't believe I didn't got bored out of my mind with every battle. Anyhow, one day after getting my ass kicked by the elevator boss once again I start figuring things out: ""Where do I get more long range attacks to hit him?"", ""Do I need Cloud's magic for this fight?"", ""Didn't I buy a thing called lighting materia? Maybe I can use it with another character"". And so I went into the menu and started pressing every option available that seemed related to materia (it was at that point that I learned that the menu system of FFVII wasn't very intuitive in certain aspects) until I get into the Materia tab and furiously mash buttons. Somehow I equipped a materia in Barret, but I was mashing the pad and I had no clue how, so I spent the next hour figuring out how the fuck do you give spells to party members.   I felt incredibly proud of myself for figuring it out, and I demolished the elevator boss in my next try. The fact that I remember that event so vividly is proof that this was my most dumbest moment playing a JRPG. The close second was when I found this Cloud weapon called Enhance Sword. But I was playing the Spanish version and there it's called ""Super Sword"", and for some reason I thought that a super sword HAS to be the best sword in the game, so I just stick with that one until I beat the game.   I miss those times :("

For me, playing them in reverse release order really helped me get in to it. The combat systems of the older ones can be a bit jarring, so mastering them in the newer ones actually helped me when attempting to navigate the older ones.

Still, when my best friend and fellow Suikoden fanatic volunteered to share a recruitment tip that he'd guaranteed I'd never discover on my own, I was all ears. And so I went home and followed his instructions: Sail to some island (it's been like 10 years, so I can't remember what it was called, but I remember it being kinda sparsely populated, almost cemetery-like? Or maybe it wasn't as depressing as I recall it being...), find some nameless guy that's standing around and looking like a completely regular, non-recruitable NPC, and talk to him 108 times.  After I'd skipped through his dialog maybe 50 times, it suddenly dawned on me that I was carrying out my friend's prank on myself.

But I've put the game down about 3 months ago now, and I have a ton more reasons not to pick it up again.  Reguarding P4G: if you can look up the door puzzle or whatever to pass it quickly, it's worth watching the ending. Or if you really don't want to, you can just watch a Lets Play or something. I advocate continuing purely out of love for the characters, so either way is fine."
JRPG,3c8u6h,satsumaclementine,6,Mon Jul 6 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate but understandable people struggle to get into the Resonance of Fate story. I personally love it, and rate it among my favourite games, the story and all. But there is this chasm between what people expect out of a JRPG and what RoF delivers, both in the gameplay and in the world and the story.  In a JRPG you expect to play a hero who saves the world or is otherwise crucial and is tasked with overcoming some great feat or felling some great evil or something like that. Nothing like that happens in RoF but the world is presented in a way that you expect it. Like in the second intro scene (if you let the game idle in the ""press select to continue screen"") you are introduced to this giant god computer that is implied to control people's lives. That's exactly the sort of final boss you'd have in a JRPG. You'd expect that the storyline would be of freeing people from this thing. But that never really happens in a way that the player characters would be in on it, at least. You are introduced to this world that is characterised as doomed and deteriorating and NPCs talk of the end of the world. Usually in a JRPG this would mean you are out to save it, or to save its people. But this never happens in RoF. There isn't even really a proper villain which kind of messes the final arc of the game (how do you have a final dungeon and final boss gauntlet if no one really is a villain in the story?).  The story is ""slice of life"" and really takes two playthroughs to ""get"" for how low in exposition the cutscenes are. Personally I love the direction of the cut scenes, of the characters being themselves living their lives rather than setting up stuff and explaining things to the player. There is foreshadowing and other conventional expository means but it keeps it subtle I think. To really ""get"" the climax and the ending I think you almost need two playthroughs which most players will probably not attempt even if the game kinda goads you to that direction with New Game Plus option and a dungeon you can only access with hexes you get from the final dungeon.  Personally, I love it that RoF subverts the common tropes and does something completely different than what is expected of the genre, but I get why people struggle to get into it. It's very different. I wish they made another game like that, or there were more games with similar narrative styles."
JRPG,3c8u6h,ethernetcord,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:58 2015 UTC,Well you made me want to play this game now
JRPG,3c8u6h,satsumaclementine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:34:28 2015 UTC,Check out some gameplay videos from YouTube to see if that's the kind of thing you hate or not. It's not the easiest game to get into!
JRPG,3c8u6h,satsumaclementine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:41:40 2015 UTC,"You deleted your response but I had written a reply already. (It was a good comment, I don't know why you deleted it!) Here it is anyway:  I think the poorest character is Sullivan. On one hand he seems indifferent to anything but his goal, but then they decided to give him an ""evil laugh"" to try and pin him as the villain. The whole arc trying to make him the second coming of Jesus is just out of place. Guess that whole Christianity-wanking is another JRPG trope.   It does play the tropes but I guess I didn't mind so much, being drawn to it anyway. Zephyr is maybe the most interesting character with the school shooting storyline that I don't recall seeing before in games, and they tried to do a realistic take on depression through him. The main trio's interactions—though ""overacted""—were interesting enough to follow, juxtaposed by the more gloomy interactions in the Rowan storyline.    JRPG that doesn't follow character archetypes, that would be something I'd like to play too, but not sure one exists. o_o; Folklore maybe?"
JRPG,3c8u6h,draekia,3,Mon Jul 6 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"Same problem for me with eternal blue.  I ended up beating it, eventually, but it took my going back to an earlier save and grinding a bit.    After that experience, I made myself promise to just cheat next time I was being held back by the need to grind. Don't care what people say, I think a game left unfinished due to the grind fest is a lot worse than a game where you hack your way past it at the end. It's my time and experience, after all."
JRPG,3c8u6h,bendmorris,2,Mon Jul 6 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many of us are out there that didn't level enough before the final dungeon in Eternal Blue.  Final dungeon encounters were kicking my ass, finally made it through, fought the last boss, absolutely no way I'm going to win this one. Load my only save which is toward the end of the dungeon, fight my way all the way back through to the beginning, only to discover...there's nowhere else to go, you're basically fucked. Never did go back and beat that one.  At least I know I'm not alone."
JRPG,3c8u6h,Quikheat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:10:48 2015 UTC,There should have been a shrine to Althena on the dragonship which should have been outside of the final dungeon.
JRPG,3c8u6h,bendmorris,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:43:56 2015 UTC,"You're right, but what I really needed was to restock on healing items which I had used up making it through the dungeon. Presumably I could've made up for it with tons of grinding near the entrance and returning to the shrine, but that didn't really appeal to me."
JRPG,3c8u6h,hayashirice911,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"Resonance of Fate suffers from some bad, drawn out pacing IMO.  For all of the charm the world and the characters hold, it cannot hide its absolutely grindy and repetitive nature. The combat was fun, but I feel that there is way too much of it and much of the strategy starts to become lacking after a while."
JRPG,3c8u6h,ethernetcord,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:07:26 2015 UTC,"I've been at the beginning of the final dungeon in FF8 since 1999. Even have my save on a memory card still. When they take all your abilities away except attack I was just like, ""meh fuck it"". I even have fired it back up a few times with the intention to beat it but then I always just turn it back off saying ""meh fuck it."""
JRPG,3c8u6h,GhoostP,3,Thu Jul 9 05:32:33 2015 UTC,"I have to, and it kills me with finishing games.  If I forget what's going on with the story though, I don't feel right picking up where I left off."
JRPG,3c8u6h,Beats_ByRayRice,2,Mon Jul 6 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yes I do this, but only if I was a couple of hours into the game. Otherwise the time I have already invested into the game is wasted.

JRPG,3c8u6h,EpsilonX,2,Mon Jul 6 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"It depends on why I stopped playing.  A lot of times i'll fall off of a game, and when I go back to it I generally want to start fresh.  Sometimes, however, I get super into a game but need to take a break for a bit.  In that case, I just go back to it."
JRPG,3c8u6h,dangerdangle,2,Mon Jul 6 00:30:26 2015 UTC,I usually just continue because I'd probably just end up in the same situation again if i started over   I'm bad at finishing one game before starting another so I've picked games back up after anywhere from 1 month breaks to yearly breaks.   My worst example is how I only get the urge to continue FFXIII maybe one month every year. So I've finished a few chapters a year.    Main reason I stopped selling games.
JRPG,3c8u6h,phatboisteez,2,Mon Jul 6 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"I think the only game I did that with was Dark Souls, other than that, I try to beat my games within a reasonable amount of time. If I had to take a long break, I'll start where I left off."
JRPG,3c8u6h,anh86,2,Mon Jul 6 01:41:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty good about not picking up a new game until I finish the last one but I will usually restart if I can't remember where I'm at in the story.
JRPG,3c8u6h,DrStunJosh,2,Mon Jul 6 01:43:24 2015 UTC,This entirely depends on the game. If its a FF or Persona game I will restart it just to refresh the story as a whole. But for aomething like Akiba Strip or Hyperdimension I will just keep playing (I actually need to go back and finish these two specifically but I am too much on Persona 4
JRPG,3c8u6h,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Mon Jul 6 12:24:48 2015 UTC,The only games I ever have this problem with are SMT games.  I usually have a good run with bags full of loot and then get brutally murdered by something unexpected right before I can save.  Get so frustrated I take a break and by the time I come back to the game I forget where I was or what I was in the middle of.  I end up restarting and soldiering through.
JRPG,3c8u6h,Callox,2,Mon Jul 6 13:18:20 2015 UTC,"No, but then again it may be a holdover from when I was a kid, and was so poor I literally had one game at a time. Even now I don't buy games until I finish the ones I own. I don't binge play games, but I almost never just up and stop playing it, either.   If I put down hard earned money on a game, one way or another I'm seeing those fucking end credits."
JRPG,3c8u6h,TheKingofHorror,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"I always just pick it up where I left off. I played FFXIII 2 until the final area and three years later finished it along with the paradox endings. Though I didn't remember how to play for a few hours, it came back to me."
JRPG,3c8u6h,Tommy758,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:35:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I usually do.  I just restarted Fire Emblem Awakening after not playing my 90 hours save for several months.
JRPG,3c8u6h,12thCenExcaliburrr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"I usually will if it's my first run of a game, so I can get the ""full experience"" rather than a broken up one. Also because I'll probabaly have forgotten too much stuff and don't want to struggle until I pick everything up again. Although sometimes I might not restart if I'm super far into it, because then I feel sad wasting all the time invested into it earlier. If it's a 2nd or later run, then eh, I probabaly won't because I'm usually just playing it on the side for completion at that point."
JRPG,3c8u6h,deadering,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"I do, but I've made a few exceptions in the past. Usually though if I have not played in long enough to not be completely into the story I sort of fall into a weird place. Where it's too soon to restart but I could probably go back to the game and get into it rather quickly but can't bring myself to play it.  Usually I just end up shelfing it awhile and come back to it when I remember it's a game. Sadly this keeps me from beating so many, but I just can't help it!"
JRPG,3c8u6h,BomarJr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"....does FFXIV count? I feel like that's a cheap answer because its designed to be played that way, but I continued right where I left off even after nearly 1.5 yrs later"
JRPG,3c8u6h,starlizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:05:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on the game. I used to never go back to a game because it'd be too challenging to remember the gameplay or what was going on in the story. I now try and force myself to finish a game before starting another (or having 2-3 open games max, of different genres).   I quit Bravely Default right before the midway swing (Ch5) and then picked it up 6 months later right where I left off. It took a little bit to get used to the combat and strategies but not too long. I did not start that game over."

JRPG,3c8u6h,punkbrad7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:25:18 2015 UTC,"It really, really depends on the game. I recently restarted SMT3:Nocturne, and if I hadn't had a really out there clue (the magatama I had, and the candelabra), and certain level of demons, I'd have had no fucking clue where I was in the game.   Some games make it really easy to drop and pick up, and others make it damn near impossible."

Usually I'll just put all my time into a single game though."

I'd forget wherever the hell I'm at in the story, or just want the story is about in general and thus the immersion.  Everything else I can get to understand again, i.e. gameplay, but story wise, that I have lost and thus need to play again.  This actually happened when I was playing Atelier Iris and I got distracted and started playing another game. After months I started Atelier Iris and I had no clue where I was in the game and what I was supposed to do. I walked around for an hour to see if I could trigger an event, but nothing, so I ended up putting it back on the shelve."

JRPG,3c8u6h,bluestreak2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:03:09 2015 UTC,"It usually depends on how far into the game I was. If it was less than 5 to 10 hours and has been long enough that I can't remember the story, then I would just go ahead and restart it. If I had already made it further than that, the decision to restart becomes a bit more difficult. At that point I usually hope that a game has a diary which I can use to refresh myself on the story. The game that comes to mind for that was Tales of the Abyss.   To prevent these types of situations from happening, I will tend to only have 2-3 games going at the same time, and only one of those can be a 30+ hour JRPG. My current one has been Bravely Default and I've been playing it off and on since December. My breaks away from it tend to be about a month or two at a time, but it has D's Journal, so it isn't too hard to refresh myself when I come back to it."
JRPG,3c8u6h,corymatthews423,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:45:09 2015 UTC,"It really just depends on the game for me.  If I was not that far into it anyway, I will probably restart.  If I was already like halfway through though I usually will just pick up where I left off, and if I am confused I will just look up a quick refresher online or something to remember where I was and what was happening plot wise.  Some games have good ways to deal with this anyway, for instance Tales of games which I love playing have an easy way in game to look up what you were doing even if it has been a while.  Games I am really interested in I usually will finish all at once in the first place, so usually this kind of thing only happens on games I was not that into to start with."

JRPG,3c8u6h,RevRay,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on how complex the battle system is and how linear the story is.  Some games you can jump right back into because the battle system is easy and its not hard to remember or figure out where you need to go. Some games its really hard because your save is somewhere random on the world map and you keep going to towns trying to remember what the next move is but all you're doing is talking to unhelpful town citizens.  Likewise, if a combat system is really complex you might have a hard time succeeding once you come back to play. If its an old school JRPG you'll almost never have a hard time with it, but if you're playing a game with a huge party and/or lots of options it can be difficult coming back and relearning all of that well after all of the tutorials and tips have happened.  Games I've dropped or restarted because of story: FFIX (not a complex story but was saved at a random spot and had no real idea where to go), FFIV, Persona 4 (couldn't figure out how I was doing with the social links).  Games I've dropped or restarted because of the combat: Resonance of Fate (good luck jumping back into that game 3 months later), Lightning Returns (more of a mix of story and combat, luckily I'm not far so when I do go back I won't be replaying too much)."
JRPG,3c8u6h,pitman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Did this with Persona 3, had a save file at about level 40 MC and this was on the non-FES game so I just started P3FES and used that save file thanks for the save-file import feature and played it all the way through."
JRPG,3c8u6h,gospelexe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I mostly end up restarting the game to recap myself in the battle system, story, equipment, etc. Sometimes it's a little too much.

JRPG,3c8u6h,linktm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"I've never done this, but I almost wish I would for some games.

Ni No Kuni Persona 2, Pt. 1  Just to name a few. It's extremely intimidating to go back and play them, although some (like Persona 2) are linear-ish enough that I probably could pick it up easily. Things like DQ8, Star Ocean 3, and Fire Emblem PoR are trickier because they have all the weird little systems like romances, supports, alchemy, etc. that make it more difficult to just wing it without knowing what you were doing last."
JRPG,3c8u6h,Alphacraze,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"I do this so often,though I'll press on if I feel like I'm nearing the end (Happened with HDN:V and Magna Carta 2). I always have multiple concurrent JRPGs across a good 5 systems, so it's pretty common for me to not touch a game for upwards of 3 months to even a year after starting. Usually I'll start an RPG and play it for a few hours after getting it, but then restart the game and play it through once I feel like I can get around to it. Even so, I'm basically putting off the games for at least a year... Maybe I'll start at wikis (in moderation) when I try to come back to a game.  Speaking of, I really need to play SMT IV but got lost once I hit 40 hrs/lvl ~30. Haven't touched it since launch, since I got lost. :("
JRPG,3c8u6h,SupaStaVince,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:59:56 2015 UTC,Depends on the game and how much time I have invested in it. But I usually do this with most games. One game I haven't restarted with long breaks between sessions is Xenoblade.
JRPG,3c8u6h,magmafanatic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:33:18 2015 UTC,I absolutely restart unless I feel like I've played through half the game and don't want to make up THAT much progress.
JRPG,3c8u6h,Megidolan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm part of the minority but I continue from where I left it. Sometimes I give some game a break, especially an RPG, because there's too much grinding involved, or simply I get in the mood for a different setting, for example, a medieval to a sci-fi, or just a different type of game.  I think if I would have restarted the games I gave a too long break I wouldn't have finished half of my RPGs."
JRPG,3c8u6h,ethernetcord,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:16:34 2015 UTC,NEVER RESTART. The only way I ever beat JRPGs is picking up where I left off because I ALWAYS take long breaks. For example it took me from 2008 to 2013 to beat Persona 3 FES. Most JRPGs take me more than a year to beat because I get bored with them and move to something else then come back later. Just read a quick summary of the story from wiki to catch you back up. I have also found that just running around fighting random battles for 20 minutes or so is all you need to get re-acclimated to the battle system.  Not to de-rail the topic but what games have you guys ever beaten all the way through without taking a break? The only one I have ever done that with was Persona 4.
JRPG,3c8u6h,underpantsviking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:29:18 2015 UTC,"For me it all depends on my mood. I've just taken a 7 week break from Xenoblade Chronicles and have found myself picking up right where I left off. I've had to jog my memory on how to do a few things and where to go, but I picked a good game to do with with. There are so many (an obscene amount) of side quests that it's a bit of a cheater. I remember when I took a long break from Ni No Kuni and Tales of Xillia I restarted them both. A lot of the time though, sadly, I just give up and move on. My OCD really hates that."
JRPG,3c8u6h,jeitron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, usually whenever I play a long rpg, I play it from start to finish in a few sittings no matter how good or bad because of the competitionist in me.

JRPG,3cag4f,4shitaka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:46:28 2015 UTC,I only have a week or two to play video games left (leaving on a mission for two years.) Should I play FFVI or Chrono Trigger?
JRPG,3cag4f,Pumatyger,2,Tue Jul 7 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"FFVI or Chrono Trigger...  There would be easier questions on a Advanced Calculus IV test written completely in Latin.  Personally, if I were in your shoes, FFVI.  But, with that said, if you have two weeks, and you power game it, you may be able to do both.  I think FFVI has a deeper combat system than Chrono Trigger but CT is a little shorter with a more compact story line.  Both have Excellent characters and overarching plot lines."

JRPG,3c6eu0,johnny_fortune,17,Sun Jul 5 07:18:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really see a point of this. If they wanted a successor to the Chrono games, they would just make another Chrono game. The series has been dormant long enough that it would be welcome, and a game with that name would sell much better than a new IP. It's not like Final Fantasy, where the series has strayed so far from its roots that they needed a successor to continue the good old days. It's a dead series that might as well get an official continuation.   So no, I don't buy this at all.   But then again, Square Enix doesn't work on conventional logic."
JRPG,3c6eu0,CrispyPixel,2,Sun Jul 5 10:24:25 2015 UTC,"Besides I don't want to see Nomura and his pals making the new Chrono game in fact I don't want to see modern SE having anything to do with a Chrono game at all, unless they give the game to Level-5 or silicon studios."
JRPG,3c6eu0,bubblegummonkey1,3,Mon Jul 6 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how Nomura has destroyed square enix? Or are you doing what everyone else does, and just blaming him for a tonne of stuff that has nothing to do with him?"

JRPG,3c6eu0,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"He destroyed Square Soft, not Enix. Nomura's style is vastly different from the earlier SquareSoft works and, as evidenced by CC, modern Square style doesn't really work with Chrono series. And it was back in the end of 90s, now it would be even more different.  I like Nomura, but he should really stay away from CT unless he is ready to commit completely, embracing the original spirit of the game. Like Radical Dreamers did, but Chrono Cross ultimately didn't."
JRPG,3c6eu0,demafromua,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:54:20 2015 UTC,"As Evidenced by CC, Nomura did the character art for Crisis Core because he also did the Character art for the original FFVII, its not like he came in and ruined someone elses work, its his own work.  Plus all he did was character art, not like its his fault the game retconned the lore of VII is it.  Chrono Cross wasn't quite the same as Trigger its true, but thats unrelated to Nomura, and that happened when it was still Square Enix."
JRPG,3c6eu0,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"CC meant Chrono Cross, not Crisis Core (that would be FFVII:CC) ;) What I meant is that when Cross was made, Square was already very different and Nomura just pushed the differences further. Should they make a new game now, that would be even further from what Trigger and Radical Dreamers were. Which would make it not a Chrono game at all.  Actually, they could make a 3D remake of Trigger. Like Chrono Ressurection, except official and on modern hardware. But I don't think they ever will."
JRPG,3c6eu0,demafromua,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:31:16 2015 UTC,"But Nomura hasn't pushed differenes in Final Fantasy, he did art for VII VIII and 10, along with XIII but he didn't write the stories, the systems, the dialogue he only did the characters visuals.  All his main work is kingdom hearts and mobile."
JRPG,3c6eu0,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:01:15 2015 UTC,"OK, I may associate all the differences in Square with Nomura's person. What I mean by his name is a whole new direction of the company.  But he still supervised story for FF VIII (one of the most confusing titles in history of FF) and that is enough for me to be vary of him for Chrono - if he couldn't make such a simple time travel story work, what would happen if he had worked on a such massive installment as Trigger?"
JRPG,3c6eu0,demafromua,0,Sun Jul 19 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your point at all. Maybe they just don't want another Chrono game, but they want something with a new story in the same general vibe. Get old fans and new fans both on board."

JRPG,3c6eu0,CitrusChrome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:21:40 2015 UTC,"final fantasy 7   And if you google Final Fantasy you'd get 100 000 000.

JRPG,3c6eu0,CitrusChrome,2,Sun Jul 19 11:56:14 2015 UTC,That still doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of younger players who haven't played it OR that they may still want to make a new story. Xenoblade was critically acclaimed but they're making a spiritual successor rather than a sequel.
JRPG,3c6eu0,calgil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"Again, it can be a chrono game and have a new story, which was the point crispy was making.   Spiritual successor doesn't make sense when chrono games don't have tied stories."
JRPG,3c6eu0,CitrusChrome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:51:52 2015 UTC,"Whoa, whoa. They do. Their stories are actually extremely tied up in the background - the story of RD or CC (whatever you like more) is a direct continuation of the Chrono Trigger through Kid's (Shalla) story. And Chrono Trigger DS even makes a point of tying with Radical Dreamers in the Dream Eater ending."
JRPG,3c6eu0,demafromua,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:40:13 2015 UTC,"What you're saying has been contested forever. Here is a thread talking about it. Google will bring many more, even if it was a bridge it's still a super niche text based game that would probably never be considered part of the canon, but it really doesn't change the fact that they could make another chrono game without continuing the story of chrono trigger, which was the original point made."
JRPG,3c6eu0,CitrusChrome,0,Sun Jul 19 11:58:51 2015 UTC,"""I wouldn't really see a point of this.""  Money. Do you not think they would make millions off doing something like this?"
JRPG,3c6eu0,Joe_Ballbag,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"No? They would make significantly more money if they made a real Chrono game. Something with an established brand and fan base, instead of making something similar, under a new IP."
JRPG,3c6eu0,CrispyPixel,0,Thu Jul 9 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"I think you underestimate the power of nostalgia, and the average age of gamers these days. Anything even remotely associated with Chrono Trigger would sell like hotcakes."
JRPG,3c6eu0,Joe_Ballbag,2,Thu Jul 9 02:00:24 2015 UTC,But that's just what I'm saying. The power of nostalgia would work a lot better if they named it Chrono. A spiritual successor wouldn't be as powerful as a true sequel.

JRPG,3c6eu0,KotakuSucks2,7,Sun Jul 5 09:18:49 2015 UTC,They went out of their way to stress that the game was a new IP completely disconnected from any of their popular franchises.  What would be the point in saying that if its just a spiritual successor to one of their most well known franchises (even if it only had 2 games).  Also why would they need to make a spiritual successor when they own the rights to the original?  They could make an ACTUAL successor.
JRPG,3c6eu0,m00fire,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:16:34 2015 UTC,The only real connection I can see is that this project is a throwback to older RPGs and Chronotrigger is one of the most successful older RPGs.  I would imagine that it will try to capture recreate the feel and atmosphere of Chronotrigger since a lot of people still consider it to be Square's greatest work.  I'd expect influences from other stuff such as the old Mana and Dragon Quest games along with Chronotrigger since they have stated that this is what they are going for.
JRPG,3c6eu0,KotakuSucks2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:47:29 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly still surprised Square hasn't tried to revive Mana as a Souls knock off considering how popular they are right now and how revered Mana is as a franchise.

JRPG,3c6eu0,fanboy_killer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:25:19 2015 UTC,Their approach to this series is pretty weird. It's one of their most beloved IPs and the two entries actually sold pretty well. They milked Final Fantasy XIII ad nauseum and can't do a thing about Chrono?
JRPG,3c6eu0,Jamaz,3,Mon Jul 6 15:36:16 2015 UTC,I've always kind of assumed the original writers and directors for Chrono Trigger have retired over the years and there's really no one left to spearhead the company for a sequel. SE probably sees CT as an incredibly important IP (like FF7) and swat away any mediocre ideas unless it's presented by a senior elite member.
JRPG,3c6eu0,tradesojack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"The writer for Chrono Trigger and the writer/director for Chrono Cross (also the guy that did Xenogears, the first Baten Kaitos, and bits of FF7 and FF11) is freelancing now. His latest is a 3DS title, called The Legend of Legacy, that's making its way over to the West shortly.  I think, if anything, we'd be more likely to see a reboot of the series or a remake given today's climate. If FF7's remake succeeds, I wouldn't be surprised to see them go to back to the well for their other old properties like Chrono."
JRPG,3c6eu0,fanboy_killer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"In part, I'm glad they are not touching Chrono. Time travelling is pretty had to nail down and judging by the attrocious narrative work they did on Final Fantasy XIII-2, they have no idea how to properly tackle the subject. I've recently rraed Stephen King's 11/22/63. Such a good book about time travelling."
JRPG,3c6eu0,Jamaz,3,Wed Jul 8 08:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Chrono Trigger actually handled the Time Traveling exposition extremely well for a Japanese RPG, especially at a time when narratives for games were very basic. It managed to capture a lot of revelations, twists, and emotion whereas in FFXIII-2 it just felt like ""just another map""."
JRPG,3c6eu0,fanboy_killer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"in FFXIII-2 it just felt like ""just another map"".   It probably was. The whole game looked quickly put together to make a buck. The narrative felt like something they quickly came up with to glue everything together."

There's little benefit to porting old stuff to those folks. The 3DS audience is bigger (especially in Japan, where DQ actually sells well) and that audience is less likely to have already bought and played the game.   I get that PS4 fans want more games, but it doesn't make a lot of sense in cases like this. More likely is an online PS release for Vita+PS3+PS4.

JRPG,3c1o4n,bureburebure,7,Sat Jul 4 01:29:30 2015 UTC,Game by Skullgirls devs  Inspired by Super Metroid  Featuring Secret of Mana composer   TODAY IS A VERY GOOD DAY.

JRPG,3c1o4n,mysticrudnin,0,Sun Jul 5 05:57:45 2015 UTC,I'd be more interested if it had a different art style. I really hate Lab Zero's overall sense of style. I'll probably ignore it due to that alone.

JRPG,3c0qtt,jrsherrod,9,Fri Jul 3 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"How does the saga series stack up against other square rpg's?  I remember buying saga frontier when it came out and trading it in within a week or two, but I was also like 12"
JRPG,3c0qtt,irs320,5,Fri Jul 3 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"The Romancing SaGa series is pretty much Square's open-world counterpart to the more linear Final Fantasy. The story's pretty simple, but there are tons of side quests to unlock and complete. The game has more of an emphasis on gameplay and there's quite a bit of depth to the battle system. There are many characters to recruit, and they level up similar to Final Fantasy 2's system (use abilities more and they get stronger). As a result, the game has a fair bit of replay value, in that the game differs a bit depending on which main character you choose, which other characters you recruit, and which side quests you do.  Graphics-wise, they're pretty similar to the Final Fantasy games released at around the same time (RS1 = FF4, RS2 = FF5, RS3 = FF6). The music is exceptional, definitely on par with the Final Fantasy games. Romancing SaGa 3's soundtrack is probably my favourite game soundtrack not counting Falcom's games. Of the three games, I've only played Romancing SaGa 3, but it was great and I'd definitely recommend it if you like JRPGs."

JRPG,3c0qtt,bendmorris,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed SaGa Frontier, less so SF2. Each character has its own primary objective in the storyline, so there was a good amount of replayability. I don't remember that much else about the game, but it was good enough that I now feel compelled to play it again... So there's that I suppose!"
JRPG,3c0qtt,sum-dude,4,Sat Jul 4 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"Romancing SaGa was also remade for PS2. I played that for a while, then tried the in-progress fan translation. Pros of the remake:   They fixed some missing quests and added some new ones as well. SNES version is missing some things - you can't get all the fate stones for example. A few new systems such as classes, environment abilities, crafting. Really gives the game a ton of depth. They substituted the old HP/MP with the SaGa Frontier style HP/LP/BP system, which you may or may not prefer. You can revive downed characters in battle by healing them, but if they run out of LP they're permanently dead. Characters also regain a set amount of BP per turn which encourages you to actually use those abilities. Ability ""sparking"" and combos a la SaGa Frontier, plus significantly more combat abilities in general, makes for more depth in combat. Weapon levels. In the SNES version weapon levels are per individual weapon (so no ""sword level"", just levels with individual swords) and actually reset if you unequip and then reequip the same weapon, discouraging you from ever changing equipment.   Cons:   Graphics don't appeal to everyone (I'm in this camp) Voice acting is hammed up and people take forever to say anything You have no control over the camera, which in a 3D game with touch encounters is extremely annoying. You're walking along and suddenly it rotates 90 degrees and you can't see where you're going. Also makes finding your way back to the start of an area very tough. #1 annoyance with the remake. Only 5 max party members instead of 6.   All in all, the SNES version is worth playing and is nice to carry around on a handheld emulation device, but if you enjoy it I'd suggest looking into the PS2 remake as well."

You should definitely add it to your list, it's one of the better jRPGs for the SNES.  I'm definitely excited about playing the first RS title now, although I'm going to try to keep my expectations low."
JRPG,3c0qtt,Kenpokid4,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:23:51 2015 UTC,"I played this some months ago when the translation was still in beta. I really can't say anything good about it, though. The translation is AMAZING and is very well done... but the game itself is filled to the brim with problems and I don't even know where to begin.  · The biggest problem imo is that the walking speed is too slow (I think you can't even run) and the maps are not exactly small. Some are pretty expansive.  · Instead of random encounters, you can see the monsters in the field and fight them. This is generally great since random encounters tend to be annoying. But in this game there are DOZENS of enemies in the same room and it's practically the same thing. I've been through caves and plains where I had to fight 20 battles in a row because of the huge amount of monsters in the same SMALL space I couldn't get away from. It gets old really, REALLY fast.  · The battles are very slow. They're not really engaging since the graphics are definitely not Square's best, the attack animations are rather meh and the general pace of the battle is slow. Japanese wikis recommend having less party members but I found that that didn't really help the issue. I'm not one to speed-up battles when emulating, but I had to do it unfortunately.  · Since the game is based on quests instead of one main linear storyline, you'll have to go around town looking for NPCs with quests. But... considering this is one of the very first quest-driven RPGs and considering it was released on SNES, the quest system is pretty bare bones. No notebook to keep a record of your progress, no markers, no real help from the game either. Most of the quests objectives are rather lame and they're not that varied. Sure, some quests do open up special dungeons, but there's just not enough variety or enjoyment from them.  · Weapon levels. They are tied TO EACH PARTICULAR WEAPON, not to the type of weapon. And if you unequip a weapon IT LOSES ALL OF ITS LEVELS, meaning, all of your skills. Super annoying  · Party members don't interact with each other and are largely disposable. There's no real bonding with the protagonist and the player either.  · It's just too cryptic and you'll most likely have to use a guide for absolutely everything, even understanding the battle system.  Really, the only positive thing is the music composed by gaming god Kenji Ito. I really wanted to love this game, but it's just so primitive. They wanted to do so much with it and they kind of did, it must have been a blast to play at the time, but this game has been overdone by many other jrpgs and even its remake. I can't really recommend it, not even to fans of SaGa. I wanted to love this game, too, but I just couldn't, it's terribly flawed :'("

JRPG,3bxgxi,Toadinator2000,11,Fri Jul 3 01:23:40 2015 UTC,100% with you on tales. Really most of that series is just tired tropes rearranged with revealing outfits but God damn if that battle system isn't one of my favorites.   Like seriously could we have one game that doesn't make a single reference to breasts?   EDIT: How do I get downvoted on a sub where downvotes are disabled. That seems like a lot of work that might have been better served by a comment.
JRPG,3bxgxi,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,8,Fri Jul 3 04:06:53 2015 UTC,"I actually really loved the story of Tales of Symphonia.  Yeah, it used the tropes as well, but I thought it created an interesting world with likable characters and believable villains.  I also liked Abyss' plot.  I wasn't too keen on how badly they abused cliches in the beginning and the weak script, but the core story I found to be very interesting."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Toadinator2000,5,Fri Jul 3 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"You're right, I'm mostly just ragging on my favorite series and probably being a bit harsh about it.   Some of them use the tropes well others don't. And I have to say that I really liked the first 2 acts of Vesperia's plot. The game kinda derails at the end, but it was nice to have such a dark protagonist.  Generally from the JRPGs I've played the stories aren't as good as some of their western counterparts. I just wish I could have tales gameplay and a rich/interesting story at the same time."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,4,Fri Jul 3 13:43:44 2015 UTC,Graces doesn't have a good story but most Tales games are good. The plots are interesting and usually decently-paced and the characters are more complex and developed than in most games.
JRPG,3bxgxi,Timewinders,6,Fri Jul 3 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on your reference point. I mean the stories are certainly better and less trope-y than say atelier or even some of the recent star ocean games, but probably not on par with some of the older final fantasy games or a lot of the stuff coming out of the west.  Frequently I just find the motivation of the characters is poorly thought out, especially the villains. Keeping in mind I just finished my replay of vesperia so that might be coloring my opinion"
JRPG,3bxgxi,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,2,Fri Jul 3 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"Every story uses tropes and cliches and are usually predictable, it doesn't matter whether it's a western game like Dragon Age or a JRPG or even movies, books, and TV. All that matters is the execution, and Tales does that well IMO, better than most JRPGs. I think the character motivations are usually pretty good, at least in Abyss and Xillia. The only one whose motivations didn't really make sense to me was Elize in Xillia. I haven't played Vesperia yet so I don't know how it compares."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Timewinders,2,Fri Jul 3 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"Its been a while since I've played Abyss, but I mostly remember there being very little subtlety to the story. It was very clearly about nature vs nurture and they beat that into the ground. They did a pretty good job developing Luke's character from what I remember because I know that I hated him at the beginning.   I'll agree with you that they are better than most JRPGs in their execution, but you can't look at them in a vacuum. I think their stories fall short when compared to many western titles. It's like comparing Naruto to Game of thrones, the story is just not as complex and convincing.  Aside: this isn't a bash on anime, while I have similar issues with many of them there are some like Cowboy Bebop that are actually very well written."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,7,Fri Jul 3 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think lack of subtlety is that bad of a thing, and definitely not a criteria of good storytelling. Are Western games any better? Mass Effect is not subtle about its themes of cooperation. The Walking Dead isn't subtle about its themes of how each person has their own values and people can be divided even when they need to work together the most. Even classic literature like The Scarlet Letter or Frankenstein don't try to be subtle about themes. The whole point of a story is for people to get something out of it, so if it's too subtle that can (though not necessarily) be a problem. When writing, you're more likely to do a bad job by being too subtle than by not being subtle enough. Every writing professor I've had has told me to make the themes of the story and the character development clear.  I think you're also overestimating how good Western games are. I've played a decent number, but most of them are seriously lacking in character development. Even some of the ones that do, like Dragon Age, fail to integrate the character development with the main plot. Every character in a Tales game is relevant to the plot and has a reason to exist, which is much better IMO. Many games, like Dragon Age and KOTOR, also have pacing problems because they are not linear and the main plot is put on hold while you do side areas because the focus is on roleplaying and worldbuilding, not storytelling. Tales doesn't have this problem. Others, like Pillars of Eternity, are just poorly written stylistically. And many games, like Shadow of Mordor, have really, really generic, cookiecutter characters whose every line of dialogue is predictable just like the bad JRPGs.  I'm not saying there aren't any good Western games, but there are good and bad ones just like JRPGs, and the best games of the Tales series are better than any Western game I've played in terms of storytelling."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Timewinders,4,Fri Jul 3 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"First off, that was very well put. I appreciate being able to have a real discussion about this.  I'll definitely agree with you that some stories suffer for being too subtle, but not everything has to be 1984 or the examples you gave. And I'm not saying all tales games are as in your face as ""courage is that magic that turns dreams into reality"" (ToS2), but there is a happy medium to be reached and the tales games don't really do that for me. I think its in part because before every major boss battle the writers feel the need to restate the characters motivations in simple terms. I don't know that the stories have the appropriate depth for a ~40 hour game.  I think its difficult to compare a linear game like tales to a lot of non-linear western rpgs. The methods of story telling are different and both versions have their short comings. I'm also not a huge fan of non-linear games largely because of the weaker story telling; however, when it comes to world building (which is important to telling a good story) I think non-linear RPGs do a better job and rely less on information dumps and plot devices. I've always though element zero in mass effect was a really elegant way to explain their bullets and the FTL travel and a lot of their other technology to make the world make sense.  Regardless, when you compare tales to more linear games like Bioshock:infinite, last of us, or even things like borderlands 2 or a few of the gears of war games, I think tales lacks the nuance and complexity these stories provide in a shorter play time. I'm not sure what the target demographic of the tales games is, but its possible I'm too old for it and I'm looking for depth where I have no business looking.  I definitely wouldn't argue that western games as a whole are better at story telling than Japanese ones, but I haven't come across many that tell good, mature stories with appropriate depth for the length of the game play.   Character development is a tricky issue because while Tales will sometimes get it right (Luke), it also gets it wrong pretty frequently or characters will be largely stagnant throughout a game (Malik). There are also characters who seem like they are just along for the ride and get bits of pieces of a back story but I would hardly call them essential (Leia). The best example of having a well fleshed out cast is probably Vesperia (Xbox version so I don't know about Flynn and Patty) and I haven't seen another game that didn't feel as though at least one character was shoe horned in since then. Unfortunately, the character development issues are only made worse by their poor and sexist handling of some of the female characters (Milla, Tear, Leia). But I think that is a larger issue with mainstream Japanese culture than an issue with just the Tales Of series."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,3,Fri Jul 3 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the target demographic for Tales is definitely younger, probably teenage males. I do think some of the Tales games, like Hearts, could do a little less with having every character explicitly state how they feel about every single plot event. I don't mind it too much since I still read YA novels and the like. It's just a matter of taste IMO.  Personally I think Tales does character development well, though I've avoided the games people say are worse like Grace and S2. I do agree that Leia was the weakest character in Xillia, but I'm usually okay with one weak character as long as the majority of the cast are good. While I do think Tales has some Japanese sexism though I don't see how it affected Milla's characterization, unless you're talking about her outfit. Maybe I'm just used to tuning that stuff out. I don't know how Tear was bad though.  As for telling a good story with a short length, the problem isn't the storytelling quality of JRPGs, it's that many gamers want longer games so JRPG devs cater to that. There are a few with good stories that avoid that like Nier, Soul Sacrifice, and the Drakengard series."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Timewinders,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't played any of those but I'll have to check them out. Hearts R is next on my list once I get a PS TV.   It's an interesting design challenge to make an engaging story that long without getting cerebral or confusing and JRPGs are probably some of the longest linear games out there. I'd like to see it get better, but I won't let it stop me from enjoying them games."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:07:44 2015 UTC,What do you mean that Pillars is poorly written? If anything the writing is the best part of that game.
JRPG,3bxgxi,jamvng,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"The dialogue is pretty good and the plot seemed interesting but the descriptions were often cliche, didn't create images properly, and often overwrought (even for a medieval fantasy). Compared to the quality of description writing you'd find in a good book it was pretty lacking and really stood out to me compared to the dialogue. It wasn't so bad that the average player would consciously notice or care, but it bothered me enough that I couldn't keep playing the game. I'm sure that most other games would have problems if the writers attempted to write description since they're not experienced in it, but most games don't attempt it and so avoid that problem."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Timewinders,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"I see, I feel most critics actually liked the prose. It's a classic isometric cRPG where having descriptive prose is normal. I personally have been liking the writing in that game. It's a unique genre in that most games show these descriptions via graphics/animations nowadays, but there's a certain level of detail/imagination that happens when you just describe the scene via good writing and let the player imagine it."

JRPG,3bxgxi,gamesterx23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I had trouble thinking of a game to fit that bill.  Like I said, I didn't dislike SoM's gameplay, but it did feel really dated to me.  Leveling up weapon levels and magic in particular takes way too long and is very tedious.  Storywise, I agree that the dialogue is bland and uninteresting, but the lore of the world intrigued me and that was what kept me hooked on the game."

Still a lot of random encounters though. Unfortunately the psp version of EP was never translated so psx is the only option..."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Bluezrhap,2,Fri Jul 3 02:22:44 2015 UTC,"Which isn't as bad as it sounds since they took a lot of the stuff they changed gameplay wise from the PSX EP and ported it in to the PSP version of IS. The gameplay is very oldschool that's true, Random encounters are fairly common in P2, but the dungeons are fairly small, you can end normal battles immediately with a fusion spell or demon contact, you can skip battle animations, and if you get overleveled you can use the Estoma spell to eliminate random battles."

I loved the gameplay but thought it was too silly and Yuna being so much less serious of a character made her like a bad parody of herself.  Then on the replay, I see it as Yuna is taking things less seriously and going out of her way to keep things light and happy because she absolutely needs it to move on and recover from her grief. All those feelings are still inside her, but they need to be overcome because they were crippling her. I didn't understand that before, but I do now. And it felt very real when just the day before I was bawling my eyes out during her speech at the end of X.  And then I missed a missable item that was needed for the true ending and threw the controller down. Fuck that game."
JRPG,3bxgxi,HyakuShiki0812,2,Fri Jul 3 06:52:30 2015 UTC,Sorry that happened to you and I agree with what you said about Yuna but I still don't like her that way. Lol
JRPG,3bxgxi,Zaloon,6,Sun Jul 5 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"People tend to jump on me when I say this, but I really despised the combat portions of Persona 3 Portable. I feel like Tartarus was really badly designed and totally ruined the pace of the game, and at the same time it was so easy to complete after a certain point (basically when you have a lot of money) that I just felt like it dragged on and on. I hated having to go there, but I wanted to complete all the missing person quests. But I was so invested in the story that I just said ""fuck it"", grinned my teeth and just kept going.  And for something with bad story but good gameplay... I'm torn between FFX-2 and Legend of Legaia. The story on both of them were pretty rubbish, although they had some good twists here and there. But the combat systems made the game SO FUN to play that I just couldn't stop it."
JRPG,3bxgxi,videogameboss,11,Fri Jul 3 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"The combat of original Persona 3 was pretty bad too, with constant praying to RNJesus for your teammates to be smart and not cast Marin Karin for the millionth time on the boss.

JRPG,3bxgxi,Zaloon,4,Fri Jul 3 01:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was pretty lucky that I played the PSP port first. I learned about the whole random allies later, and I would have been pretty pissed if I couldn't control them at my will."

Inevitably you will prefer one skill over another.   This is not hard to grasp. Marin Karin is the most useless skill, but without total control they will still use skills which may be inadvisable."
JRPG,3bxgxi,sasquatchnh69,5,Sat Jul 4 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"How hard is it to set Mitsuru to attack aggressively?  Oh right, it isn't. And it fixes the issue. I've never had Marin Karin bullshit happen to me. I think it's happened maybe a few times, but that was always when I didn't set tactics.  As fun as it is, having a combat system where you control all actions as they happen isn't good for legitimately challenging gameplay. I love Press Turn, but that doesn't mean it isn't easy as fuck to abuse."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Bluezrhap,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:38:29 2015 UTC,I feel people over-exaggerate with the Marin Karin. Learn how the tactics command works and Mitsuru will not use it. It was surprisingly easy to manipulate the AI party members once you get the hang of it.
JRPG,3bxgxi,ekyle,2,Wed Jul 8 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I never had that issue when I used tactics. I also never really used Mitsuru outside of the first 20 hours, so it wasn't a problem. I generally thought the AI was good throughout the game even without me selecting tactics. I only used tactics on the main bosses and a select few random enemies ( Darn Jotuns in the last block )"

JRPG,3bxgxi,Whittaker,7,Sat Jul 4 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"I think Bravely Default. And I'm not talking about that twist, which I was actually OK with after a short period of feeling deflated.  It's just that it's so well written in terms of dialogue, and the combat is so amazing, and yet it's all hung over a story that mostly plays out in an unreconstructed ""go to this temple, now the next temple"" format like something from the 8 bit era. It has its moments, but it largely feels like not much more than an excuse to play the game.  Edit: I suppose I dislike how the story is told more than the story itself, on reflection."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Kenpokid4,5,Fri Jul 3 07:19:02 2015 UTC,"I think that, while the game's main overarching plot is boring, it's the characters that make it really interesting. The asterisk holders are all very interesting characters(Alternis Dim is my favorite but Victoria and Victor are also really good), and the main characters are interesting enough in their tropes to be good(Ringabel is an amnesiac, but it's done in an interesting way).  And the actual writing is top-notch! ""Brave Lee"" got a solid chuckle out of me the first time I read it. ""Ringabel"" is great. And once again, the asterisk holders all have interesting names and subplots. Especially if you do the sidequests in every chapter.  tl;dr the characters are good, even if the story isn't."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Kipst3r,2,Fri Jul 3 17:17:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. The localisation is just top notch and the much maligned later chapters have some wonderful character based skits.
JRPG,3bxgxi,Aujury,3,Fri Jul 3 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the game yet (it's one of my motivations to get a 3DS!), but from what I know of it, I kind of thought that the point of the game was that it harkens back to ye olde 8-bit era of RPG's? While modernizing certain aspects, of course."
JRPG,3bxgxi,Aujury,3,Fri Jul 3 12:22:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, it was more my understanding going in that it was a tribute to classic Final Fantasy, which I would consider to span FF1 - 6 at least, and maybe up to 9 before the switch to full 3D. I certainly didn't expect it to be less complex than even FF4. Perhaps I was expecting too much, but what I was really hoping for was a game in the PS1 FF style."
JRPG,3bxgxi,parazoa,7,Fri Jul 3 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"Bad story/Good gameplay for me was FFXIII-2, I didn't give a damn about the characters and their story but I loved the gameplay enough to get the platinum.

I've loved pretty much every other Tales game I've played, and the stories range from ""great"" to ""not bad"", but Symphonia just... I could not like it, haha. But the combat was so much fun that I still ended up beating it!  As for a good story and bad gameplay... Pretty much every one of Taro Yoko's games up to this point, haha. Nier had probably the best gameplay so far, but it's still pretty rough around the edges. But gosh darn it every other aspect of those games makes up for it."
JRPG,3bxgxi,reynaden,5,Fri Jul 3 12:27:11 2015 UTC,"Good gameplay, bad story: Star Ocean: The Last Hope. I probably wouldn't have finished that game if the battle system wasn't so much fun.  For the opposite, the only thing that comes to mind is Suikoden 3. I hate the changes they made to the battle system(s). All they accomplished was making the game more complicated and tedious than it needed to be."

The gameplay is mostly traditional turn-based RPG style, but it has an active guard system that adds a layer of debt to the battles.  The plot is utterly nonsensical unless you have already watched the anime. Or well, it's actually based on the full movie adaptation of the first arc. Which is a pretty bad thing because the movie has so much useless parts."
JRPG,3bxgxi,THE_BANANA_PALADIN,3,Fri Jul 3 11:43:58 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts 2 combat was like a God of War-RPG hybrid, and the higher difficulties were fun as hell. But once they started getting into 20+ villains, digital personality uploading whatever, characters that die and keep coming back, and friendship defeats evil speech for the fiftieth time, you just want everyone to shut up and start auto-skipping.

I think if it didn't have A) a roguish, pistol-wielding sky pirate and his (super animu) furry companion who comes from a forest planet, and b) a plucky blond orphan who grew up in a giant desert, then it would make people think of Star Wars a lot less."

JRPG,3bxgxi,frogsocks,4,Fri Jul 3 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"Additions, the item limit, the low variety of spells and items, bad economy (some equipment was unattainably expensive)."

JRPG,3bvcqg,HappierShibe,21,Thu Jul 2 20:15:11 2015 UTC,I can guarantee you that I WILL forget to pre-order. The game has to show that it's not a shit port first before I consider buying it.
JRPG,3bvcqg,Keksus_,9,Thu Jul 2 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"Namco has a somewhat sketchy track record with PC ports, unfortunately"
JRPG,3bvcqg,Mattnificent,2,Thu Jul 2 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"Eh what? Namco makes probably the best pc ports from all japanese companys on steam now (not that this is hard to achieve considering the ""quality"" of ports even from big companys like square or tecmo). I don't see why we shouln't preorder the bonuses are great the price is ok and with steam refund we now don't take a risk anymore."
JRPG,3bvcqg,pantsyman,5,Fri Jul 3 08:45:06 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. They're unreliable. Look at Dark Souls, Lords of the Fallen, Enslaved, and many more. All of these have pretty severe issues with either crashing, locked framerates, lack of options, lack of vsync, or just considerably glitchier than their console counterparts.   Yes, many of these games CAN be modded for better performance, but they really shouldn't have to be.  Namco of JAPAN, however, has ported so few games to PC that it's hard to tell at this point. We have no idea really."
JRPG,3bvcqg,Mattnificent,4,Fri Jul 3 16:07:10 2015 UTC,My plan is pre order week before release and if it sucks get refund. Since steam has that refund policy
JRPG,3bvcqg,AntaraX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with the feeling, but the execution is slippery. If they don't see the sales numbers, they're just going to assume there isn't a market and never try again. I'd rather give them money and bad ratings, so maybe they'll keep trying and do better next time. But, of course, I have some amount of disposable income, so that might be a factor."
JRPG,3bvcqg,mishugashu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:42:22 2015 UTC,You don't ned to preorder for that. Why not just wait until after release when the tests come in? Buy after that and they will see the sales numbers when the port is good. When the port is bad and they have sales numbers they won't care at all.
JRPG,3bvcqg,Keksus_,2,Fri Jul 3 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"In the event of a bad port mass refunding would probably send a stronger message.

JRPG,3bvcqg,SunshineCat,8,Thu Jul 2 18:13:21 2015 UTC,"I don't want to promote pre-order culture though. It's about more than one game, it is about the mindset that developers can get away with half assed ports and have people still buy them.  Even though I like the game, I don't want to give a company my money if they prove they don't deserve it."
JRPG,3bvcqg,Addaberry,5,Thu Jul 2 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"But you can easily try it for a couple of hours and refund it now, so there's not really anything to lose. Plus you get the DLC and Symphonia for preording. So if you plan to get these games within the next year, preordering seems like the most strategic thing to do. Refund it if it's unplayable, and you still won't be supporting preordering half-assed ports."
JRPG,3bvcqg,SunshineCat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this statement before Steam started offering refunds. Its really a win win to preorder now. It shows there is interest in the game or series, and the fact that the game can be refunded should put enough fear in them to not have it be completely garbage. Dont think for a second companies arent going to learn from this Batman fiasco."

I'd rather just run to the store and buy it for PS4 on release day than pay $60 for something that may or may not run properly, even if they throw in another game as a bonus."
JRPG,3bvcqg,SigmaValentine,5,Thu Jul 2 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"Not pre-ordering anything on PC no matter what. Have seen too many people get burned when they are over excited for a game, and it worries me that they have to add these ""tiered"" rewards. Ill just buy them both later of they are good."
JRPG,3bvcqg,Zaloon,5,Thu Jul 2 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"Friendly reminder to all PC gamers to NOT pre-order anything! This years we've had a lot of inexperienced companies doing ports of console games to PC, and a lot of them have had big problems in terms of stability, optimization and/or lack of options. This includes the release of FFXIII and FFXIII-2, which had big issues with resolution, big frame drops and optimization in general (I had a lot of random crashes and issues with textures). SE had to do a lot of back-pedaling to include the options that a lot of people were asking for, and it took them MONTHS just to be able to play with a resolution bigger than 720p.   Remember that most of these companies have never released a game for PC and it's expected for them to have some issues in porting their games to a new system. Some people think that just because games are developed in a PC they will work fine if you play them on one, but this is far from the truth.   Pre-Order is a really risky maneuver these days, not only in the JRPG genre but for PC games in general. There's been a good number of really bad ports that ruined the experience for all the early adopters, like AC: Unity and the recent Batman: Arkham Knight. If you want to pre-order because you're a fan, keep in mind that the game might have big issues at launch. Also, and people don't like to hear this, you're giving consent to companies to keep doing this really shady stuff that hurts PC gaming in general. I understand that most people in here are massive fans of JRPGs, but please try to keep calm and wait for early reviews to see if the game truly is worth of purchasing day one.  Sincerely, a PC gamer."
JRPG,3bvcqg,Stagione,13,Fri Jul 3 01:06:20 2015 UTC,"As a PC gamer who will never be able to play these games otherwise, I will take a bad port and subsequent patches over no ports at all. Even if it's so bad that it's unplayable, I can always play other games first and go back to it when it's fixed. No harm in having it if I'm planning to play it later anyway.  Downvote me"
JRPG,3bvcqg,Zaloon,5,Fri Jul 3 01:54:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to downvote you for having an opinion. But I do wish you could reconsider your stance, since pre-ordering has become a really shitty practice that screws over early adopters. With Steam Refunds things are in a better spot, but it's still a bad thing to support if you want quality games on PC. Because not all of them get fixed at all, and Japanese companies have a big record of just delivering a game and then ""clean their hands"". As far as I've seen, only SE has taken the approach of fixing stuff quickly (mostly because of the horrible mess that was FFXIV at launch), but even then it took them months and a lot of backslash from the community.   I'm sure you'd rather play a game in a good state than playing a shitty port that constantly crashes or runs like crap. And you don't have the warranty that the developers are going to fix any issue at all."
JRPG,3bvcqg,Stagione,2,Fri Jul 3 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't pre-ordered yet, and even then I've never really had a bad experience with early access and pre-ordering games on PC. With the exception of Evolve (and the problem was due to marketing, not the game itself), I've enjoyed every single game that I've pre-ordered or purchased for early access, although I usually tend to go for smaller and/or indie games (I pre-ordered Child of Light, which turned out to be one of my favourite games) rather than big blockbuster titles (Arkham Knight, CoD, Assassin's Creed) simply because they don't interest me as much. I guess the thing is that what people see as problems (poor optimization, frame rate drops, etc) are not problems for me, as very few games are so poorly done to the point that it is actually unplayable. I'm not talking minor inconveniences, but like not being able to load or get past the start menu.  I'm usually busy with school so I don't have a lot of time to spend on gaming. I don't have the need for instant gratification from a brand new game and I'm willing to put games on hold if it's not quite ready upon release. In that case, you can argue that I should wait until a polished version is available if I'm just going to put it on hold anyway, but I like to be the one to judge whether a game is playable or not since I'm the one playing it.  I've heard a lot about the Tales of series over the years and I've always wanted to try it, but I simply don't have the time or money to invest on a console. Having the chance to play one on a PC is like a godsend to me."
JRPG,3bvcqg,samuraigaiden,2,Fri Jul 3 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"I too feel like taking a chance with this one and I don't even expect it to work 100% on launch. Two games and DLC stuff plus supporting JRPGs on PC for this price is a reasonable value proposition.  PS: Child of Light isn't indie, it's made by Ubisoft."
JRPG,3bvcqg,zvenalot,2,Fri Jul 3 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"I have been a fan of the tales series forever, this is a glorious day for pcmr ! But, I won't be pre-ordering toz, if its good and meets the minimum  60fps, good controls for k/m, etc. Then I will buy day 1, but I won't risk this being a bad port. Pre-ordering games is dumb, I will buy both games when they come out and prove to be pcmr standard."
JRPG,3bvcqg,hchan1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"Says singleplayer under the description, so I'm assuming the multiplayer was taken out.  That sucks, playing through the entire game with a close friend is one of my fondest JRPG memories."

Finally, the pre-purchase bonus for Tales of Zestiria on STEAM will depend on the number of pre-orders! Once the pre-purchase reaches a certain milestone, bonus content will be made available for all users where the final step is Tales of Symphonia HD is given to all STEAM pre-purchasers!   That seems incredibly generous to boot."

JRPG,3bumvu,Azezin,10,Thu Jul 2 11:15:20 2015 UTC,"Though I agree, personally I'll be preordering simply by the fact that supporting this means we'll see more JRPGs and maybe more Tales in the future.  Also, steam refunds! No really, at this point, what reason do we have NOT to preorder if you really want it? if the port is crappy, you request a refund. If you refunded it and a patch comes the next day to fix everything, you can then purchase it again."

JRPG,3bumvu,Zuckerriegel,8,Thu Jul 2 12:56:04 2015 UTC,"Pre-orders are super important for JRPGs, because they are niche, and overproduction can destroy smaller developers  This is less of an issue for Tales, but I recommend preordering any smaller games that you have interest in"

JRPG,3bumvu,Azezin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:03:26 2015 UTC,I had to do that with Akiba's Trip.  Fucking awful.  I gave them the full two weeks and the game still didn't work so I refunded it.

JRPG,3bumvu,countblah2,2,Thu Jul 2 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, the idea of giving a company money for a product before they have that product to give me is totally ludicrous.  The fact that these days they now base whether or not they're even going to sell that product on whether or not people are willing to give them their money in advance is unbelievably sleazy.  Preorders are a publisher's wet dream, know what sales look like before you have a product to sell and know exactly how many copies to manufacture without worrying about creating worthless overstock.  Unfortunately everybody bought into this artificial scarcity hook, line, and sinker."
JRPG,3bumvu,Deksloc,3,Thu Jul 2 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"I am really confused by all of this.  Why the price differentials between PS3, PS4, and PC?  ($40 / $60 / $50)?  Why are PS4 users punished?  What are the differences between the versions?  Am I better off going with PS4 or PC, for example?  Why don't the Amazon or Gamestop or other vendors have any information about pre-order bonuses?  Why does it seem like I have to use a BAMCO site to register stuff?  Can anyone explain this?  It seems way more complicated than it needs to be.  Thanks."
JRPG,3bumvu,Pereb27,4,Thu Jul 2 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"The $40 for the PS3 is likely because it's a last-gen console and it isn't as nice looking as the other versions, and the game was already made for it besides the localization. The PS4's $60 price tag is in part due to distribution and printing of physical copies (although those are also both in the PS3's price), but also because it's a number that most gamers are used to paying for console titles. A very small part is the added cost, but most of it is literally because it's the status quo and because it's an even number."

JRPG,3bumvu,samuraigaiden,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get my hopes up on it being a decent port.  It was a gamecube game ported to PS3 then ported to PC, and it's there very first PC port.  I'd expect it to have the same issues that FFXIII did.  Locked resolution/framerate, no real video settings, slowdown issues and bugs, etc.  The real test is how they react to it and fix the issues."

JRPG,3bumvu,Victorys,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:33:23 2015 UTC,"Well I just preordered because I'm a sucker for ""free"" bonuses. Plus I want Bamco to know that there is definitely a market for JRPGs on the PC.  Plus with the steam refund policy, I figure if there's something seriously wrong, I can still get my money back."

JRPG,3bumvu,Hulkkis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"A preorder is a preorder.  There's no difference from preordering today or the last day of preorders.  The only thing you'd have to worry about is if a retailer runs out of expected stock and stops taking preorders, but considering this whole preorder buzz is an artificial scarcity marketing strategy at its best and has been for years, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  And FYI you don't get charged for the order until it actually ships if money is a concern.  If you preorder at a physical store they usually just ask for a $5 or $10 deposit then you pay the balance when you pick it up."
JRPG,3bumvu,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:23:11 2015 UTC,The pre-order bonuses for pc are kinda crap tho. I would rather have the bonus playable character and mystic artes then costumes. Free Symphonia is nice if the pre orders even get that far.
JRPG,3bumvu,Vinceisg0d,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"That's what's confusing.  They talk about retailer exclusive bonuses and like six sets of different preorder stuff, but don't specify what is what from who and where and why.  I'm guessing some of them come with more than one of the options.  I'm also guessing the others will eventually be paid DLC available to everyone."

However, I will not purchase them if they turn out to be a mess of a port. When a port turns out to be crap, aka Arkham Knight, PC gamers tend to get very pissed, regardless of the history of the series or company. That being said, if they turn out to be an amazing port, the word of mouth among PC gamers is very strong. If the port is done right, with the features PC gamers have come to expect, then sales will be much, much higher. Hell, if need be, delay the game and make a great port, look what that did for GTA 5."
JRPG,3bumvu,ZarianPrime,3,Thu Jul 2 08:55:54 2015 UTC,"Indeed, however supporting this means more JRPGs on steam in the future, plus you can get refunded if the port is crappy.  If you really want it, why not go for it? I've personally been waiting for the day I'd see Tales games on steam for a loooooong time. I'll be preordering just by the fact that it means we'll continue to see more RPGs from different companies in the future."

JRPG,3brve5,Dan_Tsukasa,3,Wed Jul 1 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"Well take some consideration. They are in poland so salaries and price of life are smaller, and the majority of cost in game development is salaries, and they already seem to have a great amount done. I'd also wager they have a grant from the polish government."
JRPG,3brve5,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"Govt here doesn't give grants, or, it seems, give a shit about game development.( from my understanding this is, I've not looked into it)  But the price if life here is low, costs are low, wages are also lower but most people own their own homes instead of renting. I'd say that's certainly enough money if they're paying the team even 2-3x average polish wage.  For example I work for a UK company ( I'm English but live in Poland) in 2 days I earn what a polish person earns in 2 weeks on minimum wage. I'm earning average uk monthly wages too."

JRPG,3brve5,barjed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think like most kickstarter projects, it would go a long way if they sat down and explicitly laid out where and how the money was going.  Otherwise it's just arbitrary goals and arbitrary amounts with no justification.  Why does 70k get them voice acting, but only 5k more magically materializes into a veritable fuckton of extra content?  Why do they need to break specifically 60k for vita and ps4 versions?  Does that actually cost $10,000 or is it just a made up number?  Investment vehicles give investors and potential investors a prospectus for a reason, most people aren't willing to blindly throw money at something with absolutely no insight."
JRPG,3brve5,ffxivthrowaway03,3,Wed Jul 1 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"Because voice acting is 100% outsourced content done by professional VA in the States - this is expensive. Like I said in my other post, most of the team actually works for free, which makes the gameplay content much, MUCH cheaper to produce.  The same can be said about the console versions. Because we are not paying for programmers, the costs are mainly legal, certs, Unity console licenses, etc.   Obviously, like with any stretch goal in any campaign, every level is not exactly the money needed but the extra padding makes for a safer development process and, in the end, makes the game better."

JRPG,3brve5,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that.  I'm not saying they don't need that money for those particular things, I just think more people would be comfortable donating to ""get to that level"" if they can see exactly why it costs X for Y.  I mean, does it really cost $10,000 for the appropriate PSVita/PS4 licensing and legal crapola?  I'm not a console dev, I have no idea but considering some of the absolute shite that gets released in the PSN Indie library I can safely guess they probably didn't front Sony 10 large just for the privilege of listing their game for sale..  A quick list of ""1k for this, 2k for that, $500 allotted for caffeine because we're living breathing people and not robots, etc"" goes a long way to get people comfortable handing hard cash over for a promise."
JRPG,3brve5,ferith-,2,Wed Jul 1 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"That game looks really sweet. I'd buy it. Like the combat map design, as well as char design. Don't have a PC that I'd play games on or any of the platforms though. Looks like these guys are putting together something sweet however, good luck!"
JRPG,3bsdc3,crabtreason,9,Wed Jul 1 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"The title is at odds with the post. Given the post and title together, it would seem you are under the assumption that non-random battles are still non-standard. However, given that that is patently false, the title is rather pointless. Random Battles haven't been the sole standard for JRPGs since at the latest 2000. As for JRPGs without battle systems, I suppose you could say that Visual Novels fill that role, though I doubt you mean that much without a battle system. If you are looking for non-violent battle systems, I can offer nothing. As for non-standardized innovations, I suppose that the ability of the Etrian Odessy medic to restore health at the end of the battle is something I'd like to see more games take on, as it would help alleviate battle fatigue in long dungeons if you get unlucky with encounters, while still being completely optional. The skill based counter system of the Mario and Luigi games is also something I think more games should implement, since it gives the player some agency during an enemy turn, and allows the player to circumvent the ""alright, I've got these awesome buffs about to go down, aaaaand my mage is dead because every enemy targeted her specifically."" As for what shouldn't change, some semblance of turn based combat. I like my breathing room dammit."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Phoxxent,2,Wed Jul 1 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I consider the JRPG to be essentially Dragon Quest, and then layers have been added and additions have been layered on, but is essentially somehow a variable on that specific formula. But you're right, the last 15-20 years has already seen a marked shift from the dominance of the classic designs. I almost referenced that timeframe in the post but I couldn't decide on 15 or 20 years as a nice round number. Haha.  I'm curious about the weirder systems and even if a JRPG can exist without battles; VNs are interesting and there is a lot of variation there too, but they are a different breed in ways; deeper relationships take precedence.   I just sorta realized something semi-obvious though. We have JRPGs and WRPGs, and it doesn't matter where they were actually made. But Western made classic adventure games are like the equivalent of a JRPG without combat. Maybe with more puzzles too. Like, the reason they didn't make JRPGs is because they had a better storytelling outlet for themselves in these games, instead.  Also, that Etrian healing system is amusing, it's always just one of those game quirks, timing healing at the end of a battle.   Mario RPGs got it right with the timing, and I think Mother 3 actually let you time presses to the beat of the music, but I haven't played through it so I dunno."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Phoxxent,2,Wed Jul 1 21:08:52 2015 UTC,"Two things: one, the ""healing at the end of a battle"" isn't just moving healing to the end of battle as opposed to interspersing it, it's an ability that literally just heals you when you finish a battle, so think if Final Fantasy IV had an augment which cast a free cura (target: all) at the end of a battle, but it progressed normally otherwise.  second, mother 3 does have timed attacks, but I'm talking timed defense, which Mother 3 does not have as far as I can recall."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Zaloon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm not familiar with the Etrian system but that's how I understood it. I always would want to heal at the end of encounters and trying to time it this way without killing the enemy would become a hassle. Well, I was just playing FF Record Keeper and that problem is magnified. Very shallow game, but kinda neat. No intense defensive split second timing but you do you have to be fast sometimes, basically to heal before you die :P"
JRPG,3bsdc3,Jamaz,5,Wed Jul 1 21:53:37 2015 UTC,Bravely Default included the option to adjust the rate of random battles on the fly. I truly hope to see this option or something akin to it in other JRPGs as well.
JRPG,3bsdc3,Zaloon,2,Wed Jul 1 21:31:44 2015 UTC,"Ah yea, as I recall you could reduce it to zero? Could you just go anywhere like that?"
JRPG,3bsdc3,darkdrgon2136,2,Wed Jul 1 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, yes, at least in most instances."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Zaloon,6,Wed Jul 1 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of people dislike FFXIII, but there's one thing that I always thought it was pretty good and hoped that it could be given a chance in other games and see how it does.   I loved the fact that you automatically healed at the end of each battle. It means that you don't have to worry about managing your skills/spells as much and just go ham, trying to finish every battle as fast as possible instead of spamming Attack or low MP spells. This is pretty formulaic of the genre, and while I don't really dislike it (and most jrpg fans would lose their shit if it happened), the implications that it brings could add some interesting additions to a game.  FFXIII also paired this change with an increase of the overall difficulty of the random battles, which meant that you had to actually try (even if it was just a little bit more) to win and it rewarded you for ending battles as fast as possible. You actually had to have an strategy, even if it was rudimentary, to beat enemies in an efficient manner to get as much points and objects as possible. And I really love it when an JRPG at least tries to make random battles interesting besides having a ""fun"" battle system.   Most JRPGs, even to this day, only use random battles as a way to grind and/or to wear you down and force you to use resources to get through a place until you hit the next cutscene. And honestly, it get's really boring after you've played so many games. This is why I think Bravely Default's option to change the rate of the battles to whatever you wanted was so appreciated: people get really bored of them, mostly because sometimes you just want to keep watching how the plot develops, and the rest of time because random battles are for the most part really dull. I really think that a system that makes random battles harder but ups the rewards could be a fresh breath of air."
JRPG,3bsdc3,darkdrgon2136,3,Thu Jul 2 07:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think designers just hate auto-full-HP because it's hard to balance trash/regular encounters around it. There's also that lack of urgency for pushing through a dungeon if you're always in top form, but I think the best approach is something like the Tales' series cooking mechanics where you can auto-heal using special consumables without spending more than 1-2 seconds doing it."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Magus80,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:10:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that it'd be really hard to balance random battles, since you can't have every enemy be a threat or give too good of a drop. And in the end some mobs are just going to be ignored anyway because it's not optimal to kill them, or the player just want to progress with the story.   A system like Tales' or Chrono Cross might be a good middle ground, but I still think the battles itself have to be interesting or appealing instead of being dull for it to work. If not it seems like a convenient way to heal without accessing menus, but if battles are still a drag or not exciting you're just removing the ""survival"" aspect of going through a dungeon, which is worse since you're just taking away stuff without adding something else in return."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Soupkitten,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"But FF13 battles weren't hard, they just took too long. Once you hit mod game, you start hitting for about 10k per attack and have 4kish hp yourself. Random mobs have hundreds of thousands of hp, and hit you for low hundreds. That's not hard, it's just time consuming.  The only fights I've lost are eidolans from the doom counter, and the space pope. The rest have been ""press x until stagger, switch to a heal paradigm if someone's about to die."" And the rewards for winning quickly weren't even worth it, a small refill of you're TP bar (which is never used except for summons on bosses, which isn't really necessary) and some components for an unnecessary crafting system."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Maverick916,2,Mon Jul 6 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"I never said that the battles were perfect. The battle system had plenty of flaws, even though I enjoyed it far more than what I expected.   What I mean with that is that they took a different approach to random battles, one that has potential to be good if it's expanded upon."
JRPG,3bsdc3,Jamaz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"I was mainly responding to you saying the battle system was harder, when it's really not. It could have been a much better system, but the AI really holds things back. The simplest way to fix it, is just let me control everybody. Don't balance the combat around a 3 person party, then spend half the game forcing me to use 2. Don't make the positioning of characters important, then give me no control over it.  So yeah, it had potential. But the execution was piss poor"
JRPG,3bsdc3,humanracedisgrace,3,Mon Jul 6 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"Earthbound really nailed it for random encounters which was visible and if you were sufficiently overpowered, it'll instantly wipe that encounter on contact. I haven't seen any JRPGs applying this mechanic."
JRPG,3bsdc3,videogameboss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Good observation, I definitely agree on this point. It helps that Earthbound's battling and overall pace can feel pretty slow already, so it's a tangible reward after suffering in an area. Earthbound is almost perfect though, imo, if not a bit slow and light on dialogue at times."

JRPG,3bpoxn,MugiwaraLuffy,2,Thu Jul 2 01:44:14 2015 UTC,Now this is a sale!
JRPG,3bpoxn,xSora08,2,Wed Jul 1 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"I have already purchased nocturne and Catherine and I have played p4.  Is there any other game I should pick up.   Also, I can choose between p3p or p3 fes. I know it's extremely divided and I am relatively certain I want p3p as playing on the go is a bug plus for me. Is there any major reason I should go for p3 fes?"
JRPG,3bpoxn,HnNaldoR,9,Wed Jul 1 10:42:17 2015 UTC,"FES contains an expansion that takes place after the main game ends called ""The Answer"" which tries to wrap up the main story by answering some questions that weren't explained well in the main game.  It also includes a detailed world you can run around and explore similar to how it was done in Persona 4 (in P3P you have a map and you just click on areas of interest.) FES also has anime cutscenes whereas P3P has static images with text in the places where the cutscenes are. There are also some smaller but still noticeable differences as well such as the lower quality animations that are in P3P. It's not a huge difference though considering how old both games are, they are still aesthetically pleasing.  Personally I think FES is the better version. The gameplay improvements made in P3P are nice, but they aren't absolutely needed because it was easy to do things like assign roles to party members with the Tactics menu. Both games are great, if the portability of P3P is a huge factor in your decision then go with P3P, otherwise get FES.  If you like the series, then chances are you'll probably want to play both games at some point. If that is the case, then I would suggest playing the female main character route which is exclusive to P3P, then playing the male main character route in FES later."
JRPG,3bpoxn,ITSWAR,2,Wed Jul 1 17:09:08 2015 UTC,"Digital Devil Saga 1 and 2 (they're disc 1/2 effectively).  FES has a postgame chapter that helps the lead-in to P4 Arena, as far as the P3 cast, and the game is balanced around using Tactics (you couldn't directly control the party in FES or vanilla, you chose a Tactic [Support, Conserve SP, Knock Down, etc] for each party member).  It's worth playing P3P afterwards though, because there's some exclusive bonus bosses and the female route, completely changing the Social Links."

JRPG,3bpoxn,jorone,2,Wed Jul 1 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"You should try to grab Nocturne and both Digital Devil Saga games, but any game you pick up will probably be enjoyable.   Nocturne is dated in some aspects such as the encounter rate being pretty high, but the atmosphere is amazing and I haven't seen many games that can provide a similar feeling. The music is also great and I enjoyed the story as well.  It can be a challenging game at times, but it's worth it to understand all of the dank memes that are readily available on /r/Megaten! DDS games are great for similar reasons and from what I've seen, a lot of people who like Persona also love DDS."

JRPG,3bpoxn,alleycw,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:47:48 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to play Persona 4 Golden, but already gave up on buying a Vita or a PSTV. Would I be missing too much in case I just played P4? I never bought it hoping that one day P4G would be released on PSN for PS3 or PS4, but I guess that won't happen anytime soon..."
JRPG,3bpoxn,renatomunhozz,2,Wed Jul 1 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"No, you won't. I know it's an unpopular opinion that vanilla is a more enjoyable game than Golden, but either way Golden's additions don't add a whole lot that you'll miss. Besides, I imagine that you'll appreciate Golden a lot more if you play Vanilla first.  Play more SMT as well."
JRPG,3bpoxn,Bluezrhap,2,Wed Jul 1 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer! Actually I was proceeding to checkout on PSN at this very instant. Decided to play P4, and in case we get Golden ported to other platforms in the future, I'm gonna play that as well. As for other SMT games, I have SMT IV and P3:FES. Not the most newbie-friendly JRPG franchise though. I was utterly destroyed by SMT IV's beginning."
JRPG,3bpoxn,renatomunhozz,2,Wed Jul 1 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, SMT IV does that. Once you get used to the game's systems and make it past Naraku it gets much better."
JRPG,3bpoxn,Bluezrhap,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"I think Golden is a little more enjoyable for the fact that the additions don't really hinder the game at all. But yeah the additions aren't really important, most of them are cute/nice (save for Marie, imho) but are just silly things, vanilla P4 is still wonderful."
JRPG,3bpoxn,invaderark12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:37:09 2015 UTC,I don't know.  Going right to see Dojima without Marie in the opening scene felt straight up fantastic.  And I think all the easy-win stuff that they put in shuffle time was a bit excessive.

JRPG,3bpoxn,Kenpokid4,3,Wed Jul 1 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"Nocturne is in my own opinion the best story of any of the SMT series. It has similar elements but, you don't have to go to school or build relationships and you can fucking fight the devil himself. You literally can go through a pro level hard labyrinth and get a second ending. Or, rather I think there is three or four. Me and my brother had to take turns to keep our rage in check but, we did it. And it felt soooo good."

JRPG,3bpoxn,lestye,2,Wed Jul 1 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"They both have similar mechanics but, Nocturne is more darker than Persona 4 by a lot. Persona focuses a lot more on characters than mainline SMT which is about taking a path Law, Chaos, or Neutral and seeing what unfolds on each path. If you want fun and great characters pick Persona 4 if you want dark and edgy go Nocturne."

JRPG,3bq1cf,Zilveari,11,Wed Jul 1 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting series! I hope voters write a little about why they choose who they do. I personally would rank Tifa at the top of the character list for Final Fantasy VII. I really like her as a character because she is an admirable person and yet very human. She is caring and supportive to the point of being motherly, but is afraid to share her own emotions with others. She is friends with Aerith while simultaneously jealous of Aerith's quick rapport with Cloud (being as Aerith is a lot less shy than Tifa). She is also a ""complete"" character, in the sense that though she is dedicated to Cloud, she has her own emotional journey/character arc to make (subtle though it may be).  She would be followed closely by Cloud, because ""dorky unsure guy trying to be cool"" original flavor Cloud is best Cloud."

JRPG,3bq1cf,wallabingbing,3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to go with Aerith.  Prior to playing the game, I anticipated she would be your garden variety 'good girl' without too much else going on with her personality, but I was pleasantly surprised.  On top of being kind all-around, the writers didn't ignore the fact that the girl has spent her whole life living in the slums of Midgar.  She is street-smart and is able to think on her feet, which is certainly a welcome character trait for the kind of character she is, and good god was I surprised when she threatened to rip Don Cornero's stones off.  I also think that her sudden death at the end of Disc 1 strengthens her character even further.  The more I look back on FF7, the more surprised I am that they actually decided to kill off a character who was plot relevant, a major love interest, and a pretty girl to boot.  That is pretty rare from a JRPG even to this day.  Her death gave me, the player, another driving force for wanting to see the adventure through to the end because it was no longer about a bunch of guys on an adventure to stop Sephiroth from destroying the world.  After Aerith was killed, the game became very personal, even though I already knew about her death when I started playing the game."
JRPG,3bq1cf,Toadinator2000,3,Wed Jul 1 10:01:26 2015 UTC,You could do this for some franchises on their own and still have a massive and interesting list. The Tales of series comes to mind.

His descent into madness was shown on screen and his motives make sense despite everyone trying to decry him as a ""mama's boy"" to slander his character.

I really liked that Cloud, when the game setting was Shinra/Midgar.  After that he kinda had his ups and downs, but in the end he had a solid rivalry with Sephiroth."
JRPG,3bq1cf,Eep1337,0,Fri Jul 3 03:16:32 2015 UTC,"In pretty sure we can all agree OG Cloud is a great character, but the compilation and Kingdom Hearts didn't do him justice.

JRPG,3bnz36,enigmatican,2,Wed Jul 1 02:53:37 2015 UTC,"The wording is a bit fiddly, there is no Vita version of Summon Night 5. What you're getting in this physical copy is a UMD to use on PSP, as well as a PSN download code that can be played on PSP, PS Vita or PSTV. Some people like to collect physical releases but no longer play their PSPs, so this is a solid alternative."
JRPG,3bnz36,enigmatican,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:07:42 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot more sense.  I was confused as to why they wouldn't just make the physical copy the vita game.  There not being an actual vita game, just playing the psp version on the vita makes total sense."

And there is no barrier to entry in it being the fifth installment, it can be enjoyed without prior experience! :)"
JRPG,3bnz36,samatoa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"I really like the series, good to see that a mainline game is coming to west finally.  For who doesn't know about the series, its basically a SRPG like Fire Emblem and FFT, with some waifu and husbando material.   The differential in mechanics compared to other SRPGs is the summoning system. You summon monsters to ""attach"" to a character, making the character use spells related to that monster.  Got some spinoff games in west, like Swordcraft Story for GBA and Twin Age for DS, but they aren't SRPGs like the mainline ones."

JRPG,3bnuyq,Valdor-13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure if turning 2 of the most well known and successful videogame series of all time in HD collections counts as 'they love to do them', plus the Zone of Enders one people had been requesting forever.  Thats it 3 HD re-releases for a company with hundreds of games, not really a 'love to do them' thing.  Not to mention Konami themselves didn't make any of those, they only published them."

I think the problem was that there wasn't enough of a community for the internet based part of the game. The game was made to have online sections in which one Gamecube played the server and the other players connected via the internet to play on the server, and certain of the games scenarios required online play.  I think the game would be much better suited for the population of gamers today.  Not getting my hopes up for an official English release, but I know there's a community that has been off and on about starting a fan translation for the past 4 years or so..."

The game can be played offline in single-player mode or online in multiplayer mode over the internet or on a LAN. In online mode the player can assume the role of gamemaster and create an online game for up to thirty-five other players.  It is one of only four titles for the GameCube designed for online play. It is unique among these games in a number of ways. It is the only one where the GameCube itself acts as the server, rather than the player using a central server. It is also the only online GameCube game that isn't a Phantasy Star Online title, and the only one not to get a release outside of Japan.

God, imagining a HD judgment ring, looking under Alice's skirt and seeing an utterly fabulous Joachim would be heaven.

Apparently the Sailor Moon PSX games fetched a huge sum, and I hopped on some $9.99 'buy it now' for some weird Japanese game with ""Moon"" in the title that I was sure I'd be able to flip for a tidy sum.  The guy who shipped it to me was a bit off his rocker and sent me a weird box of stuff including Japanese snacks and a copy of Legend of Heroes 4 for PSX at no additional charge.

JRPG,3bkqxw,Toadinator2000,2,Tue Jun 30 08:44:56 2015 UTC,It's definitely obscure and interesting ; I'm willing to let it slide as an RPG due to its roots and story focus. The only way to play it now is via emulation.
JRPG,3bkqxw,SpatulaEvolved,2,Tue Jun 30 18:45:50 2015 UTC,It's not a traditional one at least.  I personally consider it to be a JRPG as it does contain a fair number of elements from them.  Particularly during battles.  Definitely debatable either way.
JRPG,3bkqxw,Toadinator2000,2,Tue Jun 30 13:10:06 2015 UTC,Still looking for a good price on the first Baten Kaitos.
JRPG,3bkqxw,SpatulaEvolved,2,Tue Jun 30 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"Keep your eyes open because it's definitely worth playing.  One of my favorite games of all times and definitely in my Top 10 JRPGs.  Out of curiosity, what are the average prices for it online?"
JRPG,3bkqxw,wickerman316,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:00:38 2015 UTC,I have played it before. I still own Origins. I have seen for around 35 in mediocre condition. A local place wanted almost 70.

Not entirely sure if they're 'obscure', but I've never met another person who has even heard of them. I'm clearly hanging with the wrong people.  OH! Shadow Madness! Radiata Stories? Uhhhh... The Sailor Moon RPG on Super Nintendo.   I know the Harry Potter RPGs are Western-developed, but they're JRPG-esque in design, so I'll drop those too.  Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits. The entire Arc the Lad series for that matter.   Pick the most obscure of that.  Sneaky edit: Aidyn Chronicles for N64. That's obscure as fuck. (I think)"

JRPG,3bkqxw,Cylinsier,9,Tue Jun 30 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"Haha, I must've skimmed over your comment! I mentioned that game in my reply. ""Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon: Another Story!""

Baten Kaitos isn't talked about enough but it still gets a lot of love when it's brought up.  As for balls to the wall, out there, who made this shit level obscure, that would probably go to Opoona. I pretty much never hear anyone talk about this game, and the few times I do it's because of its phenomenal soundtrack.   Edit. A couple more because I'm a loser and went through my collection more thoroughly. (ie. got out of my seat instead of glancing to my side...)  Magical Starsign gets a surprisingly small amount of attention for a Nintendo published RPG. Spectrobes Origins is a weirdly excellent sequel to the DS series people are a little more familiar with. Radiata Stories I only ever hear people talk about when they misspell Radiant Historia. Robotrek is just plain odd, I don't have much to say on that. Rogue Galaxy isn't terribly obscure but god damn it needs more love. Folklore I own but haven't played. But it's one the few JRPGs(?) that I have no idea what to expect when I start it."
JRPG,3bkqxw,MateriaMedica,4,Tue Jun 30 12:32:07 2015 UTC,"I will second that with Rogue Galaxy, first time I played it for some reason could not get into it I cannot even remember why. Then a few years later gave it another go and I loved it, I would love a sequel or even a remake of it with more sidequests and stuff.  Even though it isn't obscure I still think Breath of Fire Dragon Quarter should get more love. I feel a lot of people (like myself) first time they played it, it was a case of WTF!? This isn't the BoF I know and love! A time limit essentially to complete the game and using my dragon powers uses up my timer!? Get this shit out my face. But after many years I seen a few people that had that opinion initially and then they gave it another go and loved it, so I done the same and I was the same, I loved it. I feel if anyone reads this who hated it for the reasons I mentioned, when they first played it and it has been years, should go back and give it a go you may change your mind"
JRPG,3bkqxw,windir8,2,Tue Jun 30 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, our verison of Rogue Galaxy was a partial remake. Before its release here, a lot of things were changed and a lot of new content was added in. Additionally, there were more side quests added in.  So the version released here was better than the original released in Japan. It eventually got back-ported to Japan later that year.  That aside, Rogue Galaxy is an excellent RPG, and one of the reasons I love Level-5 so much. The game was robust, intuitive, and all around a fun time."
JRPG,3bkqxw,Kenpokid4,3,Tue Jun 30 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"Baten Kaitos was pretty good, but I hated the item degeneration system.  I never finished it, however, after my power went out and I lost 1 or 2 hours of progress."
JRPG,3bkqxw,Squiggles5231,2,Tue Jun 30 04:01:13 2015 UTC,The second one changed it so that only Quest Magnus degenerates and your battle equipment stays as is forever.  Much less annoying.

Also, I just figured that I would throw in a good word for Jade Cocoon. It's not the greatest RPG that I have ever played, nor terribly obscure (Maybe just lost to time, I suppose.) but remains my favorite RPG to date due to it's strange pacing and isolated little universe that it was tucked so neatly within. I still haven't had a chance to play the sequel that was on the PS2, unfortunately."

I don't know anyone else that's played it, but it might only be known to other people because there was an anime on it. For some time it was on Netflix but I don't think it's there anymore.  Not a horrible game, but once you learned the trick for leveling up combat (putting attacks into flurry attacks rather than the strength attacks, I don't remember exactly), the game got pretty busted in your favor and you pretty much just turn 1 everything. I do eventually want to replay it though."

The Crimson Shroud as well, though I'm not sure if it counts as a JRPG since it was designed to resemble playing a tabletop RPG. Folklore is also somewhat obscure. The Drakengard series is still pretty obscure, though Nier has gotten a bit more attention.  Not obscure if you have a Vita, but I rarely see people here discussing Soul Sacrifice, which is a shame since it was strong in both story and gameplay."

The gameplay is good but the game is very story-heavy with a lot of reading so if the main appeal to you is gameplay than look at other SRPGs like Devil Survivor, Disgaea, and Fire Emblem. The story is pretty good but nothing amazing. The game is very long at around 90 hours and the story's pace is pretty slow since the dialogue isn't concise enough so I have a hard time recommending it. If you like the historical references to the Punic Wars and the Roman Empire then you might enjoy it. The game also has a really slow start; the first chapter is around 5-7 hours and has very few battles and little happening in the plot."

Then there's Azure Dreams, which isn't as obscure as Bloody Bride, but I don't see that many mentions for it.

JRPG,3bkqxw,casper223,2,Tue Jun 30 12:58:15 2015 UTC,"There was a similar topic on this a little bit ago, and I posted about a game. I'll simply copy my post:  At first I didn't think I knew any that were truly lesser-known, but there is one game that I tried on a whim and fell in love with. It's a PS1 title called Battle Hunter.  I rented this one weekend and was blown away by how fun it is. There is one factor that helped that, though: Multiplayer. I happened to have 2 friends over when I got this. Don't get me wrong, it's fun on single player, but it's a blast with some friends.  It's a non-traditional RPG involving dice and cards. You build your character, a relic hunter. There are a few stats you can manipulate to your liking.  The basics of gameplay are this: 4 hunters are dropped into a tile based dungeon. Their objective is to grab the relic, which is spawned somewhere in the dungeon, and then make it to the exit, which is spawned away from the relic. The obstacles for a hunter are the 3 other hunters, and some randomly generated monsters for the dungeon.  Each move starts with a dice roll to see how far you can travel, and then you can augment your turn with your hand of cards. You can play movement cards to move more tiles, or play a trap card and lay a trap for somebody else. This way you can seal off certain routes, or get to where you want to go quicker.  If you run into another hunter or a monster, combat is initiated. Combat is ""turn based"" though each round only lasts one turn. The attacker will of course be attacking, and the defender chooses his action: counter-attack, defend, run away, or surrender. Both the attacker and defender also can pick cards at this stage to augment either their attack or defense. Then, two dice are rolled for each hunter, 1 for base attack and 1 for base defence, and the numbers are then dealt out, and combat ends.  If a player is defeated or surrenders, he gives up an item and it warped to a random part of the dungeon with 50% max HP.  There are also chests spawned in the dungeons to help you get extra cards. You also get new cards every round from a deck of 100.  Hopefully I explained it well enough to see why this is so fun to play with friends. It's a good mix of action and strategy. Once the relic starts changing hands and getting closer to the exit it's tough to match the level of fun. You get money from collecting the relics, and I believe also from defeating monsters. Using that money you can level your character between dungeons.  While at college, a small game shop opened nearby. I always loved their used games and DVD deals, so I'd often go to pick out fun stuff. One time I thought to look in the PS1 section and to my surprise, I found this game again. Sadly, I haven't played it multiplayer since buying it, but if you have a group you game with, this is an awesome addition."
JRPG,3bkqxw,Astolph,2,Thu Jul 2 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"For completely obscure I would have to say the Tenchi Muyo! Game Hen on the SNES.  For more obscure than it should be I'm going to say the Phantasy Star series on the Megadrive. Massively overshadowed at the time by Final Fantasy and Dragon's Quest and the belief that the Megadrive was for playing Sonic and Jungle Strike and the SNES was for jrpgs.   Not only was it awesome it was also pretty groundbreaking. The manga style cutscenes were awesome, killing main characters was unheard of, combo attacks haven't been done since to my knowledge and, in 4, the graphics were gorgeous at the time.   It really deserved to be a mainstream series but fell short mainly due to being a Sega game. Shame it's just another mmo now."

JRPG,3bkqxw,BogMod,3,Tue Jun 30 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"Other RPG Maker games well worth consideration:   The Way. An episodic game broken up into six segments. It takes a bit for the story to get going and Part 6 is largely nonlinear, in the style of FFVI's World of Ruin, but it's a really well-crafted story with some really memorable characters. Jay's Journey. Since the default tilesets, music, etc. were so widely derided, one maker took on a bet that a good RPG could be made using only them. It's a super sarcastic game that pokes fun at a lot of JRPG tropes circa 2000. Off. French RPG heavily inspired by Earthbound for RPGMaker 2k3. The boss fights are grindy and some of the puzzles can get obnoxious because the images they rely upon aren't translated from the original French, but the setting, style, and story more than make up for these shortcomings."

The Book of Three- way older game, based on novel of the same name.  Plucked some heart strings. Very earnest. Last Scenario- By the same guy who did Exit Fate.  Made earlier, much more traditional.  Plot twists some later.  Well made.   Not So Free   Deadly Sin 2- Really neat battle system, okay story, pretty good music.  Pretty cool overall. (The same developer also made Skyborn, which, while favorably reviewed, I haven't played). Sacred Tears TRUE- Interesting battle system, neat art style.  Episodic gameplay.  Pretty fun overall.

JRPG,3bichc,thorgi_of_arfsgard,37,Mon Jun 29 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"I personally don't care what engine is used to make a game, what matters is the final product. With the current incarnation of RPG Maker you can actually modify most of the engine code in Ruby. Its very powerful and gives you a lot of control if you know what you are doing. The only reason RPG Maker games are so easy to point out is because people stick with the default assets. This makes your game look rather generic.  My experience with game development, no one gives a flying crap if you wrote your own custom engine from the ground up (except maybe other developers lol). Do whatever gets the job done and fits your requirements. At the same time, don't expect people to care about your game if its littered with default assets from the RTP. There are so many games out there it will likely get glossed over.  Personally I've used Unity, cocos2d and libgdx. I have dabbled in RPG Maker for fun but the biggest thing it lacks in my opinion is multi-platform building."
JRPG,3bichc,so3arbelnox,7,Mon Jun 29 13:55:41 2015 UTC,"I've had about the same experience as you with it. If I did use it, I wouldn't use any default assets. I'm not a great artist, but I'm trying to learn some pixel art and enjoy doing so.   I'm happy to hear about how open and modifiable the engine is. My only real experience with it was LISA, which I know used a modified battle engine allowing action inputs.   I agree the main culprit behind their bad reception is the RTP asset usage."

The problem is they're few and far between.  They've garnered this stigma because there's so much absolute amateur crap pumped out using RPG Maker that people are too jaded to sift through the crap for the handful of gems.  Very frequently you'll come across default assets (or worse, stolen assets from other games), default music and sfx, the default turn based combat system, no game balance, terrible writing, and design elements that clearly had little to no thought put into them.  You can do some amazing work with RPG Maker as an engine.  99.9% of people don't."

If you want flexibility, then XP and after allow for scripting, which gives you way more options.

I think my biggest problem with that series is that it's so needlessly obtuse and likes to obfuscate simple tasks like leveling up behind a wall of frustrating extra steps.  Like, there is no problem with making leveling up in an RPG an abstract concept; when you have enough points, just bring up a screen that allows you to allocate stats.  You don't need to go talk to a doll that only even seems like an object you can interact with after you have collected a point of Insight in order to level up your stats.  Beyond that, I don't feel like an RPG should have to hold the player's hand, but what it definitely 100% should not do is make everything as purposefully vague as the Souls series.  I guess I can't judge it too much because I've only played maybe an hour of each (that's more than enough to know that I don't like the series, however) -- maybe the story fleshes out later.  But I'll definitely take a traditional narrative over the ""wander, wander, boss, wander, boss, die, die, die"" approach of that series."
JRPG,3bichc,LVX156,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"There is nothing vague about the Souls series, unless you just run around without thinking, and ignore all the clues in item descriptions and the environment.

JRPG,3bichc,MartMillz,2,Tue Jun 30 16:42:56 2015 UTC,It's really vague! You can just completely miss half the NPCs and you barely understand the significance of any of their quest lines anyway.

RPG Maker, Java, hacked together by stringing Game Boy Cartridges together with a pine needle, whatever. A game is good when a game is good, no two ways about it.  With that in mind, RPG maker is looked down on as a game source because, quite frankly, it usually indicates a low level of effort put in by the developer. And they're usually right- Most RPG Maker games are quite frankly cookie cutter games that don't really amount to anything unique, interesting, or really worth while.  But this also goes for all creation engines of the nature. If you use a cookie cutter developing system what you're going to get is a cookie cutter final product."
JRPG,3bichc,aett,4,Mon Jun 29 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"First off: I believe that Barkley, Shut up and Jam: Gaiden: Chapter 1 of of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa was made in GameMaker. (They started it in RPGMaker, and released a demo that included the first dungeon, then recreated it. That allowed them to have a more interesting Paper Mario-style battle system.) Visually, the game is obviously a mishmash of sprites and other resources, but the game is well-written and actually fun to play.  As far as actual RPGMaker games go, I have to admit that I don't have a lot of experience with anything made in the last several years, after playing countless terrible games created in RPGM2k and 2k3. The one major exception from back then was A Blurred Line. Much like Barkley, the visuals aren't great and are clearly patchwork, but the alternate paths (and characters), unique battle system, and interesting story helped it stand out.  Once in a while I check out an RPGM game that comes highly recommended, and I notice that they tend to need an editor BADLY. Each conversation goes on for far too long and they would benefit from being much snappier. Additionally, the games I've played tended to be either far too serious (and therefore dull, especially with all the unnecessary dialogue) or too goofy - which can be good, but the humor is mostly embarrassingly bad."

If you don't mind the game not taking itself seriously at all (but in a good way, I think), I recommend it. Lilly and Sasha has a little more puzzle stuff in it than I would like, but overall this dev's games are my favorite RPGMaker games so far.

JRPG,3bichc,Watermelon420,3,Mon Jun 29 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I've bought a few RPGMaker games on Steam thinking, man, this looks really good. And I was disappointed every time.

JRPG,3bichc,kuroiryu146,2,Tue Jun 30 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not either of those, but I enjoy RPG Maker games just fine when the developer actually tries to make it good. I obviously understand why people who prioritize graphics more than I do don't like them, but games having the same grass just doesn't bother me if other things are done well.   I would prefer good graphics, but that often comes at the expense of exploration in this genre. At least there are still JRPGs coming out that let you walk into people's houses and take stuff, or traverse a world map. I'm personally really into different systems/features with clear goals that I can work on alongside the main game, such as crafting, finding treasure with Chocobos (FFIX), fishing (if there is a goal), and monster hunts like in FFXII or Rogue Galaxy, and RPG Maker games are just as capable of doing that as any other."
JRPG,3bichc,Phoxxent,4,Thu Jul 2 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"I've been programming a JRPG in GameMaker off and on for about a year now, after having started it in RPG Maker. I found it much easier to work with a GameMaker's blank slate than trying to dismantle RPG Maker's built in functions that I didn't want while adding functions that weren't normally supported. I found GML far easier to learn than Ruby also.  Personally, no matter how good a game's story is, I am inclined to look elsewhere if it was made in RPG Maker. The graphics and usually just too far gone."
JRPG,3bichc,cbsa82,2,Mon Jun 29 21:52:12 2015 UTC,I can see that. Usually I immediately turn elsewhere if I see a game uses the rtp. Mind showing your progress with your jrpg?

If you're willing to sort through all the crud, you can find some real gems, or even better, a developer who consistently crafts some great experiences.    That said, there is a bit of a glut in the market at the moment, so many games that I might have taken a chance on once, I pass by.  I only have so much free time nowadays, and I'd rather choose the newest from say, Falcom, over an untested amateur.  But then again, I've been pleasantly surprised before."

I played it around 12-13 years ago and I'm still waiting for the promised sequel that will probably never come. :( I'd say that was the best indie, one-man made game that I've ever played.

JRPG,3bichc,plausiblejosh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"I personally enjoy RPGMaker games quite a bit.  The good ones often have much better writing than commercial games.  I think the main problem with RPGMaker games is that they tend to have samey graphics, using the default tilesets and window boxes.  This is more of a problem for RPGMaker XP and above, where the higher resolution makes it harder to make custom tilesets and graphics.  RPGMaker 2k3 gets away with it since people can rip graphics from SNES games and the graphics give it a more retro feel.    Another problem plaguing RPGMaker games is that most of them remain unfinished.  Some of best games I have played will never be completed due to the author losing interest in the project."
JRPG,3bizc0,daftlance,23,Mon Jun 29 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear, to me anyway, that the dungeon gameplay will be completely revamped. They showed everything from what looked like a ""planning phase"" to running around in the dungeon in a stealth style. Movement is greatly increased (see teleporting down hallway/rolls) and there are more of a variety of obstacles and places to traverse (running around top chandelier, and the Sen's Fortress style swinging blades)"
JRPG,3bizc0,wavyhairedsamurai,5,Mon Jun 29 16:53:23 2015 UTC,Yeah Persona 3's dungeon design was not fantastic. The story kept me in it though and I appreciated the amount of freedom you had to choose what you did with your character throughout the day/night.
JRPG,3bizc0,wavyhairedsamurai,8,Mon Jun 29 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"Persona 4's dungeons are all different and more unique. They're more open and not restricted to small floors like P3 had. They generally have different themes to them too, like the retro game style dungeon or the club style dungeon.  The story of Persona 4 revolves more around the characters and coming to the dungeons as the story progresses. The game is 100% without a doubt worth playing. Don't ruin it for yourself by watching the cutscenes."
JRPG,3bizc0,wavyhairedsamurai,3,Mon Jun 29 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"If you have a vita I suggest getting P4 golden, more content."

JRPG,3bizc0,hexenringe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:56:52 2015 UTC,The problem with P4's dungeons is they feel less organic. Lots of hallways with side rooms instead of larger open areas.
JRPG,3bizc0,Kenpokid4,2,Mon Jun 29 23:18:59 2015 UTC,"Persona 4's dungeons are much more varied, and they all have their own theme, and most of them have a gimmick half way through the dungeon to mix it up. I only had to grind on one of the dungeons to beat a boss; but even if you do have to grind, P4 makes it much faster and entertaining with little details that stop it from becoming tedious, and by the end of the game I actually enjoyed just going through the last dungeon and grinding random battles"
JRPG,3bizc0,wallabingbing,2,Mon Jun 29 23:05:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, very nice! Grinding can be fun if the dungeons and battle system are entertaining.

JRPG,3bizc0,7mad,8,Tue Jun 30 07:17:11 2015 UTC,The dungeons looks amazing.     We saw platforming stealth and traps from the trailers and all of that is from one dungeon. There is also the fighting demons and ripping masks of shadows to get them (this is speculation.) And every character has a gun and a melee weapon as it seems (Like the SMT games and first 2 games)      I just KNOW Atlus and the P-studio well not disappoint. I can't think of a single bad games that studio made.
JRPG,3bizc0,Murkury,3,Mon Jun 29 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"The masks on the shadows were shaped like hearts, so I think you're on to something.  I find this detail pretty significant because of the taglines for one of the poster which reads ""Take Your Heart"".  Maybe this has something to do with how you obtain new Personas or something, idk.  That would explain why we seem to be fighting enemies which were traditionally Personas/Demons such as Pyro Jack and Norn."
JRPG,3bizc0,Lyriq,2,Mon Jun 29 22:59:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is where persona and smt start coming together, and the personas are like digital guard dogs protecting whatever you're trying to steal, which eventually become the demons of the main series."
JRPG,3bizc0,Vulkanon,7,Sat Jul 4 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'd argue it wouldn't have to do anything particularly new or different to fans other than new story and characters, more great music, etc, but from what we've seen so far you could surmise that the new dungeon gameplay and the plot point of being a thief and whatever revolves around that would be what sets it apart."
JRPG,3bizc0,AceAttorneyt,6,Mon Jun 29 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"We've already seen a few twists to the formula in the form of the dungeons, as others have stated...  ...but really Persona 5 doesn't HAVE to do anything new. The niche the game is intended for will buy the game regardless."
JRPG,3bizc0,hchan1,4,Mon Jun 29 17:25:53 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why it has to be new?  Plenty of people would buy it if it was just a rehash of P3/P4.  That's like saying P4 didn't deserve to exist because it was just a refinement of concepts from P3.
JRPG,3bizc0,ZerozakiIshiki,4,Mon Jun 29 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I'd like revamped is the social links.  I'd like to see the links advance every time you spend time with them, but branching storylines based on the choices you make in conversation. Instead of having an optimal outcoming you have to faq to get, all outcomes are the same mechanically, but show different sides of the characters; on a replay you could pick different choices and get a different story for that social link."
JRPG,3bizc0,irmoony,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"That's a cool idea. We already sorta have something like that with the possible romantic SLinks in P4 (and Yosuke, where you could pick certain answers to get a slightly different scene later), so it'd just be taking it a step further."
JRPG,3bizc0,seynical,3,Mon Jun 29 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"On a surface level they already changed a lot. They borrowed back from SMT this time wherein everyone can equip guns and instead of Shadows, Demons(or Personas since we are on Persona) seem to be the adversaries now. And obviously they added some stealth mechanics and death traps in dungeons."

JRPG,3bizc0,mikahebat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"I want the social link system to impact gameplay more than just unlocking personas and exp boost. Something like special skills that uncover hidden rooms, or traverse through levels faster, etc.  Also, I hope those sneaking sequences are not just gimmicks, but are legit mechanics. Maybe make battles much harder or have special super strong mobs, like the FOEs in PQ, which require you to sneak pass them initially. Or maybe a Deus Ex style challenge mode where bonus exp is given. Since the theme is seemingly about theievery, I hope stealth plays a major role."

Dungeon Traveler 2 is newest thing that's going to come in line with this sort of thing.  While the First Person Dungeon Crawler is a successful genre in Japan and has been for years, in the US it died and has only recently had any type of resurgence. As localizing a game takes money, and the companies that do so don't have the spare cash to have misses, they usually chose the games that have something unique to them to stand them apart from the ""generic"" games (Even if we don't have those generic games to get bored by)."

JRPG,3bhy2k,Livlig,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I finished Final Fantasy IV (DS) after 50 hrs or so, and I'm looking for my next JRPG. I've got both Final Fantasy VII and Persona 3 Portable, ready to be played on my PSP. But which one?   I'm a bit afraid of the grind in P3P so I'm thinking about playing on Easy just to get the story. Regarding FFVII... I want to see what all the fuss is about, and it seems interesting enough."
JRPG,3bgsks,ifonefox,9,Mon Jun 29 02:24:22 2015 UTC,I hope for the love of God it doesn't include a time limit. Hated that in the previous games
JRPG,3bgsks,Metatron-X,3,Mon Jun 29 05:58:39 2015 UTC,"Me too, those were no fun. I think we're in the majority though, since Shallie has that whole life task system. Atelier seems like it wants to take the good from the time limit system and get rid of the limiting parts."
JRPG,3bgsks,squidwalk,3,Mon Jun 29 07:42:50 2015 UTC,Depends on how it's rigged. Escha & Logy's was barely worth mentioning. It fit in the context of the story. I don't think Sophie will have one.
JRPG,3bgsks,darthreuental,3,Mon Jun 29 09:47:51 2015 UTC,I have nothing against a time mechanic as long as it isn't restricting. I don't want to plan every step all the time.  I always wondered why the time to create items wasn't reduced with each alchemy level you gained.  Or why travel time didn't decrease with each adventurer level you gained.  Especially Totori was annoying in that regard. And don't get me started on the true ending requirements.....
JRPG,3bgsks,Metatron-X,2,Mon Jun 29 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"Totori is why the second Atelier game I played was Shallie. I hated the time limit because it made me feel like I was constantly wasting my time. Escha handled the time limit much much better. I didn't have too much trouble completing every assignment before the end of the term. There were a few close calls, but it wasn't nearly as unforgiving as Totori."

JRPG,3bgsks,enigmatican,3,Mon Jun 29 04:08:51 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that it hasn't been specifically mentioned by the devs that this isn't part of the dusk story arc...

JRPG,3bgsks,ethernetcord,4,Mon Jun 29 06:16:26 2015 UTC,Depends.  A well done day and night effect can make a place seem more alive.  Depends how much control you have over things.  Can you just sleep until night?  Do you have to wait?  Is there a time limit?

It's nice to see we'll be getting a different approach to learning alchemy rather than from another teacher.  It also looks like alchemy might involve a bit more experimentation than just following recipes too."
JRPG,3bgsks,Whittaker,2,Mon Jun 29 08:40:56 2015 UTC,"One thing I really hope doesn't stick from Shallie: the difficulty levels. It really took a lot of the fun out of tracking down rare ingredients and figuring out how to make ultimate equipment knowing that I could easily beat the bonus dungeon bosses without great equipment on Hardcore. The appeal of the bonus dungeons is that you get your ass handed to you if you haven't perfected the alchemy system. After wiping the floor with them, I didn't really care about increasing the difficulty level and doing the same thing over again.  I don't know about other Atelier fans here, but the post-game and NG+ pretty much make these games for me."
JRPG,3bgsks,rugglenaut,2,Thu Jul 2 13:26:26 2015 UTC,I bought Atelier Ayesha on my Vita because it was on sale and has some PSN credit but I have never played a Atelier game. Is this a good place to start?

JRPG,3bed2n,heart-station,28,Sun Jun 28 13:02:31 2015 UTC,"fact that a lot of major RPG's are now getting PC releases   People keep saying this, there are literally thousands of JRPGS and we got like 20-30 on steam (less if you're counting high quality JRPGS).  I'd liken JRPGS on steam to the slow movement of Visual Novels being translated for the west (which is also dramatically small and slow).  Note I'm not saying we don't get any PC releases, its just its not lots of Major ones now, its just a select few, its far from being every game released.  I'm a console gamer through and through, but I love that they're slowly (very slowly) porting stuff to PC, not so fond that its often lazy ports, but ports nonetheless, with each port it gets better."
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,4,Sun Jun 28 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"I know that Japanese media (manga/anime/LNs/VNs/etc) being more available than ever helps, but I think actual Japanese games doing well on steam is a much bigger statement for publishers to make the jump. Not to mention the doujin games that found success in this market.  Also, I feel that Steam is changing the image of PC gaming in Japan."
JRPG,3bed2n,xRichard,3,Sun Jun 28 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"Certainly, it sets a good precedent for the future and I hope it continues to improve. Just surprises me people talk about now as being great, when really now it kinda sucks compared to how its going to be in a year or even in a few months.  I imagine steams going to do even better in Japan when the more adult themed games are allowed on steam (which I don't see happening)."
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,-3,Sun Jun 28 17:52:33 2015 UTC,Look at the number of JRPG released in English and compare to the amount on PC.
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,5,Sun Jun 28 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"Even if you only counted ones released in the west you're still looking at hundreds.  From last Gen alone you've got Ni no Kuni, Lost Oddysey, Eternal Sonata, basically any Tales of game (excluding Zestiria which is coming to PC),  Disgaea 2 and 3, White Knight Chronicles,  Kingdom Hearts (exclusing the upcoming one), plus a few others, and thats just last gen, if we go back to PS1 the ratio for PC is actually tiny.  For PC we got maybe 4-5 upcoming games, outside of that we only have Valkyrie Chronicles, 5 or 6 Final Fantasy Ports, Hyper Dimension Neptunia (thats on Pc right?), Trails in the sky (which was a PC game before it was a PSP game anyway), Ys (was originally a PC game like Trails, Falcom loves PC's) and a few others, its under 30 I believe, with several being final fantasy games alone.  I'm not saying PC isn't getting them, but people say it asthough PC is getting LOADS of major JRPGS, PC gets a trickle sadly, I'm really hoping the dam breaks and it turns into a full on river in the future, but for now its still a very small number."
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,-9,Sun Jun 28 17:41:16 2015 UTC,You listed of a lot of games that aren't major JRPG's. I expect Tales to make the jump now that Bamco is testing the PC market.
JRPG,3bed2n,lestye,4,Sun Jun 28 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"If we're being super specific about what counts as MAJOR, then its basically only Final Fantasy and Tales, so far we've got no tales on PC (ones coming in a few months though), and 6 Final Fantasy games, 2 of which are just ports of their original PC ports from the 90's.  I also expect Tales to make the jump in future, depending on how Zestiria does."
JRPG,3bed2n,Vinceisg0d,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"Until we get a PC release like within 6 months to a year of a console release, we havent made it.   It's absolutely fantastic that more JRPG devs are seeing the PC market. imo theres a ton of people who grew up on consoles/JRPGs, and would love to see their favorite franchises expand to a unified system.   So its good news, but let's not kid ourselves, we're getting hand-me-downs from PS3s library 8 years later atm."

JRPG,3bed2n,Zenith_and_Quasar,5,Sun Jun 28 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"Not really, I have a PS4 and rather have my games sooner than later.  There's still plenty of upcoming JRPGs that haven't been confirmed to be ported to PC later.  I still consider consoles the best platform for JRPG and I have a mid-tier PC that I regularly game on.  This might change in near future tho since PC and consoles are starting to be homogenized."
JRPG,3bed2n,X-pert74,3,Sun Jun 28 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely okay with more Jrpgs being released on the pc.  My only wish is that they're all controller compatible, since I can't quite picture playing a jrpg with m+kb"

JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Sun Jun 28 18:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a controller would really fit for most games in the genre, although I actually played through the Windows 98 release of Final Fantasy VII years ago on just a keyboard, and had a good time with it, despite the somewhat clunky placement of buttons. Because of the nature of the game, it was still very playable, aside from during certain minigames or whatnot."

JRPG,3bed2n,hippityhops,8,Sun Jun 28 14:01:01 2015 UTC,"Can   The vast majority of people have their console hooked upto the TV, wheras the vast majority of PC users have their monitors on a desk, because working on something all day on a giant TV isn't actually all that easy. Unless you want wireless mouse, keyboards, graphic tablets and so on, to do it for PC for most of us requires moving our PC downstairs into the living room, and then also moving our desks too. Bit of a pain really."
JRPG,3bed2n,runnerofshadows,3,Sun Jun 28 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"If you have a laptop you can install Steam on it and just stream games from your desktop to your laptop over wifi, or if you have ethernet hooked up by your TV, you can just connect your laptop with that.  It's not a perfect solution but it's what I've been doing to go through my PC game collection on my TV for the last few months. In-home streaming isn't perfect but it works pretty decently most of the time."
JRPG,3bed2n,msixtwofive,5,Sun Jun 28 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I could do this, but then I have to own a laptop, which for what I do is mostly useless unfortunately (its not that I don't WANT a laptop, I just can't justify it).  People who have their giant TV's in their bedrooms can make this work with ease, those of us who work upstairs and TV downstairs, its just going to be a bit of a mess using ethernet cables, and be a bit slower wifi-wise."
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,4,Sun Jun 28 16:44:36 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could also buy a Steam Link for $50. It's cheaper than the price of a laptop but will still allow you to stream PC games to any TV in the house. Wiring everything up can be a pain sometimes though.   From my experience, Steam in-home streaming still works decently even with a slow wifi connection, since I used to be in a similar situation but all the tests I've done on a direct connection have been much better."
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,3,Sun Jun 28 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, now this I didn't know of!  This is interesting, not so much for playing games on my TV, but more so for looking at my art on the TV if thats also possible."
JRPG,3bed2n,mysticrudnin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"You're right about most users having the setup you described, however I have a friend with a PC hooked up to the TV as a monitor, a wireless keyboard and mouse and it's not as big of a hassle or uncomfortable to use as you make it sound.  Regardless though, real 'couch gaming' is easier achieved on a console than on a PC, so even though you can play PC games on a TV it's not quite the same if you're looking for that ""enjoyable"" feel described above."
JRPG,3bed2n,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think steam game streaming, the steam link, steam machines, and other streaming/consolized pc solutions may change this at least somewhat in the future.

JRPG,3bed2n,godlyhalo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:51:49 2015 UTC,valve's steam link will change all of this and make your point basically non-existent for the price of a little more than a chromecast.

JRPG,3bed2n,Daverost,4,Sun Jun 28 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"I honestly love the fact that more JRPG's are coming to PC. However, my only concern is that some games might not get the proper porting attention they need to run effectively on PC hardware. Just look at the whole Arkham Knight debacle when it just launched on PC a few days ago. Piss poor optimization equals very unhappy PC customers. FFXIII had similar poor optimization issues, but some were alleviated with mods. I think the biggest thing developers need to realize is that if a game is ported well, aka Valkyria Chronicles, then people will buy it. Combine that with a reasonable price for a game and that will please many people including myself.  As for things I would like to see in a JRPG on PC. Japanese Audio is a must if it exists, there's no reason why it shouldn't be included. Japanese text would be awesome as well. As for controllers, there is a difference between requiring a controller, and making it more preferable to use. Valkyria Chronicles had very good kb&m controls, I actually liked it more than using a controller.  TLDR: Dev's, don't be lazy, make a decent port with the features PC gamers want and we will buy it."

I still occasionally play console games too (I don't refuse to play games I'm interested in based on the platform they release for), but being able to get use out of my PC via a wider variety of genres is always a good thing to me. As an example, I just recently beat Trails in the Sky through Steam, and loved it. I would definitely be up for more and more JRPGs making their way to Steam or GOG or whatnot."

I do like emulating for SNES games, but I plug into my TV for that.   If I ever got a PC capable of running the likes of FFXIII smoothly and comfortably, I'd probably play JRPGs on it, but for now it'll only be emulators, I think, and even there I play on original hardware where possible. It's a personal hangup, but I don't like using what I consider a work tool during my leisure time.

The whole Original vs Dub thing is fine, I totally get that (though I do often feel part of the reason people think things sound better in Japanese is because they don't actually understand Japanese, so most of it goes over their head, and honestly thats perfectly fine), its just in the case of voice AND text, it just sounds like someones after the Japanese copy anyway."

One option is to edit the games files in their steam folder (there are plenty of undubs for FF13 laying about for example), replace the subtitle and voice, but its permanent, if someones after switching option (like bravely default allowed), I don't see that happening, the number of users who'll ever use Japanese text has to be like 1-2% of the JRPG demographic at most."

JRPG,3bcuwx,ButchyB,9,Sun Jun 28 00:37:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I'd call any of those titles a remaster. They're ports, sure, but a remaster implies a lot more than that. Usually there's a significant increase in resolution or content--The Last of Us went from 720p/30fps to 1080p/60fps and included DLC that added hours of additional play. Same with the Saints Row 4/Gat Out of Hell remaster, Tomb Raider 2013, etc.. Vesperia's DLC is just costumes, no content (as far as I can tell) and there's not much to gain from a higher resolution or framerate increase with Vesperia's art style.  If anything, I'd expect perhaps a PC port of Vesperia. More Japanese games are seeing PC ports nowadays. Tales of Zestiria is getting a PC port and English localization. Perhaps if it does well they'll start moving in that direction with their backlog as well."
JRPG,3bcuwx,therm0pyle,3,Sun Jun 28 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say Symphonia, Symphonia: Dawn of a new World, and Graces went from Standard Def to High Def, and included extra content that weren't in their vanilla games.  Hearts and Innocence I'd definitely say are remasters, from the jump from DS to Vita.  Tales of the Abyss is the only one I'd say is an actual Port  With Vesperia however, they could definitely optimize it to be 1080p/60fps and include the extra content from the japan-only PS3 version, that I'd definitely say would be a Remaster.  It's really just semantics though, what you consider a Port can be a Remaster to someone else and vice versa.  Also, I would absolutely love to see a PC port of Vesperia. I've been dying for a good PS3 emulator similar to dolphin so I could play the PS3 translation that came out a little while back. Vesperia running at 1440p/120hz, hnnnnnnng."
JRPG,3bcuwx,ugblug,2,Sun Jun 28 01:30:50 2015 UTC,Hearts and Innocence were not remasters. They were complete remakes.

JRPG,3bcuwx,ugblug,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"what you consider a Port can be a Remaster to someone else and vice versa.   I'd say thats more about people using bad terminology and not understanding the terminology in full.  Upscaling existing textures and re-releasing a game doesn't make it a remaster, it makes it a badly edited port, otherwise we'd consider psp ports to be remasters since they're often the same game just with downscaled textures.  FFX on PS3 was a remaster, they remade some stuff from scratch, changed the music, fixed a bug or 2 and improved some minor things along with making it widescreen. That takes a lot of time and effort.  Re-releasing Syphonia with nothing but existing content and upscaled versions of the original textures (not better, just upscaled, so basically 1% quality loss) isn't remastering, its just re-releasing with a tiny change.  Then something like Hearts and Innocence were remakes, using no assets from the original game.  Things working at 60fps instead of 30 doesn't mean much, since its largely the original hardware limiting the games engine to 30 fps, the new hardware lets it do what its supposed to do, unless its hardcoded in (and sometimes it is... badly).  Its not semantics or people being picky, its 2 vastly different things, with dramatically different amounts of time, effort and money going into them."
JRPG,3bcuwx,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:10:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's still semantics. I agree that there's vast different way to go about re-releasing a game, ports, remakes, remasters, etc.   But there's no set definition to what is a Remaster or a Port.   Look at any of the PS2 Collections on PS3,   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_remasters_for_PlayStation_consoles  most of those are just HD ports just like Tales of Symphonia Chronicles where the textures were upscaled and the output display went from 4:3 to 16:9, but those are considered Remasters.  For the case of Tales of Symphonia, they upscaled the textures a bit, and modified it to display in HD, so I would consider that a remaster. If they just re-released the game digitally with no modifications (ex. Persona 3/4 on Playstation Network for PS3), then I'd call it a port.  So going by the industry, re-releasing a game that's been upscaled and modified to run in HD can be considered a Remaster, or upscaling textures and increasing the framerate and including DLC on disc can also be considered a remaster (see: Last of Us, God of War III, Tomb Raider, etc.)  It would be great to see some consistency, but that's just not the case. So what it boils down to is semantics, you may deem Tales of Symphonia Chronicles as a port, but others may consider it a remaster. Bamco could have slapped a ""Remastered"" label on the cover and no one would have batted an eye because there no set definitions, rules, or regulations for these terms.  Your view on the terminology can differ from others and there's no set definitions for the terms, thus it makes it an argument of semantics."

JRPG,3bcuwx,Scatterben,3,Sun Jun 28 01:37:07 2015 UTC,Is there any explanation as to why we never got the PS3 version outside of Japan? Seems very strange if a translation existed. Hopefully they see an opportunity for a remaster that isn't tied to Xbox hardware in the next few years
JRPG,3bcuwx,HyakuShiki0812,2,Sun Jun 28 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"There was never anything 100 per cent confirmed, but IIRC a Namco worker once let slip that Microsoft had paid for the localization. With that said, a similar arrangement had existed with Tales of Symphonia and Nintendo but Namco eventually bought it and were able to release the HD Remaster on PS3 as a result, so never say never. Tales is only growing here, too, so I'd say it's got a fair shot at happening."
JRPG,3bcuwx,ffxivthrowaway03,3,Mon Jun 29 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  PS3/360 games that were already localized are not anywhere near targets for ""remastered"" versions or HD ports.  You put Tales of Vesperia in 720p/30 next to the same game in 1080p/60 and more people than not aren't going to be able to tell the difference.  It was already in HD, and the art style doesn't gain much of anything by going from 720p to 1080p other than very slight sharpness.  You're not really bringing anything to the table to make people want to buy it again."
JRPG,3bcuwx,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Mon Jun 29 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily for old fans, it could definitely garner to new audiences. Outside Japan, the game only released on the 360, so there's tons of gamers who never had the opportunity to play the game. As for people being able to tell the difference, there are a ton of current gen games that were upscaled versions of previous gen games (Tomb Raider, Last of Us, Saints Row 4, GTA5, God of War, Gears of War, etc.) and they acted as a way for old fans to re-experience the games, while also selling to a new audience and getting them interested in any potential sequels.   The same thing can happen with Vesperia. It is definitely touted as being the best in the series so the old fans would definitely pick up the game, and through word of mouth, garner interest in anyone who wasn't able to play it before. There's also the new Tales game releasing on PS4 (and probably many other sequels) so it's a good way to get some brand recognition by re-releasing the fan-favorite on the new generation of consoles.  There's also the cost aspect, they already have the base game, they just need to modify it to run better on stronger hardware, which is nowhere near as expensive as making another game (could even just outsource the port) and the game could have a second life of sales.  And with the library of current-gen games, there's very few JRPGs out right now, so a remake of a well-loved game in an under-saturated market would definitely get a lot of attention.   It doesn't have to be Console either, there are many JRPGs like Valkyria Chronicles, Final Fantasy XIII Trilogy, Hyperdimension Neptunia, etc. that are seeing a second life on the PC."

And look at the titles you just rattled off.  They're all very mainstream, AAA bestsellers.  Not a niche anime JRPG.  The sales and exposure of every one of those titles dwarfed Tales of Vesperia in every way.   It is definitely touted as being the best in the series   That's news to me.  It was good, but there's no ""definite"" consensus that it's the best in the series.   There's also the cost aspect, they already have the base game, they just need to modify it to run better on stronger hardware,   Yeah, they ""just"" need to modify it.  That's not exactly a weekends worth of work here, the PS3 and Xbox 360 were vastly different than x86 based architectures.  That's a big project and a lot of money for (according to vgchartz) a game that has sold only 720,000 units worldwide.  The original question was ""are we likely to see it,"" and as much as I'd like the PS3 version to finally get localized, the odds of a remaster of a niche jrpg and then that remaster being localized are somewhere between abysmal and never gonna happen."
JRPG,3bcuwx,blackwaltz9,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:36:17 2015 UTC,"You say that there's no point to remastering Vesperia, but the same case could be said for Symphonia or Abyss, but both of those saw remasters/ports on future consoles, why cant the same be said for Vesperia?  It's a niche JRPG, but even if it doesn't have as big of a following as The Last of Us or Tomb Raider, but that doesn't stop a niche game developer to port games to a future platform. The Hyperdimension Neptunia series sold worse than Vesperia, but those games saw rereleases on PC, PS4, and Vita, the same can be said for the Atelier series and their Vita ports, and Valkyria Chronicles rereleased on PC too.  And while I agree there's no general consensus that Vesperia is the best, it's definitely one of the most accessible and well-loved by fans of the series. When anyone asks where to start in the Tales series, a high amount of the comments say to start with Vesperia (if they own a 360).  As for modifying the game to run on current hardware, Bamco was able to port a PS2 game (that sold worse than Vesperia) to the 3DS, and a PS2 game to the PS3. While it's definitely not an easy task, it's not as hard and cheaper than making a new game. There's also Tales of Zestiria and Berseria which are cross platform between PS3 and PS4, so Bamco definitely does have experience now with their Tales engine and an x86 platform.   I'm also not saying that it's likely that we're likely going to see a current-gen remaster, I just dont agree with the counter-points you brought up."
JRPG,3bcuwx,ahotdumpsterfire,2,Mon Jun 29 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"in the past year or so, I tracked down and played every Tales game and I can say with some gusto that the series has become my favorite JRPG franchise by a large margin, and Vesperia is my favorite of them, so you are talking what I like to call a torturous mindset wondering if that PS3 version will ever be a thing.   I'm already starting to feel the same style of anxiety with the 3DS remake of Dragon Quest VIII. It's fearful symmetry as it's up there in my favorite RPGs of all time and has two new playable characters from a series that has a famous problem with NA localization. I worry that it'll never see the light of day here, alone with the holy grail of non-localized remakes, it's sibling Dragon Quest VII 3D ( I should take a second to recognize Mother 3/Earthbound 2 in this category).  I would be more than happy to be part of a grassroots movement to pester BanNam for the PS3 version of Vesperia and Tales of Innocence. does anyone know the best ways/means to needle them into acknowledging that we want these games?"

JRPG,3bcuwx,outlawauron,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"I mean the selling point for me 100% is the battle system, which is somewhat Ironic that it's my favorite series, as I am a jrpg purist and generally don't play any video games without a turn based, menu based combat system. It's just grown so spectacularly from Symphonia to Xillia that I feel like even though each game has made leaps and bounds in the combat system, I can go back to older games and not feel limited.  And I mean, I love the stories and characters. I won't deny that they are all anime stereotypes through and through, but the stories are so good, and the localization vis-a-vis the voice acting is so damn good in each game that if you don't automatically love the characters, they will absolutely grow on you.  The last part is (for the most part, looking at you, Abyss) the leveling up and stays systems from game to game are so fun and unique I never feel like I'm grinding ever. In fact, its flat out addicting in some systems (Graces and Hearts) and I feel like a kid again screaming at my mom that I'll come up for dinner in another level."

Depending on when you're looking for new artists, I'd love to be considered for environment stuff, though it looks like thats all already covered (will PM you my portfolio if you're interested).  The environment textures are great, not sure if its just me though, but in this demo the environment looks very similar to a unity asset store pack, note I'm not saying thats a bad thing, a good pack is a good pack honestly.  I think the movement animations in the field are a little slow, could possibly make them roughly 1.3x faster than they currently are and they'd look fine."
JRPG,3bczxw,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks Dan. We'd love to hear from you and you can send us your details anytime. I'll pass on the word on the run animation and we're quite aware there's alot more tweaks and smoothing out to be done on the animations in and out of combat for a more fluid experience. This will get more attention once we complete production on the main cast.  And you're totally correct: the environments in the prototypes are modded from premade assets as mentioned in the intro, and also why we're dubbing it a prototype over say, a pre-alpha. The quality is indeed very astounding but we'd like to be as original as possible which is where the Kickstarter is coming in as we look to start production on the Trial of Nightmare zones in the coming month."
JRPG,3bczxw,Sinxsoft,2,Sun Jun 28 17:21:15 2015 UTC,"Hey you replied, thanks.  I'll drop you a PM, right now I'm busy with Koe (another JRPG), and for the next few months its going to be my highest priority and I won't be able to do anything until after its finished.  Glad you're accepting feedback on things and editing as such.  Re: Environments, I though so, wasn't 100% sure, was afraid you might take that the wrong way. I fully understand wanting to be original. From what I've read about the game it sounds largely dungeon based, with fewer set pieces than the standard JRPG and also no towns, are you planning to have perhaps a town in future?   I know they take time to make (believe me... I'm making them now, I know!) so shying away from them isn't a bad thing, especially if the plot doesn't rely on them, keeps things very character focused which appears to be your aim."
JRPG,3bczxw,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:46:49 2015 UTC,"No worries, best of luck with Koe, glad to see you guys making some good progress lately.  We got a hub planned but not an actual town in the traditional JRPG sense. Still there's story sequences where the characters get to re-experience certain events, which will involve sections of towns and the likes. We'll be putting priority on those since at the end of the day, it's like you mentioned with the spotlight being on the character themselves and telling their stories."
JRPG,3bczxw,AKABoondock,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, nice to see you're following it.  Those sequences sound interesting, could just require 1 street in a town, or 1 building (ie an event in an inn), saves you making an entire town for no reason. Dropped you a PM by the way."

Are you saying every game should have it's support dropped after release?  Diablo III is getting a full new area for free.  Warframe is getting new content for free all the time.   Smash Bros just got three new characters made after the game's release.  Just because it's DLC, that doesn't make it inherently bad, nor does it mean they cut content before shipping."

JRPG,3b8asf,Captain_Kuhl,5,Sat Jun 27 02:02:08 2015 UTC,"I have never seen the need for DLC in a jrpg. To me its about the core story and the characters that make a part of it. Once that is over and done with, there is little i want to do more with the game. I normally make sure i wrap up all side quests etc before i finish it.  Free or not, I cant bring myself to play a game again because there is slightly more stuff to get. Give it all in one package on release. It still has great value, and the more unlockables there are, the more hours im gonna be putting in. And while you may have a point, most DLC is never well handled, or as good as the core game. People lived without DLC before, and we had fantastic games."

JRPG,3b8asf,PoesRaven,5,Sat Jun 27 17:36:04 2015 UTC,Have you ever played a Star Ocean game? that game had SO MUCH stuff to do and get I don't think I ever got done with it. THAT is what I love about the Star Ocean games in particular. Just tons and tons to do.
JRPG,3b8asf,yoshi314,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"No, actually, I think I've seen like one copy used around here, and I already had other plans for my spending cash.  I've been meaning to, but I'm not a huge fan of ordering online (my current mail man doesn't understand to knock on the door before leaving) and digital prices on consoles have sales as often as Mario and Pokémon games are discounted.   My point is that if there's a good game out there, why should all support cease after a game is released?  Yes, paid DLC can get out of hand, but lots of games get free content, and if you enjoy a game, why would you want it just to be ditched?  Side stories to flesh out characters and the world more, extra characters...there are a lot of ways games can be improved with DLC, but apparently people are so vehemently against it around here that they'll downvote someone's opinion into the negatives for saying otherwise."
JRPG,3b8asf,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Sat Jun 27 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"People overlook that DLC keeps things light fighting games, racing games, sports games and sometimes even action or story based games, ALIVE.  I pay $40 for 20 tracks and 20 cars in a racing game lets say, I finish it in a month, well spent, but what if I want new tracks, if the company release NEW tracks or new cars or new decals for me to show off to my friends online (people do that sort of thing I guess) then whats wrong with that? I've got some new multiplayer only tracks that single players don't get, and I paid for them, is that bad somehow?  Personally I'm not a DLC advocate, I think sometiems its done really well, othertimes its a clear cash grab move, people just freak out about it.  The same way people freak out about game patches saying they're not needed.  If many players claim that a certain game is a bit unbalanced then a patch can fix that, provided its optional. it can also fix load times etc. People forget that pre-patch we still got broken games, but we just said 'ah its a glitch' and moved on, things that were unfairly balanced were just thought of as 'its just how the game is', no, if a portion of your players are really unhappy and you can fix it without managing the other players experiences, you should."
JRPG,3b8asf,mysticrudnin,0,Sat Jun 27 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, at least with the Star Ocean games is that there is no need for DLC because seriously? All that you mentioned? Is already in the game at release. Till the End of Time, Second Story, and Last Hope, I STILL have things I haven't finished, bosses included. Some games may do well with extra content (BioShock, Assassin's Creed etc) but most RPGs don't really need it if they're made well. It's why  like them for the most part because they take years to create, offsetting the need for a DLC because they take that time to make sure they have it all. Not all are like this, but some. To answer your question about support, if a game took 6 years to be created, and they have extensively tested it for bugs, there should be no need to have that kind of support (DLCs) if everything was done well. We're seeing way too much game crashing with certain games nowadays and bug fixes because of the short production cycles. I think half the DLCs that are coming out anyway are directly related to short productions, and were originally meant to be in the game anyway."

JRPG,3b8asf,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:16:15 2015 UTC,"I think DLC exclusive maps for multiplayer works perfectly fine, it doesn't change the main game, everyone can get it.  Your example just doesn't work, a few games release a lot of extra story segments and stuff yes, but you still get the complete experience of the game you were SOLD, just perhaps not the things they started working on afterwards. If the game wasn't complete without them then companies would push back release dates to add that content as part of the disc."

In the case of ffxii-2 it was just outfits and 2 new weapons to help you through the first hour of the game.  It wasn't story or character development, the game wasn't more or less complete without them.  Even a story thing like the extra chapter from The Last Of Us didn't make it's main plot feel incomplete at all, it was an additional flashback that didn't change how you viewed a certain character at all, just have you a little backstory that didn't matter in terms of the games main plot ( it mattered but didn't require fleshing out).  I've never purchased a game that didn't feel complete as it was and I doubt I ever will.

Day 1 DLC I have no issue with as long as it's an early cosmetic or just a temporary boost that everyone will get (yes on early low-mid tier weapons, no on exclusive maps, skins, and weapons), but ""pre-order here for exclusive content!"" is bullshit.

JRPG,3b8nim,Darelius,2,Sat Jun 27 00:57:42 2015 UTC,How is OQ? I have heard almost nothing about this game since it came out.
JRPG,3b8nim,vazzaroth,3,Fri Jun 26 22:36:06 2015 UTC,"It's an okay game. If you're into the setting and like IF/Compile Heart games, then I would definitely recommend it for that price. Be aware however that the game is really repetitive. There are a lot of sidequests (killing and fetching) and they require you to backtrack a lot in the areas you have already explored. However, exploring is fun since each girl has a unique skill to open up new areas on the maps, so it has a nice sense of progression in that regard. The presentation overall is rather mediocre, don't expect any next-gen graphics (music is good, though).   Combat is where the game really shines. You have a lot of skills to experiment with and figuring out a way to build up huge combos is really fun. And the best thing is - and I cannot praise the game enough for this, since it's a feature I want in every JRPG - it has a skip button for every animation. So if you're a bit more experienced with combat, you just set up your combos at the beginning of each battle, and then hold the skip button, ending the battle after a few seconds only. Makes grinding and exploring much more tolerable.  And one last thing: Be sure to look up the requirements for the true ending if you want to go for that in your first playthrough. Achieving the true ending can be confusing (basically just do every side quest and raise affection with certain characters before a certain point in the game) and I read a lot about people screwing it up because they missed one lousy side quest."
JRPG,3b8nim,Falukoorv,2,Sat Jun 27 05:16:42 2015 UTC,its ok..... I would call it mediocre
JRPG,3b8nim,vox165,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:57:10 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering this too. I'll probably end up getting it because I'm into the concept.  What I've heard so far is that it's kind of a lot of what you'd expect from Idea Factory / Compile Heart. It doesn't necessarily seem to be anything special but if you want to play an idol RPG or just a JRPG on the PS4, this'll do that for you."
JRPG,3b8nim,Electrium,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"The theme draws me in. I like JRPGs, but after years of Final Fantasies and Chrono Trigger, and Mana games, and tons of others... I am pretty worn out on swords and sorcery as a setting.   Persona 4 was sort of a rebirth of my interest in JRPG almost purely for the setting and characters being something fresh, for once.   So, OQ looks like it might be along the same lines. Bright colors, J-pop apparently as some kind of battle mechanic... definitely not something I've seen before."
JRPG,3b8nim,vazzaroth,2,Sat Jun 27 00:48:27 2015 UTC,Do we know how well Omega Quintet sold? That is insanly cheap for a game that came out a month ago.
JRPG,3b8nim,Grifkilla51,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"So if I like Tales of Xillia and Xillia 2, will I like Tales of Graces F? New to the Tales series. Having only played those two, and a little bit of Vesperia and Symphonia."
JRPG,3b8nim,Voux,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a popular opinion AFAIK but I wasn't a huge fan of it. Dungeons seemed a little too straightforward, and I felt a little limited by the ""AC"" stat while trying to do combos (if you see YouTube videos, your combo length is based on how you manage this resource called AC that isn't in the other Tales games).  I'd recommend Abyss, Vesperia, Phantasia, and Symphonia first, but those aren't on sale obviously."
JRPG,3b8nim,Electrium,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:20:12 2015 UTC,Graces' story runs much heavier on the cheese scale and I enjoyed the battle system more than most other entries in the series though it does take some time to get used to it. It's not the best entry in the series but I thoroughly enjoyed it -- I had been slowly falling out of interest with the series before it came out and it had a stupid cheesy charm that reignited my love for the series.

I consider this game to be my co-favorite JRPG of all time, and since Persona 4 only got to the co-title with Golden, I fully expect the added content of this remake to take the top spot.  but that's if NA ever gets it (eyeballs the DQVII remake and cries relentlessly)"
JRPG,3b6zdi,ahotdumpsterfire,8,Fri Jun 26 14:45:02 2015 UTC,"I share the same sentiment, DQ8 is one of the best jrpgs I have played and I would love to have this remake but before that I would rather we get Terrys Wonderland and the DQ7 remake first.

On a side note, does anyone know if they ever released the dq games in taiwan/hk? They released the ps3 version of dq heroes with mandarin subs and I was wondering if they did anything for the other games. I tried searching but I could not find anything"

JRPG,3b6zdi,Saibanchou,3,Fri Jun 26 14:13:29 2015 UTC,"The transition to battle took a solid 6 seconds which is a bit worrying. The PS2 version only took between 2 and 3 seconds. You'd think it'd be shorter not reading from a DVD so I was hoping it would be faster not slower.  Though the option to make battles go at 1.5 speed will probably more than make up for that. That's a nice feature.  Looks like Morrie uses Claws, Boomerangs, and Clubs while Red uses Fans, Whips, and Daggers. Nice to see they actually added a unique weapon type for them.  Morrie also knows both Kazing and Oomph apparently which are both really useful spells.  Also looks like Jessica isn't the only one getting outfits that change their appearance this time(there's also 3 more outfits for Jessica that they teased but didn't show)  Looking forward to it."

I've played both, and while Golden has some quality of life changes that are certainly welcome (like the Search function when you're fusing Personas), the core of the story isn't really affected. Here's a list of all the changes that the Golden version had.   Also, if you're interested and since you own the original PS2 version, there's a version of the game going around the interwebs that has all texts in English but the voices are in the original JP. You'd have to play on an emulator or have your PS2 modded, but if you like having the option I'd say it's worth a shot. The JP voices are pretty damn good (specially Nanako T.T)"

JRPG,3b6ijz,kaijumunky,3,Fri Jun 26 15:39:45 2015 UTC,I really really like the game.  Except how slow the battles are. I wish there was a fast-forward button or something.

JRPG,3b6ijz,kaijumunky,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"FOR REAL?! What kind of variable would I search for?  I've used Cheat Engine sporadically for games before, and have figured out how to modify stats, freeze time, avoid random battles, etc. Is it a framerate increase or something?"
JRPG,3b6ijz,Cake__Attack,2,Sat Jun 27 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"Oh hey if you've used cheat engine before this is easier. Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I think it's a framerate increase. The cool thing is that unlike a turbo on an emulator, the music doesn't get messed up. Anyway, here's how it works:   Start up the game, cheat engine, and open the game in cheat engine. I'm going to assume you know how to do this since you've used it before. There are two ways you can do it. If you just want to speed up the game all the time, just click enable speedhack on the right of the main window, and then set it to whatever factor you want things increased by. If you want to create a toggle, keep reading Go edit > settings > hotkeys. You'll see Speedhack 1,2,3,4 and 5. Go to Speedhack 1, and set whatever hotkey you want to speed 1.0. Yes, 1. Next, go to speedhack 2, and set that to whatever speed you want to increase things by. If you just want to skip through spell animations, maybe use 5.0, if you want it running for the entire battle, maybe 1.5 or 2.0. You're good. When you want to speed the game up, hit the speedhack 2 hotkey, when you want to go back to normal, hit the speedhack 1 hotkey. The only inconvenience is that as far as I know, there isn't a way to have one key that switches between normal and fast, you need to use a different key to speed up and slow down.  If you're using a gamepad then I don't think you can assign gamepad buttons to hotkeys in cheat engine (at least, I don't know how). To get around that, I just use xpadder to map buttons on my controller to the hotkeys."

If you've never heard of it, let me get one small detail of the way: it's a 18+ game. Yeah, it has sex scenes.  Anyway, for a game with its fair share of raunchy content it's quite impressive, since it has a LOT of (non-raunchy) content and its gameplay is pretty fun. It's an SRPG which resembles a mix of Fire Emblem (sans permadeath) + Atelier games, since the focus of the game is being an alchemist and gathering/craft everything you need. I strongly recommend it."
JRPG,3b6ijz,BobCrosswise,3,Sat Jun 27 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished a playthrough of a terrific fan-translated Japan-only Super Famicom game called Arabian Nights - Sabaku no Seirei Ou.  It's a wonderful game - one of the most enjoyable ones I've played in a long time.  The basic set-up - the main character is an orphan girl named Shukran who finds a magic ring that gives her control over a djinn named Ifrit - the former king of the djinn, who's been bound to this ring by a powerful mage, and must stay there until he's granted 1,000 wishes.  Shukran's wish will be number 1,000, and she wishes for him to help her bring peace to their land.  He's a bit taken aback - most people wish for youth or riches or the like, but she's sincere.  That's what she wants.  So that means that they first have to recover Ifrit's powers, which have been sealed away in predictably scattered and closely guarded crystals.  Along the way, they pick up a thief named Harty, and the three of them form the party throughout the game.  Shukran is absolutely adorable.  She's charming and upbeat and naively idealistic, often to the dismay of the other two characters.  Ifrit is unsurprisingly crabby, but essentially a decent enough sort, and Harty is a bit amoral, but also essentially decent.    Shukran uses mostly swords, though her best, and hidden, weapon is a red plastic toy hammer, and yes, it really does squeak when she hits an enemy.  Over the course of the game, they pick up items similar to Ifrit's ring that she can use to summon any of the other lesser djinn who were formerly Ifrit's allies, before they were all bound away, and when she summons one of them, it essentially serves as a fourth party member.  Many of those djinn are bosses along the way, but they are not only defeated by the party, but won over by Shukran's earnest charm.    Ifrit uses one of a succession of ""knuckles"" over his fists for physical attacks, and also gains a number of quite powerful but expensive spells from the crystals they recover along the way.    Harty uses a range of spears and thrown weapons and the like, and has a bunch of sort of ninja-like status effect spells that he gains along the way.  The overworld graphics are nice - not outstanding, but at least average or a bit above.  The combat graphics are pretty good, with different animations for the different weapons the characters can use.  The character portraits - both the player characters and the NPCs - are outstanding, and the characters themselves are terrific and memorable.  The combat is pretty good and uses an interesting card gimmick.  You can carry up to... I believe it's 16 cards.  They're of a range of ""suits"" corresponding with the elements in the game (also the elements of the crystals that you're trying to recover, and of all the other djinn over whom Ifrit was once king), and numbered from 1 to 5 (with the possibility of acquiring bonus cards numbered 0 later in the game).  You can play a card at the beginning of combat and at the beginning of each turn, and the cards have different effects - AoE elemental damage, increased defense, increased evasion, guaranteed crits, protection from crits, and so on.  If both sides try to play a card on the same turn, then the highest numbered one wins and takes effect.  If there's already a card in play (they last for three turns), then you can only play a card if it's the same suit and a higher number, a different suit and the same number or a 0.  Most of the cards don't make a whole lot of difference, but some of them are quite powerful, and they're crucial for boss fights.  The game is essentially open world from very early on.  The starting village is pinched between mountains, so it matters which side you leave from, and only one side is open at the beginning, so your very first trip out of the city is limited by that.  Then the other gate opens, and you're free to travel all of that continent.  You soon get a magic carpet that allows you to travel faster and without random encounters, but still won't cross mountains or oceans, then fairly quickly after that you have the possibility of taming a roc, who will fly you absolutely anywhere.  The game is fairly short.  My first time through took a bit more than 19 hours.  I played it a second time, partly just because I enjoyed it that much, but partly because it has multiple endings, and in order to get the best ending, you have to complete it in under 15 hours.  And the good ending was well worth the second playthrough.  All in all, it's a great game - easily a 9.  I recommend it very strongly."

But coming from strategy game it has been hard to adapt to the balance of the game : even so you shoot some dude in the head one inch from him, just cause he is an officer he won't die in one hit, unless you use the sniper.

Legend of Legia 2 Rough to look at, but fun enough. Basic plot. Fights get repetitive fast. Haven't been truly challenged yet.  Star Ocean: Til the End of Time Another pretty easy game, though, fights tend to just happen at their own pace and it gets confusing easy. Gold acquisition/costs ratio seems off in spending's favor. Still have a lot of game to go.  Tales of the Abyss  This has quickly become one of my favorite RPGs. I feel like I'm missing a lot, but I don't feel like its hurting me. Looks good for PS2, story takes a while to shape up, and can be sluggish.   Persona 4 I want to like this game, I really do. The combat seems so repetitive, and I've always been a fan of turn-based JRPGs. I haven't really gotten into the social sim part yet, and it kind of worries me. I just don't know if I like that much micro-managing. I hear Golden is just far better than the PS2 version, so I won't judge, but I'm not 100% sold on the game."

Finally decided to try the IZJS and it's really working for me so far. I feel like it gives real gravity to the decisions you make for developing each character and forces me to use all the characters to have strategies for different situations. Also the L1 speed up is a god send.

Really a blast, find myself actually looking forward to battles which is somewhat of a rarity in a lot of JRPGs. Story doesn't makes much sense but I went in knowing that it wasn't a very strong point of the game. Vaan is also a pretty bad main character, Ashe was far more deserving of that role, which is why I play as her."

Seems to have decent replayability but requires a guide to understand and find all the extras. Though the extras aren't needed and the game came across as very easy to me. But I did just come off of FFIV DS version which had a brutal final dungeon.  Now I'm starting back into Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime. Simple but fun game. The DQ monsters are just so adorable. Seems like the story is very short though. Haven't been playing long and I'm already at about 30/100 slimes.

The weird focus in the story on characters that you don't play as is weird.   Breath of Fire 3, 4, and 5. I am actually on hiatus for all of them. I am enjoying each of them, being furthest into three. It is so much fun. Five's mechanics are very unique, and the combat is a blast. Kinda sucks to play through the game so often, but it is worth it.   Wild Arms one and two. I have played and beaten both, but they are so good that I can replay them without a care in the world. I actually play these when I feel like it. Not on any set schedule, just if I am in the mood. Strangely simple RPGs that are easy to jump into. I love that about them.   Parasite Eve 2.

It's just not as polished or interesting, and mechanics like getting tired are annoying. Also played Strange Journey and Devil Survivor and it's tough to go back to the relative streamlining of Persona.   Demon's Gaze-- Shaping up to be a really solid dungeon crawler with a few original ideas of its own. Big step up from Class of Heroes 2, which felt cheap and clunky. I don't really mind the excessive T&A, though it is kind of skeezy, but I do mind the horrible soundtrack...oh, it's Vocaloid? That explains it.  Etrian Mystery Dungeon-- Maybe I just don't like console-style roguelikes, but I couldn't really get into Sorcery Saga either (though this is better). Part of the problem is there's exactly one kind of dungeon layout-- box rooms connected by single-space hallways, Nethack-style. Boring! Also, maybe it's just me, but seems like my party has a tendency to just stand around at times. Still, credit for adding in new ideas like town development and forts."

JRPG,3b3ak3,studiosupport,3,Thu Jun 25 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the games, I originally took interest in the series due to liking other SRPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem, and the Disgaea series plays pretty similarly to those.  Probably the biggest differences I have found to other games in the genre is that Disgaea really focuses a lot on level grinding even more than most games, and it has a very silly plot usually and never takes itself too seriously but that is the fun part to me.  I really love the games and would definitely recommend them."

JRPG,3b3ak3,foyboy,3,Thu Jun 25 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"I would never compare Disgaea to FFT or FE, aside from them both being SRPGs. Disgaea is tactically weak with an abysmal AI. It's entirely about the post-game grind to make superpowered units with higher stats than the enemies.  I absolutely love the Disgaea series, and have put in 100+ hours into each of the main games in the series, as well as D2. But do not go in expecting a tactically deep game similar to FFT or FE. This game is for people who love to grind, similar to an MMORPG.  Also, the story of the first game is hilarious and different (you play as the ""villain""), but recent installments have failed to capture that magic."
JRPG,3b3ak3,mysticrudnin,2,Thu Jun 25 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"The main stories are actually pretty engaging, especially 4. The grindfest is totally optional (and super fun) but I stopped doing it after 2 and just enjoyed the main stories."

JRPG,3b3ak3,mysticrudnin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:02:36 2015 UTC,"It's still like a 20-30 hour game with pretty decent strategy and storyline. Since they're on sale on psn for $10 all the time, I think that's pretty good. I didn't do postgame for 3 and 4 and enjoyed them well enough."

You can tell they're not really seeking local sales because the voice acting is only in english. So you can infer WRPGs aren't taking over in the east, even though WRPGs from Japan are very successful globally."
JRPG,3b3ghi,Jamaz,5,Fri Jun 26 12:34:12 2015 UTC,You can tell they're not really seeking local sales because the voice acting is only in english   The English voice acting is an artistic decision. It's been like that since Demon's Souls which wasn't even intended for release in the West.
JRPG,3b3ghi,Brownski,3,Fri Jun 26 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"Also, Wizardry-style dungeon crawlers are released by the dozens in Japan every few months anyway, and have been for decades, so to the Japanese, these kinds of games aren't some rediscovered long-lost relic and they don't go out and buy them in droves."
JRPG,3b3ghi,red_sutter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:40:28 2015 UTC,"Japanese games not always have a japanese dub, and in most cases it's done because ""it fits the story"". The biggest example I can think off are the original Resident Evil games: they were all voiced in English because they were set in the United States (and because Shinji Mikami thought the JP dub they used at first sucked, which is ironic because RE was known for it's laughable voice acting)."
JRPG,3b3ghi,Zaloon,3,Sun Jun 28 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"There are JRPGs that mimick WRPGs (Like FFXV), but they're in the minority.  I think they're doing that more because they want to cater to Western gamers, though, not because it's popular in the East."

JRPG,3b3ghi,mysticrudnin,2,Fri Jun 26 03:47:44 2015 UTC,"I can share based on what my Japanese friends mostly play (in Japan.)   For the most part, the ones who build PCs are interested in western games: PC components are waaaaay more expensive in Japan (better now than before compared to the dollar, but only because the yen is much weaker than it was five years ago.) We're talking twice as expensive based on relative disposable income. PC gaming is definitely much more of a niche in Japan outside of a few exceptions.  Skyrim is pretty popular among this crowd (you'll notice there's actually a pretty big Japanese modding community for Bethesda games.) The Witcher sold fairly okay for a western game, but honestly I had never even heard of the series in the states until the third one was announced.   For those who don't build their own PCs, they mostly play f2p MMOs at net cafés. Those are largely JRPG based.   For console gamers in Japan though, Japanese games and hardware are way more popular. You won't see japanese players playing western games (even outside of the rpg genre) almost at all on a console."
JRPG,3b3ghi,meikyoushisui,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"So, I have to be the obvious guy saying that what's popular isn't what's relevant?"
JRPG,3b3ghi,kaneel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:55:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is why most JRPGs still lean toward being anime-styled.  The big exception being SquEAnix who prefer to target the lowest common denominator, and focus on making things look nice for the western crowds.  Which explains why the niche RPGs are so much better than Final Fantasy now."
JRPG,3b3ghi,Zilveari,11,Thu Jun 25 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"This is only semi-true, I think. The hyper-anime games that Nippon Ichi, Idea Factory and Compile Heart release tend to not set the charts on fire when they come out. Some do, like Tales, but mainstream Japanese tastes seem to shy away from hyper-anime. Indeed, it's still Final Fantasy which sells the best - even Lightning Returns, a game generally considered to not be a massive commercial success, sold 277,000 at launch compared to Disgaea 4, which opened at about 80,000 and was considered to be a successful launch.   I think that in recent years, with more and more developers in Japan shying away from console releases, the proportion of anime styled games is higher, with Tales on the rise in the West and lots of NIS, Compile Heart and Idea Factory games coming out, with lessened Square Enix output to boot. Looking back at the golden age games, lots had anime influence, but few were as overtly anime as the output of the above."
JRPG,3b3ghi,HyakuShiki0812,3,Thu Jun 25 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not just talking about the niche ones.  Persona and Tales are also very anime-esque, and are top 5 along with FF, DQ, and Star Ocean IMO.    You also forgot to mention Gust, who did Ar tonelico and the Atelier series."
JRPG,3b3ghi,Zilveari,4,Thu Jun 25 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"I would have said that Gust games were quite niche, too (Atelier Shallie launched at around 44,000, for example).   Persona, I think, is unique, because it's a spin-off that outsells its main series brethren (for example, in PS2 sales alone (plus another 137,000 at the Japanese Vita launch), P4 managed 193,000 to Shin Megami Tensei 4's 188,000). But this is why I said it's semi-true - Tales and Persona prove that of course there's an appetite for games with a very heavy anime influence, especially with Tales.   Speaking personally, I think that Tales has always strived towards being a playable shonen anime in a lot of ways - flashy moves, meolodramatic storylines, flashes of comedy and drama mixed together - that's the bread and butter of Tales and the core of its charm - it is very much an 'anime game', and thematically and aesthetically it is 'anime'. However, Persona's bread and butter I think has a more limited anime influence, being mostly within concept art and character design. The aesthetic of the engine is a fairly realistic one, all things considered, and thematically it goes where shonen anime daren't. Persona games are based in personal-level interaction, tactical battles, and choice - it's a pen and paper RPG with a light anime skin on it."
JRPG,3b3ghi,HyakuShiki0812,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about moe as a stylistic choice, but is it possible that older games had an anime influence before moe as a visual style because popular?"
JRPG,3b3ghi,radios_appear,4,Thu Jun 25 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. The golden-era games definitely had anime influences - Chrono Trigger, for example, one of the most beloved SNES classics, for instance, had Toriyama artwork and he was a best-selling manga artist. What's more, it's only natural that the game creators of Japan would be influenced by manga and anime - probably most of them had been fans of it at some time or another.   However, in most cases, I think the influence was lesser. It tended to manifest more in concept artwork, in character development, and in visual effects, but necessarily in plot structure, gameplay design or the like. While Tales games have always played like a playable anime (not that there's anything wrong with that - damn, the unapologetically strong anime look is one of the most charming things about the series) I think that the games of the SNES-PS1 era drew far more influence from elsewhere - from pen and paper RPGs, certainly, and also from other media. Parasite Eve is, of course, a sequel to the book of the same name, Star Ocean's developers quite obviously watched a lot of Star Trek, Xenogears is based in religious dogma and could feasibly be used in a bible studies class, Wild Arms is obviously based on Spaghetti Westerns, and Suikoden is based on a classical Chinese novel called Water Margin or Shui Hu Zhuan. As a result, I think that they had more diversity and were more bold in the content they took inspiration from. Nowadays, far fewer JRPGs are exploring the diverse array of content that they used to and the genre as a whole seems to have retreated into its safety zone a bit. Not that there aren't games still coming out exploring these things - the likes of Final Fantasy Type-0, for instance. But I can't blame non-JRPG fans for thinking that JRPGs in recent years have been quite cookie-cutter and uninspired.   I mean, let's be realistic, how marketable really is game called Suikoden with a plot based on a book called Shui Hu Zhuan?"
JRPG,3b3ghi,HyakuShiki0812,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:29:25 2015 UTC,Do you think Japanese games would sell better with English titles? Is that all it would take to kick off the success of some Japanese companies in the States and in Europe?
JRPG,3b3ghi,radios_appear,2,Thu Jun 25 19:39:08 2015 UTC,"Well, from a PR/marketing perspective it would probably help. But that's beside the point. It's more that in the modern game development environment a game like Suikoden based on material that few people in Japan and even fewer people in the west have ever heard of wouldn't be considered for a greenlight."
JRPG,3b3ghi,HyakuShiki0812,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:53:04 2015 UTC,You are also seeing a lot of old jrpg's release for the ios and android. I think this is a sign of where Japan is right now with the gaming which is always on the go... The ds and 3ds ib recent years has also been hit with some real quality releases. Good point.
JRPG,3b3ghi,Jamaz,0,Thu Jun 25 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"WRPGs are the powerhouse globally with Bioware, Bethesda, and Projekt constantly pumping out profitable AAA titles that exceed several million copies sold. If you check the sales in Japan, however, WRPGs actually never do that well. I think the sales of these games number in the tens of thousands in Japan whereas DQ and FF normally sell a million+ there. It's just a very different different consumer base and media culture. Plus, Japanese don't touch XBOX or PC and probably don't enjoy non-dubbed games which reduces the WRPG sales even more."

JRPG,3aytpb,mysticrudnin,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:37 2015 UTC,I'd be even happier if a Megaten game sold something like 10 million. That's going above and beyond the call of Fantasy.
JRPG,3aytpb,MegidoJo,4,Thu Jun 25 05:04:54 2015 UTC,I think they've learned that lesson. Bravely Default was the best Final Fantasy game we've had in years. And I think this Tokyo RPG Factory group they've started is a response to that.
JRPG,3aytpb,Animedingo,5,Wed Jun 24 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"I think Bravely Default made them rethink that philosophy. Even Tabata, director of FFXV, said that there is still much room for a turn-based FF game, but it's just that they wanted to make it an action title."

What made P4 such amazing game was the huge cast of characters and how they were all vastly unique to each other.  I wanted to give P5 a chance. Telling myself this is only a teaser, that this is only a fraction of playable characters in the game.  Yet we still stuck with these three, blandly similar characters. I honestly can no longer be hype on this. I sense only disappointment from here on out."
JRPG,3aytpb,kraidia,24,Wed Jun 24 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"It's honestly ridiculous to be making judgments on the game this early still. All of the gameplay shown basically features the first ""week"" in-game - if we look at P4, half the team members came in way later in the game. Kanji, Rise, and most notably Naoto enter the game months later and I would probably expect something similar for P5. Yes, Atlus has been very disappointing with their trailer reveals (I was pretty disappointed by this trailer), but to assume that the game will be disappointing based on that is foolish, at best."

JRPG,3aytpb,ExpressRabbit,7,Wed Jun 24 21:00:08 2015 UTC,"What would you think if you only saw a 2-minute trailer for Persona 3 or Persona 4? I'm sure you could easily classify the characters as uninteresting. Shinjiro looks like a cliche antisocial loner, and Kanji looks like a classic punk. Yet both of these characters are pretty great.   It's kind of hard to convey character depth in a 2-minute trailer. I have full confidence Atlus will make these characters interesting, as even some of the less interesting characters like Fuuka are still interesting.  I'm sure there will be more than the 3 characters promoted in these videos. But even if there aren't, that's not necessary a bad thing. That's just an opportunity to develop them even further.  And even if they depart from the core gameplay mechanics of Persona 3/4 (and I highly doubt they will), that's not a bad thing either. Do you remember how different Persona 3 was from the rest of the series? People were skeptical, but it turned out to be a great game."

JRPG,3b5oeh,LocalsingleDota,4,Fri Jun 26 11:46:01 2015 UTC,"On a mechanical level, 13 was a modern revamp of ATB. The fact that the meat of the combat was very samey speaks less of the mechanical design and more of the AI and skill design. The bones were strong, calcified classical JRPG combat with a new wealth of player choices possible only by taking that early turn and not cashing in a full bar. If they'd implemented it better, we'd be praising it as the bold reimagining of the greatest JRPG turn system of all time, turning Civilisation into Starcraft.  The fact that they fucked it up so royally is, in my opinion, proof that Square-Enix has lost touch with the things that made them great. They've been so busy trying to make the Western JRPG that they've lost the plot. They abandoned the simplicity of XP to add a false level of choice in character development. They made characters that are visually interesting but tonally bland. Bright colors have given way to dull, muddy, washed-out tones.   I understand the need to move forward with your franchise, move forward as creators, but the way they've been advancing has been full of missteps and faulty starts. This is, of course,  only my opinion."
JRPG,3b5oeh,zaro27,0,Fri Jun 26 12:35:02 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're putting too much thought into it. Combat was just boring. Read Cactuar's description below."

It's become a childish shitshow over in r/FinalFantasy - every day a resounding chorus of ""FFVII:R needs a new battle system and if you don't think so you're dumb!""  People who argue in favor of the classic battle system are rarely even being rude or annoying about it but they are still drowning in downvotes.  Sorry, bit of a rant, but I know if I shared it there I'd be downvoted as well. Thanks r/JRPG for supporting constructive conversation regarding the topic. :)"
JRPG,3b5oeh,chordgasms,0,Sat Jun 27 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"I am in the camp of wanting total turn based battle system, however I understand why they feel its not a great idea. That being said, here is what I think would be the best way to appease older fans and newer ones:  A battle system that is a blend of FF12 and Xenoblade Chronicles. Free movement and auto attacks in addition to whatever ability or magic you want to cast.....but here is what would make it work for us classic fans.....the ability to pause combat and issue orders to your party. This way, those who want to play turn based basically can, and those who want real time action can do that as well."
JRPG,3b5oeh,AKABoondock,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"I also loved the combat of FF12 because I was a heavy MMO player and always dreamed about a battle system like that. For once, my robot AI allies weren't dumb as rocks either."
JRPG,3aybsx,bws201,14,Wed Jun 24 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"Exploring planets and what not sounds cool and all, but what's wrong with scenario-driven games that everyone's wishing everything was open world?"
JRPG,3aybsx,zerosaver,2,Wed Jun 24 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think open world could work really well for Star Ocean, but I definitely agree with this idea. People aren't nearly as excited for scenario driven games, which sucks to me because the best RPGs ever weren't open world. Chrono Trigger is a perfect example of a game that gives the player options but maintains that beautiful sense of direction, progression, and control of themes that a scenario-driven game can offer. I wish that was the idea that got people hyped instead of ""well people want choice so let's make every game an open environment with icons and knick knacks scattered randomly for no meaningful reason"".  The pendulum will eventually swing away from open world, though. Modern hardware enables this type of experience better than ever before, it's just that some of us got tired of it faster than everyone else."
JRPG,3aybsx,Electrium,5,Wed Jun 24 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Aren't JRPGs all about the story, though? I, too, love choices and multiple endings, but I think a truly open world game would be hard to pull off while still keeping the JRPG feel. The whole selling point of open world is free exploration of the game world, but to be able to create a sound story, there has to be limits here and there.  TL;DR I'm just not sold on how they can make Star Ocean (or any JRPG franchise in general) into an open world game without throwing storytelling out the window."
JRPG,3aybsx,zerosaver,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I doubt they would go ""truly open world"" like DayZ or Minecraft or something based on emergent gameplay. I would assume by open world in a JRPG context they're referring to something more like Xenoblade or FF15."
JRPG,3aybsx,Electrium,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:57:02 2015 UTC,Xenoblade balanced it fantastically well imo.
JRPG,3aybsx,mreiland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:40:09 2015 UTC,No joke. That game can be almost exactly as linear or as open as you want it to be. I might have done one sidequest in the entire 70-80 hours I spent with that game but I still felt like I did plenty of things for fun outside of the main story.
JRPG,3aybsx,Electrium,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Best stories are hand crafted beginning to end. Open world games just drag you all over and you get lost in the game and the story suffers. Having that problem with the Witcher 3. Great game, and the story segments are great, but unless you keep yourself focused on the story then it gets dragged out, and you feel pulled everywhere. Then again, the Witcher 3 does such a great job of keeping the world consistent and atmospherically potent that it suffers the least of open world games.   I think the biggest offender are the chose your own path games. So many portions feel tacked on, or just going through the motions in order to make a player feel like they have choice."
JRPG,3aybsx,Indoorsman,8,Sat Jun 27 05:22:02 2015 UTC,"I LOVE IT, BRING IT ON   Could you imagine Star Ocean with real space exploration? Like you can fly a spaceship and discover planets and go there and do stuff? YES YES YES"
JRPG,3aybsx,metagloria,3,Wed Jun 24 16:14:03 2015 UTC,I'm normally not one for shoving open world stuff in every game but it's too perfect for Star Ocean. I used to have a lot of fun with alchemy in SO3 - gathering all kinds of different materials would be a great incentive for exploring new places and would probably kill off that dragging feeling of backtracking.
JRPG,3aybsx,Electrium,2,Wed Jun 24 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"that doesn't sound like Star Ocean to me.  Sounds fine, but not what I think of when I think Star Ocean."

JRPG,3avnun,Tarul,65,Tue Jun 23 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"WRPG and JRPG are two completely different genres - they have nothing to do with where the game was developed, just like ""Italian food"" doesn't have to come directly from Italy to be ""Italian.""  JRPGs are usually very story-focused, almost always with a pre-set protagonist with a pre-set history and personality, usually with a given or default name. They usually focus much more on numbers and dice rolls than player input, and are frequently turn based or have some kind of turn-based function.  WRPGs are much more player-focused, usually with an ""avatar"" type protagonist who the player gets to name and design, and even decide their own personality - the protagonist in a WRPG is not a unique character, but rather an avatar for the player to insert themselves into the world. WRPG gameplay tends to be less number-focused and more skill-based, and the gameplay centers around exploring the world and doing whatever you want to do rather than following an extremely linear story progression. Gameplay is often more actiony and not usually turn based.  These are different genres because they are VERY distinct gameplay styles - they are as different as a first person shooter and a third person shooter. Both are shooters but they both have very distinct elements to their gameplay that affects the experience - same is true here.  They're only named as such for the same reason that Italian food is called Italian food - the JRPG style was most popularized in Japan, with series like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Megami Tensei. The WRPG is popularized in the west with things like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, the Witcher, and Bioware's games.  It is possible for a JRPG to be developed in the west and still be a JRPG. It is also possible for a WRPG to be made by a Japanese studio and still be a WRPG. Examples of WRPGs made by Japanese developers could include Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma. Examples of JRPGs made by Western developers might include Child of Light and South Park: The Stick of Truth.   Both DS and DD have open world gameplay, with a heavy bias towards action over numbers, they both have playable characters functioning as an avatar, and they both focus on the player exploring the world as their core gameplay element, with the plotline itself taking a backseat.  CoL and SP, however, both have turn-based gameplay, they both have plotlines at their forefront of gameplay, and they both have protagonists who are their own individual character and not an avatar for the player.  Again, ""JRPG"" does NOT in any way mean ""rpg made in Japan."" That would be an absolutely worthless genre description because not every game or every RPG made in Japan is similar. Likewise, not every RPG made by a western studio is a WRPG by default.  Genre exist for us to make distinctions between types of games easily. They exist so we can tell someone what sort of gameplay a game might have briefly without explaining it - if a game has you running and jumping on platforms with some light puzzle solving elements, it's easier to just say it's a puzzle-platformer. If a game features a first person perspective in which combat consists of shooting enemies at range with a variety of weapons, it's easier to say it's an FPS.  Genres only make sense if they actually have a unique, recognizable aspect to them. Genres HAVE to be based on gameplay, on the game itself. Making a genre based on the location it was made in is ridiculous, because it defeats the purpose of even having a genre - saying a game is Japanese will tell someone VERY little about how it actually plays. Mario is Japanese, Zelda is Japanese, Pokemon is Japanese, and yet all of those are very, very different games.  Similarly, Call of Duty, Bioshock, The Witcher, and Skyrim are very different games, and so saying ""this game is western"" is meaningless as well.  Going back to the food metaphor, we don't call Italian food Italian because it was made in Italy. You can make Italian food in America and have it still be Italian food - it's called Italian because it has a specific style and flavor that was popularized in Italy. If you told your friends you were taking them out for American food and took them to an Italian restaraunt, they'd be confused, even if your logic is ""but this is all made in America, it's American food."" Italian and American food are styles, not descriptions of origin. They have nothing in common, so you can't really call Italian food American food even if it's made in America, because Olive Garden and McDonald's have very little in common.  That's why you can't call a game like Dark Souls a JRPG - Dark Souls and Final Fantasy have almost nothing in common, so why would you group them under the same genre? It would be just as ridiculous to group Zelda and Mario under the same genre just because they're both Nintendo games.   And yes, there are many games that blend elements of both genres together - Final Fantasy XII and Xenoblade both have many elements common to WRPGs, especially their combat, but I still consider them JRPGs because they have a story focus and not player interaction focus.  Basically, to summarize - a JRPG usually has less focus on gameplay and more on story, plot, characters, etc. A WRPG usually has more focus on player interaction with the world and less on the actual story. That's the core difference - where the game itself is made is irrelevant. Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma aren't JRPGs because they're Japanese games - they're Japanese-developed WRPGs. South Park and Child of Light, similarly, are Western-developed JRPGs.   Also, if you're wondering why this is important, try telling someone who likes JRPGs and not WRPGs to play Dragon's Dogma - I bet they won't like it. The genres are very different, it's important that you not confuse people by telling them a game is a genre it isn't. Telling someone a game is a JRPG implies that the gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, so if it feels like Skyrim they'll be disappointed. Similarly, telling someone a game is a WRPG implies the gameplay is more like Skyrim or Dragon Age, so if they find turn-based combat and a linear story they'll likewise be disappointed. If you want a non-RPG example, telling someone Dark Souls is a JRPG because technically it was made in Japan is like telling someone Portal is a FPS because it's technically first person and you technically shoot things. According to the words alone you may technically be right, but you're still missing the point."
JRPG,3avnun,butterfly1763,6,Tue Jun 23 22:07:46 2015 UTC,This should be an entry in this sub's wiki. Couldn't agree more with you.
JRPG,3avnun,fanboy_killer,3,Wed Jun 24 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"A big thing to note is that you say ""usually"" and ""almost"" and there's a huge reason for that: you can easily find JRPGs that have ""WRPG"" mechanics, and vice versa.  I think the thing that most sets each one into its respective genre is how many of these ""tends to"" mechanics they have. You could make a list of mechanics and say which they're indicative of, and then try to count them up on a per-game basis.  There's a bit of the coastline paradox here, where the harder you try to define the genres, the more meaningless it all becomes and the more confused you get. ""I know it when I see it"" works well enough, but isn't a very good metric for use in arguments :)  It also really depends on what you're looking for in games. On a very personal and opinionated level, the main reason I prefer JRPGs over WRPGs is that the gameplay is much, much better. They are more engaging, have more meaningful choices to be made (I often get pushback on this, but I find that many WRPGs the ""choices"" are really just how you want your animations to look when you deal damage and that is not choice to me) and just all around have better concepts of ""progression"" and ""combat"" to me. A big part of this is the abstraction - WRPGs often try to mimic real situations and have a lot of behind-the-scenes dice rolls doing this, while JRPGs don't care and are abstract - and coming from a board-game background, this is often much more preferred for me. It's almost impossible for me to imagine a WRPG that uses, say, a card game as its battle system, and yet I can name numerous JRPGs (both action and turn-based) that do exactly that. So I disagree strongly that JRPGs focus less on gameplay - but someone who's looking for a huge world with a ton of stuff to do and a ton of little options and bits of freedom and generally just skips through battles is going to see very little and agree with you."
JRPG,3avnun,mysticrudnin,3,Wed Jun 24 17:26:22 2015 UTC,I've recently seen more people saying roughly this and I'm glad to see it.  JRPG/WRPG has been distinct genre's for 10+ years now and it drives me nuts when I see people make assumptions based purely on the name and then argue with those who got to watch the genre's come about and solidify.
JRPG,3avnun,mreiland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:44:43 2015 UTC,By ur analogy then kingdom hearts ff14 11 and 15 isn't a jrpg cause it isnt turn based jrpgs are bigger than that hence the inception of action jrpgs the problem with the food analogy is that quite similar to what's happening to video games is that people change what is consistent in how a culture makes their food and many times there are philosophical reasons as to why its make that way that is consistent with their way of life like video games hence why focus on gamplay is important just because a game is turn based doesn't mean its jrpg turn based is not relegated to jrpg just because there is customization in a game doesn't necessarily mean its wrpg while small on customization pokemon is not story focused it comes down to the focus in gameplay that is ever so evident in that genre costume quest another turn based rpg doesn't feel like a jrpg based on the way the game plays how the souls games play are consistent with how the Japanese approach making games because there is always a philosophical reason why the game operates the way it does while child of light has Japanese influence the way how it plays is not exactly similar to how the Japanese create games

JRPG,3avnun,starlizzle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:58:10 2015 UTC,Very well said. I just slightly disagree with the souls games. I think those games are more similar to monster hunter games. With a great emphasis on the battles. I know that there is a leveling aspect to dark souls but I don't think it is either a western or jrpg. I would say it is a genre of its own.
JRPG,3avnun,HnNaldoR,2,Wed Jun 24 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on that - I really hesitate to call Souls games an RPG at all myself. Mostly in the context of this post I was just saying that, between being a WRPG or a JRPG, they're definitely closer to WRPG. Personally I tend to consider them open world-ish action games with RPG elements."
JRPG,3avnun,butterfly1763,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:34:54 2015 UTC,It's definitely closer to a western rpg. I agree that it has action aspects to it and open world action game is quite a good fit but action game is so vague. Zelda and monster hunter can both be considered action but they are entirely different.
JRPG,3avnun,HnNaldoR,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's more accurate to say that it's about the spectrum of genres between JRPGs and WRPGs. Origin Country does matter because it inevitably influences design. Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma are irregular, JRPG'sh WRPGs precisely because they were made by Japanese. (More accurately, all genres are a 3D spectrum with infinitely multiple directions.)"
JRPG,3avnun,MultiWords,8,Wed Jun 24 06:42:49 2015 UTC,"One of the bigger culprits of the 'is it a JRPG' lately is South Park. It has the vast majority of things that are in JRPGs, the only real difference (outside of the subject matter) is that it wasn't made in Japan.  You have battles, somewhat of a story, experience, items, puzzles, etc. It's just not made in Japan.  I feel like we need to recognize that JRPG is just the style of game now, and not specifically from Japan."
JRPG,3avnun,Vinceisg0d,3,Tue Jun 23 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And conversely, Dark Souls is a game from Japan that plays very similarly to what most people consider a WRPG. Honestly, I kind of want a genre than specifically designated whether a game is anime-rooted in nature or not. A game being produced from Japan or US doesn't really tell me much about the experience anymore."
JRPG,3avnun,mysticrudnin,2,Tue Jun 23 22:11:36 2015 UTC,"that plays very similarly to what most people consider a WRPG   I disagree. Skill-based combat is atypical in WRPGs. Many, many WRPGs have gear checks and die rolls, and on occasion the abuse of AI."
JRPG,3avnun,rglitched,2,Wed Jun 24 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"I like the split too, because I'm tired of people calling Dark Souls a JRPG."

JRPG,3avnun,HnNaldoR,5,Wed Jun 24 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"So, personally, I've always considered JRPGs to be games from Japan. For context, I've been a huge Fire Emblem and Tales fan for a long time, and I've always considered JRPGs to be games to have roots with anime culture, which extends from Chrono Trigger to Xenoblade.  However, after playing the Mass Effect series and Child of Light (which I absolutely loved! any similar game recommendations would be greatly appreciated), I realized that quite a few RPGs from the west shared gameplay features, grand stories, themes, etc of the typical parts that make up a JRPG.  Despite this, though, I still consider JRPGs to be games from Japan and WRPGs to be games from the west. Why?    It's easier for me to tell friends that a game is made from Japan instead of being made in the West The West has different cultural values and social interactions from the East. While the difference is slowly being blended away. However, this does explain why JRPGs have that ""anime-y"" feeling with character tropes that aren't very common in Western media (for example, the tsundere archetype isn't as popular in Western media as in Japan. It still exists, but it's usually more along the lines of Korra, with a headstrong female who doesn't take anything from anyone.)   Truth be told, the boundaries are becoming slimmer, and I find it harder for me to separate games based on their gameplay characteristics, character archetypes, and story elements between Japan and the West, especially when games like Dark Souls come around.  Anyways, I'd love to hear your thoughts."
JRPG,3avnun,mysticrudnin,2,Tue Jun 23 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"I think games like FE /advance wars/ Valk Chronicles should not be a considered as a jrpg. Games nowadays have aspects from multiple genres and it is hard to fit it onto a genre. But the main aspects of these games is the strategy or turn based tactics rather than the rpg element. So, it should be considered a strategy rpg or tactics rpg. People don't consider xcom a rpg and I think xcom and fe should be considered a similar genre."
JRPG,3avnun,mreiland,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"This is where it gets tough.  Normally I can just say SRPG and count those games (not Advance Wars, it's TBS) - including Fire Emblem and X-Com. But sometimes it is necessary for me to specify J-SRPG. Not always, but sometimes. And here I must admit I don't know enough about x-Com to really continue this conversation, so I should do more research. Because if people don't consider it an RPG then maybe my thoughts on the games are wrong. Because Fire Emblem is unambiguously an RPG to me.  ARPG is interesting because the genre itself has multiple meanings, and then the differences between J-ARPGs and other ARPGs are huge. First, many people use ""ARPG"" to mean games like Diablo (and that's all) while others will also use ARPG to mean games like Dark Souls. But for JRPG players, we also use this to mean JRPGs with action combat, like Kingdom Hearts or Tales, which are very, very different from both other definitions here."
JRPG,3avnun,xRichard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"they're SRPG's, Tarul is just making shit up.  Anyone is free to define things however they way, but FE is an SRPG, end of story."
JRPG,3avnun,cg001,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"I think that reading up on the history on the genre will allow you to find answers on where these differences come from. This is an excellent video on how JPRGs became a thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sglKS-HfZMw  On Dark Souls, I think the game's design is more Japanese than western. Mostly because of how the control works, but even the setting takes a lot of inspiration from Japanese works that take place in western fantasy setting like Berserk or Claymore."
JRPG,3avnun,Evrae_Altana,4,Wed Jun 24 00:06:59 2015 UTC,I feel jrpgs focus more on stories and teams.   Wrpgs focus more on choices and exploration.   Jrpgs don't have to be from Japan and Wrpgs don't have to be from Western countries.
JRPG,3avnun,Dan_Tsukasa,6,Tue Jun 23 22:39:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree with most on this. I find the cultural differences between Japanese games and North American games to be distinct and interesting. Sweeping them both under the same category whenever they start to show similarities in mere mechanical design downplays this cultural upbringing. It even becomes insulting when someone claims that a game is no longer Japanese merely because the development team is straying away from designs seen in the 80s and 90s. By that logic, JRPGs must remain fairly traditional to be credited as Japanese. Otherwise they are Western, as some would label FF12 or Dark Souls. It's completely reductionist.  So yes: South Park is a WRPG. FFVI is a JRPG. Neither becomes more Western or Japanese the moment you point out a noted influence in a how a turn-system works. Where your development team is from greatly influences their work. It doesn't boil down to anime eyes versus dialogue wheels. Play RPGs developed in Europe (i.e The Witcher series) and differences can be richly examined.   JRPGs are from Japan, period. In a future where the world and cultures are more globalized, that label may become outdated. Currently though, Japan is very distinctly Japan."
JRPG,3avnun,Evrae_Altana,3,Tue Jun 23 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think thats a bit too strict, I agree sort of, but this strictness would mean Mistwalker games aren't Japanese because they're made in Hawaii, with a part Japanese design team, same with FF9 where a large number of the staff were western and the game was developed in Hawaii too, but those are still both JRPGS.  I'd say its more of a gameplay thing, various design decisions, most JRPGS and WRPGS you can simply look at the visuals and often guess where it comes from (most, games like Dark Souls it gets a lot harder)."
JRPG,3avnun,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"I could get ridiculous and boil it down to who's heading or directing the project. But yeah I think you're right, and that's why I think the term might become antiquated once development teams intermingle more often."
JRPG,3avnun,Evrae_Altana,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"True, but then its strictness thats going to box you into a few games.  I mean few final fantasy titles were made by a SOLEY Japanese dev team, and those are still JRPGS, no sense in boxing it up so much I think.  I'm a developer myself and I'm working on a JRPG right now as I type this, after that I hope to work on my own (much smaller) JRPG."

JRPG,3avnun,mysticrudnin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"I think lots of people are forgetting that Japan has a rich history of action RPGs. Yes typical JRPG is turn based, but there was tons of action based ones too. So splitting them just based on that does not work."
JRPG,3avnun,mysticrudnin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:33:08 2015 UTC,"By that logic, JRPGs must remain fairly traditional to be credited as Japanese.   This is false. I don't think your premise nor your logical jumps are sound.  JRPGs have grown and changed just like WRPGs have. In fact, this is very pronounced in the dungeon crawler genre, which used to be nearly the very definition of WRPG but has slowly crawled over to JRPG territory. This is because the meaning of JRPG and WRPG has slowly changed based on modern titles and what modern fans of these genres are looking for. Dungeon Crawlers don't have the ""open world, exploration"" stuff down most of the time, nor do they have the ""Kill the shopkeeper, steal his stuff, never get caught"" freedom that WRPG fans crave, but they do have deep, abstract combat systems usually including a healthy understanding of party-synergy as well as out-of-combat skills.  FFXIII's battle system is anything but traditional, and yet it is very obviously a JRPG. Kingdom Hearts takes a ton of influence from modern action games (which used to be the antithesis of a classic RPG), but is a JRPG. Extremely abstract games like Knights in the Nightmare are JRPGs despite being made up of an amalgamation of mechanics, some of which didn't exist in the 80s and early 90s at all."
JRPG,3avnun,MultiWords,0,Wed Jun 24 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"I also use JRPGs to mean games that are from Japan. It's just less confusing and easier to understand when communicating with other people. On the flipside, I also feel that it's unfair to consider western games like South Park JRPGs because they are more character/story focused, when games like Baldur's Gate, Witcher, and 90's text-based games exist and were popular during their respective periods. It seems like a lot of people just associate choice/sandbox gameplay with WRPGs, even if they have the elements that make up JRPGs.   If that were the case, then games could be considered both JRPGs and WRPGs, which doesn't help categorization."
JRPG,3avnun,crazy_o,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:38:00 2015 UTC,"If that were the case, then games could be considered both JRPGs and WRPGs, which doesn't help categorization.   I see nothing wrong with this. There are games that blend FPS and RTS. There are strategy games with optional turn-based combat - so they could be both TBS and RTS. Does this negate the categories?  Simply ignore the name. We could call WRPGs ""exploration/world-driven player avatar simulators"" or JRPGs ""character/party driven abstract combat games"" or something, but we don't need to. It also lets the genres change and shift without needing to change the names. Years and years ago, ""FPS"" probably brought thoughts of keycards and inventory puzzles, healthpacks and hallways filled with strange monsters. But now, the very same term (just as useful) probably conjures up feelings of regenerating health, huge open fields with tons of human enemies, modern or post-modern war settings, etc."
JRPG,3avnun,pantsyman,2,Wed Jun 24 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"The only reason why this is an issue now is because games are now incorporating elements from other genres more than ever, all to get a delicious piece of that mass market pie that the game industry has exponentially inflated into. We diehard JRPG fans tend to draw a clear line between our favorite genre and everything else. It has always been like that, and it's optimal for our buying decisions. But games are games. Most JRPGS are clear JRPGS, but some games will inevitably fall under a weirder area that is JRPGS'sh.   The differences between JRPG and WRPG can be as minute as art style or specific mechanics such as turn-based vs. real-time or being able to choose name of protagonist, or it can be as broad as 'made in Japan.' Compare Fire Emblem to Xenogears to Kingdom Hearts to Brave Fencer Musashi. Which of these are jrpgs to you and which aren't?"
JRPG,3avnun,red_sutter,2,Wed Jun 24 07:06:21 2015 UTC,"Old topic but I'd like to answer anyway... for me it has almost everything to do with art style.   If I think about it, when showing a friend a game or reading comments on websites, people will describe an RPG - whatever elements it might have - as JRPG if it's in a distinct anime art style. Almost nobody other than the crowd that thinks ""made in Japan so it has to be a JRPG"" made comments on it for other games like Dark Souls for example. In the case of a distinct anime inspired art style the term JRPG will be commonly used by everyone independent from the gameplay.   That also opens another question that can be as confusing: what is the anime/manga art style? Like the Italian food example, it doesn't have to be made in Japan but it has to be recognized as inspired by that particular art style. A popular visual novel on Steam (Sakura Spirits) which is developed outside Japan would count in my opinion (not as JRPG, the art). Child of Light, in my opinion, would not count - yes the gameplay is there and they use cartoonish characters... but that's it for me, a cartoon. Now there are also a lot of different art directions in Japan, but like I said before, it has to jump at your face immediately making you think: this is a JRPG. CoL doesn't do that, for me at least.   TLDR: You should be able to determine if the game is a JRPG when you know it's a RPG and see some screenshots of it."
JRPG,3avnun,Jamaz,2,Sat Jun 27 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To me, I really love the anime style, and I'm not afraid to say that a lot of the time, I play JRPGs because it's like an anime game. Child of Light feels more like a fairy tale. I loved the game, but the different art style really makes it feel different (different sense of awe, tension, etc)"

JRPG,3avnun,Sighto,2,Wed Jun 24 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe I play too many SMT games, but I tend to associate moral choices more with JRPG these days. In a lot of recent WRPGs, the ""moral choice"" is ""am I a slaughtering lunatic, or a do-gooder saint?"""
JRPG,3avnun,SupaStaVince,2,Wed Jun 24 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think that it's more because it's hard to do a complicated morality system without:  A.) The protagonist being a psycho  B.) Life just absolutely wrecking the protagonist in almost unreasonable ways  When the morality systems works, it's fantastic. However, a lot of the time, the morality system boils down to ""do you believe in capital punishment?""  I'd say that gritty games, as a result, tend to be better for the morality system, as your gray choices are usually due toc circumstances. And, in general, grittiness is found more prevalently in WRPGs than in JRPGs. But even then, well-done systems are rare."
JRPG,3avnun,videogameboss,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, WRPGs tend to only have the polarized ""lawful good"" or ""chaotic evil"" choices, but that's because it's only Bioware or Bethesda making these games and taking that approach since they began. Outside of WRPGs, you have Telltale Games which does a decent job of moral (and not polar-opposite) decisions which don't always involve murdering some guy for fun.  JRPGs seem to have no choices offered at all though. It's rare just being offered different dialogue responses if any at all. Like all Final Fantasies, Kingdom Hearts, and the big titles that I'm aware of are pretty much a straight shot from beginning to end with sometimes optional bosses or landmarks to visit."
JRPG,3avnun,butterfly1763,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:00:48 2015 UTC,"Well, there's SMT as I mentioned. Also a couple of other things come to mind: Gungnir on PSP, and the Tactics Ogre series, as well.  But.. yeah I think really good moral decisions in games aren't necessarily as common as they could be. IMO Tales does a good job of at least presenting complicated moral decisions, even though it always has Deus Ex Machina let the player ignore it."
JRPG,3avnun,videogameboss,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"Would love to see a WRPG with deep moral choices, but no dev wants to put that much effort into content most people won't experience."

JRPG,3avnun,videogameboss,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"anyone who thinks there's a consistent difference between JRPGS and WRPGs other than their creators/country of origin is speaking out of ignorance and inexperience. the idea that you have to categorize each game into WRPG or JRPG in order to describe games to other people is retarded as hell. for example, if you say ""south park is a jrpg"" you could be immediately misleading people into thinking it's made by japanese, and you're saying nothing of value as the person could be wondering ""what jrpg is it like? final fantasy, dragon quest, etrian odyssey, tales of, etc.?"" instead you could say ""south park is like paper mario"" and convey so much more, so much more accurately in just one second more of typing."
JRPG,3avnun,mreiland,3,Wed Jun 24 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"the idea that you have to categorize each game into WRPG or JRPG in order to describe games to other people is retarded as hell   That's like saying that needing to categorize noodles into Thai and Italian in order to describe what kind of noodles they are is ""retarded as hell.""  As for the rest of your argument...  ""For example, if you say ""spaghetti is Italian"" you could be immediately misleading people into thinking it's made by Italians, and you're saying nothing of value as the person might be wondering ""what italian food is it like? pizza, lasagna, etc.?"" instead you could say ""spaghetti is noodles with marinara sauce"" and convey so much more in one more second.""  Do you see why your point makes no sense whatsoever? Nobody thinks Italian food is made exclusively in Italy by Italian people. Telling someone food is Italian won't confuse them. It's easier to just say ""Italian"" than to try and describe every individual Italian-style dish, right?   JRPG and WRPG are two entirely different genres, just like FPS and TPS are two entirely different genres. They both have tropes commonly attached to them, sometimes broken, and they both describe separate, unique game types.  I said it earlier in the thread, but the reason we call them WRPG and JRPG is not because of where they're made NOW, just like we don't call Italian and Thai food that because of where they're made NOW. We call them that because that's where that style was popularized. It's really that simple.   WRPGs were first popularized in the west, JRPGs were first popularized in Japan. You don't need to be western to make a WRPG, you don't need to be Japanese to make a JRPG.  Italian food was first popularized in Italy. Thai food was first popularized in Thailand. You don't need to be Italian to make Italian food, and you don't need to be Thai to make Thai food."

The only downside is that some of the later boss fights are reeaaaallly boring. The bosses have too much health and uninteresting patterns.

Your Video has made download Alundra again just to replay the greatness."
JRPG,3atu10,CobaltMonkey,4,Wed Jun 24 10:01:08 2015 UTC,"Fantastic game. Did a retro review for it a while back before it came out on PSN. I'll paste it here for anyone interested.   In honor of this game's impending release to PSN, I'm doing a retro review of the PS1 cult classic Alundra. What about this game has people coming back for more even a full 13 years after the initial release? How does it stack up against the giants in its genre? What makes it worth your time and money? Read on to find out.    Graphics and Sound:10 Each character is hand drawn very well, and all have a more detailed shoulder up portrait that appears next to their text box when they speak that fills in the detail that the character models in the earlier gen graphics couldn't convey. Each place in the world, be it dungeon or overworld, is rendered with just as much care. Too early for full voice acting, but they did make the effort everywhere possible to put in what character sound effects they could. Roars, screams, laughter, sobbing. All could have been simple written in, but Working Designs (the dev) went the extra mile and had them acted. Other effects are there too. If there's a leak in a roof, then you hear the drip. You hear the water pushed aside as you swim, and the crackle of torches as they burn. This isn't unique, but it is well done. The music fits the game like a glove. No area would be complete without its accompanying soundtrack. The music, sounds, and graphics work together in this game to create an absolutely perfect atmosphere. The one real complaint I have is that the end cinematic is a bit off. It's animated, unlike the rest of the game, and Alundra's hair is inexplicably red where it has been blonde. I can only think this change was made to distance him a bit from The Legend of Zelda's Link in Ocarina of Time to whom he bears a resemblance. Considering both games came out the same year, I'm guessing Working Designs was nearly done with their game when they caught an OoT trailer. lol   Story:9 The story in this game will keep you wondering about this or that from start to finish. Starting out with nothing but strange dreams to guide you to a foreign land, you soon meet with disaster. On arriving at the village of Inoa, you quickly learn that the place is beset by a plague of nightmares. Which wouldn't be so bad, except that these kind can kill you. As fate would have it, it turns out you're a Dreamwalker, someone with the power to enter the minds of others. Amazingly enough, this turns out to be very handy for making people not die. The rest of the game has you going in and out of people's disturbed minds, as well as trekking across the land around Inoa in an effort to discover and remove the cause of this plague. I promise you that all the answers you eventually get do not disappoint. It would be a perfect score, but there are a few uses of humor that detract from some more serious moments, and a few sudden reveals near the end of the game which could have been handled a bit better.    Characters:10 Every character has a unique personality to go along with their unique portrait, and it stays consistent from beginning to end, changing only where it makes sense to do so. The game's not afraid to use them to throw out a little humor here and there either. I recall one character stating, ""What did the gods take away our passion to create? Why do our very dreams try to consume us? Why don't we get basic cable here? Er... scratch that last one."" Bear in mind that this is a world of sword and sorcery. lol The characters fulfill every role required and do so beautifully, all the while offering humor, assistance, antagonism, or indifference where required. Top notch.  Gameplay: 9 Ah, the most important part of the game. And where the Zelda comparison continues. But it's not really OoT that this game is closest to, but its predecessor, LoZ: A Link to the Past. Alundra is what that game would be if you changed all the story and characters, and polished the gameplay until it shined even brighter. But what is it that makes it a great game? Well, it's got a 3D top down view which the designers took full advantage of. I'll include a couple screen shots to show you what I mean. Expect to see numerous perspective tricks. Monsters don't themselves pose much of a threat (Aside from Bosses, of course), and are really just there to break up the gameplay some, as well as add to your money stash. Not that the monsters are neglected in the game. They all have unique looks, with only a couple types resorting to pallet swaps for variety, and even then they change tactics a bit. You're given numerous weapons, tools, and magics throughout the game to use against these monsters, but just as often you'll be using them against the game's real threats...the puzzles. Portal be darned, but there are some tough ones in here! Okay, they're not quite as mind bending as Portal's stuff, but they will have you scratching your head for quite some time, and do force you to think outside the norm on many occasions. Its Zelda cousins don't even come close. Solving these requires careful thought, precise timing, persistence, and a good deal of platforming skill. And it's not just in dungeons and dreams that you'll find these. The overworld itself is filled with them. You'll want to revisit some areas of it when you get new tools, but not too often at first since many rewards require multiple things to be accessed. Wandering the world in search of more Gilded Falcons or Life Vessels is as much fun as any dungeon. So, what's keeping it from a perfect 10? A bit of a pacing problem with when and how new weapons are acquired, as well as a couple that just feel extraneous. The bow in particular is so weak that I can't see it being used outside of the few puzzles it's needed for.    Overall Score: 9.5 I believe we've answered those questions from the beginning paragraph up there. What keeps people coming back, and why is it worth your time and money? Strong gameplay, enjoyable story, and endearing characters. How does it measure up to its genre's giants? It can stand level with them and look them square in the eye."

JRPG,3atu10,CobaltMonkey,2,Tue Jun 23 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help you find a good game. :) But make no mistake, the game that is for some reason entitled ""Alundra 2"" is pretty much nothing like Alundra. For starters, Alundra is the name of the protagonist of this game. There is no Alundra in Alundra 2. In fact, the name and the existence of puzzles are the only things the games have in common. Who in blazes thought it would be a good idea to steal that game's name and slap it on a completely unrelated title? Bah. I could rant all day.

Otherwise it's an amazingly fun ride with a top notch soundtrack, fun zelda-esque combat, tough as nails puzzles and memorable characters. Also, who could forget the classic '90s anime intro."
JRPG,3atze3,Lysand,8,Tue Jun 23 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"It's long been one of my favorite series, and one that I hope will get revived, if not main series (as 6 looks to be its own goofy thing) spiritually, via Kickstarter or anything else.  I just want a JRPG where I hulk out into a dragon and lay waste to my enemies, is that so much to ask?"
JRPG,3atze3,Moondogtk,2,Tue Jun 23 14:46:14 2015 UTC,Three is good for that. I just wish they would do a real throwback to some of the older games. Would it compete with FF-VII remake no. But I think given time it might garner sales worth the projects time.
JRPG,3atze3,IronAchillesz,2,Wed Jun 24 06:51:53 2015 UTC,"The best thing I can say about Dragon Quarter is that it makes dragon mode a major 'No, Fuck YOU' button. Absolute destruction!  But yeah; I'd love to see them come back to the series."
JRPG,3atze3,Moondogtk,5,Wed Jun 24 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Sara vs Jade you mean?  I think his name was Jade...    Anyways yeah that was pretty cool.  I love BoF 1.  One of my classic favs.  There are also a few ways to exploit the original SNES version.  The first of course is to hang out around go in and out of the start town until a White Deer shows up.  then use a Marble to avoid battles, and go capture it.  The antlers sell for 1000 IIRC.  A couple of those lets you buy the best items from the shop in the occupied town.    Then when you have Bo if you go west from the messed up town (northwest of Wyndia), and keep going west to the well.  Here you can suicide battle some madly OP monsters.  If you manage to kill them you can get mad EXP.  Then when you are strong enough you can use the western cliff to capture a boar/deer(make sure you do it by trapping it, not by shooting).  Then when it blows up walk onto it's tile, under the meat/antler while it is still airborn.  If you did it properly you can now move west again, up the cliff.  This lets you access two towns and a bunch of new OP monsters (do NOT ENTER THE HOLE IN THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WASTELAND.  This will crash your game, and possibly corrupt your save file because a cutscene is supposed to trigger when you enter but it doesn't work until a certain point in the game)."
JRPG,3atze3,Zilveari,2,Tue Jun 23 16:30:21 2015 UTC,Dude thanks for this. I've been thinking about playing the original and this'll be super helpful.
JRPG,3atze3,Mykath,3,Tue Jun 23 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but be careful with the second one.  It is a definite exploit, and I probably haven't found all of the ways to break the game with it.  The main thing is just not going into that hole in the ground though."
JRPG,3atze3,Zilveari,0,Tue Jun 23 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't run from battles, you should be at a good level for most of the game, and if you've been smart with your money good with gear.   Actually,  gear is really not an issue. The top of the line stuff in shops is vastly inferior to the stuff you find in caves, so shopping will mainly just cover gaps in your team"
JRPG,3atze3,darkdrgon2136,5,Thu Jun 25 05:25:32 2015 UTC,A wonderful series with intriguing stories and exceptional music.  I take it you haven't played the other games yet? I'm excited for your journey through the series. It's going to have a meaningful impact on you.
JRPG,3atze3,H_Floyd,3,Tue Jun 23 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"so funny that you said almost my exact comment. Breath of Fire was a great series for me to being my adventure into JRPG's as a kid. Simple yet engrossing story, music that made me hum all throughout school, and bringing my love of dragons to life. I hope that this series touches more people and we get something better than....BOF6"
JRPG,3avioc,NellieFunke,14,Tue Jun 23 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on what they change the battle system TO that matters.  As long as they keep some semblance of the materia system and the battle system is fun, I'm on board."
JRPG,3avioc,Nomanorus,2,Tue Jun 23 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"This! If it suddenly gets changed to lets say half Xenoblade with its 10million menus and its overly complex system, crossed with final fantasy tactics typed turn based, then I don't think I can get behind that, however if its like FFX or FFXIII I'm fine with it, not as happy if it went the FFXV route, I like it in its own game, not sure it'd work for FVII."
JRPG,3avioc,Dan_Tsukasa,10,Wed Jun 24 09:05:33 2015 UTC,"I cared more about the story than I did the battle system.  If they leave the battle system, that's fine.  If they change it to something else, I'm ok with that too."

JRPG,3avioc,Mykath,3,Fri Jun 26 14:44:37 2015 UTC,Yeah the silly stuff of FFVII is what made it for me.
JRPG,3avioc,Evrae_Altana,19,Tue Jun 23 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"I can't understand resentment toward this remake just yet. If you enjoyed FFVII and don't want it changed, there's good news: It isn't going anywhere. I was never desperate for a revision because the original holds up stupendously to this day. I also never feared a remake because I would always have the original. You lose nothing, just go back to you PSX.  Think of the remake as a new interpretation. The market is different and this isn't a charity as much as it may sound like one. We are getting a modern take on a familiar story. For a fan like me, that's a bonus. It's more FFVII but from different angles."
JRPG,3avioc,LocalsingleDota,2,Tue Jun 23 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose there would be feelings of miss opportunity if they changed the battle system to something of modern FF game, which wouldn't have the spirit of the original.   I would rather see the remake enhance everything. Companies are still making really fun/great turn based RPGS(persona games), so I would prefer them to not scrap it."
JRPG,3avioc,mysticrudnin,2,Tue Jun 23 21:46:07 2015 UTC,It would still need to be significantly remade to be a fun turn-based RPG.
JRPG,3avioc,arvzg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a lot like the Star Wars thing right? So many people consider Star Wars 'Dead' to them because of Episode 1/2/3, and yet the Originals (4/5/6) didn't go anywhere.   I can understand to a degree though, if you remember something so dearly, so fondly, and that memory is trounced around by this 'REMAKE' that's supposed to be better - and it's not - that would really ruin my memory of the original."
JRPG,3avioc,You_Got_The_Touch,3,Wed Jun 24 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'll play it regardless.  I might not like the game as much as the old version if they mess too much with things, but I really want to see what they do with it."

JRPG,3avioc,fanboy_killer,5,Fri Jun 26 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"If they remove the ATB system, I won't even consider buying it and it's my favorite game of all time.

JRPG,3avioc,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:46:37 2015 UTC,It would too expensive and time consuming to implement two core battle systems.
JRPG,3avioc,fanboy_killer,2,Tue Jun 23 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, they should stick to the ATB system since that core base means guaranteed sales."
JRPG,3avioc,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:33:01 2015 UTC,"They want to appeal to people that haven't played the game as well. Honestly ATB might not be the best approach from a business standpoint. It's not (and should not be) just a higher polygon count mod. The FF7 fans are way too dogmatic on this generally speaking. I'll buy the game no matter what. But if if I had my way, it would play a lot like XV. Which, in case you haven't gotten to play the demo, is freakin awesome."
JRPG,3avioc,fanboy_killer,0,Fri Jun 26 09:44:19 2015 UTC,"Dropping the ATB system would alienate fand of the original game, myself included. Fans of the original game are guaranteed sales and the actual people begging for this remake for ages. I ahven't played the demo but the combat looks like Kingdom Hearts and Crisis Core, two games with combat system which I hated."
JRPG,3avioc,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:50:28 2015 UTC,"Nomura said change is a coming. That alone is enough to alienate the fans because they're so dogmatic. They don't even know the extent of what that means and they're already bitching. They should not just make the same exact game with really pretty graphics. I think if people actually got that, they'd realize they actually wanted more. The overworld will be seamlessly integrated I'm sure, and populated with enemies instead of looking barren. They want make something creative and fresh that appeals to old and newcomers alike. But to most of the old players that doesn't matter. They just want to condemn the thing before it's even released purely due to rise tinted nostalgia glasses. The only thing that could really ruin this game is the ravenous, dogmatic, and bull headed fan base that can't accept the idea of the slightest deviation. Good news. They'll have the PC port to play on PS4 or they can just mod the PC version. Like Nomura said. It would make no sense to have 2 FFVII games on PS4 with the only difference being graphics. Let them have room to breath."
JRPG,3avioc,fanboy_killer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:12:59 2015 UTC,"Those changes are more than welme, no doubt abou it, but changing an integral aprt of the experience like the ATB system is not a great move. This is my favorite game of all time but without that, I won't even consider buying the remake since combat was one of the funnest things to do in FF VII."
JRPG,3avioc,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:54:24 2015 UTC,"OK man, don't buy it. Plenty of other people will. And it is going to be different in terms of combat to some degree. How big that is is not yet known. If you can not tolerate any changes to combat go ahead and resign yourself not to buy it. It'll still succeed financially on its reputation alone. The funny thing is that the trailer pretty much specifically mentions the ""fear it may bring"" (overly zealous dogmatic fans) I prefer to be the guy who feels joy and as it said, ""embrace whatever may come""."
JRPG,3avioc,fanboy_killer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:56:46 2015 UTC,"I get it, you're trying to attack me with the over  zealous dogmatic BS but it's not working. It ahs nothing to do with that, beleive me. I more than welcome changes to the franchise, I just don't think ditching one of the thing sthat made the original so good is a good move. I especially ""condemn"" the move because I dislike Kingdom Hearts and didn't enjoy the combat in Crisis Core. I'd rather think of a stategy instead of mashing buttons and casting spells every now and then. It's a personal preference and good for you if you like that kind of thing."
JRPG,3avioc,AtticusWeiss,0,Fri Jun 26 11:10:34 2015 UTC,"Despite the fact that there is a strategy to Crisis Core, I really don't care. You probably won't buy FFVII. I probably will. I'm fine with it. You probably won't be."
JRPG,3avioc,linkfx2008,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:16:09 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing man, things need to change to improve. I want them to change the combat cause you can completely break it and the game doesnt provide a challenge anymore. You can make your character so op its not funny. The AtB is severly outdated they need to mix it up give its ten style of battle system with sevens conditonal battle system."
JRPG,3avioc,fanboy_killer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:43:23 2015 UTC,I understand you feel that way but doing that would be a huge backlash on fans of the original. Imagine yourself sitting at a meeting at SE's headquarters and the subject was ebing voted. Would you actually vote to change such a substantial change of the best selling game the company ever had?
JRPG,3avioc,linkfx2008,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:49:31 2015 UTC,"One thing they I repeat they are going to have to change and revamp is the combat. Turned based combat doesnt sell well any more. People like being in control more then ever. I would vote to change the combat. Red 13 he was useless end game. His limits were hardly worth earning. Everything was done haphazardly in terms of limits. I want them to revamp them and make them better. The turned based combat is ancient now a days. Its not going to be an action rpg thats one thing I do know they wont stray too far from their roots for this game. The whole system behind it needs a overhaul, materia is completely broken. It makes the end game way to fucking easy if you take the time to perfect everything in 7. I honestly accept any changes they make for the better. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE SAME GAME THEN PLAY THE ORIGINAL Nomura has even stated this. They are going to improve this game for the best cause it has people working from the original seven on this one."
JRPG,3avioc,fly2me,5,Tue Jun 30 11:52:13 2015 UTC,"My thought is, see what they come out with. If you like it, buy. If you don't, don't buy it. It's simple as that.  This is a remake. If they wanted to give us the same game with better graphics it would be a Remaster. The Japanese culture and work ethic is insane. I'm guessing most employees are dedicated to producing a good product. Please look forward to it."
JRPG,3avioc,H_Floyd,2,Tue Jun 30 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The battle system will certainly be altered, we just don't know the extent. Maybe director Nomura will pleasantly surprise us and keep ATB mostly intact (but make it look ""flashy""--his singular mission in life since the release of Advent Children). But given XV's production, I would not at all be surprised to see a Cloud-only action RPG set entirely within the boundaries of Midgar.  EDIT: Nomura says “I can’t share details, but we’re changing it to a more realistic system.” Read more at http://gematsu.com/2015/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-wont-have-new-characters#Z9IvugliskvHzHf3.99  There you go. It'll be an action game."
JRPG,3avioc,WFSGreatOne,3,Tue Jun 23 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"If it's an action system I won't buy it.   I physically would be unable to play it.   10 years of waiting, for naught."
JRPG,3avioc,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Tue Jun 23 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"Realistic doesn't mean action.  FFX is more realistic in the way its combat works than FFVII, FFXIII is dramatically more realistic than FFVII.  Standing oposite sides for 5 minutes between moves is much less realistic and flow breaking than the more dynamic system that was XII-2 (very improved from XIII btw)."
JRPG,3avioc,arvzg,2,Wed Jun 24 00:03:44 2015 UTC,I actually would not mind at all if they rework the battle system (AS LONG AS IT'S GOOD) - after watching Advent Children I've long dreamed of a game that can match the sheer awesomeness of its battle sequences.  I imagine if they do rework the battle system that it would feel/look like Dissidia's battle system (which was awesome)
JRPG,3avioc,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Wed Jun 24 09:07:46 2015 UTC,"The older FF games get to keep their battle systems, sluggish or not, because they're aimed at JRPG fans, they're for handheld (DS/3DS mainly), they're not looking to make the largest amount of money.  FFVII remake is a high point in this console generation, they're looking to do what FF used to do, bring in new and old fans, do they care if they lose 50 old fans but bring in 800 new ones? Of course not.  Spending an insane amount of money on something but keeping the battle system the same has a huge chance of ruining it, there are plenty of JRPG and even non-JRPG fans who've grown tired of turn based combat and want something else, the number of people who love turn base (myself here) is a minority, however loud some of them are, it is a minority.  Fact is it'd be a terrible choice to market your huge 200 million dollar game to a minority of players, alienating almost everyone else, it just simply wouldn't sell.  People might love to rant about how things change, but people overlook the simple obvious business decisions behind it. You can take chances with a small cheap game (bravely default, which i love) but you can't be to risky with such a huge one."
JRPG,3avioc,AKABoondock,2,Wed Jun 24 05:37:36 2015 UTC,"Frankly, if you were a huge FF7 fan and JRPG lover, I dont see how you DONT play this no matter the circumstances. Of course I want turn based, but if it isnt, I will still play the absolute shit out of it. Probably several times."
JRPG,3avioc,AtticusWeiss,2,Wed Jun 24 09:02:53 2015 UTC,"This is the problem with the FF7 fans. Jesus. Condemn a game that you've never touched, nevered tried....

Get a grip."
JRPG,3avioc,happy_pants_man,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"FFIV gets to keep its battle system because it's a much smaller game (both in size and scope), isn't getting a monumental graphics upheaval for a current gen console, and either portable systems lend themselves better to slower combat or we're just more tolerant of that battle system on there.  And this game did change everything, so I'd be very upset if the only impact its remake could leave is that it was ""just another"" remake."
JRPG,3avioc,anjinash,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:36:10 2015 UTC,"As long as it's turn based in nature, I don't mind if they update the battle system/UI. One of the reasons I still love and play older FF games is because I don't like twitch-reflex gaming with little story - I like making considered decisions, taking my time to get it right, and having a good story hook me into WANTING to master the battle system.  If they were to use another FF as a starting point for the battle system for the remake, I'd love it if they too the FFX system where any character can switch in and out of a battle.  If it's more like XII or XIII, I'll be severely disappointed."
JRPG,3avioc,pantsyman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"It's a modern SE game so i fully expect an ""action"" combat system where i control 1 char only and mostly press 1 button and everything else including the party is automated."
JRPG,3avioc,Maxis47,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty confident the only significant gameplay change is outside combat.  Remember that much of the game is crude 3D models traversing prerendered static backdrops.  Ideally they'll be fully realizing those backdrops in 3D as well, which would necessitate a complete change in how you explore the world."
JRPG,3avioc,Jamaz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:11:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure if all they changed was the battle system and the game got resounding reviews from critics and the playerbase, everyone on strike would break down and play this game anyway."

But honestly I'm going to play it no matter what they do. A lot of changes or no changes, doesn't matter to me. This is a huge thing, remaking a game this old. I'd like to see how their previous design decisions and modern sensibilities clash.  My personal preference? Use FFX's battle system and add in a fuck-ton of materia, and new materia types. Make materia combinations actually matter. Give characters slight preferences towards certain types of materia. Materia subtypes? More notable growth from materia? More interesting levels of materia (more than just oh the fire one has Fire - Fire 2 - Fire 3)  I think ATB kinda sucks. A lot. It's okay in FFVIII, and FFV is so good that I can excuse it, but otherwise I'd rather just not see it. If they do use it, I hope it gets the best parts of VIII and X-2, and I hope that in general it works and isn't laughably slow."

JRPG,3artg2,Jamaz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:40:03 2015 UTC,"The other thing is to know your target audience. I think the majority of JRPGs fall flat because they're afraid sales will suffer if they don't follow a strict coming-of-age character trope to reach the widest audience. If your game is non-commercial, you have the option of getting your vision out without making concessions."
JRPG,3artg2,Jamaz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"That might be a fair point, which games do you think handle this best? I know not all characters are in their teens, FFX had a good variety of ages, but other than that I can't think of one that springs to mind!"
JRPG,3artg2,Soverance,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's your story, so make the characters you've always wanted. I just feel the generic-young-male-brash-protagonist is the staple for jrpgs that want to guarantee financial return. Don't do this just because you feel you have to copy existing jrpgs - there's so many more choices at your disposal.  Just name any game where the main character is instantly identifiable and memorable over all other characters - that's a strong main character. This is just my opinion, but characters like Squall, Tidus, and Chrono are almost never brought up in discussions of the games they're in; and it's because they have no personality and were just bland player-inserts. The only games where player-inserts work well tend to be WRPGs which offer thousands of lines of choices to build that absent personality.   I personally loved FF6's characters, and the two main characters were women who weren't even vehicles for the player. They were just such well-developed characters that you wanted to hear their story. FF7, while not the best example but most popular, also had Cloud who already had a fucked up past and his own emo personality and preferences - most players do not associate themselves as Cloud while playing the game - he stands out as his own character. And to name a couple of characters I like from other genres: Kratos from God of War, Joel and Ellie from Last of Us, Solid Snake, and Kerrigan/Samus (pre 2000 before their characters were butchered -_-;)"
JRPG,3artg2,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"FF6 simply had too many characters, in my opinion. Fourteen of them, was it? No need for so many."
JRPG,3artg2,HaploPaithan,12,Fri Jun 26 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"Good story. Combat that involves more than just damage (buffs and debuffs must be available, and they must make up for losing one turn of damage) The ability to get through the game (not necessarily easily) by only fighting the encounters in the path through the story, i.e. no grinding or relying on levels from optional areas. quick but flashy/satisfying combat. Don't let it take forever, but also don't have it just look like DQ1 or FF1. give flashy animations, make combat feel good. If it feels great, that will make up for being a bit slower than scrolling text. But speaking of scrolling text, allow the player to speed through that. Don't be like DQ9 where you can't do anything to speed up a battle even after the spell animations have finished. Optional content. Please please please include something meaningful to do apart from the main story. Dragons.. Have a dragon, because dragons are cool."
JRPG,3artg2,Sonicjms,2,Tue Jun 23 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"Great checklist, and I would agree with all points after reading! So lets see...   I think I have a solid story, expressing it will be challenging but I think my characters can help. 100% yes, there needs to be some strategy to these games, otherwise they can be pretty boring. I love Nocturne for this reason! I don't love Nocturne for this reason! Ok it's not so bad there, but definitely something I don't like to see, especially if I want to progress the story! Persona 3 and 4. Just so satisfying. And agreed, I often set Pokemon games to skip the battle animations out of sheer fatigue of seeing them constantly. Lots and lots of... Fetch Quests!!.....

JRPG,3artg2,endlessrepeat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not sure of a JRPG specifically that does side content really well. In my mind, FF4 does it pretty well, but I'm not sure if I could call what it does the ""best"", as I haven't really seen enough to make that judgement. Outside of JRPGs, though, I feel that Zelda is the king of doing side content, with items, capacity upgrades, dungeons, and more being available to the player outside of the main quest. If you have an item based magic system, you could have various cool spells hidden in corners of the map the player isn't scripted to visit. You can follow DQ9's example of making crawling through extra dungeons it's own little micro-game where you not only complete the dungeons, but also collect the locations. These don't all necessarily have to have some amazing reward at the end, as sometimes the dungeon itself is the reward. Hope that helps."

JRPG,3artg2,kingdom18,2,Tue Jun 23 00:38:32 2015 UTC,"You should try and play some older JRPGs to see how you feel they hold up. Just a couple hours of some of the classics might do, but try different franchises. Specially the FF games. I've replayed some of them and noticed that I had a really hard time getting into the game as much as I did when I was kid because of the battles.   For example, I now despise Random Battles since it takes a good chunk of time to load into the battle map. 5-10 seconds might not look that long in the grand scope of things, but battles are really frequent and those seconds easily amount to minutes and eventually hours just staring at the transition screen. The PS FF games are particularly painful for me (which is sad since I really like the games) and I just can't play them for too long before I turn it off out of sheer frustration and boredom when I trigger a new battle. One of the reasons I still enjoy Chrono Trigger is because I can easily skip battles by running through the monsters, and when I get into one everything is set up rapidly (no pointless camera close up or panning to show the monsters, no entry animations, etc).  And the animations play a huge role in how a battle feels. Now that I'm older I've noticed that there's a lot of downtime from selecting and option up until it is completed and a new one starts. Something that speeds up the process to minimize that downtime is pretty much mandatory in modern JRPGs in my opinion, and there's a lot of tricks that you can do to accomplish that.    Make animations ""have a punch"", so there's still a visual feedback of a hit connecting and that feels satisfying. Bland animations that mostly result in changing numbers are boring and give a feel that battles are dull, and it gives you an easier time when making them (since I assume this is something like a one-man project). A trick that a lot of modern beat 'em ups use nowadays, like Bayonneta and Devil May Cry, is to focus on the animation hitting the enemy instead of wind-up or recovery, making sure that the action happens rapidly and you can move on to the next one as fast as possible, while the player can register the hit going through. This is specially important when using skills like magic and such. You know about the common trope of JRPGs that says that 99% of the time players just smash the attack command to get those battles over quickly? That's because in most JRPGs the ""Attack"" command has almost no downtime, while casting a spell/skill usually involves additional animations. This usually end up in people getting bored of random fights, since they end up mashing one button to end it quickly.  If you're going for a more traditional battle turn system, have a way to indicate when a fight is coming up. Random Encounters where you're happily walking through a place and seeing a sudden transition screen to a battle without not knowing that it was coming are a thing of the past that hasn't aged well at all. It's something that is completely out of the player's control and gets annoying really quickly when sometimes you just want to keep moving forward with the game. Having the monsters on the field gives the player plenty of time to ""prepare"" for a battle and it puts him in the mindset that one is coming, and gives him the chance to avoid it completely if he outruns it. It doesn't really has to be literally a monster, but some kind of indicator works fine. For example, in the Persona series you see one Shadow on the map, but if you battle it the enemy can be 3 giant metal knights. The point is to give the player a chance to see when a battle is coming so it doesn't feels like the game is randomly throwing stuff at you and instead gives him something to focus on so it doesn't feel as cheap.  While we're at it, if you're having transitions to battle maps, make them happen fast. There's nothing more annoying that getting caught in a battle that you didn't want to AND taking several seconds until you can finally input controls. FF VIII and IX are particularly bad at this; every time a random battle happens there's the transition screen, then the camera circles around to show you the monsters you're fighting while the characters swing their weapons around, then it focus on the party AND THEN you can finally smash ""X"" to start attacking. Random Battles, whether you see the monsters on the screen or not, are a staple of the genre and good, but make sure to minimize the amount of time a player isn't in control of the characters.   You don't need systems like the Tales or FF XIII series to make a battle fast paced. The trick is to make sure that a player is doing stuff as often as possible, showing just the necessary ""fluff"" when using skills so it happens fast and registers satisfactorily in your mind and being able to move to the next one.   A good example of a traditional turn based JRPG that has a fast paced battle system is Persona 4. There's little downtime between selecting a skill and it going through: The character summons the Persona, and it shows up WHILE doing the attack animation. It's a very minor detail that really helps to speed up the battles and not make them seem stale, instead of other classic games where each skill you use requires the character setting up, then do the attack, the attack hitting and moving the character to the neutral position.   Anyway, this ended up really long but I hope it helped you somehow."

JRPG,3artg2,Jamaz,3,Tue Jun 23 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like one of the things that separates good JRPGS from amazing ones is a great soundtrack. It's what makes it the most memorable. Take a look at the Final Fantasies, one of the things they all share are incredible soundtracks.  I mean you still need the elements to make it a good JRPG, but to make it to that next level you need the music. Personally this is has always been my draw to the genre over others."

JRPG,3artg2,Redheadkitten,2,Tue Jun 23 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with so many of you, but one thing I wanted to add is this:    Character progression   This relates to Party Members and their progression as people through side stories/or the main story, and also combat.  I love it when I'm playing a JRPG and the characters, while still resemble themselves from the beginning by the end game, have some sort of major development that makes you view them in a different light.    Now when I mean progression in terms of combat, I mean the steady building of your party members' prowess in battle.  I like it to be continuous from the beginning of the game till the end (and beyond)  I hate it when its barely endgame and I have most skills/artes/abilities aside from a spare few that are gained via side quests.   Also on a side note, more options in battle the better, don't limit me to a few moves and tactics."

JRPG,3artg2,Ozwaldo,2,Tue Jun 23 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"For me the main three things are likable/relatable main characters and interesting antagonists/side characters, a good interesting story, and stuff to do that isn't part of the main story line.

JRPG,3artg2,diclonius217,2,Tue Jun 23 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"Strategy! Most people have brought up the story telling, so the next most important part to me is the combat. Games quickly become stale if every boss fight unfolds the same way. Giving extreme customization to your party and making every boss fight change up your approach are what really sell me on a games battle system. Bravely Default and Final Fantasy X are great games to look at for this. They have frequent boss fights and all of them give a unique feel. Very rarely you feel like you can just auto to victory. (Unless you set up your team just for that)"
JRPG,3artg2,eob3257,2,Tue Jun 23 03:14:30 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing for you to do is to make sure that your themes and your mechanics are in harmony.  FAR too many JRPG games are just dungeon crawlers with cutscenes and the two have nothing to do with one another.  Consider Xenosaga.  Those games had great narrative ambitions.  They wanted to genuinely reflect humanity through their party of characters who all had a different perspective on it.  But the combat changed in every game.  It had nothing to do with the game that hosted it.  The combat system could have been anything.  Now consider Xenoblade.  Xenoblade had a much much simpler and more cliche narrative, but it communicated that narrative through mechanics.  Power of friendship? Check.  That's baked into the affinity system and the combat.  The power to decide one's own destiny?  Check.  Shulk's ability to do that is the most unique and powerful ability in the game.  Don't be like Xenosaga.  Be like Xenoblade.  Decide what your game is about and make both a story and a combat system that communicate those themes."
JRPG,3artg2,RevRay,2,Tue Jun 23 07:11:13 2015 UTC,"Something JRPGs tend to lack is the impact of choice. Back in the day, chioces were offered to the player, and if you chose a dialogue option not in line with the plot, it would just call you a coward and keep giving the same options until you said yes. Nowdays, JRPGs tend not to give you choices at all.  A truly good JRPG will present difficult choices and branching paths as a result. It's expensive and takes a lot of time to implement, but that's what makes it closer to perfect for me."

JRPG,3artg2,H_Floyd,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"The route that most games tend to go is ""illusion of choice"". If you've ever played Telltale Walking Dead games, they utilize this strategy. You offer many choices that have their own dialogue response and maybe a short event/reaction, but overall, they don't affect the plot. That way, you put some effort into creating the decision and outcomes, but don't go overboard as in ""I choose to be an evil warlord"" or ""I choose to abandon the quest and make pots"". This works because the game still offers some choices that have major divergent outcomes, just not more than two or three unless you've got the manpower to produce them."
JRPG,3artg2,Orthonox,2,Tue Jun 23 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"The two most important elements for me are the storytelling and the combat system since in most of JRPGs I spend my time watching how the story progresses by cutscenes or by dialog and of course battleing to raise my stats.   So a good JRPG must have a compelling story with out being the stereotypical anime-like story the Japs love to repeat so much and the combat system must be entretaining and complex enought to not make the grindding boring, regardless of how it works if the combat system is well balanced the game won't become tedious or too easy.   Outsied of those two, a good RPG must have replayability value which translates in extra missions, side quest, secret bosses all that stuff and also like the story the art style must be creative or the most it can be, I know we live under the tolkien influence but still try to desing your characters and your creatures creatively, with that the game wins a lot of personality.   Good luck OP."

JRPG,3artg2,amuller72,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the bases have been covered, so I'll put in a vote for music.  Music is extremely important in an RPG. Experiences in story-based games are imprinted permanently with accompanying music. It serves a unique function that connects immediate experience to memory, eternally.  Of course, it has to be good. That's difficult to quantify, but we can approximate. Music should do something; music that's ""just there"" serving as atmosphere does enhance the mood, but its function ends there--you'll forget it quickly. It has no permanence. I believe music should approach the center stage equally with art and story. It should set a mood, be memorable, be unique, be developmental, be full of the composer's personality. It should not be merely atmospheric, ambient, flat, thinly-arranged, static, or generic. Perhaps this type of music thrives in particular genres, but not the RPG. Maybe a track here or there, but an RPG full of it will have no aural anchor like the best RPGs do. Games like Chrono Cross, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Final Fantasy 6--they're keenly remembered for many things, but if you've played them, you know the music and how it affected you. Yes, not just improved the gameplay experience, but genuinely did something to you, occupied a visceral presence inside of you. That's the kind of music that makes great RPGs.  (Let me know if you want that sort of thing for your game. I'd be happy to compose the right kind of music for you... perhaps we could trade art assets or something.)"

JRPG,3apuir,Rickster747,3,Mon Jun 22 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"Generally it would be trademarked in all regions separately, but the trademarks will be filed and accepted at different times due to different administrative procedures.   The implication is that Namco are preparing to localize it - in recent years Tales has been pretty safe for that, but I think a lot of us still remember the Dark Ages of 2008-2012 where Namco seemed to have totally given up on the series in the West, and this kind of thing is a nice reassurance that the game will come out in English."

JRPG,3arlzv,heart-station,7,Mon Jun 22 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"I like both kinds, but I prefer party-focused stories like the Persona games over strictly player-focused since games like Xenoblade tend to feel a bit flat if only the main character is well-developed. My favorites, though, tend to be the protagonist-focused stories that also have arcs for all of the characters. I think that kind of story tends to be the strongest because the main character's development will parallel the themes of the game and giving one character a larger portion of the focus will make that character, the themes, and the story as a whole stronger. Good examples of this include Tales of the Abyss, Nier, The World Ends With You, and Drakengard 3. This is also why I don't really like having silent or bland protagonists. These games can still have great stories, but a real protagonist would make them stronger. The choices that games like these offer (like Persona) do often add depth to the story, but you can still have choices even if the protagonist is voiced, like Nier, Ar Tonelico, and countless visual novels do. But I guess self-inserting/roleplaying is more about fun than good storytelling.  One thing I'm unsure of is how a game like Soul Sacrifice fits into this since I loved its story but one of the main characters is an NPC even though you do play from his perspective. I suppose it's party-focused but since you see all of the characters in memory/flashback sequences they're not really part of the party. The silent protagonist is just an observer and doesn't actually interact with the ""party"" until the ending of the game."
JRPG,3arlzv,Timewinders,5,Tue Jun 23 02:48:25 2015 UTC,"I very much prefer when the story is centered around the player character, what's fun about playing as someone who's just ""there""? Then again, it depends on the game. However though, one of the best examples I can give of a story that barely involves the player character is FFXII. Like, honestly, Vaan is just not a great main character in my opinion. I never felt like he actually did anything, he just happened to be there when important events were happening. I could never fully get into XII's story because of this."
JRPG,3arlzv,Artanyas,7,Mon Jun 22 23:25:31 2015 UTC,"Actually he was pretty critical to the story. Hold on a sec:  Okay found it.    FFXII has a clear villain: Ashe. FFXII plays like a start of darkness prequel with a twist ending. What would have happened if Ashe had listened to the Occurias? She would have wiped Archadia from the map and then could have become a witch-empress with a pact with the devil; exactly the kind of Big Bad you encounter in classic fantasy RPGs.   Then there is the role of Vaan in the story. He is usually treated as a tagalong kid not relevant to the grand scheme of things, but during the first appearance of Rasler's ""ghost"", Vaan also sees a ghost, but believes that it's Reks'. Since we know that the ghost is a tool used by the Occuria to manipulate Ashe, we can only assume that Vaan is seen by the same Occurias as a ""plan B"", another proxy who could do their dirty work if Ashe failed. Later Ashe keeps seeing her husband's ghost but Vaan stops seeing Reks', which would mean that he has already shook off the Occuria's influence. Vaan (before his Character Derailment in later games) becomes a more virtuous role model for Ashe: he has as many reasons as her to hate The Empire, but he gives up his desires of revenge, is ready to forgive Archadia, and even becomes friends with the brother of the man responsible for Reks' death, showing Ashe that there are other paths than mindless revenge and convincing her to not become the Big Bad she would have been otherwise. This shows the quality of the writing: Vaan, who was essentially a last minute addition decided by the executives of the company was incorporated in the story with a subtle but vital role: he actually manages to defeat the Big Bad by stopping her before she becomes evil. How many RPG heroes can claim such a feat?   Equally, the Occuria may have realised this fact about Vaan, which may have been what prompted them to send him images of Reks. Keep in mind that he and Ashe weren't the only ones hurt by the Empire. The Occuria might have sent him images to keep him from thinking clearly. Arguably, they may have been able to project images towards anyone who felt strongly enough against the Empire. Regardless, I agree that Vaan's presence certainly influenced Ashe by the end - remember how he refuses to kill Gabranth in retribution for Reks?"
JRPG,3arlzv,Macon1234,2,Mon Jun 22 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"Vaan is what I would consider a point of view protagonist while Ashe Basch and Baltheir are the main story driving characters.

JRPG,3arlzv,Electrium,3,Tue Jun 23 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"I think the best RPGs can't simply be one or the other. They have a cast of characters that you care about, in a world that you care about (think Xenoblade, Chrono Trigger), with a goal that you care about (think FFX).  There are quite a few games that don't really fit this mold. FF7 actually is not about the hero or the party. Sephiroth is the one that guides the story from moment to moment. And in FF9, it's technically a story about Garnet, but it's each individual's moments on their own that make the game special. And in Earthbound, it really has very little to do with the individuals and everything to do with the story themes. Xenosaga takes the Lost approach and has several main characters each taking turns in the spotlight. Those are just a few examples but you probably get the idea.  Thinking with the limitation that you have to either have a great party or a great hero, I would say a party is more important. That way you can use the struggles of multiple characters to emphasize your overall point. In stories that are dedicated to a hero (Sword Art Online not exactly on topic but its a perfect example),  interesting ideas and relationships often must be thrown out so that your hero can look like a hero more than everyone else."

Shulk is the lynchpin of Xenoblade which is the most inferior Xeno but w/e, FFVII is the story of Cloud. Chrono was wholly meaningless in CT. I'm saying, be reductive."
JRPG,3arlzv,Sighto,2,Tue Jun 23 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"I feel games that focus on the main character and try to make that character act as an insert for the player end up bland. These characters are almost always universally generic with no personality aside from ""I always do the right thing"". It's usually male, produces a harem, makes stupid decisions that always work, and is gratuitously overpowered.  I feel the best storyline and characters are the ones where the MC is so different from you that you respect them rather than identify as them. They're just so awesome, endearing, and memorable that you want to see their story, not force your own into it."
JRPG,3arlzv,magmafanatic,2,Tue Jun 23 12:58:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely. As strange as it is to say, I don't care for role-playing in my Japanese role-playing games. If I could change the JRPG (sub)genre name I would."

JRPG,3arlzv,DQ11,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:07:27 2015 UTC,"I like JRPGs with a focus on everyone. To list some games that I think did this well: Bravely Default, Xenoblade Chronicles, and from what I remember, Chrono Trigger.  Bravely Default jumps around between focusing on the five main characters until at the very end there's finally a central villain to focus on.   Xenoblade has a lot of personal stories of all of the party members, and while some of those stories last longer than others(Shulk and Fiora's arc are at the center a lot of the time), I think that they're all interesting, and sort of become more fleshed out throughout the whole game. Actually, now that I think about it, there is one character who doesn't have any sort of backstory at all: Reyn. Maybe his backstory is hidden in his Heart to Hearts, but I don't think there was a whole lot of mention about his motives or anything other than ""Me buff. Protect Shulk. Is friend."" Not sure what that's about.  And, Chrono Trigger is slightly iffier because I haven't played it for a few years now, but IIRC it had a lot of focus on the whole party and then Crono took some focus near the end."

JRPG,3amsyt,Disturbed001,23,Sun Jun 21 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"The PS2 is a ridiculously difficult system to emulate. In particular, it doesn't conform to IEEE floating point arithmetic standards, so an emulator has to double-check pretty much every single floating point calculation in software. It's hard to do that efficiently. The PCSX2 developer blog is a pretty fascinating read.  Now I don't know anything for sure, but my money is on the PS2 emulation for the PS3 being very heavily optimized for Cell. Rewriting it for the x86 processor in the PS4 is a pretty huge task."

JRPG,3amsyt,7mad,5,Sun Jun 21 22:46:40 2015 UTC,The first 2 have aged better than 3.

They feature varied gameplay too, in addition to the standard random battles, there are large scale strategic war battles and 1v1 duels. Plus 2 has a fucking iron chef mini game, what's not to love? It's a great series, and the first two games are in the better range of the five main games (2 being the undisputed best)."
JRPG,3amsyt,ironically_hip,3,Sun Jun 21 23:01:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty well actually. Battles can be a little slow and monotonous at times, but compared to a lot of releases, it's definitely not bad.  Usually, ""aged"" doesn't mean story or visuals (not always, but usually) but rather how much of a chore it is to get through. I don't think the chore is there."
JRPG,3amsyt,mysticrudnin,2,Mon Jun 22 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty good, im not a fan of the first game tbh art looks a bit dull and everything feels a bit bland compared to Suikoden 2 which is the crown jewel of the whole series with gorgeous pixel art and a story so good it rivals a Game of Thrones ( it actually has a lot of the same themes).

I played the first two months ago and I LOVED them, Suikoden 2 is now one of my favorite games. For some reason though after watching gameplay of this one I just cant help but not like the duck race, or the way the graphics look. I mean normally graphics are not an issue for me and I don't know why I am so turned off by the duck. Please, why is this game so great? I want to, want to play it."
JRPG,3amsyt,ReasonOVERFaith,9,Mon Jun 22 00:52:35 2015 UTC,uhhh... it's great because it's more of suikoden 1 and 2
JRPG,3amsyt,mysticrudnin,5,Mon Jun 22 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"I personally love Suikoden 3, it is one of my top 3 favorite jrpgs and in my top 10 games regardless of genre.  My favorite thing about the game is that it is split between 3 perspectives  There is Hugo, the more or less stereotypical jrpg hero; a young boy who is thrust into heroism due to events beyond his control.  His story traditional jrpg in content  There is Geddoe, the middle-aged stoic leader of a scouting force.  His story is about an group of mercenaries searching for the truth behind the scenes.  His story intertwines less with the other two.  And finally there is Chris Lightfellow, the young commander of an elite group of knights tasked with protecting their homeland.  She is my personal favorite of the three main characters but opinions vary.   You choose what order you play their stories and eventually the three stories converge into one.  Along the way you see the same events from multiple perspectives, and see the events colored by your current groups prejudices.  It is a neat way to tell the story.  And during the game you will find a large number of interesting playable characters (70ish of which are usable in combat).  Also, in addition to regular combat in which you can have 6 fighters at a time, there is also strategic battles and duels (though the duels are a little meh).  As for the graphics, they don't bother me but that is a preference.  I also personally dislike the Ducks but they are only prominent in Hugo's chapters and once the story converges you don't have to use them.  My only problems with the game is that the end game is somewhat disappointing.  There aren't any secret bosses.  And if you spend time gathering every character you will be more than strong enough to beat the main boss.  And my second problem is that Chris Lightfellow (my favorite character) is set up in a way that makes her slightly less useful than the other main characters, but she is still a top tier character.  In the end though I love the game.  I have played it all the way through 3 times and enjoyed it every time."
JRPG,3amsyt,Martel732,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"I've played and completed every Suikoden game multiple times but I can't finish 3, playing as multiple characters, none of whom I found particularly interesting, just takes me out of the game too much. Not to mention that I think the combat in 3 is the worst of the entire series, taking away control of each individual character made for a more shallow/frustrating game for me and the world battles aren't much better. 1 and 2 are some of my all-time favorite games and I love the series as a whole but 3 just had too many departures from what I enjoyed about the games personally.    Many on here, /r/suikoden and www.suikosource.com love 3 though so just check out some gameplay and the characters and see how it fares for you."

JRPG,3amsyt,ReasonOVERFaith,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"The game changes a lot depending on how you take it, if you play as one continuous storyline all the way through it feels a lot more cohesive but doing Chris/Hugo/Geddoe chapter 1 each then chapter 2 can feel like your not progressing much. If you can get past the flaws then from everything I've heard it's a great game with an engaging storyline, it wasn't available here in Aus till long after I'd played 1, 2, 4, 5 and tactics so it felt like a step back to me."

Is the story any good and does the combat hold up well? It was hard to find people that played this game. I guess it was not played by many.
JRPG,3ap677,Cake__Attack,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty unique game. It was one of my favorites when I was younger, and while I don't think it holds together perfectly in all respects, it's definitely does a lot of interesting things and is worth playing.  The combat system is unique and generally fun and challenging, but it's also slow as heck - random encounters can take a long time (there aren't actual random encounters though, you bump into them on the field.)   The story is standard in most respects, but to be as vague as possible there's one plot point that's really surprising and makes the entire plot around it become more interesting because of it. The setting is also rather unique.   Beyond this, the game is quite pretty. The game uses really nice pre-rendered backgrounds - although they are somewhat low resolution by today's standards - and the art-design is top-notch. Music is done by Sakuraba (Tales Of, Star Ocean, Valkryie Profile, Golden Sun) and in my opinion is some of his better work."

JRPG,3ao66z,gizayabasu,13,Mon Jun 22 03:10:31 2015 UTC,"JRPGs can have some terrible pacing and often put way too much stock in their narrative -- most of which are rather juvenile and I have little patience for. Battle systems also tend to fall on the deliberate side with enemies that draw things out for no reason or don't make you think critically. As I've grown older it's become a genre that I really need to sift through to find something worthwhile. It's got to be a damn good game to hold my attention these days.   Bloodborne and Vagrant Story are two recent games I was completely hooked on. Mature storytelling, challenging systems, incredible world building, and just the right length. At the same time, I'm torturing myself trying to get through Tales of Vesperia and Legend of Dragoon, which feel quite the opposite in all aspects. I'm 25 years old and these games just feel way beneath my age demographic."

While I'm kinda interested in the story, later on in the game the battles just drag on and on, even with speeding through enemy turns on an emulator.  I feel like some JRPGs just overstay their welcome. I find that I usually have no problem blasting through ones that last about 24 hours, but if its any longer I usually have trouble completing it unless its really good."
JRPG,3ao66z,SGlespaul,2,Mon Jun 22 03:22:23 2015 UTC,Did they do anything to fix the massive design flaw with VC I and II where it was more efficient to blow all your turns on 1 or 2 characters every round than actually use all your units?  On some missions it was actually the only way to get the best rating.  Just run a heavy gunner into position and blow 3 turns having them stand there murdering things.
JRPG,3ao66z,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:49:14 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Due to the special commands there are still some exploitable missions, but since you learn orders differently you go through most of the game having to use different troops. You'll still use troops more than once each round, but they die so easily and reinforcements come out like wildfire in this one that they need backup.  At least, I have. Shocktroopers still have the potential to destroy tanks with the penetration order too, but you won't get that until you're on your last few chapters.  There's also a few missions where they put a major camp that you have to defend in an unconnected area from the rest of the fight. I thought that was kinda cool."
JRPG,3ao66z,SGlespaul,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"They overstay their welcome, and tend to drag out the end.  The story will have revealed all of its twists, and you just need to get to the final battle... and then 10 hours more of padding between there and the end."
JRPG,3ao66z,nolander,2,Mon Jun 22 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"I get the same way (I bought Bravely Default the month it came out and totally could not focus and neglected it, still haven't finished it) but I think I just have to be in the right mindset. Sometimes I wanna play strategy games and other times I just wanna play super easy, ""i-don't-have-to-think-about-what-i'm-doing"" games. It depends."
JRPG,3ao66z,Kipst3r,2,Mon Jun 22 11:02:31 2015 UTC,"Not really, but I don't play JRPGs (or any RPGs) back to back, really.  I get burnt out when I do.  I'll play a longer game (for example I finished Witcher 3 on the 8th) and then knock out a bunch of shorter titles from my backlog before tackling another long one."
JRPG,3ao66z,merph_,2,Mon Jun 22 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"I tend to do the same thing. I just finished a round of shorter games like the first Walking Dead Tell Tales game, gonna start up Lightning Returns again (since I started it months ago and have since forgotten how to play the game, luckily I wasn't very far in)."
JRPG,3ao66z,RevRay,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"Usually just games I don't like. Some games are hyped and they just don't do anything for me, so I shelve them. But if I'm having a lull like you, I just stop playing games cold turkey. Maybe start up a couple anime series, watch some movies and come back in 2-4 weeks and try playing games again. I started getting really picky with gaming a couple years ago. I can't just play anything anymore. A lot of games and their stories run together now and if I feel like I've played it before, or I just don't like it, I move on."
JRPG,3ao66z,amp3rsand,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:34:48 2015 UTC,This has been happening for me as well.

JRPG,3ao66z,7mad,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:48:15 2015 UTC,"Did you have a slight lifestyle change? Like a fulltime job or new studies.  Lack of time is the biggest JRPG killer, it really is, they need a lot of time, and not having the time just means either never opening them, or only playing for a few hours and never coming back.  Handhelds are good for that though, the short bursts get around lack of time or short attention spans."
JRPG,3ao66z,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"For me a lot of times, I'll start playing a game but then a newer, shinier game will come out, and I'll lose interest. For example, Arkham Knight comes out tomorrow, and as much as I want to get it right away, I know if I do FFVIII will go on the backburner for awhile."
JRPG,3ao66z,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on how good the JRPG is I guess. I bought Pier Solar for PS4, and I just can't get myself to play it. It looked nice at first, but the battle system is very tedious, had no proper explanation of how turns were executed, and just felt very slow overall. I know I will be it eventually, but man."
JRPG,3ao66z,Ppk2128,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like their battle systems just aren't fun anymore after playing so many of them. And when the combat isn't fun, you have to rely on the narrative which also tends to be really bland (compare ""I fight for my friends"" JRPG themes to lovecraftian themes in Bloodborne).  I still get really addicted to challenging tactical RPGs such as Fire Emblem lunatic mode, and FFT was amazing at the time in both story and gameplay. I can't ever finish grind-to-win games that require no skill or thought though and usually just end up watching the cutscenes on youtube."

I'll find a game that I think looks amazing, has a fantastic story and I really want to play it. When I do, I get easily distracted or bored with it and end up giving up.

JRPG,3ao66z,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:02:18 2015 UTC,"I routinely played story driven computer and home console games from 1989 through about 2009. Since then, I've been focusing on portable video games.  There have been times when I've started a story driven video game, liked it... and then set it aside for months or even years. Sometimes I don't want to commit to a heavy drama. At other times, I have been turned off by challenging gameplay. For instance, I really liked the opening scenes in Trails in the Sky. However, I wasn't sure what to make of its emphasis on item crafting, and I didn't feel ready to delve into the story. Some exceptions include...   I didn't expect to like Persona 4. It seemed a bit dour, and it had quite a few unskippable story scenes. However, the story won me over with its combination of flawed-but-not-irredeemable characters and just enough challenging battles. Dragon Quest 9 doesn't have much in terms of story or characters. However, I've played it at least thirty hours so far, and enjoyed most of it. It's not too difficult... most of the time, I can just sit back and walk through dungeons. The world is large and full of distinct towns. A couple weeks ago, I bought Lord of Magna for 3DS. It's been rather enjoyable since then. I'm enjoying the gameplay which allows the characters to bowl over enemies with attacks. Also, I like the art aesthetic and the not-too-serious story. The ""Guadia Quest"" section of Retro Game Challenge is entertaining. It's kind of like DQ2 with a lower level of difficulty and the ability to save everywhere. I also appreciate how it's initially presented through a series of goals to accomplish, and how it can be played extensively later."

JRPG,3ao66z,AKABoondock,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:33:04 2015 UTC,I struggle with final bosses. They tend to require a blend of strategies and I never figured out/mastered a couple of those strategies earlier in the game.
JRPG,3ao66z,magmafanatic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"I play multiple games at the same time and don't hesitate to spend multiple months playing through a game.  The games will be from different genres, so at any given time I could be playing through an FPS, a JRPG, and a platformer at the same time (for example).  If I'm not feeling one game that day I play something else.  I'm also willing to let weeks or months go by between play session in a game.  Especially with RPG's, I love them but there's usually a point where you've learned the combat system and you've gotten reasonably familiar with the characters so the pacing slows down for you.  When that happens I just let myself wander off to something else and come back when I'm ready to push through the mid-game (my experience is that most RPG's drag in the mid game).  I recently did exactly that with Trails in the Sky due to how slow the combat was.  The ending was phenomenal, I loved how it ended, and I'm super excited about the next game in the series.  My taking so much time to beat games is more about me than the quality of the game."
JRPG,3ao66z,mreiland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:45:48 2015 UTC,Personally I love a good long jrpg even if I'm not able to finish it haha  However it can be frustrating if it's TOO long (still trying to chug through xenoblade)

According to the In-game timer I was at 6 hours only, which surprised me, maybe it didn't count the time passed during the 10000 random battles I'd had, even if they were all quick. But considering I was only doing plot, no side quests that seems really short. I actually quit at this point as I still couldn't get into the game but estimate that the game is probably around 15 hours, seems short for a JRPG no?"

JRPG,3amfjl,Lisis_M,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:45:02 2015 UTC,"I mean the story portion of the game. Most of the games people mentioned they're speaking about the plot, not the sidequests or extra stuff, or NG+.  Ie: Most of the Final Fantasy games are minimum of 20-30 hours without any sidequests or spending hours grinding.  Trails in the sky is around 30 hours without doing any sidequests  Popolocrois takes 20 hours without sidequests (though tbh it doesn't really HAVE more than 2 sidequests).  Breath of Fire III and IV take roughly 20-30 hours minimum without sidequests.  All of those games still long games with cheats or special benefits, when doing only the story/essential stuff to progress, Tales of Eternia does not seem to be long unless doing the sidequests, which appear to be the bulk of the games length."
JRPG,3amfjl,EpsilonX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:16:00 2015 UTC,"A bit late to the party, but I'm in the midst of Eternia right now.  I was at around 12 hours once I beat Celcius. Considering I beat most Tales games pretty damn fast (around 20-25 hours), this is one of the more difficult Tales I've played (having played every one released in the West so far), and I haven't touched any sidequests, it sounds like you're rushing through the game hardcore.  Also, I'm 15 hours in now and have no idea what you mean by leveling with chests."
JRPG,3amfjl,Papissama,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:43:38 2015 UTC,"It was a typo, I meant cheats sorry.  Basically I have little time, and Eternia was on my hacked vita, but it was the last game I needed to finish (Got no PSP and its not on Euro PSN) before I could update my Vita to play my other newer games. So I plugged a cheat early on to max my character levels but thats it. Made the combat easier, though I was only doing like 600 damage most of the time because I'm still using the weapons you'd expect by that point.  I'm not rushing through it though, I speak to every NPC (some of them say some really interesting stuff, was learning about the world etc), I didn't do any of the optional mini-games though (I'm not a fan of PS1 mini-games, and this game has some bad/pointless ones), I went to the areas the characters said, spent a good 20 minutes trying to find the fire craymels cave though.  Essentially i went where the game TOLD me to go, I did skip over the optional stuff but that aside, for the main plot (usually what I do first time through a game, 2nd is sidequests, 100%ing etc) it seemed quite short, really took me by surprise. The plot seemed interesting but details coming in a little too slow, nobody asking the questions they probably should have asked ages ago etc.  Difficulty wise I can't comment since I cheated, something I've done in like 2 JRPGS in my life, you just defeated the Craymel I was about to start before I just switched off then. Which is a little over halfway through the game, how long did it take you to get there, even wide all sidequests included.  Its possible it feels shorter than it was, and that the games timer doesn't record events or battles, so it only recorded 5 hours of me wandering from place to place etc."

JRPG,3aimy0,deadering,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how they mention that console gaming is in decline, and yet they were given the green light to commence development of the game, regardless. Is the transition from console to mobile exclusively a Japanese trend, or is that true of Western audiences, as well? As far as I can tell, console gaming is alive and well, but I understand that it's drastically declining in Japan.  The fact that Square Enix gave the okay for this game's development makes me wonder if they're trying to go with a ""best of both worlds"" approach to the differing trends - that is, develop and release console games to Western audiences, but focus on mobile platforms in their home territory. In fact, Enix has make several moves, recently, towards strategies that seem unconventional for Japanese audiences, but ideal for Western gamers - as if they acknowledge that console/PC gaming is dying in Japan, but still very much alive and rife with opportunity in the West. Their recent move towards the PC, as a gaming platform, and their continued commitment towards the Xbox series of consoles (despite being widely unpopular in Japan, but the most popular amongst Western audiences) can attest to this.  Either way, it's nice to see Square Enix give this development the green light, but it also has me wondering if this is part of a much larger business strategy where, instead of taking on the mantra of ""Japanese first, Western second"", they realize that there's a lot of money to be made from Western audiences and that it'd be smarter to think of the two territories as separate entities to develop for, instead of Western audiences as being just a second thought. Especially since the Japanese and the Western versions of the original game were so different, thematically (at least, in terms of the Nier/Yonah relationship dynamics), it makes me wonder if they saw this and thought of a sequel as being a sort of testing grounds for this new found philosophy. It'd be pleasantly fitting, at the very least."

JRPG,3ah9lx,samuraigaiden,35,Sat Jun 20 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"“In more traditional RPGs, as the story unfolds, you get more and more people joining the party. Sometimes, at some point, if you have more than four or six, you have to choose who to form the party with. In this game we don’t have that. We’re going to make all party members featured and physical in the field.”   :O !!!!!!

JRPG,3ah9lx,Indoorsman,3,Sat Jun 20 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"Because first, you need to take note of the lag that may result. Computing actions for almost double the party members than usual in real-time coupled with the particle effects and everything makes it a pretty tricky beast, and you need to sustain reasonable performance. People wouldn't like something that has graphical and performance issues.  On top of that, the balancing is completely different and I would say tougher, because it's much easier to skew the odds to favor one or the other. AoE attacks need to be executed perfectly in order for it not to quickly overwhelm one side all the time, and they need to make sure that the player's side don't kill off single-target scenarios like bosses really quickly. I would also say that introducing new mechanics and enemy AI behavior becomes much more difficult than usual because of the aforementioned reasons.  Same here, definitely very excited at seeing how they can pull this off, because depending on how well it does, we might see this kind of design decision trending in future JRPGs, particularly of the AAA level."

JRPG,3ah9lx,gildedkitten,2,Sat Jun 20 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be really honest: I hope they do consider it.   Remember, the reason why turn based battle systems exist in the first place is because that's what tabletop RPGs did. The reason why tabletop RPGs did it is because that was just the best way to represent a battle at the time.   I know many people might disagree in this case, but to me personally (not saying that other opinions are wrong!), it feels like trying to keep paper newspapers or cable TV around in the age of the internet. I assume a lot of horse shoe-ers were angry too when automobiles started to become popular."
JRPG,3ah9lx,cmnamost,7,Sat Jun 20 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"I actually think the turn-based battles and limited party size were more due to limitations in processing power than adhering to DnD conventions. By the time FF7 came out, JRPGs had definitely branched off a good bit from their tabletop roots.  But now that they're remaking the game on the PS4, those limitations are practically nonexistant. It really makes me excited to see what they can do with all that horsepower. I just hope this doesn't become another George Lucas-style affair."
JRPG,3ah9lx,gildedkitten,2,Sat Jun 20 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is that every real time battle system Square has tried has made the games worse. To this date, Xenoblade is the only real time system I've found that even comes close to being as much fun as turn based...  At least, without entirely ditching any remnants of being an rpg and just turning it into an action game. The hybrid systems always feel like the worst aspects of both games, losing the strategic precision of turn based and the responsive exhilaration of action games for something clunky, frustrating, and ultimately unable to sustain a game of average jrpg length."

JRPG,3ah9lx,zerosaver,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:57:08 2015 UTC,"star ocean 4 had 4 people using huge skills and symbols and lagged a bit on PS3, if they can't get 6 to play without lag on PS4 then they need to lessen the particle effects."

You can check the remaining time at the game's store page (17½h remaining at the moment).  And for what it is worth: I do fully recommend Trails in the Sky. It is one of my favorite game series as well (maybe even #1). The amount of details in the series is astonishing (just try talking to the NPCs) and the soundtrack is nothing short of amazing. Just be aware that it starts veeery slowly and contains walls of text.
JRPG,3afvx3,kysoft,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:37:35 2015 UTC,Didn't know that. Neat.
JRPG,3afvx3,kysoft,5,Sat Jun 20 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"Game has a huge emphasis on making the setting feel fleshed out.  Every NPC has a name and pretty much every NPC's dialogue will change after every minor piece of story progression.  It's hard to think of something else that tried that.  Maybe Mother 3, they had that whole goal of making one town full of people feel like it was changing over time instead of having you move from town to town in typical JRPG fashion.  Thing is though, you do move from town to town in typical JRPG fashion in Trails, dunno, its hard to compare it to something else.  Combat is basically the simplest SRPG I've ever played, not amazing but not bad.  The music is amazing and the writing is generally very good.  The one major problem with the game is the pacing.  The first couple chapters are basically carried by the strength of the characters alone, if you don't immediately find them likeable and interesting then it can be difficult to see a reason to push onwards, there doesn't really seem to be much of an overall plot for the first couple chapters.  Things ramp up about halfway through the game and it gets really intense by the end, but I suspect a lot of people never make it out of the first or second towns because it seems like there's nothing driving the plot forward."
JRPG,3afvx3,just_ate_a_pinecone,2,Sat Jun 20 01:10:40 2015 UTC,Is there a downside to purchasing this on gog rather than steam?  Or vice versa?

JRPG,3afvx3,CrispyPixel,2,Fri Jun 19 22:44:32 2015 UTC,"SC shouldn't be far of July, August probably, they said that they will look into the third game which is a side story and acts like bridge to the next 2 games (zero and azure) if the sales of SC are good. They also just registered the domains for zero and azure : http://whois.domaintools.com/trailstoazure.com so they seem to have confidence in continuing the series.They later  trails of cold steel games which are set after those where just announced for vita and ps3 the first game will be released at the end of the year, unfortunately no steam port planned so far."
JRPG,3afvx3,bladeraiden,2,Sat Jun 20 00:25:11 2015 UTC,Second Chapter is supposed to come out this summer. None of the others have been confirmed.
JRPG,3afvx3,danna45,2,Fri Jun 19 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"SC is confirmed.  If it sells well maybe Falcom'll port Cold Steel but it seems more likely that they'll wait and see how well it sells on PS3 and Vita first.  They've basically said that localizations of Azure, Zero and TC are dependent on how well SC and Cold Steel sell.  I believe Azure and TC already have PC versions, so Zero is really the only one that Falcom would have to put any major effort into to bring west, its very unlikely that anyone will buy it if it remains a PSP exclusive.  The Vita remakes are pretty much guaranteed to never come west, they're made by a completely separate company.  I had also heard, though I don't know how true it is, that the company is not interested in localization outside of Asia."
JRPG,3afvx3,xSora08,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:16:56 2015 UTC,I said fuck it and picked up this along with Dishonored and Tales From the Borderlands.

JRPG,3afpgp,The_Sordid_Critic,9,Fri Jun 19 19:32:55 2015 UTC,All of Bravely Default's faults for me were made up for by the final confrontation. The grand scale of it and the FUCKING MUSIC cleansed the games of all faults and pacing issues for me.

JRPG,3afpgp,Bamiji,9,Tue Jun 23 08:18:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the second half of the game.  It never bothered me one slight bit because you understood the party's frustration; that, plus most of it was optional anyway (trying not to reveal too much).  Having all the jobs you acquire each come from a unique character in the story was one of my favorite things.  You never ran into two or more different summoners or salvemakers in the world (aside from in your party), like you would in a FF game that has a village of black mages or some shit.  You guys should play it!  I have 150 hours of playtime on it, though some of it was from falling asleep trying to play it late into the night and into the next morning."
JRPG,3afpgp,redswoon,8,Fri Jun 19 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"I completely understood the party's frustration, but I thought the second half was a bit uh... excessive.  Loved the game other than that."

JRPG,3afpgp,SuperShmamBro,4,Fri Jun 19 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"I'm on record for my distaste of the repetition at the end, and I've been trying to figure out their rationale for the way they did it. It wasn't to pad length, as there's already a sizable adventure to that point. There's no additional plot put in after the second go; in fact, all of the dialogue gets re-used.  The only thing I can think of is that it increases the probability a given player will try something new and trigger the ""bad"" ending, leading to one of the better sequences we've seen in RPGs. Unfortunately you kind of get an ""our Princess is in another castle"" moment when it's all over. If you can drop that and all the rest that goes toward the ""good"" ending I think you have a solid, ""A-"" RPG. At the very least they could have thrown in some new dialogue in the later iterations. It gets to a point where you disconnect from the party--you know what's going on, you feel like they know what's going on, but nothing's said about it.  Instead we get that. All I could think about while trudging along on the path to the Fire Crystal again was whether I'd finish it if I were playing the original Japanese version with no slider for encounters. Probably not."
JRPG,3afpgp,tradesojack,4,Sat Jun 20 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"There's no additional plot put in after the second go; in fact, all of the dialogue gets re-used.   I really feel that people, when they hear about this game, have the idea that the developers literally just copy paste the second half of the game. Sure, you repeat the whole break the crystals , but to be honest the bosses are really easy past chapter 5 and they literally take few minutes to beat. Also, you have the ability to turn down encounters to 0%. So you can skip useless encounters in dungeons. The cool thing is how the game changes with each chapter, just from the top of my head:   Chapter 5: You and the characters have no idea what just happened and the asterisk bosses still seem to dislike you. Some fight have different outcomes like the one with Fiore DeRossa and Kikyo. It's also funny doing the vampire castle and Lester being confused on how you know everything already.  Chapter 6: This is when you start to get small, but fun details. Like Profiteur revealing that Khint turned into a mercenary to pay for the treatment of her daughter, the orphans crying because they thought Jackal was dead after the battle, Holly and Barras having a pretty funny scene playing dead after defeating them, Praline singing at the tavern after defeating her, etc. In this world, they no longer want the vestal dead, they want to take her safe. This is also the world were you do the quest to get the conjurer job which is pretty emotional. They are given the choice to stay on this world since Olivia and Til are alive. Artenis perishes because Edea dies and Ringabel is offered to take his place. Edea reunites with her mourning parents because they thought she was dead(which she was in this world) and she's offered to stay. All of this had a pretty impact and when the chapter ends you really start liking some of the asterisk characters  Chapter 7: In this chapter you actually start fighting the bosses in groups and they all have likable personalities  Chapter 8: At this point, you know the Asterisk bosses are not bad guys, you get pretty funny and tough battles to prepare you for the final boss.  I think the reason people hated Chapters 5-8 was because all through chapters 1-4, there was always something new to look. Like new dungeons, new towns, new NPC's, new jobs to discover, etc. When people discovered there was no new land to uncover after Chapter 5, that was the moment they started to get bored. They don't care about the back story of the asterisk bosses, they don't want to think in clever ways regarding the story. They want new experiences...they just want to finish the game and move on to the next new experience. That's my two cents."
JRPG,3afpgp,FaceShrine,2,Sat Jun 20 03:33:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I was attempting to be intentionally vague to limit spoilers in a thread that might have discussion among those who haven't played it. After Chapter 5 is what I was referring to. You have the scenes with Yulyana and that's it. Everything else along the main plot path is quite literally copied,  aside from a few lines of dialogue here and there.  It's just very strange to me that this part of the game had so little polish compared to everything else. As you mention, there's quite a bit of character development in the side content, but it's also not accessible in later chapters.  I have minor quibbles with the larger game, but lack of polish isn't among them. This just sticks out."
JRPG,3afpgp,tradesojack,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:55:50 2015 UTC,"They don't care about the back story of the asterisk bosses   Because they really didn't give us any great reason to care.  In that regard, one might suggest that the change from chapter to chapter was too subtle. But whether or not people want to rush through content, the fact that the game turned into a BASIC program that ended with 30 GOTO 10 was a major drawback to the game.  But everything else... everything else they got right. Wish they would hurry up with the NA release of Bravely Second!"

So there is actually some overlap, but aside from the Gameboy games they're all a standalone game and its direct sequel. That said, it's worth mentioning that most if not all of the Ganondorfs/Ganons actually are the same person."

JRPG,3aca0l,deadering,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:31:42 2015 UTC,Is the 13 port terrible or is it just bad but playable? I had 13 for 360 but never finished it and lost it in a recent move. Now it's on sale and I'm wondering if I should pick it up.
JRPG,3ae37i,Kindara,8,Fri Jun 19 11:02:22 2015 UTC,"Golden Sun  Really fun battle system.  I like the art the game has, especially considering the fact it runs on the GBA.  I'm actually playing it on my Wii U gamepad, which so far has been a pretty good experience.  Story is alright and characters are alright.  Not really blown away by either yet, but I shall see as I progress through the game."
JRPG,3ae37i,Phoxxent,6,Sat Jun 20 02:40:34 2015 UTC,"It was a fantastic game when I played it back in the day. It really was able to capture the imaginiation, and I love how the story doesn't try to make itself more than it is. It doesn't try to ask questions on the importance of government or disproving god through friendship, it just has a classic tale of catastrophe and peace, of innocence and evil, of swords and sworcery. This is the game that helped define ""Fantasy"" for me. I agree that the combat is amazing, but the WiiU does it no favors. Too bad you can't make the ""screen"" smaller to about the size it was on the GBA."
JRPG,3ae37i,itsausernamerite,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the graphics for these games on the GBA were probably the best the system had to offer. I remember my twelve year old self being totally awestruck the whole time. Fond memories of my first real rpg :)"
JRPG,3ae37i,Kindara,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:37:17 2015 UTC,I actually don't mind playing on the Wii U Gamepad.  It's actually pretty neat lol.  Playing it on my 40 inch HDTV on the other hand...is another story.  I forgot to mention how much I really like the music.  Funny how GS and Mario Golf: Advanced Tour use the same engine (Camelot and all.)
JRPG,3ae37i,Kaosubaloo,2,Sun Jun 21 06:15:38 2015 UTC,"I've also been playing Golden Sun/The Lost Age. I think it definitely had some nostalgia going for it in my head, but even so I still think it's one of the strongest JRPG experiences on the GBA.  One thing that continues to stand out to me is the puzzle design with Psynergy use. Golden Sun puts a lot of emphasis on puzzle solving outside of battles in a way that you don't usually see in JRPGs."
JRPG,3ae37i,alleycw,6,Mon Jun 22 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"I just started playing through Parasite Eve again, and wow I forgot how great this game is.

JRPG,3ae37i,shuriken36,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"I couldn't put down Tales of Hearts after about 5 hours in. Starts out slow, but then it just feels really good. I especially love the progression system how you have limited control over how you build your stats.  Conceptio 2 I got bored of, but want to pick it up again.  I just remember Parasite Eve being really short which irked me. But the story was freaking awesome."
JRPG,3ae37i,alleycw,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll keep going with Tales. I'm kind of bothered by the fact that they keep dumping characters on me, without giving me much back story on them. I hoping that changes later on?"
JRPG,3ae37i,shuriken36,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:46:58 2015 UTC,Yeah. The introductions sucked but it's got ok character development and solid back story imo

But it's fun and allows for a huge cast with decent character development and plot progression. Almost at 100 hours and only about 85% through the game. Strange as it is though I wish there were a few more real side quests throughout the game, as sometimes you just want to battle a few times after a really long cutscene..."
JRPG,3ae37i,itsausernamerite,4,Fri Jun 19 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of late to this thread, but I'm playing Fire Emblem: Awakening currently, and it is my first FE game. I am so disappointed in myself for never picking up one of these games until now! I am absolutely loving it, probably more than Final Fantasy Tactics which was my introduction to Strategy RPGs. The story is compelling, and I love hooking my characters up to make sweet OP children, which /r/fireemblem seems to hate about this game. Guess I'm a filthy weeaboo casual, but I'm happy with my purchase :P"
JRPG,3ae37i,LoonyMoonie,3,Sat Jun 20 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"Tales of Hearts R (Vita): I'm...enjoying it a lot, actually? Those who like Tales of Symphonia may feel at home with Hearts R, since it actually borrows several elements from Symphonia in terms of items, gameplay, and even one or two plot elements. On the other hand, battle system is very fluid and more in line with PS3 Tales games. It has neither great graphics nor epic storylines as in home-console Tales, but it still looks great on the Vita and manages to be both charming and entertaining. It's a Tales game through and through; whether that's a good thing or not, that's up to you to decide.  Translation! My Japanese vocabulary is limited to a handful of words, so I can't really judge the quality of the translation. Even someone like me can tell that they took a lot of freedom with the script, though; you'll notice often that what the script says is not quite what the voice is saying. Some word choices are also questionable but overall, it's not really a case of broken English and the script does make sense in context. Translation certainly wasn't a deal breaker, at least for me.  I would definitely recommend Hearts R if you're already a Tales fan. If you're not, this is not the best game to get into the franchise, but it's still a solid JRPG and a valuable addition to the Vita library. Consider giving a look to it, at least."
JRPG,3ae37i,alleycw,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll keep plugging away it. It seems to me that eihter there's something of an input-delay, or maybe I'm not good at the game. But I can't for the life of me get the guard/counter to work if I'm already attacking. It's like there's a second or two delay before I can guard after an attack. Other than that the game seems enjoyable, it's also slightly off-putting how they just dump party members on you in the first few hours."

JRPG,3ae37i,Electrium,2,Mon Jun 22 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"I got way into Final Fantasy X-2 the last couple weeks. After getting the PS4 version I felt like trying at 100% again, since my last attempt ages ago I missed .2% and ruined everything.  This is my third play through and I still really love this game. The battle system rewards fast and precise play with its combos, the dressphere designs are cool, and overall the tone is casual and just very unusual among RPGs and games in general. I had forgotten how great the dynamic is between Rikku and Paine, too.  I'm finishing up Chapter 3 now and still on track for 100%, so hopefully next time I post in one of these threads it won't be to rage at the game's awful completion metrics."
JRPG,3ae37i,starlizzle,2,Fri Jun 19 18:49:36 2015 UTC,Wow your original play through sounds just like mine Haha. I didn't talk to a moogle at the start of the game. I was PISSED when I got to the end and it said 99%
JRPG,3ae37i,Electrium,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"99?!?! Good god. I was following one of the 100% walkthroughs out there and noticed that at the beginning of Chapter 3 I was .2% lower than I thought, I can't imagine getting through the whole game and barely missing it"
JRPG,3ae37i,starlizzle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:44:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I was so mad. I followed the guide book but somehow missed this tiny paragraph + picture at the very beginning of the game. Ughhhh. Needless to say I just watched the perfect ending on YouTube lol

And I know a lot of people harp on the combat, but I quite enjoy it, even if the AI is dumb as a rock. Plus the Pokemon-like mechanics are right up my alley.   I've also ordered Tales of Symphonia Chronicles (or Unisonant Pack, as it's called in Japan). It should get here in around a week, I hope. I'm planning to play through all the PS3 Tales games over summer, so that's the first title on the list."

Got half way through Tales of Eternia (destiny II for americans) and gsve up, i got to celestia and i could nit get into it, the combats ok, but scatterbrain with off controls but the plot and characters, nothing drew me in.  From here i moved onto Legend of Heroes White Witch got to the first mirror and gave in, the movement was so clunky and having to line up perfectly with NPCs just to talk to them was really annoying. The combat wasn't too bad and as far as I got the translation was fine, I'm sure like Trails in The Sky it takes several hours to really get going, but this time due to the aforementioned annoyances, plus the annoying maze like dungeons, I couldn't do it so I stopped.  Now I've moved onto Grandia, first time playing this, my god I love it! Just gotten onto the ghost ship, it's like 4 hours in, but it's great, nice characters, good backstory and mythology. Terrible terrible dubbing but I can look past that with no problems. Really hoping this game scratches the itch I've had since before starting Trails in the sky ( it didn't scratch my need to save the world itch)."
JRPG,3ae37i,Hierarch555,2,Sat Jun 20 09:24:03 2015 UTC,"I'm playing Ni No Kuni.  As soon as I got the chance I read through a lot of the Wizard's Companion and loved the descriptions and art for the armor and weapons.  I go into the other world and realize the MC can't use or wear any of it (minus jewelry and wands).  I get that it had to be that way, do to the animated cutscenes, but I was disappointed.  Other than that the game is charming, gorgeous, funny, and fun.  I'm about to fight a certain purple boss and I hope it goes ok."

Since I have a 3DS and have interest in Persona Q, I figured I'd beat Persona 3 first so that I'd understand the references and fan service better for both games in Q. So far I really like P3's soundtrack, and there are a few tweaks in the gameplay to feel a little more different than what I'm used to in P4."

JRPG,3ae37i,starlizzle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:45:49 2015 UTC,So you only control the main character?
JRPG,3ae37i,irmoony,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, which can be kind of a pain, especially since it's game over if the MC dies, and you can't exactly control when the party members heal.   I don't remember this being that much of an issue on my playthrough, though."
JRPG,3ae37i,starlizzle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:15:22 2015 UTC,IIRC in P4 when the MC dies you get game over as well. I kinda wanna play P3 now lol
JRPG,3ae37i,irmoony,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, but at least you can control your other party members in P4, so you don't end up dying because the AI decided to use Marin Karin instead of healing you...   And P3 is a great game, so I'd say go for it"

JRPG,3ae37i,shikitohno,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"I've also picked up P3FES and been enjoying it after starting off on P4G and was initially worried about this.  For the most part, it works out okay, but it can be frustrating when the AI makes tactically poor choices.  Lots of times your team mates could get you an all-out attack if they just spammed one spell against all the shadows in a group.  Instead, they'll knock one down and hit it again, wasting the advantage.  Another annoyance is when they spend their turns healing each other and wasting healing items when they could have taken the enemy out if they just attacked, dragging out the battle way longer than it needs to be.  That said, I'm really starting to enjoy it.  The story is taking a bit to build up a good head of steam, but it's got a pretty interesting world, and I'm looking forward to seeing where the st ory goes.

JRPG,3ae37i,BobCrosswise,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"Playing Arabian Nights - Sabaku no Seirei Ou (Super Famicom - Japan only - fan translation by LostTemplar)  It's a very endearing game, with good characters, an interesting story, great graphics and a fairly intuitive combat system.  I did run across one thing in it though that I'd count as one of the most rage-inducing things I've ever seen in a game.  It has one part where you get sucked into a dungeon that's been created by a genie and have to find your way out.  The first part of it is relatively straightforward exploration/puzzle solving.  Then you reach this point where you have to navigate an enormous hidden labyrinth.  Standard 16bit stuff - you see a mark on a wall that's suspicious and if you investigate it, it opens into a hidden passage, and you can't see the party while they're ""inside"" the wall, so you're moving blind, just ""feeling"" your way through it.  But the part that's inside the wall is not only very long - it's a true labyrinth, complete with multiple paths, T intersections and dead ends, and with random encounters all along the way.  I rage-quit twice trying to get through that, and honestly considered just giving up on the game entirely, and if it wasn't for the fact that it's otherwise so endearing and enjoyable, I would've.  And as is always the case when I run across something like that in a game, I could only wonder what sort of moron put it in there.  But other than that, it's been a great game."
JRPG,3ae37i,norn_necro,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy XIII on PC  Bought the game on steam recently. I got the game knowing its linearity, but honestly I'm fine with it. These days, I mostly play JRPGs/RPGs for their story. My personal preference is to usually set game settings to an easy difficulty just so I can get through the game and experience the story. Not looking to get the best equips, items, spells, w/e. I'm willing to do some sidequests when I run into them, but I won't make it my priority or go super out of my way to complete one.    Only have ~3hrs in, but I think it's great so far.   Pros   Graphics are awesome (one of the main reasons i got the game). Characters seem interesting so far. I really enjoy games with a lot of voice acting, makes the game more lively and makes me feel like I have more of a connection with the characters. One of the main reasons I love playing the Tales series.     So far all my battles have been going through pretty quickly. Maybe because it's set to easy? But I also feel like if I was on normal it wouldn't make much of a difference. Less time fighting means the story advances faster for me, which is what I prefer.  Combat system seems cool. It's very simple, but I'm sure it'll pick up in strategy and complexity later on. As of right now I still only have regular attack and 1 skill lol.  Lightning is hot   Cons   I know a lot of people have stuttering and fps issues, but i haven't experienced any. I heard plugging in a controller, which I am using, can solve this issue. The other fixes are more laborous, so luckily I didn't have to deal with it. The terms they use: l'Cia, Fal'Cie, Pulse Fal'Cie etc seem confusing at first; I'm still a little confused even now but I'm sure I'll catch on to it. And if not, it's not a big deal to me.   I read online you can't change up your party members until pretty late in the game. The reviews about the game being linear are no jokes. I'm only 3 hours in the game and so far point A to point B is... pretty linear lol    All the cons I've posted aren't really cons for me, it's just a list of cons for most people. I'm literally playing this game as if I were watching an anime. So for those of you who like RPGs just for the story, I'd say this is a pretty good game to pick up. If you're more into gaming complexity and exploring open worlds, maybe you should read up other reviews to see if this game is for you."
JRPG,3ae37i,starlizzle,2,Fri Jun 19 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed 13. I highly highly highly recommend you take the time to read ALL of the data log.

A friend convinced me to try it after playing to our mutual adoration of Tales of Vesperia and describing some interesting parallels and I have no regrets (expect for the times when I zone out mid battle and get wrecked as a result).

JRPG,3ae37i,darkdrgon2136,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:16:50 2015 UTC,"I picked up Final Fantasy 13 when it was on sale since I haven't played it since launch, and decided to give it another try, with an open mind.  I tried to like it, to understand  more of what the developers were working towards, but I still think it's an awful game. You shouldn't have to read a companion novel to understand a games plot, the characters spend the first 15 hours as cardboard cutouts, everyone knows it's linear, and above all the game is slow.  It takes hours, and way more battles than it should, to get to the point where the class system opens up. None of the enemies are difficult, but they have so much HP and defense that they take forever to kill, and the game has no idea how to balance it's rewards out. This hit me hardest when playing a section as Vanille and Sazh (the only likable character so far), and being given a tutorial bubble that this one monster is really tough for a 2 man party, better sneak around it! I was ready for a challenge, and was hoping for a good reward from the item box behind it. 12 minutes later, none of my characters came close to death, and all I have to show for it is 90-ish cp (not enough to move 1 spot on the grid), a piece of armadillo skin, and the box had 3 vials of monster piss  or something in it.   That was the point that made me stop going out of my way for chests, it was never worth it. I'm currently 22 hours in, and haven't felt I needed to bother with the upgrade system, which is another overly confusing waste of time.  I'm only finishing it because I promised a friend we'd go through it together, and to try 13-2, which is supposed  to fix some of the problems. Being on disability leave and the pain meds  I need to take are helping too"
JRPG,3ae37i,norn_necro,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:19:44 2015 UTC,"i thought the upgrade system was pretty simple. just choose which materials you want to level your equips. if you're still not understanding it, or forgot how to, the data log explains how to do everything"

And the system ruined loot, there's nothing fun to find in the world. Half the treasure boxes have animal splooge,  bits of broken gears, and lengths of string. Who put those in floating boxes? Why? Where's my treasure? At this point in other rpgs I can go around the world or take a harder path in a dungeon to get a badass  flaming sword, or staff with some ancient Magic backstory."

The story however is made up entirely of generic anime tropes, which I find entertaining. Also the story is told visual novel style, which is not what I was expecting. The dungeons are pretty short and disappointing, and the lack of a world map tonrun around in makes the game feel small. Definitely not a great game, but I am only about 6 hours in."

I got the game a year ago, but I ragequit because I died at the first dungeon (the ruins at Whipple) and didn't feel like going through the dungeon all over again.  I practically had flashbacks from Ninja Boy 2.  Anyway, I recently beat Zelda: Twilight Princess and was looking at my collection for another game to play.  I saw Star Ocean and grabbed the game and basically continued right where I left off.  Took me less than 10 minutes to re-orient myself (which was weird because I had only spent 2 hours on the game previously).  I really like the game so far.  It's exciting, and the combat system is really nice.  To me, the combat system is like Legend of Dragoon in which you get to select attacks and choose to complete them or not - rather than hacking and slashing like many Final Fantasy games (my JRPG experience is limited to mostly Final Fantasy games).    With that said, last night, I learned the hard way that one can die by running out of MP.  Was a very ""what the hell"" moment for me.  It is an additional, welcome challenge for me.  I look forward to the rest of the game.  Additionally, I look forward to getting that ring that allows me to clear debris so I can collect those yummy chests I've been spotting around."

Not too much as to bore me but enough to keep me going into the various dungeons.   Thinking of grabbing either Take of Hearts R next or Persona 3 on the Vita."

Yes, because we all stick to career decisions we vaguely declared in an interview nearly a decade ago, right?  Talk about a clickbait article at its finest."

JRPG,3a9nt8,IdTheDemon,-5,Thu Jun 18 23:12:34 2015 UTC,His character designs are fine. They all fit the game they're in. It's the Combat system of KH that's atrocious to many fans of the old school FF games.
JRPG,3a9nt8,blazecc,5,Thu Jun 18 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"...why would you play a game called Kingdom Hearts and expect it to play like FF? Like, not liking KH combat is fine, I'm not a huge fan either, but it's not like they advertised it as the next FF game. It was always a spinoff. The very first trailer will tell you that much."

JRPG,3a9nt8,BluesRhap,3,Fri Jun 19 06:09:20 2015 UTC,"And even then, if the KH combat system were presented as an option in the remake (and I stress that it must NOT be mandatory), I would love the hell out of that game. I love ATB a lot, and I'd definitely play with that sort of combat system nowadays, but I can't deny that KH has done a lot for action-JRPGs, even influencing todays mainline FFs. It would present something new that fans of KH and the newer FFs could enjoy, while still retaining the older system so that fans of the classics could still have their nostalgia trip like we were promised. Of course, you've also got people like me who love both, and would be happy to play the game multiple times to try both.  This would create a significant time investment on the part of the battle directing team, but it would pay off by appealing to a lot more RPG fans than a VII remake normally would."
JRPG,3a9nt8,TheLastSamurai14,2,Thu Jun 18 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"Compared to the INSANE level of asset generation necessary for this, I don't really think combat design is going to tip the scales of the budget either way.   I would LOVE to see the two systems side by side in the remake. If the new school system is ever going to win me other this would be its best shot, but I don't think it's worth it to lose the charm of the original."
JRPG,3a9nt8,blazecc,7,Thu Jun 18 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"Incredibly well-put - you can see that in the interviews that are trickling out from E3, too.  My boss has got a couple of freelancers out there, and I think one of them is trying to get some Nomura time... all I've asked them to ask is about how it feels for Nomura to be going back to this: it must have been emotional for him, surely?  I mean, this game took three years of his life, and he's not shy about letting people know the downs were as intense as the ups. He's an auteur for FFVII, and how many people can you say that about in gaming, generally?"

Granted, I don't know how this one will wrap up so it could make sense but 6 games is a lot for one character.    I would love some in-universe expansion like Eraqus and Xehanort's rise to power (which the KH3 trailer hints we might be getting) or anything related to the Keyblade Wars.

JRPG,3a7tdd,Jamaz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:16:27 2015 UTC,"How did you feel about FFX?  I ask because you ding 13 for being too linear, but recently playing the FFX HD remaster reminded me that FFX is just as, if not moreso ""on rails"" as FFXIII was and people loved it.  There's no exploration, there's no choice, you can rarely go back to previous areas (until the end), its just a straight line from objective to objective the whole game through."
JRPG,3a7tdd,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"It has been a long time, but I recall FFX being pretty good due to the incredibly refreshing battle system and graphics. The towns and settings were the most detailed you could ever see at the time, and I never ""felt"" I was on a linear journey from point A to B. It must have been since it was so early in my gaming career that I didn't care about it, but honestly, the CTB battle system, sphere grid, and monster mechanics just won me over so whole-heartedly that I likely chose to forget any negatives. FF13 encounters and bosses were just so utterly boring and easy that I felt like I had to complain about everything because of the bad mood I was in.  I also loved the hell out of Blitzball - I don't know, but landing a Jecht-shot from half the field was just the most satisfying thing ever."
JRPG,3a7tdd,Jamaz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Building on that, the sphere grid and the crystarium are practically the same progression system with a slightly different UI.  The only major difference is that the sphere grid doesn't expand as you clear each chapter, so in FFX you could grind all the way to level 3 spells in the first area if you really wanted to.  I dunno, there's just so many parallels in design between the two games, yet one is near universally loved and the other is heavily panned.  I'm sure you're right and a lot of it is rose colored glasses, as FFX was the first FF game for a lot of people, the first that featured full VA, and the first with an emphasis on graphical fidelity."
JRPG,3a7tdd,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I felt the FF13 progression was very limiting in the way that it was really just a line with tiny side paths for stats. And then if I wanted a character to be something completely different, like Sazh into a tank, the game punished you by being much more expensive to progress in that path. From a min/maxing standpoint, you can only build a character one way unless you were willing to spend several hours leveling up an odd build.  All this is moot, though, if you simply hate the combat. Me, my coworkers, and friends who played the game all talked about how unfun the game was - three of them couldn't get past 3 hours. No one I knew liked the game except one die-hard fan who still agreed the combat was disgusting."
JRPG,3a7tdd,Jamaz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"That's precisely how the Sphere grid was as well.  A linear path with the occasional small deviation for a handful of stat points.  And if you wanted to build someone into a separate ""class,"" it was extremely expensive even during the post-game as you literally had to find very rare lock spheres and slog across the grid to someone else's.  Especially if you're going from something like Yunas grid to Wakka's grid which is on the complete opposite side of the board."

There's a group of fans that extremely dislike this deviation from the old style and declare all the new games are shit, when they're anything but.

I'm afraid of a reimagining of FFVI that will somehow add a bunch of belt straps to Celes, give one too many scars to Locke, and spoon feed us who Shadow is.  FFVI is my favourite in the series but the 2D game has aged well and doesn't need a remake. I'd be okay if it was just a remake that made the game fit in HD (maybe with slight touch ups to the maps).  Also, I hope it's ""Espers"" and not ""Eidolons"". Say what you well about a correct translation but I really like the old terms (though I'm not sure if ""eidolons"" was the correct translation or just a retroactive rebranding).  Anyway... FVII hasn't aged well so it's the perfect game for a remake."

JRPG,3a6t18,m00fire,4,Wed Jun 17 18:38:27 2015 UTC,"You're right too, I think I confused remaster and remake a bit there. For a more proper remake, I would love to see Illusions of Gaia"
JRPG,3a6t18,passmoreNOPE,-2,Wed Jun 17 18:42:49 2015 UTC,Nah bollocks to that.  Everyone who knows how to use a computer played FFXII HD about 10 years ago on an emulator.
JRPG,3a6t18,Azal8522,3,Wed Jun 17 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, taking into account that you meant a remaster. But I don't want it for the graphics. I'm hoping they still have the master audio files. The sound direction in this game is top notch. The voice acting is  incredibly well done, and it's a crime that all we got was a compressed mess so it would fit on a DVD.  Also, it'll give me a chance to play the zodiac job boards without having to emulate :)"
JRPG,3a6t18,kuury,2,Thu Jun 18 12:44:08 2015 UTC,"I just want the international version over here. It's a pain to get the right set up to play an imported version, and I'd rather play on modern consoles where it doesn't look silly on my TV."
JRPG,3a6t18,Spram2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"Sure, if they scrapped the entire story, the setting, the characters, and mechanics, it'd make a great remake! It's a very pretty game to look at."
JRPG,3a6t18,Ozwaldo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"I was playing the game the other day and I think this might not happen...  The game takes places in large areas divided into smaller segments, going from one segment to another makes the screen go black while the game loads the new area. This would look strange if the loading was faster since a lot of the areas are visible from the other areas so it would seem the loading is unnecessary. I don't think I explained this correctly, I suck at expressing myself which is why I have no job and everyone hates me, but trust me if they want to remake this game they would have to recreate all the areas as one big area since having it chopped up they way it was before just wouldn't work anymore.  I hate myself so much."
JRPG,3a6t18,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Thu Jun 18 00:22:37 2015 UTC,Spram2 you are the motherfucking man
JRPG,3a6t18,ffxivthrowaway03,8,Thu Jun 18 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, now that FF7 was announced the only other modern remaster/remake I'd like to see is FF9.  It fell into that weird end of PSX era where it didn't really get to shine like it could have."
JRPG,3a6t18,Daverost,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:35:05 2015 UTC,I think it would be weird to see them in a remake. The characters were purposely made to look deformed which fit the bill for the ps1 imo. I personally only played ix to about disc 3 if I recall because my little brother saved over my file :(
JRPG,3a6t18,ffxivthrowaway03,3,Wed Jun 17 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they couldn't do high definition versions of the original characters while holding to the original artistic flair.  It doesn't have to look hyper-realistic like FF13.  Just look at the prerendered cutscenes from FFIX, if the characters looked like that throughout the game I'd be more than content.  It's the in-engine graphics that haven't aged well really."
JRPG,3a6t18,Daverost,0,Wed Jun 17 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"You think so? To me, FF9 is grossly overhyped. I hated it and everyone else loves it. A bunch of people say it's their favorite FF or favorite RPG of all time.  I think it's gotten plenty of attention."
JRPG,3a6t18,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Wed Jun 17 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"Although it was a top-seller in Japan and America, Final Fantasy IX did not sell as well as Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VIII in either Japan or the United States.   A big part of its lesser sales was because it came out after the launch of the PS2.  There was a newfound focus on flashy graphics, and a lot of people overlooked it."
JRPG,3a6t18,Daverost,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"Those aren't really fair comparisons. FFVII and VIII sold like twice as many copies or better compared to every other FF game ever. Except X, which they still eclipse by a huge margin. IX still sold over 5 million copies or something."
JRPG,3a6t18,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"How is comparing it to the other FF games released on PSX not a fair comparison to make?  We're talking about games that should be remade/remastered, not the entirety of the Final Fantasy series.  But if you want to go down that road, the only two Final Fantasy games that have NOT been remade or remastered at this point are VIII and IX, and IX was the entry that got the least attention for a variety of reasons.  Also, your sales numbers are off.  FFIX has the lowest sales numbers out of not only the PSX-era Final Fantasies, but has the lowest sales of any main numbered title released since then.  It's hard to compare to I-VI sales because of all the remakes and multiplatform releases to take into account, but by now they've all more than likely outsold IX as well.  It's cool if you didn't enjoy it, but it's the most overshadowed entry in the series by far."
JRPG,3a6t18,Indoorsman,0,Thu Jun 18 12:40:01 2015 UTC,"It's not fair to compare FF9 to two of the best selling games of all time and pretend like it's the same thing. FF7 sold like hotcakes and FF8's sales rode on that wave of hype. Of course FF9 wouldn't sell as much as those two. Very few games have.  Regarding sales numbers, here they are directly from SE's mouth, in order of best to worst.  http://www.jp.square-enix.com/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200402090000-01.pdf#page=27  The data is from 2003, so only X and X-2 are on there after IX (with X-2 not even released overseas at the time) and X is probably well on its way toward 7 and 8's numbers by now. 7, 8, and 10 have all probably seen a big increase in sales recently with 7 and 8 on PSN/PC and 10 remastered on PS3/Vita. 9 is on PSN, too, but I don't know what it's done for the sales.  Either way, you're comparing it to two or three giants of gaming, and it's done amazingly well on its own. It still stands well above most games ever made. It's incredibly successful, no matter how you slice it."
JRPG,3a6t18,lionheart059,0,Thu Jun 18 13:37:22 2015 UTC,"FFVII and FFVIII are not two of the best selling games of all time, sorry.  Your average Call of Duty title moves over 20 million units worldwide.  And like I said, every main titled FF title since then has sold more too.  But none of that matters.  I never said the game was not successful, all I said was that it was a JRPG that was overshadowed by other things in the industry and has not aged well.  It's a game ripe for a remake/remaster at some point.  At this point you're picking a fight over absolutely nothing and cherry picking data to make a point about I don't even know what."
JRPG,3a6t18,7mad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:11:37 2015 UTC,It's a good game but it does a bad job of showing where the story goes in the end. The whole crystal out of nowhere and Necron was silly. Was next to no foreshadowing.   Memoria was dope as hell though. A place totally made of the most potent memories of the dead souls trapped inside is a cool idea. Seeing that in 3D and HD would be amazing.
JRPG,3a6t18,7mad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat... I finished it with everything because I'm a completionist, but I really don't see what the big deal was.  Most of my friends swear it's the best RPG ever, but I found it to be pretty mediocre at best."
JRPG,3a6t18,TYWM,7,Thu Jun 18 15:38:17 2015 UTC,Persona 2 no doubt. The gameplay and graphics does not do the Characters and story justice at ALL
JRPG,3a6t18,ACardAttack,2,Wed Jun 17 18:28:13 2015 UTC,Only played 3 and 4. 2 is that good?
JRPG,3a6t18,ACardAttack,5,Wed Jun 17 18:38:53 2015 UTC,VERY outdated with annoying and tedious gameplay. If you can get through that i suggest you atleast play the PSP versions cause the story and characters are to die for.
JRPG,3a6t18,flamearrestor,3,Wed Jun 17 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"They're very different games than the modern Persona games (3 and 4), but Persona 2: Innocent Sin and Persona 2: Eternal Punishment have incredible stories. I think the story of the Persona 2 duology is much stronger than 3 and 4's."
JRPG,3a6t18,ACardAttack,2,Wed Jun 17 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"2 is very good, I've only played the first half, there is Innocent Sin, and Eternal Punishment, IS was very good.  The graphics are okay, Story is awesome, but the contact system and how you go about creating new personas is tedious.  I'd suggest using a guide so you know how to best spend your time collecting monster cards."
JRPG,3a6t18,merph_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I forgot about P2!  I agree, loved the story, but hated the contact system.  Graphics didn't bother me so much"
JRPG,3a6t18,Kindara,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:30:42 2015 UTC,I'm still pretty choked Atlus didn't end up localizing the other half of P2 (Eternal Punishment). I mean... I still bought it as soon as they released the original version on the playstation store but it's not the same!
JRPG,3a6t18,ZeeBeckers,6,Fri Jun 19 07:36:37 2015 UTC,"Panzer Dragoon Saga!    After that, hard to find games, especially from the 32/64 bit area since those graphically have not aged well.  Chrono Cross could use some polishing with the story."
JRPG,3a6t18,gigantuar,3,Wed Jun 17 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see some of the older Tales games brought up to the graphical/gameplay level of the newer ones.  Like Symphonia, Destiny, Eternia, etc."
JRPG,3a6t18,Jabburo,6,Wed Jun 17 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"I know it's probably unnecessary, but maybe some of the old Tales games.  Namely Symphonia, Eternia, and Phantasia."
JRPG,3a6t18,Astolph,3,Wed Jun 17 18:48:26 2015 UTC,I don't know about Phantasia (which has had a slew of remakes already) but an updated Eternia would be amazing.

JRPG,3a6t18,MadHiggins,3,Thu Jun 18 06:45:33 2015 UTC,I'd like a remake of any PS1 rpg to be honest tho Xenogears is the first to come to mind. Maybe Chrono Cross? (It's beautiful already tho.) I just want to see them all in modern day graphics.
JRPG,3a6t18,sillykoalas,3,Wed Jun 17 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Persona 1 and 2 remade like Persona 3 and 4. I haven't played them yet, so I don't know if the stories could be adapted for social links, but even 3D graphics and new UI would be great."
JRPG,3a6t18,bladeraiden,2,Thu Jun 18 01:44:43 2015 UTC,Legend of Dragoon.
JRPG,3a6t18,TheRealBoyd,2,Wed Jun 17 22:35:32 2015 UTC,i'd love to see some remakes of game series that have kind of fallen to the wayside.  something like wild arms or breath of fire.  the remakes could kindle some sort of interest in new games in the series.
JRPG,3a6t18,GHNeko,2,Thu Jun 18 00:04:55 2015 UTC,Definitely the first 2 SMT games in the style of smt IV. Also have the SMT IV composer redo many of the games tracks as I personally don't enjoy those games soundtracks.
JRPG,3a6t18,migszxc,2,Thu Jun 18 02:36:40 2015 UTC,Legend of Legaia is what I hope for.

JRPG,3a6t18,FurbyTime,2,Sat Jun 20 20:15:29 2015 UTC,I think chrono trigger and cross would be great. I have always been a huge fan of the series.

The ""point per spell"" instead of MP and automatically missing an attack on an already dead enemy instead of targeting the next live one pretty much make it hard to go back.  Remakes aren't the same as HD remasters where you just get the same game but at a higher resolution."

JRPG,3a57lu,ethernetcord,16,Mon Jun 22 06:32:22 2015 UTC,"I bet they will use this as the final nail to establish Sephiroth as the main villain of FF VII when, within the game everything was pointing towards JENOVA being the villain."
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,10,Wed Jun 17 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well supposedly Jenova was being controlled by Sephiroth more than the other way around. Between VII and AV, she is more of a tool. They even use her genes pretty much solely as a link for the reunion.  Sephiroth didn't lose his mind because of the power, he used it for ""good"" before he found Gast's research. He made his own decisions."
JRPG,3a57lu,DotaLoveless,12,Wed Jun 17 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"And nowhere in the game is this ever mentioned, referred, or shown. Apart from once, by Hojo.   Everyone knows JENOVA has the abilities, but how Sephiroth has them is never explained until we got this retcon Ultimania Guide that tried to explain how Sephiroth suddenly could fly.  So, I fail to understand how Sephiroth could control JENOVA when it is clearly explained throughout the entire game that JENOVA can shapeshift and control minds, yet somehow we're supposed to believe Sephiroth managed to gain all these abilities, never explained in the game, but required other games and media to explain this?  Heck, remember that anime that came with Advent Children? Remember in the original game how Cloud threw Sephiroth into the Reactor? In the anime he jumps in himself. Way to go retcon!"
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,7,Wed Jun 17 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"I never actually read the Ultimania or watched that anime. Have not played any of the spinoffs. Only watched Advent Children movie.  That was what I took away from Sephiroth's rants, Hojo's fusion, and the scenes regarding Gant/Aerith's mom.  Jenova just seemed like a mindless ball of instinct driven flesh to me, never once does she ever interact on her own accord. Even when they explain that Sephiroth had been in the Northern Crater the entire game, controlling Jenova and everyone with her genes.  Reunion was never about Jenova, it was about reuniting with Sephiroth."
JRPG,3a57lu,DotaLoveless,6,Wed Jun 17 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"JENOVA's body was locked in Nibleheim and her head was in Northern Crater, as Sephiroth took it and was thrown in the Lifesteam by Cloud.  The Reunion started from ShinRa's Office when Sephiroth killed ShinRa employees and JENOVA's body escaped. How is that possible when he's encased in ice? And how did he ever get the ability to control JENOVA?   The whole idea behind JENOVA is that she can control others, those who have her cells, which Sephiroth does. It is explained in various ways that JENOVA can control others and show visions to people.  JENOVA landed on the planet and wanted to destroy it and Sephiroth first goes all ""mother this, mother that"" and then is also hellbent on destroying it as JENOVA is the ruler of the planet.   Advent Children changed things, the anime changed things, the Ultimania Omega guide gave explanations not in the game to explain things that occur in the game, such as why Sephiroth did not recognize Cloud in Niblheim in the game (he was lying was their reason).  Facts are that in the game it is explained how JENOVA has the ability infect people with her cells and then control them and Sephiroth's abilities are never explained, yet we have to assume Sephiroth somehow gained her abilities after he won in a battle of wills. Sephiroth has a hatred for the Cetra, a race he never knew, but JENOVA was defeated by them.  To believe Sephiroth to be the villain in the game I find too farfetched and Square had to bring external resources to give an explanation as to why Sephiroth is the villain instead, therefore a retcon."
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,9,Wed Jun 17 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"The Reunion started from ShinRa's Office when Sephiroth killed ShinRa employees and JENOVA's body escaped. How is that possible when he's encased in ice? And how did he ever get the ability to control JENOVA?   Actually, Jenova broke itself out. The door was blown outward and when people saw the long sword sticking out of President Shinra, that is when they assumed Sephiroth broke Jenova out.  As you already know the Sephiorth you chase the entire game, is actually Jenova who has shaped itself into Sephiroth. You learn this when you defeat the Jenova boss in the Forgotten City.   Advent Children changed things, the anime changed things, the Ultimania Omega guide gave explanations not in the game to explain things that occur in the game, such as why Sephiroth did not recognize Cloud in Niblheim in the game (he was lying was their reason).           Well that was because it wasn't Cloud, it was Zack. Cloud's memories were twisted with Zack's and it is not until Cloud goes into a coma, that you learn he was one of the grunts in a Shinra uniform. That was all in the game.   Facts are that in the game it is explained how JENOVA has the ability infect people with her cells and then control them and Sephiroth's abilities are never explained, yet we have to assume Sephiroth somehow gained her abilities after he won in a battle of wills. Sephiroth has a hatred for the Cetra, a race he never knew, but JENOVA was defeated by them.   This was actually covered after the Northern Crater incident where Cloud hands over the Black materia. Explaining that it is his will that controlled not only him, but everything with Jenova's cells. Sephiroth's dip into the lifestream had increased his abilities, it is where he learned of Meteor/Holy, and the true nature of Jenova/Cetra.  This is all actually explained in the game. It's not a retcon, maybe it was just explained poorly or because it wasn't said more than once."
JRPG,3a57lu,DotaLoveless,3,Wed Jun 17 15:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, JENOVA did break out herself and killed the people in the ShinRa office, that was my point.  Actually, the part I am referring to was Cloud, because the party travelled to Niblheim where they met Sephiroth, This happened later in the game and wasn't a flashback.  Aside from that, Cloud was the one who threw Sephiroth into the  Lifestream. He was there, but he was not a SOLDIER.  Sephiroth's will is only ever mentioned once in the game by Hojo. Sephiroth's dip into the Lifestream is hardly ever referred to, apart from being shown in a flashback. His ""enhanced abilities"" is an assumption and never stated in the game, where it's stated left, right and centre that JENOVA has these abilities.  And he never learned the true nature of JENOVA / Cetra, because he deemed the Cetra to be evil and JENOVA to be the ruler of the planet. Unless you have information about the Cetra I don't, we both know that Sephiroth was wrong. He learned what JENOVA told him. That same JENOVA who can control her cells anywhere she wants, including those in Sephiroth."
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"Well actually, he talked about Jenova being betrayed by the Cetra from Gast's laboratory in the Shinra Mansion during the flashback. There was never once anything to indicate Jenova even said a word. The game just says he went insane and what people took from this is that Sephiroth was talking to himself. Or just hearing himself talk.  The only thing that ever confused me in the games and lead me to believe Jenova had a will of it's own was when the door to it's containment in the Nibelheim Reactor opened by itself."
JRPG,3a57lu,DotaLoveless,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth read / researched books stating that the Cetra were lazy and took the planet away from mother.   At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the promised Land and supreme happiness. But, those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life. They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without  giving back one whit in return! Those are your ancestors""   Please tell me where in the Shinra books it would state any of that?   ""Long ago, disaster struck this planet. Your ancestors escaped...  They survived because they hid. The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase. Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports.""   I don't think that's anywhere in the books either. Sacrificing the Cetra to save the Planet? Pretty sure Jenova wiped them out.  He goes on a rampage, goes into the reactor and tries to open the door, which doesn't open. He slashes Tifa and suddenly the door opens.   ""With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of the Planet.""   Where does he get this from?   You could assume that Sephiroth descended into madness on his own. Or Jenova could be doing this. After all, she can manipulate people. This is a fact stated in the game over and over again. Sephiroth was a swell guy all the way until he appeared in front of Jenova in the reactor and suddenly goes on a rampage and burns down a village?"
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"My memory might be weak on the book part, sorry about that. Though about Sephiroth losing his mind near Jenova, well what would you do if you saw your Mother's name on a door in a reactor where monsters were being made. A mother you were told died at birth."
JRPG,3a57lu,DotaLoveless,3,Thu Jun 18 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"IIRC it was explained in-game at some point that Sephiroth's being dropped into the pure mako of the reactor tied him somewhat to the lifestream, and this, added to his infusion with JENOVA cells, allowed him to control other JENOVA cells (or people infused with them), which is why all of the failed experiments were drawn to him and why he made various pieces of JENOVA's body (including her head, which escaped from ShinRa on its own in his guise) take his likeness. This is not to mention the fact that it is shown in-game that he spends years holed up in the ShinRa mansion, reading all of the research ever conducted there, so if there were other ways to control those body parts written somewhere in there, he'd know it. It seemed pretty clearly laid out in the game that, while once the ultimate villain, JENOVA and her cells are now just pawns being used by Sephiroth in his vengeance against those who created him."
JRPG,3a57lu,WallyTheWalrus42,7,Wed Jun 17 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"It was JENOVA's body which escaped. JENOVA's head was in the Lifestream with Sephiroth. Prior to that JENOVA had been stuck in Northern Crater for about 2000 years.  The ""research"" he reads is completely wrong though! He reads that JENOVA is his mother and that she's the ruler of the planet and that the Cetra are evil. Please tell me that you don't believe this to be in the books he's reading. He's either being manipulated by JENOVA (who's in Niblheim where he first encountered her before he went mad), or he's the world's dumbest researcher.  As for controlling the JENOVA cells being in the books is pure speculation. We know JENOVA controlls her cells. Yet, we must believe Sephiroth somehow managed to gain this ability without there ever being an explanation in the game.  Like I mentioned, Sephiroth's will is only talked about once, by Hojo."
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth being the one in control was alluded via the Sephiroth clones, who rave about Sephiroth rather than Jenova if you talk to them. Jenova could shapeshift to any form, but always appears as Sephiroth, suggesting the being represents Sephiroth's will more than Jenova's. Whether it makes sense Sephiroth would be able to take over Jenova is another thing of course. Jenova was weakened though, its cells scattered about the world, and Sephiroth had a hold of its head when he fell into the Lifestream."
JRPG,3a57lu,satsumaclementine,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"Advent Children is not VII though. I am talking about what happens in VII, what is a fact in VII vs. what is conjecture in VII.  Edit: I realised you were talking about the clones in the game. These clones, however, were Sephiroth clones whom had Jenova cells in them. Just because they say Sephiroth, doesn't mean it is Sephiroth who's calling them. Even if Jenova was under Sephiroth's command, it would be Jenova calling them. Jenova, however, is flying around like Sephiroth.  Jenova can shapeshift and was guiding the Sephiroth clones which contain her cells (this includes Cloud) towards the Northern Crater where her head is.  Cloud is somewhat resilient, but one thing he wants is to get his hands on Sephiroth, so what better way to take on Sephiroth's guise which has affected so many lives and lure Cloud towards the Northern Crater to complete her Reunion?"
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth is indifferent whether Cloud makes it to the ""Reunion"" or not. He says ""come to the Reunion"" once in the Shinra Manor, but the reason he was there is not because he is leading Cloud anywhere, but Cloud was drawn to him subconsciously anyway and thus kept on his trail. Initially Sephiroth (or Jenova's body transformed into Sephiroth) is on a quest to find the Black Materia. Dio tells Cloud that Sephiroth asked him about the Black Materia, so Jenova assumes Sephiroth's form even when Cloud is nowhere near. Once he learns it is in the Temple of the Ancients he heads there, and from there he goes straight to North Crater. Once Sephiroth got the Black Materia he didn't yet know he'd need Cloud to deliver it to his true body in the end. Once Jenova's body is defeated and he loses the Black Materia, he sees a use for Cloud again. After that he doesn't try to bring Cloud to the ""Reunion"" again because he already accomplished his goal.  What I think more shows that Sephiroth is in control is that Jenova's body doesn't summon the Meteor with the Black Materia, it needs to be taken to the real Sephiroth. Why would Sephiroth even need a new body if it is Jenova who matters?   The clones used to be normal people before injected with J-cells by Hojo. Since then they have regressed into mumbling incoherent people who want to dress in robes and talk about Sephiroth calling to them. Being injected with J-cells manifesting as behaviour like this doesn't really make sense unless Sephiroth had control over beings with J-cells."
JRPG,3a57lu,satsumaclementine,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth is indifferent to everything, he's cocooned in Northern Crater. Jenova, however, wants to complete her body and that's the whole point of the Reunion. Cloud has Jenova cells, thus she wants Cloud at the Reunion. What better way to get him there by using Sephiroth's visage? You said it yourself, he's drawn to him.  I don't remember Sephiroth saying that in the flashback at Nibelheim, so if it was said anywhere after, it was Jenova. Cloud states at some point that they've been following Jenova all along.  Cloud states, after fighting Jenova-DEATH:   Jenova's cells..."" ""...hmm. So that's what this is all about."" ""The Jenova Reunion...""   To which Tifa replies:   ""Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?""   Cloud realises that they've been following Jenova all along and it has been about the Reunion all along. Why Jenova-DEATH doesn't use Meteor is never stated in the game. Jenova-DEATH is, however, not her complete version. If I were to speculate, I'd say Jenova isn't strong enough to summon Meteor in that state, or Jenova is incapable of using Materia, seeing as Materia is made from Mako and Mako comes from the Lifestream which rejects Jenova, therefore she needs Sephiroth's body, or his will to summon Meteor.   Sephiroth: Now...what does Mako energy became when it's further condensed?""  Cloud: ""Uh, ummm...... Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia.""   Dio did say he met Sephiroth, however, Sephiroth (or Jenova, doesn't matter for this point) killed everyone in the ShinRa HQ and travelled towards the cargo ship, killed Midgar Zolom and on the cargo ship killed the people on there as well, yet Dio somehow isn't brutally murdered, or reported any attack.  Heck, later when you talk to him:   Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had a 'Black Materia.'""          ""I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age.""   Cloud ""Did he happen to have... a Black Cape...""   Dio ""Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.""    Dio saw a Sephiroth clone, not the actual Sephiroth, as he's in Northern Crater the entire time, apart from when you see him in flashbacks.  As for the clones, they were subjected to huge amounts of Mako and Jenova cells. Remember what happened to Cloud when he fell into the Lifestream? As for why they're rambling Sephiroth? Seeing as all the Sephiroth clones were the suvivors from the Nibelheim incident and Jenova is going round in Sephiroth's visage and calling all her cells to come back to her and she's doing it in the most effective way she knows, to once again quote Ifalna:   ""It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.""   Jenova reads the people who have her cells and she sees one thing everyone has in common with each other, Sephiroth. The clones were Nibelheim survivors of Sephiroth's attack. Cloud has a long history with Sephiroth. Tell me how Jenova controls Sephiroth and tries to control Cloud, but not Vincent or Cid? Jenova cells.  Facts are that Jenova is going round the world pretending to be Sephiroth. Jenova has the powers to fly, manipulate, control and shapeshift. The Reunion is something which is actually happening which is what Jenova is all about, she can combine her body again as her body is never going to be accepted by the Lifestream due to her being alien."
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:47:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know, why doesn't Jenova just ""reunite"" with Cloud the first time they meet then? What the Reunion is supposed to be is never so clearly explained in the game I guess, because when you get to Whirlwind Maze you see Sephiroth just slaying all the clones, or the clones toppling over and dying on their own.  Cloud does realize that they've been following Jenova all along, but I think he interprets it as Sephiroth having tricked them into following an imposter, because next he says that Sephiroth's true body is nearby and that he can feel it. Jenova's body at this point is destroyed. Jenova being unable to use Materia I hadn't considered. It drops the Ifrit Materia and the Destruct Materia, but that's about what is shown with it and normal Materia.  Dio saw two people who both asked him about the Black Materia. If he thought the Black Cape was Sephiroth, he would not have described him as ""a boy your age"", he would described him as ""Sephiroth"". The second person he saw he specifically says was ""Sephiroth"". It is in the letter he leaves with the buggy, I think.   That's an interesting theory about the clones. The people who become ""Black Capes"" lose their minds and operate on instinct rather than consciously, and thus I don't think they need to be tricked by visions. The ones who do keep their senses, like Cloud and the 2nd floor Weapon Shop owner in Junon, can override the instinct for the Reunion somewhat, but it still influences them. (The weapon shop owner starts dressing like a Black Cape but still operates the shop there till the end of the game and speaks normally o_O). There is one person in the game we see as before becoming a ""Black Cape"", the man in the pipe in Sector 5. Cloud doesn't say anything about recognising him from being from Nibelheim, so who knows what that guy's story was in the end.  Sephiroth can't control Vincent or Cid because they have never been injected with J-cells.  It has been officially addressed that Sephiroth is the one who controls Jenova and not the other way around, and I think the ""word of god"" version overall makes better sense in the game since Sephiroth is treated as the main villain and Jenova as a secondary villain, him being the final boss before Jenova SYNTHESIS and all. I'm somewhat curious how Jenova will be depicted in the remake, if she will have any more ""personality"" or not."
JRPG,3a57lu,satsumaclementine,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:06:33 2015 UTC,"Because Cloud is resistant, Cloud resisted slashing Aerith for instance. The reunion is the Jenova cells gathering together. It has been stated that Jenova will always remain, as long as her body remains, or even cells of her. The Reunion is Jenova completing her body and making it whole again.  For the last time, every instance where you see Sephiroth, it is Jenova. Sephiroth is in his Mako cocoon in Northern Crater, not moving. The only other time you see Sephiroth is in the flashbacks. So the ""Sephiroth"" you see killing off the clones is Jenova. The line spoken is also ""I have no more use of this body"", which can be interpreted in multiple ways, but could be interpreted that Jenova no longer needs these clones.  Cloud does say that, but he says the following line:   ""He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here."" ""It's both incredibly wicked and cruel... But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within the planet's wound.""   Why does Cloud suddenly refer to Sephiroth as... it? And no, you still fight Jenova later when you fight Jenova-SYNTHESIS and Bizarro Sephiroth also has two heads.  It is never mentioned in the game that Dio saw two Sephiroths. He says in a letter he saw Sephiroth and when you speak to him he confirms that it had a tattoo with #1 on his hand.  This same number is repeated a few times throughout the game. Regardless, Jenova killed everything every time she appeared somewhere as Sephiroth yet Dio reports no attack. Why? Because it was a clone, not Jenova as Sephiroth.  And correct, this is why Cloud was always forced into handing the Black Materia. At some point in the game, Cloud gives it to RED XIII, or Barrett and then later asks for it and gets it back and promptly puts it inside Sephiroth's cocoon. Once again though, you say Sephiroth cannot control Vincent or Cid, because they have never been injected with Jenova cells, but at what point do you see Sephiroth ever control anybody with Jenova cells? He certainly did not control Zack in Nibelheim in the flashback, but we're told that Jenova can when we look at the tapes of Gast and Ifalna. When did Sephiroth started to control Jenova, because it is never mentioned in the game.   It has been officially addressed that Sephiroth is the one who controls Jenova   Yes, in sources that came out afterwards. The Ultimania Omega Guide was released years after the release of the game. Plus with all the other retcons, it is not surprised they have come out and said something was ""intended"" a certain way. Heck, in Crisis Core Genesis tells Sephiroth about his history in the ShinRa mansion, this is never shown in the game at all!"
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,2,Fri Jun 19 12:58:17 2015 UTC,I thought one of the cool things of the game was the mystery of who was the real mastermind.
JRPG,3a57lu,Julliant,3,Wed Jun 17 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"2 way street imo. I mean you kill Jenova once and for all in the end dungeon but even after Sephy is still doing his own thing.  Jenova pushed him to insanity, and manipulated him but it was a mutually beneficial relationship which he didn't need anymore in the end.  At some point Sephiroth was surely working off of his own motivations but it didn't matter because this was still part of Jenova's grand design."
JRPG,3a57lu,Purest_Prodigy,2,Wed Jun 17 19:40:45 2015 UTC,"I thought it had a charm as well, but when I replayed the game and things didn't make sense and I started talking to friends we saw how it was a lot more plausible for JENOVA to be the villain, as opposed to Sephiroth and when I checked online there were others saying the same thing."
JRPG,3a57lu,ahipotion,14,Wed Jun 17 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone is so demanding with this remake. ""I just want this..."" ""I just want that...""   Look, it's a no-win from Square. If you're THAT worried about tainting the original version, guess what? You STILL have the original version to play and enjoy. Listening to millions of fans and trying to figure a direction for the game will be nightmarish and flat out impossible.   Personally, I'm open to whatever they want to do. Knowing Square, I know that Story takes precedent over all facets. Advent Children made it clear as to how they intended the story to go. I'm sure they'll want it to tie in altogether. And, even if it's not my ""ideal"" version, I'm completely happy with that."
JRPG,3a57lu,fly2me,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"If you're THAT worried about tainting the original version, guess what? You STILL have the original version to play and enjoy.   The original version's graphics aged poorly, and there were some minor mechanics (e.g. absence of ""always run"") that make it somewhat annoying to play today. But the story and mechanics don't need any changes."
JRPG,3a57lu,blacktrance,3,Wed Jun 17 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"One can make a similar argument that the gameplay mechanics also didn't age well. Some don't like the original version where you sit and choose actions and items from a menu in that fashion. (Personally, I love it) Story could also be more developed to tie in further concepts and flesh it out more. There is also the ultimate guide that was released ages ago, providing more detaisl that didn't make it into the game.  Regardless, too many people went from hyped to , ""oh no that's not what I want."" If you browse most discussions about this game, you'll see the number one comment is ""I just want"" or ""I just don't want"". Have a little faith that the creator's will do it justice. After all, it is something that they created. I wouldn't want GRRM to change ASOIAF because of what the fans wanted. As long as they don't pull a Lost, I'll be happy revisiting the world and seeing their updated interpretation."
JRPG,3a57lu,fly2me,0,Wed Jun 17 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"Have a little faith that the creator's will do it justice.   Considering Square's track record in the past 10 years, that faith would be unwarranted."
JRPG,3a57lu,blacktrance,2,Wed Jun 17 22:13:49 2015 UTC,"I was speaking for the original creators' of the series, not the top management with their questionable business decisions that have led them to where they're at today as a company. The production team of VII proved overwhelmingly successful as it contributed heavily to putting SE at the top. Project has now committed to and will backed with appropriate funding. Top management can work on overseeing project management, milestones, marketing, and logistics. I don't need to base it on their track record in the past 10 years. I have to look at the whole picture. They're moving the right direction now. XIV is a great example that speaks to that."

JRPG,3a57lu,_Ritual,14,Wed Jun 17 12:34:31 2015 UTC,It's really the only reason to go back to the original now.   Hope they don't fuck it up
JRPG,3a57lu,blazecc,11,Wed Jun 17 12:50:38 2015 UTC,"The problem was that it wasn't intricate.  It was good in theory but was poorly implemented. Added effects didn't always work as you'd expect, for instance. And Magic was almost completely useless throughout the game (very few elemental weaknesses, normal attacks almost always did more) so there wasn't much of a point.  They can keep the materia system but if they leave it as is, it's going to be very disappointing. There is so much more they could do with it."
JRPG,3a57lu,mysticrudnin,3,Wed Jun 17 13:13:40 2015 UTC,"I am sure that they will add more materia and open up new possibilities. They have never done a full blown remake before, so no reason why they would not add new content."

Whether or fun or not is not at issue, it's whether the system is relevant to modern game-making, and the fact is that the ATB system (at least in its old, 90s form) is completely irrelevant to designing a game for the PS4. They are going to change it, that is pretty much a given, it's just what they change it to that is more in question. Will it be more like XIII, trying to mix action and the ATB system? Will it be more action-y? Will there even be battle screens? Who knows."

One thing I am curious about though is the random encounters. I wonder if they will actually show the enemy before you encounter it like FFXIII or tales games. Random encounters are outdated. I'd still be okay with it, but I do see this being changed.  Also, I'm super excited to see a world map. I hope they do a full scale world map. That would be amazing."
JRPG,3a57lu,Pavetheway,3,Wed Jun 17 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like they might tweak ATB a little so you never have that moment of ""now to wait for someone's gauge to fill so something can happen""."

They just want FF7, with redone graphics, gameplay balances, and some nice polish/extended features like new materia/additional bosses.  If you go ahead and make a completely different game with a real-time combat system or whatever is making modern JRPGs a mindless slog these days, you may as well not bother."
JRPG,3a57lu,rowe92,25,Wed Jun 17 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"See, that's not really true. New gameplay would be great, the old school ATB system is highly outdated and would just drag a modern game down. They could do so much more with a remake, making combat even more fun and interesting. Something like XIII has, or something even better, would be great.  However, changing the story in unneeded ways is bad. I hope that what Nomura meant by ""more work"" into the story just means that it will be a bit more fleshed out, expanded on, and improved, rather than actually altered. Add more dialogue, make certain parts take longer or be more in depth, etc. They could go a lot more in-depth in a lot of places and it would be great, but hopefully they don't cut anything or change anyone's personality. That would blow."
JRPG,3a57lu,WallyTheWalrus42,23,Wed Jun 17 15:14:56 2015 UTC,7's combat was vastly superior to 13's... 13 tried to be Star Ocean without actually letting you control your positioning (but still made positioning relevant so you just get to pray lol).  If they give me Star Ocean's combat I could be ok with a change but none of that 13 nonsense.
JRPG,3a57lu,rglitched,3,Wed Jun 17 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"I never said to copy XIII's system, or that it was perfect or even ideal. I only said that something similar to XIII's would be better, and I stand by it. But really, the main point was that ATB is outdated and the remake should move combat into the future. The core aspects of the game should remain unchanged, anything else would hurt the remake. ATB is not core IMO, any battle system would do, and many would do it much better. Keep the story as intact as possible, don't cut content, but please improve combat: that is my hope."
JRPG,3a57lu,WallyTheWalrus42,2,Thu Jun 18 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm all for some change too. Materia as a backend is flexible and they could use it in a hundred completely different systems so I hope they keep it whatever they do.  If they're going to copy anything:  Star Ocean Star Ocean Star Ocean Star Ocean Star Ocean Star Ocean Star Ocean.  Hands down, bar none, zero competitors for best JRPG combat.   It'd be true whether I picked 2 or 4 as my example too (haven't played others).   'Tales of' can have an honorable mention but is ultimately inferior because of the weird 'toward or away' movement lock system instead of free move. I know you can drain your stamina bar and hold a key to free move but why the hell should I have to when it adds irritation instead of depth?  I'd take a Dragon's Dogma style too - Which is basically what all the 'offline MMO' styled JRPGs are doing lately but without the compromise to classic JRPG style (full action instead of the weird pseudo-active style used in FFXIII), which it's better for."
JRPG,3a57lu,rglitched,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a more action rpg system would be best IMO, but it could go many ways. I doubt they will flat copy any system, but most things would be an improvement over the ATB, so long as magic and abilities are still based on Materia."
JRPG,3a57lu,WallyTheWalrus42,5,Thu Jun 18 01:40:04 2015 UTC,13 tried to be Star Ocean without actually letting you control your positioning (but still made positioning relevant so you just get to pray lol).   Ugh that's what pissed me off the most about the ff13 battle system.
JRPG,3a57lu,Zuckerriegel,8,Wed Jun 17 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I played VII and XII at launch and would much rather the battle system from XIII. Once it opens up (albeit too far into the game), I found it far more engaging and strategic.   Not saying VII's was bad but it's definitely dated in my opinion. Last thing I want is to watch summon animations over and over again."
JRPG,3a57lu,goldenvile,3,Wed Jun 17 17:04:31 2015 UTC,Animations != Combat System though. 13's was a half-assed version of something readily available to copy (and that SquareEnix is the publisher for too!) so it irritates me to no end that they did what they did with it. Keep 7 or go full Star Ocean. 13 is the middle ground with the worst of both worlds.
JRPG,3a57lu,rglitched,7,Wed Jun 17 17:07:42 2015 UTC,I disagree. 13 was a lot of fun and had a good balance of action and thinking. Quick thinking.

JRPG,3a57lu,starlizzle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:12:00 2015 UTC,My main gripe with FF13 was only being able to control a single character. I remember levelling materia in FF7 and I couldn't fucking wait to see the animations and effects on my new spells as well as how much damage they did. FF13 was justb a mess of particle effects and things exploding and none of the attacks felt that powerful.
JRPG,3a57lu,m00fire,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"Quick thinking, it was setup a few flexible paradigm groups and swap back and forth.

JRPG,3a57lu,Indoorsman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:50:53 2015 UTC,13-2 did improve a lot of things. What I like about 13's combat system is that it actually feels hard. You really have to master the rhythm and switch to the proper paradigms.  In 7 the only parts that gave me trouble was when I got underleveled towards the end because of how easily I just blew past everything. I had to spend about 5 hours grinding to a little above the proper level for the final fight.
JRPG,3a57lu,simsoy,-1,Thu Jun 18 02:16:03 2015 UTC,I agree. Real time choices versus 7's slog.
JRPG,3a57lu,starlizzle,5,Wed Jun 17 17:45:49 2015 UTC,I'm playing XIII right now and asides from hallway-simulator the other thing really bringing down the experience is the combat.  Controlling one character and auto-battle is incredibly bland.

JRPG,3a57lu,camlawson24,3,Wed Jun 17 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"Of course they did, and they liked the cinematic as well, and the story, and the characters, and everything. That doesn't change the fact that all these systems will be 20 years old when the remake comes out, though, and there have been tons of innovations. FF7 was groundbreaking atm, and the remake would only be hurting itself if it wasn't just as groundbreaking (while retaining the key aspects, like story and setting) mechanically. Improving combat doesn't hurt the plot in any way, all it can possibly hurt is the nostalgia factor that can be easily cured by playing the original in all its old-fashioned glory."
JRPG,3a57lu,WallyTheWalrus42,-2,Thu Jun 18 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"you liked the gameplay mechanics when they came out and it was new and innovative and exciting. now you like them because of the nostalgia of how you felt back then, which is great. but the problem is that today, that game system would not sell well. there is a reason that outside of Japan the jrpg market has been.. not very active.   They have to not only sell to the nostalgia buyers, but also for the people who are getting to experience the world and story for the first time. many of them will not sit through a game with that combat system because it feels ancient and they don't have that nostalgia factor to make them love it.   which is more important? people experiencing the story of ff7, or having to play with ATB for authenticity sake?"

And I didn't say ""copy FFXIII combat into this,"" I just said something more like what it has. There are plenty of better ways to approach combat in an RPG. FFXIII's is, arguably, more interesting. Western RPGs like Dragon Age have much more fun (to me) combat systems while still maintaining a party setup, and Crisis Core, while only a single character, had a much more fun and active battle system.   The golden age of FF, and JRPGs in general, was ATB out of necessity. There weren't really viable alternatives with the available technology, their are vastly better alternatives now. ATB is a thing of the past and should stay there."

I'm going to be pretty disappointed if things like the Honey Bee Inn, Don Corneo, and the level-gaining Highwind Pilot are removed from the game because they now don't fit the ""tone"" of the world as it has evolved since the initial release."

I don't envy SquareEnix right now. They are in a damned if we do, damned if we don't stage right now. They have to sell this to modern gamers, which don't want a ~20 year old game with pretty graphics. They want a game that they can relate to as well. But older gamers want that Nostalgia of when they played it originally but also with updated visuals (any one that says they'd prefer characers more blocky than minecraft are drunk).  If I was SquareEnix, I wouldn't have touched it. I think they are absolutely insane for doing so, but soooo excited for it at the same time."

JRPG,3a57lu,deffsight,3,Wed Jun 17 12:51:17 2015 UTC,This is most likely it.  I'm thinking they'll add some extra sequences and such that tie in Before Crisis/Crisis Core plotlines to give a modern player the full picture.  Expecting a player these days to go back and play three/four other old games to get the whole picture is just unrealistic.

JRPG,3a519x,inapt888,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:56:54 2015 UTC,Same. I thought revisiting Roak with the original SO1 battle music and the whole Alternate Earth thing were amazing. The story was kinda weak compared to 3 and Lymle was a fucking retard but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

JRPG,3a519x,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Wed Jun 17 14:34:26 2015 UTC,It wasn't that bad.
JRPG,3a519x,Mossmanx,4,Wed Jun 17 15:57:14 2015 UTC,Oh yeah the character and story was the only shitty part about the game. Played it with the Japanese dub and the gameplay and graphics were superb!
JRPG,3a519x,7mad,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:53:49 2015 UTC,Lymle gets a bad rap but she was actually one of the more interesting characters of the series imo. I was understanding of her oddness since her mind was essentially shattered from a summoning gone wrong.
JRPG,3a519x,Sighto,3,Thu Jun 18 17:11:19 2015 UTC,She wasn't as bad as the loli catgirl. The characters in that game were embarrassing.

But I have never seen anything concrete to substantiate the rumors.    Seems kinda iffy to me though when I think about how great 1, 2, and 3 are.  Then after Square and Enix merge, we get 4...    And people wonder why I hate English dubs of Japanese games...  I like to point them to shit like Lymle, and Vanille."
JRPG,3a519x,Zilveari,3,Thu Jun 18 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Vanille? That's surprising. I think she is one of the most sincere dubbed VO in that game. Her crying ""what do you want from me?"" To Sahz is so sincere it makes all other points moot imo."
JRPG,3a519x,rickimatsu,2,Fri Jun 19 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of people hated vanille because her character archetype is a strictly japanese archetype, and her mannerisms simply do not localize well as there is no western equivalent to that archetype so most of it just comes out really awkward and out of place.

I think the person who said the gameplay was mediocare was right, but man, the rest of the game more than made up for it.  And the game wasn't terrible, but as someone who played through initially on hard, let me advise anyone who hasn't played the game:  don't do that.  All they did was give the bosses more hp, so everything takes longer.  That's not.  Not anymore interesting and the gameplay isn't best part, so I say play it on normal."

Amazing.) but the only one I could find, had lyrics with it, too.  Which is cool, I like it too, but I wanted to find a just-piano version."

JRPG,3a26a4,operationrudeboy,0,Wed Jun 17 05:10:01 2015 UTC,Yeah there is. There is a reason both Sony and Square were saying Play it first on PS4 and not play exclusively. Sony would have said exclusively if they could have.

JRPG,3a26a4,kariudo,30,Wed Jun 17 08:16:26 2015 UTC,Did square enix tease me with Chrono Trigger Music and then not deliver a Chrono product?  Yes.  Yes they did.
JRPG,3a26a4,BTMPL,6,Tue Jun 16 18:45:22 2015 UTC,No offense to the ff7 fans... But chrono trigger would have had me actually excited.

JRPG,3a26a4,NotARobotv2,7,Tue Jun 16 17:25:56 2015 UTC,Didn't get too far into NieR. Guess I'll have to pick it up again because I definitely didn't see this coming.

JRPG,3a26a4,outcastded,6,Tue Jun 16 17:32:03 2015 UTC,and finish it again... and again for those plot twists!
JRPG,3a26a4,arof,3,Tue Jun 16 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the original, so I just checked out some reviews. Most said that the game was mediocre. The side quests apparently are boring, graphics/design  boring, and the game drags out. At least that's the impression that I'm left with. And also, that it has a great story. But if I play it for the story I would want to get through the game play quickly. Is that possible?"
JRPG,3a26a4,Cuzit,5,Tue Jun 16 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"Not a popular thing to do but if the save files are set to be copyable you can use a tool to modify existing hacked save files with max stats/items/etc to work on your console, or if those don't exist a lot of games have ways to edit your own save files. Basically console cheats. You lose a lot of the nuance that went into the gameplay design (fans always forgive these sorts of weaknesses) though, but it's a way to get to the story faster. I'd give it a try for at least a short while yourself to see your own opinion before going this route though.  Edit: Assuming PS3, save editing on 360 I think requires an actual hacked console."
JRPG,3a26a4,outcastded,3,Tue Jun 16 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust reviews. I wouldn't say Nier is my favorite game ever, to be honest, but I had a lot of fun with it; I think it's a good game, overall. It's not really what appeals to the mainstream as much, though, which is my best guess at why it was reviewed so poorly. I mean, one reviewer gave the game a zero out of ten because he couldn't figure out the fishing game. Admittedly, the game (probably a mistranslation) doesn't tell you exactly what to do, but the only time you're forced to do it the game continues anyway if you fail three times, which takes like 30 seconds. So... don't trust reviews. Maybe you'll like it, maybe not, but just give it a go."

JRPG,3a26a4,BTMPL,2,Wed Jun 17 04:27:30 2015 UTC,"yeah, you can play the game on easy if you want the story and beat it without much trouble. there are a couple of annoying parts but you can mostly button mash and get through it fairly easily."

""No fucking way, that has to be something else""  ""Right?""  ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT ACTUALLY SAYS NIER ON THE SCREEN""  I can't even express how excited I am. Nier is easily in my top 3 favorite games of all time.

Not until I saw the title did I even remotely imagine a NieR sequel.  I cannot wait to hear more of this!"

Sony can have all of my monies. That being said, I'm a bit worried about how Platinum Games will handle NieR, as much as I love the action in their games, they're usually pretty light and nonsensical on the story side. But I guess that's what Taro Yoko is there for."
JRPG,3a26a4,Gmr_Leon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:25:17 2015 UTC,"Well keep in mind that Platinum was basically born from the ashes of Clover Studio, who did Okami.

JRPG,3a26a4,RNGmaster,2,Wed Jun 17 08:45:03 2015 UTC,the game is confirmed to be set sometime after nier. some characters from the first game would reappear but not in major roles (see [here]http://dokidokikusoge.moe/post/121729261991/new-nier-details-from-this-weeks-famitsu) ). so with that it's basically confirmed that it's a new character and that this game will mostly be about a new cast.

JRPG,3a26a4,RNGmaster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:13:20 2015 UTC,"I understand where they're coming from. I keep seeing praise for Nier's music but all I remember is the choral music in dungeons that got really, really, really repetitive. It just wasn't for me."
JRPG,3a26a4,bureburebure,2,Tue Jun 16 19:26:22 2015 UTC,"The foundation of his music and the way he composed it was absolutely inspiring but it didn't work well when repeated I agree. He will probably learn as a composer from the original NieR and may not include as many vocals for the open world and/or dungeons this time round because I feel having vocals can really make things sound repetitive sometimes, mainly because of how distinctive they are. If you listen to the track Grandma, it's pretty much one melody on piano repeated but you could listen to it for hours. Funny how video game music works :)."
JRPG,3a26a4,RNGmaster,0,Tue Jun 16 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"I listen to a wide variety of game music composers (we're talking in the 100s), and am positive about most of them.  However, there's a small handful (less than 10!) that is praised to no end, even though their music lacks any real substance. Okabe is one of them. Nice sound production, but the same chord progressions and predictable melodies over and over."
JRPG,3a26a4,bureburebure,2,Tue Jun 16 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"What are the others you dislike?  I'd say the strength of the Nier soundtrack is the atmosphere. The more ambient pieces are generally my favorite. (Oh, and the vocal melody of Emil/Karma makes me tear up so hard)"

JRPG,3a4qfw,yoshi314,4,Wed Jun 17 13:18:42 2015 UTC,"I think this has been discussed the day before FF7 remake was officially announced on the top comments on reddit . Theres a reason why its called a ""remake "" instead of a ""Remaster "" . I hope the developers remains faithful to the game but I also understand you can't follow exactly everything from the original .  its the same concept as adapting a novel into a movie , fans of the original would hate it if you script out even one sentence from the book but newcomers would definitely feel a breath of fresh air and probably buy the book to get into it more ."

JRPG,3a4qfw,Ardailec,2,Wed Jun 17 09:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those might look dumb with realistic characters. The one thing I'm truly rooting for is that they keep the dialogues the same or mostly the same. Dialogue quality took a huge dive since FF XIII, for some reason it became amateurishly pretentious and that tone would absolutely decimate Final Fantasy VII. Wutai and Dyne's scenarios would be completely ruined if the characters talked like Lightning or Serah."

JRPG,3a42pj,Sandbucketman,3,Wed Jun 17 18:53:17 2015 UTC,"this isn't the tweet, but it is the image they tweeted confirming the summer release  http://i.imgur.com/uOEDkbO.png  Or at least, a tweet confirming the summer release."

JRPG,3a42pj,Rigo77,2,Wed Jun 17 19:13:07 2015 UTC,It's coming out before Trails of Cold Steel.
JRPG,3a42pj,Prophylaxis3,3,Wed Jun 17 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's a another game in the series. Trails In The Sky 2 is, as far as I know, also being localized by XSEED."
JRPG,3a42pj,Rigo77,5,Wed Jun 17 15:48:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I'm around 30 hours in trails in The sky and I'm loving it so far!

JRPG,3a2ga4,dertswa687o,24,Tue Jun 16 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"The game looks cool but seriously, fuck whoever edited that trailer."

JRPG,3a2ga4,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:35:35 2015 UTC,"At first I thought the video glitched, then I realized the horror I was seeing. 6 members is interesting, if battles are seamless I think that will be weird, Star Ocean environments are already very large oversized corridors and now they'll have to be even wider and more unnatural to fit battles into them.  What I really want to see is a deeper skills and crafting system like in SO2 and maybe battles like 4 but with more than 2 buttons to execute moves off of.  I already expect the story and characters to be cliche to hell and back but as long as the battle system is good I'll play it."
JRPG,3a2ga4,DifficultApple,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:34:21 2015 UTC,fuck whoever edited that trailer.   Why would you want to do that? That epic editing made me laugh quite hard.
JRPG,3a2ga4,DiluvialAscension,6,Wed Jun 17 02:40:32 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for the seamless world to combat and being able to have six people in your active party.  SO games always have such mechanically interesting characters when it comes to combat, and I hate getting a big cast of varied and interesting characters only to have them sit on the bench the whole game."
JRPG,3a2ga4,ffxivthrowaway03,3,Tue Jun 16 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"I've only played SO4, but I loved the combat in that game so much. Every character was really easy to pick up so I never really felt constricted to playing the main character like I sometimes do in Tales games. 6 active party members will be chaotic but it should be fun."
JRPG,3a2ga4,Symposia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're in for a treat if you play the others in series! The combat in SO4 was nice but it lacked in other areas.  There's a boss in SO3 with a powerful attack called 'Insanity Prelude' which essentially covers the entire battlefield aside from some small areas at the very edge. When he uses it you have to quickly get your 3 characters to these safe zones (and even then it's not guaranteed you'll dodge it in the PAL version!), so having to do it with 6 would be crazy! Looking forward to it though."
JRPG,3a2ga4,netherlight,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"I actually bought SO3 about 3 years ago and haven't gotten around to playing it yet. Too many games, so little time. I've seen some gameplay and it looks really fun."
JRPG,3a2ga4,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:53:15 2015 UTC,Oh no! You're missing out I think if you enjoyed combat. SO3 had the most interesting combat by a pretty large margin (though all of them are great). You should play!
JRPG,3a2ga4,netherlight,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:26:15 2015 UTC,"I've tried it, but the Rage meter was a pain to deal with. Any tips?"
JRPG,3a2ga4,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, the fury meter! I thought that was neat! A little like the rock-paper-scissors that you sometimes find in fighting games. What specifically was painful about it?  A summary:  It's basically stamina. As you attack, you expend it. If you stay still and do nothing, you recover it. Think of it like real life--after doing a bunch of slashes, you get winded, so you want to step back out of the action and take a breather. So generally you'll want to dive in and out of combat.  While it's full, you also get your anti-attack aura (aaa) and become invulnerable to weak (quick) attacks. (In fact you auto-stun him or something iirc.) However, a strong attack will break your guard, so if you see the enemy winding up, get out of the way. (I think there's this dark aura when enemies make strong attacks, and they're slow.)  So just view the fury meter as how tired you are. If you're getting low, you need to take a rest. If your enemy is low, then he can't attack very effectively, and that's your chance to de-stuffing him."
JRPG,3a2ga4,netherlight,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"It was always running out on me. I only really used weak attacks, but so often I would run out and be able to do nothing. Misses also really hurt in the game."
JRPG,3a2ga4,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:33:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, try backstepping to regen fury. And if your weak attacks aren't connecting, check that your enemy doesn't have a full fury meter. If so, use a strong attack instead."
JRPG,3a2ga4,EndSage,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:28:37 2015 UTC,How can I check the enemy's fury meter?
JRPG,3a2ga4,EndSage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:36:39 2015 UTC,"Do you recommend any JRPGs? My SO LOVED SO4, and is looking for another jrpg to play."
JRPG,3a2ga4,Harrason,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the Tales series. It has a similar action-based combat system as SO4. I'd recommend starting with Symphonia, Vesperia, Abyss, or Xillia."

JRPG,3a2ga4,isual,4,Thu Jun 18 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"I know this is a little irrelevant, but I am actually really liking the way all the characters follow you around.  It... makes you feel like you have an actual party around. And the combat includes every single character? Might be kind of chaotic and hard to execute, but I am really digging that."
JRPG,3a2ga4,fly2me,2,Tue Jun 16 18:48:31 2015 UTC,Yeah it was pretty cool. Gave me a FF8 flash back. Kid me thought that was so cool to see your whole party running behind Squall.
JRPG,3a2ga4,Symposia,3,Wed Jun 17 05:40:43 2015 UTC,"nice! another great reason for owning a ps4.  now, if they can only bring over DQ7 for 3ds. shietttt"

JRPG,3a2ga4,Walican132,2,Tue Jun 16 22:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, game looks nice but I've seen better editing! That shot on the beach is gorgeous. I'd pre-order now if I could.  6 person battles will be pretty intense. I like the seamlessness they've added, but I wonder if it'll make avoiding battles more difficult?"

JRPG,3a2ga4,fanboy_killer,2,Tue Jun 16 20:41:29 2015 UTC,They did say when they announced it that they were 40% done at the time.

JRPG,3a2ga4,Daverost,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:20:25 2015 UTC,"I've played all the Star Ocean games and I love them, but is this not the worst title for a video game of all time?"
JRPG,3a2ga4,papadoc03,0,Wed Jun 17 07:51:55 2015 UTC,"Aw man, I was really hoping it would also get a PS3 release here, since the ps4 version is only a port of the ps3 version.  Star Ocean 5, The Last Guardian, and Dragon Quest Heroes being on PS4 and not PS3, really cheeses me off."
JRPG,3a2ga4,Hexatona,2,Tue Jun 16 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"Granted, it's been over a year and a half since PS4's launch. You can't really keep clinging to PS3, which is over 8.5 years old. At some point, the majority of games are going to shift to current gen instead of last- or cross-gen. We're pretty much at that point. These games won't even be out here until PS4 is 2-3 years old.  I know it's not what you want to hear, but if you want to keep gaming, you're going to have to pony up for a new console."
JRPG,3a2ga4,Daverost,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:40:30 2015 UTC,Good points. Japan seems to stick with older consoles longer (see PSP) but the US only gives them about a year or so before a full shift to the new gen.

JRPG,3a2agd,Hexatona,4,Tue Jun 16 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"Very early version of the UI?  They might just all be called ""special attack"" or something as a placeholder."
JRPG,3a2agd,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"Call me a negative Nancy, when they released the trailer all that time ago, the whole thing looked slightly fake, almost like they cgi'd a mockup of the gameplay.  I was on the lookout for the same thing here, and the lack of hud interaction game me some pause, what with all the commands just activating out of the blue.  I just suspect something disingenuous in some way, I guess."
JRPG,3a2agd,Hexatona,6,Tue Jun 16 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"I think people seriously underestimate how long it takes for a game to be truly, 100% playable.  http://kotaku.com/the-real-stories-behind-e3-s-glossy-game-demos-1710169104  If the release date was next week I'd be concerned, but this game still has a lot of work left before its ready for launch, so of course under closer inspection it seems disingenuous."

JRPG,3a2agd,xelested,3,Tue Jun 16 18:58:01 2015 UTC,Where's the Disney? Where's the Final Fantasy?  It's nice how the game is developing its own personality but let's not forget how the game started and why it was appealing.
JRPG,3a2agd,VitaminCaim,5,Tue Jun 16 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"It is clearly still very early on. World / level design is actually one of the biggest time investments in game development.

JRPG,3a2agd,ACardAttack,3,Wed Jun 17 00:56:53 2015 UTC,Ps4 looks like a better option to me as it seems to have more interesting exclsuives. Granted It'll probably be 3 or 4 years before I even consider actually buying one. Gotta wait for that price drop and I don't really have a ton of money anyway.
JRPG,3a2agd,mynewaccount5,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be the one I'm leaning towards, though I like some of the stuff on XB1 too."

JRPG,3a22by,animusdx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:04:59 2015 UTC,I'm gonna wait to see if the NX will have backwards compatibility honestly. PS4's JRPG library looks a lot better right now
JRPG,3a22by,7mad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but you'll be waiting until 2016 and beyond to play most of the lineup. I would say Wii U has more to offer now and throughout 2015.  Although Atlus is insisting Persona 5 is coming out on 2015, which is probably worth it on its own."
JRPG,3a22by,Electrium,-1,Wed Jun 17 05:00:54 2015 UTC,... What does Wii U have in 2015?
JRPG,3a22by,kal110386,0,Wed Jun 17 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade Chronicles X is maybe the only JRPG shown at E3 with an actual release date. On the other hand I guess there's Tales of Zestiria, now that I think about it, but that's also on PC so I'm not sure if that counts. And this is all assuming you're only looking at JRPGs, although I'm looking at everything since this is a several hundred dollar purchase.  On Virtual Console there is also Earthbound Beginnings, Earthbound, Golden Sun, Paper Mario, Megaman Battle Network 1-4, Fire Emblem (GBA), Breath of Fire 2, and whatever the heck else they decide to randomly put up there."
JRPG,3a22by,Electrium,-1,Wed Jun 17 06:15:14 2015 UTC,"we are talking about virtual console games as 2015 releases now?  ok fine, there are tons of indies, remastered ports, and PS Now games coming to PS4 this year."

JRPG,3a460u,meikyoushisui,2,Tue Jun 23 05:37:09 2015 UTC,The first one was literally called Shin Megami Tensei: Persona.   It's an SMT game.

It didn't get SMT attached to the name until P3 came out in the west. Atlus US even stated they only added SMT to the title to raise awareness in the west that SMT was a thing since SMT was barely known in the west.  Even the Megami Ibunroku part was dropped by Persona 2 though and has only been used on Devil Survivor, which was also titled a SMT game in the west.  Persona isn't SMT."

JRPG,3a460u,PannyPannePan,-6,Wed Jun 17 15:04:08 2015 UTC,It is basically a big weeb game. Cashing in on Japanese Vocaloid culture.
JRPG,3a460u,enigmatican,8,Wed Jun 17 03:58:07 2015 UTC,Thanks Projared
JRPG,3a460u,PannyPannePan,2,Wed Jun 17 06:06:57 2015 UTC,where are you getting vocaloid from this?
JRPG,3a460u,meikyoushisui,2,Wed Jun 17 05:40:17 2015 UTC,"I think he's reference what appear to be like, pop idols in the game. I didn't get the vocaloid vibe specifically, but there did appear be what looked like pop idols"
JRPG,3a35zu,HyakuShiki0812,7,Tue Jun 16 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"While I'm interested to see what comes of project Setsuna, it's still too early for me to get too excited about it.  I'll reserve my hype for when they release more information.    But high quality JRPGs seem to be making a resurgence this gen with   FF XV  FF Type - 0  FF 7 remake  Star Ocean 5  KH 3  Xenoblade Chronicles X  Persona 5  Tales of Zestiria  Just to name a few.  It's a good time to be a JRPG fan."
JRPG,3a35zu,Nomanorus,2,Tue Jun 16 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of this. What I am excited to see is who the senior developers of the studio are. Obviously their intent with the job ad was to find new young talent to work under key leads--Hiroyuki Ito and Takashi Tokita come to mind.  It's this very ""ethos"" you describe that will allow this studio to outperform their parent developer."
JRPG,3a35zu,H_Floyd,2,Tue Jun 16 22:05:57 2015 UTC,It's great but where the heck were the 3DS games from SE? Even the Vita got World of Final Fantasy.
JRPG,3a35zu,wildthing202,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:41:04 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if they are just going to re-remake them for the PS4 and Vita and not port them via the 3DS.   SE seems to be all in on PS4 and Sony now, so it could happen.  I just need more Dragon Quest. don't care which system."
JRPG,3a35zu,DQ11,0,Mon Jun 22 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"I just don't get the excitement. Kingdom Hearts has never been that good of a series, mostly living of it's crossover schtick while the games are more on the bland side. No Kingdom Hearts game could ever hold a candle to the true classics of the genre. Star Ocean 5 needs to hit it out of the ballpark and then some considering how bad Star Ocean 4 was. I'd rather have them not do another title in that series or at least attempt something new. And whoever cut that particular trailer needs to read some basic Windows Movie Maker tutorials because I've seen stuff made in WMM looking more impressive.   Then we are having FFXV which looks promising, I'll give it that, but the battle system in the demo seemed to lack depth and it's really hard to form a good first impression based on that. (Haven't played 2.0 yet, though) And considering how atrocious the Lightning trilogy was I think being cautious with the next mainline FF game is hardly the prudent stance to take. While I am happy to see Nier get a ""sequel"", especially considering that Platinum Games will be developing it so the gameplay will end up being half decent instead of fetch quest mania, after having seen all of the endings for Nier I felt that that particular story does not really need to be continued. But I will be cautiously optimistic about it.  And then we get a remake that, quite honestly, is not necessary one bit. I'd much rather see them create something new as opposed to trying to hark back to the glory days which sounds like a recipe for disaster. FF7 hasn't aged well, most old FF's haven't, so they have a mountain to climb to turn it into something that will be acceptable in 201X. The quality of the dialogue/localisation alone is so awful that they will probably have to retranslate the whole game. Also top kek at them still going ahead in realising the PC port on PS4.  Project Setsuna sounds interesting but with so little information and some meaningless phrases thrown around -- not the first time for Squenix -- I don't see enough to get excited yet.  The only decent Squenix JRPGs of the past 10 years or so have been on mobile platforms, namely Bravely Default and FF Type-0. What I've seen from their press conference doesn't give me much reason to believe that this will change in any way whatsoever. Thankfully we will be getting Bravely Second eventually, now that's one to get properly excited for, especially for retro fanatics."
JRPG,3a35zu,AFCSentinel,3,Tue Jun 16 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts is literally Disney x Final Fantasy. I don't really see how that's ""bland"" lol. Maybe you shouldn't be so pessimistic."
JRPG,3a35zu,no1babbydaddy,0,Thu Jun 18 22:14:10 2015 UTC,"He didn't say the crossover was bland, he said the games were. I think about that tries to argue with that is kidding themselve . The concept is much better in theory than any of the games ever were in practice"

JRPG,3a35zu,hippityhops,2,Wed Jun 17 07:59:07 2015 UTC,Jrpgs back then seemed to offer so much more than now. I hate the whole moe thing or the overreliance on anime clichées.

JRPG,3a27pw,Choubugioxkei,4,Tue Jun 16 17:31:24 2015 UTC,I really hope that it's better than both of their recent individual releases. Both games had interesting concepts but were underwhelming as a whole.
JRPG,3a27pw,starlizzle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"This a million times.  I have absolutely nothing against trying new ideas. But when you fuck up the whole franchise, I will be angry.  Thousand Year Door was a great step up from the original Paper Mario. It improved upon everything and introduced new elements. The story was full of charm and humor. The gameplay enjoyable.  Every paper mario fan wants the next paper mario to be built on the foundation of thousand year door   Sticker Star was just giant gimmick..."
JRPG,3a27pw,Metatron-X,2,Fri Jun 19 20:39:43 2015 UTC,I liked the concept and gimmick of sticker star. The problem for me was the fact that gathering stickers became pointless and you could just skip fights. Things were even more pointless outside of randomly figuring out which one can be used on a boss. It just wasn't fleshed out enough
JRPG,3a27pw,starlizzle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"I fully agree   I have nothing against new concepts but as you said it was not fleshed out. If the mechanics were embedded in a RPG system it might have had more substance. I also felt the story was weaker than previous entries.  The same with Super Paper Mario. I liked the story and the humor but the gameplay, while I enjoyed the core of it, was lacking ""meat"""

JRPG,3a4rt9,ImpedingMadness,2,Wed Jun 17 08:54:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's jsut my opinion. I don't think IX's art style would translate well to a realistic setting."
JRPG,3a4rt9,fanboy_killer,2,Wed Jun 17 09:24:53 2015 UTC,"Its an engine, an engine doesn't decide art style, or whether its 3d/2D."
JRPG,3a4rt9,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:49:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't decides the art style but I know the limitation as I have a bit experience in game engine. Putting IX in BD engine sounds like HD remaster rather than remake.  BD is also in 3DS which quite possible that the engine only works in 3ds and they don't bother make the engine to pull crazy stuffs.  Rather than BD engine, they should remake it in KH's engine. It's the perfect solution. KH is already fantasy art(not realistic) which in line with IX."
JRPG,3a4rt9,ImpedingMadness,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:13:18 2015 UTC,"Its true that the KH engine might be 3DS only, its quite possible indeed.  I've got maybe 10 years experience with engines myself too, professionally speaking (not sure how long it'd be non-professionally).  To be honest we're also got no idea what the BD engine can do, its possible it can do a hell of a lot but they used it for bravely default and didn't take advantage ofits many features.  The KH engine could work, but the fantasy art side of things is just art, the KH engine wold feature the KH combat system too, which is bad for IX, it'd take a few large changes."
JRPG,3a4rt9,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think you meant BD in the first sentence.  Well, it depends. Remake or remaster? For the remake battle system in KH, they can incorporate turn based (waiting bar) or something like that without have to load another window for battle encounter. Seriously, IMO, I hate seeing old style encounter in fluid 3d environment (but that's probably just me as I mostly run away from battle) and I'm pretty sure FF7 won't use old  battle system if they follow FFXV  Well, we can just talk all day long but won't change a thing. Just need to wait for winter announcement."
JRPG,3a4rt9,ImpedingMadness,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:14:52 2015 UTC,I actually think FFIX would work very well in the style of the bigger World of Final Fantasy models (not the super chibi ones).

JRPG,3a4rt9,burrito_sensei,3,Wed Jun 17 07:01:33 2015 UTC,"You're confusing this with an 'HD remaster'   This is actually going to take quite a bit of effort and they will esentially be releasing a 'new' game, rather than a game like FF10/12 HD which everyone played on an emulator 10 years ago."
JRPG,39zl0r,Agriasoaks,41,Tue Jun 16 01:49:32 2015 UTC,I'm fucking shocked they're making it.  It's really actually happening. And while I have mixed feelings i am erring toward cautious optimism.

JRPG,39zl0r,btbcorno,18,Tue Jun 16 02:07:36 2015 UTC,This is 100% why they are making it. Financially Square hasn't had a huge hit in years and this will sell like crazy.
JRPG,39zl0r,Urethra,16,Tue Jun 16 02:18:18 2015 UTC,Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is doing way better than they expected and is making them boatloads of money.
JRPG,39zl0r,moogmagician,13,Tue Jun 16 06:21:31 2015 UTC,It may even boost interest in the series and RPGs in general... like it did before.
JRPG,39zl0r,lplegacy,2,Tue Jun 16 02:22:00 2015 UTC,They were waiting to release it just before Final Fantasy XV I'm guessing to increase the hype/demand of the Final Fantasy franchise.
JRPG,39zl0r,btbcorno,9,Tue Jun 16 02:51:53 2015 UTC,It is actually interesting to wonder how they would effect each others sales. I have very little interest in XV compared to VII
JRPG,39zl0r,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Tue Jun 16 03:04:04 2015 UTC,"Probably very little considering the FFVII remake according to preliminary info isn't slated for release for another two years.

JRPG,39zl0r,naylord,2,Tue Jun 16 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people, myself included, bought FFXIII because we liked the series and then subsequently felt burned by it; I'm not getting FFXV because of it (at least not without proof via strong reception that it isn't crap like 13)"
JRPG,39zl0r,bitchdantkillmyvibe,2,Tue Jun 16 04:43:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, that's probably a smart thing to do, with any game really. It's rarely smart to buy into hype."

JRPG,39zl0r,Cake__Attack,109,Tue Jun 16 02:33:59 2015 UTC,"If they don't change anything I'm gonna be pretty interested in how people react, because FFVII is a pretty weird game in a lot of ways that people don't quite remember anymore.  Not in an insulting way mind you, I like the game, I just think there's a pretty big difference between what FFVII was and what people remember FFVII as, and I'm curious how that difference will play out in a remake."

I'm pretty sure the game only escaped an ""M"" rating because the localization made much of it incomprehensible.  That's one of many reasons why the new script will be the most interesting change for me. It could completely change my outlook on the game."

JRPG,39zl0r,SilentLettersSuck,9,Tue Jun 16 02:53:43 2015 UTC,Old Cloud was such a boss. Everything post-FF7 made Cloud into such a little shit that I am really afraid of this remake.

JRPG,39zl0r,Cake__Attack,14,Tue Jun 16 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"Tifa and Aeris kinda got their characters swapped at some point down the line. Tifa was always the more demure one, while Aeris was more outgoing, but their character designs intentionally suggest the opposite and so things eventually got muddled and swapped."

I couldn't disagree more, but it's definitely an opinion that's out there.   Of course, it's not like FF's recent attempts at non-turned-based battle systems have received mainstream praise either. It's really just another reason this remake is going to be so interesting - will they change the battle system or leave it the same, and would either satisfy people?"
JRPG,39zl0r,Lezzles,12,Tue Jun 16 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"They need to at least balance it for interest. 99% of that game is just ""attack"" and nothing else. The best party is incredibly clear cut between 4 characters and there's really not a single fight that you'll ever encounter difficulty with unless you're doing emerald and ruby. ATB is fine but it definitely needs some cleaning up."

I feel like they're going to keep the battle system, just make it move faster, and probably add some new shit.   If they went action there would be an enormous outcry. They would also be fucking over the materia system. How do they add hundreds of materia and all the complexity of the arrangements and leveling, all the enemy skills and all that shit in an action system? It's impossible."
JRPG,39zl0r,DaxterAttano,2,Tue Jun 16 02:35:12 2015 UTC,I think it'd be neat to alter it to be more in line with how say child of light does it. Same concept but it goes much faster and stops automatically when someone hits a full bar. It would fulfill the same requirements without being as slow.
JRPG,39zl0r,Kerrigor2,20,Tue Jun 16 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"action-based   Plz no. lol I just want a traditional turn-based game.

JRPG,39zl0r,renatomunhozz,3,Tue Jun 16 09:40:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly I think you are right about the world map. I really don't understand why a lot of modern games do away with it. Bravely Default had it and it was really great. Plus, there is so much secret stuff to find on the world map. I can't really imagine how they would replace it."
JRPG,39zl0r,Duraz0rz,5,Tue Jun 16 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"I understand all the love about classic world maps. I like them too. But let's try to look at it from another perspective: without the need to actually cross every place (like in Xenoblade Chronicles and FFXII) we miss the opportunity to really see everything the game's world has to offer. How would those two games have been if all that wonderful world exploration had been cut from the game in favor of a classic world map with miniature cities?  I think this remake should expand everything the original had to offer, and giving us more of the world to explore is one of the best things it could do. Make the cities bigger, make us really make our way from Point A to Point B in the map. When I think about this, I can't help but think we would miss A LOT in case Square decides to go full classic on this.  ** Sorry about any english mistakes and weird word choices."
JRPG,39zl0r,VladimirDren,2,Tue Jun 16 13:02:54 2015 UTC,"If they're using the same engine from FFXV, what's stopping them from making the world map? We already know FFXV had world map-level exploration. Why can't this remake have it?"
JRPG,39zl0r,njtrafficsignshopper,4,Tue Jun 16 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't want ANY changes, I think that would be the best. Add things maybe, pretty up the graphics, and for the love of all that's holy give us a comprehensible translation. CHANGES though? No thanks."
JRPG,39zl0r,Cake__Attack,2,Tue Jun 16 03:19:57 2015 UTC,Could you be more specific
JRPG,39zl0r,so3arbelnox,36,Tue Jun 16 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure. In my experience people remember FFVII as a very serious, very gritty game, and while there is some truth to that, particularly aesthetically, it overlooks how bizzare, surreal and kinda comedic the game could be at times. Cloud crossdresses as a girl, he bathes with a bunch of muscle men, he rides a dolphin to jump onto an electrical tower. One of your party members is a cat riding some kinda white puppet, who at one point dramatically sacrifices himself, only to come back 10 minutes later because he was remote controlled dummy, you knew that. It's a pretty weird game!  There's also issues of characterization. Cloud is traditionally remembered as basically to ur-angsty-jrpg-lead, when he's anything but. He's basically a goofy kid who pretends to be a badass, to not get too deep into his character arc. Tifa and Aerith have similar fates - I'd wager most people played the game as kids and not since would describe Tifa as outgoing and tomboyish, and Aerith as more demure and ladylike. This is basically the opposite of the truth though, despite being the brawler Tifa is pretty demure, while Aerith is energetic and outgoing despite being the staff girl.  I think that gives a fairly good overview, although it's obviously not everything."
JRPG,39zl0r,BrainDeadUnit,4,Tue Jun 16 05:15:22 2015 UTC,I feel like that’s true of almost any JRPG though. Xenogears despite having a very serious story had Chu Chu (wtf!?) and Megami games have some goofy monsters. Same can be said for a lot of Anime. I don't think FF7 is unique in that regard.
JRPG,39zl0r,CorruptedToaster,4,Tue Jun 16 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, generally the grittier the atmosphere the more comedic relief you'll find.  Kind of needed as it lets character development build beyond ""these are just the good guys getting the shit beat out of them every day."""
JRPG,39zl0r,kevinsucks,3,Tue Jun 16 11:59:09 2015 UTC,I think you just helped me realize why FF13 is such a hard sell to so many people(myself included).
JRPG,39zl0r,Zuckerriegel,2,Tue Jun 16 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was implying FF7 was unique in that regard, just that people see it differently than how it was these days. And I think it's partly due to Square's own efforts in expanding the FF7 universe with later media (Dirge of Cerberus, Crisis Core, Advent Children) where-in the tone was significantly darker, and a lot of the humor and self-awareness present in the original game goes missing."
JRPG,39zl0r,konaaa,2,Tue Jun 16 13:44:33 2015 UTC,I just want the Don Corneo stuff to stay. I need a fully HD cross-dressing Cloud.
JRPG,39zl0r,metagloria,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:08:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I've always felt that the midgar part of the game is kind of a forerunner to a lot of modern videogame trappings. It's really well paced, aggressively linear, and has a few minor decisions that you can make to impact little bits of plot points. The rest of the game feels a bit more like an snes jrpg which I could see turning some people off. I guess the hope is that the first section hooks them into the game and compels them to see it through. I'm really hoping that they don't change anything, because I think Final Fantasy 7 is amazingly well put together and it's a game that just begs for better technology than the ps1. I AM a bit worried the Nomura is going to put his directorial spin on it which personally ruined the FF7 sequel/prequel franchise for me."

JRPG,39zl0r,Ryuujinx,13,Tue Jun 16 03:31:58 2015 UTC,"I actually really really liked XIII-2 and Lightning Returns.  Lightning Returns was a weird fucking game, though. 13-2 had some great stuff in it. Probably my favorite RPG in the last console generation."
JRPG,39zl0r,lowkeyoh,5,Tue Jun 16 04:04:04 2015 UTC,I couldn't stand 13-3. I loved 13 and 13-2 though.

JRPG,39zl0r,Al_Bhed,2,Tue Jun 16 08:02:47 2015 UTC,It was like Final Fantasy: Majora's Mask.  It was interesting in the sense that it was more about the world and the people in it than it was about the main cast.
JRPG,39zl0r,fanboy_killer,2,Tue Jun 16 14:04:19 2015 UTC,^ This.  Adding that I liked the battle system of XIII-3 (the concept) but when I actually played it was very complex and not rewarding or I didn't adapt.

JRPG,39zl0r,Rhawk187,14,Tue Jun 16 04:22:54 2015 UTC,If this is the reason why Tetsuya Nomura is no longer working on FFXV then I don't have any problems with that!  I wonder how they're going to update the battle system among other things?  I don't know if I can handle this Sony conference anymore.  Every game that I have wanted and has been non-existent for the past 10 years are being announced all at once.  I can only handle so much legitimate hyping.
JRPG,39zl0r,Sprinterstar7,9,Tue Jun 16 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm most curious about.  Stick with a retro ATB, or try to modernize it and risk messing it up."
JRPG,39zl0r,punkbrad7,8,Tue Jun 16 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"It should be interesting to see how they handle it.  Especially when Lost Odyssey, which came out in 2007/8, got a lot of flack for its archaic and outdated battle system."
JRPG,39zl0r,bitchdantkillmyvibe,13,Tue Jun 16 02:23:41 2015 UTC,Lost Odyssey is one of the best 360 rpgs tho. :/
JRPG,39zl0r,Keriaku,3,Tue Jun 16 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but it definitely proved a lot of the concerns surrounding the relevancy of old school JRPG mechanics in modern gaming. I'm playing it for the first time now and I love it, I love it for how true a JRPG it is, but it sold poorly and many of the reviews criticized it for it's outdated mechanics, when really it just stays honest to what the genre has always been about. It's sad, but the general population just doesn't care for true, turn based JRPG's that much anymore."
JRPG,39zl0r,bitchdantkillmyvibe,5,Tue Jun 16 03:34:31 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of the problem with Lost Odyssey was that it was a /slow/ turn based battle system though, not necessarily that it was turn based alone."
JRPG,39zl0r,punkbrad7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:50:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a fair point too, probably my only real issue - battles just take that little bit too long."
JRPG,39zl0r,mdawgig,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"The same reason I wish that Blue Dragon had done better. It did well enough to get a port and a sequel, but still nowhere near the numbers that old school RPGs did back in the day."
JRPG,39zl0r,Rhawk187,4,Tue Jun 16 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"I think most people hated how long and slow the battles were.  They took like a minute to load into, a minute to load out of, and every animation took way too long.  There was a good game there, it just was painful to play at times."
JRPG,39zl0r,cockshittingmanatee,4,Tue Jun 16 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"I think their best bet might be to try to innovate something that lets people set which way they want to play it, so that old people can ATB if they want to.  Might make it harder to balance some of the battles, but at least it will keep people from being able to complain about it too much."
JRPG,39zl0r,adremeaux,11,Tue Jun 16 02:29:48 2015 UTC,I got my torch and pitchforks ready for the inevitable announcement that it isn't turn based
JRPG,39zl0r,AnghellicKarma,2,Tue Jun 16 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"They said ""more info in Winter"", so we aren't going to know for a long time. Best chance is TGS in September, but that's not really winter yet, so who knows."

JRPG,39zl0r,rockboy8,23,Tue Jun 16 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I don't get too much hate for this. Believe me, I'm as psyched as everyone else but I'm also kind of worried. (Spoilers in the post).the game came out 18 years ago  Nomura didn't do the greatest job of portraying Cloud in FF7:AC compared to his FF7 self. Sure the movie was really flashy and had great combat scenes but Cloud's personality was just a lot 'edgier' than his FF7 counterpart. Yes, he matured and I understand that people change but...not that much. Not to the point that I feel uncomfortable with the change.  I'm worried that Nomura will direct the game in a way that it'll be too over the top with him 'absorbing' Zack's persona and be super obvious, or that it'll be Edgy Cloud™ we knew from AC.  My opinion of Nomura isn't the greatest either after I started learning about how he directs games, with this article being an example:  “Nomura has always been working on Kingdom Hearts III full-time, so nothing’s really changed there,” he says. “Nomura is really the visionary, so he doesn’t work on the nitty gritty details. That’s something we do in Osaka; alongside development, we do the technology. That hasn’t really changed. We get Nomura’s input but it’s not a day-to-day thing, he just has these big ideas sometimes he tells us about...""  This says to me that he doesn't really know how to properly direct a game and is more or less an ""ideas guy"" when it comes to things that isn't character art.  I want to be wrong /r/JRPG, I really do. I'm so cautiously optimistic that it hurts but there are a lot of red flags as well. Hold me ;_;.  As long as they keep the story as close to the source material as possible then I think we're fine. I don't really mind changing the gameplay around too much since they finally have some limitations lifted. What's your opinion.   For the love of God please tell me I'm being a little bitch and make me excited for this"
JRPG,39zl0r,mysticrudnin,10,Tue Jun 16 03:42:27 2015 UTC,Fuck...  Final Fantasy VII is an adult now.  God damn.
JRPG,39zl0r,TheOtherShoveAChef,9,Tue Jun 16 06:24:06 2015 UTC,"They'll probably change the combat, and that kind of upsets me. I get it, it's old and people don't like it these days, but man I like turn based combat. I don't need every game I play to be about some twitchy action bullshit. The turn based systems suit a lot of RPGs very well because they're more cinematic ""take it in"" kind of experiences as opposed to something like an FPS."
JRPG,39zl0r,Everythingisachoice,6,Tue Jun 16 07:57:45 2015 UTC,"The best case scenario would be offering a choice at the start between a revamped combat system, or the legacy combat system. This way square will appeal to newer players and also not agitate the older crowd. Though this would probably take a lot of additional work to implement."
JRPG,39zl0r,H_Floyd,4,Tue Jun 16 09:41:55 2015 UTC,the best case scenario is they completely redo the combat but it's still turn based :)
JRPG,39zl0r,darthreuental,5,Tue Jun 16 13:20:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this. FFX has turn-based combat and they left that alone when they remastered it. I agree with you though, I would much prefer it if they keep the combat the way it is."
JRPG,39zl0r,Flamingozilla,2,Tue Jun 16 13:41:49 2015 UTC,"I love the older combat systems. I just can't get into the action oriented combat systems for an RPG or JRPG.    I also think that when you control your whole party as a group, it's a story about all of them and what they're going through. When you only control 1 character and the rest are AI controlled, it becomes a story about that one character and their sidekicks.    You NEED to be able to control your whole party in a FF game. At least that's my opinion."
JRPG,39zl0r,MayonnaiseOreo,5,Tue Jun 16 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"You have named my precise concerns. The very existence of all post-FF7 lore means the remake can't possibly remain true to its original scenario. It also won't retain the same--or probably even similar--battle system. Personalities will change to reflect all retconning. It wouldn't surprise me at all if Zack Cloud were the only playable character.  There are better analogies, but I can't help but thinking about the ""remastered"" original Star Wars trilogy. Just think what they would be like if Lucas remade them instead.  The only good thing that will come of this is that the soundtrack won't sound like a Roland synthesizer from the 90s. Just don't expect Uematsu to arrange it--he doesn't arrange his music anymore, and hasn't for years."
JRPG,39zl0r,TwistedxRainbow,3,Tue Jun 16 12:43:08 2015 UTC,My biggest concern is that the remake will be half-assed and lazy. Look at the Kingdom Hearts HD remakes. You said it yourself -- FFVII is now an old game. It needs more than just some tweaks the graphics.
JRPG,39zl0r,fly2me,9,Tue Jun 16 07:06:23 2015 UTC,"The KH/FFX remakes were basically retextures, FFVII needs to be built from the ground up as most of it its made up of low resolution pre rendered images and low poly count models. The engine will also have to be built from the ground up, as it used a bunch of tricks reliant on the PSX's architecture."
JRPG,39zl0r,traviu,4,Tue Jun 16 09:23:07 2015 UTC,"Those weren't remakes at all. Don't confuse a remake with a remaster. FFVII is going to be an entirely ""new"" game."
JRPG,39zl0r,TheOtherShoveAChef,6,Tue Jun 16 14:43:00 2015 UTC,I'm crossing my fingers that this means FFIX will get a remake in the future too.
JRPG,39zl0r,dieth,3,Tue Jun 16 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"Man, FF9 was really underrated. It would be a welcome addition to the remake family, but least likely since it didn't gross too well overall.   Now something that would seriously make my dick grow is a FF6 remake. Dear God. Please, just, please."
JRPG,39zl0r,waspocracy,2,Tue Jun 16 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"Oh man FF IX is my favourite from all time, I'm not sure how I would feel about a remake...

JRPG,39zl0r,desterion,4,Tue Jun 16 11:44:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder how faithful of a remake this is going to be. Like, will they keep the older sides to the game like the fixed camera and hand-drawn backgrounds but just redraw them? Will there be voice acting?   Also, I'm kind of expecting Squeenix to do what they did with KH3 and give us a trailer and then make us wait years for any more information on the game."

JRPG,39zl0r,ACardAttack,3,Tue Jun 16 03:39:10 2015 UTC,"It's going to be very interesting to see how they approach this. The modern, realistic style doesn't really fit FF7 in my opinion, the Advent Children character models leave me utterly cold. I'd also be sad to see the pre-rendered backgrounds and cinematic angles go if they do it in full 3D - nothing helps a JRPG town or world feel smaller than spinning the camera around and seeing exactly how the developers have boxed you in to keep you on the right track. The spectre of voice acting and modern SE 'mature' writing looms large over this remake.  On the bright side, with Nomura directing they've got one of the few people left at SE who might be able to do it justice. On the downside, with Nomura directing we'll probably see the next trailer at E3 2018."
JRPG,39zl0r,Darkerson,2,Tue Jun 16 08:04:53 2015 UTC,"Really the catch with previous generation gaming is that it leaves a lot to each player's own imagination. With Advent Children, you saw what the creators truly intended. That was their interpretation, and why they hesitated so long with a flat out remake. I think it's just something you need to accept. For me, it's not my most ideal, but still it is an exceptional world to be immersed in."

JRPG,39zl0r,blackwaltz9,3,Tue Jun 16 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"I'd be absolutely happy with a remake similar to how they did FF4 for the PSP.. They don't need to do a full blown HD 3D remake (to bring it in line with the FF's from the PS era)   The mobile remake of VI is just bad. :\ It's closer to the PSP FF4 than anything else, but it's still just so bad.."

JRPG,39zl0r,mysticrudnin,8,Tue Jun 16 04:34:46 2015 UTC,IX still looks pretty good. VII was in desperate need of a graphical enhancement.
JRPG,39zl0r,DonnieNJ,5,Tue Jun 16 05:31:50 2015 UTC,"I get the excitement, but I'm taking this as a sign that, creatively speaking, Square Enix has hit rock bottom. They could have released a genuinely interesting new game, but instead we're getting the mother of all cash grabs.  I hope it's a legitimately good game for people who liked the original, but I have no intention of buying this and honestly, this kills any remaining hope I had that SE would release another interesting FF game any time in the next few years."

That's one of the main reasons I've absolutely no confidence in SE these days: most of what they put out is remakes and play on nostalgia, while having real difficulty in actually coming out with new, good games."
JRPG,39zl0r,paulwall217,3,Tue Jun 16 09:33:39 2015 UTC,"You mean like the dozen other genuinely interesting new games they announced in today's E3 segment, including Word of Final Fantasy.

JRPG,39zl0r,rosconotorigina,2,Tue Jun 16 02:23:06 2015 UTC,4-6 were also remade for the GBA to be fair.

JRPG,39zl0r,brutalknuckles,2,Tue Jun 16 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"I just started replaying the Steam version of FFVII for the first time in a few years and I found myself liking it even more than I remembered liking it as a kid, so I'm looking forward to this. If nothing else, I'm sure it will be absolutely gorgeous to look at.  My one maybe kind of weird hope that probably won't happen: I wish there was some kind of reward for sticking with the same materia/punishment for switching materia too much. Like if you keep the same materia equipped for x number of battles, you should get a bonus to its growth rate, and if you remove it, you should have an AP penalty for that materia.  My one gripe with the game is that the characters don't feel unique in battle. If I have to bring a character I don't normally use, I can swap out bracelets and materia and it's basically the same character with a different appearance and limit break. I like that you can build any character any way you want, but I also think it'd be cool to be rewarded for making each character fulfill a unique role."
JRPG,39zl0r,FirionII,3,Tue Jun 16 03:24:09 2015 UTC,"Eh they did that in the remake of FF3/5, and it was very poorly received. Punishment for changing job classes was bad, and it served almost no purpose."
JRPG,39zl0r,chronikfunk,2,Tue Jun 16 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for this, because it means that FF6 is certainly still a possibility for the remake table."
JRPG,39zl0r,Akira619,2,Tue Jun 16 03:29:12 2015 UTC,I really hope they change a lot and just keep the same basic story. A lot of the original just wouldn't fit in as a AAA modern game.
JRPG,39zl0r,Lyriq,2,Tue Jun 16 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"People are expecting this to take a long time. I don't think it will, we can safely say the game will use an already established engine (Luminous), Character development, story, environments, etc are already done for the game. Whats left is simply putting everything into the engine. I would be willing to bet the more risque scenes, IE cross dresser Cloud and some of the more odd scenes will be changed in some way but the core of the game will remain intact. I don't see them changing the battle system or core game mechanics in any way. The story will most likely play out the same (hopefully with more content overall). Also, based on the talent they have on the game from the trailer its safe to say the core team that made FF7 is mostly intact for this remake. I would feel comfortable saying we could see a Summer or Holiday release for 2017."

JRPG,39zl0r,H_Floyd,2,Tue Jun 16 08:17:30 2015 UTC,"If they're going for a full remake with possible additions, I would be okay with them allowing you to have more than just 3 characters in your party. I don't think it would change anything story wise but I always struggled with who I'd have in my party (and I feel like I'm the only person who never put Aeris in the line up -- which made her death scene really not that big of a deal)."

JRPG,39zl0r,H_Floyd,2,Tue Jun 16 13:52:16 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with change, and I expect it. But I don't want them to get rid of the humor that was there. A lot of people don't remember scenes like the hot tub at the gym haha.  The only thing that worries me is that they won't keep Yuffie and Vincent as optional characters."

JRPG,39zl0r,Takokun,2,Tue Jun 16 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"I am completely stunned. I broke down in tears when they showed the teaser. I grew up on FF VII on the PlayStation. I've wanted, scratch that, I've CRAVED this. A full HD remake, will be amazing. If I have to mug a Wal Mart electronics clerk to get a PS4 for it, I will j/k but seriously, I MUST get this. But I also admit, I'm going to need a full bottle of anti-depressants and bottle of Xanax to not have a psychotic break when I see Aris cleaved in half in HD, but I must still see it. I do wonder though, since it will be PS4, and as fast as technology is jumping forward, I wonder. Will they make it VR compatible since it has a 2016/2017 release date?"
JRPG,39zl0r,elPedroGrande,4,Tue Jun 16 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this is terrible news.  We'll never get FFXVI."

JRPG,39zl0r,G0T0,5,Tue Jun 16 02:05:35 2015 UTC,"What I wonder about is the length of development. This, FFXV, and KH3 are all a long way off. A sixteenth entry isn't feasibly on the horizon for at least another 5 years."
JRPG,39zl0r,Mr_Shine,4,Tue Jun 16 02:22:07 2015 UTC,Throughout the trailer my girlfriend kept denying it but I kept pointing out why it was FF7. Once Barrett's gun arm came onto screen she couldn't deny it anymore.

I've played Bravely Default, Kingdom Hearts, and am currently making my way through FF Tactics; but I have never played a mainline game. I would like to get myself familiar with the series in time for the remake to come out. I'm estimating that I have a minimum of 10 months to get through it. However I do not know where to start. Many of the games have different versions and I'm not keen on playing the entire series. I will of course play the original ff VII before the remake comes out but I also have 6 and 9.  What others do you think I should play to really prepare myself? And I don't mean just the best, but what will make me really be able to say I know the series."

Personally I love 5 and 10-2 but think 6 and 10 are kind of meh. But they're more important for understanding the series and the fandom."

The soundtracks on GBA suck, honestly, and the DS port is just missing something, imho.  Then 6, 7, back to 5.  Then 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 12.

Furthermore, I hear that the story goes into weird directions/gets retconned in later entries like Crisis Core, so how will those factor into the game, if at all.  Think angsty Cloud versus the original.  However, if they can pull it off, that would be really nice."

Anyone got any more info other than it's coming and that you can ride the monsters?"
JRPG,3a17wz,ffxivthrowaway03,4,Tue Jun 16 12:57:41 2015 UTC,I think it looks cool.  It gives me a Kingdom Hearts vibe if you removed all the bullshit Disney stuff from it.
JRPG,3a17wz,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"I was getting more ""A Link Between Worlds: Final Fantasy edition"" than Kingdom Hearts, but that's also because saying Kingdom Hearts has to include Birth by Sleep and KH2, neither of which I would compare to this game."
JRPG,3a17wz,FFF12321,2,Tue Jun 16 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"The non-chibi character designs definitely have a KH feel to them, but I see what you mean.  It just seems like a very light hearted game set in the meta Final Fantasy universe, with plenty of cameos.  I wouldn't be surprised if we find out that the area design boils down to going between different Final Fantasy ""worlds"" representing each game in the series similarly to how KH had you visiting different Disney movies."
JRPG,3a17wz,Magus80,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:08:57 2015 UTC,For me the boy looks a lot like Roxas and the overall aesthetics are very KH.  Wonder if Tetsuya did the character designs?

JRPG,3a17wz,Shenji06,2,Tue Jun 16 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that will be some sort of ""form shift"" to change how you do things in battle. They mentioned riding monsters or having them ride you, so I suppose that it might be a way to change what dual techs you have available."

Some guy at the Sony stage says there is no money for the game (meaning: because Sony didn't want to put as well). They brag how many copies of consoles they sold but when the opportunity appears to give a few million to create ex then they say ""NO"" because some suckers will fund them? Audience should hiss at this point. Although there is no chance at this point but I sincerely hope this collection will fail because it only creates new sick trends."
JRPG,3a0a3i,Cejdej,3,Tue Jun 16 07:25:29 2015 UTC,Pretty certain that Sony partially funded it.
JRPG,3a0a3i,diction203,3,Tue Jun 16 11:58:40 2015 UTC,"I'm really not a fan of Kickstarter funding either, but $2 million alone isn't enough to make a game like Shenmue 3. Game development for larger titles like that can easily run into the double digits of millions.   I'm sure Sony is also taking on a large amount of the marketing costs (with Sony console exclusivity and all), which can exceed the cost of game development itself."
JRPG,3a0a3i,Tothoro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"If you think $2 million is a substantial amount to make a game like Shenmue 3, you're sorely oblivious to the actual costs that goes into developing games.

JRPG,39w6xu,VitaminCaim,6,Mon Jun 15 17:48:16 2015 UTC,Well Sony just won E3.
JRPG,39w6xu,StarFireLiz,9,Tue Jun 16 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what to make of this. Siliconera are generally a very reliable news source, but the cry wolf effect is so deeply ingrained in an FFVII remake that it's hard to take at face value.   That being said, I could easily imagine Square Enix's press conference tomorrow ending with a sort of 'haha! I bet you didn't see that one coming!' moment. It would also make them flying put Hashimoto to PSX for that non-announcment, like they pulled their big thing at the last minute. They could also end by saying 'wait for FFVII HD in 2017, or play the original on PS4 TODAY!'  It has a whiff of plausibility about it, especially considering the 20th anniversary bit of it."
JRPG,39w6xu,HyakuShiki0812,5,Mon Jun 15 08:39:26 2015 UTC,"A couple wars back Square Enix actually said they don't ever want to do a true remake because it'd be too polarizing. Too many people wouldn't like the changes they said. Its fairly true. Gamers are the hardest people to satisfy and there would be so many people nit picking the shit out of the game, especially if anything wasn't exactly right.   The logic used was that it's fine the way it is.   I could see them redacting on that statement anyhow because the basic strategy for this generation of games is just to remake everything that was remotely popular a while back and put it on ps4."
JRPG,39w6xu,jolsiphur,5,Mon Jun 15 11:55:26 2015 UTC,"It's late in the game now, but all they had to do prior to PS4 coming out was take the Dirge of Cerberus/Crisis Core models, touch up the poly counts, reskin some characters back to their old outfits, and use the environment textures from Crisis Core to cobble together a Frankenstein monster of an HD port to Vita and PS3. Don't even bother to voice it since everyone hates the voices anyway.  People are going to expect more now. That level of effort won't cut it. Especially after this. Whether or not it happens at this point in time, people will want it for PS4 now."
JRPG,39w6xu,Daverost,2,Mon Jun 15 13:37:39 2015 UTC,People are always going to expect more. FF7 is just one of those games. People will expect more than an HD port will likely deliver.
JRPG,39w6xu,jolsiphur,6,Mon Jun 15 13:47:42 2015 UTC,My honest opinion is that people just want to play the game without everyone looking like a blocky Popeye. A graphics upgrade and taking the music beyond midi quality would probably be enough.  But I've been wrong before.
JRPG,39w6xu,Daverost,4,Mon Jun 15 14:02:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind that. But in my humble opinion I think that FF7 is way too overrated anyways. I think for the fans it'd be great to get an HD remake. But I do get where Square would be coming from if they never wanted to. People nit pick the shit out of that stuff. Especially for FF7 where they'd have to actually remake the game from the ground up.
JRPG,39w6xu,jolsiphur,4,Mon Jun 15 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who hasn't played FF7, and the newer generations that haven't played it, it'd be nice. I hear nothing but amazing things about it and while my expectations are high, it's a game. If they were to remake FF VIII, which I absolutely love, its not going to ruin my childhood memories of the PSX version because of an attempt to remake it. I'd be happy that people who's first console was a PS3-4 would get to play it and enjoy the game."
JRPG,39w6xu,Michael174,2,Mon Jun 15 14:50:36 2015 UTC,yeah but trust me. playing it in its original version is not going to be much worse. That game is still great.

JRPG,39w6xu,ndhl83,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"I found the story telling wasn't well paced and the characters very unlikable. It could be because I played it after 6, which I found to be a better title. I don't think any of them need a remake to hold up in today's market. Funny enough a remake of FF7 I'd like to see would like to see would be one that would use the original non-3D art style from extremely early builds. But that's only because I've seen the stills from that art style and thought the models were gorgeous and had a hand painted quality to them."
JRPG,39w6xu,jolsiphur,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"Personal opinion on the story/characters aside, I have to say I thought the actual storytelling/pacing in the game was well done except for the Cloud ""Who am I?"" stuff...it always struck me as ham fisted, and they could clear it up a lot, easily. Aside from that, though, I always thought the story, theme, and world would benefit from a massive graphical overhaul for a re-telling. The combat is standard ATB and could stand some spice or a twist, but the materia system was a good one.  Now, that said, I also enjoy FFVI more, especially in the character department, and it is another FF I feel deserves a remake, though I would settle for one in the vein of FFIV DS :)"
JRPG,39w6xu,ndhl83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"That's all I'm asking for, myself, as a boy whose first pre-order was FF7 (with a T-shirt!) and who stayed home from school on release to play it through the weekend."
JRPG,39w6xu,ndhl83,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what will happen. A remaster to 1080p scaling and better models I can see, but a full 3D remake will change the fundamental gameplay. Voice acting will change scenes dramatically to alter the impact of the originals.   People had a shitfit about the PC version's music change"

JRPG,39w6xu,jolsiphur,5,Tue Jun 16 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"I saw it and thought ""wait what"" because Siliconera usually don't post stuff like this with no source.  I'm in the camp of hoping it's not true, because it's frankly stupid. Stop beating that dead horse and focus on making the new games actually GOOD."
JRPG,39w6xu,DisplacedLondoner,4,Mon Jun 15 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"I kind of have mixed feelings myself about the idea of a remake, in all honesty. While theoretically playing FFVII with the graphics we're seeing in FFXV would be great, I just don't know how much they'd change it up and I could see it splitting the fanbase down the middle between the people wanting a pure graphical upgrade and the people wanting a modernized game. In the case of the prior, which honestly I'd prefer, it'd probably fail commercially for being too archaic, and review scores would probably slam it too. In the more likely case of the latter, I'd have to question what changes they'd make - would the stuff like the Honeybee Inn stay in, would Yuffie and Vincent be shoehorned into the plot and cease to be optional, would they ram Genesis references down our throats, &c. And how much would gameplay change? Would they dare to release a PS4 game with a PS1 style world map and ATB combat? The balance between faithfulness and modernity might be too difficult to find and it's entirely possible they'd make a prettier but inferior game to the original."
JRPG,39w6xu,HyakuShiki0812,2,Mon Jun 15 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"Look at what they did with FFX/FFX-2.  The precedent for them doing a marvelous job on an HD remaster is already there.  Except with FFVII we already got the international version with additional content (Ruby/Emerald Weapon, etc).  And it sold like hotcakes despite having an ""archaic"" turn based battle system."
JRPG,39w6xu,ffxivthrowaway03,5,Mon Jun 15 11:53:36 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between a remake and a remaster though. A remaster is what I'd prefer, because that's just a pure graphical upgrade, but from a PS1 game with prerendered backgrounds, it would be a difficult job, far more than with FFX, which already had an almost fully 3D World and environments."
JRPG,39w6xu,HyakuShiki0812,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:58:49 2015 UTC,"Of course you're right, I'm not putting any faith in a two sentence no-source siliconera posting to discern whether or not it's a remaster or a remake.  But I think if they do FFVII they'd have to do a ""remake"" because most of what they're working with is static 2d assets that weren't originally created with 1080p resolution in mind.  It's a much different process compared to FFX, as similar to film a lot of those assets (environments, weapons, etc) were originally created with higher resolutions in mind and then scaled back to fit the hardware.    For FFVII they'd have to recreate not only the character models, but most of the game from the ground up.  FFX HD is just a testament to how closely they intended to stick to the source material.  I don't think they would remake FFVII and drastically change the game."
JRPG,39w6xu,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yea it would be a complete remake. Almost nothing from the original is usable, except as concept art. They are really going to have to embellish to fill in the world once they bring it to a 3D engine. That could be cool, if done right.  ....if this is really happening. Which I hope it does. The original didn't age well, and I'd love to re-live it and share it with my kids."
JRPG,39w6xu,dgrimm121,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:52:00 2015 UTC,"Almost impossible since they don't have the original backgrounds anymore, most of FFVII's content was wiped before they started FF8."
JRPG,39w6xu,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Mon Jun 15 14:13:53 2015 UTC,"FFXHD is a terrible example, its using slightly upscaled textures, all its visuals outside of the characters are the same, the font changed, but thats it, animations, everything except main character faces and textures (the hands were also remoddelled).  The rest of the game looked EXACTLY the same as on PS2, with a lot of the NPCS contrasting horribly against the main casts new textures."
JRPG,39w6xu,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"I'm really confused by what features a ""modern"" JRPG has that FFVII didn't have? Enlighten us?

JRPG,39w6xu,ndhl83,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"World map (a rarity), random encounters, fixed camera viewpoint with pre-rendered backgrounds, lack of modern trappings like voice acting, user-controllable camera, &c. I don't think a lot of that would fly in a game with AAA pretensions."
JRPG,39w6xu,HyakuShiki0812,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the newer/younger audience really requires all of those QOL type, uhh, features.

JRPG,39w6xu,ndhl83,2,Mon Jun 15 19:31:34 2015 UTC,"The new games are good, whether you personally enjoy them or not.

JRPG,39w6xu,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:51:11 2015 UTC,"Stop beating that dead horse and focus on making the new games actually GOOD.   I don't think they have the ability to do that anymore, and I don't think more ""focus"" will fix it. If the only games they're going to make that appeal to me anymore are remakes, then at least I can hope for some good remakes. We've seen relatively modern remakes of I-IV, Tactics, and X, but they haven't touched VII through IX yet. I would also like to see them attempt a 3D remake of V in the style of III, although they're probably afraid of that for the same reason that they're afraid of remaking VII. Finally, with X and X-2 HD out, we should be due for XII HD sometime soon, and they could really make good on that by finally releasing an English version of XII IZJS :)"

JRPG,39w6xu,AKABoondock,8,Mon Jun 15 15:23:42 2015 UTC,"A game that is already 100% written and designed is way faster to develop. A large chunk of game development comes in figuring out all your systems, worlds, stories. Then comes the tweaking and balancing, plus the major or minor changes that delete a bunch of existing work in favor of something new.   With a game like this, all you need is an engine (which they have from FF15), some decent programmers, and a ton of artists knocking out assets. The process moves way quicker and is also a lot easier to estimate."

JRPG,39vvkt,yuna733,3,Mon Jun 15 05:43:09 2015 UTC,"Oath in Felghana and Ys: Origin are good entries to the series. It's important to note that Ys I & II have very different mechanics from the other three games. I would play Ys I & II later even though it could be considered a ""starting point"" simply because the gameplay is radically different. I find Ys VI a little underwhelming, but Ys Origin and Oath in Felghana are two of my most favorite action JRPGs of all time. So that's my two cents! Also, most of these games are pretty standalone, although Ys: Origin and Ys I & II Chronicles are linked together in terms of plot. Origin is supposed to be the prequel to I & II."
JRPG,39vvkt,exilarch,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:48:47 2015 UTC,So I guess I'll be choosing between Oath and Origin. Which do you think would be better for someone new to this series? Or are both about the same?
JRPG,39vvkt,TildenJack,2,Mon Jun 15 06:01:47 2015 UTC,"While it's true that Origin has more replay value, it also sends you through the same general dungeon every single time. Can be quite exhausting unless you make a pause in-between every playthrough. Oath has a more varied setting in that regard, which is why I found it more enjoyable."
JRPG,39vvkt,Cake__Attack,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"Both games are mechanically very similar, but I'd say Origins is a bit more novice friendly. It's also got a little more bang for your buck - the main game is about as long as Oath, but in Origins you can do it with three different characters with pretty different play-styles. The third character (who you unlock after beating the game once), even gets some different bosses.  Start with Yunica by the way. Hugo's playstyle really isn't typical of how Ys normally plays and would give the wrong impression."
JRPG,39vvkt,exilarch,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:09:01 2015 UTC,I agree. Origin is more forgiving than Oath. And it has more replay value. You might get bored of Hugo though. I know I did.

However, make sure to have at least 2 hours as you can't save between sessions and the demo has a lot of content (you can leave the game running in the background and enter rest mode if you don't plan to play anything else, but once closed all your progress is gone)."

Also sometimes if you don't have any more valid plays to use, this acts as a simple pass instead of initiating an attack that the enemy will just reflect, absorb, or do nothing."
JRPG,39t8w5,seynical,8,Sun Jun 14 15:51:46 2015 UTC,The SMT series and persona both use defend as a viable option. There are many times in a boss fight in multiple cases in a single game where I needed to defend from a charged attack or the boss was immune to all moves my character had.
JRPG,39t8w5,Yotsubato,5,Sun Jun 14 15:55:39 2015 UTC,I don't grind in games lately thus putting my healers at a one-hit KO when a boss uses its trump. Thus when telltale signs point to a boss unleashing a deadly move; I drop all I'm doing for the healer and defend to survive the attack.

JRPG,39t8w5,Altzan,2,Sun Jun 14 20:57:00 2015 UTC,"Hi I'm developing a classic style JRPG. The reason I'm including defend is in case the player has no other choices because for example they have a status ailment that doesn't allow them to take action or, more importantly, they are a Mage and out of MP and their physical attack is useless. It's better for a Mage to be able to defend than just stand there useless."

However, if it has other functions in addition to defense (mentioned by others already), it becomes far more useful and even common.  I like how in Legend of Dragoon the defend option also heals you. That's a good added function."

JRPG,39t8w5,Callox,7,Sun Jun 14 16:52:55 2015 UTC,"I've never encountered a jrpg where it was totally useless. If you're switching up your main party, or a character comes back into the party after being gone for a while, ""defend"" usually halves damage, giving them the ability to survive and gain xp."
JRPG,39t8w5,kyune,9,Sun Jun 14 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"The issue here is the difficulty of JRPGs, not the function itself. Some of the more difficult ones, such as Persona, almost require occasional defending, even during random encounters."
JRPG,39t8w5,96363,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:06:03 2015 UTC,"Example from the last day or so--Contrarian King on Hard in Persona 4 Golden.  I had a lucky fight where he only used rampage once, but even grinded to level 25/26 or so with access to diamond shields and a mildly levelled slime I still only barely survived and won the fight.    Without items to use Yukiko is practically useless in that fight so when I didn't have a play with her I'd defend on the offchance that rampage went off.  That way she'd survive and could start the media heal train on the next turn."
JRPG,39t8w5,ninetynyne,6,Sun Jun 14 16:25:22 2015 UTC,in legend of the dragoon defending also heals you by a decent amount and almost all the bosses have a two turn charge attack that you want to defend for. it's also useful for healing up without using items in the random encounters. in final fantasy 10 if your trying to collect monsters then you would want to deal the finishing blow with the person that has a weapon with capture on in and it would be a shame if that character didn't get the last hit because someone else couldn't just not do anything and ended up killing them with a basic attack. in the persona series the status effect curse makes it so that when you do damage you take a percentage of that damage back so not wanting to kill that unit you'd want to defend until you can get rid of it. three fine examples of why defend exists
JRPG,39t8w5,AceAttorneyt,3,Sun Jun 14 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"Depending on the game,  it may be strategic.  I remember in Breath of Fire 4, you used defend to learn new skills while there have been a few games where you recover MP.    Overall defend is not used too much but having it available doesn't hurt."
JRPG,39t8w5,vote4petro,3,Tue Jun 16 01:47:39 2015 UTC,"It's an infinitely useful feature in Bravely Default and Persona, as others have mentioned. In other games it's decent for healers on turns where they don't need to heal or buff."
JRPG,39t8w5,HeisenburgerDeluxe,3,Sun Jun 14 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"Depends on the game. Even in Earthbound and Mother 3, defending after taking a hit slows the rate at which your counter ticks down which is really helpful in the last battle of Mother 3."
JRPG,39t8w5,countblah2,3,Sun Jun 14 16:23:33 2015 UTC,"Some people mentioned Bravely Default already, but to elaborate on how it's used there...  When you defend (or ""Default"" as the game calls it), you save your turn for that character, up to a max of a few turns.  It's particularly useful in scenarios where that character doesn't really have anything to do, but might later, such as a White Mage who doesn't have anyone to heal on this turn.  It's also useful in scenarios where you're fighting a boss who's in some invulnerable mode (similar to the Mist Dragon in FFIV).  And then there's the scenario where you know an enemy will take a few hits to knock out, so you defend for a few turns until you have exactly the number of turns needed to take them out, thus reducing the overall damage you take throughout the fight.  But in most games, yeah, it's often unnecessary."
JRPG,39t8w5,gjohn34,5,Sun Jun 14 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty darn useful in Tales games, and to a lesser extent, SMT games.  I think mileage varies between different devs and series."

JRPG,39t8w5,Shihali,2,Mon Jun 15 00:17:23 2015 UTC,"If a game adds a mechanic that it doesn't use, then that's a sign of a bad game design choice.  Many good games use it as a method of developing strategy. For example, its common in games like Persona that have weaknesses you want to avoid getting hit with (and guard does that). Or, ARPGs like Tales, where guard acts as a crucial way of keeping momentum and health.  Guard is a strategic maneuver. Like most strategies, its typically not a necessary strategy. In parts of games where strategy is minimal (grinding), you'll see guard used a lot less."
JRPG,39t8w5,MustreadNews,2,Mon Jun 15 01:17:26 2015 UTC,It's for when the only attack types you have will buff the enemy.
JRPG,39t8w5,methamp,2,Sun Jun 14 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"The first two games I thought of were Bravely Default and Legend of Dragoon. In BD, I don't remember if Default was the equivalent to defend, but I used it heavily to deal large amounts of damage in a single move.  Legend of Dragoon the Guard/Defend turn served two purposes-it reduced the amount of damage your characters took and it restored HP. Not enough to turn the battle, but it helped out in a pinch. I wish more RPG's had additional functions other than reducing damages the next turn."
JRPG,39t8w5,Jamaz,2,Sun Jun 14 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"Bravely Default's ""Default"" is  kind of a parallel to Defend. It's easily the most stand out implementation of it (that I've seen) due to the importance of the option within the Brave & Default system.   To clarify for those that don't know: You don't just pass a turn and reduce damage.. you reduce damage and save that turn to spend later, since you can have multiple turns per character, consecutively."
JRPG,39t8w5,corymatthews423,2,Sun Jun 14 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"Beyond 7th Saga, in which choosing ""defend"" doubles your attack power on the next turn, players complain that there is no ""defend"" command to easily pass a turn in Final Fantasy I and II. In FFI you often want to pass turns in late-game random battles to get in more healing with the Heal Staff and Heal Helmet. In FFII, which has an action-based experience system, players often wish they could pass turns to give more experience to one character without needing to incapacitate the others."

JRPG,39t8w5,beigemore,2,Sun Jun 14 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"Games with better combat usually has ""defend"" offer other mechanics like healing a percentage of health or regenerating resources. If games have threat like MMOs, just mitigating damage on the tank is also very useful. Usually defend becomes rather useless if you love grinding and just become so powerful it's a waste of time to bother with any damage mitigation whatsoever."
JRPG,39t8w5,JoelStickney,2,Sun Jun 14 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"For the most part I agree with you, but I have learned that in certain games defend can actually be useful at times."
JRPG,39t8w5,gamesterx23,2,Sun Jun 14 22:00:27 2015 UTC,What? No! There are many games where you can't even survive without it. Defend allows you to not get rekt when you're opponent decides to Deathblow you.
JRPG,39t8w5,Macon1234,2,Mon Jun 15 09:34:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you're playing.  Persona is a series that shows how it go from basically useless (1), to exploitably broken (2), to missing (3, 3 FES), to actually a reasonable feature and a strategically decent thing to do (3 Portable, 4, 4 Golden).  So why? In Persona (SMT: Persona, because I never played Revelations: Persona), it's the very standard ""Guard"" action. It has no benefits except reducing damage done to you. Okay, you can use that in the select circumstance of keeping a party member alive for EXP... however, Persona's experience formula doesn't require you to stay alive. It relies on damage you do and actions you take. I still think it's a weird formula.  Persona 2 (PSP), would be better because ""Guard"" is much like P1, except the experience formula is more standard: fixed per member that stayed alive. But then they broke it by allowing you to choose ""Guard"" while it's your enemy's turn and ""cancel"" back into menus after they move and choosing an attack.  The system was probably there so you can re-arrange your turn order for ""fusion skills"", but it's completely exploitable.  Persona 3 (and FES) just removed it and switched to a ""Wait"" command. No damage reduction or canceling of weakness.  Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4, and Persona 4 Golden all add back ""Guard"" when they updated the ""One More"" system to the way I think is most useful and least broken. In P3 and P4, if you get a critical hit or attack an enemy's weakness, you get another turn. That's ""One More"". The enemies get the same. So if you know the enemy might target a certain person's weakness, you select ""Guard"" and the damage will be reduced and they will not get another turn. Any common enemy who can exploit your weakness is a decent candidate for using ""Guard"" in these games."
JRPG,39t8w5,cerialthriller,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"If you're grinding and the weaker person always attacks first but you don't need their attack to one shot the encounter... Or a boss is almost dead but the person that's going to kill it always attacks last and everyone is about to die, etc. It's situational but is useful if you actually know what you're doing.  In Bravely Default it's a huge part of the game."

Grandia 2 did guarding right. It only lasts a few seconds and you have to guard right before a hit connects, but the defense bonus is insane making blocking viable in ANY battle if you want to mitigate damage taken."
JRPG,39t8w5,Zilveari,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:46:07 2015 UTC,I know of plenty of RPGs that guarding often is very important
JRPG,39t8w5,Black-Lilith,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:00:38 2015 UTC,Depends on the game. Like the SE games that have ATB defend brings your next turn quicker and some games like persona depend heavily on blocking against weakness. I'm playing bravely default now and defend is very useful
JRPG,39sqrh,therm0pyle,7,Sun Jun 14 12:02:25 2015 UTC,"Agarest is a series of strategy JRPGs by Idea Factory. 1 and Zero originally launched on PS3 but have since been ported to 360, Windows, Android, and iOS. 2 has only been released on PS3 and Windows so far.  Note that the bundle price is 19.79 but buying all the titles + the Premium Edition upgrade for 1 only adds up to $16.76. If you're interested, but this in pieces to save $3 over the bundle price.  Right now I've only got the first one. I fired it up to see if I'd like it enough to buy the others, but the first is really bad mechanically. It's extremely tedious in combat right off the bat, and from the reading I'm doing that doesn't get any better at all. The characters and dialogue feel very stilted as well, though again I'm just at the beginning.  Anybody play the series and able to weigh in on each title? From what I'm reading, 1 and 0 play the same, but 2 changes things up. I'm interested in any opinions about whether 2 might be worth buying for somebody who found 1 to not be worthwhile."
JRPG,39sqrh,Griffith,8,Sun Jun 14 12:10:55 2015 UTC,"I bought this some time during the great drought of jRPGs after Microsoft stopped financing them and while the concept and initial appeal seemed nice I ultimately consider them a waste of time.  In theory, an RPG that spans multiple generations of heroes in which you try to couple heroes to grow a stronger new generation of heroes in a tactics RPG seems interesting. In practice, it's a fan-service intensive game with little in the way of combat mechanics, nonsensical lineups for power attacks and visual novel elements.  If you missed the sale on Valkyria Chronicles and were thinking of picking this up instead, I'd honestly advise against it."
JRPG,39sqrh,Griffith,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:18:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've got Valkyria Chronicles as well. I already had it on PS3 but at $5 the PC version with all the DLC, better graphics, and 60FPS was impossible to resist.  Have you played all three Agarest games or are your comments based on the first one only?"
JRPG,39sqrh,Griffith,2,Sun Jun 14 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"I own all of them... I had played a bit of the first one and the second and third (prequel) were available at a very low price, close to the current sales price with the collector's goodies so I figured I might as well grab them.  If I remember correctly, Agarest 2 is considered the best one of the three but the combat system is significantly different. Agarest zero is a prequel of the first, but I may be wrong. Might be worth googling for discussions regarding the games.  Agarest games are kind of like the poor man's Disgaea. If you really enjoyed Disgaea and want something a bit similar but with worse writing and gameplay and... well, almost everything, Agarest are the games for you."
JRPG,39sqrh,silverhydra,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"2 is the one with the different combat system. Zero is a prequel and plays the same as 1. The release order was 1, Zero, 2.  It'd be amazing if the Disgaea series came to PC. With the increase of Japanese games being released on PC it might be more likely nowadays. I actually love the Vita as a portable sRPG device since the genre really fits an on-the-go device quite well, but supposedly starting with Disgaea 5 they won't be releasing them on that anymore due to the technical constraints related to the massive increase in units they're adding."

JRPG,39sqrh,AxelVermillion,8,Sun Jun 14 19:36:09 2015 UTC,"Since it seems like this thread is shitting on the series, allow me to offer my rebuttal for Agarest 2. Never played Agarest Zero and if y'all want to shit on Agarest 1 you have my blessings.  As for Agarest 2 I think it is worth the $7 if you like tactical JRPGs. I'll get the bad out of the way first:   The tutorials suck. This time around they did tell you enough to at least know of some stuff and make use of it but you definitely don't get a mastery of it anytime soon; this normally isn't bad but those tome things you use to learn spells are irreversible and sometimes bite you in the ass later in the game The male protagonists ALL suck. You start off with the main guy and sorta dislike him then his kid is a huge cunt you end up hating until you get the grandkid who is such an empty shell of a character you wish the cunt was back because at least he was honest. The female protagonists and your main bro Jainus are good enough to hold the series together though (and you can 'revive' any character lost by the passage of time if you want to keep them in your roster), god I love Jainus There is a true and a bad ending and the bad ending leaves a real bitter taste in your mouth; the true ending requires you hitting certain events all throughout the game so if you miss one you're screwed. Really bad mechanic there Unnecessary fan service; you rub oil on people's boobies and they get increased stats. You cannot rub Jainus's pecs. Despite the mind-bogging number of potential move combinations you may end up just using one or two combinations which reliably kill almost everything on the screen. I ended up clearing most of the end-game content with only two combos; a single target damaging one and a large AOE group ground-pound (which was fun to watch) (Edit) How could I forget? The story sucks balls   Good parts though:   For a tactical JRPG it's pretty forgiving at the start and that weird positional linking system they had in Agarest 1 that made me contemplate throwing my laptop out the window has been scrapped There are a lot of spells, combinations of spells, different areas for the spells to hit (ex. a line, a rectangle, a diamond pattern) and selectively choosing your target and killing others feels very rewarding There is a time-sensitive aspect in the game when doing your turns, but it isn't too strict. If anything it makes you think and work faster which, paired with the animation, actually kept me tuned into the game for a long time The enemies do have different weaknesses and resistances for elements (ex. weak to fire but absorbs water) and for states (you have moves that knock enemies down, keep them standing, or knock them in the air). This allows you to choose moves that are stronger on certain enemies but it isn't drastic enough of a change to really prevent you from killing them There's enough battle animation to keep stuff interesting but not too much to make it seem overwhelming, even grinding trash mobs for drops was pretty fun   So for a completionist it may not be the best game but for somebody who just wants to kill things, get a bit technical but not too much, and waste a bunch of time it is definitely a great deal for seven bucks. I only played through the game once on medium difficulty but since I took my time screwing around and grinding it took 80+ hours; I paid full price and feel it was worth it."
JRPG,39sqrh,godlyhalo,3,Sun Jun 14 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"Too bad the first one was the only really good one. The second one (Zero) improved mechanics for sure, and the backstory of the first game was kind of interesting, but it was incredibly short, and the vacation days where you literally do nothing but mess around in town were kind of offputting, as well as how they took out what I thought was pretty cool in the dungeons where you could walk around in them--instead they're just maps inside of maps. They also took out the customizability factor because the first game was five generations while Zero is only two generations, so that was also a big negative for me.  As far as Agarest 2 is concerned, I haven't played it, and I never intend on playing it. The combat looks awful, like they decided it needed to be an action game all of a sudden, and I still don't know and don't want to know the context behind the full 3D animated dancing scenes.  tl;dr: They had an amazing premise at the start, but allowed it to worsen with fanservice more and more as the series went on."
JRPG,39sqrh,EzioSC5,2,Sun Jun 14 14:08:36 2015 UTC,"this :v  I've finished first one with 99,99% completion, but I got tired after play zero. got bored.  I also just got refund for agarest 2. only played it for some minutes and didnt get me interested. boring mc and complex battle mechanic."
JRPG,39sqrh,mysticrudnin,3,Sun Jun 14 14:48:58 2015 UTC,"So here is my opinion on the series. I've played 1 to near completion, minus a few things post-endgame. It has an amazing story that literally spans hundreds of years, tons of unique and interesting characters, and the ending feels justified and satisfying. The combat is actually quite a lot of fun, offering a wide variety of combo attacks and strategies. My biggest complain about combat would be that in post-game, all strategy is thrown out the window and you are forced to use cheese tactics in order to beat bosses. Overall, a great game, especially for the price, I've played it 200 hours if that says anything....  As for Agarest Zero, Mechanically the exact same game as the first, with a few minor UI changes. The real drawback is that they didn't change enough to make it feel like a different game. The most interesting part is that you have the option to load a save file from the original Agarest. If you load a true end save file, you literally have the option to play through the entire story of the first game (with no random battles).  Agarest 2: Played a bit, wish I could refund it. It has a terrible and incredibly complex combat which after 2 hours of playing it, I still couldn't figure out the basics of combat. Even the tutorials didn't help. Combat didn't feel good at all, it felt very clunky and overall just didn't have the same fun factor as the other two games.  My recommendation, get Agarest Zero and find a true end save file online for the first game. The only benefits you get are some money, some gear, and the option to play through the story of the first game. Avoid 2 like the plague."
JRPG,39sqrh,Nez_Zai,2,Sun Jun 14 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"You can also play through the first Agarest game without random battles by just finishing Agarest Zero, it unlocks in NG+. But I'm going to go ahead and disagree with you, because a big part of the fun of the first game is building your next generation's hero, and being able to tweak what weapons and elements he'll use based on his lineage. The version of Agarest you play in Zero doesn't let you pick, and the hero each generation is just boring big sword basic arts guy. Also, if you want to use all the party members, you have to buy DLC, last I checked."
JRPG,39sqrh,Dayeon,2,Sun Jun 14 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard the other ones do better, but I've played the first one and didn't really like it. As mentioned, in theory it's cool, but in practice it just didn't work out. I think I'll pick them up anyway though.  The combat system is nifty in that it's unique, but it really never gets interesting. So maybe the other game eventually get better?"
JRPG,39sqrh,Sighto,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:07:36 2015 UTC,"I've been doing more reading after my first post. 2 has a very revamped and improved combat system. I'd still like some input from anybody that has played both 1 and 2, but at this point I think I'll probably grab 2 and skip 1 and 0."

JRPG,39peoi,TheDreamIsDeader,17,Sat Jun 13 13:37:53 2015 UTC,"Focusing on people's opinions is bound to be a dead end.  Some people like both games, some neither.  Seems more productive to focus on what is critically and commercially appealing--and why.  That said, I enjoyed both games, and it's pretty clear to me that Xenoblade did learn a lot from FF12 (it had plenty of time to--they were released nearly five years apart).  FF12's shortcoming is probably more from swapping directors mid-production and having corporate bosses shoehorn an irrelevant character as the main protagonist to appeal to a younger demographic.  It's the equivalent of swapping Yuri out with a 16 year-old HS student in Tales of Vesperia.  I'll be as curious as anyone how FF15 corrects course."
JRPG,39peoi,countblah2,6,Sat Jun 13 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Since the other comments (thus far) are praise for one or the other, but not both, I'll chime in that you're not alone. I got ~200 hours of enjoyment each from XII and Xenoblade, and consider both to be console-making games; that is, for the number of hours of enjoyment I got out of each game, they justified the purchase of the console (and I'm planning on buying a Wii U for X). I don't tend to think too much about the game mechanics, plus it's been years since I've played either, but both games were fun, and kept me playing. I have so many good JRPGs (FFX, Tales of Graces, Ni No Kuni, Last Story) where I'm only 10-20 hours in because they haven't hooked me yet. But XII and Xenoblade kept me coming back night after night, for months. To me, that's the measure of a great game."

There's lots of flaws in Xenoblade that aren't there in FF12. I'll admit the story is more developed and the amount of side content is larger, but the basic game system just feels really bland."

I played it for a bit, enjoyed what I could, conquered the battle system (ie: got through the shock of the battle system) and then I made the mistake of seeing what it looked like on the Wii. The UI is so much better and makes so much since that once i returned to the portable version, it all sort of felt claustrophobic."
JRPG,39peoi,gabriel_larkins,27,Wed Jun 17 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"Is that why I got downvoted to hell when I suggested FFXII on the Xenoblade subreddit?  I'll never understand the hate for FFXII. Sure the cast wasn't the best in the series, but the battle system was addictive and the dialogue was all razor-sharp. Also Basch and Balthier bring enough swagger to the table to make up for the rest of the party being relatively lackluster."
JRPG,39peoi,FoozleMoozle,6,Sat Jun 13 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for everyone, but I can tell you why I didn't like FFXII.  Vann was annoying (in a way that was admittedly similar to Titus) and didn't seem to have much purpose.  While the combat system itself was fun, I found the leveling system to be needlessly obfuscated; I like to plan out how my characters are going to progress ahead of time, which was only remotely possible by looking up a giant map of the grid.  And finally (and most importantly), while I've heard that the game's characters become really engaging and interesting, it takes entirely too long for that to happen (longer than I had patience for).    And really, I feel this is the biggest problem with jrpgs nowadays: pacing.  It takes entirely too long for them to get to the meat of the game.  I think this trend has largely coincided with space restrictions no longer really being a big deal."
JRPG,39peoi,gabriel_larkins,3,Sun Jun 14 01:35:38 2015 UTC,"See, Vaan didn't really bother me, although I agree he was without purpose (although he would have gained plenty if the game has actually had the third act it was supposed to have). Penelo is really the offender when it comes to wasted party slots.  FFXII is not a perfect game, and has its flaws mostly due to studio intervention and development issues, but I feel the final product still had a lot of merit that is often overlooked."
JRPG,39peoi,FoozleMoozle,4,Sun Jun 14 01:55:46 2015 UTC,"He also lacked purpose because wasn't the original intention of FF12 to have Basch as the main character but that didn't sit well with the Japanese audience because (at the time at least) they preferred their androgynous teen protagonists, so Vaan was thrown in the game to appease them"
JRPG,39peoi,gabriel_larkins,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:13:25 2015 UTC,I can definitely agree with that; it's a game I really want to give another shot if I ever find myself with a good chunk of time to spend on it.

His characterization is subtle, and he is just kind of the ""lone warrior badass"" trope through most of the game, but he had his moral code that he was passionate about without trying to force it on Tidus or Yuna.   However, the whole twist about him in the last act of the game blows a huge hole in the game's well-established world and makes him a thoroughly unbelievable character, which messes that up pretty hardcore.  I would highly suggest retrying 12 if the License Board was what turned you away. Looking at it with fresh eyes I think you'll find that it isn't all that complex and offers some great customization options."

I have an old Phenom II quad that set me back about £60. Go for single/dual core power, mine is about 3.8ghz, PCSX2 (ps2) and Dolphin (gc/wii) can use two CPU cores but don't expect it to use more. You're better off with a solid 1 or 2 physical core CPU than some expensive hyperthreading shit that the emulator can't use anyway.  Graphics don't need to be amazing, I have an ancient 6990 that will run Xenoblade and FFX/XII that cost me around £60 again.   Don't expect it to play Shadow of the Colossus or Valkyrie Profile 2, I don't think anything can, but anything else is fair game.

I've always considered the Monado to be one of the main characters and the way it develops as well as the way the world opens up through the game was incredible.  FF12 just never really did it for me. I didn't find the story all that interesting and Balthier and Fran were the only two characters I really cared about. It was huge but it suffered from uninspiring areas like desert/savannah/tundra everywhere. Getting around in game was a pain also, having to find crystals and having limited teleports felt needlessly cumbersome.   If I'm completely honest I haven't completed either game.

Standing around waiting for your character to auto attack, but not being able to move away and dodge an enemy attack just struck me as taking the disadvantages of real time and turn based with none of the good points of either. Xenoblade does a good job making positioning relevant, and giving you enough powers that you are usually doing something instead of sitting and watching, but I would still prefer a proper turn based system any day. What made me play through it was the story, which smartly gave me a strong hook, and paced itself well around letting me explore some fantastic looking areas. And the characters, who are all likeable and interesting. FF12's real deal breaker was actually the camera being inverted on the X-axis. Who does that? It was so annoying just trying to look around."
JRPG,39peoi,AceAttorneyt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"For the Xenoblade boss, you might consider switching up your party and grinding just a few levels. I use Melia(controlled)/Sharla/Riki and it takes a while but it gets done. Actually, literally earlier today I used that party and got it done. Let Melia have an Aqua summoned at all times, give Sharla all the healing arts, and Riki whatever you want. I was level 75.  For the grinding, there are two ways. One way is to go back through all the areas in the game looking for new sidequests. If you haven't been doing the sidequests throughout the game, most of the useful quests aren't open to you. The other way is to grind on enemies. One easy enemy is the level 73+ Gogols, on Bionis' Leg, northwest of Raguel Bridge. Should give a decent amount of experience.  This is all just if you even care to finish the game, and I would highly recommend doing so. The plot has a couple more tricks up its sleeve."

Bionis Interior is pretty but the enemies there are kinda boring to grind.  I've thoroughly enjoyed this game so far and will definitely give it another shot.

She summons Nebula which have a pretty high resistance to physical attacks, but you can also ignore the Nebulae outright if you have strong ether attacks. You have to control her because the AI is content to use her Summons as buffs rather than attacks, which doesn't help at all.  One thing to do to buff her attack power is to give her an Electric Plus gem and level up Summon Bolt very high. Should be a very consistent source of damage."

Specifically, when you first meet Basch, and you think to yourself, ""Ok, this is going to be a tale of regret and redemption. This character is going to be great!""

That said, Xenoblade does a massively better job than FF12 at having a cast that is likable, relateable, and seems immediately important to the overall story. I won't say I never see complaints about FF12's mechanics, but far and away the biggest issues I see with the game from the community is that the cast isn't important or interesting and the plot was boring. As part of the community that fell in love with the genre for its storytelling and likes a good cast more than just about any other aspect of a JRPG, FF12 just wasn't my thing.  I do think there are problems with the gameplay as well, but they aren't the biggest problems. In order for me to love an RPG with a story or cast I don't care about, the gameplay needs to be damn near flawless, and FF12...isn't.  Edit: Clarification."

JRPG,39peoi,_SnakeDoctor,4,Sat Jun 13 13:55:22 2015 UTC,"Nah. Games are a perfectly valid way to explore storytelling BECAUSE they're interactive.   Despite how silly it may sound, ""gameplay"" isn't the core feature of video games. That would be interactivity.   What makes video games unique is that they're an interactive digital medium, and how developers choose to engage the player is what makes them interesting. Maybe they choose to make their game a visual novel where the only interactivity is the ability to advance text and make a few key story decisions. There may not be a ton of player input, but that's fine. It's still as much as game as an RPG or FPS simply because it has the interactive element."

The best games do a good job of meshing the two without making it feel like one is being ignored for the sake of the other.   It's apples and oranges anyway. I don't think every game needs 200 hours of filler content, which was an issue I think both FFXII and Xenoblade suffer for, and I don't really like exploring big empty worlds for the sake of doing so. I get that some people do, but I like a little bit more narrative focus and don't mind some railroading for the sake of pacing.   Pretty easy to see why XII wasn't my thing."

I don't like XII because the battle menu is cumbersome, battle animations are lack luster at best(aside from scathe) I don't like buying spells & I also didn't care for the liscence board.  Xenoblades battle pallete is the opposite of cumbersome just scroll up & down the pallette for your skis, no submenus or anything like that. Skill trees are simple and straight forward, animations are great, especially the 7th party members, attacks like Final cross and other laser attacks are a spectacle to behold.

JRPG,39peoi,Arronwy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly while people get on XII's case about Vaan and the license system and other stuff, for me the Gambit system and its ties to actual combat is the biggest flaw.  Even in IZJS, which was leagues better than FFXII, setting up a Gambit system that covers all necessary reactions for one battle is a nightmare, takes forever, and often isn't even possible (you'll just have to hope no one gets poisoned or something). The fact that you couldn't even get close to trying until halfway through the game is terrible. And god help you if you want to set up your party in a way that will take you through one endgame dungeon or exploit different elemental weaknesses -- the space for logic just isn't there. There aren't nearly enough Gambit slots and not nearly enough types of reactions to program in.  The idea to be able to really accurately determine your allies' AI is great. The arbitrary limits placed on it absolutely kills its potential. Xenoblade has great ally AI for the most part, and even in the worst case scenario (Sharla/Melia) they at least act appropriately, if not ideally. Meanwhile in the game about customizing ally AI, I can never get any ally to act nearly as intelligently.  Being able to directly give commands kind of helps, but then the clunkyness of the menus is a huge problem. Even on the slowest setting, the time it takes to get to my ally's command is a lot of time wasted while Zodiac or whoever whittles away my health."

JRPG,39peoi,christmascake,3,Sat Jun 13 14:29:38 2015 UTC,Just because Xenoblade took some inspiration from 12 doesn't mean they are the same game.  What made 12's battle system so bad for me is how boring it was for melee characters.  Their abilities were useless so you just auto attacked.  Mages had a little more to do but they ran out of mana so fast I still found myself bored.    Xenoblade completely fixed these problems by giving everyone dynamic and interesting cooldown based abilities.  For me this took the template 12 created and actually made it fun.     Therefore I feel completely justified in loving Xenoblade and disliking 12 thank you very much.
JRPG,39peoi,_SnakeDoctor,3,Sat Jun 13 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. Despite some similarities in combat, these are wildly different games with different strengths, weaknesses, and focus. Game mechanics, cast, story, and world design are all enormously important areas where these games differ.  Ultimately, they both feel like they draw their inspiration from MMO combat anyway, and Xenoblade takes that even further with its cooldown-based ability system and quest design. I doubt it's the case that Xenoblade couldn't exist without FF12, and even if it was, I think Xenoblade did it better in nearly every area. If you're looking for an explanation of how they actually differ, look at the variety in Xenoblade's abilities between characters. Look at the integration of mechanics like toppling enemies, blocking enemy abilities with the Monado, setting up huge combos as Melia. FF12, on the other hand, has Gambits and the same abilities Final Fantasy has always had. And then there's the more obvious differences, like environment design, questing, characters, storyline, etc.   They're just too different to expect people to automatically like both, and personally, I have a lot of problems with FF12's gameplay and story that I don't have with Xenoblade.  And I definitely don't agree that all RPGs should be following the example set by FF12 and Xenoblade. Should all shooters be like Uncharted, or should they all be like GTA? Should all platformers be like Mario or Braid? Street Fighter or Marvel vs Capcom? Nooooo no no no, there is so much more diversity that's possible through games, even in JRPGs. It's important to try to separate what you like in individual games, rather than generalizing away their minutia by just looking at their broad direction. FF13 and FFX are barely even comparable IMO, its just that people had specific issues with FF13's implementation (primarily cast, game design pacing, and combat - things FFX did well). You can't assume that because you didn't like one game that it's entire philosophy should be thrown away."
JRPG,39peoi,AceAttorneyt,3,Sat Jun 13 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"You make a good point about FFX and FFXIII. I love both games, though FFX was my first RPG/FF so it has a more nostalgiac place in my heart. FFXIII is constantly panned for its linearity, but FFX is critically acclaimed. Yet FFX most definitely follows the ""walk down hallway...four random encounters...then cutscene"" formula that FFXIII did. My only issue with FFXIII is that the training wheels came off way too late for combat. The game gets incredibly strategic, but not until you get to chapter 10/11.    I personally loved FFXIII and thought the sequels were a waste of money."
JRPG,39peoi,AceAttorneyt,3,Sat Jun 13 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of context involved. FFX was the line-up of one of the most successful console ever. It sold at several millions, securing a huge fanbase, it was for a lot of people their very first JRPG, essentially for Europe if they didn't tackle the FF trilogy first.  FFX is also a more likeable game, it is easier to follow through the game and the story and they're not trying some funny stuff with a antipathetic cast that doesn't like each other.   FFX never really tried a new formula, it stayed with the tried-and-true, focusing instead on the capabilities of the Playstation 2 with motion-cap, facial emotion and voice acting and it worked.  Also, FFX's progression was smoother, it doesn't make you feel like you're in tutorial for a long time like FFXIII, yet you still unlock some new stuff until at least Guadosalam and even further than that considering how the key spheres can limit your capabilities (and how scarce these spheres were in the main story)."

FF12 had a politics high plot, which turned many people away, but its biggest issue was the cast, 2 characters were actually just outright crap and badly written and many of the others lacked depth or just weren't interesting to boot.  People might love Xenoblade more because they had zero expectations, it was from a new company, a new IP, it wasn't resting atop 20 years of established games in a series.  Its also about timing, FF12 released when consoles contained basically ZERO WRPGS or open world games, now they're everywhere and so Xenoblade florishes.  This all said, Xenoblade sold rather badly in comparison to FF12, even its rerelease hasn't done as well as it should have. Great games undermined by bad timing and bad system decisions."

I also didn't like it at first for the same reason, but it ended up being one of my favorite JRPGs.  I liked the characters, the story and the world, everithing was consistent. Even penelo and vaan were usefull to introduce the story and the world, since they were not involved in the conflict at first.   The world was more open than xenoblade's. Xenoblade had bigger areas but there were only one entry and one exit, overall it was quite linear. In FFXII you could go almost everywere if you were stong enough, you didn't have to progress the story to explore the map.  Also, FFXII quests were not as generic as Xenoblade's, some of them were actually pretty good, especially the mob hunting. And the same goes for the equipment.  Overall I think FFXII is the best of the two. But I liked playing both."
JRPG,39peoi,m00fire,2,Sat Jun 13 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"FFXII left me with absolutely no positive feelings and no negative feelings. I didn't hate the combat, but I didn't love it either. The world was intriguing in concept, but didn't suck me in like I hoped it would in the opening cutscenes. The characters are fairly fleshed out, but aside from Balthier I found them frustratingly dull and uninspiring. A more mature plot focused around political struggles sounded right up my alley, but it was paced terribly and fell far short of what I hoped it would be. (The art is the one exception, I loved the art style of FFXII).  I played ~20 hours of the International version, and though I didn't feel any urges to finish it, the improvements in several aspects of the game makes me feel that, had I played it first, I might not rank FFXII as the worst game in the series. Anyone who hasn't played FFXII should seek out the International version, in my opinion.  Basically, FFXII is the epitome of mediocre to me. And that is honestly more disappointing than a game that has some good elements and some atrocious elements."
JRPG,39peoi,JRPGFan,2,Sat Jun 13 20:50:57 2015 UTC,I don't see how it's wrong to hate FF12 and love Xenoblade.  They're completely different games.
JRPG,39peoi,Hellwyrm,2,Sat Jun 13 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know what you're talking about. FFXIII sold more than FFXII and Xenoblade, and was indeed met with critical acclaim.  That and the stories told in a lot of JRPGs are as well very important and intrinsically tied to their success. Most of Squares games come to mind, as well as many other great companies, eastern or western. Gameplay is important too but you can't disregard either one."
JRPG,39peoi,JRPGFan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"I never talked about commercial success. I only talked about the critical success of FF13 which wasn't as high as Xenoblade.  I also never said that story should be disregarded. I'm just saying that the way of focusing everything into the story to the point that it takes down key elements of a JRPG is what Takahashi sought to avoid.  JRPGs focusing on the gameplay is also tied to their success. Star Ocean, the SaGa franchise, Valkyrie Profile, those are also games that put a huge emphasis on the gameplay."
JRPG,39peoi,m00fire,2,Sun Jun 14 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I hated FFXII at first. Then I played it a few years later and enjoyed it. Once I got access to all Gambits, I found the game really enjoyable. I prefer Xenoblade due to its simplicity and the fact that it felt more streamlined, but Xenoblade was missing one thing...  The Gambit system! Why has no one else picked this mechanic up? It's brilliant! It drives me nuts to see such a good mechanic ignored by other developers, including Square Enix itself (Gambits could have done wonders in FFXIII). Gambits are what I will always remember FFXII for. Such a great approach to AI."
JRPG,39peoi,Bisoromi,2,Sun Jun 14 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, I would love a well-implemented Gambit-type system that allowed me to define my ally's reactions. But I'm including FFXII and IZJS when I say that I still haven't seen one.   The fact that you need to get far into the game just to have 10 or however many slots is terrible, having to buy them is terrible, and even in IZJS when they expanded the selection, there aren't nearly enough choices to really be able to make allies act intelligently.  The fact that they even limited the number is silly."
JRPG,39peoi,m00fire,2,Sun Jun 14 00:44:18 2015 UTC,The gambits was incredibly shunned upon. Giving free reigns to the player is according to the fanbase a bad thing. It pushed people who had full control of the system to automate everything like they were obligated to.  I believe it's a brilliant system but it seems it just doesn't work out as it was the source of many complaints.
JRPG,39peoi,Bisoromi,2,Sun Jun 14 01:53:22 2015 UTC,"Gameplay first, story after was the most important thing for him   If that was his goal, he didn't do so hot with Xenoblade. The gameplay is essentially that of a simplified MMO (without the second M, of course).   The combat relies around auto attacks and repetitively hitting abilities in rotations as they come off cooldowns. The quest system was so boring and unimaginative that (until someone told me otherwise) I actually thought the quests were randomly generated. Then there's the staple huge open zones with very little actually occupying them.  The story and music are honestly the only reasons I sunk 30 hours into the game. But even those weren't enticing enough to warrant another 30+ hours of that gameplay."

JRPG,39peoi,JRPGFan,4,Sun Jun 14 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe the praise Xenoblade gets. People trash FF13 for being linear, but I will take that any day over a huge open world filled with nothing."
JRPG,39peoi,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Sun Jun 14 05:38:20 2015 UTC,"You're the first person I've ever come across who shares my opinion. All the praise I ever see for Xenoblade is for how ""open"" it is, but I would give anything for it to be linear and throw out all the pointless, boring roaming around an empty, forgettable wasteland."
JRPG,39peoi,JRPGFan,3,Sat Jun 13 18:27:13 2015 UTC,"xenoblade focused on a cast of characters i liked, whereas ff12 focused on a political struggle i didn't give a shit about. that is the biggest difference. but xenoblade also had better combat. sure, both games automated ordinary attacks, but xenoblade kept you on your toes with the skill rotations and the visions. ff12 i just kinda coasted through, unless i was way underleveled.   Today, we're getting a resurgence of jrpgs focusing on gameplay, exploration, sidequests over linear stories, everything FF12 focused on.   we are? can you rattle them off? there's legend of legacy, and i hear xenoblade x is story-light relative to xenoblade, but i am otherwise drawing a blank on post-2010, purposefully story-light jrpgs."
JRPG,39peoi,JRPGFan,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:05:16 2015 UTC,"Focus on exploration and gameplay doesn't mean story-light. FF12 isn't story-light, it just had a bigger focus on gameplay. Unlike FF10 or 13."
JRPG,39peoi,Andralexis,2,Sat Jun 13 14:17:58 2015 UTC,Did Xenoblade outsell Final Fantasy 13?
JRPG,39peoi,Metatron-X,3,Sat Jun 13 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"no, not even close. FF13 on ps3 / xbox 360 alone sold 6 million or so copies. Xenoblade didn't even hit 1 million on wii I don't think."
JRPG,39peoi,JRPGFan,5,Sat Jun 13 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine so. PS3 and Xbox360 were bigger platforms than the Wii so I'd expect FF13 to have sold more.  Also, FF is a far bigger IP than Xeno so more people will have been familiar with the game. also I remember seeing a lot more advertising for FF13.  Edit: By critically I think he meant according to critics. Commercial success is when something sells better."
JRPG,39peoi,CinnamonJ,3,Sun Jun 14 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well, critically FF13 had higher expectations from critics, being a main game in the Final Fantasy franchise. I don't think the comparison is fair and commercially, I have no doubt that FF13 did better than Xenoblade."
JRPG,39peoi,Best_Poro,-2,Sat Jun 13 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"Wait a second.  You claim that it is unfair to compare them critically and then proceed to compare them commercially, a game released on PS3, X360 and Steam with a game released on the Wii?"
JRPG,39peoi,Supertoby2008,5,Sat Jun 13 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"OP made the first comparison which led us down that path. Perhaps we shouldn't compare them at all outside of gameplay. From my perspective, they both play like offline MMO's which was fresher in 2006 than it was in 2011."
JRPG,39peoi,_SnakeDoctor,2,Sat Jun 13 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound like a tool, but that was really well said."

JRPG,39peoi,sisko4,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"Wait   It's the beginning of the end for jRPGs if they are classed in this manner. A lot of people play them for the escapism aspect. Critically evaluating them in this way devalues them. They are all cheesy and unrealistic, yet lovable. Music and story are the critical components, good gameplay is a requirement."
JRPG,39peoi,DisplacedLondoner,2,Sat Jun 13 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Cheesy and unrealistic isn't necessarily a problem, but insufferable characters and writing is. There's a fine line between camp and crap."
JRPG,39peoi,opiumized,2,Sat Jun 13 18:38:25 2015 UTC,Only if it ruins the experience. I never felt it in Xenoblade but Vaan and Penelo definitely felt boring and lacked cheese and unrealism along with pretty much everything. Balthier and Fran were better characters but only because they had cool voices. Xenoblade actually brought me into the game whereas FF12 just felt like things happening.
JRPG,39peoi,life036,2,Sat Jun 13 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I felt quite similarly, most of FF12's important story happens miles away from your party. The entire game's vision (storywise) was compromised when Matsuno left, and it's well documented (Vaan replacing Basch as the MC , Vaan and Penelo being late additions etc)."

JRPG,39peoi,Hemmer83,2,Sat Jun 13 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade Chronicles X.  Really shouldn't be abbreviated as XBX because Xenoblade is one word with no camelcase on the ""B"". But that's kind of nitpicky."
JRPG,39n9w4,CSFFlame,6,Fri Jun 12 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"No Japanese text, but yes to Japanese  audio.  Looks like they don't want reverse importing... which is odd for a steam game..."
JRPG,39n9w4,SoftandPretty,6,Fri Jun 12 23:25:47 2015 UTC,I wish more developers would support the Japanese region more. :<  It would be really nice Tales PC games would come to the Japanese region. I hope it does. I'm sure that there are many PC gamers in Japan that would enjoy Tales games.
JRPG,39n9w4,SoftandPretty,10,Sat Jun 13 06:33:09 2015 UTC,"It's finally happening. It's so wonderful to see such a wonderful RPG series on such a wonderful and important platform. I've emulated Tales games for years on the PC and I buy all of the console games.  But it's so much more wonderful to be able to do it legitimately where there aren't any moral or legal questions about it. This makes me happy to be a PC gamer and a Tales fan. It's so nice to be able to use PCs for Tales.   There's no RPG series I've ever hoped and dreamed of coming to Steam and the PC more than Tales. So this is one of the best of PC gaming news I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, this just makes me feel so wonderful I don't know where to start. This is so exciting as a big Tales and PC gaming fan."

JRPG,39l3kv,mjfz,6,Fri Jun 12 15:16:12 2015 UTC,These guys are making games faster than I can play them. It reminds me of the 90's with Final Fantasy.
JRPG,39l3kv,waspocracy,2,Fri Jun 12 16:36:53 2015 UTC,One every 2 years?
JRPG,39l3kv,Dan_Tsukasa,6,Fri Jun 12 18:39:33 2015 UTC,If you're in the US like me then:   Tales of Graces f - 2012 Tales of Xillia - 2013 Tales of Xillia 2 - 2014 Tales of Zestiria - 2015.    I still haven't started Xillia 2.
JRPG,39l3kv,waspocracy,2,Fri Jun 12 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Hearts R, but I think he was talking about Final Fantasy."
JRPG,39l3kv,kimpy7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"In I'm the EU, though japan gets a bigger gap, we just get shorter as they're always a game or so behind.  But for clarification I was talking about final fantasy sorry."
JRPG,39l3kv,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:32:48 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, right. Yeah, those still released faster than I could play them. Granted, I was rather stupid and didn't understand strategies when they were released."
JRPG,39l3kv,waspocracy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:29:14 2015 UTC,"That's because you have to wait for the English release, otherwise the wait really isn't as long as it's artificially made to look."
JRPG,39l3kv,Konflyk,2,Sat Jun 13 04:52:52 2015 UTC,Now to wait for the US.
JRPG,39l3kv,auragar,5,Fri Jun 12 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"This is a rare situation for us Europeans, having a JRPG announced for us but Americans are still waiting."

JRPG,39l3kv,corymatthews423,2,Fri Jun 12 17:48:40 2015 UTC,"I am just glad they finally confirmed it, there were already so many rumors this barely even counts as an announcement anymore.  Anyway, I will definitely be playing the PS4 version myself."
JRPG,39l3kv,paperjunkie,2,Fri Jun 12 14:47:42 2015 UTC,i wonder if this would fix the pop in issues that i noticed in trailer footage.
JRPG,39l3kv,flamearrestor,2,Fri Jun 12 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"As I'm not yet a PS4 owner, I only hope that the Collector's Edition (assuming there will be one) will be kind to us PS3 users. If not, it'll be yet another motivator to own a PS4 sooner which will open yet another portal in the backlog nexus..."
JRPG,39l3kv,Redheadkitten,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:46:29 2015 UTC,I got all excited about the announcement since I got the email.  Took me a good 10 minutes to remember that I'm subscribed to the EU Tales site since there isn't a US one...
JRPG,39l3kv,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"Look forward to the PS3 and PS4 release on the 16th of October and the PC Digital will release on the 20th, with English, Spanish, French, Italian and German subtitles, and English & Japanese voice overs. The PC and PS4 versions will also include, for the first time ever, Russian subtitles!    Hell yes Duel audio on all platforms! And er... Russian subs too."
JRPG,39l3kv,Vorgier,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"WHY ARE THEY STILL DEVELOPING ON THE PS3. Holy shit this type of ""news"" is just showing how bad console gaming is. Oh look, Berseria is going to have a PS3 version too. Way to get people who don't own PS4's to have a reason to own a PS4 and stick with their outdated hardware. The PS4 has been out for years. A game coming out on PS4 shouldn't be surprising or news. This fucking industry..."
JRPG,39l3kv,TheDeadlyFuzz,2,Sat Jun 13 12:43:02 2015 UTC,"Tales never really pushed the limits of it's hardware. Why take a huge profit cut and abandon the (larger) PS3 population?   I'll be getting it on PS4, but I can see their reasoning. I'm guessing PS4 exclusives are going to be more common in a year or two."
JRPG,39l3kv,De-Le-Metalica,2,Sat Jun 13 20:38:25 2015 UTC,"I hear Japan isn't jumping on-board with PS4 like the West is. So the PS3 version exists for their benefit, mainly."
JRPG,39iufe,meenor,15,Fri Jun 12 00:47:22 2015 UTC,If you're uncertain about picking up this game...pick it up. The story is great and the gameplay is super fun.
JRPG,39iufe,Flipperbw,3,Fri Jun 12 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"I found the story to be the weakest aspect, honestly. Just too melodramatic and childish. The game was a joy to control though."
JRPG,39iufe,Evrae_Altana,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:14:55 2015 UTC,It only gets worse in VC2 and 3.
JRPG,39iufe,BeardyDuck,2,Sat Jun 13 09:01:51 2015 UTC,"Fuck man, we need more of this!"
JRPG,39iufe,Darelius,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:45:02 2015 UTC,"I hated the rating system. It doesn't reward strategic play. You get the best rating by zerging through the map at objectives, disregarding the fact that your toon is getting a face full of bullets."
JRPG,39iufe,rafaelfy,2,Fri Jun 12 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"I cannot recommend this game enough. I can't speak for the PC version, but both my wife and I absolutely loved it on PS3. It feels a lot more fluid to me than most SRPGs because of the running and positioning of each soldier, but it still retains a turn-based feel. You have time to plan your actions, but it's faster paced than the usual TBS.  We loved the characters, loved the story, loved the gameplay. We got more than our money's worth as a full-priced PS3 game. 75% off an already discounted price is a steal."
JRPG,39iufe,Rurouni,6,Fri Jun 12 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"The PC port is absolutely solid and performance optimization should not be something you worry about. I would like to have seen a little more tweaking in terms of graphics just for the sake of people running on laptops/low end computers, but that being said the aesthetics of the game itself relies heavily on art style and not graphical fidelity. They have keyboard bindings, and as you would have expected, a third person shooter style games has absolutely no problem in mouse and keyboard.  It's not a piece of shit like the FF13 ports."
JRPG,39iufe,hayashirice911,2,Fri Jun 12 16:13:12 2015 UTC,Bought this today but probably wont be able to play until i build my computer. Something to look forward too. :)
JRPG,39iufe,Ruaric,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"my craptop is getting pretty old and pretty much unplayable without a cooling pad under it. I have no problem playing similar games like XCOM, but for some reason CIV BE killed my computer everytime.    so real question is, is this a game that may kill my craptop from overheating also"
JRPG,39iufe,TPsyko,2,Fri Jun 12 11:02:52 2015 UTC,What exactly are the specs of your laptop?
JRPG,39iufe,TPsyko,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:31:31 2015 UTC,"at work right now, but I think this one is pretty similar to mine  http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Satellite-A665-S6050-Laptop-i3-350M/dp/B0047Y94YS/ref=sr_1_16?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1434109911&sr=1-16&keywords=toshiba+satellite&refinements=p_n_operating_system_browse-bin%3A2232492011%2Cp_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A562240011"
JRPG,39iufe,TPsyko,2,Fri Jun 12 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"I am assuming that your laptop doesn't have an AMD/nVidia GPU and only runs on the on board graphics. Doing some light searches (currently studying for a quiz) with this assumption seems to say that it will run fine (720p ~40fps). But if your issue is overheating, I don't know whether it will bring out that much heat.  All that being said, Steam recently added refunds for game purchases. You should be able to get a refund for the game if it's not running well. However, make sure you read up on the refund policies to ensure an easy refund. I think the most important point is:   if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours."
JRPG,39iufe,TPsyko,2,Fri Jun 12 12:09:06 2015 UTC,"I was able to get a refund for BE, even though I got it during the winter sale. I think I will just buy the game and hope for the best.  thanks for the help."
JRPG,39iufe,Jamaz,2,Fri Jun 12 12:26:41 2015 UTC,All the best! You should message me the results as I am curious to see how the game performs on a system like that.   Happy gaming :)
JRPG,39iufe,Tickmeoff,2,Fri Jun 12 20:15:33 2015 UTC,Overall a great experience with the game so far. Alot more story and cutscences that I expected but i'm glad I got it.  And my laptop seems fine running it. Thanks for giving me the push to buy it.
JRPG,39iufe,gildedkitten,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:15:14 2015 UTC,Any news if Chronicles 2 or 3 are ever coming out on PC? I opted to get a 3DS besides a PSP :/
JRPG,39iufe,Fingonlfin,3,Fri Jun 12 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"Doubtful, 2 was garbage and 3 never made it out of Japan. There's a fan translation of 3 so you could just emulate both at this point."
JRPG,39iufe,Vorthas,3,Fri Jun 12 15:50:55 2015 UTC,"Used PSPs are hella cheap nowadays. You can get a refurbished one from Gamestop for $60. Add in an extra $20 for one of these and you're set.  If you're not too worried about the ethics of it, you can stick custom firmware on there and play UMD ISOs (such as the translation-patched VC3 ISO) from the memory stick as well as a number of emulators.  It'd generally be preferable if you bought the games through a legitimate channel so that the companies that made them actually get some revenue from them, but there aren't too many ways to buy new PSP games aside from digital distribution. And even then, there are quite a few PSP games that aren't available digitally."
JRPG,39iufe,G-0ff,3,Fri Jun 12 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"You could try emulating the game through ppsspp. From Youtube videos, it seems like it's completely playable.   Video of VC3 on ppsspp"
JRPG,39iufe,Cocopoofs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:19:14 2015 UTC,Do I need a super computer to run this emulator ? My crap PC struggles to run GC games...
JRPG,39iufe,Darelius,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:27:20 2015 UTC,"ppsspp is one of the faster emulators out there. this is evident in it being able to perform well on android devices too.  That said, it really still depends on the exact specs of your PC. You could give it a try as the emulator is free or search up people's performance with a similar PC configuration."
JRPG,39iufe,blasian123,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of more tactical/strategy RPGs (I prefer the more traditional turn-based RPGs like the early Final Fantasy games or Pokemon), but I may pick this game up.  75% off is a steal.  Only thing is, I dislike JRPGs like Fire Emblem and Agarest: Generations of War based solely on the gameplay, and I'm not sure how this game's gameplay is compared to them."
JRPG,39iufe,Tickmeoff,8,Fri Jun 12 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"It's less fire emblem, more xcom with shooter elements. Very heady, strategic gameplay with an infinitely more engaging and dynamic interface than your standard grid-based affair. I wrote a review of it at my old job. would have given it a perfect score but my dickhead boss decided we could only give those to triple-A titles that pay for ads (like Halo: The Master Chief Collection). It's one of the last generation's best games and well worth your time on PC."
JRPG,39iufe,Quikheat,2,Fri Jun 12 08:45:08 2015 UTC,"I have the same worries about the game myself. Can anyone shed some light on the mechanics and explain how it compares to FE, Disgaea and other srpgs?"
JRPG,39iufe,G-0ff,4,Fri Jun 12 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"I really love this game, the main differences i can think of is that, once you finish your turn it is of vital importance to set the direction right, the main classes, Scouts and Shocktroopers will atack anyone on sight outside of their turn as long as they see them, the second (sorry dont remember how is it called) particularties to each character, phobias, aptitudes, (allergies, fear of metal, nature lovers, lone wolfs, team workers and such) and who they like or dislike be it a person in particular or a group. Having them near someone they like ups some stats for them and makes them react, react faster if the friend near is being attacked and the enemy is on sight, while someone they hate can make them not help at all.  You have a base from where you can send back troops, call for other soldier (you have a deploy limit), and so does the enemy.  There are not many characters for the kind of game, so having a char die has more impact (altought is hard to get them killed).  Tough is shorter and in a sense easier than other tactical rpg, i think is easier to fuck up missions in this game."
JRPG,39iufe,ShureNensei,4,Fri Jun 12 04:38:48 2015 UTC,"It's similar to FE in that it's still a turn based strategy game where you move units around a map and take turns attacking and counterattacking. If that's your main grievance, it might not be your game. But I definitely think the 3D environment changes it up a bit from say FE or advanced wars. I also really liked the different ways you could fill out your squad, the special class abilities, usage of tanks, and the permadeath feature. However, like I said, it's still similar to FE, which I'm a big fan of. Fun characters and story too. The animation is gorgeous, with a stylized cel shaded look. Overall, I'd definitely recommend. Even if it's not your cup of tea, the sale puts it at a pretty reasonable price for a game that I personally enjoyed very much."
JRPG,39mloh,ReconTheExile,3,Fri Jun 12 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"Just requested to join, waiting for approval! I knew I would stumble upon an RPG club like this, I thought about why I've never seen one before and here it is he he."
JRPG,39mloh,Beats_ByRayRice,2,Sat Jun 13 03:25:31 2015 UTC,I think I've approved all the requests I've seen. Let me know if you still don't have access and I'll doublecheck the queue. Welcome to the Club!!!

JRPG,39kveo,7mad,4,Fri Jun 12 13:30:36 2015 UTC,You're already not playing it right now! How exciting!
JRPG,39kveo,makemeking706,4,Fri Jun 12 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"It looks like they're doing away with random battles and just having the enemies on the overworld like in DQ IX. I like the change, hopefully us westerners will actually get to play it."
JRPG,39kveo,CrimsonPig,3,Sat Jun 13 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"They're localizing this right?  If not, I might cry."
JRPG,39kveo,Nomanorus,2,Fri Jun 12 21:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well they didn't localize the DQ7 remake or DQX, so well see but i wouldn't get my hopes up. SE just likes to tease it's fans with stuff they never get, especally us westerners."
JRPG,39kveo,pantsyman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:47:09 2015 UTC,"I had to go back and look at the original to see if I was misremembering, but I'm not, it looks like the game has been splattered with neon paint. This seriously hurts my eyes. I am guessing they added a huge amount of unnecessary bloom just like Nintendo did with the wind waker hd release.  I cant believe that the day would come when I would actually want HD releases of ps2 games on modern consoles, but here we are."
JRPG,39kveo,postwar-snowman,2,Fri Jun 12 22:36:11 2015 UTC,You don't know what bloom is.  The visuals are highly saturated most likely to fit the 3DS small LED screen.
JRPG,39kveo,xRichard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"I said I was guessing, and regardless of what they have actually done to it I think it looks awful."
JRPG,39kjlk,flappjackson,5,Fri Jun 12 11:02:22 2015 UTC,"Replaying Earthbound. I first played it about 6-7 years ago. It's not as good as I remember. I remember loving the novelty of baseball bats and UFOs, but this time the story seems thin, the humor is kinda meh, and all I need to do in every fight is bash, bash, bash. The item system also drives me crazy. I'm always at capacity, and it takes way too long to move items around or call the item storage service. Ness needs a cell phone."
JRPG,39kjlk,crabtreason,3,Fri Jun 12 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"I'm replaying Earthbound also! I beat it about 10 years ago when I hooked up my PC to an old tube TV, although I did use some emulator help. Right now I'm replaying it on PC in 1440p (looks good lol) b/c I can't properly play Mother 1 or 3 on my old DS anyways, and also those games are quite different in their own ways (I've barely played them though)  To me it's better than I remember. The world is rich and beautiful, things are hilarious, and the game is relaxing and engaging. The inventory system is a little obtuse but to me it is still a pleasure to manage. Items need to be used or sold, it's something to be aware of and to plan for. There's a lot more to the story, themes and characters than what's on the surface in my opinion and it's just amazing to explore the world. It feels artfully designed rather than mechanically constructed. Sometimes I see people who are nonplussed by the game's reputed humour, and I don't get it; the writing alone is consistently laugh-out-loud funny. The gameplay is time-tested and solid, but sometimes the experience does seem to move at an escargot's pace. Everything is so interesting/enjoyable that I don't mind though."
JRPG,39kjlk,Wendicome_Wendigo,4,Sat Jun 13 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"Started Ys: Felghana the other day. I wasn't expecting a sprite/poly mix game to have real-time combat this smooth, for some reason.  Also, Splatoon. Best multiplayer shooter I've played in YEARS---the gameplay is accessible without being insulting, the match length and respawn time are just short enough that you're never down-and-out for long (Insurgency, ARMA, and Counterstrike had so much waaaaiting), the arena size likewise adds to the fast pace, and the aesthetic is adorable.  Also, DooM. I love DooM. So many mods for such an old game.  Played the card game Danmaku!! on Tabletop Simulator with some folk, and played Don't Starve Together with a real-life best bud. I think as a survival-game Don't Starve Together is better out of the box than Minecraft---Minecraft's a good LEGO block simulator but I find it too slow and boring to get into as a game, whereas with Don't Starve Together I always had the recipes I needed but still always felt major urgency to survive. Also, I like Don't Starves' bestiary more---lots of different critters and they all had a different role, like a miniature ecosystem."
JRPG,39kjlk,alleycw,2,Fri Jun 12 12:01:36 2015 UTC,"After many many years of putting it off, I'm finally completing my play through of Persona 4. I've probably started this game 5 or 6 times on PS2 and PS Vita, but this time I am going to complete it. It's such a fantastic game, the story and the characters make it hard to put down. But to be honest I'm somewhat ready to be down with it. Not because it's bad, but because it's a very dense, long game.  Next I'm going to make my way through all three Parasite Eve games."
JRPG,39kjlk,Rinne-chan,3,Fri Jun 12 13:12:06 2015 UTC,"On Thursday, I finally finished The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky for the PC, and then I beat the first Ys game on Friday (also PC). While I did enjoy the LoH, the story didn't really come alive for me till about 15-20 hours into the game (at about the end of Chpt 3). Once it got going though, it made me excited to see what happens next. I'm especially ecstatic for SC this summer.  The first Ys game was good as well. I actually didn't mind the bump-system all that much tbh. I'm happy they changed that in other releases of the game though. The only thing that made the game bad was that it was too short. I beat it in about 6 hours. I assume it's short because it was used to as ""world building"" for the second game.  Anyways, I started playing Ys: II today. I'm hoping to buy the rest of the Ys games that are on PC sometime during the summer sale."
JRPG,39kjlk,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Sat Jun 13 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"As someone who recently also finished the game I'd love for you to have a read of my trails in the sky review, posted it here about 2-3 weeks ago, should be easy to find if you do a search via the subs search bar.

JRPG,39kjlk,DaleLeatherwood,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"I have been going through the FF's that I never beat (usually played to the last boss).  I finished IX and X and I am working through VIII.  I like so much about it, but the game-breaking stat system and the inability to use magic or level without penalties is a real downer towards my enjoyment of the game.  Then Splatoon came and I remember what it was like to have fun playing a video game.  Now I am debating whether to go back to FFVIII or to wait until e3 to get a release for Xenoblade Chronicles X."
JRPG,39kjlk,CinnaTheUgly,2,Fri Jun 12 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"The thing with the leveling system is that it gets so over hyped.  I finished the game 2 weeks ago, and in the the end of disc three, early disc four my characters went up 20 or 30 levels. As long as you understand how to junction properly(not necessary to break the system) and don't try to grind early so that you don't have access to the better magics, and your battling heavy monsters early you are fine. Its just something that I feel is over dramatized and it turns people away."
JRPG,39kjlk,DaleLeatherwood,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:14:00 2015 UTC,"I really never paid attention to the leveling, really it is the inability to use magic that frustrates me.  That being said, it is a little annoying to know that leveling does not ""absolutely"" make you stronger than your opponents.  I can understand why this might irk other people, though."
JRPG,39kjlk,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm not worried about my ability to win in the battle. I've just always loved the feeling of getting more powerful in leveling up (that's all games, not just JRPG's).  I'll give it another shot one day, and you'll all hear from me!"
JRPG,39kjlk,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"Your feelings on VIII are exactly why I played FFVII straight to FFIX. It's also weird to me that leveling up actually hinders you. Anyway, people are saying to give it another shot so I will be eventually if not just to see the story."
JRPG,39kjlk,DaleLeatherwood,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"So I think that FFVIII has so much potential that it is worth a second look, but it is kind of weird to have 4k hp at level 14 because you played a few rounds of a card game.  I really miss FFVII's system, which I still consider the best in the series.  I wish they could have found a way to combine the two.  In fact, I have thought about trying to mod FFVIII so that there is no magic quantity; you either have the spell or you don't.  If you get the spell, you have it forever unless you refine it to a higher level spell or get rid of it to make space.  It would also save time because you would only need to draw a spell once per character.  Drawing again and again is just needless grinding."
JRPG,39kjlk,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:50:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I also don't want to have to turn enemies in to cards every time I fight them.   If you found a way to do that without breaking the Junction system, that could work out really well."
JRPG,39kjlk,DaleLeatherwood,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"I think the junction system is kind of broken as is... I mean, if you encounter an enemy with a new spell that you really want, you can get the same result by just wasting 20 minutes having everyone draw until they hit 100.  And if you are determined to max stats, you will.  So why not just give them the junction and have every magic junction as if the player had 100 of them?"
JRPG,39kjlk,themadridi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"I started playing SMTIV again on the 3ds. I played it the first time when it was released, it was my first SMT game, I enjoyed it, but thought it was too long and hard, and I didn't know where I had to go anymore.   Having played the 2 Devil Survivor games recently and enjoying them, (haven't beaten them yet), I decided to give SMTIV another chance now that I am more familiar with the game mechanics and stats."
JRPG,39kjlk,radiosilents,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'm playing through Rogue Galaxy for the first time and I'm kind of torn. It feels like it SHOULD be fun and interesting but it seems to have the fatal balance flaws so common in Level5 games.   In the same way that Dark Cloud 2 underutilizes some of the should-be-fun aspects (monster transformations, for example), Rogue Galaxy gives me all sorts of wonderful weapon development yet it's far easier to pop off one spell soon as combat begins and end the whole encounter. Combat itself isn't compelling enough to make me WANT to spend the time discovering weapons as it all still plays out the same way regardless (even when you ignore your spells and swing your fancy sword instead - no subtlety, just whap whap whap until they die, with maybe a brief interlude to break a shield).   The plot is child/mentor or lost-love heavy (which is fine but not terribly engaging) but the characters are pretty thin and predictable. The ""no load time"" claim is achieved simply by having sprawling hallways to hide the loading, leading to meandering dungeons that take ages to walk through. luckily, the liberal spread of teleporters helps but since the main allure of walking (random encounters) are also bland i usually just camp a teleporter to grind and then jump to wherever i want to be next.   the hidden boss fights are a fun diversion, but Shadow of the Colossus this is not.   it's a beautiful game and i love the setting but i'm just not being grabbed by the fundamentals yet. I'm on Chapter 7 and considering putting it down."
JRPG,39kjlk,vinvo7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Working on two right now.   Final Fantasy X HD for the PS4 (Thousandth Playthrough): Currently trying to fill out the sphere grid and farm stat spheres. I want to get all the trophies but it's such a pain in the ass. Especially with the problems that can arise from the PS4 version's fixed RNG. Even though I've played this game a lot, this is my first time with the International Version, so the dark aeons and Penance should be interesting.   Xenoblade Chronicles (First Playthrough): I've been playing this one on and off. I'm about 15 hours in and it definitely gives me a feeling reminiscent to Final Fantasy XII. Aka, a game of questing with a story thrown in. This is for sure an adventurer's game. The fast travel, the moving time, HP regenerating between battles, armor is dropped everywhere, NPC relationships, the collectopedia -- everything is meant to encourage the player to quest and collect. The battle system hasn't gotten too interesting for me yet as every monster I face either dies in seconds or is about 70 levels ahead of me and will kill me instantaneously. I'm hoping the battles gain more depth soon."

JRPG,39kjlk,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:52:51 2015 UTC,"Half way through tales of eternia so far. In celestial honestly... I don't like it at all. Combats clunky, encounters we annoying, characters other that farah and keel are just boring.  And the dungeons are... They're all just annoying mazes, I'm fine with mazes but it's just repeating rooms most of the time.  On ps1 it might be great for it's time, on psp in 2015 it doesn't really step up. Even the soundtrack is forgettable. I'd heard good things about this game too.  Can anyone please try to sell me on how much better it gets?"
JRPG,39kjlk,LeaveScars,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Playing through two:   Secret of Mana: I've been replaying it to try and complete it; first time I got to the Mana Beast and never finished it. The game's pretty good. Love the battle system, but the completionist in me has me leveling the weapons as far as they can go, rather than enjoying the games. Some enemies are really annoying. The menus are clunky to the point that it's taken me two playthroughs to understand how to access a specific character's menu. Fine-ish so far, but... Terranigma: Illusion of Gaia got me interested in playing the rest of the Soul Blazer series, and now I'm onto this. The game really blurs the lines between action-adventure and action RPG so much it's not even funny. Game's a lot of fun, combat is engaging for how simple it is. It reminds me of LoZ: A Link to the Past with mentions of Light Worlds and Dark Worlds is very interesting. I like how the two seem to be sentient beings. We'll see where the game goes!"

JRPG,39gqx5,requisite_monocle,3,Thu Jun 11 21:31:41 2015 UTC,that way I can get them as confused as ASAP Rocky albums   Truer words have never been spoken
JRPG,39gqx5,phatboisteez,2,Thu Jun 11 21:39:02 2015 UTC,Sounds like the Legend of Legendary Heroes

JRPG,39gqx5,YoureASquidNow,5,Thu Jun 11 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting, I only got so far in the Japanese release, its all just quests, quests and quests, dungeons and dungeons though, the game contains a grand total of 1 town which you regularly return to.  I was quite saddened by this as I'd thought it to be a more stereotypical JRPG. Its fun, its one hell of a grindfest though, worth trying if you're a SaGa fan though."
JRPG,39gqx5,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm still playing it, I'm sure many people will not enjoy it and others will love it since there is no story at all almost. I got confused with the elemental spirit thingie since they don't explain very well but after getting the hang of how to level up/learn new skills I found it very enjoying."
JRPG,39gqx5,zuvi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah very little was every said about it having little plot outside of treasure hunting and stuff. I went in expecting something akin to Bravely Default, didn't dislike what I got but wasn't expecting it.  I wasn't able to read all the dialogue though, I got maybe 60% of it at most."
JRPG,39gqx5,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:48:25 2015 UTC,Japanese is my native language so I didn't have the same problem but still they didn't explain much. It would have been a little better if I didn't have to use a guide to understand all the mechanic though lol
JRPG,39gqx5,zuvi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:31:36 2015 UTC,would you describe it as similar to etrian odyssey? in terms of difficulty and gameplay depth

JRPG,39gqx5,CrispyPixel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"So apparently this is based on SaGa? What is it about it that's similar? I never played (Or hardly heard about, I think) that series."
JRPG,39gqx5,vazzaroth,2,Fri Jun 12 07:57:16 2015 UTC,"I've only read about it so take this with a grain of salt. It seems SaGa is best known for being completely open world from the very beginning, being able to choose between a number of characters which you want to play, and a nonstandard leveling system where you improve skills by using them not a general level up."
JRPG,39gqx5,FroDude258,2,Sat Jun 13 14:21:22 2015 UTC,Well shit that sounds amazing. I'll have to watch this game and check out the older ones.
JRPG,39iy7d,TreeHandThingy,4,Fri Jun 12 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"Just gotta say. Grandia is one of my first JRPG loves. Everything about it is amazing, however I am going to tell you this its a grind fest. If you don't grind the skills of the characters there's a few bosses that will mercilessly dominate you."
JRPG,39iy7d,knightstorm,2,Fri Jun 12 01:24:58 2015 UTC,I actually didn't like Grandia. The story was... bleh. I prefer the 2nd game over the first one.
JRPG,39iy7d,Terran_Too_Stronk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:16:46 2015 UTC,Each to their own. I found it really engaging there were bits where it dragged. Though I can say that about pretty much every JRPG I've played.  The second one though I have to admit does punch you right in the feels at a certain point. I'm not to proud to admit it made me blub.
JRPG,39iy7d,knightstorm,2,Fri Jun 12 15:57:04 2015 UTC,Everything about it is amazing   That voice acting though.
JRPG,39iy7d,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:08:30 2015 UTC,"For it's time lucky to have voice acting at all really. Its been so long that I have played it, that I will admit the waves of nostalgia will have tinted my judgement. Though ""Justin, you pervert!"" Is still on my all time highs of gaming comedy moments.  As for standard of voice acting in games I've encountered some poor quality stuff. Destiny is flat for me, but I hate that game and everything it stands for. FFX was pretty awful for me aswell.   I'll admit not looked through your list fully but a great game as well is Rogue Galaxy for PS2. You can easily get 20hours if you just do the story line 100hours if you are like me and like to complete everything. Voice acting is a bit hit and miss though."
JRPG,39iy7d,knightstorm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"Oh certainly its the first voice acted JRPG I can even think of.  The comedy dialogue doesn't bother me, its more the tense moments ruined by lines that seem confused by.  I've not played Destiny, and FFX, I didn't think it was great but it was okei in parts, depends on the character.  My list? I didn't write a list, you might be confusing me with OP.  Rogue Galaxy huh, will give it a google then."
JRPG,39iy7d,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I remember it being quite well done in some places. But I don't want to leave spoilers.  Tidus and Seymour's voice acting was the worse. Seymours character was like the bastard love child of sephiroth and kuja.  And yes my bad. But yes Rogue Galaxy. Good game, has a new game plus mode aswell"
JRPG,39iy7d,knightstorm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"I do like that I can at least see my progress towards unlocking new spells, even if I don't know which ones are coming. It makes it more rewarding to know there are goals in the grinding beyond simple leveling up."
JRPG,39iy7d,knightstorm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"I do like that I can at least see my progress towards unlocking new spells, even if I don't know which ones are coming. It makes it more rewarding to know there are goals in the grinding beyond simple leveling up.   It certainly makes things more worthwhile. Its just a cracking game all over, its a game where I want a remake but only if it was graphics and they kept everything else the same."
JRPG,39iy7d,NakedScotsman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"You don't need to grind really, the game's pretty easy considering how overpowered justin is. I love the game but if you are struggling you can just spam one of his aoe moves later on to get 3 forms of experience each use."
JRPG,39iy7d,Purest_Prodigy,3,Fri Jun 12 19:56:03 2015 UTC,What'd you think of Wild Arms? Did you manage to do the sidequests? They're really great for wrapping up loose ends...
JRPG,39iy7d,TearzOP,2,Fri Jun 12 05:10:22 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it more as it went along. I've been avoiding sidequests in an effort to get through more games, so I didn't really get a chance to get more involved.  I will say that, despite its reputation, I never really felt like it was a ""Western"" RPG. It seemed very traditional, aside from a few character outfits and an occasional soundtrack. There was too much compromise with the western with traditional dragons and castles, etc. to really get immersed in it.  With that said, the part of the story where Rudy is injured really got to me. The end was magnificent as well."
JRPG,39iy7d,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Fri Jun 12 06:51:23 2015 UTC,"From my experience, the western theme is a LOT more pronounced in Wild Arms 2 and 3."
JRPG,39iy7d,Dan_Tsukasa,3,Fri Jun 12 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"From my experience playing multiple JRPGS at the same time is the worst possible idea, it just gets messy, you end up not finishing anything or getting far it anything because you're so unsure where to go or what to do, or the story, or how the system works when you finally get around to going back to it.  I'd say for a better experience do 1 at a time."
JRPG,39iy7d,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:09:47 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been doing. I originally tried to just jump around (which is why there is minimal progress on so many of them), before I realized I wasn't going to enjoy a single one. The list orders the games in order I plan to play through them. I usually take a week or so break in between games to not burn out, as well."
JRPG,39iy7d,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"A week or so break sounds like a long time, I'd probably screw up a little in that time, though, it did take me like 2 months to finish Popolocrois and Trails in the Sky come to think of it.  I've jumped around a few games on my vita... means they're all unfinished."
JRPG,39iy7d,SuperShmamBro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"I have to agree here. I feel like part of the wonder of these games is getting sucked in to the world, gameplay, characters, etc. Playing multiple at once makes that hard to me. Maybe that's just me though.  For example, if this, @OP, is your first time playing Chrono Trigger, pleeeeease just focus on that individually."
JRPG,39iy7d,Sulvian,2,Fri Jun 12 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"What'd you think of Dark Cloud? That game is one of my favorite games of all time, if only for the weapon system.  Also, why no Dark Cloud 2 on the list then?"
JRPG,39iy7d,merph_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"Dark Cloud was such a mixed bag. I enjoyed the weapon upgrade system, and there were so many elements that forced you to carefully plan each move. It's difficulty was a welcome breath of fresh air. I greatly enjoyed the georama parts, as well, and liked watching all the character's stories unfold after completing the town building.  However, overall, battles felt wonky. The controls were rather loose, and this made maneuvering during boss fights hellish. The first phase of the final boss fight was the worst boss fight in any RPG I've ever played. Whoever the hell decided that pausing your game every ten seconds to switch your attributes in a fight that simultaneously requires reflexes and dodging should be fired from gaming forever. I hated that fight with a passion.  Overall: 3/5. No Dark Cloud 2 because I don't own it."
JRPG,39iy7d,amp3rsand,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in terms of the final boss...I remember it was simply awful. Plus if you hadn't been upgrading weapons for Ruby, it made the fight ridiculously harder. You could pull off using Osmond too though.  You should look in to getting a copy of Dark Cloud 2 if you can. It improves a lot in terms of combat, but it still has the great georama and upgrade system."
JRPG,39fnix,7mad,2,Thu Jun 11 12:08:06 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that's something like a Persona Magazine exists.

JRPG,39fnix,Murkury,5,Fri Jun 12 01:11:11 2015 UTC,Not sure if you're serious.  But Nanako is on the cover because she plays a role in Persona 4 Dancing All Night.
