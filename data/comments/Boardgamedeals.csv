Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,DreaminOfBananas,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"Just got a Ding & Dent one of this for around the same price last week...if you like Carcassonne, I think it's worth it! Though, it is quite a big box (probably 2.5x the size of the standard carcassone box)"
Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,italianstal1ion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:05 2015 UTC,Bought mine on coolstuff for 51.99
Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,dankfloyd,2,Tue Jul 21 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"I actually got mine from CSI, too, but this is the cheapest I've seen it at Amazon and they do have faster free shipping with no minimum."
Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,dankfloyd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:13 2015 UTC,That is true. I always forget about the $100 free shipping thing because I usually buy more than $100 worth.
Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,jonlubbe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:53:16 2015 UTC,"Paid 59.99 for it back in Feb.  Great box.   Which expansions are not included in this box,  and are they worth picking up?"
Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,italianstal1ion,3,Tue Jul 21 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"You can see an old poll here (click on ""Results"" under the questions): https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/42910/complete-carcassonne-poll  ""Abbey and Mayor"" is considered pretty good, and ""Princess and the Dragon"" is well-liked, though somewhat polarizing."
Boardgamedeals,3e3lss,bookchaser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:29 2015 UTC,"Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders are the must-have expansions, and they make a complete game. Beyond that, you have to ask yourself how many expansions you want to chase after, how many additional rules you can add (and how much longer you want to expand a game time-wise), before the fun you found in the original base game is gone."
Boardgamedeals,3e42ty,italianstal1ion,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"Discount Price of $11.99, with discount code of 20% off is $9.60!  Code: ENCORE-ENCORE-ENCORE  Cheapest its been since it launched out of Early Access"
Boardgamedeals,3e42ty,Squ4d13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"Nice, the second one worked ;)"
Boardgamedeals,3e42ty,AlexanderTheStraight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:09:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! I just bought it. What are some good games to start with?
Boardgamedeals,3e1gsz,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:50:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure how long this has been on the market, but it seems to be popping up on clearance. At least two local stores had it for half-off."
Boardgamedeals,3e1b6a,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:04 2015 UTC,Promo code Az13 takes off $5 from orders over $75. Stacks with free shipping for orders over $100.
Boardgamedeals,3dzpkh,deux11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:07 2015 UTC,BGG  MM - $40.19  CSI - $39.99  Mostly for those of us who didn't join the Mass Drop deal because we already have Trains.
Boardgamedeals,3dzpkh,iroll20s,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:39 2015 UTC,The original trains is only $29 if you missed it as well http://www.amazon.com/Alderac-Entertainment-Group-5801AEG-Trains/dp/B00E3FHVQE/ref=pd_sbs_21_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=03CY2N4D9DW2Z94C3QK4

Boardgamedeals,3dtjcu,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:50:51 2015 UTC,Definitely a good deal. I think I paid three times as much to Kickstart it.  The game is pretty fun. Biggest complaints are that the black and blue cardboard bits are nearly indistinguishable and the rulebook is horrible. But someone on bgg has posted clarifications and sample turns that make it possible to play.
Boardgamedeals,3dtjcu,tripswithtiresias,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:22:57 2015 UTC,I picked this up recently for about that price. It's actually a really well designed semi-coop. I really recommend it!
Boardgamedeals,3dtjcu,philequal,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:   [/r/boardgames] [x-post /r/boardgamedeals] Kill Shakespeare for $15 + $6.99 shipping. Worth checking out!

Boardgamedeals,3dqnrt,SPprime,5,Sat Jul 18 14:52:25 2015 UTC,Get it. Worth every single penny and its small enough that you can keep it in the car all the time
Boardgamedeals,3dqnrt,DoTheDinosaur,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:46 2015 UTC,It's currently $10.39 on Amazon for anyone who doesn't have a Target close by.
Boardgamedeals,3dqnrt,myboatfloats,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:49:08 2015 UTC,Picked up two.
Boardgamedeals,3dqnrt,Rabbyk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:00 2015 UTC,The Target near me never has any clearance deals that show up on reddit.  Makes me sad.
Boardgamedeals,3dqnrt,jumpyg1258,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"Mine rarely does, this was really unusual for me to see"
Boardgamedeals,3dqnrt,AutomatedApathy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:06:20 2015 UTC,Sadly none at my store.
Boardgamedeals,3dr6vi,BGG_DEALS_BOT,3,Sat Jul 18 17:50:58 2015 UTC,Mine had Munchkin on clearance for $12.  If there is a target in your area you should stop by and look.  Different stores having different clearance items.
Boardgamedeals,3dr6vi,dar24601,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"Mine didn't have sushi go :( it did have adventure time munchkin, munchkin legends, catch phrase, and a couple other ones that have been submitted here lately."
Boardgamedeals,3dr6vi,Twas_Inevitable,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"Mine had cartoon network fluxx, zombie dice, and sushi go."
Boardgamedeals,3dr6vi,travisty913,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:30:50 2015 UTC,"Mine had nothing! I used to shop here probably twice a month just for clearance, now I don't think they mark down anything anymore."
Boardgamedeals,3dr6vi,Lucasisbored,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:51 2015 UTC,Mine has Zombie Dice on clearance and Sushi Go in stock but not on clearance.
Boardgamedeals,3dr6vi,Skarvha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:39 2015 UTC,Everything was full price here in Los Angeles (Sherman Oaks specifically)
Boardgamedeals,3do9fj,Twas_Inevitable,5,Fri Jul 17 22:02:27 2015 UTC,I said the only copy of munchkin I would own would be this one... saw it at Target on clearance and now it's mine.
Boardgamedeals,3do9fj,threefingersplease,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"I own several of the different versions,  can confirm this is the best one."
Boardgamedeals,3do9fj,L_Monochromicorn,3,Sat Jul 18 01:08:14 2015 UTC,They are selling king of Tokyo for $27 and sushi go for $5 too if you can find it. I found both on their game wall behind the toys. Also got 2 different sets of story cubes for $4 each.
Boardgamedeals,3do9fj,EctoPrime,2,Sat Jul 18 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"I'll probably try my Target, but can you say which Target you got that at?  Edit: no go at the San Jose Capitol store in San Jose, California. However, they did have a small selection of other board games on clearance. Might be worth stopping by if it's no trouble."
Boardgamedeals,3do9fj,Deegrin,2,Sat Jul 18 00:24:54 2015 UTC,"Lucky, I picked up my copy a few days ago on target clearance for 15 bucks. It wasn't a great deal but I justified it because it was the only one left in stock."
Boardgamedeals,3dlaw1,BGG_DEALS_BOT,0,Fri Jul 17 04:50:44 2015 UTC,Just bought this from them last week for $27...  :/
Boardgamedeals,3dlaw1,fif89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:17 2015 UTC,I Just bought this Yesterday for $27 :(  Never fails.
Boardgamedeals,3djyym,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"It might be only my local store, but I picked up Sons of Anarchy at Books-a-Million for ~$22. It was 50% off with an another 10% off from my rewards club thing."
Boardgamedeals,3djyym,villanx1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:37:20 2015 UTC,none of the targets in my area have firefly or sons of anarchy!!!!!!!!! its killing me. i need both :(
Boardgamedeals,3djilz,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Dang, 12$ shipping to California. I guess it's still below MSRP, but I was hoping to drop only about $20 D:"
Boardgamedeals,3dj1y3,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:47 2015 UTC,$14 shipping??? Never mind.  Thats over half the price of the game alone.
Boardgamedeals,3dj1y3,Homelesswarrior,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:04 2015 UTC,The key to ordering from BGW is to order $100 worth of games at once for free shipping...
Boardgamedeals,3di6ac,BGG_DEALS_BOT,2,Thu Jul 16 13:50:45 2015 UTC,;)
Boardgamedeals,3dgyx2,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"The minor downside is that if you don't spend $100 for the free shipping, it's $7.74 if you have to pay for shipping and don't do in-store pickup."
Boardgamedeals,3dhu8a,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:50:49 2015 UTC,I dont see any. I could just be blind
Boardgamedeals,3dejjj,captaintobs,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:20 2015 UTC,$50 Imperial Assault. Amazing!
Boardgamedeals,3dejjj,GreenArrow76,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's bonkers, I thought snagging it for $58 on cardhaus during May the 4th would be the cheapest I'd ever see it."
Boardgamedeals,3dejjj,tydelwav,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"I saw Star Wars and got excited, a bit bummed the Armada core set wasn't on sale or I would have snatched it up in a heartbeat."
Boardgamedeals,3demb3,BGG_DEALS_BOT,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:13 2015 UTC,Is this a good game?  Can 3 people play?
Boardgamedeals,3demb3,cobaltblues77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:06 2015 UTC,...and it's out of stock....
Boardgamedeals,3demby,BGG_DEALS_BOT,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:23 2015 UTC,Gahhh wish I could get imperial assault
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,BGG_DEALS_BOT,9,Wed Jul 15 06:50:37 2015 UTC,"Prime is only doing lightning deals on games, which makes this a waste of time for me. Stuff is sold out within the first minute. And, the selection of games is tiny, and disappointing. They've had much better sales before, not even on Black Friday.  Hopefully Wal-Mart has a better supply for the games it sells today."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,bookchaser,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:07:38 2015 UTC,Don't forget the Gift Card Bundle deal on Amazon. It can essentially be a free $10 for every $45 in gift cards. Stack that savings onto an already good price boardgame and you can get some pretty good deals.
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"Limit one per prime account, but yes it is still a good deal. Only thing I bit on today."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,Antagonist37,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:16 2015 UTC,Where does it say one per prime account? Currently they are all sold out so I'm dealing with customer support to try to gain access.
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:52:43 2015 UTC,On the page that listed all the gift card bundle options there was a button to activate your coupon. Above that there was a link with the specifics and disclaimers for the promotion. That is how I found out it was redeemed via e-mail and there was a limit 1 per account. I couldn't find the page again since they have sold out.
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,Antagonist37,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it will make a difference to everyone, but I still received the $10 credit despite them being sold out. I contacted chat support and asked for options to receive it. I offered to buy 3 individual $15 gift cards or a single $45 gift card. They gave me the credit with no purchase necessary. I do spend a fair amount on Amazon though, so I'm uncertain the requirements to receive this."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"They're back in stock now, starting at $75."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,bookchaser,0,Wed Jul 15 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"The $75 isn't nearly as good of a deal though. If you talk to them, they might work with you. They did for me."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"It is the only advertised deal, $10 credit with purchase of any gift card pack."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,bookchaser,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Any gift card pack includes the sold out $45 variety. If you want to buy the $75 variety, I'm not saying don't. I'm just saying they might work with you if you talk to them through chat support."
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,WeylandTheDwarf,6,Wed Jul 15 17:29:37 2015 UTC,The fact that Monopoly makes this list speaks volumes.
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,flaginplay,3,Wed Jul 15 16:24:27 2015 UTC,Miniature market is doing a MUCH better sale!
Boardgamedeals,3dcs9b,MrCaptainFlash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:42:49 2015 UTC,Literally nothing worth my spit going on sale today.
