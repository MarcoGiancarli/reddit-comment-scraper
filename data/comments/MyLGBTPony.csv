Bisexual people are affected by this ruling too. There are (slightly) more bisexualpeople than there are gay and lesbian people in the US,but they are constantly forgotten and ignored and erased. Bisexual health outcomes, abuse outcomes and suicides are all worse than for LGs, and constant erasure contributes to that.  I don't expect the mainstream press to get it, but here in our little queer haven, let me have this victory too. I am not gay, but I am queer and this ruling is for me, too.

The more time you spend being you and being comfortable the less weird it will feel because it will become the new normal in your world. Don't worry about it feeling a bit weird right now. Being queer isn't a weird thing but being queer in a straight world sure can feel it."

You definitely shouldn't feel ""weird,"" or at least you shouldn't feel bad about perhaps being ""weird,"" I think that just about everyone is ""weird"" in some way or another, and honestly, truly ""normal"" people are pretty lame, all things considered. It's always tough to challenge gender/sexuality norms that you've grown accustomed to, especially if you don't start coming to those realizations (fairly) late. Know that that feeling will take a while to go away, but eventually, it really will, especially as you find other people who are loving and accepting of who you are and how you want to express yourself."

I went through all 4 years of undergrad largely in the closet as to being bi, a lot of times I would get those same comments because I had a beard, masculine interests (sports namely) and mostly dude-bro type friends (not too many other options where I went), the comments really do hurt, especially because people just aren't aware of how it hits you. I'm just starting to be semi-open at age 24, and that's despite living in a very liberal city (Portland), and having pretty cool friends and family. Like other people in the thread have said, just do you, and feel great doing it, if you feel up to it, consider telling your roommate, or at least telling him to lay off about looks, but know that even if you don't, he's just one person, there will be many more in life who won't give you any crap for whatever you wear. Best of luck!!! And thanks for posting here in /r/mylgbtpony, we should get more action here! Not enough queer bronies in my opinion."

But, I have been feeling more and more confident with what I wear, despite my roommate's attitude.   I'm surprised that people haven't been posting here. In my experience, a number of the bronies I've met fall under the lgbt spectrum. But, I'll see what I can do to liven this place up a bit!"
MyLGBTPony,32vui8,Relictorum,2,Fri Apr 17 22:24:52 2015 UTC,"Any time! And perhaps post again down the line as to how things are going. I think people have posted less just because in general, auxillary MLP subreddits have declined overall in activity, people tend not to post if they think people won't see it. I noticed in your other reply you mentioned a burgeoning enjoyment of knee socks. That was the first thing I started to wear queer (ish) expression wise, right after I discovered MLP. Now, at my new University where I'm doing grad work I've actually become known as knee-sock guy, as I wear them with shorts every day, they are my favorite way to express ""cute-ness"" without coming off as explicitly queer. If you want a great place to buy them, sockdreams.com has them for $6 a pair, free shipping, and their cheap ones fit my huge dude-calfs great (a problem I have found with women's knee socks)."
MyLGBTPony,32vui8,Relictorum,2,Fri Apr 17 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"I just ordered a pair of arm warmers from sockdreams.com! I saw a bunch of cute socks there, too.   I actually just got a couple new pairs of socks today! I felt a bit more confident after all of the support and kind words you guys had given me."
MyLGBTPony,32vui8,Relictorum,2,Fri Apr 17 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"Dude just wear what you want, and that top looks damn good on you."
MyLGBTPony,32vui8,Relictorum,2,Fri Apr 17 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks!  I've been trying to wear more and more of what I want to wear, even though it might also be a bit queer. Mainly just more flowy tank tops, cute knee socks, and arm warmers. But again, I'm more of a masculine guy, so even though I have some of those I have to just wear them privately more often.

Jeez this is super well-written, and a lot of freaky junk has gone down. One bit--you all know what I'm talking about--made me massively uncomfortable, as it was supposed to. I loved it for that reason. As for this bit, I personally have always subscribed to the interpretation that Dash identifies as straight, but is a little bit not, and has bi-curious tendencies. So yeah, I actually really like where this is going."

For them it's this weird thing that came out of nowhere, and they're still wondering if your trolling them or somehow got abducted by gayliens. Straight people sometimes don't get that you don't decide your sexuality, you find out your sexuality. I thought my brain was playing tricks on me for the longest time.

I've kinda always known I liked boys, and later in life I learned there was a word for it. Gay. But after seeing all the negative emotions that brought up in my elders, I thought it best not to say anything. Until one day I maned up and decided that I was ready for it and that I was going to show my dad that he couldn't just make me into him.   I was wrong, I wasn't ready for what he gave me. It still hurts.  We've talked once or twice, but only for a couple minutes when I call my grandparents and he's there. It's like two acquaintances making conversation in passing. He doesn't care, he just makes small talk until he's done and hands the phone off. I ask him why he doesn't talk to me the same way he used to, and he just says he has to go.   It just...it sucks.  But thanks man. Thanks you so much. <3"

MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,blueberryjamoutlaw,6,Tue Jan 21 07:47:40 2014 UTC,"I think the first thing I did when I integrated college was to rub in the face of everyone that I'm a pansexual brony who practises BDSM. That way, everyone clearly knows that I'm a weird person, and surprisingly enought I made a lot of cool friends.  The faces I saw were priceless though xD  I'm in pretty good terms with every one I came out to (safe a few jerks I respectfully dismissed)"
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,emmafree,4,Tue Jan 21 12:43:45 2014 UTC,Congratulations! I'm out to everyone except certain family. I'm taking that bullet when I grow out of safety nets (or when I start dating a dude that can't pass for straight).
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,Voiddreamer,4,Tue Jan 21 13:21:37 2014 UTC,I'm now officially out as trans* to all my friends and my parents! Not at work though- that can wait til I'm ready to go full-time.
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,Voiddreamer,5,Tue Jan 21 15:39:53 2014 UTC,Can I be new and insensitive for a moment? What does the asterisk on trans mean?
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,Gayburn_Wright,4,Tue Jan 21 16:22:36 2014 UTC,"It basically turns it into an umbrella term for anyone who identifies as trans, not just FtMs and MtFs."
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,emmafree,4,Tue Jan 21 18:15:02 2014 UTC,"Ah. I thought trans was pre-op, and trans was post-op. Sorry for being so small-minded."
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,Froey,4,Wed Jan 22 02:54:39 2014 UTC,"This stuff isn't exactly broadcasted on TV, it's not being rude or small minded if you don't know about it."
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,lil_buddha,3,Wed Jan 22 03:00:13 2014 UTC,"Thanks; I just feel like since I'm part of the LGBT community, I have a responsibility to know more than the average person."
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,lil_buddha,2,Wed Jan 22 09:52:56 2014 UTC,"Huh. That actually kinda irritated me. I know that asterisks are commonly used like that for that but seeing it used everywhere with no like, extra bit of information attached was ever so slightly upsetting.  Good to know it's being used properly!"
MyLGBTPony,1vqw6x,lil_buddha,5,Wed Jan 29 17:17:24 2014 UTC,"Like voiddreamer said, it makes it an umbrella term. I use it to be inclusive of people like my SO, who is neutrois. I, personally, am MtF."

I haven't been to the Introduction Thread but then there ain't much to say about myself that my flair-mabob and a few words can't get across.   I'm pansexual guydudemanbro, although, I've found from past experiences and deep thought(And much CaraMac, oh so much CaraMac) that I'm kinda gay as far as romantic interactions go.  On a less introductory note: I'm all help-happy like Pinkie Pie and y'all're rocking the care and compassion for strangers in need stuff! It's heartwarming!"

Like my dream date is taking a gondola down the canal eating light Italian dishes and singing opera at sunset. If I had to compare myself to one of the Mane Six, it'd have to be Rarity. Concerned with looks, cultured, and prone to mental breakdowns and bouts of depression, mixed with a fear of failure.  But screw it I'm here for ponies."
MyLGBTPony,1u76hm,Gayburn_Wright,2,Sun Jan 5 19:04:04 2014 UTC,Heh. I'll admit. I don't have such grand aspirations for a dream date. I'd be content to just cuddle with my SO on my couch or whatever. Opera sounds nice though!

MyLGBTPony,1u76hm,VictorClark,2,Thu Jan 2 23:16:47 2014 UTC,"Well, quite a bit has happened in the past few weeks!  I finally graduated college on the 16th (WOO!!!), and I now have a degree in Broadcast Journalism, with a minor in Theater. I also got a nice tablet for Christmas, so at least I can say I'm more technologically in-tune with other people my age.  Aside from updating my stories Unfamiliar Patterns and my sequel to Brushed Away, Brushed Away 2, I also broke down and finally got a Tumblr account. There barely anything on there right now, but I figured it would be a nice place to add the artwork I gather of my OC's Canvas and Troy, as well as follow some of the blogs I've found over the past few months."
MyLGBTPony,1trvgp,Joshua_the_brony,7,Fri Dec 27 01:01:06 2013 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what makes you feel that way?  More of a sexual desire, or more of a romantic one?  For the sexual side: easiest way is to try masturbating to different things. :3  If you're male, try looking at some solo male or gay porn in addition to whatever else you try. :3  Or just try fantasizing about being with a guy.  Does it arouse you?  (It doesn't have to arouse you as much as it does for the opposite sex--you don't have to be attracted to both equally! :) )  I suppose a more concrete way would be to be with a guy, but that can be difficult, especially if you're trying to be safe about it.  For the romantic side: If you're male, can you imagine having a boyfriend?  Hugging and kissing and cuddling and holding hands just as much as if you were with a girl?  As before, it doesn't have to be the same amount of interest between boys and girls.  It also doesn't have to be the same amount as you feel sexually!  I'm here to chat if you have more questions. :)"

There is nothing good that can come of living at home with people who do not accept that you aren't what they want you to be. I would find someone you can trust and just be your self with them.

Been making things like chili and tacos a lot recently, which is pretty cool. I've also gotten a huge affliction for tuna helper (especially the cheesy pasta stuff). And yeah, chicken has been a great thing to invest in since I can get those huge bags of frozen chicken breasts.

D:  Today was better. :3  One class, and now I'm back home, and my brother is here. :D  I do kinda regret not going with the kink club to a dungeon, but there will be other times. :3  So, I just played some Dark Souls, which is awesome. :3  In other news, a friend confirmed that a friend I'm not out to is okay with trans* people. :3  Doesn't make me any less nervous, but that's nice to know, at least. :)  My favorite foods: Medium Rare Steak, Hamachi Sashimi, and Pad Thai with lime.  There are other things, but those were the first three that jumped into my head. :3  Least favorite food would be most kinds of cheese. :O  There are some exceptions (pizza, caprese salad), but a lot of times, I don't like it, or at least would prefer less of it. :O  Favorite color is dark purple. :3  Not sure what my least favorite is. :O"

I'm halfway through season 2 right now (BTW I had no idea John De Lancie was in this, OMG!!!), and I've gotten the biggest crush on Aaron Paul right now.  My favorite food would probably be anything cheesy and/or spicy: pizza, tacos, nachos, you know the drill.  Least favorite? Um...sour cream? Oh, and mayonnaise. I can't stand that stuff.  And favorite color? Aqua."

MyLGBTPony,1nqn2t,VictorClark,2,Sun Oct 6 11:50:22 2013 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think I have a specific reference. My music tastes are pretty bipolar, so I don't think there's any radio station I would openly dislike (except maybe right-wing shit like Rush Limbague (sp) or Glenn Beck). I'd like to be a DJ for something in music, or maybe do a morning show (I interned for one for a while, and it was a great experience).  And seriously, Breaking Bad is worth watching.

MyLGBTPony,1nqn2t,ScalierLemon1,2,Mon Oct 7 05:54:14 2013 UTC,Life is pretty good. I realized I had a crush on half of the cast of Torchwood. And Doctor Who. And most of the voice actors from MLP. And a lot of the cast of the original Indiana Jones movies.  Favorite food: My cultural foods (Italian food and tea)  Least favorite food: Anything spicier than a mild salsa  Favorite color: Light yellow and aqua  Least favorite color: Any neon colors. They hurt my eyes.

MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,VictorClark,3,Thu Sep 26 05:02:41 2013 UTC,So how are you doing?
MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,anuspony,2,Thu Sep 26 05:36:10 2013 UTC,"Pretty good. Got GTA 5 last week, and I've been playing that like crazy!"
MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,VictorClark,2,Thu Sep 26 06:36:25 2013 UTC,"How did you first know you were X?   This one seems the most straightforward to answer. Week after Christmas, 2002. I had been given a date of the week of Christmas, but that is Exodus Week. So, everyone who had a date for it got shoved to the previous or the following week. I was fortunate enough to get the week after. Arrive at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas for Air Force Basic Training.    One of the folks in my BMT was a total dirtbag. Kind of lazy, didn't do his job, etc. And he was achingly cute. I had a schoolgirl's crush on him. This was not a good sign. I chocked it up to stress and sleep deprivation.   So, I set to sorting it out once I get to tech school. At one point, I corner a chaplain in his office to ask if that was normal. If such things tend to happen under stress. His reply was, paraphrasing, ""No, not really. You're in for suck, I wish you the best of luck."" While I was in Tech School, I had another schoolgirl crush, on a fellow student. He was smart, tall, adorable, a licensed locksmith in the state of Kentucky, and for some damned reason wanted to hang out with me. I had to stifle giggling when he entered the room.   So, I kept my head down and remained celibate for the remainder of my enlistment. Only outed myself to my mother, and the doctor in the ER when I walked in on account of being suicidal. That's another story of frustration, what came after that point. Another day, maybe.   Out of the Air Force and into college, woo. I hit the ground running, becoming active in the GSA-equivalent on campus. Ended up being an officer for it for three of my four years at school. Learned to be an Engineer... hence the handle. While I was there, a friend on the Internet realized he was a guy. And I started wondering about gender. That's how things tend to fall apart, eh? Sweaters and illusions, all you have to do is find that one thread to tug...   So, I start to pondering. And what really, really made me realize that my assumptions had no foundation was when I saw a transition photo of an internet celebrity. Dunno if I can name her, given Dox'n rules, so I'll just note she's a she. It was a photo of her in girl mode, and I realized I was envious. I wanted to be able to be seen as a woman. It bothered me that I couldn't. So, I found a therapist and started gnawing on the issue.   So, I've been on hormones for about two and a half years or so, now. I don't come close to passing, but I don't care. I am me, and I am a woman. To hell if society disagrees. Luckily, the Veteran's Administration changed their ""Go die in a ditch for all we care"" policy about six months before I had to turn to them for medical care.   I look to the future, and I shudder in terror. I don't know what it stands. There's so many things I just don't know. So, one step at a time. I'll survive, I always do."
MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,engineerferret,2,Thu Sep 26 01:31:02 2013 UTC,"/superhugs <3  I know how a lot of this feels. But I was never in the military.  Struggling over sexual identity is a rough road, especially when met with opposition. It compounded my own 7-year long struggle with suicidal depression, which is still ongoing.   But I've forged a great support circle, and I know there are people I can talk to about anything. And I have you guys! MLP has done more for me by introducing me to people I never would've met, who I will remember for the rest of my life.   TL;DR You Guys Rock Hardcore"

I'm going to try and save myself as much as I can these next few weeks. Maybe I can get myself on the right track, but I dunno.  What about you? There are a lot of engineering jobs out there, or so they say."
MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,ZetsuXIII,2,Fri Sep 27 00:22:15 2013 UTC,"I'm from the Ozarks, and come from a fairly conservative (aka redneck) background. Because of that, I went through a long process of denial since middle school regarding myself. Since I was always surrounded by people with homophobic mindsets, I really didn't want to come to terms with the idea that I like men. Fortunately, I was exposed to enough gay culture in media (particularly the episode of The Simpsons with John Waters guest starring) for me to keep an open mind regarding it. I was in denial, but not being a bigot about it.  It wasn't until high school that I was really going under mental stress regarding my sexuality. I kept trying to say to myself 'I'm not gay' in my head, even though the rest of me wasn't listening one bit (interesting how my body knows more about me than my mind sometimes).   Anyways, I remember the night I finally came to terms with myself: February 10, 2007. I was in my room, looking for something (I think it was a bouncy ball), while still saying that damn phrase in my head over and over. Slowly, my mental chants started to change, so that my repeated thought 'I'm not gay' began to remove the 'not' in the middle. Eventually, the 'not' part became so faint that I stopped saying it at all, leaving me to only think one thing. ""I'm.....gay.""  Clarity. Pure, fucking clarity.  I'm still trying to come out to more members of my family; however, I have several friends, all of whom know about me, and I'm feeling pretty content with my life so far."

I kinda always knew I liked guys. I just didn't know there was a word for it, and a whole community and culture to go with that word until my teens. I also like women, but only really in a sexual way. Very little romantics there. As a general rule. There are always exceptions. But whats in a name? A rose by any other name is just as beautiful.   But I prefer tulips. Tulips don't have thorns."
MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,cloppyhooves,2,Thu Sep 26 05:47:38 2013 UTC,"Wait, they had jello and gravy? That's an odd combination. I bet they had the jello shots in a rainbow color. The gravy though, what kind was it? Was there like a dinner party involved with steak and potatoes or something?  I hear ya on the tulips vs. roses thing."
MyLGBTPony,1n4zot,SeasideSunrise,2,Thu Sep 26 12:47:09 2013 UTC,"It was chocolate gravy. Served with biscuits, link sausage, and bacon!  There are plenty of innuendos there, I know. Trust me. But legit, this is my favorite breakfast. Tis amazing food."

I had to deal with a loved one's medical emergency and subsequent recovery, fights and making up with family members, and then getting sick from the stress and lack of sleep. But hey, looks like things are getting back to normal.    I assume the favorite TV show question is ""besides MLP"", hm? My current favorite is Adventure Time. I've been re-watching older Mythbusters episodes as well. I hope that they do more thought experiments and physics myths, as opposed to ""HEY LET'S REENACT MOVIE SCENES AND THEN BLOW SHIT UP!"""
MyLGBTPony,1mm2k5,fyrenwater,3,Wed Sep 18 06:55:34 2013 UTC,Sorry to hear you're so stressed. Hopefully you can just unwind and have a nice weekend.  I love Adventure Time too! I haven't really watched much Mythbusters recently except for the Breaking Bad special. I don't really know why.
MyLGBTPony,1mm2k5,fyrenwater,2,Fri Sep 20 03:06:53 2013 UTC,This weekend looks to be back to typical weekend stuff. There's also plenty of mooncake to enjoy.

My fic Brushed Away has been added to the LGBT group in FimFiction, which is a pretty big deal since that group is so exclusive with their stories. I've also been getting a lot of big projects done for classes this week, so hopefully everything will be done by the time I get my copy of GTA V from Amazon.   Also, I think one of my favorite shows right now (besides MLP) has to be Archer. I didn't expect the show to be that great from first appearances, but DAMN! I am SO glad I gave it a chance! The same goes for Bob's Burgers; thought it was going to blow, turned out to be pants-pissingly funny.  I also like Supernatural, Dr. Who, The Simpsons, and IT Crowd."

For a second, I was wondering if my aunt had found out about me being trans*, and I was a little nervous that she might ask about it.  But, she didn't, so that's still unresolved. :O  I just really wish (as always) there was some way for the rest of the important people who don't know to know without me having to tell them.  It just makes me so anxious and nervous, even if I expect a good reaction. >.<  I start to move back into my dorm this week. :O  That should go smoothly, but it does mean I have dwindling time left at home. D:  I realized that my boobs are more conical than anything, so I have to find a workaround for that and bras while they hopefully fill out a little more. :3  If there even is one, that is. :O  My favorite TV show is ponies! :3  Besides that, I'd say either Adventure Time (even if I haven't seen all of it >.>), Restaurant: Impossible, or Scrubs. :3"

I guess that's lucky with your Aunt, but at the same time, it might have been good to just get it out of the way. I don't really have any experience with any of that kind of stuff, so don't take my word for it.  Yay dorm life! I always liked my dorm a lot more than I liked living at home. Even that one year where I had a rapping rich white kid from the Shore (yes, the Jersey one), that was an asshole and messed with all my shit. I guess it was the freedom and the not being asked questions at all hours.  I believe some people just naturally have more conical breasts. It's not really a bad thing. And they can be quite cute. If I had tips, I'd give 'em, but my boobs are of the man variety . . .   I love Adventure Time!!! Finish it! Finish it now!!! The only thing I don't like is that the episodes keep making me want to watch more. Never watched Restaurant: Impossible, but after looking it up, it sounds interesting. And I've only seen maybe 10 episodes of scrubs, just couldn't get into it. But then again, I've always been an animation kind of person."

Now, though, when I came home after trying to buy some bras (I didn't manage to get any, but didn't tell her about it), she surprised me by saying she bought me two sports bras. :D They fit pretty well, and are especially great with how painful running has gotten. :D She had also found a coupon for a laser clinic by herself, among other things. :)  Besides that, though, transitioning is still slow.

I've also been on a huge Josh Groban binge lately, so I have no idea what my all-time favorite genre is.  Probably more of the 70's level classic rock like Steeley Dan and Supertramp, maybe. Also, Meatloaf.    I've been having a pretty busy week so far. School started last week, so I've been getting used to having a schedule like that again, along with my weekend job.

I tried to play songs the listeners had never heard before, for my shows.  At the moment, my favorite rock band is The Protomen, and my favorite song of their's is The Good Doctor.  My favorite non-rock song, at the moment, is The Caretaker, from the album Seven Dreams by Gordon Jenkins and his band. I love the whole album, but I really like the pacing of that song. If you'd like a scarier one, The Nightmare is the best representation of a nightmare in song that I've ever heard.  In general life, my job appears stable. I know how to do my job. I'm an engineer. I find problems, I solve problems. I hope to not get laid off.  I've got plans for my boyfriend to move in with me, sometime in the next several months. That's promising."

MyLGBTPony,1ken8t,anuspony,3,Thu Aug 15 09:57:13 2013 UTC,Yay growing boobs! :D  Such an awesome feeling when you can definitely tell the growth. :D  (And possibly a little fear if you're not part-time D:)
MyLGBTPony,1ken8t,cloppyhooves,3,Fri Aug 16 02:24:18 2013 UTC,I love it how I can feel them bounce sometimes.
MyLGBTPony,1ken8t,anuspony,2,Fri Aug 16 03:40:05 2013 UTC,"Ooh, yeah! :D  That's always fun! :D  Unless it's the bounce from going down stairs or running that hurts D:"

D:  I dunno if low blood sugar would be an option; I had chai tea and strawberries and blueberries in the morning and chinese food and fizzy juice at lunch.  The blueberries are a teensy bit old, but I didn't have a problem with them before. :O  I research neural networks this summer. :3"
MyLGBTPony,1k896i,cloppyhooves,1 point,Tue Aug 13 05:50:03 2013 UTC,Wow! That sounds cool! What field are you applying your research to? I know Bioinformatics is interested in that. Also there's a decent amount of interested in developing a network that mimics the efficiency of neural nets.  It could be the general lack of protein? I dunno I'm not really an expert.

Here's a live version I found that's really good (although I prefer the studio version TBH). I don't know what it is about Josh Groban, but I've really been on a music binge of his discography recently.  Also, I love my George Foreman grill! Just today I made some chicken ramen on the stove, and I cooked up a chicken breast while the noodles were bubbling so I can have meat with it! I highly recommend it (especially with garlic butter)."

The writing is excellent, the acting is great (although it's weird seeing Hal from Malcom in the Middle cook Meth).

Then uncancelled last minute. This is the second weekend in a row this has happened.  So I spent today listening to Crash Course videos while expanding my house in Minecraft.

This subreddit has a lot of potential, so I don't see why we don't try to incorporate more to it.  Also, I've been fairly fine recently. I finally finished my story on Fimfiction a couple weeks ago (Brushed Away), and I have a friend of mine working on an improved version of the cover art. Right now, he only has a basic outline of the design, but it already looks better than what I have right now.  I've also been getting ready for school starting back up in a couple weeks.

A third of the class was guys and they all took the comment in stride. The guy sitting next to me leaned over and said ""Why can't it be both?"" and winked.  Also took a Women's Bodies class where one discussion turned into the only guy teaching the entire class about self defense, since he was a black belt in something. So that was pretty cool"

MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,Undermine13,8,Thu Mar 14 22:07:43 2013 UTC,"If that actually WERE to happen, I don't think Bronies would be the biggest thing to worry about. If anyone would go into huge bigoted rants about something like that happening in the show, it would be conservative parents.   Remember the episode of Spongebob when Spongebob and Patrick raised a baby clam together? That episode was cute, funny, and relatively safe; however, people got PISSED. Religious groups, dickheaded concerned parents, conservative groups and homophobes constantly trashed the writers and creators because they didn't like the idea of their kids being exposed to ""alternative lifestyles"". And from what I remember, even some pro-gay groups got upset with the episode as well because they thought it didn't give a positive look on gay parenting.   Tons and tons of pissed off people, all because of a fucking cartoon sponge being seen as a mother figure.  As much as I would love to see LGBT issues being brought into light more in cartoons and entertainment for younger audiences, I don't think incorporating it in MLP: FIM will really please anyone. Parents would make boycotts, religious groups will go up in arms, a lot of fans would probably be confused at best, and the writers would most likely get death threats that make the Derpy incident look downright tame!"
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,VictorClark,7,Fri Mar 15 01:19:27 2013 UTC,"The nature of complaints would be different though.   With derpy, people thought they were trying to make a statement that was not actually intended, so they changed it because they thought they were saying something bad on accident.   With something like this, they would be intentionally and knowingly making a controversial statement. In which case complaints won't mean ""you fucked up"" but ""you did something right.""   Plus, they'd come out on top. Remember that time the Archie comic had two guys get married? Huge shitstorm followed by that issue completely selling out in all stores as a backlash against the homophobic rants."
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,AdrianBrony,5,Fri Mar 15 17:59:51 2013 UTC,"Well... I don't exactly know how they would tackle it....they barely even mention the existence of romance in this world. Remember, this is a show for kids who aren't usually at the age where they think about these kinds of things yet.  However, I suppose that it would be a F/F pairing, given that it's closer to the show's target demographic. There would have to be something about ""special somepony, not special somecolt"" and whatnot.  Pairings? I'm not much into the shipping side of things, though I'm pretty sure Appledash is the cutest thing that exists."
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,AdrianBrony,7,Fri Mar 15 01:14:40 2013 UTC,"Well I mean they already opened the door to the matter with the cakes and cadence.   Plus the entirety of hearts and hooves day.   They aren't exactly shy on where foals come from either.   So really, they have already been further down the road than people think. They already alluded to love, marriage, relationships, and yes, even sex.   So I hardly see how they would have a tough time fitted in a same sex couple or homosexual character into what they already have.   I mean, just because it's gay doesn't mean it's any more about sex than a straight couple."
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,HopeFox,5,Fri Mar 15 17:51:42 2013 UTC,"How would the creators go about writing an episode with same-sex romance? Would they treat it like any other episode or would there be some special significance behind it?   I think they would just throw it into the background or sub-plot level of the show. The moral lessons of the show tend to be very general in scope, rather than addressing specific social issues. For example, ""Bridle Gossip"" is obviously applicable as a metaphor for racism, but it's not literally about racism. The show teaches principles that can be applied to real-world issues, rather than addressing them specifically and by name. I think that avoids the show being too heavy-handed in its lessons, and also allows it to age well.   How would the bronies react? Think realistically, because we've already seen what happened when they gave Derpy a voice. Would they cry in joyousness that their OTP is now cannon, or would they lash out with bigoted remarks about the ""grossness"" of same-sex couples?   I... think that's a bit of an unfairly loaded question. Plenty of us would be genuinely happy that same-sex couples are being depicted on a children's show. Plenty of others would be disgusting about it, of course. And yes, the response would differ depending on whether the characters involved were mares or stallions, sad to say.   How would Hasbro react to the inevitable bigoted remarks stated above? Would they stand behind the show in support or cave into the pressure of pleasing everyone?   I think that if Hasbro made the exceptionally brave decision to do this on the show, then they'd stand behind it. If they weren't going to stand behind it, they wouldn't do it in the first place. I believe that their research people are smart enough that they will know what they're getting into by doing this. Oh, and I'm pretty sure they don't care about bigoted bronies, they care about bigoted parents, the ones who don't want to buy ""gay toys"" for their children.  While I'm on the topic, I'd like the say that I'm pretty sure some people at the executive level of the show production team, Hasbro Studios or even Hasbro itself, want to do this, simply on the basis that I don't think all corporate executives are terrible people. However, Hasbro is a public company, and they have to do what their shareholders want. It's an unfortunate reality, and I don't think they're any happier about it than we are.   And, as a bonus, who would be the lucky couple? Don't just throw your OTP in this. Take into account the show itself and the current MLP universe. Out of the characters present, who are the most likely to get together if this opportunity was a reality?   Not any of the Mane Six, for a start. Rarity is the only character who has shown any interest in romance, and I think the writers intend to keep it that way. It's not meant to be a show about romance. And not Rarity, because that would stray too far towards the ""promiscuous bisexual"" stereotype.  The obvious answer is Lyra and Bon-Bon Sweetie Drops, of course. They're already established as very close friends who spend a lot of time together. However, they are both background characters, and I don't think that giving two background characters a major scene just to showcase their sexuality is the right way to approach things.  I think a minor character would be the best way - one who's already established with a personality and a role within the story, but not one of the mane cast. Excluding the minor characters who are already married or otherwise have relationship histories that would make it awkward (and excluding Celestia and Luna because I don't think they should be dating mortals)... I think Spitfire would be the best choice. She's been on the show often enough that she's a meaningful minor character, but we've seen nothing about her relationship history. It would be easy for a Wonderbolts-based Rainbow Dash episode to show Spitfire with her wife."
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,Astronelson,3,Sun Mar 17 06:31:00 2013 UTC,"Spitfire's wife would probably be the best-case scenario, and if they ever decide to have anything of this nature, is roughly what I'd expect it to be.  Cheerilee could be another possibility."
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,IstheLieReallyaCake,-1,Tue Mar 19 12:06:45 2013 UTC,The only thing about that is I can imagine Rainbow Dash being an intolerant dick about it.
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,Almafeta,3,Mon Mar 18 17:58:14 2013 UTC,"I believe that it has been confirmed that Lyra and Bon Bon are a couple in-universe, but that it'll never be a story device, much like Applejacks' dead parents will never be a story device."
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,AdrianBrony,3,Fri Mar 15 04:45:21 2013 UTC,That was done by the layout artist I think. They are ambivalent about the matter.
MyLGBTPony,1ab8oc,actuallycharliebrown,3,Fri Mar 15 17:53:36 2013 UTC,"What if the creators of the show introduced a gay or lesbian couple in the MLP universe?   that'd be super cool, and this generation's queer youth would be so lucky to have role models in a show like this   How would the creators go about writing an episode with same-sex romance?   i think baby cakes--gay couple wants to adopt, mane six tries to progressively help them out, until fluttershy (probably) has to get involved, and finds baby pony (somehow)  or secondary character (im thinking big mac, but that's just because he's 1/2 of my fave mlp pairing--but it works best out of any i can think of) comes out to family member (applejack)  or a cmc uses a gay slur (i think fillyfooler/coltcuddler) and their familymember/rd has to tell them why that's inappropriate  so yeah, plenty of fruit to pick from with plots   Would they cry in joyousness that their OTP is now cannon, or would they lash out with bigoted remarks about the ""grossness"" of same-sex couples?   both  there'd be porn everywhere, furious shoutings of MY OTP WASNT CANON with art of one of the mane six killing the now canon couple, ""WTF!? GAY=GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""  it'd honestly be a pr disaster for fim and everyone involved   who would be the lucky couple?    i'd like caramac, but who cares about a couple? if there's just one pony, grappling to terms with their sexuality, that's fine imo"

I can say from personal experience that this one of the best interpretations regarding the internal struggles of coming out, and it really mirrored the experience I had when I came out to my older sister. It just warms my heart every time I read it.  As for writings, I just recently started getting into reading fanfiction; however, I will say that I've really gotten into Octascratch shipping. On that note, some stories I would highly recommend include Allegrezza, Vinyl and Octavia: University Days (Still in Progress), and Accidental Harmony.

MyLGBTPony,1a2d53,HopeFox,3,Wed Mar 13 04:42:02 2013 UTC,HAVE ALL MY HUGS!
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,Undermine13,16,Wed Mar 6 04:39:50 2013 UTC,"TL;DR: The show can mean different things to different people. It's the people who apply it to their own lives. The messages of the show are intentionally left as neutral as possible so it can apply to everyone in one way or another.  There's a literary concept known as ""Applicability"" that is heavily relevant to this.  See, Applicability is the quality of a story to fit different interpretations. It lets the readers/viewers/audience apply the concepts, setting, characters, events, and lessons of a work in a way that is most relevant to them.  Take the episode Dragon Quest for example. Spike has an identity crisis and does not know what he is. He sets out to define what he is by going to people who he THINKS are like him because they LOOK like him, but he finds out that they aren't indicative of him.   Spike ultimately learns that ""what you are"" is not as important as ""who you are.""  The applicability, however, is in the ""what"" part. For instance, a person going through foster homes might feel like it addresses his own lack of identity because of a stable family, citing how Spike's family isn't even the same species.  A now take a genderfluid person. They notice the same message, but they get different themes from the episode. They see how Spike is perfectly comfortable with being feminine AND being masculine, in a sort of patchwork way. one minute he's in a frilly pink apron and not embarrassed, but he also has been known to check out his muscles in the mirror.   They identify with Spike because the episode is very applicable. Different traits resonate with different people to fit their lives.  For that reason, I don't mind about how people interpret the characters. If a person struggling with their sexuality imagines that Caramel and Braeburn are romantically interested in each other, and that interpretation helps them come to terms with their sexuality, then more power to them."
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,AdrianBrony,10,Wed Mar 6 06:06:59 2013 UTC,"Pretty much the only gay thing I see about it are the queer shipping options. And that seems to be because of the sheer number of female characters. But by that logic, shows with straight shipping options are straight shows. Which.... I suppose they sort of are, simply by straight being the ""default"" in our heteronormative society.  ...But that's not the point. There are storylines that can be seen as stand-ins for queer issues, but also ones that touch on other topics. Ethnic and racial issues (unicorn VS pegasus VS earthen), identity issues (Spike and his dragon-ness), anxiety issues (Twilight), bully issues (Gilda, Trixie), etc.  tl;dr: yes there are stories that appeal to those dealing with queer issues, but also ones for all sorts of societal and interpersonal issues."
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,fyrenwater,6,Wed Mar 6 06:53:09 2013 UTC,"I think Spike's character has a lot of queerness to his storylines, especially the dragon migration stuff.  But the show as a whole? It's definitely feminist and very queer-friendly, but not 'gay' in any over way I don't think."
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,gogoedward,4,Wed Mar 6 18:44:45 2013 UTC,That episode made me cry so hard. It just resonated so strongly with my own story as a queer trans woman.
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,Polkadot_Girl,6,Wed Mar 6 22:29:44 2013 UTC,"In my opinion there are only 2 ways that a show could be ""gay"".   If the target audience of the show are gays... Which in this case I would say that it isn't. The abstract idea that the show is attracted to other shows of its gender - but that's just me being crazy, obviously.   This is just my opinion on what makes a show ""gay"". With this in mind, I wouldn't call ""Will and Grace"" a ""gay"" show, though I'm sure a lot of people would.  TL;DR: Nah."
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,danishdingo,7,Wed Mar 6 07:48:09 2013 UTC,"I'm gay, and I love this show, but those things about me don't happen to overlap.  I just happen to be gay, and MLP just happens to be that awesome ^_^"
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,Androecian,5,Wed Mar 6 10:03:20 2013 UTC,"Huh. While I wouldn't immediately consider MLP to be a show that's supposed to be directed towards the gay community, I can see where people could get that idea. Some of the largest themes of the show are about friendship and acceptance, there have been several episodes regarding why it's not right to judge or ignore others, the show has several characters which could be seen as challenging gender expectations (Spike, Rainbow Dash, etc.), and the show has a surprisingly small hereto normative stigma with the main characters in comparison to other shows directed towards the same age and gender groups (none of the Mane 6 have been in relationships, or show much interest for any besides Rarity).   However, I wouldn't really think of Friendship is Magic as a show directed toward those in the LGBT community. If anything, I think gay people like the show in the same way Bronies did: while the show was supposed to be directed toward little girls, all of the positive qualities the show carries (animation, writing, effort) make the simple concept and characters more relatable and interesting to those outside the intended audiences. The show managed to be so successful because of it's power of interpretation; people are able to see and understand the show in their own light, and are able to enjoy it because it's something they can easily follow and connect with."
MyLGBTPony,19r9n1,VictorClark,2,Wed Mar 6 06:11:04 2013 UTC,"One thing I've really noticed about the show is the level of platonic intimacy between the characters. They share beds and baths without even a hint of the ""eww, gay"" jokes that other shows might have. Many of us live in societies wherein shows of physical affection between two people of the same sex, whether platonic or romantic, are discouraged, and that's a bad thing. Anything which combats that is good, I think."
MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,Undermine13,8,Thu Feb 28 02:00:04 2013 UTC,"People outside of the LGBT spectrum are used to always being able to relate directly to their media, whereas LGBT folk for quite some time have had to ""read between the lines"", sometimes in places where there is an actual allusion, and other times where a character just fits in that mold.   People who are non-LGBT usually don't have this problem, of having to sort of kludge their interpretation of a character to find a relatable situation: usually, it is just presented to them directly. So when someone actually has to bend an interpretation, they see this as extreme or forced, whereas for us LGBT folk it's par for the course. That, and for some they see these topics as being ""too mature"" for children (sexuality, gender and gender roles)... Thus, since you are dealing with primarily children's media...  That, and quite a few people think you are crazy if you read into subtext (""It's just a children's cartoon! You're thinking too deeply about it.""), even though that's almost certainly what most writers are going for.  Those are my theories, anyway."
MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,NateSoli,4,Thu Feb 28 02:43:52 2013 UTC,"Blushes Awe, you read my threads. Yeah I was a little miffed at how the MLP board basically just shat all over my discussion because of a small  semantic about the title of the thread."
MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,VioletHyena,3,Thu Feb 28 15:06:37 2013 UTC,"I'm also interested to see what people say.  Personally I see no issues talking LGBT stuff with the bronies I know, but then again all the bronies I know in person are LGBT -I pretty much live out of LGBT circles socially, I don't get out except for work & the local LGBT adult group in my town-."
MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,MissInvincible,2,Thu Feb 28 03:29:15 2013 UTC,"I think they get a different amount of upvotes because members of a subreddit with LGBT in its name are more likely to care about LGBT issues than members of a more general subreddit.  Also, I didn't agree with the the author of the blog post and thought she was jumping to conclusions to an extent that made it not worth upvoting for visibility.  So another reason it might not have gotten upvotes is because the claim made by the author was contested.  Bronies aren't any more homophobic than normal people, and are likely less so, given the fact that they can't really make fun of people for defying gender norms."
MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,erosPhoenix,1 point,Thu Feb 28 04:26:17 2013 UTC,"I think the title was unfortunately misleading, rather than reading as ""hey look this works as a great simile for explaining the feelings of Trans folks"" it was read as ""this ending was made as a simile for how Trans people feel"".    As for the claim being contested as a Trans person myself I think the author's claim was right, it seems like most of the posts contesting it were from cis folks which felt kind of like a single straight girl contesting a topic about the home lives of married gay men.  I saw a few brave Trans folks identify themselves as such & chime in on the positive.  Not saying that it's all that way, but the main voice that should matter on the validity of the idea should be that of Trans people, and the few that I saw that identified themselves as such supported the post.  Edit:formatting"
MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,MissInvincible,3,Thu Feb 28 04:49:59 2013 UTC,"I guess I should have said that I personally didn't feel that the episode was a good metaphor for transgenderism.  I feel that Dragon Quest, on the other hand, can work well in that regard."

MyLGBTPony,19d9zc,MissInvincible,2,Thu Feb 28 05:30:33 2013 UTC,"This is one of few pony-related communities I still take part in because of this reason (and others, unfortunately). Casual usage of slurs and hatred as ""jokes"", then telling those who get hurt that it's ""part of the community, deal with it."" I wish I could say that this is from the minority of the scum that dwells in the shadier sections of the community, but sadly, I face a lot more of that than people who call them out.  It's a sad combination of a small number of assholes, then people who go along (out of ignorance or because they want to fit in), indifferent people who don't do anything due to apathy, people who stay quiet because they fear speaking up, and the few who keep fighting and are promptly targeted because ""ur helpin them that means ur a faget!!""  Keep fighting. The whole community needs to change in order to make this shit no longer socially acceptable."

MyLGBTPony,17xb17,akinokaze,4,Thu Feb 7 23:02:13 2013 UTC,"Sex and gender are different things. Sex is the physical aspect - reproductive organs, breast shape, hip width, adam's apple. Gender is what sex someone feels like on the inside, mentally. For the majority of people, these are the same, but for some, they feel on the inside like a different gender from their sex. It can be a very stressful, intense feeling of something being very wrong. I can't describe the exact feeling because I've never experienced it besides possibly very mildly, and it varies for different individuals. I hope I'm not misrepresenting some subtlety of it, but that's what I know about it from reading about others' experiences.  Also congratulations on grabbing the name pingas, hah"

I've noted a few things I'm interested in hearing about there.  In general, though, what I'm looking for is any advice from the transgender community about what y'all would like to see in a transgender character. I hope that my primary goal (basically of normalizing him) is a good one but I don't really know beyond that how much his character should focus on that part of who he is."
MyLGBTPony,xefxe,FollowerofLoki,5,Mon Jul 30 23:13:40 2012 UTC,"Reading your update...um, wow. Okay, so. Have you ever watched the film Boys Don't Cry? About the brutal rape and murder of Brendan Teena? Because that seems to be almost what you're riffing on here.   Not that it doesn't sound interesting but...I'm gonna be honest. I do not like the idea of one of the characters intending to rape the Trans* character. That is a fairly typical trope in most fiction involving Trans* characters and it really bugs me when rape is used as a plot device.   Flirting with girls: If your character is straight or bisexual, than he's going to be basically like any other guy flirting with a girl. Maybe nervous, maybe overcompensating and being a little goofy. Maybe nervous in deciding whether or not to reveal his Trans* status to her, unless he's open about being Trans already? It can be very hard for those of us in the transgender community to come out to partners because of the potential for violence. Is that something that's likely to happen?"
MyLGBTPony,xefxe,FollowerofLoki,3,Mon Jul 30 23:25:30 2012 UTC,"Boys Don't Cry has been recommended to me and I'm making a point to check it out.  I appreciate the honesty. I really do. That's the biggest reason I wasn't sure if I wanted to include that scene or not so if the kinds of responses I get about that echo yours even just half the time, I'll probably leave it out.  As for his sexuality, I'm not exactly sure about that now that I think about it. He's grown up in an isolated community so everyone kinda knows about him. I don't know if that would lead him to withdraw and resign himself to being alone the rest of his life or if he'd still make an effort and if so where that would lead him.  The character who comes on to him certainly looks like the type that'd make him worry about the potential for violence, but he's an able fighter in his own right and he'd have confidence he'd be able to fight her off if he had to."
MyLGBTPony,xefxe,Slotos,6,Mon Jul 30 23:48:04 2012 UTC,"I really do think leaving the rape scene out is a good way to go. If you've seen any sort of trans* literature, media, or whatever, there is almost always some sort of sexual misconduct on the part of someone else towards the Trans* person. It ain't cool and it makes me a sad panda.   Well, a good chunk of people are straight, so it's likely he might be. (It's your character, at any rate. :) ) Personally, and this is just me, seeing a transgender character just have a relationship, without much in the way of reference to him beings tran* would be nice, but I know that makes for a boring story.   If you're looking for perspective from a cis partner of trans people, you could try /r/mypartneristrans."
MyLGBTPony,xefxe,preternaturous,1 point,Tue Jul 31 00:04:46 2012 UTC,"Well, there are stories like that, in a way. I.e. Glasshouse by Charles Stross depicts people easily switching genders without any repercussions. It delivers a message of a ""deal with it"", but it doesn't really show how indifference and susceptibility to peer pressure makes life hard for normal people that don't fit some arbitrary criteria.  The pure suffering doesn't do that either. It does ask you to cry but it doesn't provide a fought for normal ending. Not a happy ending with three wishes granted, no. Just an ability to be who you are with people you like without the need to assume a defensive stance. And I hope we achieve this with ""Kevin"".  The thing is, a lot of people have experienced something like that. There's almost always a memory of being alienated or humiliated for what you like, do or are. But people tend to forget that. We're trying to remind them. It's just a matter of delivering a ""you've been there yourself"" message. Justâ€¦"

MyLGBTPony,xbf9l,Zyber17,5,Sun Jul 29 03:45:54 2012 UTC,"Alright.  The biggest problem I have with the story is that there's no conflict.  And no conflict means no real reason for the reader to be interested.  It's also a bit unrealistic for someone questioning their gender to get through it this easily (unless Equestria is an incredibly progressive society.)  The other problem is with the first scene, with the teacher explaining gender.  The details read less like a story and more like a brief summary of the modern understanding of gender (which I also feel would not be taught that way, even in a progressive society.  The way our society perceives gender is related to our culture, but the teacher makes it seem like it's absolute facts of life).  It's also not really necessary to the plot of the story, and the story would be off to a faster start without it.  Really, in summary, it' not much of a story.  I don't mean to discourage you, but really, the story needs... more.  More character development.  More conflict.  More emotional investment.  You need to give the reader a reason to care about what happens to Hoity Toity.  I hope this helps."
MyLGBTPony,xbf9l,erosPhoenix,6,Sun Jul 29 05:40:44 2012 UTC,"I had considered this exact thought while writing.  To be honest, the reason there's no ""conflict"" is simply because I haven't faced any conflict in my own journey of self-discovery.  I wouldn't want to write something I myself haven't faced, simply for fear of misrepresenting it.  I tried to have some ""Man v. Self"" conflict, but perhaps I made it a little too light.  I meant Equestria to be an incredibly progressive, idealized society when it came to gender.  Perhaps this is just because I wish it to be a Utopia of sorts.  The first scene helps provide a background to those unfamiliar to the concepts of gender.  One of my goals when writing was making sure that the terms and ideas would be accessible to even those who didn't know as much, so that hopefully it would have a wider appeal than just those interested in gender.  Perhaps things would be different in Equestria in terms of how it's taught, but then the story itself would be a little different.  Again, I'm writing this based closely on my experiences, which is perhaps why it doesn't have the character development you seek.  I'm not likely to alter it from its current form, because I'm happy with how it stands in representing both myself and what I want it to.  I'm greatly sorry if it seemed boring or a waste of time.  I haven't written about something like this before, but it seems I have some work to do if I want to keep writing it.  Thank you very much for reading it and considering it."
MyLGBTPony,xbf9l,erosPhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 29 06:13:31 2012 UTC,"You're welcome.  I acknowledge that I'm just one person, and am by no means an absolute authority.  While I congratulate you on your own self-discovery, and I recognize that you yourself did not face significant backlash, that doesn't change the fact that I still don't think the story is particularly engaging.  And while I understand your desire to provide a background for readers unfamiliar with gender, I feel that there are better ways to introduce that information into the story than via infodump.  I wish you the best of luck on any future writing projects or self-discovery attempts."
MyLGBTPony,xbf9l,Siskquatch,4,Mon Jul 30 02:04:19 2012 UTC,"So allow me to counterpoint your comment here if I may. :)  Reading through your criticisms I find a large majority of them to be highly subjective and for the most part irrelevant.  First of all, regarding the lack of conflict. While, yes, there is a distinct lack of a major conflict, there has still been provided a little bit of that self-doubt, look into Hoity's mindset that allows the reader to get an idea for what he's feeling. In a slice-of-life style story of this nature, usual the reader's interest is intended to be drawn more by the personal journey the character goes through and thus, the conflict is less important than understanding the character and where they're coming from.  This leads me to the second point. The lesson from the teacher in the beginning was absolutely necessary in establishing an emotional starting point for Hoity and in creating a base for his acceptance later on. In a cartoon show such as this which doesn't really delve into deeper subjects it is up to the writer of such stories expanding that world to create how they feel such things would go. The description was taught much like a teacher especially on from a progressive or liberal background and though you may not think that that sort of thing should go on at school, in the society hoovsies has developed, such a lesson is clearly normal.  I'm confused that you tell the author that they need ""more"" immediately after advocating the removal of the very thing which establishes the premise of the story. It seems less like there's a lack of emotionally investment on the part of the story and more like a refusal on your part to acknowledge what the story is trying to present."
MyLGBTPony,xbf9l,erosPhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 29 07:17:01 2012 UTC,"The lesson from the teacher in the beginning was absolutely necessary in establishing an emotional starting point for Hoity and in creating a base for his acceptance later on.   A journey of self-discovery begins with the self.  Hoity's interest in the lesson seems to imply that he has already begun questioning himself.  Thus, it's not really the starting point.   a refusal on your part to acknowledge what the story is trying to present.   I'm not sure what you're trying to insinuate."
MyLGBTPony,xbf9l,Siskquatch,1 point,Mon Jul 30 02:11:55 2012 UTC,"While yes, he'd begun questioning himself already, he didn't start exploring that side of his personality until presented with the options as he was in the lesson. The teacher's lesson gave him more to work from than just ""male or female"" and established an emotional base that allowed him to delve a little further into his feelings. At least, that's how it came across to me.  I wasn't insinuating something so much as conjecturing that it wasn't a lack of emotional connection in the story but you being unable to connect with the hooks that already existed. That's not intended as an insult. Really, I just felt that a lot of what you said was more personal opinion, whereas the comment itself read more like ""this is how it is"" if that makes any sense. It does in my head at least. Suppose I could have said that without an unnecessarily long rebuttal but where's the fun in that?"

I definitely wouldn't want to misrepresent how it would go, so I just stuck with internal conflict, which I may have made a bit light, unfortunately (again, because I haven't seen much in my experiences).

MyLGBTPony,ulle9,erosPhoenix,11,Tue Jun 5 04:49:56 2012 UTC,"*waves* Hi there! You might want to try posting this on /r/genderqueer, /r/DualGender, /r/asktransgender or even /r/MaleFemme. At least two of the /r/genderqueer mods enjoy ponies, myself included, and we've got 1,147 readers.  I'm reading it as I write this post, so my questions and observations might be a little disjointed. I also made a lot of grammatical notes.  Alright, here goes:     It shouldn't be this tough, I told myself. You're Strong. A ferocious beast. A dragon. A real man.   Why is strong capitalized?  The bit where you're referencing the conversation with Rainbow Dash before Spike's flashback to the actual conversation is a little awkward and creates a little confusion in the reader, but it does hook the reader into reading more to figure out what Spike's talking about.   ""I don't know if anypony's told you this, Spike, but there's more than one way to be a girl. It's not like a cookie cutter template or anything.""   This is an excellent point, and one that the show drives home very well. I like how including it here parallels the way that Spike is learning that there's more than one way to exhibit gender. There's more than one way to be just about anything.  Rainbow calls herself a ""fillyfooler""... is that supposed to imply lesbianism or pedophilia? It seems to do both. I'm guessing you're referencing the way Rainbow and Scootaloo get shipped together often?   ""I'm not girly. That doesn't mean I'm not a girl.""   I get this myself, sometimes, because of the way I usually present in public. I feel it's very apt to include it here; good job!  This part where Spike is contemplating telling Rarity first is interesting, but I don't think it's something he would ever do because he's got a massive crush on her which would likely prevent him from confiding in her first. Spike's right, Rarity does define a significant amount of her personality on the fact that she's a cultured lady.   I also like the way that Rainbow reflects that being a colt ""wouldn't be be better or worse. Just, you know, different."" It highlights the way different ponies perceive gender. Also, the way Rainbow doesn't have to think about it is reminiscent of the way most people will never have to think about whether they are male or female, they just are... most people never question their gender. It's not a fault, it's just something that doesn't occur to most people.   I guess it's also important to note here that ""colt"" means a young male pony, while ""filly"" means a young female pony, but this is only until the pony is 3 or 4 years old. For adults over 4, the terminology is usually ""stallions"" and ""mares."" Ponies under a year old are called ""foals"" regardless of gender. Hence my confusion earlier about the ""fillyfooler"" word, since it could reference ponies that are both young and female.   How could something like that not matter to her?   Yet again, this is a big question for Spike, trying to define who he is and where he fits... but for Rainbow, it's no big deal. Her gender has never been in question, she's simply never had the need to question that aspect of herself.   But now they'd see me emasculated, castrated, a world away from everything I was supposed to be.   ""Castrated"" might be a slightly too harsh word to use here. Forgive the pun, but it's a bit sharp. It's entirely up to you, just an observation.   ""I want you to be comfortable,"" she said. ""I want you to feel safe and secure. We all do. If there's something bothering you, hurting you, then it's hurting us to.""   This line should end with ""hurting us, too."" I like this line, it really speaks to the care, compassion, and love that Twilight feels towards Spike. This is the moment when we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Spike has come to the right pony to unload these issues.   ""You bet I'm mad,"" I bellowed. ""Element of Loyalty my scales.""   I think you need a comma here, so it reads ""Element of Loyalty, my scales.""   ""But she was being loyal,"" finished Twilight. ""To me.""   Clever, that. Well done. :D   ""Why don't you you tell me?"" I asked bitterly.   You've got two ""you""s here, when you only need one.   Twilight turned away, avoiding my gaze. I realized that I'd really hurt he with my remark, but I didn't care. It was true.   Needs to be a ""her"" here, rather than a ""he""... simple typo, but I thought you should know.   ""No,"" I said, cutting her off. ""I'm talking now. No matter what I do, you always treat me like a child who can't make her own decisions.   Should read ""his own decisions"" unless that was intentional self-identification on Spike's part.   ""[...] The fact that I'm forced to live with paranoid, possessive ponies such as yourselves?"" How do you honestly expect me to trust you with my secrets when you've never trusted me a bit!""   You've got an unnecessary quote there at the end of ""yourselves?"" For the whole paragraph, you just need the quote at the end of ""a bit!"" You might consider adding a comma behind ""possessive ponies"" and rewording it a little so it reads ""paranoid, possessive ponies, like you?"" That makes the accusation a little more direct.   ""Because I really really want to start trusting you.""   This line probably needs a comma between really, really.   There weren't any girl dragons. Just a bunch of guys.   Yeah; I'd noticed that, too. Hopefully we'll have some female dragons in Season 3 or something. A lot of the masculine characters in MLP:FiM conform to very masculine stereotypes, and I'd appreciate it if they had more depth as well, like the female characters. Regardless of gender, I feel that repetitive supporting characters should have a little depth to them, with their own motivations and perspectives.   Between you and me, I'm honestly surprised Garble knew how to read.""   It might be useful to remind the reader who Garble is, such as ""I'm honestly surprised that red dragon, Garble, even knew how to read."" You could substitute ""that red dragon"" for ""their ringleader"" or something else... just a little something to prompt the reader's memory of that character.   ""And I don't know if I'm a boy either. I think that maybe I never was.   There should be an end quote on the end of this line.   For a moment neither of us spoke.   This line probably needs a comma so it reads: ""For a moment, neither of us spoke.""   where a pony can break sound the barrier   Should be ""where a pony can break the sound barrier""   Twilight invited the others but didn't tell them what for.   Try ""Twilight invited the others, but didn't tell them why"" so your sentence doesn't end with a preposition.   Fluttershy was the first to speak up. ""So you're, like, a girl?""  ""I don't know,"" I confessed, ""Maybe. Or maybe I'm neither. Maybe the whole two-ways-about-it isn't true for me. But I've got time to figure it out.""   This is very telling. This part is where Spike identifies himself as questioning, where he thinks he might be genderqueer. The whole story leads up to this one particular spot... and I'll admit I read right over it the first time I read this. Missing this left me with some questions at the end, as you can see in the strike-through part below. Maybe a little more emphasis might help? Perhaps Pinkie (or Applejack) has a question about how you can be both or neither gender? Maybe not and the fault just lies with me because it's 6:00 AM and I missed it on my first reading. (I don't know why I'm awake so early, either, I just couldn't sleep.)   Rarity was next. ""Well, it doesn't matter to me in the least, Spikey-Wikey. I've been around you long enough to know what you really are.   There needs to be an end quote at the end of this line.  I appreciate that Pinkie called Spike a ""silly filly"" at the end there; that feels like open acceptance of Spike's gender identity.   The story leaves me with a few questions: Is Spike genderqueer or transgender? Is he dual gender? Is he giving up his masculinity entirely? How will these revelations affect his crush on Rarity, who likely sees him as something of a younger sibling? I read the story again, I've got it now.    All in all, I really enjoyed it. Sorry that I slipped into copy-editor mode there for a moment; it's an old habit. I think the emotions were articulated very well, and I think you did an excellent job of displaying Spike's nervousness and his thoughts while he is trying to articulate his feelings. I feel the whole story wraps up nicely and neatly, and I feel that it was written very well.  Here's the wiki entry on genderqueer. As you can see, Spike doesn't have to conform to either gender role, really, he can be whichever he feels suits him best. This would align with some of his more masculine behaviors from the show, while also upholding some of his more feminine behaviors as well. To me, being genderqueer is not always about being male or female, sometimes it's about the freedom to be one or the other, or both, or neither. It's up to the person to act with regards to their emotions and their own sense of gender and social roles.  Edit: User /u/QTPlatypus found this article and I think it might be helpful and relevant to you.  Edit 2: Please note, I used masculine pronouns for Spike in this posting because those are the pronouns he goes by in the show. I do not mean to disparage your characterization of Spike's gender identity by referencing him with male pronouns.  Edit #N: Some additional grammatical and formatting corrections, with a little extra explanation about horse words and how they relate to a pony's gender and age."
MyLGBTPony,ulle9,CedarWolf,2,Tue Jun 5 09:05:41 2012 UTC,"Thanks so much.  I read through your response quickly, and I'll read it again later, but for now I'll say this:  ""fillyfooler"" is fanon slang for lesbianism. It's pretty common, and I'm surprised you've never heard it before. Generally it's treated in stories as a word that's only slightly derogatory, but not enough to prevent actual gay characters from using it themselves.  The male equivalent is ""coltcuddler."""

MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,JustAnotherGDB,9,Mon Apr 2 16:10:43 2012 UTC,"I agree with you on all accounts, and I was happy to see that that was the general attitude back on the mane sub. I recall the term, ""Nobody's headcanon is more valid than anybody else's""."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,Birchy,7,Mon Apr 2 21:45:44 2012 UTC,"I see no problem with shipping. I mean, we're creating fan canons all the time. Every time someone does fanart (especially comics or fanfics), they're ""putting words in the characters' mouths"", unless they're recreating exactly something that happened in the canon. (Which would be no fun!)  Especially when it's background characters. Thinking or saying that two ponies (who do not even have voices or names in a lot of cases!) look like they may be romantically involved doesn't seem like a far stretch at all.  Of course, some people always take it too far, but there are annoying fans for everything.  However, shipping OCs with canon characters is a different matter entirely..."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,SilverRainclouds,2,Tue Apr 3 05:40:52 2012 UTC,"Indeed, just rehashing the exact same stuff the show puts out wouldn't be any fun at all!  Shipping adds, I don't know, a little pizzazz or something.  Like I said in the intro post, sure it's not canonical, and I know that, but it's amusing to think up stories involving the lesser known characters on the show.  Gives those background ponies a bit more character development (even if it IS all within the minds of the fans)."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,16bitMike,6,Tue Apr 3 05:48:39 2012 UTC,"Lyra-Bon = My OTP. I like shipping. It's just another fun part of any fanbase that takes the universe and expands it in a way that will most likely never happen in any canon. Some people get butthurt by it, which I really don't understand, but in my opinion it leads to a better interaction inside the fanbase."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,VictorClark,4,Tue Apr 3 17:33:21 2012 UTC,"I'm honestly not a fan of shipping or character pairings overall, but mostly because it's usually done between characters I wouldn't imagine being together. In the case of MLP, I don't particularly feel comfortable seeing established characters like the Mane 6 in romantic relationships that are never established or noted in the show. When I see two characters from the show who have no relationship in the show get shipped together, it just feels forced and unneeded.  However, in the case of background characters like Lyra/Bob-Bon or Vinyl Scratch/Octavia, it doesn't feel as unnatural or forced because it's between charcters that were never really given development in the first place. There's no real reason for me to be weirded out by Lyrabon or Octascratch because I don't know much about the characters anyway.   Overall, I have no real problem with shipping; it doesn't hurt me and I shouldn't impose on other people's interests (as a Gay Brony that would make a HUGE hypocrite). I only feel uncomfortable with shipping when it involves characters I couldn't imagine being together in the show's universe."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,Herbal_Combat,5,Tue Apr 3 19:15:20 2012 UTC,"As a shipper myself, I just consider it a fun part of fandom. I don't take it seriously. I don't care if it's something that makes sense, a crack pairing, or an OCxCanon. It's all inconsequential to me.  I wish I had something more insightful to add, but it seems like all the bases are covered."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,Sandlicker,3,Tue Apr 10 10:32:44 2012 UTC,"Background ships don't really bother me, because the characters are completely open for interpretation. Certain others that seem somehow plausible don't really push my buttons (like fluttermac for example). Shipping the mane 6 with any of each other weirds me out, simply because they are all pretty non-sexual (or asexual?) and it seems like it goes against their character. That being said, my personal taste is only mine and I don't really care what other people do. I don't click on links I don't want to follow."
MyLGBTPony,rpnwc,dragonblade629,3,Mon Jul 2 23:13:14 2012 UTC,"Shipping for the most part is not to be taken seriously. Granted, certain ships, like Lyra-Bon and Scratchtavia, are between characters that lack development to say otherwise and it would be cute if they developed into full blown parts of the story, but their still meaningless until then."

MyLGBTPony,r5aic,SilverRainclouds,6,Tue Mar 20 18:48:53 2012 UTC,"This is not a fascinating or heart warming story, but it's amusing so I shall tell it.  When I was young (around 15) and living with my dad, he asked me one day, ""So you like girls too, huh?"" I responded, ""Yea, I guess."" and he shrugged and went on with his day. That was it. No big deal. My dad always knew more about me than I did. He always seemed to know what's up; I never had to tell him. He was always open with me when it came to difficult and confusing topics. I don't think he ever really understood my sexuality, but he accepted it, and that's all I asked.  Beyond that, I'm a very private person. I don't advertise my sexuality or gender identity, nor do I try to hide it. If people ask, I tell them. If they don't, I leave them to speculate. It doesn't really bother me. The only people who need to know are me and my partner.  Though, I did have my share of hardship growing up. I knew, even when I was little, that I was 'different'. I didn't like boys as much as the other girls did, even when we were little, and it confused me and made me angry with myself. Ever since I knew the difference between genders, I knew that I did not feel right with my own. This was long before I knew that not all girls liked boys, and vice versa. I struggled to fit in, and I forced myself into a lot of uncomfortable places and abusive relationships because I wanted so badly to be normal. (I guess this is where the heartwarming bit is, in that I finally discovered who I am, and am now in a happy, healthy relationship with someone who respects and cares for me.)  As far as being a Brony, I never tried to hide it, so I never had to come out."
MyLGBTPony,r5aic,AJM69,4,Tue Mar 20 23:41:19 2012 UTC,"I made a thread about it none too long ago. It was rather purging and emotional to retell this for the first time, so apologies if some things get a little stream-of-consciousness."
MyLGBTPony,r5aic,ChromeCrash,4,Tue Mar 20 18:56:45 2012 UTC,"not very heart warming, I didn't face adversity, or anything like that, but I knew I was bi for a while, I had come to the conclusion after my most last romantic partner, I was just all ""I could totally fall in love with a dude,"" and sometime before this most recent Christmas, I ended up telling my parents. They were cool, like normal. My parents, are cool by the way, they're like Dave Strider (essentially dave strider is the archetypal Cool Kid, for those of you who don't read homestuck.) edit: fixed grammar and spelling errors."
MyLGBTPony,r5aic,videogamesizzle,3,Wed Mar 21 18:38:42 2012 UTC,"Coming out as gay was pretty much just a process. I started with a girl who told me she liked me (kind of an awkward conversation, but she's awesome), told some more friends when they asked (who had already guessed), told my parents (who had already figured it out), and I eventually just stopped caring about who knew.  As for the Brony thing, I just told my friends when it came up, and my parents figured it out when I put up the giant Derpy poster in my room XD I always just thought of it as enjoying something strange, like the punk rocker who loves opera or something. Nothing to make a big deal about."
MyLGBTPony,r5aic,JohnAdamZiolkowski,3,Tue Mar 20 22:58:58 2012 UTC,"I came out first to my sisters, then to my friend's mom, then to my friends, but I'm still pretty shy about it.  I don't purposefully hide it (except from my mother), but it normally doesn't come up.  I throw jokes around every once in a while to feel my classmates and coworkers out... but I'm still to scared to be proud :/"
MyLGBTPony,r5aic,dragonblade629,1 point,Wed Mar 21 07:20:26 2012 UTC,"I never really ""came out"", per say, nor am I really in the closet. I'm not super vocal about it because I don't want my bisexuality to be how people define me. I share, pretty much, the same view as Anderson Cooper, and actually it hurt me whenever I read the criticism about why he was sort of hiding it. If it ever becomes relevant, then, I'll be open to say it in a casual manner, but otherwise I'm just quiet about my sexuality."
