nyc,3e30gq,nkvenugopal,18,Tue Jul 21 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"The secret to the school’s success is not simply which students they pick, administrators say (although they do get to choose – last year 2,800 students applied for 150 seats)   This is huge.   I was a teacher in the poorest congressional district in the South Bronx for 6 years.    Three types of students stand out:   Those with learning/emotional disabilities.  Probably about half of our students had some sort of set back like this.  Many undiagnosed.  Did it really matter if it was named?  Not really.  We tried to meet every student at their level.  The model now is total inclusion.  I would have a Regents chemistry class with students who didn't know the number line to students who couldn't write the alphabet.  There were also students who were so disruptive, others would threaten to beat them up.  I still had one of the highest pass rates ever for the Regents at the school.  Students have severely fucked up personal lives.  They were in gangs, they were prostitutes all night (and so slept all day), they were living without parents in places without electricity.    They were recent immigrants.  You have a 17 year old pregnant girl from tribal Africa whose 40 year old husband and family is still there.  She speaks Wolof.  She laughs when you try to explain dinosaurs.  If she doesn't learn World History, US History, American/English Literature, 2 Sciences, and Math, in 3 years, you fail as a school.     You have a class with a combo of these kids who need intense, remedial attention and you are severely hindered.    On top of that there are no discipline codes or enforcements, no parental backups, half the staff are new teachers...  The teachers at my school were the most intelligent, hard working, and loving people I have ever met.  But there is only so much you can do in a 55 minute class with 34 students.    It honestly didn't matter how much they paid me, there was NOTHING more I could do.  I didn't sleep and hardly ate for 6 years.    If you can choose your students, of course you will be successful."

(And not like there weren't amazing moments, students, and successes!  I would keep in contact with my students for years helping them navigate college.  I have had so many come up to me years later saying my class helped them succeed and choose their career.  I would take students out on weekends to explore Central Park, museums, to learn to eat at restaurants, etc.  But, over time I changed, teaching in some areas is sanctioned emotional abuse, and the bad outweighed the good.)"

Pedestrian plazas are kind of a death trap, especially in touristy areas because there are a lot of people who mindlessly cross the street without looking in the direction of oncoming traffic just because the crossing area is usually narrower.    I follow the rules of the road, I ride a bit slower than traffic, and stop at red lights. I haven't had an accident, but there were a lot of almosts mostly near plazas when I had the light and right of way.  Build a plaza in a wider area, but not on a narrow block."
nyc,3e2dhk,sensible_human,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"Really? I would think a pedestrian plaza is a lot safer than a traffic lane. Converting a traffic lane to public space helps to calm traffic. It can also show that streets can be used for more than just cars, so there could be greater potential for a bike lane as a result of changing the status quo.  Also, having more pedestrians is also a traffic calming measure. If people are blindly crossing the street, that's an indication that they feel safe on the street. Having more pedestrian activity, both on the sidewalk and in the street itself, forces drivers to be more attentive and watch out for other road users.   because the crossing area is usually narrower.   That's (part of) the goal! Shorter crossing distances = greater walkability.  Also, the street isn't that narrow. There's still room for a travel lane and a parking lane."
nyc,3e2dhk,TheBlowersDaughter23,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I like having less cars on NYC roads as much as the next sensible human, but I'd rather have pedestrians that at least pay a tiny bit of attention to the road they're crossing.

The new design still leaves plenty of space for cars. There's still a general traffic lane and a parking lane. But we need to start reclaiming streets for all modes of transportation, and that means more space for people walking.  We also need to move away from automobile dependence. Obviously, this location is one of the least automobile-dependent places in the US, and we might as well act like it. The area has enormous pedestrian traffic, so they are simply responding to people's needs. As we move into the future, we will need safer streets in all cities that provide a safe place for all road users, not just cars."

I'd like to again ask how this is a problem concerning NYC's homelessness, of 'huge proportions'.  Where LGBT rights and acceptance are pretty standard.  And most parents are quite liberal concerning such matters.  Especially considering the number of veterans (currently 12% of ALL homeless) DWARFS the total number of LGBT homeless.  Even by your numbers.    As for your other article.  Interestingly a single father with a female daughter would have just as much of a hard time finding shelter by the current rules.

Should we really be sleeping easier because the number is 60,000 and not 100,000? Is ""We're doing slightly better than during the great depression relatively speaking"" something to be proud of?"
nyc,3dzng3,nomad1987,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:00:22 2015 UTC,I would sleep easier if it is close to historic norm (correct me if it isn't) I am not sure why a comparison to the depression was needed apart from exaggeration. It is an unpopular opinion but it is unrealistic to have a system where you can house every homeless person
nyc,3dzng3,zakkkkkkkkkk,10,Tue Jul 21 02:39:31 2015 UTC,"Uh, it actually is practical to house every homeless person. Utah did it statewide, for starters."
nyc,3dzng3,nomad1987,3,Tue Jul 21 04:28:14 2015 UTC,"you think the number of homeless in Utah is the same as NYC?  I didn't say it was impossible, it is unrealistic given the # of homeless and the ridiculous amount of money it will cost. Plus the problem is if you do provide shelter to the current crop, then EVERY homeless person on the east coast will be moving to NYC. Utah is not as accessible.    I guess if there is proof we spent more on the homeless on treating them with ER visits and special attention paid by the police force, than finding them a place to stay (like they did in Utah), I am more than willing to change my mind!"
nyc,3dzng3,mutokangius,20,Tue Jul 21 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"Hey what's up. I used to work for a non profit emergency shelter and supportive housing facility in Seattle that caused some controversy a few years ago, because we were allowing addicts to live in some of our housing facilities and still use drugs (ie, we wouldn't terminate their lease if we caught them with illegal drugs, but you could still get kicked out for dealing drugs or other antisocial behavior).   Here is an article about it: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/Mobile/article.aspx?articleid=183666  This research found that our housing program was saving the city of Seattle about $4 million a year by housing about 90 residents. Most of that was because these people were chronic overutilizers of city services such as emergency responders, hospital visits, and jail/court time.  Also, as one client eloquently explained to me, ""when you're homeless and crashing in the streets, you have to drink more just to fall asleep. Then you only sleep a few hours anyway before some cop wakes you up, and so you start drinking again. When you have a home, if nothing else, you drink less by default just because at least you'll be getting eight hours of sleep where you're not drinking."" Having a home is one of the most important therapeutic strategies for helping people quit drugs (or deal with other mental illnesses; 80% of all homeless people are mentally ill or chemically dependent). I would go so far as to say that it's unreasonable to expect people to quit using drugs while they're still homeless."
nyc,3dzng3,hasn0life420,13,Tue Jul 21 05:30:48 2015 UTC,"Well, Salt Lake City spends about half the cost (IIRC. It's a heck of a lot less, anyway) on housing them than they were doing on ER visits and whatnot beforehand. Do you need me to cite that?  New edit: Of course I'll cite it.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/08/daily-show-homelessness_n_6437644.html  Now, Salt Lake City has a population just under 200,000. And they have just about 2,000 homeless people (which counts those who are now housed by this initiative, as near as I can tell). Which means that about 1% of the population is homeless. Somebody ran the numbers upthread, and in NYC we have slightly less homelessness per capita, at .7% of the population."

nyc,3dzng3,mynameismarkcarlos,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think percentage actually matters for something like this. That might, possibly (but I'm dubious), be useful for econometrics used for academic analysis, but it really has no bearing on the affected people themselves.  If the total number of homeless people has increased (regardless of percentage of total population), then there has been in increase in the number of distressed people in need of assistance. Homeless shelters don't care about percentages or proportions. They deal with people directly. If there are more people they have to deal with, there is more stress and demand on the shelters that are trying to help them."
nyc,3dzng3,Unicorn_Tickles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"so honest to god questions: how big of a jump was the homeless rate before the Great Depression and after the Great Depression?

If .50% of the population was homeless before the Great Depression and it jumped to .87% then that's huge, but expected since it's the Great Depression. But we don't really know what the spread is over the years here, so again, yeah, really fucking misleading."

If, say, NYC were to get 10x more populous, think about what NYC would look like if there were also 10x more homeless."
nyc,3dzng3,FluxxxCapacitard,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:58 2015 UTC,And even then I would assume this number is inflated due to NYC being somewhat of a homeless hub for the entire east coast
nyc,3dzng3,this-username,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:20 2015 UTC,"But do the homeless really travel to NYC to be homeless?  I always thought it was a home grown problem.  I mean, I doubt 100% of them were born and raised.  But I would genuinely question how many became homeless and then opted to migrate to NYC.  Seems like a tough city to be homeless.  I know out on the west coast the homeless tend to be a bit more migratory.  Never assumed the NYC homeless was as well."
nyc,3dzng3,omgpro,4,Tue Jul 21 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"check it out, the numbers are definitely going up:  The share of single adults who applied for shelter and listed their last address outside the city rose to 23 percent in December from 19.9 percent in February 2012, the Department of Homeless Services said.

This has continued under Cuomo, with the Governor attacking the city for problems he mostly created..

We quarantine TB patients against their will and force them to get treatment.   We can do the same thing for bipolar patients and schizophrenics. That population already makes up 40% the Rikers population.   Treating them - even if it is longterm hospitalization - is good for them and good for society.

It was proposed as a personal freedom issue, but really it was a way to not spend money on desperate humans.  The result was a lot of seriously crazy people living on the street  What is needed is a reversal of this process - if you're too crazy to even function, you should be taken care of.  We're the richest society in the world, we can afford not to have schizophrenic people wandering the streets in their own filth..."

If you need fast food to survive, I can reccomend a few fruit stands where you can get a day's worth of healthier food for half the price of a value meal.   That's really nice you pompous ass, but it's pretty well known that it is the bottom rung that are surviving on fast food, why don't you go show them.   If the economy isn't capable of paying people a living wage for full time labor while certain sectors of society are making more money than ever before then something is very broken with the economy.   Yes, so why do you want to punish small business because the economy is fucked.

I agree except for the last part - I see younger kids working fast food for the most part, although I'm not frequenting them that often. But the idea that, ""Well, it's not just kids working there"" doesn't retort my original argument - of course there are people working there trying to support themselves or their families, but that these jobs just aren't meant for that. If we force fast-food companies to give low-level no-skill jobs a wage high enough to support a family, then where does it stop?   However, by having them pay so low, we are effectively giving handouts to McDonalds by subidizing the bulk of their labor.   Like I said, this will alleviate the symptom, not the disease.

Look at the reasoning behind Henry Ford's doubling of factory wages.  You don't have a healthy society when there is a large underclass working for nothing wages, as your selfish logic behind paying fast food employees nothing implies.  I would rather everyone be paid fairly and at a living wage, even if that brings my costs up, because a society in which everyone is on an equal footing is better, and we also have a lot less control over where we end up in society than we naively assume we do.

And fast food minimum wages will never be high enough to actually cause brain drain.  You're acting as if it's going up to $100/hour, when it's really only going up to $15/hour, which is a $31K/year salary if you work full time.  That's only going to ""drain"" talent away from similarly horribly paying professions.  In an ideal world the minimum wage would increase in lockstep across all industries.  That isn't happening fast enough to ameliorate growing wealth inequality, so the second best alternative is that each industry's lower rung workers should organize and do as best as possible for themselves.

Nowadays, you work as a shipping clerk for $12 an hour, and your manager said that, if you put a year or two in, and keep your nose clean, you can go up to $14 an hour. It isn't a lot of money in NYC, but you stay with your Aunt in a rent stabilized place, and you make it work. Heck, you even are doing better than some people you know.  You like the ladies, but have sort of uneven luck with them. Most of them don't seem too impressed with your job. Some of them have even left you and ended up with men (and one women) who make a bit more than you. You struggle to take the ladies out on fancy (or even fancy-ish) dates. But hey, you do better than some.   Now along comes this proposal that will increase fast food wages above your hopes and dreams. Suddenly you realize that there will be no one below you, you've been forced down to the bottom. It seems like there is no one below you, and truthfully things already hadn't been great. God only knows what the ladies will think now, they were barely paying attention before.   So do you support the bottom leapfrogging you? Hell, no! Unlike all the other news that you read, about death in the Sudan, this looks like it is going to be screwing you, personally, over, for the entirety of the future, and there are basically no benefits for you personally. You have no fast food experience, you are at a disadvantage for those jobs. Also it isn't like the fast food people worked for this, they just were given this.

nyc,3dyktl,hambeastthrowaway,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"As /u/yasth pointed out, it's a networking effect. Throwing more money at poor schools doesn't solve the problem because the kids don't get the advantage of networking with affluent families. If you send the poor kids to wealthier schools, by virtue of interacting with other kids, they will become familiar with families that are bankers, lawyers, and doctors. This can be profound for some students who only know adults who work as janitors or other blue collar work and haven't had the benefit of a college education. Having a mixed socioeconomic population of students is more effective than simply throwing money at the problem.   More importantly, socioeconomic status is not a protected class which means that affirmative action based on socioeconomic status is only subject to rational basis review by the courts. It also, in effect, benefits minorities more since they are more likely to be in a lower socioeconomic position. Put simply, having a kid whose parents make $30k/year over a kid whose parents make $150k/year with all things equal get into a college is much more preferable means of affirmative action than simply by race or ethnicity."
nyc,3dyktl,acaraballo21,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:59 2015 UTC,"That's not how network externalities work. In order for network externalities to work, the originating source needs to hold significant influence (usually by outnumbering) over the others.   A classic example of network externalities is the adoption of Gold Standard in the late-19th century, a trend set off by the British Empire. To promote economic stability and growth, the British Empire decided to adopt Gold Standard for its currency. With approximately 25% or 1/4 of the world's territory and 1/5 of global population, the British had significant influence in international trades, and every world power had exposure to the British Sterling. When the overwhelmingly powerful British decided to go Gold Standard, an increasing number of countries followed the suit and the trend accelerated until virtually everyone adopted it by the turn of the century.  As shown in this example, network externalities work when the originating source is more powerful than other members of the group. If you inject 20 high-performing students into an under-performing school of 200 students, it's not those 200 students who will be influenced; it's the 20 high-performing students who will be influenced, i.e. a drop in their performance. Considering there are more under-performing students than above-standard students in the NYC Public School system, network externalities will only bring down performance of currently high-performing students, thereby further deteriorating the system."

I did it for three years and could not be more excited to start my new job in the suburbs, at a school with lab space and equipment and kids that won't throw shoes at me. Mine is not an uncommon trajectory, pay your dues in the rough schools, do the best you can with what's available, and get out as soon as a better school will hit you.   My question is, how do you get teachers trained for what they will actually be working with? I went through a respected undergrad teaching program. I was woefully unprepared for my first job. So we need to stop training teachers for the job they want and start training them for the job that's needed. Otherwise it'll continue this cycle of teachers leaving urban schools without ever getting good at that job.   I can imagine staying at that urban school if I had better support. My co workers were great, my principals were great, even some of the kids were okay.

We need to start viewing participation in social programs of welfare as opportunities to really intervene in the cycle of poverty.   This means that we should be directing EXTRA resources to these schools!    The problem is in the home.  The bottom line is that from the ages of 0-somewhere around 18, children are inherently less intelligent and less informed than almost everyone older than them.   In fact, as a 20 something, I'd say the vast majority of us are simply more impulsive and frankly dumber and certainly less experienced than the average 50 year old.  There's no way around this.  It's just a fact of learning taking time, and largely during childhood, being dependent on a parent for everything.  If generation after generation of children turn out to be shitty adults, it's because generation after generation of parents were not corrected.  Most societies don't need correction, some sub societies do, and regardless of race, it's generally those who have been excluded from a larger, broader and more successful society.  Generational poverty exists in white rural areas, too, for exactly the same reasons it exists in urban black/latino ones.  It's just not a race thing; it's a societal inaction thing, and we need to stop pussyfooting around it."

Kids who pick up on the material learn by teaching it to their classmates and poorer kids are exposed to pathways to success they might not have realized existed before.   Politically, poor people benefit from attending schools with wealthier parents who have the ability to petition the DOE to make sure their schools get enough funding and can raise money via the PTA that is just not possible to do with poorer schools.

So, we can bus poor kids into affluent neighborhoods.  Those kids will definitely get a leg up.  But how do we diversify poor neighborhood schools?  Do we say ""Well, you have your 50% of white students, the rest will have to go to the poorer school in the next zone over""?.  Do you think that rich parents are going to accept that?  They're going to pull their kids and put them in private schools.  So now we have some lucky poor kids in more affluent zones, and some unlucky kids from those affluent zones (but who's parents can't afford to send them to private, and the kids didn't test into one of the public programs) sent to poorer zone schools.

For the median to be so far off from the mean implies that there are some large outliers (if I remember my statistics class correctly).  So, yes.  You're right, there is a correlation between the race of a neighborhood and income levels (there's also a correlation between household and neighborhood income levels), meaning that Black and Hispanics are doubly screwed because bringing up their household income level doesn't increase their neighborhood's income level as much as it does for Whites/Asians.  However, I don't think you addressed my main issue: Simply busing kids around based on race isn't going to actually fix the problem.  Some lucky minorities will end up in better zone schools, and some unlucky whites (And maybe Asians?) will end up in worse zone schools because all the rich whites/Asians that get shipped to the poorer zone schools will buy their way out.

nyc,3dyktl,BFH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"While it is a noble gesture to fund education equally, there are some major problems with this.  1) Many towns have their property values based, at least partially, on good schools. In Long Island, for example, the towns of Great Neck and Garden City are known for their excellent school systems. If funding was taken away from those schools and sent to schools in East New York, say, property values would go down substantially in those towns.  2) Following argument #1, assuming that all funding is equal between NYS school districts, those families with means would simply pull their children out of the now-underfunded public schools and put them in private schools. It would cause a mass-exodus of students from middle and upper class backgrounds from public schools, leaving only the poor to use the public schools. And since only the poor would be using public schools, those with means (and political clout) would then cut funding from them to lower their taxes.  I understand that equality is the goal, but you must realize that most parents put their child's education as their #1 priority, above all else. Those with means just have more power to do something about it."
nyc,3dyktl,pfthrowaway21315,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:06 2015 UTC,"Decoupling school funding from local property tax doesn't automatically make local schools that are succeeding fail, just as it doesn't automatically rescue failing schools. The rich schools would have to try a bit harder, but would still have an enormous advantage. Poorer schools would still face huge challenges but would be somewhat less handicapped. Property values would not plummet in rich neighborhoods, and might go up in poorer neighborhoods.  Bussing kids from other neighborhoods doesn't automatically bring the quality of the rich schools down either, but it allows the inequity built into the system to give poor kids a shot at a good education. However, I'm not sure about how successful it would be to bus kids from good school districts into bad ones without making other changes to improve bad schools. I think we need to equalize school funding, provide after-school programs, and create incentives for parental involvement (tax credits, classes, etc.)  Remember, though, that parents taking their kids out of public school still have to pay into the system, as they well should."
nyc,3dyktl,BFH,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"This is just ignorant of the problem. Instead of complaining about ""poor"" kids being mixed with your kids, why not get involved with the school and make sure that these kids have a good role model?   It's a networking effect. Throwing more money at poor schools doesn't solve the problem because the kids don't get the advantage of networking with affluent families. If you send the poor kids to wealthier schools, by virtue of interacting with other kids, they will become familiar with families that are bankers, lawyers, and doctors. This can be profound for some students who only know adults who work as janitors or other blue collar work and haven't had the benefit of a college education. Having a mixed socioeconomic population of students is more effective than simply throwing money at the problem. It's much easier to get into college if your best friends dad is an alumni there and can write you a letter of recommendation than not knowing anyone who went to college.   By having the attitude that you do, it makes the situation all that much worse. White families have historically always pulled their kids out of public schools to avoid having their kids attend school with other minorities being brought in. It's tinged with racism and xenophobia. What ends up happening is white flight that leaves the schools with even less resources. What do you think happens when a kid goes to a school and all his classmates have parents that are well off professionals versus a school where the parents are all in jail for selling drugs or in poverty?

And Uber (and other apps like Lyft, Via, Gett, etc.) would be screwed because they're in high growth phase, meaning more and more people are coming onto the platform to use Uber, but the number of cars will remain relatively constant. Demand is rising faster than supply, so longer wait times/higher prices will impede their ability to compete fairly.  These bills are simply anti-competition, anti-innovation and anti-consumer. The only people they help are the medallion owners.

Surely you understand the implications of the court finding one Uber driver to be an employee stands as precedent for the rest of the drivers as well? The six other states you refer to haven't recently came to any conclusions regarding Uber. I'm under the impression a challenge similar to the one in CA is working it's way through the NYS courts (and likely the other states as well), so no I absolutely do not agree with your suggestion that it's not a compelling argument. Actually - to anyone who is required to follow the law, the compelling argument is that Uber's hiring practices are illegal in California. Anyone investing in Uber would likely be aware of this thorny issue so as someone talking about investments and 'knowing so much about startup businesses' it couldn't be more ironic that you think there are no compelling cases to suggest Uber might actually have a problem.

They currently are in California seems to be what you missed. You also seem to be missing the fact that it's currently a debate as to what Uber's employees are. You seem to be unfamiliar with how these debates take place in society. So while yes, Uber is currently legally allowed to contract drivers in a number of states, this is definitely not a long-term nor short-term given.   Oh, and just a tip: don't call someone out for being uninformed, when you yourself have no idea wtf you're about!!!   Yeah - what is it that you think I'm uninformed about? Revenue? We aren't going over Uber's numbers here, this is a very off-hand conversation on a internet chat board so you might want to tone yourself down a notch, I was just using a very common turn of phrase for businesses in this context.

In doing so, they should also pick up the tab for any upgrades necessary. It shouldn't be up to the driver on the ground, it should be up to the company as a whole to comply."
nyc,3dzh4g,CallHimAR,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, what the TLC agrees to and what it actually does is a matter of the future. Based on the past, I'd bet anything they don't come close to that 50% figure and lobby to kick that target way down the road. Not a compelling argument.  Increased congestion is certainly a concern, and studies should be conducted (I'm sure Uber would foot the bill as they have many times in the past), but common sense suggests that services like Uber might actually decrease congestion, given carpooling and the fact that it dis-incentivizes personal car ownership.  It's clear that this legislation is merely a political move to stymie Uber/Lyft/Via/Gett's growth and given that De Blasio is heavily in pockets of the yellow cab industry, it'd be naive to think that it has nothing to do with it!  Your last point is a matter of personal belief. I don't think there's anything wrong with the fact that they're technically not hiring anyone and, like I said, I'm sure Uber (and their ilk) would agree to common sense regulation to address accessibility needs (and achieve whatever the agreement is by paying new drivers with WAV more, subsidize their upgrades, etc.). Not to mention (as I said above) that Uber has already done a great service by including a WAV option of UberT - without one, you just have to hope and pray that a WAV cab (A) drives by you, (B) isn't full and (C) actually picks you up.  And I'm not saying Uber shouldn't move on its position, just that they can come to an agreement without this legislation.  Also, I said anyone who fully supports De Blasio on this one, is blind - you have concerns, they're just not compelling enough to support this bill."
nyc,3dzh4g,saywhaaaat,0,Mon Jul 20 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"Well, as of right now, this is the claim. You can make whatever assumptions you like, but at least there is a plan in place to make this happen. Uber has no plan to increase accessibility amongst their vehicles, and in fact, is directing people to Green NYC Taxis via their app to make up for this lack of service.  Increased congestion due to an influx of for hire vehicles should be studied. However, it would be incredibly hard to study it while the fleet of for hire vehicles, Uber specifically, continues to grow as the study takes place. Hence part of the rational for the cap. Also, common sense suggests no such thing. There is no reason to believe that people will ditch their own cars in favor of Uber. Quite the contrary, Uber's main user base is young and tech savvy, aka the same people who don't drive in NYC.   You may claim that it's clear that this administration is in the pocket of the Taxi industry, but that is in no way a 100% certainty. Nor is it a 90% certainty. In fact, you can't really say anything regarding the Taxi industry's impact on the Mayor. Only that they contributed around 2% of his total amount raised for his campaign.  The last point is not personal belief. That is the standard that has been set. If Uber is going to put people to work, they need to provide benefits. Otherwise, these people are not employees, they're simply people earning a secondary revenue stream."
nyc,3dzh4g,CallHimAR,0,Mon Jul 20 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"Your right there is a ""claim"" and a ""plan"" but, again, based on the past - good luck with that! (As an aside, have you ever heard the phrase: ""insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different result""?) And remember, (after initially supporting them) De Blasio didn't even want the green cabs!!  What I'm saying is that they could work with Uber to create a similar plan without stymieing their growth. You think this legislation is the only way to solve this problem?  There is also a wealth of data already available to see how Uber and others have effected congestion. You think this legislation is the only way to solve this problem?  And you're right, I can't prove that De Blasio is in the pockets of the Taxi industry. Just like I can't prove money has any influence on any politician who hasn't gone to jail for corruption. Only that the taxi industry is one of his biggest donors (I got 5%, not that 2% is anything to sneeze at). And come on, man, I refuse to believe you're naive enough to completely believe De Blasio hasn't been influenced by them - at least a little.  At the end of the day, though, my point is that this legislation is not the answer to your and the mayors concerns. Is there really no other way that doesn't have me and a lot of other people feeling this is all political bullshit?"

So maybe you should read what I wrote at one point or another rather than just outright dismissing me out of hand because you (and others) can[t make a compelling argument.   What compelling argument have you ever made? All you've done is suggest that surely there must be possible alternatives in each situation, as if Uber not being able to add more cars over a few months is like some sort of actual crime against humanity. Or that there are actual solutions to what you question is possible or not. So that's far from a compelling argument. In fact - it's debatable whether that is even an argument or just a general question as to whether or not it is even possible to make such an argument on your behalf.   And frankly, I'd brush up on the word compelling if I were you as you don't seem to understand what it means given that you think there is no compelling reason to follow the law!  You seem to be especially confused because I never even bothered to suggest that was DeBlasio suggested made sense. I've only bothered to take you up on your arguments about Uber's hiring practices, it's general legality, and what is required of a person to disagree with you (hint, it's not actually being a member of the TLC). You seem to suggest many things that are actually quite far from the truth and it would not be fair to this subreddit for such misinformation to go unchallenged."

This industry is evolving so rapidly, with the number of vehicles skyrocketing even as the pool of New Yorkers who can afford to pay $10 or $20 to take a car trip is far more limited.   Here's the issue of discrimination against those who live in non-Manhattan boroughs.   There's a point at which more and more drivers will find themselves fighting over the same group of riders — something we see already with 72% of pick-ups made by high-growth companies like Uber taking place in the heavily congested Manhattan core.   Here's the issue of affordability again.   Riders deserve honest rates and security against surge-pricing schemes that look an awful lot like price-gouging.   The study addresses each of those in L.A., showing its methodology so it can be implemented in other cities. It doesn't address congestion or environmental concerns or even protection for Uber's workers, but that isn't the whole of de Blasio's rationale for regulating Uber either."

My wife's family moved to Florida when she was a teenager from New York and they were a little shocked by how powerful a average lightening storm can get. Her kid brother would hide under the bed.   Hurricanes are kind of like Blizzards now. I don't really want them but the way the news hypes them up I do get a little disappointed when they curve off and go somewhere else.

The Jets are seen as second class because they are from the AFL.  The Nets are seen as second class because they are in New Jersey, er, because they are from the ABA.

It's very interesting to see the variety of people in the Garment District: businessmen, fashion interns, factory workers, junkies hanging out, junkies taking dumps in public and what I can only assume are groups of people who have nothing else to do, hanging out during the day because they either don't have class during the summer or don't have jobs.

I ended up in a room with 30-40 other people being addressed by a scout about how one cannot make it in modeling without a good ""photo book"". This was followed by each person going into an office for a 5 minute private consultation, which consisted of 2 minutes of more compliments, followed by 3 minutes of trying to get us to pay at least $600 dollars for a photo book.

nyc,3dwi7r,__DocHopper__,0,Mon Jul 20 15:15:03 2015 UTC,"Woah, I wasn't expecting the name calling. Although there are brothels and massage parlors all throughout the city, there is a concentration of them near the main transportation hubs, especially the garment district between Penn Station and Port Authority. I was being redundant, but by massage parlor I really meant a place that gives happy endings (ie. a brothel). But you're right in that massage parlors (or even prostitution) by itself doesn't necessarily make it a bad place. I was calling the place ""the worst"" in terms of it being a place that has a lot of vice, in the traditional sense of the term vice. And yes, one can do drugs and meet an independent escort anywhere in the city, but a perusal of backpage or craigslist for drugs or sex will reveal that the garment district is heavily represented.  As for the theft, I was on the east side of 8th avenue, the theft occurred on the west side. I would have gotten hit by a car if I had ran after the dude, and, in any case, he was already turning around the block (at 33rd st, north of the post office) before I could react. I didn't mean to make it seem like I was blaming the crowd for not stopping him. It was a weird situation where the people with the best view of the theft as it unfolded were on the opposite side of the street crime, whereas the people in the crowd in the best position to stop the thief had poor visibility and didn't realize what was going on until after the thief passed them. I eventually did see someone run after the thief (about a block behind him), but I don't know if he caught him."

nyc,3dstw0,falconPancho,3,Mon Jul 20 00:42:35 2015 UTC,That sounds great. A free lunch bag and a garbage bag with your can of soda. I always though it was weird why people buy garbage bags when you get them for free when you buy thw stuff. The ones you buy are so much worse because per volume of space the bag can contain they use much thicker mil plastic. Also the ikea bags and the reusable shopping bags are even worse because most people forget them and wind up buying more bags that are even worse for the environment. Plus they make them in such a way that people don't recycle them since they are treated like cloth bags.
nyc,3dstw0,ACeilingFanHolder,11,Sun Jul 19 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting this information about the volume/plastic ratio? It seems plausible if you're talking about contractor bags, perhaps, but this ignores the added value of using thicker plastic:   1) It is less likely to tear, and thus less likely to lead to street litter.  2) It offers a degree of rodent protection. Which also leads to less street litter, but also fewer rodents.  At any rate, the real problems with these bags are economic, and will become visible in the next decade as NYC switches over its residential trash collection model to a pay-to-throw system. The problem is exactly as you specified: people already have free bags in which to dispose of their trash. For the city to effectively institute a system, there is likely to be a new tax on trash bags. You can be certain they have an interest in making sure you buy bags that carry this tax."

A lot of that can be recycled, but not these bags. 1-2% of the waste stream is made up of these bags alone.

nyc,3dstw0,Darrkman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:10:31 2015 UTC,Okay let's be real with each other for a minute. You premise is based on the fact that people are getting these bags all the time when they're buying a soda. That everyone is going to accept a paper bag and plastic shopping bag when they're buying a soda. Instead of the real world where people actually say no bag. So now after you going on your diatribe about this we all know really what happens is people don't accept a paper and plastic bag for one soda. That's why I'm saying it's a non-issue. Because only a damn idiot would say OK to a paper bag and plastic bag for one can of soda. So basically what you're doing is you're complaining about something when it's not really an issue. Now if you want to use this as a platform for your personal little issue with trash feel free but don't be shocked when people tell you no one really cares.  Edit: you kind of remind me of the people at PETA.  They would actually walk past a homeless person to complain about cruelty of killing rats in the subway.
nyc,3dstw0,ACeilingFanHolder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"The point is nobody says ""okay"" because nobody asks. This is an opt-out service. And it's more than just in bodegas for sodas. It's rampant in practically every retail industry.   I gave you real-world numbers just now, so I don't understand why you're saying I'm living in a fantasy. Deal with them, or quit running your mouth about it. For more info, do a cursory search for the term: NYC waste characterization study.  And I don't understand why one issue has to preclude other issues. You have no idea what kind of work I do professionally or personally, in regard to either issue. I'm not the one advocating that we should ignore a real issue here. That's not what I'm saying at all. Every comment I have made says that one issue need not preclude another.

Uber's been a company for five years and it's revolutionized transportation, but yeah, let's burn it down because it doesn't perfectly serve every possible constituency, which is, according to /user/deebasr not even true."

If there aren't enough WAVs, another company should step up to serve the market, or the state should fill in the gap if its a societal need.  Shouldn't say Uber has to do it or be shut down. I understand the disabled need access to transport, but I think that's a public job if private industry doesn't want to do it.

The reality is that NYC already addressed a lot of the problems that exist with Uber in other cities by requiring Uber drivers to have TLC licenses.   The new regulations being proposed have nothing to do with protecting passengers or drivers or reducing congestion, they are about protecting the investments and business model of the yellow cab companies that gave over half a million dollars to De Blasio's campaign (http://nypost.com/2014/05/17/taxi-industry-gave-de-blasio-over-550000-for-campaign/)"

Also taxi's are major users of the city's infrastructure, I see no moral dilemma in taxing a ride to give a little back for infrastructure."
nyc,3dte96,thecat12,28,Sun Jul 19 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"all his points are retarded:  if the number of yellow cab riders is down because people are taking uber...here is a novel idea, cut back on number of yellow cabs you have on the streets(or send them to Brooklyn/Queens where they'd actually do some good)  if a rider doesn't want to pay surge pricing they can just take the cab or the subway. I'd rather have the option of uber available at higher prices, than having to wait 1.5 hours again in the middle of manhattan because it was the shift change for the cabs. And hell, you get a quote before you ride so you know if surge pricing is in effect. If I'm at a party and going home and see that there is a surge, I just get another drink and wait 30 minutes.  disabilities? there are plenty of options for people like that. why should every business go out of their way to accommodate them? If you are wheelchair bound and are calling up a car, how about instead of an uber, you call up one of the specialty services instead?  the MTA tax on ubers I wouldn't really mind. 50 cents is nothing in NYC and if you are taking an uber, you are already not that price conscious  as far as traffic, I find it's never the cars that are the issue, but the buses and trucks. How about doing some urban planning, and designating bus/truck streets so they don't clog up the rest of the city. Any time there is a truck on the west side highway, you can see the traffic slow down as anyone behind him tries to pass."
nyc,3dte96,wardser,7,Sun Jul 19 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"Just to respond to some of your points:  Yes, you may get an initial quote, but there are times (I've personally found more often than not) when the quote given is incredibly far off from what is actually charged.   Quite frankly, nearly every company has to go out of their way to accommodate people with disabilities. This is nothing new, and if is Federal law. Equal access to services for those with disabilities is incredibly important, and to say ""well they can just take something else"" is minimizing their transportation struggles."

Yes they do, but my point is that there are options. And transportation is the one factor where you don't see it applied that much. That said, Uber is like the only company that can actually accommodate this fairly easily. All they have to do is have a few dozen handicapable vans on the road, and the handicapped people can just set in their profile to always get a car with a lift.

Uber takes that out of the equation, grows substantially, and the city suddenly wants to ""protect the labor market""?  The fact is that many Uber drivers are not full time and can do it as a flexible side job solely because they don't need to pay upfront for medallion usage. They pick their own hours, use their own cars, and can leave the Uber system whenever they want. These are all win-wins to me, and it's hard to see how Uber could extensively fuck over their drivers especially when the barriers to entry and exit are so low. Anyone can drive a car."

Start by getting rid of the medallion system and if Yellow and Green cabs can't compete then fuck'em. They market will figure itself out. Obviously make sure minimum regulations (labor laws, discrimination laws etc) are being met but let the market do it's damn job. The only people these regulations are protecting are people who feel they need to drive their car everywhere.  Also, I have a sneaking suspicion Jersey has a lot to blame for this as well. Jersey transit is absurdly expensive and parking at Jersey transit is equally ridiculous. If they had any inkling of actual infrastructure obligation there, people could park at a local train stop for minimal price and take a fair priced train into NY. Then they probably would feel less obligated to drive. I'm under the impression Metro North is reasonable and I have no idea about LIRR."
nyc,3dte96,Whitegook,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is.. the uber drivers are all ""independent contractors"", not employees.

Otherwise I agree. Let the market solve it. I am worried that in the platform economy the barriers to entry may be too high, such that competing platforms will not arise.

I know that is hard for many to understand for a variety of reasons, some of which aren't anyone's fault.

nyc,3dq4ob,CercleRouge,0,Sat Jul 18 18:39:48 2015 UTC,A fair rent is the rent that the owner of the property wishes to charge. Only in NYC do people feel entitled to tell others what they should get for their own property. Living in NYC is a choice not a right.

If some apartments are controlled from decades ago and families keep handing them down through 'relatives' for decades, that's hardly fair, is it? The number of rent controlled apartments should be decreasing naturally as the [edit: original leaseholders] pass away and since they do not own the property the family has no right to a ridiculously low rent that they can then sublet for profit. And for old folks, there is already a rent freeze they can apply for anyways....Rent stabilization, though, is a whole other ballgame entirely...  Rent stabilization allows paying, working humans the right to live in a city without being arbitrarily kicked out every time the LL finds another sucker they can overcharge. It protects against price gouging just the same as grocery store owners could not all get together and decide to charge $1000 for baby formula, or laundry detergent or other essentials, just because someone else can pay that.  LL get tax breaks for both programs I believe.  The real elephant in the room is the absurd prices they can get for welfare tenants when charging ""market rate"".

Rent stabilization would apply to an apartment building built before 1967 renting a two bedroom in crown heights for $2000/month.  It's not a poor person living there as the landlord will want the family making at least 80,000/year to move in.  Median household income in NYC is around $50,000.  If you took away rent stabilization that family will be priced out of the five boroughs and will be commuting to work from Yonkers or Hempstead, which would also see increased pricing as more families move out of the city and more upper middle class and wealthy move in.  It would be a windfall for landlords, a great place to live for young hipsters with daddy footing the bill, and a tragedy for everyone else."

And who is the 'everyone else' who is paying higher rents to support the middle income tenants? Rent stabilization effects the working and middle class taxpayers of NYC, the backbone of the city like it or not. And believe me we get shafted in every possible way on our NY and NYC taxes to hold up a large population of nonworking people, from generations of welfare families to hipster 'artists' who come here to get on food stamps cause they refuse to actually work for a living.  Once again, RENT CONTROL is different from STABILIZATION or subsided welfare housing  My personal issue is the welfare tenants in 80-20 buildings, LL get tax breaks to house what are often disruptive, loud, nonworking families and they refuse tto kick them out when they become a nuisance to neighbors because they serve a purpose: cause other tenants to leave so they can 'rennovate', (i.e., paint and fake receipts) and register a higher rate to charge the next tenant an increase."
nyc,3dq4ob,SaraToninTheMolecule,6,Sat Jul 18 17:40:21 2015 UTC,I think the confusion is also that somehow people from outside the city think that 'stabilization' means subsidized housing aka NYCHA/welfare/housing projects. It does not. Stabilization only means that you can't have an increase over a certain % when you are renewing your lease in a building that has tax breaks for being stabilized. It also does not apply if the rent is over $2000 I think to begin with.

Specifically in Bklyn there was a formerly notorious neighborhood where groups bought up property and then years later stocked the area specifically with certain groups of people. I remember CL ads of the time specifically catered to transplant artists ""be part of the vibrant upcoming art scene"" ""we love artists and musicians"" etc. I saw out my window brokers handpicking clients: we would joke about who he was going to go to meet and whose cell phone ring he would ignore, based on the looks of the person getting out of the car...it's the whole little game the LL and the city plays, and the LL try to get around whatever rules are in place.

nyc,3dq4ob,SaraToninTheMolecule,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you keep bringing up rent control when the article is about stabilization. No one is talking about rent control except you. Stabilized apartments are on the decline because of several loopholes that allow landlords to deregulate the apartment, namely once the stabilized rent reaches 2,500 the apartment is no longer subject to stabilization. Thus, landlord are incentivized to kick tenants out because every time a new tenant moves in they are allowed to raise the rent several hundred dollars and get that much closer to the 2500 threshold.  Also it's somewhat strange that you think it is unfair for families to pass down rent control apartments to each other, while at the same time landlords are able to pass down the property to whoever they want. Why is that fair? Seems like quite a double standard."
nyc,3dq4ob,jarsnazzy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"Oh I am bringing up rent control for two reasons. One I do not believe the map is only stabilized apartment changes. Two is that when discussing in person, on social sites, reading the comments section and following the issue over the past years I notice that many of my neighbors do not know the difference. I myself thought my apt was under control until I went to the meeting the year of the 4% increase. Every year the board meets to decide the % for raising stabilized rent, there is an article in the local rag about some mythical $300 UWS rent control apt or someone scamming the system, it is intentional confusing of issues so that the average NYer get pissed and doesn't follow the issue. The NYT comment section are a veritable flash mob of amateur economics majors, republicans from outside the city who have a political agenda and feel the need to comment on every single issue and teh usual LL who are active in the movement...  [edit, referring to your comment LL are incentivized to kick tenants out to raise rent hundreds on move out from rent stabilized apt]: you are thinking of vacancy decontrol, LL cannot charge hundreds of dollars more every time a tenant moves out unless they do substantial renovation or the apt is vacant a year.  Re [second] paragraph: I said families in quotation marks. People hang onto a law that was passed years ago for a specific time and should rightly be faded out. People here have two apts that they sublet out to 'family', scamming the system. Also should you be allowed to keep a very low rate til the end of time, though generations and generations, (if there was actually family living there when the leaseholder passes away)? And wut?: ""LL are able to pass down the property to whoever they want why is that fair?"" They own the buildings. You are quite confused...and I am on the tenant side about stabilization anyways so why are we arguing  edit again: 'here' have 2 apts renting out making $ off control..meaning my building, not widely across the city. and I'm not saying I wouldn't do it too if I had the chance"

Technically illegal but since they never explicitly said that's why, it was pretty easy for them to do without me having a concrete way to prevent it from happening (yeah I could have taken them to court, but that was time and money and I only could have been awarded a 1 year lease by the judge, I did look into it with a lawyer).

People are renting apartments for whatever market might be and then turning them into businesses by renting them out on AirBnB.   The marked increase in unfamiliar faces, suitcases, cameras, and accents in buildings I find myself in is very noticeable over 5 years ago. There are stabilized tenants that refuse to let go and rent out their places for profits. Hell, I've seen someone AirBnB a housing project apartment.  I can understand renting a room out in your place to help with rent in a roommate change or pinch, doing it short term to not have to pay lease break fees, or maybe to help with bills during time spent out of town, but it has turned into a business for many and is squeezing an already tight rent market. This is also enticing landlords even more into pushing out rent stabilized tenants.  The system needs an overhaul and controls need to be put into place to prevent abuse.

Both food & housing subsidies have been the status quo since before we were even a fully modern economy.   His point is often overlooked by armchair 'free market' advocates. The  most wealthy society in history did it in the context of subsidized housing.   Making necesities affordable is a necessary function of society.

However, the fact that paying profits to a landowner simply for owning the land remains an inefficient distribution of capital and highly unfair. Even with less bureaucracy, land will remain for the most part in the hands of few already rich people that will pass it on to their heirs.

The fact that the cost of entry in the market is so high makes it easy to get a good margin of profit if you wish to do so."
nyc,3dq4ob,helios_the_powerful,-4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:29 2015 UTC,No the way to do it is for the city to build huge developments (like stuy town) all over the place and require that those units be owner occupied. Encourage a culture of ownership for the middle class instead of being renters subject to constantly increasing rents.
nyc,3dq4ob,ctindel,5,Sat Jul 18 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Lol, that sounds awful.  You'd be requiring people to gather a down payment, which immediately excludes the proverbial ""underclass"".  Additionally, the goal of ""[encouraging] a culture of ownership"" can be achieved by providing government incentive for the development of condominiums, over the development of leased units.   There's no reason for the government to get its hands dirty; literally only bad things can result from that. For example, if the government is directly paying for the development of land, now all of a sudden anyone who pays taxes feels like they have a say in how that land is developed.  Third point; finding a single plot of land to develop into a condominium complex is magnitudes easier than finding acres and acres of land (Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village is 80 acres according to Wikipedia).  Fourth point; the development of a single plot of land will deliver completed and available housing units to the market much quicker than even a 10 acre undertaking.  Tangential point; ""constantly increasing rents"" are the result of inflation, not the whims of landlords. Inflation has been approximately 2%-3% annually so if landlords don't periodically raise rent, in 10 years time they will find themselves taking in the equivalent of 20% less rent than they were taking in at the beginning of that 10 year period."
nyc,3dq4ob,tupac_is_still_alive,0,Sat Jul 18 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"That's fine, so start zoning land so that it can only be used for co-ops that are affordable by the middle class and require them to be owner occupied so that they're not snatched up by landlords.  There's no reason that the government can't get into the housing business if they wanted to. But the focus should be onl creating solid middle class communities because that's what drives the economic engine.  If you look at coop buildings that don't allow renters you don't see nearly the wild price appreciation that you see when foreign money comes in buying your property to use as rentals."

nyc,3dne4m,Druidshift,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"maybe people needed the ritual of watching TV news even though they recognized how shitty TV news became?   I think because they were unshitty sources of news is why they got so influential.  Most news is designed to excite one political base or the other.  While they could be guilty of that too....they really were some of the best newsmen on for a while, sad as that may be.  Honestly, the biggest thing about the Daily Show for me was the interviews.  Stewart had stars on, yes, but also people I wouldn't have heard about unless he had them on.    I like Colbert because I respect parody done well.  But other than that I am lukewarm on him, which is why I am wondering how I will feel when the parody is over."

Colbert is the 5th guy who does well (certainly he has a far better caliber of writers), but the rictus grin as he waits for your reaction just goes on a few seconds too long.  Stewart is a master of the gradual transition from tongue-in-cheek statements to snide remarks to breaking character and speaking plainly.  It's a good skills set, but he over-relies on it.  He moves from one end of the range to the other and back. No surprise laughs to be had."

nyc,3dodu4,Hankest,7,Fri Jul 17 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume this is a serious question.    Most people who are serious about camping do not stay at campgrounds where you set up a tent right next to your car and a few hundred yards from the campground's bathroom facilities.  Instead, they fill a backpack with necessities and head off into a wilderness area that allows camping, as you'd find in the Catskills or Adirondacks."
nyc,3dodu4,dpjoachim,3,Sat Jul 18 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"These spots look nice and relaxing....for people who want to be around lots of other individuals when they camp. However, I agree that serious campers would rather backpack into the wilderness and set up camp in a more uninhabited area. I always look for spots that have no sign of civilization (no sounds of cars, electrical wires, other campers etc.) and imagine that I'm viewing the world the same way  our great ancestors did."
nyc,3dodu4,BBnet3000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:26 2015 UTC,Plus if you're just walking there from the train you can carry more stuff and make it a lot more like car camping than if you were backpacking (where you need to be able to walk with your supplies all day). It's like going to the beach.

nyc,3dly3p,cobknob,43,Fri Jul 17 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"Throwaway because I've told this story in real life too many times:   I've done that before. In the middle of the Williamsburg bridge path, just at the peak, at 2 AM, and with no one else in sight, two guys with a dog had blocked the path. Since I was pedaling really hard, I didn't notice them until at about 150 feet away, they started waving their hands, shouting ""Stop! There's an emergency! You have to stop!""   Something clicked - these guys were not legit. Huffing and puffing up the bridge, and closing fast, I shouted back, ""What emergency?"" They just kept shouting ""You have to stop! There's an emergency!""  So I buckled down and gunned it straight at one of them. He braced up like he was going to try and grab me, but at the last second he jumped out of the way. As he wheeled around, he shouted ""Next time I'll sick the dog on you, bitch!"" This happened seven years ago, but that's the moment that still sticks in my brain. I froze (on my fast moving bike), since I just realized how close I'd been to stopping and whatever else happened after that.  Since I was flying, I just coasted down the bridge a ways, probably about 300-400 feet before getting my wits about me. I stopped and looked back. They were still there, still blocking the lane. So I called 911. The kicker? The dispatcher couldn't send any police since I couldn't give her an address."

I had no money, they took my leather jacket.  Another time, we started running and split up to different sides of the street. They split to follow us, my bf ran right into a cop car. They weren't expecting that (nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!) edit: guy on my ass turned tail and ran, we got to spend the next hour riding around in a cop car looking for the dude.

nyc,3dmgc6,jdb888,119,Fri Jul 17 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, the boom in six-figure salaries last year came from $431 million in retroactive pay, according to the Empire Center. This back pay put thousands of workers over the $100,000 mark, Lisberg said.  “When the MTA settled several outstanding labor contracts last year, tens of thousands of employees who had gone years without a raise received one-time-only payments for retroactive wage increases,” Lisberg said.   So there's your answer. Sounds like last year they made more than usual because they were payed money they were owed from previous years all at once.  What's the point of this article?"
nyc,3dmgc6,xlaxplaya,22,Fri Jul 17 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"You gotta pay what you owe, if that happens to be a lot of money, so be it.   As annoyed as I was to see MTA workers raking in money while service sucks I was diffused by the time I got to the bottom and read that it was a one time retroactive thing.   Now I wonder if it fucks with their taxes by bumping them into a higher bracket and being taxed more, or if they have to refile the previous years."
nyc,3dmgc6,doublen00b,3,Fri Jul 17 14:46:56 2015 UTC,"Most likely they'll pay for it when they do the 2015 taxes. Now if it was a significant increase, it might be prudent to make estimated tax payments (unless of course they had withholding for the back pay). Typically, tax payers are on a cash basis system (so you pay taxes on income received, not on receivables)."
nyc,3dmgc6,sri745,6,Fri Jul 17 16:51:32 2015 UTC,Probably taxed at a 'bonus' calculation which will tax the income at a rate that keeps them within their current bracket based on expected average salary or hourly rates.
nyc,3dmgc6,Buzzer-Beater,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"That's just for withholding. Come tax time, bonuses are the same as regular income."
nyc,3dmgc6,fdar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:23:17 2015 UTC,Of course but the additional withholding is happening for the reason you are talking about so when tax time does happen you already contributed that extra withholding rather than getting slapped in the face when you get ready to file.
nyc,3dmgc6,Buzzer-Beater,3,Sat Jul 18 17:29:28 2015 UTC,This article seems shady as fuck. It's concerning that you have to read all the way to the bottom to find out why the headline isn't as alarming as you might think.
nyc,3dmgc6,xlaxplaya,3,Fri Jul 17 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"It gets taxed as bonus which means at least 50% of that retro pay went straight back to the government to be reinvested in the MTA's capital plan.....oops, I mean back into Cuomo's back pocket."
nyc,3dmgc6,themonkeyaintnodope,5,Fri Jul 17 15:45:13 2015 UTC,"Bonuses are taxed as regular income. Withholdings are usually higher because they often push people into the next tax bracket, and no one likes owing the govt money come April 15th.   Any extra withholding is paid back as part of your tax refund.   I don't understand how people always seem to get this wrong."

The majority took the lesser option, because what we care about in this country isn't doing well, but doing better than our peers.

The photo in the article may suffer from foreshortening due to the perspective of the photographer and may be slightly misleading.
nyc,3do8ou,Ramses_L_Smuckles,8,Fri Jul 17 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"When I was there I found the rake of the top tier extremely steep. Not only are the stairs steep, but there's very limited walking space/leg room in front of the seats. It's pretty vertigo inducing (and I'm not prone to that at all), and I could easily imagine falling if you've had a few.  The only other arena I've been in that I would compare this to is at Rutgers University, but I think this is even steeper than that. It's practically hard to get to your seat at Barclays if there's other people already in the row. I'm not sure they had a choice though because of the extremely small footprint the arena is built on. Even the concourses are narrow as well to save space on the width between Atlantic and Flatbush."

nyc,3dmgwd,congerkromp,16,Fri Jul 17 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"That's a telecommunication handhole.  Telecommunication carriers (most commonly TWC) use these as termination/transfer points of fiber optics to coax/copper or to fiber again.    The grey stuff is 4"" PVC conduit which connects to telecommunications manhole.  Inside the conduit is 3 colored corrugated tubing called innerduct (the orange, black and green stuff).  Innerduct offers another layer of protection and makes pulling the cable safer and easier.  Inside of innderduct is a kevlar rope with a tension strength normally in the thousands of pounds since sometimes you need a truck to pull cable.  The black cable coming out of the innerducts is fiber optic cable.  Looks like a 144F (144 fibers) OSP (outside plant) freedom cable due to the tight bend after the innerduct.  Older OSP cable is a lot stiffer.  This might be a location for a ring cut (opening the cable and cutting only a handful of those 144 fibers but letting the rest continue on inside of an enclosure of some sort) since I don't see any ends of the cable, it just looks like a continuous coil in and out of the innerduct.  edit Freedom Cable and Innerduct and Handholes"

A union electrical contractor can charge between $350 and $500 (roughly) for a single outlet, and the outlet, box, wire etc costs less than $50 bucks. With a job like this, even if they donate the ""equipment"" the contractors installing it will still have to supply all the equipment to ""rough in"" the system. That's pipe, electrical junction boxes, wire, etc. Then whoever donates the equipment would supply it at the end and it would be tied in. Not to mention jobs like this don't usually go to the lowest bidder. And after rereading the article, the only equipment they say they will donate is the ""mobile WiFi device"" aka router.   Although I can't possibly imagine the electrical portion would cost more than $750k per building, and that is an already very heavy budget. Maybe 250k for all the telecom equipment. (The stuff you see in your stairwells and basement that all the cable lines come out of.) What I'm not sure about is what other fees would be associated with the project. Maybe the provider needs to upgrade their distribution system in the streets, or possibly the city is paying for x amount of years of service in their contract with the internet provider.   It's not entirely out of the norm but still probably has a lot of fluff in it.   Edit: completely forgot about the cost for the engineers and architects to draft the plans and design the job, although I have no clue what that would cost cause it's completely separate from the electrical estimating part.

nyc,3dlckg,Mmjdjmk,3,Fri Jul 17 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"Actually being convicted of a serious crime or  reporting too much income will fairly reliably get one evicted, eventually.   It does take a very long time, and the truth is often the criminal isn't the only permanent resident (or quite possibly listed at all), so the unit stays in possession (sometimes while fighting a lawn drawn out battle for staying in an ""over sized"" apartment) while the ""should be barred"" criminal stays living either officially ""temporarily"" or just completely unofficially.   As for income, it can be manipulated quite a bit, often much of the above applies (get a good job? become a ""temporary"" co-resident with your poorer family member, maybe even several different ones brought in a long line).  Anyways even with all that the NYCHA still processes hundreds of ""dispossessions"" a year. Of course they have many many more units, and the rate is much less than market rate housing. However, some/many of the ""earning out"" quits are probably resolved without evictions, and thus don't show up. More or less if a family, for whatever reason, can't hide the income enough there isn't much they can do, and little point in fighting it.  I'm not saying the system is perfect, far from it.

nyc,3dlckg,moxy801,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:54:01 2015 UTC,If rent control went away and the city unleashed the greed of developers you would see a huge increase in available housing for the middle class in the city. In both apartments for sale and rent. Right now rent control is creating a Manhattan filled with the extremely wealthy and the dirt poor.  Opening up of Staten Island during the 70s-80s to development made 80k two family and cheaper one family homes possible. Without those home owners (that use almost no social welfare services) the city would have no stable platform of revenue when bonuses from Wall Street fall flat. That development kept the city from falling into disaster. Those illegal (but clean and a lot bigger then other parts of the city) basement apartments also provide dirt cheap rent for hundreds of thousands of people in the city.
nyc,3dlckg,Statecensor,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:06:37 2015 UTC,It was when rent control laws were changed to favor LL's  in the 90's making it 10x easier for them to decontrol apartments that rents started going up so much.

It is however considered to be the progressive third rail. No matter how many times it is shown to improve the lives of residents. Progressives refuse to believe the facts that getting rid of it helps the middle class.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/the-perverse-effects-of-rent-regulation.html?_r=0  The problem, though, is that these programs actually make the city much less affordable for those unlucky enough not to live in a rent-regulated apartment, Mayer says. The absurdity of New York City’s housing market has become a standard part of many Econ 101 courses, because it is such a clear example of public policy that achieves the near opposite of its goals.  Over time its much better for the landlords for the rent controls to be slowly pulled apart by them instead of the city or state getting rid of the program. That is why they love it so much. Its much better then having around half of all apartments suddenly come back on to the market as free market apartments. That would cause as I said the value of the apartment buildings and rents to fall.  Apartment buildings in New York City are owned by two groups of people. Large companies and family run businesses that can afford to wait 30 years to slowly deregulate themselves and adjust the inventory to the current population."

nyc,3dj27n,untogethered,10,Thu Jul 16 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"That's basically the whole issue.   From a previous discussion I had on this topic and why the argument that Uber will add congestion is faulty at best.  ""If I am understanding you correctly you are saying that without a cap on the number of taxi drivers traffic in condensed cities would increase.  There are so many factors ignored with that conclusion that I felt compelled to reply.  First of all NYC is a place that few choose to drive in (specifically Manhattan) because not only is the traffic terrible, but parking is a nightmare. Therefore most people use taxis or subways or public transportation. By providing more of those options you are reducing the need for drivers to want to drive their own cars. Uber drivers increasing can result in personal drivers decreasing. Especially if they are offering a reasonably priced alternative.  Also take into account the market supply & demand factors. I think you touched on this briefly, but you seem to think that supply will exist because that's Uber's business model. That's ridiculous. Uber employees willingly choose to drive when they want to drive and it is all based on the driver to determine if he wants to try and pick up fares. Any driver who does this and doesn't receive a substantial return on their investment would quickly drop out of the market. It just makes no sense for them to continue working. Remember there are costs (gas, car maintenance, tolls) that these drivers incur so operating endlessly without reasonable return isn't possible nor likely. Even if Uber would like to have limitless supply, if there isn't enough incentive for the driver they can't fulfill that business model.  Also look at the market and how it is impacted by the consumer. If Uber can saturate the market with more cars, that provide better value for riders it would be more likely that competing companies would either have to lower their prices or drop out of the market. Yellow cabs/ green cabs are still in use today because they are readily available. However if Uber continues its expansion there will really be no need to use those cars unless you just enjoy paying more for the same thing.  If Uber and Ubers consumers were capable of shifting the market based on their consumer behavior this can also reduce the amount of drivers on the road. It could eliminate the yellow cabs that saturate Manhattan roadways now, and replace them with Uber cars. Once again providing a possible net-loss or non-net-gain. Just by allowing a market to be free doesn't mean it will be saturated. What usually happens is the profitable companies take over the majority of the business and the less profitable ones grab at the scraps. It's not possible for everyone to operate profitably under the model of ""more cars"" because the demand simply isn't there. I think traffic will most likely stay the same as it is now or maybe slightly increase (only because uber provides a cheaper alternative for those who might not have used taxi services before) but as I said above it's just as likely that those now willing to use Uber were those who drove previously. Overall I don't think the impact on traffic will be significant and it's a silly reason to want to limit free market competition.  Let the market dictate which drivers can operate profitably and those that can't won't be on the roads for long.""  Link to the rest of the discussion if you are so inclined."

If the yellow cabs had an app that allowed me to know when the fuck they were getting here I'd use it every time. They don't (or they haven't bothered to advertise it) so I use Uber out of convenience.  The support Uber gets has nothing to do with their business practices or the way the compensate (or don't) their drivers. It has everything to do with the fact that Uber has a better customer experience. If the yellow cabs provided people with a similar service Uber - and their business practices - wouldn't even be an issue.

The big yellow fleet owners, the ones who feared Bloomberg’s borough taxi plan would undermine their industry and contested it in court, gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to de Blasio’s campaign for mayor.  De Blasio, meanwhile, has consistently echoed the industry's objections to Bloomberg's reform of a livery system that had served them perfectly well, and did what he could to stop it before it became reality.  He filed an amicus brief in support of an industry suit challenging it. He spoke opaquely about the need to fix it. And, most recently, he installed one of his principal taxi-industry campaign fund-raisers as an assistant commissioner at the Taxi and Limousine Commission, where she’s supposed to help regulate the industry she solicited money from on de Blasio's behalf.  Joshi's announcement that the administration would halt the outer-borough plan, then, is perfectly consistent with his industry-proximate opposition on taxi reform, if not his progressive-populist governing agenda."

If you value the service as much as the price they ask for, use it.

So again, as I said above, if he had issued more Yellow medallions at the same time, you may have an argument. But it's also quite possible that he means what he says when it comes to congestion."
nyc,3dj27n,CallHimAR,10,Fri Jul 17 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"No, if he added more yellow medallions it would lower the value of the medallion. All of this, limiting the yellow medallions, halting the issuing of green medallions and going after Uber is to stop the yellow medallions from continuing to depreciate value.  Also all this traffic studies shit is nonsense. You certainly don't need to halt the growth of taxis for the DOT to conduct a study. More than likely, congestion is up because now we have all these bike and bus only lanes all over the place and Deblasio lowered to speed limit to 25mph."

Just last week medallion owners won a legal victory blocking Mayor Bloomberg’s plan to create a fleet of “green cabs” to serve New York’s outer boroughs, and last year medallion owners successfully stymied New York’s attempt to shift to hybrid taxis... Studies have even drawn a link between the medallion system and crummy cab service, which might seem far-fetched until you consider that drivers begin each 12-hour shift owing as much as $130 to their leasing company...Restricted supply makes for high medallion prices, and that in turn leads to consolidation in the industry"

Now if there is an increase in demand, it is possible that the number of drivers has increased since these new drivers want to capture the gains of the increased demand. Let the new number of drivers be D+d. Also, the number of fares would increase as demand has increased. So, let the new number of fares be F+f.

Also, if the price is the same in that area and I'm somewhere else why would I go there if I don't seek to gain anything? The number of people I cab back in forth in an hour is probably not gonna change super drastically it I stay where I am or move. If I move, they'll be more people wanting my services, but because there are more drivers there I'll get crowded out and probably end up taking around the same number of people if I had stayed in the area with less demand.

The reason why Uber and similar services are cheaper than cabs are precisely because they don't have a medallion system. For green and yellow cabs, they are force to purchase 'medallions' from the city for each additional cab they put on the road. These costs literally hundreds of thousands of dollars each. They did this to limit the number of cabs on the road. They wanted to limit the number of cabs on the road all based under a false pretense - more cabs makes more traffic. This may have been true in the 80s, but now that people are relatively comfortable taking subways and young people actively don't want to have a car, it's not true anymore. Sufficiently cheap and readily available cabs and car-shares displace cars on the road, not add to them. Take away the terrible medallion system and remove a shitwhack of overhead for cab companies."
nyc,3dj27n,Whitegook,0,Fri Jul 17 00:19:01 2015 UTC,"That's true, the medallion is outdated but I think there's still a problem. For example, drivers are typically given good incentives to drive for uber. Without those incentives, they really can't afford the low rates that are being charged to consumers. Lately, those incentives have been evaporating and that's putting drivers under a lot of pressure because the rates aren't being increased appropriately.   So the consumer still gets artificially low rates and uber still makes money. The driver gets screwed.   That's what I've been seeing from the news articles etc."

As far as driver's protection, I don't see why they deserve special protection and regulation beyond already existing labor laws. Why should cab drivers be guaranteed great salaries and not restaurant workers, movers, laborers, etc.? If they have enough market share and influence, they can form a Union like every other industry."

But without giving consumers good alternatives and by running taxi companies out of business, I think it's fairly obvious that the prices will go up higher than what it was with taxi companies.   Not an economist. Just a consumer who takes taxis all the time for work."

I have problems with the Obama Administration.  Mr. Obama's very reasonable use of vacation time is not one of those issues.  The appalling thing about the moronic Right Wing is that they never bring up actual issues - but bogosities like Mr. Obama's vacations, his birth certificate, or Benghazi.

nyc,3dm2qv,Phyrexian_Starengine,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:08 2015 UTC,I don't think you get the problem. The Hudson is dumping water through NYC into the sea. If you put up a coastal wall across the bay then the Hudson will keep filling up the NYC side of the coastal wall until it fills up. So you either need to pump all the water from the Hudson over the seawall or you need to build walls around the Hudson upriver to the point where it's above sea level (which sort of defeats the point of a sea wall). Blocking the Hudson river with a dam and flooding everything upriver even intermittently also sot of defeats the purpose.

nyc,3dip6j,glassroc1,7,Thu Jul 16 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"Because the primary determination of building size in New York zoning is the Floor Area Ratio (FAR). This is the ratio of the size of the plot to the floor area of the building.  So if a site in midtown has FAR of 20, that means that you could build an 20 story tower if you took up the entire plot (20 floors * 100% of the plot = 20 FAR). OR you could build an 80 store building if you took 1/4 of the plot (80 floors * 25% of the plot = 20 FAR). This is why older skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have so many setbacks.  So developers will assemble several small adjacent plots, and then build a very tall, very skinny building on one of them because you will make a hell of a lot more money selling a condo that takes up the entirety of the 100th floor than one that takes up half of the 50th floor.

A person who only travels on the trains a couple of times a week would put a certain amount of money on the card, say $27.25, with a $3 bonus, which ends up being 11 rides."

I'm carrying a few things and trying to get the new card in my wallet, and do something with the old one, as I can't bring myself to just throw it on the ground. While I'm doing that an entire school's worth of children (a school of children) walk out of the turnstyle in front of me.

nyc,3dfm2e,mangaguy,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"They used to not cost a dollar, so that isn't the reason for the implementation of MetroCard expiration dates. As said by others, you can also swap an expired card for a new one at the station. (The dollar charge was added to discourage the littering of MetroCards.)  I think the reason is still financial though. Unused MetroCard balances ""float"" in the system, and makes accounting difficult. Having a regular expiration period for the floating funds is theoretically good, as people won't hoard a million dollars on their MetroCards but will instead buy them regularly.   It does also provide the MTA more money, as unused funds that expire are usually not recovered (although it technically can be)."

What this city needs is more ""warnings"" for minor offenses and less summonses.   Say the cops catch someone riding their bike on the sidewalk. I have no problem with them stopping them and running their ID to check for open warrants, but if this is the first or second time they are stopped for this, let them off with a warning.

I think the idea is that the cops were not walking their talk here.  You're either allowed to hang out on a public bench by the mayors house or you aren't.    It's a sad state of affairs when everyone steps up to cops defense for not outright violating someone's civil rights - ""the cops didn't beat him!  what's the problem??""  There is still room for criticism here, for sure - they would probably not be hassling the guy had he not been homeless."

""pretty reasonable""? LOL. What fucking planet do we live on?   This is a disgrace. Let me quote you some of the article.   “You see that big house up there? That’s the mayor’s house,” the cop said.  “Here’s the thing: You try to panhandle in front of the mayor’s house, he’s going to have you moved.”  When asked if de Blasio would really do that, the cop answered, “Yeah, you’re going to be moved.”  “You’re in front of the mayor’s house. Think about it. How does it look, somebody panhandles in front of the mayor’s house? You see what I’m saying?”   I'm not really sure how ""get the fuck away from the mayor, you're embarrassing him"" from people who can take away your freedom with no regard for getting in trouble is goddamn scary.

If you really care about people pissing in the streets then spend the money to set up and maintain public restrooms, I don't piss on a tree if there's a restroom available.  I do it because I'm 45 minutes from home it's 2am, my bladder is about to pop, and there are no restrooms anywhere in sight for the duration of my journey.  1) Pissing isn't a huge deal in the first place, this city is filled with small and large animals pissing and shitting all over the place. A few humans adding to the mixture is not actually a problem. It'll all flow down into the sewers during the next rain.  2) Even if it is a huge deal you cannot possibly stop them and spending police officer time chasing down people taking a leak is and insane waste of time and money.  3) A much much more economical way to deal with the problem would be to install and maintain public restrooms. While it may be hard to fathom restrooms with full time bathroom attendants would be cheaper than attempting to end public urination by police intervention. And on top of that it would make New York a much nicer place.  TLDR: If New Yorkers really believe that public urination is a problem lets address the problem at its source (nowhere to piss). Rather than wasting taxpayer money at an ultimately pointless and ineffective police war on public urination."

I disagree, being able to get a cab on demand instead of having to hail for one (esp in the winter, and even more especially if youre not in an area cabs normally drive by) is great.  On top of that, I feel like you get a much more interesting cross section of people to talk to when you use uber.  You get former cab drivers, but you also get people that have completely different day jobs and do uber on the side.  It's really interesting.  You also don't have to worry about having cash, or paying at the end of the trip.  You arrive you say goodbye, get out and you're done."

Being unable to find a cab in the rain or at rush hour, or a cab that is willing to take you to Brooklyn, or pick you up in Queens is part of NYC too, and it sucks. Uber fixes all those things.   I did read that the # of uber drivers/cabs has surged 60% since 2011. So.. isn't regulation inevitable here?   Why does that make it inevitable? NYC a relatively low number of taxi medallions per capita. This is mostly just supply catching up with demand.

Meanwhile, in reality, contractors want financial stability and benefits and a more protected guarantee for hours against the capricious whim of customer demand. They want to be real employees!"
nyc,3ddlx1,teenagemurdermystery,17,Wed Jul 15 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"If you read the actual report from CA where uber lost the lawuit (http://uberlawsuit.com/Decision.pdf) you can see it's not about flexibility. Employee/contractor relationship is about the power balance that exists.  For example, requiring drivers to post uber signs, requiring drivers to respond in a certain amount of time, keep ratings above a certain level, requiring certain number of hours per week to be driven etc. When the power skews towards one party in any significant fashion they are an employer of an employee. Edit: simply saying 'you can quit/work anytime' does not balance out the power in the relationship.  I think the drivers would prefer to be employees because it would lighten their tax burden significantly, and uber doesn't want that because it would require them to seriously change the way they do business, from taxes and unemployment to the commissions they collect. Hell at that point they might as well even have a dress code."
nyc,3ddlx1,doublen00b,3,Wed Jul 15 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"Not all of them want to be employees.

Some of them do significantly better than what they would likely get.   People seem to think that they'd get paid like they were now, just with Uber picking up some taxes, that basically would be illegal though. They'd have to pivot to low wage drones with lots of command and control."

nyc,3ddlx1,Riverrun_past_eve,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:16:37 2015 UTC,I don't understand why what other companies do is of any consequence. Uber lets you know when you sign up what the terms are for you to make money from their service. If you don't like it go find a different way to make money. They let you work literally any time you want.
nyc,3ddlx1,Dracoplasm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"Because it affects the rest of the market. If Uber is more profitable for themselves and/or their drivers by classifying their drivers as contractors, there's an incentive for taxi companies to do the same thing, or go out of business (possibly by losing all drivers to Uber).  If we think there's some value in workers being classified as employees, enough to be law, the law needs to be enforced on everyone. It's not enough to have a single company that voluntarily follows the law. If we don't think it's valuable enough to legislate, then let's drop the law.  This is the same argument as with minimum wage, incidentally. Why does it matter if McDonald's wants to pay $5/hour, if there are other jobs on the market that pay more? Because then Burger King has no incentive to pay more than $5.01/hour, and those other jobs will stop existing.  (There's also some game-theory stuff going on here that means that it makes sense to legislate why everyone should do a thing, and that's better for all employers, even if individually it seems rational for each employer to not do a thing.)"

nyc,3ddlx1,424f42_424f42,16,Wed Jul 15 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"That's how Uber's business model works. That may or may not be how the law works. The IRS cares about this very much and has lots of guidance on this, because it matters quite a bit for tax purposes. Generally, if the business tells you how to do the work, that leans in favor of being an employee. You can't just reclassify all your employees as independent contractors (not that it stops employers from trying). Like other businesses, Uber would be paying a lot more if their drivers were regular employees.  The California Labor Commission, for instance, recently decided that Uber drivers were employees, which is why this is on people's minds now."

I'm hiring them because I have no idea how to paint. If I start a painting company, hire some freelancers to help me with the work, hand them some brushes, and tell them where to start painting and how, they're not freelancers any more, they're employees. If I file taxes like they're freelancers, the IRS will get mad at me."

nyc,3ddlx1,424f42_424f42,5,Wed Jul 15 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of factors in this determination; it's not a single question like ""does the employer tell you how to do your job"", although that's one of them. Take a look at the links I linked for more information, or at the California Labor Commission's ruling (PDF).  Uber drivers aren't obviously employees. But they're not obviously freelancers, either, because what Uber is doing is not well-established in caselaw. (A lot of the code here involves looking at what is common in the employer's industry.) They're betting that they're doing things by the law, and I'm sure they have smart lawyers who can defend that position. The CLC formally disagrees with them. The chairwoman of the NYC TLC agrees with them, for the moment, but will follow a court ruling in her jurisdiction.  There will probably be multiple court cases; the answer (like most things in employment law) isn't simple enough to fit in a Reddit comment."
nyc,3ddlx1,ldpreload,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"The California Labor Commission, for instance, recently decided that Uber drivers were employees   That one particular driver was an employee. It was a low ranking official's decision in a single case not some sweeping considered thing where the board decided to take out Uber. These rulings fairly frequently are over ruled."
nyc,3ddlx1,yasth,3,Thu Jul 16 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked at the decision fully, so this might be a dumb question, but is there some reason to believe that one particular Uber driver would be an employee and all the rest of them not? What did they do, reimburse her expenses? enforce her hours? and not to anyone else?  I agree that this is not a final ruling, and it's certainly not jurisdictionally binding in NYC, either way. All I am saying is that informed individuals whose job it is to make this determination find it reasonable to believe that Uber drivers may not be independent contractors. I don't think you could find a single California Labor Commission intern who would believe that, e.g., the average piano tuner is an employee of their clients instead of an independent contractor."
nyc,3ddlx1,ldpreload,2,Thu Jul 16 03:04:31 2015 UTC,"I mostly just wanted to clear up the scope of the ruling. You can't move to Cali and be an employed Uber driver (well you can be employed, but not for Uber as a driver).   There are a few weird things about the ruling, the driver's wages were looped through a third party LLC, no hourly recovery, etc. The basic logic would apply to all Uber drivers, but it leans very heavily on one particular test (is the business of the contractor the same general business as the contracting company), and truthfully if applied broadly would endanger a bunch of already existing contractor relationships (things like freelancing for a newspaper (or blog) would probably count as an employer relationship).    To put it another way this has a pretty good chance of being reversed. (Also it isn't the most interesting case, there is a current potential class action that has been being fought for years already, and has survived one big test (summary judgement) already. That is the one keeping Uber up at night)."

nyc,3ddlx1,BBnet3000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe they volunteer in whether or not they take a fair.  I mean I'm not sure how it would work if they became an employee of Uber and got all the benefits, and then took every other fair from a competing service.  Would they then be full time employees of two companies, with two sets of benefits?  The flexibility of working or not working is what would rid them of full time status, so once they became full time, they'd have to pick up fairs whether they liked it or not.  Add to that the difference from a regular taxi driver who cruises the streets looking for fairs.  That might count as work time.  With Uber, you get your fairs from the app, so you're not really scanning the streets, so you could be on your sofa, waiting for a call to come in while clocking in our 40 hours per week."
nyc,3ddlx1,motorboatnowork,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:34:23 2015 UTC,There are plenty of jobs where employees work part or flex time or on a per diem basis. It's perfectly plausible that Uber could set a time or fare-based minimum to be eligible for various tiers of benefits.

Actors and actresses who start fresh in LA, big city folks who start fresh in small towns, etc.  Getting back to the topic at hand, I definitely believe the facade should count as history. It was the original facade that was plastered onto Aaron Burr's former carriage house and destroying it is akin to throwing away art because that's exactly what it was. It's like destroying an outdoor museum.

The ESB was a marvel of its time for construction, engineering, and supply chain management to get the steel all the way from Pennsylvania into Manhattan as fast as they did.  I'm not saying they should be demolished and rebuilt RIGHT NOW, I'm just saying that at some point in the future we might want to tear them down and build something even better.  How can I tell what the future holds?

The character where people of different cultures and different financial backgrounds can coexist. By not preserving some of the character these landmarked districts share, we are willingly forgetting and overlooking the very ideals that made this city what it is in the first place--a diverse melting pot. No, we don't want to preserve poverty, but it would be nice if NYC could offer more opportunities to those who come from poverty to, at the very least, the middle class.  True, an arch isn't a big deal, but to commissions like the Landmarks Preservation Commission or organizations like the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, it is.  Large developments are no longer made for lower income families, thus the cost of living skyrockets and further pushes out those who would come to start anew due to the very fact that they have to start with a higher income limit than the average person in the USA. There are numerous posts in /r/nyc where developments that tout ""affordable housing"" show that there is a stigma toward lower income families on the income vs rent owed scale.   Lastly, we see the out with the old, in with the new attitude while walking down the street every day. Long-time, beloved businesses shut down due to high rent increases, mom and pop shops for the same reason...and they get either get replaced with just another chain that can afford the rent (drugstores, Starbucks, or banks are the biggest players!) or the storefronts remain empty until the landlord figures out that he/she probably has to lower the rent because they aren't getting anything from that. Sure, the newbies don't have a problem with that, unless some store like Mile End Deli or Dominique Ansel Bakery get pushed out to make way for an Olive Garden."

And yet at the same time there is still a fascination every time NYC builds a new skyscraper, whether it be 1 world trade or 432 park avenue or whatever.    I agree that new skyscrapers and structures may attract tourists and those who’d like to live here. But have you given thought that older, landmarked properties/districts may attract potential residents as well? The West Village is ripe with old and new residents alike, as are neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights, Forest Hills Gardens, and the SoHo Cast Iron District. Buildings like the Dakota are (almost) at full capacity because they have such a resonance in the city.   I mean its right there in the name, NEW York. A place for constant rebirth.   If you want to argue semantics, New York was originally called Fort Orange and then New Amsterdam and acted as a province/extension of the Dutch Republic. Finally the Dutch surrendered the colony to the British and was renamed New York after the Duke of York. New in this case was making it an extension of the countries that owned it prior to the Revolutionary war.   Imagine if we had prevented the pennsylvania railroad holding companies from buying up all that land and tearing down buildings so as to build pennsylvania station? Just like a company, if a city isn't growing it is dying. The only way for a landlocked city to grow is to demolish old things and build new ones.   I honestly can’t argue with this point. It caused displacement for thousands of citizens, and it was even worse when Moses ordered for the destruction of that station not even 60 years later. But that sparked a movement and encouraged people to create the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

That means we need to add housing for a million people just for the already exorbitant prices to stay where they are. Of course we're not doing that, so prices are going up significantly.   Agreed, but we have a zoning problem. Growth needs to be spread out, not chunked up into certain areas. In order for this to happen, NYC needs to sanction building more schools, public service buildings, and expand public transportation options to these areas. The reason why developers are targeting Manhattan, areas of Brooklyn, and soon enough, Queens, is because they already have access to these services. No one will go if they aren’t there, and the city won’t build them because no one is there.   The city should absolutely have programs designed to help low and middle class families purchase their apartments instead of encouraging them to be life-long renters. Show me a politician who wants to do this instead of enriching landlords and I'll support them.   As much as this idea sounds excellent on paper (it really does), it would cause a greater housing dilemma. NYC has a huge problem with landlords, we can agree on that. But more buyers means a greater permanence of residents and it brings you right back to the development vs preservation (of the apartment buildings people would now reside in) conflict."

nyc,3dib3w,daveeveryday,18,Thu Jul 16 14:31:33 2015 UTC,Do you generally avoid handles yourself?  Most doors have them.  Same people throwing away their trash walk into the same buildings and cabs as well as hold onto the same railings in the subway...that you do.
nyc,3dib3w,cstucks,5,Thu Jul 16 14:48:52 2015 UTC,NYC is probably the 20th city to implement this style of trash can. These are well past the point of experiment and haven't caused trash pile up in any of the other cities I've seen them in. It'll be alright.

nyc,3dc5kj,Druidshift,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"a taxi from Manhattan to Brooklyn can be like $100. If someone lives far away from Manhattan then usually they can't afford that   I don't think he's arguing that.  I think he's saying either pay the cab or don't get pass out drunk.  Because the subway is the worst alternative of all 3.  He's not saying ""Oh, just pay the cab, quick easy convenient and we all have disposable income amirite!??"
nyc,3dc5kj,ally-saurus,2,Wed Jul 15 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"Well, he did say, ""Even if you're buzzed, you could be vulnerable. Take a taxi."" A taxi home when I lived in Queens, even, was cheaper than a taxi home when I lived in Inwood. Try telling a cab driver to get on the West Side Highway and go up past the bridge - not only are you likely to get stuck in serious traffic (accidents, overnight road work, etc), you're going to want to tip him pretty well for the trip, which multiplies the cost to a huge degree. If I went out for dinner and a couple drinks, getting a little buzzed, I could easily more than double the tab just paying for a taxi home after. Versus the subway: free (with monthly card).  Personally I've definitely been more vulnerable when exhausted after an 18-hour workday, at 3am, than when buzzed or even just moderately drunk. That's when I've found myself nodding off the most. Once I woke several stops past my station. That sucked.   I'm a petite woman who looks very young, so I don't like to let my guard down on a deserted night train, but it has happened. One time after working two hard physical jobs back to back, all day long and past midnight, I woke to someone touching me timidly, then roughly. ""Hey,"" he said, "" HEY. Girl. Your money is falling out of your pocket."" I glanced down and saw that he was right. The change from my dinner money, which I'd carelessly stuffed in my front pocket in haste, had wriggled up. By the time I processed a) where I was, b) that I wasn't being assaulted, and c) what he had said, he was already out the door, getting off at his stop. I decided that in lieu of thanking him, I would just stand for the rest of the ride home, so that his kindness was not in vain and my $10 made it safely home, and me with it."
