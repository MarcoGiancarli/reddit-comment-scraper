psychology,3e2u9t,miper627,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:01 2015 UTC,Great post.  Did they test any moderators?  It would be interesting to see how relationship length and/or quality would effect these findings.
psychology,3e2u9t,meadski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Attachment styles can change over time. A perceived high quality relationship and increased trust in your partner can lead to a more secure relationship. But a poor quality one marked by bad experiences that cause you to distrust your partner can lead to an insecure attachment style. It would definitely be interesting to see how time and pairings of attachment styles (secure-anxious, anxious-avoidant, etc.) affect how much gets posted to Facebook."

psychology,3dxwxr,destroyingtocreate,4,Tue Jul 21 07:12:31 2015 UTC,"I'm probably reading it wrong but it sounds like the beauty is what is being seen by people being questioned. It seems that the people would be in a relationship no matter the race. The interracial relationships aren't the main tie it's the attractiveness. Better looking people tend to be in more relationships due to the attractiveness, the length of the relationship doesn't matter. I would think, and I have no statistical analysis but most interracial relationships like other relationships are mostly due to attraction more than not."
psychology,3dxwxr,EWF_X29,7,Tue Jul 21 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"No, they compared people in interracial relationships to people in relationships that were not interracial, and found that those in interracial relationships were significantly more likely to be rated as attractive by both their mates and by outsiders."

psychology,3dxwxr,fsmpastafarian,61,Mon Jul 20 13:11:51 2015 UTC,"These are really interesting results. It seems that the attractiveness ratings were only the participants rating themselves and also rating what they believed their partners thought of them. I wonder if these results could be explained by confidence: perhaps people who are willing to ignore social norms and date people outside of their own race despite potential social ""taboos"" are more confident on the whole, and so are more likely to perceive both themselves as more attractive, and also to estimate that their partner believes them to be attractive. Just a guess.   I think it's also important to note that the researchers mention most other research into this area has shown no significant difference between interracial and intraracial couples, so we should be cautious not to read too much into the results of a single study that apparently goes against other research in the area."
psychology,3dxwxr,peachykaren,32,Mon Jul 20 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"(Author here). The results of my study actually don't go against other research in the area. Other researchers focused on demographics and adjustment factors (e.g., self-esteem, acculturation) rather than personal qualities that are important in mate selection. However one should still be cautious about results from one study :)  Also, participants were rated by their partners and by third-party raters (research assistants who viewed photos of participants' faces)."

Helpless-Geek is correct in that interracial daters were actually rated as more attractive by their partners and by research assistants (who viewed images of individual participants' faces). I'm surprised that it's not mentioned in the PsyPost summary, but my explanation of the phenomenon is that people may require more positive qualities in their cross-race partners to offset the well-documented social costs of interracial dating. That is, because of the costs of interracial dating (e.g., disapproval from family, friends, and public), people might be motivated to date interracially if the partner has particularly attractive qualities."
psychology,3dxwxr,LibertarianBlue,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's interesting. At first I thought the conclusion was that interracial couples are perceived to be more attractive because they are interracial.

Also, I'm curious to know if there was a difference in the relationship rating between the partners and if this correlated to race. For instance, would a white female rate their relationship as less attractive than the Hispanic male in that relationship?  Anyway, it seems like an interesting study although I could only read the abstract and the press release, it would be nice if it could be replicated taking those things into account and including a larger African American sample."

Firstly, I doubt that ""cross-cultural attractive traits"" is something that's even readily and clearly defined rather than just a myth, and it may also mean that one's partner is simply more open-minded and/or sees the attractiveness in traits that they may not share themselves."
psychology,3dxwxr,peachykaren,3,Mon Jul 20 18:37:56 2015 UTC,No way. That could be measured. I feel like more eclectic people would be ones that could more easily have an interracial relationship with someone who comes from a totally different culture.   You would divide participants up into people that came from the same culture/social economic background and ones that did not.   Dating an asian american woman or an asian woman who now lives in the us is totally different.
psychology,3dxwxr,MrChipsAhoy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:52:45 2015 UTC,I agree that cultural similarities and differences in mate preferences can be measured. Check out this study by Buss et al (1990).

If the effect size is large enough, then the sample size is sufficient, even if it may seem to laymen like it's too small.

You don't need a bigger sample size. The population of a country has nothing to do with it, as you get an average and then scale it up.  When there's an election and people get asked, they don't ask most people. They ask maybe 100-5000 (or whatever) people and scale it up and say ""Well, there's 6 million in X country. 1/6 of the people in our sample said they'd vote for Y, so obviously 1 million votes for Y""."

I've seen people who hate public speaking say that means they have social anxiety; others who think being down for more than a week after the death of a loved one requires medicating (they could still function, just sad). Everything that is not perfect must be illness to some people...  About how often did you feel tired out for no good reason? About how often did you feel nervous? About how often did you feel so nervous that nothing could calm you down? About how often did you feel hopeless? About how often did you feel restless or fidgety? About how often did you feel so restless you could not sit still? About how often did you feel depressed? About how often did you feel that everything was an effort? About how often did you feel so sad that nothing could cheer you up? About how often did you feel worthless?"

psychology,3du2wi,Lightflow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"""The age"" as in even contemporary science. We're always trying to find out more about mental illness but it usually comes down to a reductionistic biomedical conception, e.g. Depression is a chemical imbalance. I think that our whole discourse of how we go about thinking about mental illness is based on bad assumptions and doesn't take cultural context into account as much as it should."
psychology,3du2wi,chowdahdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:39 2015 UTC,I think you're oversimplifying it. I doubt anyone at science headquaters really thinks about depression as chemical imbalance. It's just that to study anything we have to have these reductionistic-type approaches. Talking about cultural context will not give any real science to us.
psychology,3du2wi,Lightflow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:18 2015 UTC,"But see our problem is saying something reductionistic about depression doesn't mean you're capturing more of what depression ""IS"". Getting more reductionistic just describes how the disorders works but not why it might be there in the first place. And the other problem is that we think these ""disorders"" are objective things we are uncovering and are therefore more sciency, when cultural context plays a huge role in how we approach mental illness, even the scientific study of it."
psychology,3du2wi,chowdahdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"No need to capture what depression ""IS"". The only reason we would want that is to be able to do a better job of helping people suffering from it. And since what science does aimed towards exactly that - there is no need for this middle man.  Again, I doubt people think that mental disorders are some objective things. There are words that were invented to communicate to one another a specific set of psychological problems a person is having. And what we should try to do is to solve these problems. Going into discussions about what a certain mental disorder ""is"" or how objective it is useful only if we have an idea about to what possible real world benefit this conversation leads (that if we are scientists of course; on reddit we can babble whatever)."
psychology,3du2wi,Lightflow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you are saying, and at the end you say how useful this whole enterprise is. Bringing it back to the article, it is saying mental illness is on the rise. But is it really on the rise? Are we just redefining mental illness? Extending our diagnosis? What's the purpose/how useful is it of us. Are we just diagnosing more people or are people actually really suffering more? It all depends on how we define mental illness and what use it is of us to label people that way, thus my original comment of the ""the age of not knowing what mental illness really is"". It might not be that we are getting more accurate at identifying mental illnesses but that we are shifting the scale on how one meets that criteria in the first place, which many times relies on cultural contexts."
psychology,3du2wi,chowdahdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"But is it really on the rise? Are we just redefining mental illness? Extending our diagnosis? Are we just diagnosing more people or are people actually really suffering more?   I'm pretty sure statistics wasn't done that bad to have these kinds of mistakes in it. All these factors can be eliminated.  To me what it all says is that new technologies change the society into emotionally and otherwise - very unhealthy and unfriendly  place to live, with modern amounts of information bring to our evolved-for-other-purposes brains ever stronger blow, and as a result more and more of people injure their minds.  There are a lot of ways to differ healthy brain from unhealthy one. And just saying ""well, there are exceptions"" should not lead us into complete relativism. Point of it all is not to take with ourselves a piece of knowledge like ""mental illness is on the rise"", but to use this data to improve our lifes and our map of the world. What I take away from this is that there are known ways that current lifestyle harms our brains and that people aren't taking good care of themselves in that respect. Probably because we are yet to learn this lesson the hard way."
psychology,3du2wi,Lightflow,16,Mon Jul 20 22:49:01 2015 UTC,I would believe that we're much better at diagnosing issues now.  Given that there could be some false positives but mental illness is most likely just as prevalent as it was 100 years ago.
psychology,3du2wi,hhollowed235,13,Sun Jul 19 18:03:54 2015 UTC,"I think the faster pace of life and interconnectedness of the world thanks to technology also promotes mental illness, specifically anxiety and depressive disorders but that's just my personal opinion. Life was hard a 100 years ago but slower and with smaller communities."
psychology,3du2wi,JamesDaniels,5,Sun Jul 19 21:05:33 2015 UTC,"I agree also, I have both of those disorders and I think that's a part of them becoming more common. In the past you were unable to see how much better some people had it, or how a ""normal"" person behaves, but now with tv and the internet a man who lived in his small town his entire life and is well respected by the community still might develop a depression issue because he sees he hasn't really played a significant role in the world. Perhaps his wife is a little curvy, and while in the past she might feel beautiful, she can now see what the world thinks is beautiful in magazines and ads. She might start to feel anxiety or depression over her appearance that she would have no reason to feel in the past when people were only in contact with a few thousand (if that) people throughout their entire lives. Social media is a large factor I think, because you need to have it or you're considered abnormal (something TERRIFYING for someone with anxiety), but if you have it your life is on public display at all times which can cause anxiety. You also need to have the lives of everyone you've ever acquainted yourself with shoved in your face 24/7. This puts more pressure to act like people you see online, more pressure to go out and do things, more pressure to succeed, and more pressure to be normal. You need your life to stack up with other people's lives, because the metric for success is no longer your own experience, its the worlds' experience."
psychology,3du2wi,the_new_KING,6,Mon Jul 20 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think that's part of it, but I think the way we do work in America tends to make things harder.  Sure you could be a social phobic farmer, but at the same time, whatever job you did was permanent.  You were sure you'd be there until you had grey hairs.  Start as a groom in a village, and you'd stay as a groom on the same farm in the same village until you died.  That does a lot to promote mental health.  You get deeper relationships when you don't move every five years.  My dad is from a tiny town in Kansas, and everyone knows everyone else, the church was started by ancestors of the current residents, so you live work and play with the same people.  Your safety net, people you could trust.  The permanent job means that it's one less thing to worry about.  You would have that job and you know it will always feed you.  By contrast, in most of modern America, you change jobs fairly often, and even if you stay in the same company, you can be relocated across the country.  In some ways it's a nomadic existence except that it's one family, not a tribe.  And since layoffs are always coming, you have that stress on top of ripping up support networks, not having time for family (and not wanting to look bad by taking vacations), you end up with all of the worst things you could do for a person's mental health.  No security, high competition, weak or nonexistent social network, and constantly moving.  Not good for social apes like us."
psychology,3du2wi,maiqthetrue,3,Mon Jul 20 01:31:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. Our 'village' has for better or worse become to big. Although we have contact with vastly more people of differing cultures we lose out on a lot of high value bonds built over generations and through smaller communities.

But with all this new information people will hear about this or that and think ""oh I get nervous sometimes i must have anxiety"" or ""wait i get sad a lot i have depression"" and convince themselfs that they do and tell friends/family about it and if they go to a shrink about it, the shrink might diagnose and prescribe you with something to get a pay check or just to make you belive it and try to get better, it's a lot easier to help somekne with something than convince them there is no problem at all."

Chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety, and diabetes are being diagnosed in ever-increasing numbers in the developed (And developing) world and while some of this can be attributed to better screening it is also probable that diagnostic criteria have been changing over time to the point that normal psychological responses to life are now disorders.  I'm a layperson with regard to the field of psychology, I don't claim to be an authority, but it does appear that modern medicine is practiced under the assumption that our lives in a modern capitalist society are a baseline for what's ""normal"", which based on our evolutionary history could not be further from the truth.

But yes, I do think there are ways in which to help people take climate change more seriously.  One way, and this needs a lot more research, is to make the consequences of climate change more salient, or more proximal.  So many of the consequences are distal, we aren't even aware of many of the things happening.  So, if we make some of the consequences more salient to populations (i.e. really push ideas that people care about, such as animal species extinction) we might take climate change more seriously.  There are some really interesting priming studies out there too.  For example, one study asked about beliefs and attitudes toward climate change, and had two different conditions.  The first (the control group) had the lab, in which the participants filled out the measures, at normal room temperature.  The experimental condition only differed in that the room temperature was hotter.  In this condition, participants were more apt to believe climate change was happening.  This is another example of making climate change effects more proximal."

The upper estimate of 10% only applies to fairly uncritical acceptance of police statistics, where ""unfounded rape case"" can include cases where the victim didn't attempt to fight back, didn't use a weapon, if there's no physical evidence, etc, rather than it actually being false. The research shows that the more scrutiny you apply to the reporting methods used, the lower the statistic.  From what we know, the rate of ""false rape"" claims seems to be about the same as false rates for all other felonies. As for it being impossible to punish someone for false rape claims, you'll have to provide a citation for that. If a rape claim is proven to be false and that the person has lied, then at the very least they'll get in trouble for wasting police time.   If you're including cases that fall through or where the woman decides not to continue with the case as ""false rape"", then that's the problem with how sexism affects our view of rape.   I'm sorry I simply disagree that it's sexist. It's not similar to talking about black people pulling the ""race card,"" a more apt use of that would be if women pulled a ""woman card.""   I don't see how that's a more apt comparison. The ""race card"" is brought up when they feel that people are ""getting away"" with something based on an appeal to something they feel can't be questioned. Much like the ""rape card"".   Not everything involving a group of women in a negative way is sexist.   Sure, it's theoretically possible that a negative comment about women in general isn't sexist, but it's not very likely that a true comment can be made about women in general without relying on some sexist assumption. It's a pretty diverse group.    It is unfortunate so many women get away with false rape claims IMO.   But you haven't demonstrated that anyone gets away with it. We can accept that a small percentage of people lie about a crime (at a rate similar to other crimes). But that doesn't show: a) women are making these claims (men make false rape claims too, you might remember the /r/mensrights debacle where they filed thousands of false rape reports), and b) that they weren't punished.   We don't even know the real numbers for that, seeing as so many cases come down to ""he raped me"" ""no I didn't"" sorta stuff which judges can't really go either way on.

I think you're just reading that in a specific tone to suit your own notions when in reality it could be read in various ways.   You're analogy doesn't work because they are vastly different contexts. There is no widespread culture which excuses terrorism or explains that things aren't ""real"" terrorism, or accuses terrorism victims as ""faking it"" or ""asking for it"", etc.   A better example would be to say: ""It's unfortunate that so many Muslims get away with terrorist attacks"". There's obvious Islamophobia and racism inherent in that statement because it confirms so many assumptions people have about Muslims.   Blame those 2-10% who do make false rape claims for the support of rape culture, not the guys who think 2-10% of claims of a specific sort of crime being false when the crime can completely fuck up your life is a lot.   But that tiny percentage of false claims don't make a difference to rape culture. Sexists used it as an excuse for their sexism, an after-the-fact justification. If false crime reports could result in something like rape culture, then why isn't there a ""theft culture"", ""embezzlement culture"", ""assault culture"" etc?   There are similar rates of false reports there but rape is treated different by society, why? Because the rape culture is there to start with.  Nobody disagrees that false crime reports are bad, but talking about them as if they were common or dominating discussion of rape by talking about them creates a false equivalence between rape and false rapes, and leads to the idea that most women are faking it. I mean, how often have you heard sexists say things like: ""well, was she really raped or was she just drunk and regretted it in the morning?""?   Either way that's barely extreme sexism, at worst it's sexism by kinda supporting ""rape culture"" which I guess makes it sexist instead of directly being sexist.   It's not claimed to be extreme sexism, it's just sexism. Did you think ""hostile sexism"" meant ""really, really bad sexism""? It's just the counterpart to benevolent sexism, so refers to negative traits or comments being made about women."

I clarified that appealing to the problem of evidence in rape cases doesn't give us any reason at all to suspect that some might include false rape reports.

psychology,3dmkwb,Autodidact420,2,Sun Jul 19 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"In a context like this, I would say there isn't. I would agree with that statement, or any other statement about a sub-group. Saying something about a sub-group does not mean that you hate the group as a whole.    But there is. You refusing to accept it doesn't make it disappear. If I pick out an arbitrary trait that people within a group happen to share and then use that trait as part of my causal explanation of the outcome, then that is going to be some kind of prejudice or bigotry. When it involves skin colour, we typically refer to that as ""racism"".  Put it this way: suppose there's a rash of crime in an area where young kids are going around smashing stuff and stealing things. We're in an area that is predominantly black. If we start saying things like, ""It's unfortunate that black kids are getting away with breaking and stealing things"" then you are explicitly making the claim about race when race has nothing to do with it. That is a textbook example of racism.   If I dislike people who skip lines in walmart, I don't dislike all walmart goers. If you were to ask, I dislike people who skip lines regardless of the store. The negative group I was talking about was women who make false rape claims, not women who suffered rape, not women who have no part in any rape. I was also only being specific because of the context, any false rape report is equally as bad.   The Walmart example doesn't work because you aren't specifying an arbitrary characteristic to use as part of your causal explanation.  Look, I'll put it another way: why specify ""women""? If people think false rape reports are bad and it's unfortunate if people who make them get away with it, why specify women? It makes no sense. It only makes sense if there is some sexist assumption underlying it.    If some are able to be proven false, one would assume that some of the ones that can't be decided either way would also likely be false, but it's impossible to tell which ones, so to avoid throwing people in jail or fining them when they're not the one at fault it's better to do nothing.   Except there's no reason to make this assumption. Some might be false, or not might be. We don't know, we have no reason for assuming either way.    Again, many studies find higher, it depends entirely on what you count as evidence as false rape.   No good studies go higher than that. Even the 10% upper estimate is way above the vast majority of studies on this topic.   That's too many. I would agree with a statement. If you think about it logically, the statement ""It's unfortunate so many women..."" means it's unfortunate that some, as in a number larger than 0.   Except people don't talk like that and your ""explanation"" requires us to ignore a whole lot of context. Even framing it as a significant problem and one in particular that we need to be concerned with, is an issue in itself - nevermind the singling out of women or the assumption that they get away with it, or the use of the term ""card"" that is regularly used by bigots to dismiss things they don't like.   Because both are minority groups consisting clearly of people who are innocent and guilty,the rape card may imply that they are the ones who are lying about rape. A black person playing the race card only means they're black, although it could also be said it's unfortunate any group uses a ""card"" for something they shouldn't be doing.   I don't understand your first bit - the term ""rape card"" absolutely means that they think the person is lying about being raped. And it applies to the ""race card"", in that there is the implication that they are lying about their race being relevant to the issue.   I haven't demonstrated that around 2% if not more is the common figure that turns up in studies? The study you linked lists about 2% as the lowest in the studies they cite. They also say more scrutiny (define?) lowers that. What is exactly meant? Clearly it's not just unproven cases, as those are around 40%.   No, I said you haven't demonstrated that they get away with it.   ""Scrutiny"" here refers to an operationalisation of terms to avoid lumping in false positives with actual cases. So when a police report says that the rape charge was ""false"" on the basis that the woman didn't use a weapon, but everything else was consistent with rape, a good study would reject that as a ""false rape"" case. When the study says 40% are uncertain, it's referring to papers that include examples like that but present little other data for them to determine whether what they've defined as ""false rape"" was actually a false rape charge or not.   In my opinion lying about any major crime should be a major offense, when you're slandering someone else. Saying you got robbed by an unknown person is different than saying you saw Bobby kill your pet dog and steal your car last night.   This is probably an opinion issue but I don't think it should be treated as a major crime. I think assault is a major crime, but saying false accusations of assault are also a major crime make it seem like the actions are comparable in some way when they aren't. That isn't to say they shouldn't be taken seriously and punished accordingly, just that we need to keep some perspective.    If anything it'd be something along the lines of ""It's unfortunate so many muslims have extremist beliefs"" which again, I would agree with, and then in a real conversation point out that many groups have extremist beliefs.    My analogy is more apt but if you want to change it you can, it doesn't really help your case much since ascribing ""extremist belief"" to Muslims is still a really problematic statement. The only reason it might intuitively seem more palatable than the terrorist statement is because the word ""extremist"" is pretty vague and could be twisted to account for many religious beliefs.    You're the one projecting ""rape culture"" onto someones agreeing with a poorly worded, logically acceptable, statement.   I'm not projecting anything onto the carefully constructed, illogical statement. The scientific research that has honed and perfected their measure is reaching a conclusion based in evidence. And I'm really not convinced that you understand what you're trying to critique or why you're not doing a very good job of it.   I really feel like you've taken this personally. Maybe you hold that belief or you at least find it ""logical"", and you've taken it as an insult that something you think is ""logical"" happens to be a rallying cry of the sexist (which you obviously don't want to be). It seems like a typical case of cognitive dissonance where you need some way to resolve the conflict and that's why you're coming up with these convoluted and nonsensical ""criticisms"" of a robust measure of sexism.  And I mean, let's be absolutely clear here: nobody is being defined as ""sexist"" or ""supporting rape culture"" based on their response to a single question. I didn't think I needed to clarify that earlier but maybe I need to. It's a long survey with multiple questions and designed in a way to reveal a complex interaction of attitudes and beliefs. It's okay for someone to respond in the affirmative to a number of ideas which have been designated as an indicator of sexism - it doesn't necessarily make the person sexist.   You're gonna have to go a lot deeper so that I can actually know exactly what I'm replying to here.   I'm not sure how much deeper it's possible to go there, the argument is spelt out in as much detail as I can. The point is that false rape claims aren't producing rape culture. They just aren't - if they were then false claims of other crimes would have the same effect. Getting rid of false rape claims would have absolutely no effect on rape culture.    It's not sexism IMO. It's a sentence that anyone should agree with if presented in a vacuum like that.   Fuck no, why would anyone accept a statement littered with sexist assumptions that leads to a nonsensical conclusion that isn't supported by any evidence?"

Smarter people are racist because they don't like housing programs and affirmative action? Could it just be that they don't think those policies are good? Seems like people take shit from poorly worded or poorly planned studies and extrapolate to ridiculous points.   It doesn't seem particularly ""ridiculous"" to me. If someone is arguing against something like affirmative action then they're very, very likely to be racist. Is it possible that there is someone out there that opposes it for non-racist reasons? Sure, maybe. Not likely though.

But how can it be ""bias"" when they present the empirical data to support their views? Look at it from my perspective here: I read an academic, peer-reviewed paper that uses a well-researched measure that has repeatedly demonstrated it's validity and reliability, and on top of that the authors include a bounty of empirical data that support their generalisations to the real world.   In contrast, you tell me that you think they're wrong because they're ""biased"". Why should I believe you rather than thinking you're the biased one? I'm not even convinced that you've read the paper, which strengthens the idea that you're biased.   White people support minorities going to universities or living in their neighbor hood while saying that there shouldn't be policies indicating that only whites may live somewhere, or that lower-scoring minorities may get into the same level school? Maybe they think any neighborhood should be able to discriminate against anyone, or maybe they think that any policies should address an individuals societal status and economic position, geographic position, etc. instead of just the color of their skin.   Maybe that's true, but the data the authors present show that such explanations account for very little of the variance in their predictions. So what's your argument against that?   Again, perhaps he's wrong- they disagree with the specific policies that are aimed to address it in favor of better policies which address what they think are the real issues. It's not racism.   Yes, but I'm telling you that they explicitly deal with your objection in their paper and present empirical data to show exactly why it doesn't affect their results.  I don't understand why you keep repeating your position without addressing their arguments."
psychology,3dmkwb,mrsamsa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:26 2015 UTC,"An alternative explanation for the pattern of attitudinal effects discussed previously is that high-ability whites are indeed committed to racial equality both in principle and in practice, but compared to their low-ability counterparts, they are also better attuned to the dangers of policies that violate individual rights. For example, because workplace racial preferences privilege group rights over individual rights, whites with advanced cognitive abilities may oppose this policy not out of concern for protecting their own privileged social position but rather out of a truly race-neutral concern for protecting individual rights over group rights. Another variant of this explanation contends that whites with higher cognitive abilities are better attuned to the dangers of government expansion, and would oppose policies like school busing  Are Smart People Less Racist? Cognitive Ability, Anti-Black Prejudice, and the Principle-Policy Paradox 23 programs because they involve an expansion of government powers. These alternative explanations suggest that it is high-ability whites’ greater commitment to race-neutral individualism, rather than their more nuanced ability to avoid the appearance of racism while defending their group interests, that is behind the principle-policy paradox—an interpretation that is not consistent with ideological refinement theory. To assess these alternative explanations, I analyze the net effects of cognitive ability on environmental policy attitudes. If advanced cognitive abilities promote a race-neutral commitment to individualism and a general aversion to government policies that limit individual rights, whites with higher cognitive ability would be expected to oppose not only racial policies that infringe upon individual rights but also environmental policies that involve government limitation of individual rights.  In sharp contrast to the effects of cognitive ability on racial policy attitudes, the estimates in Table 5 indicate that cognitive ability has a highly significant positive impact on support for environmental policies described as requiring “much higher taxes” and “government laws” that intrude on the rights of either individuals or businesses.   I think they're going after the wrong fish. The metrics they used as things they shouldn't support, are in my opinion, not related as well as the author thinks they are. There are philosophical/political ideologies that are at least moderately coherent which would suggest the same. Again, this is biased because the metrics which they test against in this specific example are very broad, as opposed to the specific programs. I'm against some government environmental programs, I'm also as a whole very much for higher taxes etc. to help stop climate change.   My stance is the same. I think they're assuming too much about the specific beliefs of these people based on their ideas about specific government programs."
psychology,3dmkwb,Autodidact420,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"They aren't assuming anything, they deal with your objection in the Discussion section (as that's where authors typically address possible objections to their arguments).   Although the effects of cognitive ability on racial attitudes observed in this study are consistent with ideological refinement theory, there remain several alternative explanations for these patterns. First, it is possible that high-ability whites oppose remedial policies for racial inequality not because they are concerned about protecting their group interests or because they secretly harbor anti-black sentiments. Rather, intelligent whites may oppose these policies because they are perceived to be ineffective at achieving their intended goal of ameliorating racial inequality. According to this argument, if extant racial policies were more effective at reducing segregation, eliminating discrimination, and realizing a more equal distribution of resources between racial groups, intelligent whites would actively support these programs.  Although this alternative explanation cannot be completely dismissed without gathering new data on the reasons why intelligent whites oppose various affirmative action policies, in the volumes of previous research on determinants of whites’ racial policy attitudes, concerns about efficacy have not been identified as an important explanatory factor. Instead, previous research consistently highlights the considerable explanatory power of prejudice and racism in various guises (e.g., “old-fashioned” racism, anti-black stereotyping, symbolic racism), different types of political ideology (e.g., egalitarianism, conservatism, individualism), and concern about groupor self-interests (Harrison, Kravitz, Mayer, Leslie, and Lev-Arey 2006; Kluegel and Smith 1983; Krysan 2000; Sears, Sidanius, and Bobo 2000; Sears, Hensler, and Speer 1979; Tuch and Martin 1997)."

psychology,3dkdec,pink_mango,34,Fri Jul 17 04:02:50 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best to explain it. Selective mutism, in a way, is like being paralyzed. You have a strong desire to speak, but your voice won't work.   I believe that I had an overactive mind, and that's one of the reasons why I couldn't speak. I would worry that I might say something wrong or embarrassing when I spoke, and I did this for so long that it created an even worse fear.   Because I didn't talk to anyone for so long, I feared that if I suddenly did start talking, people would ask me questions like ""why didn't you ever talk before?"" or ""why did it take you so long to start talking?"". These fears were so intense that it became impossible for me to speak.  I had a strong desire to speak, but no matter how hard I tried and how badly I wanted it, the words would never come out. Interestingly enough, I had no problems talking at home. I was outgoing and acted just like any other normal kid. My selective mutism would only cause problems when I was expected to talk to someone who wasn't my family.   This was mostly teachers and classmates. Teachers I could speak with, but only if they asked me questions and I would respond with a simple and short answer. Classmates I couldn't speak to at all. Nodding my head was the best I could do.   I believe people with selective mutism have very low self-esteem and very little self-confidence. My ego was fragile and saying or doing anything that could result in embarrassment was something that I greatly feared.   I'm not a psychologist or any type of professional who treats mentally ill people, but I would like to give advice to people who are treating or may one day treat someone with selective mutism.   Understand that our inability to talk can't be treated with talk therapy alone and it won't be improved with medications. Medications can treat the physical symptoms of our anxiety, but it does nothing to treat the real problem. For whatever reason, we learned to associate fear with speaking. It's a fear that happens unconsciously and it takes a lot of work to unlearn that fear.   I think the best treatment would be CBT alongside talk therapy. I also wouldn't overlook the lesser used treatments like hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy might not be as popular as other treatments, but it's helped my anxiety is more ways than talk therapy and medications ever has."

psychology,3dkdec,Sumido,5,Fri Jul 17 07:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think age had a lot to do with overcoming my selective mutism. Some of the symptoms are still present, but as I got older, they became less of a problem. I think being in relationships may have helped too since I was never in a relationship when I was younger. Learning coping mechanisms like breathing exercises, self-talk, meditation, and changing my negative way of thinking helped a lot also.  The best way someone can help to reduce my anxiety is by showing me kindness and compassion. The tough love approach has never worked for me. I'm more likely to feel comfortable socializing if someone doesn't belittle my anxiety and lets me know that it's okay to feel like this, but also encourages me to socialize more."
psychology,3dkdec,-kodoku-,9,Fri Jul 17 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"I believe people with selective mutism have very low self-esteem and very little self-confidence.   I had selective mutism too, but it was not fully recognized by those I lived with. I was nearly diagnosed with autism at the age of 6, but because I was a girl rather than a boy [who the original discoverers studied]and this was the early 1970s, it was not fully recognized. Instead they said ""she's almost autistic"" [turns out I am]. But this was not so much a low self esteem as it was intimidation of a young girl that was bullied by everyone [99%] for being who I was: very emotionally and sensory-sensitive and socially impaired. I had all the classic signs of autism and a few others that at least some autistics have, such as incoordination (fine motor and gross motor) and a larger than average hat-size.  I am pretty doubtful that I had a self-esteem issue as an infant; this is when my autistic symptoms showed up but were not recognized enough to even cause them to seek a diagnosis. Logophilic/unusual first word: (delicious), yet also the ""selective mutism"". All of these things, because they were not recognized, were instead punished and loudly lectured about. I'm sure this eventually lead to self-esteem problems, but it did not cause the selective mutism, for me at least."
psychology,3dkdec,dogGirl666,3,Fri Jul 17 09:27:09 2015 UTC,"I actually have autism too. At least that's what my psychiatrist says. I'm conflicted since I do match many of the symptoms of autism, but many of those symptoms can also be explained by selective mutism. For example, people with selective mutism can also experience sensory issues and lack of social skills can be caused by not socializing enough.   People with autism have a difficult time understanding non-verbal language, but I feel like that's not much of a problem for me. I feel that I'm empathetic and can get an idea of how a person is feeling by analyzing their body language and facial expressions. I'm told that people with autism aren't able to do that.   Autism is on a spectrum though, so it's still possible that I have it. It's odd though since I didn't really show symptoms of autism as a child. Now that I'm an adult though, I seem to match a lot more of the symptoms. I wonder if my selective mutism masked some of my autism symptoms and that's why I wasn't diagnosed when I was a child."

I couldn't speak to classmates and I could only talk to my teachers if they asked me a question.   I think selective mutism is something that gets better the older you get, but it doesn't disappear when you become an adult. I think that's one of the common myths people have. I can talk to almost any person now, but there are still times when I nod my head to answer yes and no questions.  I also don't talk very much when I'm having a conversation.

I think the worst thing about selective mutism is that I never learned the social skills I needed as a child. We're social creatures and because I rarely talked to people my own age, I wasn't able to learn the social skills that most people have.

A quick overview of the literature shows how complicated this issue can be.  Restricting ourselves to only Facebook:  Looking into emotional well-being of undergraduates, Kalpidou et. al. suggest that as older students learn to use Facebook to effectively engage with their peers, this is positively associated with emotional and academic adjustment. However, with younger students, the relationship between number of friends and emotional adjustment was negative. (Kalpidou, M., Costin, D., & Morris, J. (2011). The relationship between Facebook and the well-being of undergraduate college students. CyberPsychology, behavior, and social networking, 14(4), 183-189.)  Manago et. al. found that large social networks were associated with larger perceived social support, which is also associated with higher self-esteem. But they warn that large social networking sites could augment narcissistic personality traits. (Kalpidou, M., Costin, D., & Morris, J. (2011).

Valenzuela et. al. found that Facebook use was associated with significant effects in life satisfaction, social trust, etc., but with the caveat that the effects are fairly small.

None of these studies provide absolute answers, and it's easy to find problems with methods in all these studies, as if often the case when trying to design experiments or observational studies to understand human behavior. Nevertheless, I've only mentioned a few studies within the huge body of work trying to understand the effects of social media use. To simply start off this article by mentioning ""growing amount of research illustrating the negative impact Facebook usage has on overall happiness"" without any citations or dealing with that critically is rather misleading. I certainly don't mean to imply that there is never negative effects from using social media, but it's a much larger story and we should be careful about the claims we're making given all the ongoing work here."

However, if I do use such strategies, it reinforces the view that my memory is faulty. If it wasn't, why would I use all these strategies?

psychology,3d9vw1,dc295,5,Wed Jul 15 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"Citation needed, but I think most treatments for depression have the same ultimate mechanism of action: stimulating brain growth.  Most antidepressants increase either the amount of neurotransmitters in the brain or the time they spend sitting in the synapses, which stimulates growth. This is why antidepressants take many weeks to have an effect, despite the antidepressants changing the neurotransmitter behavior almost immediately. The neuron growth takes time.  Electroconvulsive therapy triggers neurotrophic effects in the medial temporal lobe, where the hippocampus is located.  Light therapy modulates LTP in the hippocampus.  Cognitive behavioral therapy and meditation decrease stress, and the hippocampus is especially vulnerable to cortisol."

psychology,3d9vw1,CaseyLC,3,Tue Jul 14 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"Very cool study, but the statement that it ""has proved once and for all that recurrent depression shrinks the hippocampus"" is not quite true.   Most importantly, the study cannot defy the hypothesis that childhood adversity causes hippocampal shrinkage and that either  childhood adversity or reduced hippocampal volume 'causes' adult  depression before age 21 and/or adult recurrent depression. There is a (rather recent) line of research associating self-reported childhood (emotional) abuse with decreased hippocampal volume, also in (adult) participants that did not (yet?) develop depression (e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868665/ & http://www.pnas.org/content/109/9/E563.full).   To further illustrate the difficulties here: an even more 'remote' explanation that also cannot be ruled out by the study at hand, is that a genetic predisposition may cause both depression and reduced hippocampal volume (without either of these affecting the other). If that would be the case, we could observe parents suffering depression resulting in their (grown-up) child reporting childhood emotional abuse/neglect, while the (adult) child may also suffer depression (due to either genetic predisposition, childhood adversity or both), ánd reduced hippocampal volume may be observed in both parent and child without being causally related (in either direction) to either childhood abuse or depression.   The only way to establish that depression causes hippocampal atrophy (with almost certainty) is to actually follow people over time and measuring their hippocampal volume before and after depressive episodes."
psychology,3d9vw1,penthiseleia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:05:02 2015 UTC,Agree on the first paragraph. But I'm not very sure if a cohort MRI study would be enough for establishing casual relationships. It could be due to common causes of both hippocampus shrinkage and depression.  Only a RCT could help. Suppose there's a very good depression prevention programme. You randomly assign a few hundred at-risk people into a super-effective depression prevention programme and the others to a 'routine-practice' group. Any difference in hippocampus volume at the end would be due to depression. But these kind of studies would never be possible because of obvious reasons.
psychology,3d9vw1,crescal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"I see your thinking and I agree mostly, but am not sure if your argument against a cohort study would not also apply to the experimental set-up that you propose. For sake of the mental exercise of putting things into absurdum: what's to say that the super-effective depression preventive programme (SEDPP) did not also target this putative elusive common cause of both depression and hippocampal shrinkage, thereby preventing both from occurring?   And to do the same to my cohort design: if this would be a large sample of never-previously-depressed individuals (i.e. those that would be considered less vulnerable in the more typical 'previous depressed vs never-depressed type designs) that would be 're-diagnosed' and scanned at regular intervals, would then a consistent co-occurence of hippocampal volume loss and depressive episodes (in the absence of hippocampal volume changes unaccompanied by depression) be sufficiently convincing? Or still not?"
psychology,3d9vw1,penthiseleia,16,Wed Jul 15 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"Typical. The effects seen here are possibly caused by antidepressant use and not depression. The study itself says that when you look at the underlying data, there is a trend that studies with higher % of antidepressant use show lower hippocampal volume. Then they basically toss that concern aside with some hand waving. And their criteria for antidepressant use was very weak - you had to currently be on antidepressants. It said nothing about lifetime use.  The fact is that this result makes little sense in any other context. To wit: severity of depression does not correlate with the shrinkage in volume, but early age of first onset and repeated episodes do. This is possibly because early age of onset and those with repeated episodes are exposed to the most antidepressant use.  Just as antipsychotic use was found to increase caudate volume, antidepressant use may be responsible for the decreased hippocampal volume. I leave it to others to ponder why one increases volume and the other decreases volume.  Regardless of whether the effect is from antidepressant use, there could be other explanations that are more plausible as well. For instance, those with smaller hippocampal volumes may be predisposed to depression."

psychology,3d9vw1,acetylinsomnia,3,Wed Jul 15 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"Clicked your links. Was exactly what I was expecting. The whole BDNF/neurogenesis crap. I find this line of research very upsetting because it is either deliberately or stupidly misinterpreting the results. This neurogenesis thing has really been harnessed to prop up psychotropic drugs. In fact, the reality of what is going on is the opposite of what the studies conclude.  You have some normal level of BDNF/neurogenesis occurring in your brain - a baseline. What studies show is that various treatments: antidepressants, antipsychotics, ECT, increase BDNF expression and therefore neurogenesis in the brain. But here is the problem: neurogenesis above baseline occurs in the presence of brain damage. In fact, another place where you see similar increases in BDNF and neurogenesis is with strokes and traumatic brain injuries. BDNF expression increases in response to trauma in the brain.  Now, some studies have found that exercise moderately increases BDNF expression, and this has been parroted endlessly by researchers in this area as an attempt to say that drugs are more like exercise than strokes. I do not believe it. I find the whole thing incredible.  For a great example, there is no denying any more that antipsychotics cause serious brain damage. There is just too much evidence. And there we see it: antipsychotics are very good at increasing BDNF expression. Electroconvulsive therapy is also very good at increasing BDNF expression. It is also very good at causing extreme memory loss, cognitive decline, and various other maladies - clear signs of brain damage. How much do you want to bet on antidepressant induced increases in BDNF being a good thing?   At some point in the future - perhaps a few decades - all of this BDNF research will come crashing down. But it will all be worth it, as between now and then trillions of dollars will be made continuing to sell the drugs. Drug companies know they can only forestall the inevitable, not prevent it, which is one reason why many of them have left the psychiatric drug market, not undertaking any new research."
psychology,3d9vw1,owatonna,2,Wed Jul 15 12:44:48 2015 UTC,"Clearly, you didn't click on those links because only two of those studies deal with BDNF expression  ""There is ample evidence that depression and stress can be ameliorated through the use of physical exercise and/or antidepressant drugs. Both have been shown to promote neuroprotection against atrophy of dendrites and neuronal death through the activation of pro-survival signaling pathways, such as that of phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinase (PI-3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Depriving neurons in culture of several vital nutrients provides a viable model of neuronal stress, trauma or insult that occurs in vivo. Therefore, we sought to evaluate if various antidepressants are indeed neuroprotective in this model of nutrient deprivation stress. In addition, we evaluated if three key pro-survival pathways (PI-3K, MAPK, protein kinase A) are necessary for such neuroprotection. We used quantitative Western blotting to evaluate the immunoreactivity levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, PI-3K, phospho-protein kinase B (P-Akt), phospho-MAPK and phospho-cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, and live/dead cytotoxicity assay to evaluate cell survival. We demonstrate that in the ideal conditions of nutrient supplement, norepinephrine, serotonin and three antidepressants increased all six outcome measures; however, in the absence of such nutrients, only P-Akt levels showed signs of decreasing. In the presence of pro-survival pathway inhibitor, however, five out of the six outcome measures decreased (not P-Akt), relative to those of the ideal conditions of nutrient supplement. Thus, pro-survival pathway integrity, which more directly affects gene expression, is more important than the presence of externally placed nutrients for cell survival. We discuss our results in the context of receptor and pathway cross-talk, indicating that pharmacological rescue of neuronal atrophy/death in the face of mood disorders requires that pro-survival pathways remain intact.""  ""Antidepressants increase hippocampal adult neurogenesis following chronic but not acute treatment. Chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine, the MAOI tranylcypromine, or the SNRI reboxetine produced an approximately 20% to 40% increase in bromodeoxyuridine BrdU-labeled hippocampal cells145; at least 2 weeks of fluoxetine treatment was required to enhance neurogenesis. Furthermore, while stress decreases hippocampal neurogenesis, chronic antidepressant treatment prevented these stress-induced changes.146,147 ECT also increased neurogenesis in rodents,148 as well as hippocampal synapse number.149 ECT was similarly found to increase neurogenesis in nonhuman primates,150 and exercise increased hippocampal neurogenesis151 in addition to enhancing hippocampal-dependent learning and long-term potentiation (LTP).151 ""  But it'll all come crashing down eventually, right?

psychology,3d9vw1,acetylinsomnia,2,Thu Jul 16 01:27:25 2015 UTC,"Clearly, you didn't click on those links because only two of those studies deal with BDNF expression   I did click the links, and I did look at them. I only commented on BDNF because the other stuff is similar. It is all just branches of the same tree of crap. Honestly, I cannot believe that people believe this crap. There are more holes in this research than a slice of swiss cheese.  First of all, one assumption that is made in this research is that exercise raises BDNF (and the other markers in your other studies if that makes you happy). We also have a pretty good idea that these chemicals are involved in cell repair and growth (although what we do know is probably dwarfed by what we do not - something that is often forgotten). Therefore, the fantastical leap is made that since drugs increase the levels of these chemicals, they must be just like exercise. But to make this assumption, you have to ignore at least two major issues: 1) strokes and traumatic brain injuries also cause the same increases. That's okay. We can just close our eyes and pretend we don't know this. 2) The most incredible part: that if X causes Y and we know X is good, then when Z causes Y, it must mean Z is good. Example: exercise increases your heart rate. So does cocaine. Therefore, cocaine must be good for you like exercise.  Next up is all the inconsistencies and things that downright do not make sense. We know that antipsychotics cause brain damage. It is undeniable at this point. If you do not believe me, go do some research. And there you see it: antipsychotics raise levels of all these things. It is also crystal clear that ECT causes brain damage. There is still a lot of denial of this, but large numbers of people have permanent memory loss and cognitive decline. What do you think causes this? Memory loss is always a red flag for brain damage. Seriously people, what do you think is the effect of passing large amounts of electricity through the brain?  One of your links talks about how great lithium is at all these things, like activating the ""intracellular MAPK/ERK signaling pathway"". Lithium! This is a drug that was originally described as ""treatment by Lithium poisoning"". Lithium is a toxic metal - there is no denying this. Do you not understand that all these processes linked to neurogenesis are activated by these drugs because these drugs damage and kill brain cells, prompting the brain to activate its repair mechanisms? This is bone dead simple stuff.  Perhaps the best example of the contradictions in these studies is the lack of difference between the various drug classes. We are led to believe that things like BDNF expression are responsible for the effects of antidepressants. Yet antipsychotics will increase BDNF even more - and those drugs are the farthest thing from an antidepressant you can find. They suck the life out of you. Similar with other drugs and other effects. The only common thread is that all of these drugs are either known to cause brain damage or are suspected of causing brain damage. That is it.   All of those researchers are wrong and you're right, it's all a pharmaceutical conspiracy.   Typical appeal to authority. Never mind that all those researchers have a track record of being wrong on all this. The ""Serotonin Hypothesis"" of depression worked out real great, didn't it? Same with the ""Dopamine Hypothesis"" of schizophrenia. I could go on and on. All these things that were formerly gospel are now on the trash heap. There are a lot of reasons for this that could take a book length explanation (and there are some books on it already), but it feels a lot easier to just boil it down into a one sentence talking point about a ""conspiracy"". Sorry, but yes, pharmaceutical companies are a large part of why the research is so wrong and has been so wrong for decades. Anyone who denies that lives in a fantasy world."

psychology,3d9vw1,Joseph_Santos1,2,Wed Jul 15 12:47:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, as I indicated in my response. The trend was toward an effect, but just barely missed significance. The problem is: 1) this was a comparison of particular studies, of which the N was small and therefore required a large effect to be measured, and 2) their definition of antidepressant use was very weak, as it only measured current users and not lifetime exposure, which is far more important.  Given those facts, this study in fact provides support for the suspicion that drug use is a at least a factor. It does not confirm it since the result measured was below statistical significance, but it also does nothing to rule it out. The way they measured it was very indirect, lacking in an accurate definition, and almost guaranteed to be underpowered to produce a significant result."

Where does it say that in the study?  And also, I am not saying one way or the other. I am saying the possibility remains that the drugs caused some or all of the effect.

psychology,3d9vw1,owatonna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"It's actually in reference 38.   Structural brain abnormalities have been widely reported in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, many previous results cannot exclude the interferences of medication or multiple recurrent episodes. In this study, we examined structural brain abnormalities by comparing 68 drug-naïve first-episode adult-onset MDD and 68 healthy controls (HCs). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) methods were used. The mean values of grey matter volume/white matter volume (GMV/WMV) were calculated, then the differences between MDD and HCs were analyzed, and the associations of the differences with clinical characteristics of depression were discussed. The whole brain GMV/WMV did not differ between MDD patients and HCs; however, the regional GMV of the right pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) was smaller in MDD patients. The GMV of both hippocampi was positively correlated with symptom severity and lower in patients with long durations. These results indicate the GMV reduction of the pre-SMA at an early stage of depression, whereas the GMV of the hippocampus is associated with depressive characteristics. Moreover, the whole brain GMV/WMV was negatively related to the duration of depression, supporting that volume loss could become progressive during the development of disease. These results may suggest the importance of identifying and intervening depression at an early stage, especially the first year after onset, to prevent volume loss in the brain."
psychology,3d9vw1,Joseph_Santos1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"So, in one of the references. And that reference has serious problems. Just briefly looking at it, these two statements are somewhat internally contradictory:   The whole brain GMV/WMV did not differ between MDD patients and HCs  Moreover, the whole brain GMV/WMV was negatively related to the duration of depression   The brains of the depressed group did not differ from healthy controls, but within the depressed group itself there was a relation between this size and duration of depression. This does not compute with their next statement:   supporting that volume loss could become progressive during the development of disease.   Uh, if overall volume is the same, no, a finding of differences within the depressed group does not indicate volume loss is progressive. It possibly indicates a spurious result.  Here is another problem: this study contradicts the one being linked from. In the study under discussion, first-episode and late onset patients showed no difference from healthy controls. Differences only appeared for those who had recurrent episodes and/or early age onset. The study under discussion also found that volume was not related to severity of symptoms, while this study found the opposite.  This is one of the reasons I really dislike brain imaging studies: there is almost no consistency from study to study. The findings are like a giant pin the tail on the donkey, with researchers always seeming to find exactly what it is they expect to see."
psychology,3d9vw1,owatonna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"You're reading this wrong.   The whole brain GMV/WMV did not differ between MDD patients and HCs.   Meaning the entirety of both grey and white matter did not differ significantly from their initial calculations. But when they focused solely on grey matter volume, they found a significant difference.   Moreover, the whole brain GMV/WMV was negatively related to the duration of depression   See the above.   Uh, if overall volume is the same, no, a finding of differences within the depressed group does not indicate volume loss is progressive.   They also said ""The GMV of both hippocampi was positively correlated with symptom severity and lower in patients with long durations,"" not GMV/WMV. Since GMV reductions was the only volume loss found, this is the volume loss they're referring to. It's not a contradiction.

The problem I suspect you're having is that ""brain damage"" is a word that tends to imply some kind of traumatic incident where the tissue of the brain is pierced or bruised in some way, when in research like this they're using a broader understanding that basically just means: ""a dysfunctional change in the brain that leads to negative outcomes"".   What this means is that since our psychological states have to be represented in some way in the brain, then being ""depressed"" will have a specific brain state associated with it and since depression is a negative outcome, we will define this change in brain states as ""brain damage""."
