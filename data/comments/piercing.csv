piercing,3e3rst,GiveIntoMadness,8,Tue Jul 21 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"A standard lobe piercing is pretty acceptable these days. My husband has a lobe and helix on the same ear and they haven't prevented him from having professional jobs.   Maintenance: if you go to a professional (not a place that does gun piercings), get quality jewelry, and care for them properly a lobe piercing should heal in 9 weeks and a helix in approximately 6 months. At that point you can't take a piercing out but you can change the jewelry.    Proper after care is either the LITHA or LIMA method.   LITHA: leave it the hell alone. No touching, turning, hitting, picking crusties off, pushing on, squeezing, submerging, or putting products of any kind on it. Shampoo from washing your hair is okay just rinse it off. Essentially do nothing at all.   LIMA: leave it mostly alone. So do the above but if the crusties/debris bother you you can use saline wound wash, from the wound care section, to soak your piercing 2-3 minutes twice a day. Do not pick the crusties, let them come off when soaking.  You can do a combination of the two.   You don't want to touch it because it causes tearing a swelling, turning it causes tearing and swelling plus debris to get inside, putting products on it or wearing crappy jewelry will cause irritation. All of which can lead to infection, rejection, and a bad time.   So... Professional piercer (not gun piercer), quality jewelry, and proper aftercare (essentially leaving it alone), and your piercing will be low maintenance."
piercing,3e3rst,turtlehana,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:35 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks a ton!
piercing,3e3rst,ema1237,3,Tue Jul 21 19:32:38 2015 UTC,Lobe piercings are very minimal and most employers don't seem to care. The pain is minor and the heal time is easy and quick. Ear piercings seem to be ok as long as they're not obnoxious. A lot of employers don't care for facial piercings but sometimes you can get away with it. Like I have my nose pierced and haven't had any problems with a stud.
piercing,3e3rst,PrioriIncantatem,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"It's totally subjective, but I've become a huge fan of a single lower helix piercing on men. It's a little more subversive and unique than a lobe, but still can be carried off with subtlety. Maybe a thin gold hoop after it heals? Man bun? 😀"
piercing,3e3rst,Ne0nBlur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a male with shoulder length hair, and I have 4 piercings (2 lip piercings and also both lobes, slightly stretched). Most piercings suit guys, although employers are usually pretty okay with almost all ear piercings, but not always with nose or lip/cheek piercings. Ear Lobes are pretty much the easiest piercings to get and are very easy when healing. Lip piercings are harder to heal, as they are constantly exposed to moving things (gum and tongue) although they rarely get infected due to the antibacterial properties of saliva. Ear Cartilage piercings and Nose piercings are somewhere in the middle when healing."
piercing,3e4sgr,RoyayGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"There is a process called scalpelling, which is what she might be talking about. But you can get your ears pierced with a larger gauge needle and start straight out at 6g if you want. It just all depends on what you and your piercer are comfortable with. I've never heard of scalpelling being dangerous, but I don't really know anything about it. There are others here who I'm sure will be able to help you out more."
piercing,3e4sgr,Susurro88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:37 2015 UTC,"I got mine done about 3 weeks ago, pierced with an 8g needle and then immediately stretched to a 6 with a taper.  The piercing wasn't bad but the stretching was really painful, glad I did it though they turned out great!"
piercing,3e4sgr,zirix88,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw a bunch of people on here with it and figured I'd ask since I'm going up to Toronto at the end of the month and have been trying to stretch for a while.

piercing,3e4xx9,chief_kweef,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:20 2015 UTC,"I thought if it was infected, I should take it out and clean it with salt water"
piercing,3e4xx9,chief_kweef,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:27 2015 UTC,"Even if it was infected, removing the piercing is the LAST thing you should do. It's irritated because you keep messing with it. It's only a week old, you need to keep your hands away from it.   What is your aftercare routine like?"
piercing,3e4xx9,chief_kweef,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:31:02 2015 UTC,"I got a bottle of this solution thing, the guy told me to squeeze a few drops on the top of the piercing about 3 times a day. Thats it"
piercing,3e4xx9,Graiid,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, follow that aftercare and stop messing with your piercing. If you feel like something is off, contact your piercer or stop back into the shop. The number one reason piercings have issues is because the piercee messes around with their piercing."
piercing,3e4xx9,Graiid,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"No. It is not infected.  You are not supposed to touch it or move it for a number of months. There is nothing to do to fix it except to stop touching it and keep up with your saline/salt soak ritual.    It does not heal quickly. You are essentially training your body to get used to metal being where it shouldn't be. Just like when you get a sliver or something, your body, initially wants to fight it. You keep it clean and happy, and you train it to go ""this is totally okay!"""

piercing,3e36vd,Gatorbait20,4,Tue Jul 21 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"14g may be more common in one-size-fits-all low quality mall jewelry, but all of the most reputable jewelry companies produce the same options in both sizes.  In fact, on safe, internally threaded jewelry, 12g and 14g will have the same thread pattern.  I know a lot of folks actually find the slightly thicker 12g bar more comfortable and less ""pinchy.""  If the piercer that did your tongue at 12g doesn't have a lot of options in stock, they can almost certainly order some for you.  You could also see if any of the shops listed on here are close to you: http://anatometal.com/shops/"
piercing,3e31ly,OhGodaUsername,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:42 2015 UTC,I don't think keeping it at 10g would be a problem. You might eventually want to stretch it though so you can get bigger end beads that don't slide down inside your urethra (that happens a LOT with curved barbells).
piercing,3e31ly,batquux,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:50 2015 UTC,The hole will naturally stretch itself a bit but unless it starts falling out or migrating there's not really any reason you have to go bigger.
piercing,3e31ly,ordinarilylazy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Had a PA for 8 months before converting to apadravya. I never HAD to stretch it. I was pierced at a 10 gauge CBR and once it was healed had it switched to a curved barbell with bigger balls on the ends so it wouldnt enter the urethra. I loved it at first. Everything was right in the sense that it fit perfectly, felt pretty awesome, and I could stand to pee. However it naturally stretched and the bar started to fit less well with stretching of both the urethral opening and the piercing due to the weight of the bigger balls on the end. It was signifcantly less comfortable and sometimes it was ""pinchy"". It got less easy to control my urine stream as well. I didnt really want to stretch it because I personally dont like the look of large gauge jewelry there. I went back to my piercer and she told me straight up that she personally dislikes PAs for the same reasons. She offered to convert it to an apadravya for me and I took her up on the offer. It wasnt much more painful than the PA and the pain lasted only a second. Since then its been a breeze. If you like the apa as well and dont want to worry about having to stretch it, id recommend that."
piercing,3e3wlo,viva_aviv,3,Tue Jul 21 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"I'd just make sure to go to a good piercer. I got mine done recently, and it didn't hurt at all. I didn't even think it was pierced for a second, literally no pain. The sweet spot is where it should be pierced, certainly no crunching. But there are also cool fake septum jewelry."
piercing,3e3wlo,ZenEnjoy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:13:48 2015 UTC,Go for it! There's really no reason not to. Especially now that you're older and smarter. Just don't skimp on the piercer or the jewelry and take care of it and you'll be fine.
piercing,3e3wlo,Pichus_Wrath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"If you're unsure the fake rings would be a good solution until you're ready to commit to it fully. They're cheep enough and easy to come by. If you like it then you can get it re-done again, if you get bored, no long healing time."
piercing,3e228e,Lilu9,3,Tue Jul 21 10:31:35 2015 UTC,"If this has been going on for a year, it may be worth it to make a day-trip to a reputable piecer outside your area. Or maybe even a doctor.  A piercing that is weeping and bleeding after a year clearly has something going on.   What type of jewelry do you have in it? Maybe it's moving too much to allow it to heal? How often are you cleaning it? Over cleaning can be very damaging."
piercing,3e228e,crossdog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming a doctor would tell me to just take them out, but I'm considering finding a piercer despite the long distance.  I have two BCR rings at the moment, and they work better than any of the others I've had (studs and simple rings). They don't get caught in my hair or anything.  I've tried not cleaning, cleaning a lot, and cleaning now and then and it doesn't seem to make a difference either way. It was only a few days ago that my one hole healed up, so progress at least."
piercing,3e228e,crossdog,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:38 2015 UTC,"Have you heard of the LITHA method? Aka ""leave it the hell alone"" method. Bodies are typically good at healing themselves. However, you may need antibiotics or medical intervention if this has been going on for a year.  Is the piercing site experiencing any other typical infection signs; redness, swelling, painful to the touch, inflamed, etc."
piercing,3e228e,NoxiousNyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I've been doing lately. The problem is the blood and pus keeps collecting underneath the scabs that appear and eventually pushes it away and I'm back to square one.  It's slightly pink normally with no swelling or inflammations, but red and warm after it's been bleeding etc. It is painful to touch however."

piercing,3e1qyl,sgt_eaglefort,4,Tue Jul 21 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you are at honestly. We are have to be aware and ready that attitudes are slowly shifting over time. I'm an American and I've been in Canada for three years now and I'm seeing it quiet different here than even when I was a kid twenty years ago. I've been in food establishments and even retailers where the person helping me or I just see them working and they have stretched ears, nose piercings, unusual hair styles. I think the most surprising one and the only one I didn't like was when I went into Costco and there was a young man had a dermal piercing (pretty sure cause it wasn't an anchor) and it wasn't very old because it was still bright red and looked kind of off.That's because I don't think you should get a fresh piercing then go right into work, but that's a person opinion.  But back to the issue at hand, as things change you'll find more places that will be accepting of it when it's possible. Have to keep in mind what is done for safety and what is being done out of conventionalism. Go in professionally, showcase you skills, your work ethic, and your ability to contribute to a company and your appearance shouldn't need to account for much.  I wish you all the best in your ventures~"

piercing,3dz64a,caffeinat,2,Mon Jul 20 22:54:03 2015 UTC,I definitely get what you're getting at. I apologize. Some people will have a super hard time. I wouldn't want someone to stress themselves out if it isn't easy for them. That would be awful.

piercing,3e0una,idont_haveballs,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"I know you don't want to go through the healing process again, but it's probably a good idea to atleast re do the newest one, id personally go get them both redone so the piercer can make sure they are both the same.   if you plan on doing the ring and stud combo more often id say keep them the way they are, as long as you're happy with the way it looks. but if you're gonna go with the other option, I'd personally get them both repierced. if you do t want to get both repierced, at least get the newest one re done, and MAKE SURE that you specify that you'll be doing two nostril studs and that you want them to look identical."
piercing,3e0una,TreyN7,0,Tue Jul 21 02:41:36 2015 UTC,That's good advice and I will definitely consider those options. But I hear that nose piercings don't really close after you've had them for a while... If I get them both redone will I just have an extra hole on the right or is the not closing thing a myth?
piercing,3e0una,TreyN7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"they usually close, If left for a long time they'll leave a little crater, like lip piercings do."

Your breasts are tender and sore for about a week after and you have to be careful and sometimes they snag on your bra which hurts a bit but after that first week the healing process is pretty quick. After about a month or 2 you enter a stage where a bit of whitish yellowish puss oozes from the holes which is a little gross but totally normal and a healthy sigh that they are healing correctly. You want to buy wound wash and clean the piercings daily for the first few weeks to prevent infection. I'm very happy with them and they've boosted my confidence a ton!"
piercing,3dzcmn,Ewrong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I've been researching and I plan to get it done this week. I've had other things pierced but for some reason I keep stressing myself about the nipple piercing.
piercing,3dzcmn,babifblss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing. I didn't even get it done because I wanted to!

Then she showed my other co-worker who decided to get it done the next day at the same place! They were like you HAVE to do it! Turns out my bf at the time, his dad owns the shop and offered to pay half the cost of piercing and jewelry for me so I went in 2 days later and did it because I never do anything adventurous. Now I'm so happy I did. Just hold your breath during the actual piercing and brace yourself, and take motrin 30 mins before."
piercing,3dzcmn,givoly,4,Mon Jul 20 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"Holding your breath during the actual piercing is a really good way to get yourself to pass out, it's not a good idea. A long slow exhale during the piercing helps to prevent that."
piercing,3dzcmn,givoly,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"Different things work for different people. I held my breath the moment before each piercing went through and slowly let go the moment it was over. It was probably about 5 seconds, not long enough to make you pass out."

piercing,3dxg26,Aneurhythmia,0,Mon Jul 20 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"Soaking is used/recommended to remove crusties and to draw out any debris more than anything though, not necessarily to clean the piercings I believe. Warm water and/or saline helps to soften crusties so they can fall off by themselves while submerged in the solution, and it's usually recommended to rinse the piercing with water afterwards to remove any leftover saline so your skin doesn't dry out from it."

piercing,3dw3jz,GooberMcTitties,8,Mon Jul 20 00:45:18 2015 UTC,"First off, make sure you are going to a legit shop. Nowhere that uses guns or allows teenagers to pierce people after watching a ""training video.""  Pain from the piercing is a little pinch, nothing big. Make sure you eat something beforehand, some people experience a drop in blood sugar when getting pierced (especially if it is their first one, and it doesn't matter how tough you are). Healing will take about a year to be fully healed (and this is with everything going according to plan, no snagging, smacking, irritation bumps happening), you should be able to safely have jewelry changed by a piercer after about 6ish months, but honestly the longer you leave it alone at first the better it will go.   This is how I deal with all new piercings: You'll want to get some sterile saline wash from the drug store and spray the front and back of the piercing 2x daily for at least the first week or so and then just when you get out of the shower for another couple weeks. After that I just leave them completely alone unless there is a big build up of crusties and then I will spray them off with the sterile saline. Your body knows how to heal itself, don't start using tea tree oil, soap, or anything harsh on it to ""clean it"". Just keep the area clean, rinse well in the shower before getting out, and it will do it's thing.  You will want a straight labret stud in for the initial jewelry, they heal much better because of less movement and irritation. Also, make sure you're getting quality jewelry put in, not some $0.10 piece of junk from China. Implant grade titanium is really the best.   I honestly don't notice piercings on people unless they've got something huge and flashy and I doubt that anyone will really treat you differently if you have a single helix piercing. I'm a girl with like 11 piercings and 6 tattoos and no one really says anything to me other than, ""I love your tattoo(s)!"" or ""I love your earrings."""

There is a piercer at a tattoo shop near my school that a few of my friends have visited before and from what I hear he is the guy to see, so I am not too worried about the legitimacy of the shop, but what would be some red flags to look for? Also, should I be cautious when taking showers or anything like that for the first few months following the piercing?"
piercing,3dw3jz,Susurro88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"Ask them what brand of jewelry they use, ask if they have implant grade titanium jewelry. Find out if they use only internally threaded jewelry, if they tell you they use ""surgical steel"" or that they have externally threaded jewelry those are huge red flags and should not be trusted. I've lived in a college town for a while and just because everyone goes to a shop doesn't mean they're legit or someone I would trust with my body."
piercing,3dw3jz,dwarfgourami,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy who just got my first piercing, a helix, a couple months ago. Don't expect for it to be fully healed in less than 6 months. Getting pierced didn't hurt very much, but it stings pretty badly when you knock it against your shirt or hairbrush or something. I still can't touch my piercing without it stinging, 3 months after I got it pierced. If you notice anything unusual with your piercing, like a bump, research what the problem is ASAP. I haven't been treated any differently at all, but I go to a pretty tolerant and liberal school, so it probably depends on your environment.   EDIT: Tips I forgot to add: eat something before you get your piercing, and for the first couple days use a pillowcase you don't care about in case there's a little blood."
piercing,3dw3jz,dwarfgourami,2,Mon Jul 20 01:19:04 2015 UTC,"How do you like the piercing if you don't mind me asking? Any regrets with it? What kind of jewelry did you get? I go to a pretty liberal university as well, so I probably shouldn't worry too much about people judging me, but it is nice to hear you have had a good experience with it!"
piercing,3dw3jz,Hermit9,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:19 2015 UTC,"I love it! I'm planning on getting another helix piercing right below or above it when I get my nose pierced in October. The only thing I regret is touching my piercing so much the first couple days after I got it. I have a plain straight barbell, which is definitely necessary until it heals. I can't imagine how much more frustrating healing would be if I had gotten a hoop at first."
piercing,3dw3jz,TheSunnyWade,2,Mon Jul 20 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"IMHO helix looks good on everyone. But I might be biased as I have 3 in my left ear.  Regarding the ring/barbell thing : I work in a fairly corporate environment so I wanted discreet jewelry. I healed all 3 piercings with Black anodized niobium seamless rings. The second one was very angry at me about this and was very easy to irritate. They are fully healed now but I have little doubt that I could have made my life easier with different jewelry.  Also, if you have a SO, expect a few days of training them to avoid that ear when they touch your hair/face."
piercing,3dw3jz,MegatronShotFirst,2,Mon Jul 20 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"I just got my helix done last Wednesday (so, not even a week ago) so the experience is pretty fresh in my mind.  The pain was minimal.  It doesn't hurt unless bumped.  I'm VERY careful with my hair (long hair) and tie it back almost constantly.  I try to be super cautious of it, but you do forget about it pretty easily.  I only sleep on the opposite side (tough to do for a flip-flopp side sleeper).  I love the piercing and I'm sure you will too! I'm also the type that practices the LITFA method-leave it the fuck alone.  I don't spray it, wash it or soak it.  I let the hot water run over it in the shower and always make sure that's the last thing I do before I get out (so soap bubbles are not left on it). Good luck!  And don't forget to post a pic after you do it!"
piercing,3dw3jz,S-E,0,Mon Jul 20 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"If you want it, get it done and forget everyone else. My first piercing was my ear lobe when I was 13, around 1992. I got my helix piercing in December 2011. I just got my septum pierced three weeks ago.  The piercing doesn't really hurt, just a pinch.  Get starter jewelry you like, because it's going to be there for about 6 months.  You will get it caught when putting on shirts, this hurts the most and you learn quickly to pull the collar out to make room.  It's pretty easy to take care of. Just keep it clean, and like all piercings don't touch it.  This may be controversial advice, but I went to Claires for my helix.  It's convenient and I think a helix is hard to mess up.  Just check out the piercer at the store beforehand, or go to an APP piercer at a tattoo place.  It's your choice.   I've never noticed if people treat me differently with or without my piercings.  Although I go for a minimalistic look anyways.    Basically, if you want to get it done.  Just get it done, you'll be happier which is all that matters."
piercing,3dwpza,asusan,3,Mon Jul 20 04:10:52 2015 UTC,How old are the piercings? How we're they pierced? And what material is the jewelry you're wearing?  More than likely you're just facing reactions to the materials.
piercing,3dwpza,babifblss,0,Mon Jul 20 12:45:46 2015 UTC,They're about two months. I went to Clair's and had them pierced with a gun. I was wearing the starter earrings when it first happened.
piercing,3dwpza,bella26piano,2,Tue Jul 21 04:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think I may see the problem here...you've had a pointy earring stud shot through your ear four times now? There's going to be some scar tissue there. And although it's possible it's been infected, it's much more likely that you are having a reaction to cheap metals. I recommend having a reputable piercer switch you over to implant grade titanium and for aftercare, rinse it only with sterile saline solution. Hopefully the irritation will subside soon."
piercing,3dwpza,babifblss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:32 2015 UTC,Where do you suggest I go to get these earrings? And do you think sea salt will help it a little with the irritation? Also would only my left ear be irritated? Sorry if I ask alot. 😥
piercing,3dx12m,whosdoug,2,Mon Jul 20 06:13:11 2015 UTC,"Depending on how much it swells it might be uncomfortable to move your lip around and forming a tight 'O', but it should not have any impact at all on your ability to just growl your head off. Happy yelling."

piercing,3dv7lz,poutinethrowawayx,0,Mon Jul 20 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"I've posted about this before and while yes, BAF is a thing.  There is a lot to risk by not using a professional. Most high quality companies back their product with a lifetime guarantee, so in ten years if a stone were to come loose, you could replace it no cost or have it fixed. With BAF, no such thing exists since most of these companies only deal wholesale, you have no shop to go back to with your issue. Then, you also run into the potential of ordering the wrong size. Once again, places like BAF do not do returns or exchanges once you've opened if where a professional will actually measure your piece to ensure it fits before ordering or installing. The list goes on. But at the end of the day. Use a professional, that's why they're there."
piercing,3dv7lz,tveir,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:20:04 2015 UTC,"All I said is that you don't have to go through a professional to buy custom jewelry, which is true. I didn't claim it was better than going to a piercer or that you shouldn't go to a piercer ever for custom jewelry. For most standard piercings, BAF is fine and sizing is easy. I've bought countless items from them and their customer service is great and they always fix any issues that arise with my orders. Just because it's not an option you use doesn't mean no one should. I'll keep buying my shit there, thanks."
piercing,3dv7lz,poutinethrowawayx,-3,Mon Jul 20 05:36:18 2015 UTC,"Be as upset about it as you'd like (Thanks). But whether or not you said they should or shouldn't, recommending BAF as an alternative to a professional detracts from the industry. People self diagnose instead of seeing a doctor, and many end up dead because of their ignorance. Because you can manage something on your own, doesn't mean you should. Simply because you haven't had problems - that you know of - ordering your own jewelry, doesn't mean you're doing it right. Immune systems are a glorious thing. And while you didn't directly say NOT to go to a professional, professionals exist for a reason. Utilize them."
piercing,3dv7lz,tveir,0,Mon Jul 20 05:43:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, what an escalation. Now I'm apparently telling people to self diagnose medical problems."
piercing,3dv7lz,poutinethrowawayx,-3,Mon Jul 20 05:50:35 2015 UTC,Ignorance is ignorance. No matter the situation.
piercing,3dv7lz,tveir,2,Mon Jul 20 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but there are plenty of ignorant ""professionals"" out there as well. My nearest APP piercer is 5 hours away and there are at least 10 shops in my city alone using improper jewelry and techniques, and most of them are bustling with business. So telling someone to ""go to a professional"" has it's own set of risks, just like telling someone to order from BAF. Here's hoping that OP doesn't make their way to a ""professional"" who's going to fit them with a custom piece of acrylic/surgical steel bullshit. It comes down to doing your own research. You have to already know your shit if you're going to get pierced, or you're going to get preyed upon by this widely unregulated industry. If you happen to know the length/gauge/material you need, ordering jewelry from BAF isn't going to be a huge deal."
piercing,3dv7lz,poutinethrowawayx,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:20 2015 UTC,"There certainly are self proclaimed professionals  that suck, however there are plenty of non APP piercers that are more than qualified if you don't happen to be near one. Especially when you consider that being APP doesn't mean you're good at your job, it just means you meet an industry created minimum standard of operation. So, APP although in many situations is a plus, it certainly isn't a prerequisite. However, if OP were to - for example - to use the Anato site to find a retailer than you both bypass BAF, for obvious reasons, and can go to a shop you know orders from a quality company. The only thing it requires from the client is the ability to spot crap from quality. There are even shops that run online stores so even if you're so dead set on measuring your own anatomy for your jewelry, you can support a professional AND maintain your lifetime guarantee -  which once again - isn't a thing you'd get from BAF. You can continue to run yourself in circles but, fact is, BAF sucks."

piercing,3dus7y,Las_papas,3,Sun Jul 19 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"I had mine done about 6 years ago. The pain wasn't bad, I had an excellent professional doing it. Healing did take quite awhile but I am also slow to heal. I may be wrong but I also feel like cartilage piercings take a bit longer for healing as is. I  never had trouble with keloids myself, but I was diligent with my recommended care. It was difficult sleeping for the first few months because it was tender and the jewelry took some getting used to. If you're a female with long hair I'd be mindful of keeping it put of the way as best as possible. There were a few clumsy moments of me brushing my hair and I snagged it which hurt like hell. Overall I personally didn't struggle much with it. I'd recommend going back when they tell you to swap out jewelry when the swelling goes down. Because a super long bar becomes quite the hazard. It required more patience but I love mine because I can wear a bar or two separate pieces.  Also search for a good professional in your area! APP certified is good to look for and quality jewelry is an absolute must for any piercing! There are people on here who can point you in the right direction if you pm your general area to them they can help locate that for you."
piercing,3dus7y,ThatWhatISaid,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"You likely won't develop keloids, but irritation bumps (which majority of people get) are probably what you're thinking about.  First off, industrials are very anatomy dependent, find a studio that understands this. Next, make sure you're dealing with only implant grade titanium. If they can't offer you mill certificates it's NOT implant grade and shouldn't be in your body. They'll take a good 9-12 months to heal assuming you don't run into any trouble. Long hair can certainly cause issues, you just need to be diligently careful."
piercing,3dus7y,babifblss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for two months now, and (touch wood) it really hasn't been as bad as I'd feared. Just a small irritation bump, no pain beyond the first week or two and only one true hair tangling incident.  I have long hair as well, but the one time I got my hair tangled in it was because the bar was pushed right 'up' so that there was about a centimetre of the bar exposed at the top of my ear. If I have it centred or pushed 'down' it's not an issue."
piercing,3dus7y,whatktdid,0,Sun Jul 19 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"I got mine 7 years ago, and it took 5 months to heal. I soaked it in water mixed with sea salt 2x a day and eventually switched to just spraying it with H2Ocean (salt water spray). The upper hole had a bump next to it for a few months but that went away by the 5-month mark. I might have gotten a minor infection during the healing process because I remember a time when my piercing was itchy and warm, but it went away and I've never had an infection since. I have long hair too, which hasn't been a problem. I'd say don't switch jewelry until it's healed - maybe my ears are just in between sizes (my bar is 1 & 1/4 inches), but I didn't have to change jewelry to accommodate for swelling in the beginning. Good luck!"
piercing,3dus7y,Grouplover,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for over 10 years and the healing process wasn't that bad. If it hurts to sleep on it, you can take a towel, shape it into a donut and put your ear in the centre. If you have long hair, just be a bit more careful. It's easy to get your hair wrapped around the ends of the end of the barbell."
piercing,3dus7y,nneighbour,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:14:52 2015 UTC,I've had mine pierced for about 5 years or so. It was the most painful piercing that I've had. The piercer sucked though and I bled like crazy. It took about 1 year to heal.
