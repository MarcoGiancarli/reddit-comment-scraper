Also, I guess the Loyalists' similarities to the Nazi regime can be attributed to just the totalitarian regime that it is. I say this because the Nazis' big focal point, in a manner of speaking, is nationalism and the hyping of the German culture and people. So in this framework of thinking, it can be the Loyalists' goal to preserve the human race by surviving through submitting themselves to the Observers? Just a thought"
fringe,3dsipe,Benny-JetOwner,4,Sun Jul 19 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively sure they address this in season 5 - September/Donald explains how Observers are 'born' - they're grown. Since they're Observers, they don't see any need to grow two different types of Observer. Why bother?  No emotions means no real connections between males and females, so they just ended up all being men."

You could basically say the same about Lost, it uses a long time to tell a back story to all of the characters.. Fringe also took forever to explain things..   Personal/Political? Are you talking about the LGBT themes? They play a big role yes, especially in the start, but that's only two out of the 8 characters. The 6 other characters deals with a lot of other somewhat typical themes like problems in Africa, taking drugs, problems with your family (especially father-son/daughter), problems with love, crime and losing loved ones. Just look at the whole Riley story at the end of the season.   But it is a series that's pretty slow, and all the real action doesn't really happen until the 4th episode.. The last episode shows that the build up was worth it in the end though, in my opinion."

It's about an AI which prevents violent crimes. It sends social security numbers to its operatives. It was designed to stop acts of terrorism after 9/11. But it sees everything. So the creator (Mr. Finch) had to divide those numbers into 2 lists (relevant and irrelevant). Government gets relevant numbers (the primary functions), Finch and his partner, Mr. Reese, get irrelevant numbers (secondary operations, or Contingency protocol), and there's also tertiary, but that's a whole different story. The catch is, they don't know if the numbers are the victim or perpetrator. They only know something's going to happen within 48 hours. Oh, and the Machine cares about humanity.   Then the series gets totally insane, though I won't spoil."

Why they chose 2015 to invade isn't clear; perhaps they can only go back so far, and they needed a planet they could bring up to their needed CO2 levels quickly (but presumably not so bad that they'll have to leave again).  Of course they were changing the future by changing the past, but that sort of timeline-changing was established in season 4.  Not really sure what more reason you're looking for.

There's a longer explanation for why it exists and why it wasn't aired during season 1, but the short version is that it was deliberately written not to advance the plot so it could safely be pulled from the schedule.  (Long version involves the number of episodes ordered and whether the pilot counted as 1 or 2, versus the number of air dates Fox had slotted for it in the first season. The production company decided they needed to produce one more episode to fulfill their contractual obligations, so ""Unearthed"" was produced after the season 1 finale, but never really intended to air or go anywhere in particular.)"

Although it's definitely showing it's age, so much of the earlier seasons still hold up as some of the best Sci-Fi/Mystery TV there is.  It has a very similar starting premise, FBI agents investigating paranormal cases, although the overarching storyline deals with aliens rather than parallel universes.    The last couple seasons kinda drop the ball, but the early and mid seasons are fantastic.  It's also coming back next year for a small season, so it would be a perfect time to check it out if you haven't yet."

I've watched a few other shows though since then that have been pretty good. I definitely recommend Netflix's new original series, Sens8. It does a lot of very in depth and drawn out story and character building, so it can take a few episodes to start to understand and really get into it. It absolutely blew me away. Very well thought out and put together. It's an absolute must watch!!"

fringe,3clohx,sirbruce,3,Thu Jul 9 10:52:57 2015 UTC,"You got it.  No, the writers wrote themselves into a stupid corner by ending season 3 that way and spent all of season 4 writing themselves out of it.  The Olivia thing was absolutely lazy and they'll do a little more of it in season 5.  It really kinda took a dump over all the characters we loved in the previous 3 seasons, too, but the writers had to come up with a way to put Peter and Olivia together finally.  As I said, season 3 is the high point of the show.  Season 5 is very much an add-on, really a different show, but it does eventually wrap up several of the loose plot threads from earlier in the series."

The last season of Fringe definitely felt very different than everything before it but at least it was still pretty good."

Was it the time travel, the flashforwards or flash-sideways? And I think the finale was good. And I didn't have PSD (Post-series depression) afterwards because it was exactly the closure I needed.  Fringe went way off course towards the end, with the Observers taking action. I lost interest when they were trying to bang waitresses but I stuck with it, and I wasn't disappointed. But the finale was open-ended, leaving many loose ends. Not that it wasn't good, though, it was fantastic."

The first season is a bit less good than I remember (particularly the first half), but hey, it's finding its footing.  I agree with /u/SisterBubbles - I'm surprised about the fact that Olivia has no recognition of Walter.  Peter, I get it, but surely she recognizes Walter's face.  Anyone know at what point the writers determined the arc of the show? I'd totally forgotten about the episode with the feral Observer child!  Also, about how 'evil' Massive Dynamic is in every episode!  Goodness, this is a good show."

Walter: 92 percent of caucasian newborns have blue eyes. looks at Peter -Yours were green. The camera shows Peters face, and he very clearly have BLUE eyes  It was at that exact moment that i had the thought (and this is without having any idea what Fringe is about mind you) that Peter must be from another universe. (Imagine my smugness when it turned out that i was right xD )  So i think that the story-arc was cemented as early as episode 2 (i believe that the first observer can be found in that episode, in the hospital), but that is just my two sense worth."

fringe,3bfxy3,MadKraken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"I took it as there was an invisible entrance to the pocket dimension that required you to know where it was and what direction to move into it from. Walter's dance was just his method of remembering how to get in, because Walter."
fringe,3bcsvd,lambros009,9,Sun Jun 28 00:16:38 2015 UTC,"Also in the episode where William bell is residing in olivias conscience, there is a man in her mind she says is trying to kill her, they never followed up on that!"

fringe,3bcsvd,Karjalan,5,Sun Jun 28 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"I remember an interview where it was said that if they would've had more time in season 5, and Leonard Nimoy would've came back, then the explanation would've been that the man was actually going to kill William Bell. He was actually in Bell's mind, not Olivia's, which explains why he was self-aware, when everyone else they encounter  (Nina, Brandon, Olivia's step-father), were just mindless killing zombies. She just misinterpreted it as being about her.   When that never happened, the official answer became that the man represented Bell since he was indirectly responsible for Olivia's death. I've been looking for the interview (I'm pretty sure it was with tvguide), but these two have been the closest I could find."

fringe,3bcsvd,salahadinraven,4,Sat Jul 4 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think that the closest thing to an explanation you'll get about the cylinder is in ""A Short Story About Love"" (4x15) and ""The Boy Must Live"" (5x11).They pretty much just help the Observers locate a specific place and time. Fringe was pretty good about answering most of its questions, though. The biggest thing that I can think of is that there isn't much of an explanation of the green and red lights, other than the fact that they can be used to hypnotize people. Similar to Lost, you can Google ""fringe unanswered questions"" and find lists that fans have come up with, but the lists are a lot shorter for Fringe than for Lost, and with both shows, some of the ""unanswered"" questions do actually receive an explanation if you pay close enough attention."

fringe,3bcsvd,gregbard,6,Sun Jun 28 09:05:20 2015 UTC,Lots of unresolved plot lines.  The writers didn't really know what they were doing.  Nina and Broyles kissing is another one.
fringe,3bcsvd,sirbruce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"Every major Fringe event was explained and used against the Observers. The cylinders are basically Observer technology.  William Bell timeline just disappeared and never came back after his plan to make another Universe was ruined. Maybe he was erased?  Also, there is no other timeline, the original one was reset and the only ones who remember it are Peter, Olivia, David Robert Jones and Walter."

Then they just tell her to look around crazily during both shots, blinking here and there, etc."

fringe,3a5371,pillarofthedirt,2,Wed Jun 17 08:09:18 2015 UTC,"This is all just pure speculation on my part, but from what I've seen, they're not at all related. Milo's ability came from crazy number-crunching, calculating all possible probabilities. This was visualized by a fractal display of all the possible situations.  Season 5 spoilers: When Peter implanted the observer device in his neck, he gained the ability to see multiple time lines. It looked like he was peeking into actual alternate realities (although he talked about variables, probabilities, and getting Windmark onto the right path, like Milo). . There's also instances in which September talks bout looking at all possible futures, giving the impression that he views those futures on some sort of screen."
fringe,3a5371,Mantis_Pantis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:41:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it was speculation on my part too.  When I saw Milo looking at possibilities on a screen in his mind it made me think if I'd missed the link.  As well as his sister saying that he was becoming less and less emotion-based which was another similarity.  Good episode in any case."
fringe,3a2equ,kentuckyfriedpete_za,5,Tue Jun 16 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"I thought that what changed is that September never saved Peter from falling through the ice. Walter still crossed over to try to save Peter, ripping a hole between universes. He still experimented on children (including Olivia) to try to cross over safely. And so Walternate would still want to keep Olivia and experiment how she can cross over, and it's best to do that with the enemy (our fringe team) not knowing, hence the faux-livia switch."
fringe,3a2equ,stoopidemu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:02:51 2015 UTC,But why did Olivia go over in the first place. Modern day I mean. The theater /operah part. When William bell uses the grenade and faux livia is swaps with ours. Real Olivia was over there to save Peter. What is the reasoning for her being there this time
fringe,3a2equ,stoopidemu,2,Tue Jun 16 21:52:46 2015 UTC,Walternate had been sending over shapeshifters. It was only a matter of time before they crossed over. I can think of many justifications. Perhaps it was a recon mission. Perhaps it was to confront bell after he had pulled her across. Perhaps it was a mission to bring bell back for some reason. Who knows?
fringe,3a2equ,stoopidemu,2,Tue Jun 16 22:00:54 2015 UTC,True they were looking for bell all along and they had just been made aware of where he truly was around that time during the season in the normal timeline.
fringe,3a2equ,CarolineTurpentine,4,Tue Jun 16 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"The erasing Peter plot point was handled in a way that made the timeline very confusing to figure out. I've rewatched maybe 7 or 8 times. I can come up with justifications. It would have been nice if some of the larger plot holes could have been explained better in show though. It was inelegant, and in the next season almost completely dropped (except for, if I remember correctly, one passing reference from Walter)."
fringe,3a2equ,sirbruce,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:09:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say how she got over there in the new timeline, but so many other things have changed. We know that they didn't use the theatre to go over so presumably the reasoning for her going over is different as well. For all we know Walternate had her kidnapped or something."
