RedDwarf,3d6b6b,Lord_Meowington,8,Mon Jul 13 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I can think of a few things where Lister has tried to make an effort to be friendly, but nothing where it goes both ways off the top of my head. There's a scene in season 8 where they're being reprimanded by Hollister, and they sort of snigger towards each other like a pair of schoolboys sharing a joke. And Lister does give Rimmer his memories of Lisa Yates to try and cheer him up. When Rimmer has that argument with himself in Me2, it's Lister that he goes to, rather than be alone.    I always had the impression that Lister felt kind of sorry for Rimmer, because he felt like they actually could have been friends if Rimmer wasn't such an insufferable prat.     This was one thing that stuck out to me a bit in Back To Earth. Lister doesn't seem the least bit upset or even slightly conflicted when Katerina gives Rimmer 24 hours before she erases him. I kind of expected... something? Even just resignation."
RedDwarf,3d6b6b,VampireCake,3,Tue Jul 14 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. There are times when there is... Something... Between them but it's crowded out with the other negative things. In season 7 Rimmer goes off to do his Ace impression. Lister helps him get the confidence. At 'Rimmers' funeral and just after there seems to be that connection."
RedDwarf,3d6b6b,rssvitamins,8,Tue Jul 14 07:00:31 2015 UTC,"From what I remember early in season 7, Chris Barrie's future as Rimmer wasn't set in stone as he was considering leaving the show  Edit: Found this   At the same time, Chris Barrie had expressed serious concerns about reprising his Rimmer role. Production problems on the last two series, the technical difficulties inherent in shooting the show, plus his success with The Brittas Empire on BBC1, made returning to Red Dwarf less enticing than it had once been."
RedDwarf,3d6b6b,ExecutiveChimp,3,Mon Jul 13 22:57:29 2015 UTC,I believe it was more that he had chosen not to be in series 7 from the beginning but that they roped him in to a couple of episodes to give him a good send-off.

Actually, it's a good example of how we sometimes get the perfect casting and never even realize it. The American pilots were pretty literal translations of the original, but they still fell completely flat and just didn't work."
RedDwarf,3c5xr7,Neveronlyadream,12,Sun Jul 5 05:57:05 2015 UTC,"Comedy styling also doesn't translate well literally from British to American. The reason The Office worked so well is because they pretty much just kept the name and ran with it how they wanted to.   I remember Danny John Jules talking about it on a DVD extra and one of the American actors of the US Red Dwarf came up to him and said 'Hey did you see the pilot, what did you think?' to which he replied 'Well you're American what did you think?' He didn't have an answer because he knew it was shit himself."
RedDwarf,3c5xr7,Jungle2266,21,Sun Jul 5 13:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is between British and American humour. British humour is very self depricating. Our best comedy characters are idiots, failures, or slobs. American characters tend to be successful, wisecracking, charismatic people.  The US Lister was in the US style, which totally doesn't fit RD at all."
RedDwarf,3c5xr7,Fallenangel152,14,Sun Jul 5 08:07:54 2015 UTC,Stephen Fry explains this pretty well
RedDwarf,3c5xr7,Jungle2266,7,Sun Jul 5 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the show really.  Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm are very self-deprecating, successful shows and perhaps that's why I like Red Dwarf and Peep Show so much."
RedDwarf,3c5xr7,CelestialFury,6,Sun Jul 5 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"This is very much my take on it. I even disagree with some of what Stephen says in the link provided in a comment near your own comment.  Blackadder after the first series is an example of the confident swaggering hero who talks his way out of situations. Starting with the second series look at how often he manages to get out of scrapes. Of course even in the third and fourth series he doesn't win at every possible thing he does, but that's because it'd be boring. Still he continues with a majority of successes.  The USA is littered with the lovable loser hero trope or just outright losers. Going to older series, Fred Sanford never got rich. (unlike Del Boy in the UK) Al Bundy never advanced his career or marriage. Arrested Development seemed to be all about failures. Pretty much all of Norman Lear's comedies were around people who were either treated fairly evenly or usually failed. Even the characters in 'Friends' failed quite a lot and were often seen as socially inept. Even Gilligan generally only succeeded by accident, and he was very self-deprecating.  Truthfully, I think that this pilot failed because it wasn't terribly good and executives lacked faith in it. (though I don't find it as bad for a pilot as other people do. pilots are usually fairly bad to be honest)   edit: whoops, that went on longer than I meant."

The first few seasons were remastered in the 90s, and I recall being disappointed with the effects (particularly Blue Midget's legs) when they aired on my local PBS station.

Unlike the US, pretty much the only things shot on film in the 80s and before were dramas, and even then it was usually 16mm unless it had a big budget.  Most sitcoms had 16mm inserts for outdoor scenes, but seeing as Red Dwarf had very few of these, that wasn't needed. When they did start going outside in Series 2 and 3, video cameras were a bit more portable.  Most shows were still using 16mm outside at this point but BBC Manchester did things their own way and everything for Red Dwarf was shot on video. EXCEPT maybe, some of the model shots, which might have been done on 16mm but I'm not sure."

According to his story, he nearly called his lawyer, when Red Dwarf went in an entirely different way that Star Trek ever would have, and he became an instant fan.  As for the arcs, it really depends on who is writing, and what their goals are.  Grant Naylor did an excellent of borrowing tropes and ideas from other fiction, then turning it on its head for Red Dwarf.  Sometimes, you got a lesson out of it, like ""Camille"" or ""Meltdown"", and other times it was just silly, like ""Confidence and Paranoia"", and in still others it was just a blatant rip-off, like ""Back to Earth""."

I thought series X was just like finding more 3-6 episodes only with more modern special effects and the actors are older."

RedDwarf,38nscj,platoandfriends,8,Fri Jun 5 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Let me try to sell it to you. Here are ten (sometimes related) reasons I think it's a great idea:   They have the money, for the first time in a long time. That means studio audiences, sets, guests, and so on.  They have a number of older revamped scripts, like the classic lost cat episode and 'four Krytens'.  They're all free now, and dedicated to RD. Craig quit Corrie for it, and that's a big deal, so he has consciously chosen to return to RD not just for a one off but as the focus of his career. They've all done other stuff and come back to RD. This is related to the next few: They did 7-8 in the late 90s when they were all distracted and they'd really run out of juice in RD years earlier, and got sick of each other in that time. Craig in particular was really screwed up, whereas he's now a lot more sanguine. They've found a new appreciation for the show and their buddies over the years, as you'll know if you've been to the Cons/Dimension Jump and met them. They're all old. This makes something like RD even funnier because they're all past-its. It can add a new level of humour that RD hinted at before. BTE was wrong, as was 8. That's a good thing. They know the boundaries, and they know what they did wrong. The show survived, and now we can move forward wiser. They want to return to the original, clean, structure. The return to the fundamentals of the show is a great thing, and to some extent they can sweep away some of the cluttered lore from the later seasons by returning to this format. They have lots of new ideas. All of them. Doug and the other back end staff, and the actors. They've all got new directions that they want the show to go in, and they're not looking to wrap it up (like BTE and possibly 8 were). They want the show to go on to future seasons.   I don't want to make you feel bad for not wanting new seasons. I just want to give you some food for thought. Your opinion is your own buddy. My own personal opinion is that season 1 is the best, and I'm the minority here! : )"
RedDwarf,38nscj,schad501,3,Sat Jun 6 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"7 and 8 were all about getting ready to make the movie. 9 was, as you said, about putting the series out to pasture. X was a return to the pre-7 days. Not perfect, but pretty solid."
RedDwarf,38nscj,platoandfriends,7,Sat Jun 6 05:34:41 2015 UTC,"I think some of the X episodes were actually not just good but RD classics - some of the best RD we've seen. That's pretty amazing for a show that's just returned after a shaky short, with actors who haven't played their roles properly in over a decade. I think we can expect great things from 12.  The most important thing is that the atmosphere is right. I don't know if you guys were at DJ recently, but the cast and Doug were all in exactly the right place. You could just tell."

I really enjoyed Back in the Red, and I thought the Pete episodes were quite funny, having Rimmer and Lister constantly aggravating Hollister. :D I will say that I'm still not sure about the rest of the episodes. Series 8 seemed to rely a lot on sex and gender humor, which can be funny, but that was never really the dynamic RD had before. It also seemed to get a lot more blatant and lowbrow - at least to me, ""double polaroid"" is extremely funny, but Archie is not. The Archie scenes' dialogue was too predictable, and they fell into that weird, unfunny void of being simultaneously too deadpan and too over-the-top. It just didn't really work for me. But definitely Series 8 has some awesome gems, particularly the bunk scenes, and some really excellent new characters with Kill Crazy and ""Nicey"" Ackerman! :)"

RedDwarf,362hur,TomTheGeek,15,Fri May 15 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"You have Ace Rimmer for that kind of role for Barrie, don't you? Well it is not exactly the same as you describe, still we got another version of Rimmer that is sort of comparable to what you describe.  I think the things are okay as they are - rimmer being pedantic but not capable, and lister being capable but lazy. It is a charming duo as they are :D"
RedDwarf,362hur,volca02,6,Fri May 15 15:33:15 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love the chemistry and all. ""rimmer being pedantic but not capable, and lister being capable but lazy."" sums it up very nicely. Worked for me for some decades now, and still going strong."

Anyway - what kind of rimmer would you put next to that kind of lister?"
RedDwarf,362hur,dunzie,11,Fri May 15 18:09:30 2015 UTC,For me that's the whole point of Rimmer though.  He is a complete failure at almost everything he does but he tries oh so hard not to be.  He is the pinnacle of all he can be and that's nothing.  Tragic but fucking hilarious and imho perfect for Barrie.  There is Bodyswap though where the swap you talk about does happen.  Interesting episode.
RedDwarf,362hur,dunzie,10,Fri May 15 16:10:36 2015 UTC,"I like the episode, but I am totally distracted by the voices. I am sure it is the best they could do at that time and the technology, and also I just can't accept that they also swapped voices. Yes it was the point of the identification for the self destruct deactivation, but I just don't get it.  And I get what you're saying. Rimmer is all looks and attire but no brains, especially in Bodyswap it's shown with a fancy new suit (""Because I am that smeghead Rimmer"" poke)."

I'm very hopeful."

RedDwarf,3478c1,breakingcups,3,Wed Apr 29 07:29:41 2015 UTC,I can thoroughly recommend The Man in the Rubber Mask. It's a great little read about Robert as he started out and his time on Red Dwarf.

RedDwarf,342mft,Onesielover88,2,Mon May 4 01:20:55 2015 UTC,"YES!!!! Saturday was the best day of my entire smeggin' life! :D Seriously, going to DJ was the best decision I have ever made, and I will never miss another one! I got to dance with Hattie Hayridge; Chris Barrie gave me a glass of wine and chatted with me; I made Robert Llewellyn bust out laughing in an autograph session! And the other attendees are the absolute warmest, friendliest people I have ever met - I'm on my way home with 20 new Facebook friends, a new online community, and so many compliments and memories that I was crying with joy on the bus ride to the airport. I'm getting misty again just thinking about it. :D Seriously, it's the greatest experience I have ever had!  Oh, and of course I was there for Doug Naylor's announcement, and I got to do a coffee session with him and get his autograph too! Best day ever!"

Too many questions to function and format correctly.. Tell me ALL!!! (please) xD"
RedDwarf,342mft,Onesielover88,2,Tue May 5 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, you’re going to regret asking that! I started telling people about DJ on my way home from the airport, and after half an hour I was still only on Saturday! I’ll keep this as brief as I can and break it up by each day. You can always ask for more details on anything you’re interested in!"
RedDwarf,342mft,emergencyfruit,2,Wed May 6 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"FRIDAY  This was the first time I was ever in the UK, and I wasn’t sure how I would be received, but people were so friendly from the very start, and it helped that I was in costume and an American.  I didn’t know how people would react to Tension Sheet, because it’s a really cheap and really lazy excuse for a cosplay (I literally taped some red bubble wrap over an old Star Trek shirt and wrote “Tension Sheet” in tipp-ex on a card). I also figured that it must be an obvious, even clichéd costume, but holy smeg, people LOVED it, and apparently I was the first one to ever think of it! So even though I had my Bodyswap costume with me, people so adored Tension Sheet that I never wore it. People loved to pop bubbles, and I encouraged them to do so any time they wanted, so if I can think of another fun, interactive costume, I will definitely cosplay again next year!  Friday night kicked off with a pub quiz hosted by Mac McDonald, and I got seated at the smart/slightly anorak-y table, so we won! All we got was a sticker, but nonetheless it was great fun and a chance to show off! Then we went on to karaoke, with someone named Dave Benson Phillips as the DJ (since I didn’t grow up in the UK, I had no clue who he was, but everyone else was freaking out!). I'm not a karaoke person, so instead of staying for long, I met up with /u/Lord_Goatcheese and his mates for a trip out on the town – we went clubbing and had an awesome night! British clubs are the best!"
RedDwarf,342mft,emergencyfruit,3,Wed May 6 19:49:53 2015 UTC,"Im going to reply in segments as I'm reading. Tension sheet in GENIUS! Such a good ice breaker, simple but clever! Mac hosting a quiz... Sad Face Im.. So.. JELLY! Dave Benson Philips is a LEG-END. He is a children's TV presenter and is the dogs nads. British clubbing, well I'm glad you enjoyed it. Not my cuppa tea, but it seems as though it was a perfectly english night so huzzah ... Day 2.."
RedDwarf,342mft,Onesielover88,2,Sun May 10 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"SATURDAY  I woke up with a hangover and headache, and my first thought was still “This is going to be the greatest day of my entire life.” And it was! We had a full English breakfast, I got to meet more people while lots of them were in line for a photoshoot with Mac, Hattie, Shend, and Chris, and then it was Q&A with Mac and Shend, who are great presenters and will do anything for an appreciative audience. ;)  We heard the news that Doug would make an announcement, and when he did, the reaction was incredible. If you see the video, you know he faked us out at first about what the news was, and so we just about exploded when we heard – I think I deafened the guy next to me! :P Then Chris joined Doug for Q&A, and I managed to find the bravery to ask a question, something I’d never done before! :D  Following that, me and a few other lucky souls got to have a coffee session with Chris, Mac, Hattie, Shend, and (by total surprise) Doug! You sit at a table with about 8-10 others, and each of the guests sits and has coffee with the table for about 10 or 15 minutes. Hattie and Mac loved that I was an American; I managed to maintain my dignity (just barely!) in asking Chris about Brittas Empire, and I even got a longstanding question about Red Dwarf answered by Doug. It was absolutely incredible!  Then it was time for autographs! We got called up in groups of 50, which meant there was a lot of downtime. Red Dwarf Olympics was going on (basically just open table games), and they were also showing episodes, but I spent most of my time hanging out with the awesome new friends I was making! People are seriously so welcoming and warm that it brings me to tears thinking about it.   Since Doug was there, he agreed to sign autographs for just a few minutes, and I got my Omnibus book signed! I had brought it on a whim just in case he showed up – after all, you never know!  We moved on to autographs by the cast next, and they were fantastic! Chris and Hattie especially loved to chat with everyone for a few moments, and they were totally great about taking pictures! You got to have your program plus a personal item signed by everyone, so while the lines were enormous, it was so worth it! I just about fainted when I got to Chris (good thing I was wearing bubble wrap!), but he was a great sport and I got some good photos with him! (I had everyone sign some insert booklets in my DVD set, except for Robert on Sunday, who I had sign my copy of The Man in the Rubber Mask)  Following autographs was the auction, which I was not really looking forward to – I thought it was going to be pandering and awkward, but it was actually quite a bit of fun! I didn’t bid on anything, A. because I had just 10 pounds 37p in my pocket, and B. because the stuff they were auctioning off was hilariously useless (a complete set of VHS Red Dwarf tapes, a creepy Kryten head tissue dispenser, part of a plaster mold of Chris’ face, a picture signed by the whole cast…except Craig Charles, etc.). Hattie, Shend, and Chris were the auctioneers, and no one took it too seriously, so it was really, really fun!  I went out to dinner, still dressed as Tension Sheet, and then came back for the costume competition, which was lots of fun and a great chance to see some truly exquisite costumes! We had about 30 contestants, and the winners were a Despair Squid, RoboCop Lister from DNA, and a Rimmer on vacation through the boiler decks, complete with lederhosen and a Skutter! Dave Benson Phillips was at it again, briefly interviewing everyone who participated while we posed for photos. People loved Tension Sheet, and I got a big laugh from the audience (“How long did it take you to make this costume?” “About fifteen seconds.”)  Then we had the disco! DBP was the DJ again, and we had a great lineup of music! I love dancing, and I had a great time with some friends early on, and intermittently throughout the night. And believe it or not, Chris and Hattie joined us on the dance floor! They were rocking out with classic old-people dance moves, and having a great time. Understandably, they only danced for a few songs, and then went to the bar and chatted all night with anyone who wanted to talk. :D Chris got drunk and was going on about everything from craft beers to Top Gear, and yes, I managed to break into one of the conversations and get some more photos! Towards the end of the night, he asked a crew member for a glass of wine, and they brought back a glass filled almost to the top with cheap red. He took two sips, didn’t care for it, and handed it to me, saying “Here, you’re young, you can handle it.” Now I promise I didn’t do anything really creepy, like lick it or drink from the same spot, but I did finish the wine and smuggle the glass back to my room. ;D Chris also led a 30-second singalong that night of a song I didn’t know, but everyone else knew and liked it – it’s probably all over Youtube!  I literally collapsed in a heap at the end of the night – I was exhausted, jet lagged, caffeinated, drunk, hungover, and in a foreign land, but also so excited and fulfilled and euphoric that I was crying. It was like experiencing every positive emotion simultaneously, really overwhelming but so satisfying! Good thing I had friendly people there who didn’t judge or freak out. :) "
RedDwarf,342mft,emergencyfruit,3,Wed May 6 19:51:19 2015 UTC,"Saturday.. Wow.. Speechless! Ive got a proper shit eating grin after reading that! I would never judge for glass smuggling, the things id do for a bit of cat spit ;) :D It sounds like perfection... Next day.."
RedDwarf,342mft,Onesielover88,2,Sun May 10 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"SUNDAY  Sunday was much of the same as Saturday during the day, except that our guests were Danny, Robert, and Gordon Kennedy. Danny and Gordon had showed up the night before for the disco, but I hadn’t gotten much of a chance to talk to them. I skipped the photoshoot and coffee session (out of money, plus I don’t know much about Danny and Robert’s other work) but the second auction and Q&A were a blast! Danny wasn’t feeling well and it showed, but he still put on a good effort during autographs. I had cut up my last roll of red bubble wrap and was handing them out as mini-tension sheets, and I got to give some to Hattie, Gordon, and Robert!   When I got to Robert, my last autographer, he asked about living in the states and how I liked England. I joked that all weekend, everyone had been coming up to me and telling me how much they wanted to go to the US, but since I was enjoying England so much, they should just trade passports with me! I didn’t think it was particularly funny, but Robert loved it, and started laughing. I have to say, being able to make him laugh meant the world to me – it was a chance to give back a tiny bit for all the laughter and fun he and the cast had given me. :D It was the perfect note to end DJ on, and one of my favorite memories.   The convention had thinned out substantially by Sunday afternoon, and I missed Goitless and closing ceremony because of the autograph line, but I don’t mind at all. I wish I could have stayed one more night with the diehard fans, but I don’t feel like I lost out on too much leaving Sunday evening. It was the greatest weekend of my entire life, and I will hands down, no questions asked, forever and always attend every single future DJ I can! BEST CONVENTION IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!"
RedDwarf,342mft,emergencyfruit,2,Wed May 6 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Don't worry dude, it's mostly locals that stay the Sunday night. The die hard fans are the ones that come from across the pond!"

Tried to have a quick scan through to find the scene you were talking about but there's over 40mins of footage and I don't even know which character said the line.

RedDwarf,33jffz,Captain_Boots,9,Thu Apr 23 00:23:01 2015 UTC,"I tried out the version on this blog here.  I had two problems. Firstly, I failed to find my spatula once I started cooking. This meant that my eggs were fully cooked (not runny) and messed up almost to the point of being scrambled. This also caused me to forget to add a dash of salt and pepper.  Secondly, I applied a bit too much chutney. I went for mild chutney, but even had it been spicy I think I needed more Sriracha and less chutney. It was still not bad really!"
RedDwarf,33jffz,tecun_uman,14,Thu Apr 23 00:25:00 2015 UTC,The trick is to eat it before the bread dissolves!
RedDwarf,33jffz,Theophagist,3,Thu Apr 23 00:44:53 2015 UTC,I toasted it .. and didn't use enough chili sauce! There will be a second attempt. (with spatula)
RedDwarf,33jffz,TalkieToasterBot,11,Thu Apr 23 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"I think what's most endearing about your post is that you took a very Lister approach to the cooking process.   If Listy made this for himself he would probably have lost his spatula leading to egg failure then sloshed the eggs onto cheap fluffy budget white bread with way too much sauce, generally creating a semi-edible mess.     I was a chef in a former life (still do a lot of cooking) and I took a keen interest in this sandwich.  When I put it together I set out to make a great sandwich I would want to eat again.  Being a nerd, I wanted it to still be canon.   First, I assume I'm enjoying one prepared by Kryten, who was known for making Lister's favorite food.  And of course 4 eggs is just too much food, so I would make a half-sandwich.    I fried the eggs medium and made a home-made fruit chutney with shallots, raisins and minced peach.  I used sriracha sparingly for the right amount of kick to complement and offset the sweet chutney.  Peppered and salted the eggs.  Finally, I used a dense but soft Italian bread with the crusts cut off.  Sliced Texas Toast size, buttered and toasted in a pan separately so as not to heat the cool chutney and overcook the eggs.   I had these quite a few times until the chutney ran out and I moved on to other cooking projects to graze on."
RedDwarf,33jffz,TalkieToasterBot,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:11:48 2015 UTC,"I did try to take a Lister approach! In fact, I actually felt guilty about toasting the bread, which was a cheap variety of wheat bread instead of cheap white bread. I alleviated the guilt by imagining Talkie Toaster badgering me for it.  The 'fancy' version sounds tasty too!"

RedDwarf,33jffz,Penetrecia,2,Fri Apr 24 17:44:25 2015 UTC,Mix the Sriracha into the chutney before applying next time. It makes it a lot less messy. It also makes a great dipping sauce. Sriracha and any jam is also a great substitute for a sweet chili sauce.

RedDwarf,33jffz,robo-mitten,3,Thu Apr 23 04:52:10 2015 UTC,Nope. I suspect the Sriracha sauce was affected by the radiation and being 3 million years old. Holograms definitely get fresher ingredients.

I don't toast the bread (use white bread), use Branston as the chutney, garlic Sriracha (not the normal kind, this one is like kebab shop chili sauce) and cook the eggs easy so they run (to get the dissolvey bread).    It's a state of the art sarnie!"

Go on this premise and it explains every single continuinty issue between seasons on Red Dwarf   This is why they are always the same, but with differences.  Ie cat is a hell of a lot smarter in Season 6 than he was in previous seasons.   Its why Lister had his appendix out.. twice.  Why Rimmer is dead then alive again, then dead again."
RedDwarf,31uwdk,nastybacon,6,Wed Apr 8 12:42:55 2015 UTC,And the interior of Red Dwarf keeps drastically changing.

RedDwarf,31uwdk,HowdyDoodlyDoo,3,Wed Apr 8 14:56:39 2015 UTC,I kind of wish they'd just keep Rimmer's uniform consistent at least. I really liked his green one on S3.
RedDwarf,31uwdk,wiredfire,18,Wed Apr 8 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"My personal theory is that season 8 Rimmer died. Some point later, Ace chickened out and returned as Rimmer.   This is why season 9/10 Rimmer refers to older stuff."
RedDwarf,31uwdk,Lilchef,3,Wed Apr 8 13:05:05 2015 UTC,Works for me!
RedDwarf,31uwdk,greenthumble,11,Wed Apr 8 13:07:51 2015 UTC,"Red Dwarf has never worried about consistency, they just do whatever works for the show. I think for 9 they just wanted to return to the status quo of Rimmer being a hologram. As for the ending of 8 - they even joke about that being unresolved in 10."
RedDwarf,31uwdk,Rampage470,7,Wed Apr 8 12:06:57 2015 UTC,"Kryten, unpack Rachel and get out the puncture repair kit. Don't you think it's incredible! I AM ALIVE! [smashes fists down on barrels of explosives].  Rimmer can't stay alive to save his life. :P"
RedDwarf,31uwdk,nauticalfiesta,6,Wed Apr 8 19:38:52 2015 UTC,I seem to remember Naylor saying at a convention that the Rimmer in Back to Earth and X is the original Rimmer.
RedDwarf,31uwdk,GoroTheBastard,3,Wed Apr 8 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"He died at the end of Series 9, like everyone else on the ship that hadn't left. Kryten, Lister, Kochanski and the Cat all went into a mirror universe, where the ship was empty for some reason, and they ended up in one where Holly was gone, and Rimmer was dead.  The lack of in-universe explanations is pretty normal for the series though. I mean, organics, glass, and other well, everything, will eventually breakdown after a while. They should be naked and starving that far into the future."
RedDwarf,31uwdk,JonnyRobbie,4,Wed Apr 8 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"I want to say it's implied that he did die at the end of Only the Good.. But honestly those following seasons were just poorly tacked on rubbish, it felt like not much thought went into it other than an excuse for a reunion."
RedDwarf,31uwdk,GoroTheBastard,14,Wed Apr 8 10:36:29 2015 UTC,That's true about Back to Earth. But The newest season 10 was pretty good.

RedDwarf,31uwdk,Monsieur-Anana,5,Wed Apr 8 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"In series 9, the best series of them all, Resurrected Rimmer gets lost in the mirror universe forever, but his sacrifice allows Lister, Kryten, Kochanski, and the Cat to survive.  He is resurrected as a Hologram and realizes that life would have been more fun if he had taken chances, and wants to do more with his life.  In comes original HoloRimmer, as Ace, who is tired of being Ace, and take the opportunity to swap with the other Rimmer.  It is around this time that Kris realizes that Lister didn't learn anything from Rimmer's sacrifice, and it still happy to just bum around space.  She convinces Kryten to fake her death so she can leave the ship and look for the other refugees, possibly to bring them back to Red Dwarf.  Then you have the events of ""Back to Earth"", after which, they move to different quarters because they realize they are no longer suited to elisted quarters, but the Officer's quarters, like they had in series 4 and 5 are inaccessible, so to save time, effort, and energy, they move into quarters adjacent to the supply decks, and setup links to the drive room there, so when they need supplies it isn't such a journey."

Netflix don't geo restrict their in house content because they own it & grasp that getting to the maximum audience is a winner!

Takes a couple years to get it out of the system.  I suspect that with Series 9.

Especially after the accident - if any other crewmember played guitar, he could use theirs. My thinking is that if the Les Paul means that much to him, he would probably keep it somewhere safe and play a different one most of the time, until it inevitably got destroyed in some misadventure and he ran out of others, leaving him with his one and only favorite. I mean, you have to imagine Kryten and Rimmer at least once teaming up to jettison a guitar out an airlock, only to find Lister had another one waiting to go. :D"

After the cat destroyed it, it seems unlikely that he would have the know how to repair it.   Why did lister play the cheaper guitar when he had a les Paul since be was 16?

He also was fired by Red Dwarf when he was doing their warm ups for the studio audience. (Craig has gone on record as saying that in all fairness to Eddie, warm ups need a faster pace and you dont have time to build a concept like you need with his act)  and given that he'll finally have some free time and was friends with Capaldi (and a huge fan of the show) I wouldn't be surprised to hear that our good friend confidence (Craig Ferguson) might be in Dr. Who soon."

RedDwarf,2vm9jv,SuramKale,2,Thu Feb 12 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's absolutely brilliant in that way. So many sci fi tropes! I think that might be one of the keys to both its uniqueness and success as a long running show."
RedDwarf,2vm9jv,autowikibot,6,Fri Feb 13 04:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yes Lister is from Liverpool, he isn't a geordie. My favourite thing about the show is the fact that there are no aliens. Every being they come across is from earth or made by humans."

RedDwarf,2vm9jv,jbmass,2,Thu Feb 12 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"Fermi paradox:       The Fermi paradox (or Fermi's paradox) is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilization and humanity's lack of contact with, or evidence for, such civilizations.  The basic points of the argument, made by physicists Enrico Fermi and Michael H. Hart, are:   The Sun is a typical star, and relatively young. There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are billions of years older. With high probability, some of these stars will have Earth-like planets.  Assuming the Earth is typical, some of these planets may develop intelligent life. Some of these civilizations may develop interstellar travel, a technology Earth is investigating even now (such as the 100 Year Starship). Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the galaxy can be completely colonized in a few tens of millions of years.   According to this line of thinking, the Earth should already have been colonized, or at least visited. But Fermi saw no convincing evidence of this, nor of signs of intelligence (see Empirical resolution attempts) elsewhere in our galaxy or (to the extent it would be detectable) elsewhere in the observable universe. Hence Fermi's question, ""Where is everybody?""

RedDwarf,2vm9jv,eldest_gruff,6,Thu Feb 12 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not alone in this but I love the bunk scenes. The dynamic between two people that are polar opposites being forced to live together. I like Cat and Kryten, but Red Dwarf to me is Rimmer and Lister in their bunk."
RedDwarf,2vm9jv,mischaleigh,5,Thu Feb 12 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"I just finished watching them all for the first time too! I like both the characters of Lister and Rimmer, both individually and combined. The dynamic between them is hilarious, but they're also interesting and at times insightful people just on their own, which provides a great balance. I really enjoy that it also centers a lot on the characters' sense of selves - even the aliens they encounter are almost always created by, or are other versions of, the boys from the Dwarf. I love introspective scifi like that, so to have it in a British comedy with such a stellar crew (pardon the pun) is fan-smeggin'-tastic!   And I've always got a special place in my heart for shows where it is obvious that behind the scenes, the actors truly get along and are having fun with it. I live in the midwestern USA, and it's really disappointing that I will probably never be able to attend Dimension Jump, and that so few people out here have ever heard of this show! On that note, I'm planning to start going through the series a second time in the next few days - drop me a line if you'd like to chat!"

RedDwarf,2vm9jv,emergencyfruit,2,Fri Feb 13 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"Twin Cities suburb here too! I thought I'd give it a second try recently since I heard it would be removed from Netflix. I couldn't get into the show about 15 years ago when I first tried to watch it, but loved it instantly now. I wish I was able to appreciate it when I watched it back then, but maybe the timing was right on this second try.  :D"
RedDwarf,2vm9jv,AllWoWNoSham,2,Fri Feb 13 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"Smegging hell, that's awesome! :D And for all the inconvenience Netflix has caused, how great that at least it forced us to give Red Dwarf a (second) try. Without the time pressure, it would probably have just drifted in my Netflix queue for the next year or so, and I would have missed out on what is currently in my top ten favorite shows of all time."
