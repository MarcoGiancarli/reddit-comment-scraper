GameDealsMeta,3e04kg,Shardwing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"Damn, sorry, I didn't even see that. My eyes are ruined."
GameDealsMeta,3e04kg,Monsis101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:02 2015 UTC,Thank you. Seems like I failed my first test in posting@reddit-101.

GameDealsMeta,3dyn1t,10000_Spoons_Irony,3,Mon Jul 20 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"They responded to someone having the same issue on Twitter here, doesn't seem like they've acknowledged it as a wide-affecting issue yet. Could be that they're not out of keys and that what you're seeing is an error."
GameDealsMeta,3dyn1t,Shardwing,4,Mon Jul 20 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"This has really turned me off to HB. I won't be buying from them again. They took my money, then told me they didn't have the product I just payed for, and the only information they give you if this happens is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, cause the support ninjas would take an estimated 5 DAYS to respond to a ticket!  The worst part is Gamesplanet had a sale on the same game, for CHEAPER, and they even tell you whether or not it's in stock, before you buy it!  The $10 I saved buying from HB was not worth being dicked around for several days."
GameDealsMeta,3dmo4b,InukChinook,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"If you check out the official Nintendo store online they've got refurbed Wii U's for cheap.  They tend to sell out and be gone for a while though.  They have a one year warranty straight from Nintendo and I haven't heard anything bad about them.  You're missing packaging I think, and it doesn't come with the gamepad stand, but whatever.    At the end of the day I think I paid..$260-280~ for mine after tax and shipping.  I got the bundle with Super Mario and Nintendoland.  You don't get physical copies of the games unless otherwise stated, though you used to.  YMMV in that respect."
GameDealsMeta,3dmo4b,noonespecific,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"In Ontario at least, there's a no-tax day at Real Canadian Superstore tomorrow (Saturday). Check their flyer to see if it's the same elsewhere. http://www.realcanadiansuperstore.ca  I don't have any specific deals otherwise. Try your local Kijiji/Craigslist, if you don't mind buying used. Maybe see if anyone has old stock of the 8GB white model for cheaper. Supposedly, using Shoppers Drug Mart's Optimum rewards on their special 20x earning, and then redemption days is a good way to buy consoles. I don't know a whole lot about that, though."
GameDealsMeta,3diede,himmatsj,5,Thu Jul 16 14:57:27 2015 UTC,can you please provide the source?  EDIT: here is a link (for me the Promo starts from 3rd item) http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=Nvidia+GTX+960&N=-1&isNodeId=1
GameDealsMeta,3diede,mitooil,4,Thu Jul 16 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, putting it into the OP."
GameDealsMeta,3diede,Tomasety,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:45 2015 UTC,Newegg US. You can check browsing the GPUs section. It shows even for Nvidia GTX 960.
GameDealsMeta,3diede,mitooil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:28:17 2015 UTC,Nvidia GTX 960   thanks. here is the link for reference (for it starts at 3rd item):  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=Nvidia+GTX+960&N=-1&isNodeId=1
GameDealsMeta,3diede,wjousts,5,Thu Jul 16 15:33:56 2015 UTC,Let's hope it does better to demonstrate their cards than Arkham Knight did.
GameDealsMeta,3diede,JohnAnderton,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"I wonder if those who got Arkahm Knight can ask for this one, as AK is still broken."
GameDealsMeta,3diede,shinjae,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"When these promos usually become active? I'm buying a new card next week, but I'm not a big fan of Batman."
GameDealsMeta,3diede,Mogazee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"Was just about to build a new PC, and was considering the 980GTX.  This probably seals the deal!"
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,ImBeingMe,19,Tue Jul 14 02:42:29 2015 UTC,thank you blink bundle team. I wish you all the best for the future!
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,mitooil,7,Tue Jul 14 07:28:45 2015 UTC,Everything on mine was labeled redeemed. Good job me.
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,smeggysmeg,6,Tue Jul 14 04:04:10 2015 UTC,That only means the key was revealed on the account page. There was no 'redeemed' checkbox or anything.
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,Trislar,4,Tue Jul 14 09:00:04 2015 UTC,"Updated the parent post with that info. Thanks, I thought they had a used box like Flying Bundle"
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,WonderWeasel42,3,Tue Jul 14 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"I had an entire bundle unredeemed - yeesh.  Rectified that right quickly.  Awesome on Blink for doing this, I never would have known."
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,nightrunner227,2,Tue Jul 14 19:21:55 2015 UTC,The only bundle I bought there was entirely unredeemed...
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,jjkk0000,7,Tue Jul 14 21:17:28 2015 UTC,thanks for blink bundle team .
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,CyberInferno,5,Tue Jul 14 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"Nice of them to do. I think Casey leaving was the death of Blink Bundle, sadly. I don't know that for a fact, but I think we only got one bundle after he left."
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,gotta_ban_them_all,3,Tue Jul 14 14:31:17 2015 UTC,who is Casey?
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,CyberInferno,6,Tue Jul 14 19:15:04 2015 UTC,"/u/CaseyBlink was the guy who used to always post the bundles on /r/GameDeals, and he seemed to be a driving force behind them.  To make an analogy, Casey was to Blink Bundle as Tony was to Amazon on /r/GameDeals."
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,gotta_ban_them_all,3,Tue Jul 14 19:28:59 2015 UTC,as Tony was to Amazon on /r/GameDeals[3] .   Damn. Wonder how he's doing in the mobile department now. I've switched to the iOS ecosystem so haven't been following up.
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,Trislar,2,Tue Jul 14 19:35:18 2015 UTC,He's not working at Amazon anymore.
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,Trucidar,10,Tue Jul 14 23:21:28 2015 UTC,That's pretty awesome.
GameDealsMeta,3d7fgz,kilamreddit,2,Tue Jul 14 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, even if I have redeemed all the keys, it's something I appreciate, lot of good games."
GameDealsMeta,3cx4x7,jon2kx,4,Sat Jul 11 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"I am interested, sure. It just seems that it'd be hard to do for little payoff when you can just search for your platform across GameDeals, and (number out of my ass) 80% of the deals here are PC."
GameDealsMeta,3cx4x7,ShinDigpay,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a PC-centric guy, but my brother loves PS4, even though I gave him a lenovo y50 with an GTX 860M 4GB. Idk the man likes physical copies."
GameDealsMeta,3cx4x7,ShinDigpay,3,Sat Jul 11 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"I get it, it's like comic books. Sure you can get a PDF, but holding the paper just feels better. But you can just search game deals for ""PS4"", switch to ""new"" and any PS4 games on sale we've found will pop up. (Including physical and digital download)"
GameDealsMeta,3cx4x7,smudi,2,Sat Jul 11 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"I'll try that. I was thinking we could do a simple regex filter or something, or a tag system. Kind of the way pcmr does it."
GameDealsMeta,3cszeo,McKack,6,Fri Jul 10 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, though keys were added on june 6th."
GameDealsMeta,3cszeo,Tomasety,3,Fri Jul 10 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, noticed it hadn't been posted yet so thought I'd give people here a heads up."
GameDealsMeta,3cszeo,webtax,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:06:11 2015 UTC,"was this added recently?, seems like i had the game from some time, not sure if from this bundle http://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/info?plain=butsbal"
GameDealsMeta,3cszeo,Trislar,2,Fri Jul 10 17:11:35 2015 UTC,They got the keys up four days ago. Got to say I'm surprised someone is still operating Indie Royale. Thought they were dead in the water.
