lgbtaww,3bkp1u,24Aids37,3,Tue Jun 30 11:04:19 2015 UTC,"We were at the Supreme Court at 10am, to hear the decision and celebrate. Its fun because you get to see the news interns run out of the court to thier respective news agencies and deliver the decision.  We went to the court again at 6pm for a rally, but there was just a guy and his wife with a sign telling us to repent. There was a lot of playful, and unproductive yelling between that guy and a crowd of Marriage equality supporters. We decided to leave for happy hour.  This photo was taken around midnight. It was just amazing seeing the White House lit up in a rainbow. Obama has some top notch PR people this week."

lgbtaww,2jb8ov,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Oct 15 12:33:29 2014 UTC,"Tomb of the Diver:       The Tomb of the Diver is an archaeological monument, found by the Italian archaeologist Mario Napoli on 3 June 1968 during his excavation of a small necropolis about 1.5 km south of the Greek city of Paestum in Magna Graecia, in what is now southern Italy. The tomb is now displayed in the museum at Paestum.  It is a grave made of five local limestone slabs forming the four lateral walls and the roof, the floor being excavated in the natural rock ground. The five slabs, accurately bonded with plaster, formed a chamber sized — roughly – 215 × 100 × 80 cm (7.1 × 3.3 × 2.6 ft). All five slabs forming the monument were painted on the interior sides using a true fresco technique. The paintings on the four walls depict a symposium scene, while the cover slab shows the famous scene that gives the tomb its name: a young man diving into a curling and waving stream of water. Two masters have been distinguished, the south wall being by a less impressive artist than the others.   When the tomb was discovered, these surprising frescos revealed its importance as they appear to be the ""only example of Greek painting with figured scenes dating from the Orientalizing, Archaic, or Classical periods to survive in its entirety. Among the thousands of Greek tombs known from this time (roughly 700–400 BC), this is the only one to have been decorated with frescoes of human subjects.""

It sucks that he's had such a rough situation."

As an openly gay and Christian guy, and also one that speaks sign language and is still involved in church leadership- sorry for the hurt that has been caused to both of you.

Thanks to your friend for making the video- it's super sexy, and hope things are looking up for you both. ;)"

lgbtaww,2eyp22,LimivorousArbour,25,Fri Aug 29 23:32:10 2014 UTC,"We met in grad school.  I saw him in line for Star Trek: Nemesis and was shyly awestruck.  Saw his pic on gay.com and sent him email. Met for noodles, went for a hike.  That evening got together again to watch Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  Never finished it. He's from Texas.  Grew up playing football and cello.  Spent his summers riding horses and running wild in the mountains of Colorado with a pack of dogs and a pet chicken. I grew up in Canada, a computer nerd, bookworm, sometimes cycling and cross-country skiing. He taught me how to make enchiladas and salpicon.  I taught him toques and poutine. We've followed each other around the world for work and school, and always sacrificed to be together. In my family, six people reading books in comfortable silence is a great evening.  In his family, a well-crafted insult is like a hug.  We spend christmas with my family, thanksgiving with his. He cracks me up.  He cracks himself up.  I am sometimes woken up by his mad giggling about something hilarious he said in a dream. We married in my parent's backyard.  My family catered.  His family flew two thousand miles to be there. He cried through our wedding vows.  I vowed to continue bringing him coffee in bed every morning. When I'm away on business, he tells me he is saving up so many ear wiggles for me.  Wiggles my ears promptly when I get home. Apparently I cried in Toy Story 3.  Allegedly not drunk.  I record this under protest. We're both psychopathic perfectionists.  Our home is the sole zone of forgiveness in our lives.  We grow more weeds than tomatoes. He twitches when I put the dishes in the ""wrong"" place.  Apparently I am prone to ""dish storage innovations."" Most of our vacations are kayak and canoe camping.  We put ludicrous amounts of effort into backcountry cooking.  Scones.  Arepas. Blueberry upside-down cake.  Deep dish pizzas. Advice to young gaybros: find someone who loves you as much as you love them.  Be selfless, look out for each other, and hold on with both hands."

There was no thought behind taking her to the parade except that we knew she'd have fun. Though my sister says she is very lucky to have me as an aunt and rolemodel, so she has both straight and gay rolemodels to see that either way is okay. What's your problem?"

Like, it's fairly commonplace today to see a same-sex couple, but it was so much harder to be out back in the day.   Which is the long way if saying: good on your grandmothers!

lgbtaww,1jzypq,PositivelyClueless,7,Fri Aug 9 17:28:18 2013 UTC,"Here is a few questions and answers from their interview:  Q: In your opinions, what is the biggest change you've seen in the LGBT community?  A:  Cat: I think the evolution of drag is a huge deal for me. I was performing as Mr. Mitch in drag shows years ago around the time Michelle McCausland was fighting for the right to dress in drag. When I was doing drag, you could be arrested for lewd and lascivious conduct. Since then, it's become almost commonplace.  Diana: In addition to drag's evolution, I'd say taht visibility is a huge triumph. The decisions by the Supreme Court concerning DOMA and Prop 8 are huge. Being honest and promoting education about sexuality is important in staying visible.   Q: What is the biggest hurdle you've overcome in your relationship?  A:  Diana: It was a big deal to me when my ex-husband took me to court trying to get custody of my kids. He was an alcoholic and was an unfit father. In the end, I barely won the case because, back then, the court felt that being a lesbian just barely outweighed being an alcoholic in terms of raising kids. I just spoke a little better than he did at court. It was a close call."

We get there, and it's FREEZING. During the day, the sun made it bearable. But at night, it was so freezing cold that i ended up having to buy a sweatshirt - the last sweatshirt Walmart had. Hence, why i am wearing an XXL purple Western Carolina hoodie in all the night scenes."

lgbtaww,1jbx3t,ohsweetjesusmytits,1 point,Wed Jul 31 04:22:17 2013 UTC,"Because the singer is the ""somebody new."" When I heard Robyn sing this song, I thought it was about a girl giving advice to a guy friend about his own situation that had nothing to do with her.  When I heard this guy sing it, I understood the lyrics very differently. Now it's about two guys having an affair and one of them is trying to tell the other that he needs to tell his girlfriend the truth (ie come out)."
lgbtaww,1jbx3t,pennwastemanagement,3,Sat Aug 3 07:12:53 2013 UTC,"Just saying, Robyn is the ""other woman"" in her song. ""It's so different when WE kiss""."

lgbtaww,1fx01r,queeraslefuck,-1,Sat Jun 8 18:23:23 2013 UTC,You can ask my partner how I do with consent.
lgbtaww,1fx01r,queeraslefuck,1 point,Sat Jun 8 22:28:31 2013 UTC,"Your previous partners have said enough, and you've spoken loads more too."
lgbtaww,1fx01r,queeraslefuck,-2,Sat Jun 8 23:52:59 2013 UTC,"My previous partner also appropriates my identities and experience. My previous partners are also white and rich. Masculine POC often live life in my shoes. It doesn't surprise me much that class and race haven't been part of the discussion. That being said, it's not your life nor your business. If you were truly concerned, you'd ask my partner if they are safe. Have you done that or do you only passive aggressively complain on the internet while never taking productive action?"
lgbtaww,1fx01r,main_hoon_na,-1,Sat Jun 8 23:59:51 2013 UTC,not one persyn who runs their mouth about Ira has asked me if I'm safe at all. I have however been told that tumblr is waiting to hear my abuse stories and I have been told that if I am raped it is my fault for associating with a rapist. I am being blamed for a rape that hasn't and won't happen by people who Identify themselves as anti rape culture. posers is an understatement.
lgbtaww,1fx01r,ediblestars,0,Sun Jun 9 00:29:57 2013 UTC,"You've said in that post that you haven't been abused, and I took you at your word. I didn't say I expect you to be abused, that is shit, and you're right to call them out on their shit. You're dipshit about everything else though."
lgbtaww,1fx01r,mitusus,-1,Sun Jun 9 07:43:46 2013 UTC,"Let's be real here, you're trying to minimize rape because of class, rape, and the sins of your rapee. Then you try to use your elite privilege as an activist to shut down your criticism. Your partner has said enough that they feel safe and happy, I'm truly not worried for them. And now you're saying calling out rape is not taking action, nor is it productive. Should I instead go about denying it online? Are those your footsteps to productive action?  You're also trying to minimize the importance of online spaces in the lives of marginalized people, as well as trying to shut up the only voice that the voiceless may have. Furthermore, you're assuming that occupying an online space means doing nothing in offline space.  You have a role in the theater of my community, and that ends up being my business."
lgbtaww,1fx01r,queeraslefuck,-1,Sun Jun 9 07:48:42 2013 UTC,"Not minimizing, only highlighting connections often ignored and perpetuated by white, rich folks. I don't play oppression olympics. You can do that on your own time. Activism doesn't come with privilege. Being an activist doesn't give me more institutional access than other brown, trans*, neurodivergent, poor, immigrant, queer folks. My partner is fine with me since we do this thing called communicating. They're also fine with me despite accusations since they believe in restorative justice, and neither of us believe in isolating folks for their behavior. We have no desire to perpetuate the values of the prison industrial complex, another way to control brown and black masculine folks. So yes, you're being useless in the world of rape prevention since you're talking to people you don't know, about people you don't know, about a situation you don't know. I've done work within my community, accountability related (which I initiated) and activist related. When you're part of my community, I'll act like I owe you something. Until then, feel free to do something useful."

lgbtaww,1c8222,Steffi_van_Essen,3,Fri Apr 12 20:45:22 2013 UTC,The upvote/downvote figures are randomly generated somewhere around the actual figure. Apparently that helps prevent fixing. You even get apparent downvotes in subs like this where only upvotes are possible.
lgbtaww,1c8222,SulliverVittles,2,Fri Apr 12 22:06:20 2013 UTC,"Mostly true. With RES, people can still downvote when there is no arrow to click."

lgbtaww,1c8222,SulliverVittles,2,Fri Apr 12 22:51:58 2013 UTC,"You can use the keyboard to upvote/downvote. A is set to upvote and Z is downvote. For example, I can click on OP's post and hit Z and it downvotes. I wouldn't do that of course though, as he is just too damn adorable."

lgbtaww,1a1pwy,hexxial,11,Sun Mar 10 22:59:08 2013 UTC,D'aaawwwwwwww! Back story?
lgbtaww,1a1pwy,Jabberwockey,13,Sun Mar 10 23:44:27 2013 UTC,"We met online six years ago. We've always been good friends and been there for each other. The first time I felt something was when I saw a video where he shows up (I'm the one on the right, dressed in white), but that was it.  Last year we decided to try and use skype to chat with each other through the webcams. Something clicked then, like some kind of love at first sight.  The very next day I couldn't stop thinking when was he going to show up online again. Turns out that feeling was reciprocous.  We fell in love soon after. Since then we are always talking to each other and be there for each other. Can't really tell when did we start dating, it was so natural, like we were made for each other since the very beginning, that it happenned without us noticing it.   Six months later he came to Portugal to spend a month with me. And every day was better than the one before.  I'm writing this while I see him... through skype. I'm fighting agaisn't this. I'm fighting to leave this country and go live with him. I love him with all my energy, heart and soul. It's what keeps me going.  :-)"
lgbtaww,1a1pwy,Jabberwockey,6,Mon Mar 11 20:18:49 2013 UTC,Awww :`-)  A friend of mine had that with a girl from Taiwan. He now lives there the life of his dreams.  I wish you two the best in the world.  I wish I'd meet someone like that.

lgbtaww,19yhwn,eatsa_pizza,3,Sun Mar 10 00:54:39 2013 UTC,you guys have only been together three months?
lgbtaww,19yhwn,cyllm,3,Sat Mar 9 11:56:27 2013 UTC,"Yes, we have.   I have known her much longer than that, though. We met at a wedding and even though I had only spent about one full day with her at that point, I knew that there was something about her and I definitely felt a strong connection with her. After I had gone home, we spent just about every night talking and laughing on the phone for hours. A couple months later, I flew back out there and spent over a week with her. After that, I knew that there was definitely something there and she was different from anyone else that I've met. We started dating soon after that visit :)  Since then, she has flown here and spent a week with me and met my family, and I have visited her two other times and met her family. Collectively, we've spent about a month ""living"" together. We get along tremendously and understand each other on a level I never knew was possible. She is my other half."
lgbtaww,19yhwn,posttits,3,Sun Mar 10 05:22:41 2013 UTC,"That's good to hear! I'm glad you guys have taken the time to spend more then just a few days or hours together once in a while and actually lived with each other, alot of people find that they get along together just great for a few hours each day, but the minute they move in with each other they find that they don't get along all that well when in close quarters for long. Just means that such a happy and cute looking couple won't be arguing constantly .^ cheers then!"
