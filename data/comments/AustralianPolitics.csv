AustralianPolitics,3e1t5r,im_philbo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:22:37 2015 UTC,what's their stance on Nuclear?
AustralianPolitics,3e1t5r,Sinkust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:00:52 2015 UTC,"We haven't yet put out an energy policy - so still in draft. But the overall idea is sustainability - and while nuclear might push that envelope out a long way/lower emissions - it'd be a transition to full renewables (but hampered by extremely long lead time and huge public protest to get up).  Personally I'd have to say that while nuclear might be better in an emission sense than coal - it's probably now missed the game in terms of price point and environmental issues (e.g. our nuclear mining industry isn't great on environmental track record). If we'd built nuclear decades back rather than brown coal power stations - our emissions footprint would be a lot healthier than today for sure. But that was decades back - and costs of nuclear aren't exactly falling, nor is the public any less fearful of nuclear (irrational though it might be when compared to the deaths and health impact of coal! Not to mention the radioactivity of coal that never seems to get mentioned).  Given the turnaround to shovel hitting the ground can be far lower with distributed renewables - wouldn't that make more sense given all the science saying we should be drastically cutting emissions ASAP. It's going to take decades getting a nuclear power plant and the required refinery/storage past planning.   So if we were going to invest in next gen technology - solar thermal with storage would seem to be a more likely direction for ""baseload"" as the cost overruns and the like with the next generation reactors isn't awe inspiring to say the least.   So as a preference - far more palatable to have a renewables energy platform than nuclear - but if there was evidence suggesting it was a better bet and deliverable quick enough - it might form part of the platform..    FYI - prior to things like solar thermal with storage I was an advocate of nuclear over coal - if there were just two choices coal or nuclear I reckon we'd be better off going nuclear. But with renewables proving they can work and providing distributed power to boot: I think they're the winner.  Your thoughts?"
AustralianPolitics,3e0fxz,Qldaah,5,Tue Jul 21 00:22:34 2015 UTC,"You'd think someone at that level would understand the fungibility of money. Every cent the states bring in is a cent the federal government can not give them, which is a cent Joe can give out as corporate welfare. There is no magical way to ""quarantine"" that cent, since it's not technically the same cent, just entirely equivalent.  The GST already takes from the low and middle income earners disproportionately to their income, effectively a 10% flat tax (which higher income earners paying less than 10% since they spend more of their income on non-GST goods such as overseas expenditure).  Increasing the GST is regressive taxation."
AustralianPolitics,3e0fxz,WazWaz,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:15 2015 UTC,"What percentage of Australians have an adequate grasp of economics to make an informed decision on tax reform? I'd suggest very low.

The impact on very low income earners can be mitigated by adjusting other allowances."
AustralianPolitics,3dxitd,Qldaah,2,Mon Jul 20 10:25:43 2015 UTC,Both Bishop and Barnaby Joyce seem to mix up their public responsibilities with their party obligations to attend fund raisers. Does it need to be said that their party is a private entity which has nothing to do with the taxpayer. It isn't a charity nor entitled to any of the considerations as such. If they want to attend a wedding (how recent was that) or any other private event then get out your credit card.
AustralianPolitics,3dxitd,crosstherubicon,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think Joyce's comments at the end speak to the problem. The pollies collectively think of government functions OR party functions as work, not to their benefit. That justifies in their mind, someone else footing the bill. The problem is that they don't see that their party may be in government, however it is not government business to deal with party matters. There are many government agencies and workers that deal with travel on a regular basis. Why can the government not deal with travel and expenses in the same way? A central booking process for all parties and members that gets invoiced directly after making arrangements."

AustralianPolitics,3dwjl3,kroxigor01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:51 2015 UTC,"The main argument for it is that it's incredibly simple to implement and monitor. Compared to income tax and the enormous complexity of our taxation system its blissfully straight forward.   Another upside is its really easy to forecast for budget allocation because it tends to follow consumer confidence and economic spending.   That being said, its still a very regressive tax that takes equally from all segments of society. For this reason it is extremely effective at gathering funds, and many people who advocate for GST style taxes argue that it discourages the people who can least afford it from spending on goods and services they don't necessarily need."
AustralianPolitics,3dwjl3,Ucinorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"I remember 1998 vividly (the GST came in 2 years later) because I was campaigning my arse off to try and stop it. For those wondering if this is a good idea or not:  It is great if you are rich and fucked if you are not. The GST is a regressive tax as opposed to a progressive tax in that there is a shift of the tax burden. Before the GST, the more money you earned, the more tax you paid. The GST hasn't gotten rid of this concept entirely, but it is a move towards a flat tax rate and continues the attempt by the rich to reverse the idea that progressive taxation is a good thing.  They had to wait this long (10 years) before trying to start the national 'discussion' again to allow as many people to forget John Howard's promise that they would never, ever raise the GST. This is the same guy that said he would 'never, ever' introduce a GST but I digress.  Raising the GST is purely and simply another attempt to transfer more and more of the wealth of this country into the hands of the rich. Like they don't have enough money as it is!"

Labor has again emphatically ruled out reintroducing a carbon tax but confirmed it is still examining a new climate change policy that will include an emissions trading scheme.   ...   Here the Libs want to be able to call an ETS a ""tax"" ....   Treasurer Joe Hockey described the proposal as ""madness"".   ""I mean the situation here is Bill Shorten now wants not one carbon tax but two carbon taxes and you have to ask yourself, why would he want to do this?   ... because we know that they are relying on a sizable number of supporters who can only parse half sentences and who think that being opposed to any kind of ""TAX"" makes them better off.  Repeat after me Dorothy: ""No Big Tax""."
AustralianPolitics,3dcfvm,johnbentley,3,Wed Jul 15 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"I considered writing that but I dislike the term carbon tax as it isn't entirely accurate and was used by the LNP to capture the debate. Besides, I feel the mechanism is different enough that using the term carbon pricing to differentiate a CT from an ETS isn't particularly problematic, ie: it's not the price on carbon that creates an incentive to reduce emissions under an ETS so much as it is the cap on emissions and the value of the permits, which do not have a fixed price and are open for trade (unlike the carbon tax, aka: fixed price ETS in its form under the Gillard Government). The point is debatable, I know, but figured I'd clear up where I'm coming from."
AustralianPolitics,3dcfvm,gnarwar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yes the cap in the ETS, a cap that gets reduced over time, is indeed the important thing about that scheme.  But the ""value of the permits"" derives from their price.  I've take your point that you've just accounted for why you chose the terms you did. But I'll point to the standard labels for these things ....  If you look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price , for example, under https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price#Carbon_policies you'll see ""Carbon Tax"" and ""Cap and Trade"".   ""Cap and Trade"" being what we call in OZ an ""Emissions Trading Scheme"".  So it's no as if, for example, the LNP invented the label ""Carbon Tax"" for the scheme Labor settled on. Rather the LNP flogged the ""TAX"" part of that pre-existing label as a bad thing: playing to popular prejudices against any kind of tax.  Anyway it sounds like we both agree: an ETS is a good thing."
AustralianPolitics,3dcfvm,johnbentley,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no real issues here. Although I would point out that the value of permits does not solely refer to their price, but also their function, which is to allow polluters to avoid reducing emissions if they wish."

There are research benefits there too by working ""with industry'.

I'd really like to know what their definition of ""at sea"" is, because there is no way a 94m ship can store fuel and rations for 40 people for 300 days. its not nuclear.

AustralianPolitics,3d8ess,pm-me-with-your-tits,4,Tue Jul 14 08:53:37 2015 UTC,"I personally think this is a pretty difficult issue to get our minds around, with regards to the long history of migration and asylum seeking to Australia. Some may say that we have to start with Vietnamese asylum seekers who were fleeing from the Vietnam War, and some say that we even have to go back to the history of asylum seekers in the Second World War to properly understand not just the current issue in Australia, but also across the world.  However, for the sake of simplicity, I would have a quick read on Paul Keating's policy of mandatory detention in Australia. Then I would suggest looking at the Tampa Affair and John Howard's 'Pacific Solution'. The Tampa Affair happened in August of 2001, when Australia refused to allow a Norwegian ship called Tampa (which carried more than 400 rescued refugees, many of whom were of Hazara persecuted ethnic minority) to enter Australian waters. This caused a lot of controversy nationally and internationally, and there was much debate regarding the ethics and the legality of such an action. The government introduced the Pacific Solution, which was to transfer maritime-arrival asylum seekers to Nauru and other Pacific islands for detention.  The Pacific Solution 'succeeded' in the number of boat arrivals of asylum seekers fell very very low due to the policy. Some claim that this deterred people smugglers, and thus was good policy - the general Australian public perception seems to be that the Pacific Solution stopped illegals and people smugglers from maybe 'invading' Australia en masse, or that it helped to reinforce or defend our borders. Others thought that this was very inhumane policy in that it failed to take into account that many asylum seekers have been found to be genuine refugees.  Under the Rudd's Labor administration, the Australian government got rid of the Pacific Solution. While asylum seekers who were found to be genuine refugees (most of them) were resettled quickly in Australia, the number of asylum seeking claims rose to the thousands (around three thousand) in 2009, and Rudd's position on the issue was seen as too weak. Rudd tried to introduce an Indonesian Solution, where the asylum seekers would be processed and resettled in Indonesia, however this failed. When Gillard came into power, her government implemented a policy of regional offshore detention, and she reopened Nauru and Manus Island detention centres to detain and process asylum seekers. By this time, the asylum seeking claims in Australia had become around 17,000 in 2012, and there was a backlog of asylum claims created by the lacking facilities of the detention centres.  Once Rudd had (briefly) 'resumed' leadership, his government sought a Papua New Guinea Solution, where asylum seekers who come to Australia would be sent to PNG to be processed - if they were found to be genuine refugees, they would be settled in PNG, but they would not be able to seek asylum in Australia. Again, as with all these policies, there were those on both sides who said that this was a good policy, and those who said it was a bad policy - some said it was not tough enough, and some said that it was inhumane and too harsh.  Now with Abbott's Operation Sovereign Borders, to my understanding, Australia disallows any illegal maritime vehicle or arrivals to enter Australian waters, involving actually 'turning back' boats (if I'm not mistaken). Operation Sovereign Borders has allegedly resulted in 'illegal maritime arrivals' being reduced to nearly zero. However, there is of course controversy related to Operation Sovereign Borders. There is very little media coverage of this, as the government has kept the operations quite secret. Here's a bit of a run-down of recent controversies:   Australia Human Rights Commissioner Gillian Triggs' release of information on children in detention, which is critical of the current policy. The government has perceived this have been a partisan move, and has called for Triggs to resign, while others have defended her for her integrity in exposing these issues. Asylum seekers protesting in detention intensifies, with many going on hunger strikes and some literally sewing their lips together in protest Allegedly, there have been some instances when officials have paid for people smugglers to turn around their own boats back to where they had embarked (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-12/burnside-paying-off-the-people-smugglers/6541888) Whistleblowers on Wilson Security at Nauru detention centre - there have been accusations from whistleblowers of abuse of power and cover-ups (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-04/nauru-whistleblower-details-allegations-against-wilson-security/6478492) Sarah Hanson-Young (the Greens MP) allegedly being spied upon during her visit to Nauru Asylum seekers drowning in the Mediterranean, and the debate in Europe about this   My personal thoughts: I think many may be neglecting the humane aspects of this issue. Here are some sources on the stories of asylum seekers (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-19/first-week-in-australia-refugees-tell-their-stories/6552476) (http://www.amnesty.org.au/refugees/archive/C12/)  Also, we need the public to understand the difference between asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants: (http://www.racismnoway.com.au/teaching-resources/factsheets/44.html)  Australia is a country founded on the ideals of egalitarianism and giving everyone a 'fair go', and it saddens me a bit to see perhaps a lack of compassion or empathy for the suffering of some others. Yet on the other hand, I believe that Australia is a country best equipped to right herself and to do the right thing, so I am optimistic for future change.  I hope this post is of some help!"
AustralianPolitics,3d8ess,derfudid,2,Tue Jul 14 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"thanks so much for the reply. Ive been trying to find reasons on  how people can justify the detention centres on Manus island and Nauru but for the life of me cannot find anything thats not biased heavily. can you please help me understand the justifications for these detention centres and the costs associated - specifically the 250-400k p/a mentioned here and here?  furthermore, what do you think is the major source of many peoples hostility towards settling refugees and asylum seekers in australia? is it nationalism and xenophobia or are there more complex issues that im not seeing?"
AustralianPolitics,3d8ess,derfudid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:38 2015 UTC,"In reply to the specific $250,000-400,000 what I understand from the articles would be that the government claims that offshore processing of asylum seekers is cheaper and maybe better (ie. more 'secure') than onshore processing (on mainland Oz). As pointed out by your first link (http://www.refugeeaction.org.au/?page_id=3447), it is a lot cheaper to process in Australian detention (around $250,000), or even letting asylum seekers into communities while processing claims, rather than the offshore detention policy which we have right now (around $400,000). This first link attempts to highlight the hypocrisy of the so-called 'economic benefits' of offshore processing. The second article from Julian Burnside (http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/youve-been-misled-on-boat-people-here-are-the-facts-20130718-2q5rv.html) illuminates other common arguments against our current policy, and provides some good rebuttal. For example, he points out that we are signatory to the Refugee Convention while our neighbour Indonesia is not - and so he seeks to show us that we may be endangering asylum seekers relinquishing our responsibility to other countries.  I recommend a book written on this subject which attempts to highlight fallacies in our current policies through some legal arguments (and just everyday facts) in a simple and clear manner. It's ""Refugees: Why Seeking Asylum is Legal and Australia's Policies are Not"" by Jane McAdam and Fiona Chong (https://www.newsouthbooks.com.au/books/facts-about-refugees/).  As to general reasons on how people can justify the detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru, I believe that perhaps many people may not know (or don't want to know?) the horrific conditions of detention there, or why so many asylum seekers are coming to Australia. Maybe some think that offshore processing is safer? Maybe it's an issue of ""out of sight, out of mind""? Regardless of what the reason may be for this, it seems both sides of politics believe that they can benefit from continuing this, as it still seems like a relatively popular policy. Populism and democracy isn't necessarily a good thing, especially if the public is misinformed or ill-informed.  What is the major source of many people's hostility towards settling refugees in Australia? This is a tough question. In my opinion, the largest factor is probably misinformation or lack of informed discussion in general. It doesn't help that Operation Sovereign Borders seems to have a blanket of near-silence over the media. Rhetoric (euphemism: border security, operational matters etc.) and overused arguments in social discussions also clouds the issue and dumbs down the intellecual discussion we should all be having. I think all groups (especially those who know better than to abuse their positions of power in public discourse) should refrain from clichés (and ad-hominems) such as say ""asylum seekers are queue-jumpers"" or ""Tony Abbott is the new Hitler"" and the classic ""lefties are self-hating commie Aussies"" or ""right-wingnuts inbred nazi neanderthals"". Public discourse should be productive.  Of course, xenophobia does sometimes play a factor in this. It's a historical tendency that can be noticed in Australia and many other nations (well, naturally nationalism is like that; does that mean nationalism is bad? I don't necessarily think so, but that's another story) to be of course hostile to 'new arrivals'. The asylum seeker issue is also compounded and affected by other issues such as the issue of integration, the nature of a global world and multiculturalism, a sluggish economy, terrorism, among other things. For instance, many asylum seekers are Hazara ethnicity, who live in the Afghanistan Pakistan area (correct me if I'm wrong), and this may also add to the fears of some Australians.  Well, also, we have to consider that accepting asylum seekers (or even a question of migration) is bothering (and has historically bothered) many countries in the world. For example, there are many anti-immigration movements in places such as UK, France, Germany, the US, and generally all over the place. The history of refugees is also checkered (look at the displacement of many European Jews before, during, and after WWII, for example). So this is not necessarily a new problem.  Something which I've been thinking about some time - do any of you guys think that Australia may also be suffering from a bit of an identity crisis of sorts? We know our broad values such as giving everyone a fair go, mateship, sacrifice, and courage, but perhaps we are struggling to grasp who we want to be and who we want to be in the future? For example, the values of the US seem to be easily (and perhaps misleadingly) described by 'freedom and individuality'. Does Australia need more of a vision of where we want to go?  It is important to discuss and debate these sorts of issues on an issue-on-issue basis (in an informed and patient manner, of course). But I also think that we need new 'big ideas' for where we want Australia to go. Who knows, maybe in we can help to do this in /r/australianpolitics or /r/australia  EDIT: Sorry for this long post! I'm not used to writing short (or speaking short, for that matter)."

I have been personally frustrated by how the media doesn't cover dissent and how apathetic people seem to be about organising anything. At first blush (and I would really like to get more responses) it looks as though people are amenable to contacting local representatives, attending rallies and using social media. So, perhaps social media campaigns first, then local rep contact days and after that, co-ordinated live events. I am prepared to be prooven wrong, but the idea of a co-ordinated, national, day of protests appeals to me. I would like a way for people to participate wherever in Australia they are. So small events in regional areas with live feeds to larger events in capitals would be my long term aim. But, yeah. Different people may have different ideas. Numbers are important first. :-)"

The tone of the build up social media campaign also needs to be carefully crafted, I believe it needs to be more educational rather than a smear campaign or in favour of one particular party."

I'd guess that there's about 25 - 30% of the electorate that actually like the current liberal narrative (boat people, economic austerity, helping big business as job creators, old economy < environment, etc...) & this is reflected in the poles at Abbots lowest where he bottomed out at.  With that said, consistent protest & or dissent will grind them down slowly & will get the more moderates to jump ship, once this starts happening then the Lib's will dump both Abbot & their more shitty policies to try to save what they can at the next election."
AustralianPolitics,3d48fv,snuffy69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:08:30 2015 UTC,"I would prefer that rallies are issues based rather than party or personality based, tbh. If the public responds purely to an issue, then I believe that there is less chance of the action being dismissed as 'politically motivated' or 'populist'. In addition to that, the opposition has allowed a reasonable number of unpopular changes to take place, so many issues are beyond campaigning against party politics at this point anyway. Where that is true, issue campaigning is an option. I guess that you run the risk of alienating a chunk of people who are frustrated but not wholey convinced by a particular issue. I guess I'd lean towards a really broad issue, like the culture of secrecy and dismissal of public opinions and use examples from issues such as asylum seekers/nbn/climate change to illustrate the problem. The aim would be to unite people under a really broad issue but still engage them by using examples from the issues that really matter to them. I hope that makes sense!"

There's a problem with the way FB prioritise posts. Build up and awareness is key- the mistake is relying too heavily on one outlet. I know that it costs money, but posters and newspapers are still, albeit old school, options.

I frequently hear left leaning people state that the only thing they admire about John Howard was that he ""Got rid of guns from Australia "" He did nothing of the sort. Australia is awash with guns. The Howard era laws banned semi automatic rifles and shotguns. You can still buy all kinds of lever, pump and bolt action  rifles, and whilst there are some tedious requirements, semi auto handguns are available to serious sporting shooters. Really its just assault rifles and auto loading shotguns that are hard to own. The gun laws aren't what is causing the low level of gun violence in Australia.

There are millions of registered firearms and an unknown but very large number of illegally held firearms in Australia. If you want a gun, you can get one fairly simply. And many many people have done so. Yet our rate of gun violence is very low. Its not the gun laws that are keeping the mass murderers at bay. Something else is keeping us relatively safe. Could be culture, better mental health services, I'm not sure. But access to firearms is not hard in Australia."
AustralianPolitics,3d3v8o,blamedolphin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:54:38 2015 UTC,"Results  In the 18 years before the gun law reforms, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia, and none in the 10.5 years afterwards. Declines in firearm‐related deaths before the law reforms accelerated after the reforms for total firearm deaths (p = 0.04), firearm suicides (p = 0.007) and firearm homicides (p = 0.15), but not for the smallest category of unintentional firearm deaths, which increased. No evidence of substitution effect for suicides or homicides was observed. The rates per 100 000 of total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides all at least doubled their existing rates of decline after the revised gun laws.  Conclusions  Australia's 1996 gun law reforms were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. Total homicide rates followed the same pattern. Removing large numbers of rapid‐firing firearms from civilians may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides.  Source  EDIT: my personal stance is that as a society we shifted our views on the matter & gun-control was simply a part of it, but the reduction in suicides is always a plus :)"
AustralianPolitics,3d3v8o,Fulrem,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that the hiatus in mass shootings in Australia coinciding with the gun buy back is very interesting, but extremely powerful weaponry remains quite freely available to anyone prepared to go through the process of obtaining a licence. This process is time consuming and somewhat costly but not a serious barrier to firearm acquisition. The genuine reason is actually a bit of a box tick. Once a licence is obtained weapons perfectly capable of carrying out Bryant style atrocities are yours for the taking. Yet we have not seen a similar mass shooting for many years. The mass shooting epidemic the US suffers from is also not seen in other countries with high levels of firearm ownership.  To summarise, the current Australian firearm laws do not represent a serious barrier to accessing weapons of potential enormous destructive power. Pump action rifles, Military bolt action rifles, lever action shotguns and rifles are all available to the licenced shooter. Whatever is stopping mass killings in Australia, it isnt a question of hardware."
AustralianPolitics,3d3v8o,blamedolphin,3,Tue Jul 14 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I think having the background check (for mental health issues etc) has been valuable to prevent some violence & arguably mass-shootings, and regulations like using multiple safes can help crimes of passion (enough time to think ""WTF am I doing?"") but that isn't mass-shooting related anyway. Awareness, training, and education has probably been the key in my opinion."

AustralianPolitics,3d3b7z,davidonformosa,2,Mon Jul 13 04:36:31 2015 UTC,"I replied on the site itself but will post my response here in case anyone wishes to discuss it:  Hi John,   I think you make some excellent points and your suggestions are certainly sensible, but I also think there is a bigger beast to slay. The problems we have now are no more 'wicked' than any we have had in the past, however, we certainly need to adopt more modern explanations so that we can navigate their 'complex interdependencies'. I suggest the root of the problem comes from our obsession with the who-should-rule question, and our lack of innovation in policy-making, which can be improved once we understand a little more about where policy comes from.   Furthermore it does no more good to lament the issues we face: there will always be problems, and we will always have to solve them, and because of that we will always have such 'wicked' problems of increasing complexity, and 'contradictory ... requirements'. These point to nothing more than our systems themselves requiring improvement. Jones speaks of these 'wicked' problems as though the problem is some how to blame, but there is nothing inherently wicked about the universe or the problems it challenges us with, and there is a simpler (and more reassuring) explanation: some of our explanations are wicked, and more particularly it is bad philosophy that helps create and propagate these wicked things. This is why ""there is no definitive formulation"", and why they have ""no 'stopping rule'"". However, there is hope because when the problem is now how we interact and the ideas we cultivate, and the question becomes ""how do we do away with wicked explanations, and wicked policy?""  I agree that Parliament is where the improvement needs to happen, but to suggest that we could keep electing the same people and achieve superior results cannot possibly fix the problems we face, because our true problem is with how we solve problems. Only by fixing the process of policy creation and removal can we ensure that we are able to avoid the bad explanations that produce bad policy.  Karl Popper suggests a criterion for judging democracies which is both objective and powerful: the quality of a democracy is how easy it is to remove bad policy without violence. Canonical democracy is able to do such a thing, however, we are by no means efficient at it. How are we to define 'bad policy', though? The answer is simple: the ease of varying policy is inversely related to how good it is. If we think about each extreme, it becomes clearer to see why, as a policy that is easy to vary must have little connection to reality, and a policy that is very deeply connected with reality must only have a very small number of possible forms (where any change to the 'why' would take it further from the truth). In actuality it is exceedingly difficult to make a policy so perfect it is impossible to improve upon, however, since our options for policies are diverse and finite, it is easy to compare them, and when no suitable explanation can be found to inspire policy we must create new ones.  This is truly where policy comes from: it is a creative endeavour that comes from our understanding of the world. It is the creation of new options that allows us to solve the wicked problems of today, and thus to 'fix' our parliament we must first 'fix' our method of creating new options. There are good reasons to believe that parties are not the vessel that can take us there, at least not in their current form. I don't doubt that a loosening of political discipline would move us in that direction, but to believe we can do it forever with canonical parties ignores the fact that parties are not the source of good debate or good policy, and thus there must be better methods of creating good policy, and solving wicked problems. I've written about this political philosophy just a few days ago: http://xk.io/2015/07/10/aus-two-party-failed-us/  I contend that if we were able to solve the problem of the explanations behind policy there will be no requirement to educate or train those involved with politics, because those best suited to create novel policy options are already qualified. The question is how to utilize them.  Finally, I'm starting a novel political party in an attempt to address the philosophical issues plaguing our parliament. It doesn't conform to the methods or structures of canonical parties, and may be able to win 6 senate seats with only 1% of the primary vote (with a trick I call the Senate Preference Hack). If you're interested, it is named the Neutral Voting Bloc and the website is http://nvbloc.org/  -- Max"

AustralianPolitics,3d0bfw,jnd-au,6,Sun Jul 12 12:57:10 2015 UTC,"Nope. The office of Prime Minister isn't mentioned in the Constitution, and only exists by convention/tradition. So we can't really have recall elections for the role (which I think is what you're suggesting).  The Prime Minister is however a 'Minister of the Crown' (as are all other ministers), and so only holds the office at the pleasure of the Governor-General. So technically he can be removed from office quite easily, but doing so would cause political chaos (1975 all over again).   Personally I'd love it if we had a elected Governor-General, formalised a lot of these conventions within the Constitution and had recall elections for the G-G, MPs and Senators. But getting such radical changes into the Constitution would be a huge political battle, which I don't think anyone wants to fight.

Informal mechanisms simply don’t engage enough voters to be democratic. Of course, we have such biased media that recalls could end up more as lynch mobs than anything else. More to the point, he is elected as a local representative so only his electorate would be able to recall him. Tony Abbott’s power as Prime Minister stems from his fellow Ministers complying with him and Labor in the Senate voting to keep his government in power (so the GG isn’t going to act contrary to that).

The trend of temperamental and minority-dominated senates has resulted in diminishing the capacity of all-powerful administrations to cause the kind damage currently perceived.   The beauty of our democratic model is that you really don't have to like the PM, cabinet solidarity is relevant and almost effective enough to regulate individuals. Our citizen/media dynamic is such that we can't comprehend the idea of being satisfied with a ceremonial figurehead that ensures the stability an elected, self-interested President could not (ignoring the additional cost of maintaining our implied freedom of political communication by funding presidential elections). The essential function (and use) is the threat of being forced to dismiss a government which loses support. 1975 happened because when a government failed to pass supply bills twice, the double dissolution trigger remained active by not removing those two failed supply bills from the books before the new (Fraser) government came in. That's a minor technical failing, and is the reason we saw such a sensational exercise of executive power by a GG. It appropriately bought about an election, where either party had the opportunity to provide a stable majority.  We don't need anything remotely close to recall powers, beyond those existing for local electorates. Tony Abbott is nothing particularly extreme, except in his capacity to unite the left and centre in disgust. His government is relatively stable. What we need to worry about, is the trend of switching governments at every opportunity."

AustralianPolitics,3crdia,codeman999,5,Fri Jul 10 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a bit harder than that. Even aside from flaws with online voting, a major problem is participation rates. When you hear something like “80%”, really only a few thousand people have been asked. Petitions usually only attract a few thousand (rarely hundreds of thousands) of participants, out of nearly 15 million voters. So to truly say a majority support it and voted for it, you’d need over 7 million votes. We do have a way of getting that kind of turnout: a referendum. But even Ireland only managed 60% for its recent voluntary referendum – it could easily have ended up less than 50%.  Our law could be changed to make referendums easier in Australia. But you wouldn’t want a referendum on every issue because people would just be overwhelmed and would zone out. Don’t forget, parliaments pass hundreds of laws. Also, doing everything via referendum is not necessarily a good idea. There are not 7 million people who know enough to make an informed decision on every issue. That is why we pay people to work as experts in those areas. It can also be argued that our parliament should’ve ended marriage discrimination even if only 8% of the population supported it, let alone 80%, since its job is to look after all citizens not just the majority. Like most things, the knack is to find a balance point.  There are some Australian political parties with platforms that include online voting to control the parties’ policies and voting."
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,jnd-au,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yer it is definitely not an easy thing to introduce, although with all of its difficulties, surely the ability to have an active say in policies and the ability to show our approval or disagreement with decisions made by politicians who are not truly representing the majority must be part of the future of our democracy. Because as far as I can see the current system of picking between sides who aren't held to their election promises, and once in power can implement policies we wouldn't have agreed to just isn't working, especially when the majority of people I know are directly opposed to many of the decisions being made. If not public Internet voting then some sort of systematically peer reviewed evidence by appropriate professionals to support that decisions are the right ones."
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,jnd-au,2,Fri Jul 10 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, finding the balance between direct democracy, representative democracy, and executive administration.  Currently don’t have any binding direct democracy (issue-based voting) other than referendums. We do however pay for evidence through parliamentary committees and government departments, but these are run by politicians and obviously it depends on the question asked, and governments ask the questions that favour their agenda.  The people who can change the laws to enable direct democracy right now are current politicians, who are also the least likely to vote for these reforms. People keep voting for same old same old (75-95% of people just vote [1] for the existing major parties). And to run for election you have to be willing to be a ‘politician’ (basically quit your day job to campaign, etc). There are some who are willing, so getting involved with alternative parties could help."
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,646463,2,Fri Jul 10 04:45:26 2015 UTC,"why in this day and age are we not aloud more say in controversial policies   This is a pretty massive flaw in our current climate. To hold oneself above criticism is to engage in massively flawed philosophy, and pretty endemic of the philosophical issues plaguing canonical democracies.  I'm starting a political party to address those philosophical concerns you have (and others). It's pretty innovative in design and only requires 1% of the primary vote to win ~6 senate seats. It's called the Neutral Voting Bloc if you want to know more.   the easiest options for me seems Internet voting on issues or having a say in the allocation of your own tax money   Agreed, a good first experiment. There is always arrows theorem to consider, which basically says a ballot with more than two options always invokes strategic voting, but as long as we're cautious I don't think calamity would hit. The NVB votes online for everything, using framework similar to what you might have in your head.  I wrote a short (1700) work essay on old-v-new tactics yesterday. http://xk.io/2015/07/10/aus-two-party-failed-us/   Can we make it happen, will it work?    YES! There is at least one way (NVB) though there may be others. There are a few technically-naive solutions out there, like the Direct Democracy Party, but I don't think they have the infrastructure to scale or reach mass engagement.  The NVB addresses participation rates by using Liquid Democracy which has many similar properties to direct democracy but does not involve all the work."

I will check out the NVB more when I get time, but I'm glad to know that there are people moving forward with the idea.  Like you said it would be a good first experiment, obviously we can't expect to do away with politicians and plug our country into an app but everyone else seems to think it would just be to hard and the uneducated public would make the wrong choices, but at least we would have a say, and hey if it doesn't work then we are still exactly where we started. What is your involvement in the NVP of you don't mind me asking."
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,jnd-au,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:36:48 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this the other day and I actually think it is a bad idea.  Its not a bricklayer's job to run the country. It's not a waitresses' job to run the country. And they generally don't have the education to do so. Indeed, it wouldn't work very well if the waitress had to build a house and it wouldn't work very well if the bricklayer had to take orders and deliver meals.  I believe we already have an issue of under informed voting. That issue would only become larger if we ask the uninformed majority their opinion on things they have no education on."
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,646463,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:46:58 2015 UTC,"That's a good point and about the biggest issue I can see with the voting online issue. However a brick layer still has to ask his client what they want built, a waitress has to take customers orders, why shouldn't a person who's job it is to represent people have to ask the people what they want?"
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,q00001,2,Fri Jul 10 07:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don’t think that analogy works at all. In those examples, each person is making a private order for themselves. But government is more about writing the menu for everyone. Democracy is like a committee. There’s no such thing as you just walk in and there’s a magic menu to choose from. I personally think governments should be more about competent administration than ‘politics’, but this doesn’t mean we should always vote directly on every issue. Someone has to choose what questions get asked and what options we choose from: and that’s a job of government (so, back to square one). On the issue of marriage discrimination, the biggest petitions in support of this have nowhere near 7 million voters’ signatures.  Back to your analogy. I think it would be, you want to go to a restaurant but first we need to vote on whether to have a restaurant. Then we need to vote what kind of restaurant it will be. Then, instead of going to the restaurant and placing an order, 14 million people have to vote on what kind of chairs it’ll have, who will be hired as staff, what the prices will be, what font the menu has, etc. And until a majority can agree on the answers, we don’t have a restaurant. In reality, this is unscalable. We have to delegate to government to come up with it. They take public submissions (which is a big task in itself) but many are low quality. And most people don’t know what they like until they try it.  In the end, the delegated group presents us with some options (e.g. what should be the national anthem be, what should be the flag, etc). And governments do this. But most referendums fail because a majority can’t agree enough. Take an issue like becoming a republic: even if a majority agree it’s inevitable, that doesn’t mean anyone’s come up with an actual plan that everyone can agree on, despite copious public submissions. Or an issue like solving indigenous disadvantage, let’s not kid ourselves that somehow voters have a magic solution up their sleeve. In the end, someone has to put solutions together, decide what questions to ask, etc. That’s a function of government. Most people can agree they’re doing it wrong, but so far a majority has not decided to shift to an alternative form. People are taking it upon themselves to create alternatives, but with 85% of people still voting for Lib/Lab, these alternatives are still just a handful of people.  Another option is electoral recalls. In this situation, we still elect a government like now, but we can unelect them if they are doing a bad job. But, people’s opinions about that are heavily influenced by biased media..."

Bricklayers and waitstaff may typically not have the qualifications to know how policy will affect them but they probably do know someone more politically engaged and of similar enough interests to be a suitable delegate.  Liquid Democracy can provide a solution. It also just so happens I'm trying to start a political party to make some institutional change along these lines. Neutral Voting Bloc is the name."

Which (perfectly contradictory) way do you think they will vote?  I challenge you to find another issue, other than the republic, where there wouldn't be a similar potential for contradictory votes such as the above.   I guess the point is that the reason we have government in the first place is that all our lives and all the systems in the country are interconnected.

I'll admit i don't know a great deal about the inner workings of politics but it just seems to me that we are heading to gradual failure, with socioeconomic gaps growing it's obvious that the government is not and has not been looking after its people equally for some time now."
AustralianPolitics,3crdia,646463,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that we shouldn't have more direct democracy, the government should be finding out the opinion of the people much more often than it does. However, there are things that the government shouldn't be bound to, because they are inherently contradictory.   The way to get things to change (e.g. broadening inequlity) isn't to demand the government to listen to online polls. They will ignore them for exactly the reason I said above. What you need to do is actually put your time, money and/or effort on the line to make a change. Support an alternate candidate. Become an alternate candidate.

He was known for chasing people down, yelling ""why won't you talk to us?"" and going through peoples garbage. The ABC turned his methods back on him and he didn't appreciate it at all.  I believe he sued them or John Safran over it.  From Wikipedia: John Safran, an Australian documentarian and media personality, created a television pilot called John Safran: Media Tycoon which was focused on the media industry. It became infamous for a segment where Safran turned up to Martin's house[when?] and harassed him in the tabloid style characteristic of A Current Affair and its peers. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he had spoken to Roger Grant, the then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC. The segment was later played onMedia Watch on ABC[10] and on Enough Rope.[11] Safran went through Martin's garbage and took Shane Paxton (a former A Current Affair story subject) to embarrass Martin.

Christians are the main concern, not Muslims. Muslims won't be so concerned to hear that a predominantly Christian and atheist country is allowing gay marriage.

My understand is that some gay men are often seen as transgender (which can be more permissible in Islam).  Anyway, in my experience, most people don't give a shit what people from other cultures do, unless they see it as cruel or inhumane.  Look at food taboos. No-one complains about the Chinese eating scorpions, even though it's kinda gross for most people. Dog meat festivals get a few raised eyebrows. Indians might think eating beef is cruel, but if you eat with the wrong hand they might just think you're weird.  I'm pretty sure that even if many Indonesians are against gay marriage for Indonesians, they don't care what Australia does.  People tend to lean libertarian when it comes to other countries. No-one really cares if a foreign country legalizes something they think is a victimless crime. People tend to think that foreigners just do weird stuff, and that's their business.  I think Christian countries might see it as a problem, because they worry about it having a domino effect. But only if they see Australia as having a strong cultural influence.

Nobody cares what he thinks anyway. Punching him is arguably defensible on the grounds of provocation, and that's about as far as the matter needs to go.  However if Andrew Bolt or Alan Jones (or worse, Tony Abbott) was to racially vilify people--for example, to make the imputation to their bogan arsehole followers that all Muslims are terrorists, or supporters of terrorism--that does have reasonably foreseeable consequences, up to and including some of those bogan arseholes taking the influential person's comments as a subtle go-ahead to start burning down mosques, dragging Sikhs from their taxis and beating them up, and screaming abuse at women in burqas on the bus.  The key word there is ""influential"". Your speech is as momentuous as your influence, tautologically. The consequences of bogan arseholes making racist comments are not high. The consequences of influential national celebrities making racist comments are high. It forseeably, even intentionally, encourages the bogan arseholes to actual racist actions.  Covering both under the same law, is like the classic conservative maxim ""the rich and poor alike are both forbidden to sleep under bridges"". If you examine the thinking behind that, it amounts to ""the privileged have the right to use their privileges to their full extent"". If a company can engage expensive lawyers to defeat a plaintiff's case by delay until the plaintiff dies, then they are entitled to do so. If a billionaire can pay to have a mine declared ""not polluting"", then they are entitled to do so.

AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,holman8a,2,Wed Jul 1 10:50:53 2015 UTC,"A couple of reasons.  1) The Sri Lankan navy used to (according to some reports, still does) sink asylum seeker vessels trying to pass between Sri Lanka and India.  2) India is not a Refugee Convention country. Sri Lankans are held in ""Special Camps"" and are subject to indefinite detention. Human rights abuses in the camps are reported to be rife, but the Indian government refuses to let the UN or NGOs access them.  3) Australia isn't actually as far as it looks on a map. Keep in mind, Christmas Island is Australia. Direct the distance is about 3,500km. If you draw a 3500km radius around Sri Lanka by sea, I'm not sure you'd hit another convention country.  The idea solution would be that the international community grew some stones and demanded Sri Lanka reform. A close second would be to get so-called 'transit countries' to sign the convention, or at least agree to set up regional re-settlement projects (Like the Malaysia Solution, which would have seen a regional agreement to process asylum seekers in Malaysia, paid for by funding from a joint conglomerate of countries in the region).  The reality is that the sea crossing - in the vessels they are using - is very dangerous, and we don't want people making it. The two questions are, how do we balance the incentives/disincentives for that journey, and what do we do with people who make it anyway?  My view is that the disincentive for making the journey (there's a good chance you'll drown) is already pretty high. Increasing 'disincentives' is going to have a seriously diminishing rate of returns. If people are willing to risk drowning, then we'd have to have incredibly serious 'disincentives' to make them not take the journey. This is essentially the LNP's policy; make offshore detention so cruel that it will act as an even stronger disincentive than drowning. Obviously, that requires us to treat people in a pretty awful way, so it's not a great solution.  The other option is to incentivise other options. So if there's a good, well funded, well-run refugee camp in Indonesia or Malaysia where people are processed rapidly and sent on to other countries, then that starts to looks like a much better option than getting on an unseaworthy boat and rolling the dice on drowning. So if that option - which currently isn't available - was, then we'd expect to see far fewer people opting to attempt dangerous sea crossings.  If we had good, well-funded and efficient regional processing centres, then in those circumstances, I probably wouldn't be averse to taking people who arrive in Australia seeking asylum - either by boat or by plane - and saying, no look the queue starts in these centres, you have to go back there. (Currently, however, there is no queue. That's the central problem that needs to be fixed.) Keep in mind, however, that those returns 1) wouldn't be by boat, because, of course, the whole point is to take people out of unseaworthy vessels, and 2) they wouldn't be to the government that people are fleeing.   This was the recommendation of the expert panel a few years back. Those recommendations weren't perfect, but the whole situation is ugly and a perfect solution probably isn't possible. Essentially they recommended that we negotiate to set up a full regional approach.  That approach has never been trialled. Instead the government has only ever taken a piecemeal approach, for a whole series of tawdry short-term political reasons. While my view is that the LNP have been particularly obnoxious on this, I don't shy away from the fact that the ALP have also fucked up really badly, and should be doing much better.  The take-away message should be two things. Firstly that lots of the assumptions people brign to the table about asylum seekers (eg. that there currently is a queue) aren't correct. Secondly, if you want to 'stop the boats' - and Abbott hasn't stopped the boats, he's still having to pay people smugglers to turn around - there are sensible, effective options to achieve that. The choice aren't just 'what we're doing now' or 'flood of asylum seekers, many of whom will drown'. We can be less cruel and still achieve the same result (fewer boat crossings), if our politicians are willing to be more courageous on this than they have been."
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,TheEvilSloth,2,Thu Jul 2 05:51:49 2015 UTC,Thanks mate. Probably the most logical argument I've seen on the issue. For starters didn't realise Christmas Island was so far away from Aus! That makes a lot more sense..
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,holman8a,0,Thu Jul 2 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"1994, so the event occurred during either the Hawke or Keating government.  The long bows you draw are pathetic."
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,freetogoodhome__,2,Wed Jul 1 04:34:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, so which of these civilian massacres perpetrated by the Sri Lankan government is recent enough for you?  Do the ones in 2000 count? 2009? 2013?  As an aside, have you ever made a post on this sub that wasn't demonstrative of your deep ignorance of the topic at hand?  I ask because I can't remember a single thing you've said that hasn't been either simply factually incorrect, or laughably demonstrative of a total ignorance."
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,TheEvilSloth,-1,Wed Jul 1 04:43:31 2015 UTC,So the little war thing that was going on was the Abbott government (or Howard's) fault.  Your hate make you very irrational.
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,freetogoodhome__,3,Wed Jul 1 04:48:03 2015 UTC,"Again, if you read the actual words I wrote you would see that I said specifically that it would be silly to blame Australia for Sri Lanka's civil war. It's right there in a comment until his thread - do you need me to cut and paste it here for you?  Tell me - why do you think it is acceptable for the Australian government to physically hand Tamil asylum seekers back to the military they are fleeing? A military that is alleged to have systematically engaged in crimes against humanity?"
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,TheEvilSloth,-2,Wed Jul 1 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"If those ""asylum seekers' were involved in the conflict and committed acts of terrorism, do you think that they will become harmless citizens in this nation?  The question of how they may act in our nation, will they continue to act as displaced combatants against the recognised government, a government that has declared the actions against Tamils over, and who are trying to rebuild after decades of conflict. Do we want or need those people within our borders. Why are we responsible for them when mainland India has already a Tamil population with whom they could settle.  Why would they head here, instead of just next door to India? Are they that out of favour within their own community that they are unacceptable to them. If so, why should we be welcoming those who are not even accepted by their own brethren.   Australia should not be required to solve every problem in the world, especially ones where many of the main actors have shown a willing disregard for the human rights of others."

I agree, and we should absolutely have robust processes for engaging in security checks. We should even - gasp! - hold people in detention while those checks are ongoing, where there are serious security concerns!  None of that, however, answers the question. And it was a direct question, and it is very interesting that you are trying to dodge it.  Please explain why you think it is acceptable for Australia to hand asylum seekers back to the Sri Lankan military. The military that is deeply implicated in crimes against humanity.   Out of all the other approaches we might take, why is that action - the one actually taken by our government - acceptable?"
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,TheEvilSloth,0,Wed Jul 1 05:07:59 2015 UTC,"No, not trying to dodge it. I said they should go back or go to India. They are not our problem and never should be.  If they military are that bad, why do we not see protests like we saw with apartheid in SA. Mainly because those who you believe should be allowed in are seen potentially as war criminals  and so lose sympathy. It is also not my personal responsibility anyway, I am not Tony Abbott and from what I have seen he is doing the best that he can given the positions of the sides in this conflict.  Question for you, what should be done to those who are identified as terrorist agents from the TT. Should they be let free in Australia as they have committed no crime within our borders after they are processed and when let go, are you willing to sponsor and house one of these people."

No, if you come fleeing a genocidal regime, we hand you back to the very military accused of these crimes. Again, check the link. We are physically handing Tamil people, who are fleeing a genocidal regime, back to that country's military.  Our immigration policy is no longer 'off shore detention'. It's ""we will aid and abet crimes against humanity"". As in, our refugee policy has itself literally become a crime against humanity.  I should not be able to say that sentence.

AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,TheEvilSloth,-5,Wed Jul 1 04:24:52 2015 UTC,because you are a smug wanker? Australia doesnt have any control over a civil war in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is in control of their own stability or not in control. If they can't create stability independently what do you think we get our big m8 USA to invade?
AustralianPolitics,3bo0zw,conservador,5,Wed Jul 1 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"Australia does - by definition - have control over the Sri Lankan refugees who seek our protection. It has chosen to exercise that control by handing those asylum seekers back to a military implicated in crimes against humanity.  I agree that the crisis in Sri Lanka isn't one we can solve on our own. I would never suggest it was our fault - that would be absurd. But the choice the Australian government made was to hand people who sought our protection back to the military they were fleeing.  I might well be a smug wanker. That does not for one second change the fact that handing ethnic Tamils back to a military that has engaged in their ethnic cleansing is aiding and abetting a crime against humanity.

Accordingly, Labor rejects the practice of referring to asylum seekers as ‘illegals’.   Oh, look at that; there's a commitment to act in accordance with our international obligations  - which includes a non-refoulement obligation - right there.

Then in the election only one rep out of say 10 parties (that already had a low chance of selecting an asian candidate) is chosen to go to parliament.

If there's a 12% chance of a randomly chosen person being an Asian, then there's a 12% chance of being put on the ballot.  If there's a 12% chance of being put on a ballot, that means that 12% of people on ballots are Asian.  Then we get to the election. If 12% of people on ballots are Asian, assuming ethnicity isn't a reason people vote (it is, unfortunately, but we'll ignore that), then that means 12% of representatives are Asian.  Alternatively, shorter version:  If 12% of the population are Asian, and there's no bias (e.g. maybe Asians don't tend to like politics, or maybe there's discrimination, or in the opposite direction people voting for ""first Asian X""), then 12% of elected representatives WILL be Asian.  It really is as simple as that. Your reasoning is mathematically invalid."

AustralianPolitics,3bjpuw,notepad20,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"Sure. It's actually surprisingly simple, I thought you wouldn't understand it that way so I explained it in words.  Let: C = chance of an Asian being put on a ballot B = chance of someone on a ballot being elected = 1.0 (you can't be elected without being on the ballot) A = chance of an elected representative being an Asian. P = chance of a randomly selected person from the general public being Asian = 0.12, we've agreed on that.  Now A = B * C (see definition of variables) = 1.0 * C = C  C = P (candidate is chosen from the general population, and we're assuming no forms of bias)  Therefore A = C = P = 0.12  QED  Edit: Honestly I've run out of shits to give about this.

You might say ""the libs would just repeal"" but if the policy has been going for 3 years and works that could be quite risky for them as a % of the public would now support it. Think of the difference between opposing a new a tax cut, welfare program or law and moving to repeal it... the pressure is more on the passer/repealer not the opposer/anti-repealer."

By the same token it's a huge stretch to hold Tone accountable for the actions of fringe nutjobs threatening the ABC.   To me this whole discussion is just bizarre.

But saying heads should roll is not criticising the way people speak, it’s saying that heads should roll, which is a deliberately inciteful comment and piggybacks on the actual vigilante beheadings done by the organisations under discussion. Just as violent people are responsible for their own actions, so is Abbott for his. While the extent of the discussion is bizarre, it is also a hallmark of the culture that Abbott fosters (of banging on relentlessly). But he is neither the first nor the last influential person to be criticised for inappropriate comments. Even public figures of debatable influence, like Clive Palmer, have been criticised for saying e.g. that people should commit suicide. More to the point, implication of saying heads should roll is also inappropriate, disproportionate, and aggressive. If Abbott had said something like “there should be a lot of pink slips at the ABC right now” (on top of all his other comments about this), it would have been tame and relevant, but still arguably an inappropriate display of editorial interference. Abbott’s common line is “ABC should have a long hard look at itself”, but he chose to say something inflammatory instead."

Just mostly.  Something useful to do in life is extremely beneficial to people with mental health problems. Many mental health problems (including those that Morrison has overseen the infliction of, in the concentration camps) derive from not having anything useful to do. Aside from the economic disadvantages, which are a whole other contributing factor to mental health problems, having nothing to do (even if one is financially independent) creates a sense of personal worthlessness and disconnection from society. This is one of the reasons early-retirees often die sooner, and the idle children of the investor rich are such fuckups.  A major contributor to both problems, is the reductionism of human value to human work; these fuckwads and their water-carriers value people only to the extent that those people work. Contribution to society is irrelevant; contribution to the economy is what they care about.  Yes, getting a job would help a lot of mentally ill people. However, Morrison has the cause and effect the wrong way around. There aren't enough jobs. No matter how loudly they insist that people must work, that to not work renders a person worthless, no matter how horrible they make the consequences of not having a job, none of this means jack shit.  There aren't enough jobs. There definitely aren't enough jobs in which mental illness can be reasonably accommodated. Heavens, no. The attitude of employers (which Morrison and his fellow creeps applaud) is, obey or fuck off; there are a hundred other people who will replace you. So no, Morrison, the guy who sometimes turns up late or goes and has a cry in the toilets, is not going to be able to keep a job in this economy. As you know.  The reason why is simple. Under the watch of Keating, Howard, Rudd/Gillard/Rudd and now Abbott, the finance industry and the property industry have sucked most of the money away from job-producing investments, ie small business. Take a tour of any major city and look at all the commercial properties for lease. Look at the businesses for sale - they're all terrible businesses where the people are desperate to get out.  There aren't enough jobs, and this is going to keep happening and it will get worse until the risk/return profile of the finance industry is forced down to make business more attractive, and/or the property bubble bursts."

The closest it comes is that  ""All applicants must have achieved academic standing sufficiently advanced to assure completion of a bachelor's degree by the October following election. Academic standing must be sufficiently high to ensure admission to the University of Oxford, which has very competitive entry requirements, and to give confidence that Rhodes Scholars will perform to a high academic standard in Oxford. Individual constituencies may specify a 1st or equivalent.  Some constituencies require an undergraduate degree to have been taken within the constituency of application.""  You don't need to be smart to get good grades.  While you point to the fact that he was awarded this as a sign that he is smart, I point to the fact that he has constantly aimed for the lowest common denominator politically and is always a poor performer when giving long form interviews.

If academic achievement isn't an indicator of intelligence then what is?     Nothing in there says anything about having to be really smart in order to be awarded with one.     Literally the first selection criteria is ""literary and scholastic attainments"".     You can not, with a straight face, tell me this is a smart man https://youtu.be/9wT9XS_TvzQ?t=34s    That's ridiculous.

AustralianPolitics,3bah7r,DosShashliks,4,Sun Jun 28 05:02:02 2015 UTC,"Academic achievement has never been an indicator of intelligence, it's an indicator of whether or not you studied and remembered what you needed to remember in order to answer the questions in assignments and exams.  Yes, literary and scholastic attainments. IE: you did well in exams. Again, not a measure of how smart you are.  You can cherry pick? Go on then. This is 30 seconds of complete silence where the man couldn't come up with anything to say aside from ""I've given you the answer that you deserve"".

The ability to see an issue or problem from a different perspective in order to gain new information would be another. Hell, being hungry for new information would be a big one too. If you have no interest in learning new things then I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're not very bright.  This is a man that wants to shut down wind turbines because he doesn't like the look of them and thinks they're noisy, completely oblivious of the hypocrisy over his statements of the coal industry. This is a man that has trouble with pattern recognition.  You're a Greens voter? Oh yeah, which Greens policies do you support? Which Lib policies do you support?"

To me it makes more sense to disagree with his policies or ideology rather than becoming upset when someone suggests that he's not literally stupid. Hell, if you manage to do that you might even be able to engage with/understand the perspective of his supporters.  It's none of your business but I support most of the Greens policies, my main exceptions would be their calling for a moratorium on GMOs and nuclear technologies."

His background and the simple fact that he has risen to where he is would tend to support the idea that he has quite a bit going on between his ears. However, it is precisely because he is not a moron that makes him so repugnant to me. His manipulative scaremongering, his disregard for the rule of law and his Luddite approach to renewables, all of these are done with full awareness. He seems as if he will do absolutely anything to keep and extend his political power, for no other purpose than power itself. He knows better and chooses to go for the lowest common denominator, to scare people about the Islamic bogeyman under the bed and to mortgage the future of our country to make a quick buck and keep lining the pockets of his cronies. Because he is aware of what he is doing, it makes him far worse than if he were ignorant. A stupid person makes bad decisions because they don't know any better, a bad person knows better but continues regardless. Tony Abbot is a smart man, but rather than impress me, that fact just fills me with a profound disgust."

The title says low and middle-income earners are having their pensions cut, but the article linked says only those with significant will have reduced pensions, while those under $400K will actually get increased ones:   The Coalition, which has won support from the Greens, expects to save $2.4 billion over four years by reducing payments for pensioners with significant assets outside the family home, but increasing the amount received by those with moderate levels of assets below $400,000.   The only drawback mentioned is that pensioners would spend their assets, though I'm not sure why this is a bad thing."

AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,LordRoke,7,Fri Jun 26 03:29:10 2015 UTC,"Left/Right are relative terms. So you need to define society's centre before even attempting to answer this question.   Right wing media, which is nearly everything in Australia, will always claim it is Left leaning because to them it is. Online forums, like Reddit, tend to be left leaning so can see many right wing influences.  Any political debates(ABC, TV or elsewhere) tend to be progressively influenced as conservatism benefits from no debate at all, which maintains the status quo. Can't change without discussion."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,martyoz,5,Fri Jun 26 05:38:34 2015 UTC,"Left/Right are relative terms.   I'm going to disagree (maybe I'm high-functioning ODD or something).  Although Left-Right is a simplification (a three-axis description is a little better), Left and Right have core ideological positions that can be sensibly associated with them. The Left is in favour of collective solutions, equality, government, taxation, trade unions, progressive social reforms. The Right is in favour of freedom, business, small government, established social values, individual contracts, low taxes. If a media outlet consistently aligns itself with particular values, it can be described as Left or Right, regardless of the social environment that it operates in.  Applying this idea, I would conclude that the ABC is moderately Right, but certainly to the Left of all privately owned Australian media, the ALP and the LNP.  Conservatism benefits from controlled debate that builds an illusion that everyone agrees. People will tell you that you can't think 'that' (whatever 'that' is) because it's crazy ... they live in a social reality that's a media construct. For example, in this country there is a constant debate about whether the ALP or the LNP should be in control. That's an extremely limited debate that benefits conservatism.  When a genuinely different point of view escapes into the media people go bat-shit crazy."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,Ainsley_Reed,2,Sat Jun 27 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"So conservative media functions by creating a social bubble?

AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,mofosyne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's undeniable that people seek out media that reinforce their view of the world. Left wingers do that too, I do, and I am also driven by outrage. The difference is the power that is lined up behind corporate media and the way they can swamp alternative views. The same thing can happen in a leftist society e.g. Pravda, and when it does that isn't any better."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,Ainsley_Reed,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"yea I totally agree. It can go both ways (via corporate media via right, or state media via left... or both in some cases?). It's a problem either way, so we do need to find a solution or at least a way to mitigate the issue.  It's always sad to see people transformed into those kinds of drones who are constantly primed for outrage, and is always full of negative energy. Once it takes holds, much like problem gambling... it consumes you and is very hard to wean off. (And ultimately affects you, your family, and society... much like compulsive gamblers.)  It's a mental health epidemic."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,mofosyne,3,Sat Jun 27 03:10:13 2015 UTC,Excellent point - they are relative terms and the they shift over time - it seems that the centre ground has shifted to the right since the 80s and the Regan / Thatcher era - trickle down economics etc.  Coming from UK the ABC reminds me of most the positive points of the BBC. I fear that the Government here as the same agenda as the Tory Government in the UK - to undermine the ABC in any way possible.
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,gnarwar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:01:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think the terms are relative, so much as people don't apply them correctly or with any rigor. Left and right refer to clear ideological differences, as someone has already pointed out."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,martyoz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"Left-Right is a reference to where you sit compared to centrist views.  Progressive-Conservative-Regressive are ideologies.  In a progressive tending society, issues move from the left to right. In a regressive society, once acceptable issues become left wing again.  Interracial marriage was a left wing issue in the past. It is now conservative. There are some who would love to see it outlawed again, they are regressive.  When a new topic arises your ideology will define your response as either Progressive or conservative. Societies response will define whether you are left or right."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,gnarwar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Left, right and even centre are distinguished by different views and beliefs of society, which in turn correspond to various ideologies. For example, anarchism, socialism and modern liberalism on the left, and classical liberalism and conservatism on the right. Centrist views (the third way) also correspond to certain values and beliefs, although they are not as clearly or coherently articulated as left/right. It is only by misrepresenting the position that you could claim they are relative, as this detaches them from the views and beliefs that make the political spectrum what it is. Furthermore, centrist views are themselves a response to the ideologies associated with left and right, not the other way around. Thus, if left and right refer to clearly demarcated strains of thought then the centre must as well.  In my experience, progressivism and regressivism are rather broad terms that lack the same sort of definitional accuracy as socialism or conservatism. For this reason, they are less helpful in identifying one's position as left or right than other ideologies. I even think an argument questioning the status of progressivism and regressivism as ideologies is possible. For instance, progressives may describe the world and prescribe how the world ought to be in different ways, which makes it rather incoherent as an ideology.  Finally, whether an individual issue is considered left or right will vary, sure, but this doesn't mean that the left/right divide doesn't refer to ideological positions with clear differences. In the case of interracial marriage, whilst it may be accepted by some contemporary conservatives, certainly not all, this doesn't mean it is opposed by modern liberals. Supporting interracial marriage isn't what makes you conservative or liberal, it's the reasons behind your support, on which both ideologies will still differ. Thus, an issue can lose it's status as a left or right issue as society develops, but the thought, or ideas, behind the issue will remain the same for both sides."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,martyoz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:46:05 2015 UTC,"Left-Right is literally where you sit in the chamber in relation to the speaker. The speaker can not define your beliefs.  Currently the Liberals have more than 50% of seats so some on the 'left' have conservative views. All this means is we are not as progressive as other nations.  Yes, Left varies. But Progressive can not.  Progress is a direction, Left is a location. Our desire is momentum."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,gnarwar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:59:49 2015 UTC,"The terms left and right derive from the seating arrangements at the first meeting of the Estates-General in 1789 during the French Revolution, but in this context they obviously refer to the political spectrum. Also, if progress is a direction and left is a location, then, by your own logic, progressivism isn't an ideology as it refers to progress in general and not a coherent set of ideas that serve to inform political action.  Also, the LNP aren't left. If anything they are classical liberals, which lean to the right. As I said, left/right refers to ideas, not stances on particular issues. As such, the left/right spectrum clearly serves to demarcate ideological differences that are not in any way relative."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,martyoz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"No, I said Progressivism is an ideology as it refers to progress in general. i.e. not in relation to contemporary standards. Location is meaningless without a frame of reference.  Theoretically elections define the centre. As we have some on the left at the moment, the LNP hold the centrist viewpoint.  However in practice we know external factors heavily influence peoples votes. The last election was very much voting Labor out with little concern for the LNP's intentions. Also no individual is 100% progressive on every issue(assuming they are not all sheep). And minor parties don't sit amongst the 2 majors.  You say the LNP aren't left, but the electorate suggested otherwise. Now you need to determine where the actual centre of societies views really are. Which was my very first statement.  If every member elected were all Greens half would be right-wing because that is the new cross-section of society. The more-progressives(left) vs the less-progressives(right)."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,gnarwar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:23:48 2015 UTC,"Again, the electorate somehow suggesting the LNP is left, or that elections define the centre, is a perfect example of not applying the terms left/right correctly or with any rigor. The terms are not relative as they refer to clear ideological differences of which there is no getting around.  Suggesting that right wingers are only less progressive also implies that progressivism is a spectrum, which further reinforces the point I made earlier about it being so broad as to be rather incoherent as an ideology. In your own words, it refers to progress in general."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,martyoz,0,Sat Jun 27 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"If voters voted purely on their ideologies, left/right could be perfectly discerned by an election. If you think LNP are not lefties, than either your views are out of line with the rest of Australia, or we need to take into account the reasons why and determine the actual line of bias. It may just turn out the average Australian is more right wing than you thought.  Saying the definitions are clear ignores the fact they change on an annual basis. Banning black rights was a left wing issue 100 years ago. Banning gay rights was a left wing issue 1 year ago. Both have changed. You cant attach any ideology to the left or right. (NB.Your term 'ideological differences' is literally a relative term)  Progressivism is a spectrum it goes all the way the to regressive. If you are for black rights but not gay rights, you are less progressive than someone who is.   If all your concerns are dealt with and legalised than you will eventually become a conservative and not want anything to change. We see this all the time."

AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,gnarwar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:12:52 2015 UTC,I saw this and the statistics do point to pretty much equal airtime given to both sides of the political spectrum.  Obviously - no media outlet is unbiased or completely objective as I don't think this is possible but overall the ABC seems to do a pretty good job of telling both sides of the story.
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,doggie015,2,Fri Jun 26 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"I guess the shock to the Government is because they are so used to the Murdoch Press engaging them in a huge circle-jerk, whereas the ABC actually have some balance. When you're surrounded by horribly biased media outlets the one that brings a balance naturally looks the odd one out - if your head is completely stuck up your ass, that is."
AustralianPolitics,3b5ii2,roxas4,3,Sat Jun 27 03:58:49 2015 UTC,If there is any that goes against the independent studies showing that the ABC actually has a slight right-wing bias then I would also like to see it.

AustralianPolitics,3b5hno,Morrosis,5,Fri Jun 26 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"There's two separate questions here. The first is the Tony Abbott 'birther' issue about whether his citizenship status when he was elected was such as to disqualify him from office.  Frankly I think that's a non-issue. If there were a bee's dick of proof that his citizenship rendered him ineligible for office, Malcolm Turnbull would set a land-speed record getting to his office to knife him.  The much more interesting issue is 'would Tony Abbott be considered a dual citizen for the purposes of the new rules on dual nationals?'  The answer to that question appears to be yes. The new bill says:   a person who is a national or citizen of a country other than Australia renounces their Australian citizenship if...   The word 'national' captures Abbott. And everyone else on this list:  Sen Hon Mathias Hubert Paul Cormann  Canada (1) Sen Larissa Joy Waters  China (1) Sen Zhenya (Dio) Wang  France (1) Hon Bernard Ripoll  Germany (1) Sen Hon Eric Abetz  Greece (1) Ms Maria Vamvakinou  Iran (1) Sen Sam Dastyari  Italy (1) Mr Antonio (Tony) Zappia  Malaysia (1) Sen Hon Penny Wong  New Zealand (1) Sen Scott Ludlam  Nigeria (1) Hon Sussan Penelope Ley  Singapore (2) Mr Ian Reginald Goodenough Sen Peter Stuart Whish-Wilson  South Africa (1) Dr Dennis Geoffrey Jensen  United Kingdom (11) Hon Anthony John Abbott Hon Robert Charles Baldwin Sen Hon Douglas Niven Cameron Sen Hon Stephen Michael Conroy Sen Robert John Day Hon Paul William Fletcher Sen Alexander McEachian Gallacher Hon Gary Gray, AO Mrs Karen Jane McNamara Hon Brendan Patrick O'Connor Sen Hon Nigel Gregory Scullion  One odd one is Andrew Nikolic because he's a national of Yugoslavia, which doesn't exist anymore.

AustralianPolitics,3b5hno,jnd-au,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, given that no-one's sued him yet it's functionally equivalent."
AustralianPolitics,3b5hno,TheEvilSloth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"That’s not what 3(2) means though, is it? I read it simply as a statute of limitation which means you can’t sue them if they left parliament more than a year ago."
AustralianPolitics,3b5hno,jnd-au,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:19:15 2015 UTC,"No, I read it that the 'sitting' you're suing for has to have occured, at the latest, 12 months ago. So, since 3(1)(b) says:     $200 for every day, subsequent to that day, on which he or she is proved in the suit to have so sat.   They'd be sued $200 for that day, which was proved in the suit. My reading of 3(2) is that even if that person has sat for 10 years, you can't get them for any time before that 12 months. The key words in 3(2) here are:   relate to any sitting   That is, any day on which they say. So since the penalty is per day ""on which he or she is proved in the suit to have so sat"", and you can't prove sittings prior to 12 months ago because the statute excludes them from the suit, you're limited to 12 months.  Also with the benefit of a re-reading, I think it refers only to actual sitting days of parliament, which would be far fewer than 365. So the full fine is probably capped at more like $30-ish K."
AustralianPolitics,3b5hno,TheEvilSloth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"It may be implied that only ‘sitting days’ of the relevant chamber(s) are counted. You agree with me in your first sentence and then go on a different track. You can sue them while they are sitting, or up to a year after they stopped sitting, and you get $200 flagfall plus $200 per day (until they resign) if they remain sitting during your suit and if your suit is successful. The condition of 3(2) only says that it discounts anything older than “12 months before the day on which the suit is instituted”, not that it discounts the accumulation of penalties in any months thereafter."
AustralianPolitics,3b5hno,jnd-au,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"(1)  Any person who, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, has sat as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives while he or she was a person declared by the Constitution to be incapable of so sitting shall be liable to pay to any person who sues for it in the High Court a sum equal to the total of:      (a)  $200 in respect of his or her having so sat on or before the day on which the originating process in the suit is served on him or her; and      (b)  $200 for every day, subsequent to that day, on which he or she is proved in the suit to have so sat.  (2)  A suit under this section shall not relate to any sitting of a person as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives at a time earlier than 12 months before the day on which the suit is instituted.   OK, so the plain wording of 3(1) applies to 'Any person who ... has sat as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives while he or she was a person declared by the Constitution to be incapable of so sitting'.  That person ""shall be liable to pay to any person who sues for it in the High Court a sum equal to the total of"", and what we're interested in is what is the amount.  The sums noted are:   $200 in respect of his or her having so sat on or before the day on which the originating process in the suit is served on him or her   So you get $200 for the day on which the originating process is served. So I hand the writ to Abbott, if he sat that day, or on any day before that I get $200.  I then also get:   $200 for every day, subsequent to that day, on which he or she is proved in the suit to have so sat.   So you're reading 'proved in the suit' to mean that if I prove Abbott has been sitting since 1994, I get $200 for each sitting day he was present between 1994 and now.  Now, I think 3(2) makes that interpretation not the preferable one. This is because it says:   A suit under this section shall not relate to any sitting of a person ... at a time earlier than 12 months before the day on which the suit is instituted.   That is, the rules of evidence would preclude you from calling evidence that Abbott sat any time more than 12 months after you issue the writ. This is because evidence is only admissible where it relates to the cause of action being determined. The cause of action is limited by 3(2) to sittings within 12 months. Therefore you can't call evidence that he sat earlier than that, because that evidence is irrelevant to the suit - the suit shall not relate to earlier sittings."

He also asked the British Home Office under a Freedom of Information request for evidence Abbott had renounced his British citizenship but they also refused.  If I had to guess I'd say Abbott renounced his British citizenship some time after he entered Parliament, possibly even after he became party leader. The reason being if he had renounced before he entered Parliament there'd be no reason to be so coy about it. It would be damaging if it was revealed now that he was still British when he entered Parliament but he wouldn't actually lose his seat over it, so his office has only said he renounced without revealing any further details."

I detest this Government and most of their policies.
AustralianPolitics,3b5dbt,LordRoke,3,Fri Jun 26 03:26:22 2015 UTC,"Vote ALP in the house; almost across the board the state ALP stance on marijuana is to allow it where it has a medical benefit and is prescribed by a doctor, but not to allow recreational sale. They're also solid on climate change, and would reinstate the RET, probably at a higher level, if they won government.  On disability and pensions generally, the ALP has far and away the stongest stance of the three major parties. The ALP passed th legislation which gave us the National Disability Insurance Scheme which was a huge boon for disabled people and thier carers.  By contrast the Greens have shown a willingness to vote with the LNP to reduce the age pension - that's not the disability pension, let's be fair, but it's not a good sign.  In the senate the question is do you want to hedge your bets? Lots of people vote differently in the house and the senate becuase they want the government to have to negotiate thier outcomes, rather than simply pass whatever laws they like if they secure both houses. If you're not a dyed in the wool party member, it's a fairly sensible position in my view."
AustralianPolitics,3b5dbt,TheEvilSloth,2,Fri Jun 26 16:46:11 2015 UTC,No they want to reduce it for people who already have lots of assets and increase it for people who need it more. That's fine by me.
AustralianPolitics,3b5dbt,TheEvilSloth,0,Sat Jun 27 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"That's simply not true - in fact the Greens material is misleading on this. Firstly, the lowest pensions won't go up. The moderate pensions they say will increase a small amount won't becuase they're already caught by the income test, which runs alongside the assets test and isn't being changed.  Frankly, I think the LNP lied to them and they didn't check the detail; there's a good explanation here: http://ihearttax.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/how-lnp-conned-greens-on-pension-reform.html"

Meh I stopped watching Q&A ages back because you never get any insight. It's the same old pollies giving the same old spin.

Ivan Milat committed some seriously fucked up offences. He was charged, given a fair trial, convicted and sentenced. As a trained lawyer, John Howard should know that people are entitled to a proper process. The claim isn't that Hicks is a hero, or that he did anything right. The claim is that he was denied proper process and put under duress.    John Howard made our country look stupid because he treated Hicks in a way that one would expect to be treated in North Korea... illegal charges and confession under duress. This doesn't make him squeaky clean/heroic. All this does is make our process fucked up.

Well, if you read the article you'd have learned:   Joe Dortch from the University of Western Australia called them “old-fashioned”. He said using the Gwion Gwion rock paintings as evidence of a different race that pre-dated Aboriginal Australians was an “old chestnut that gets repeated” but had no credibility.  Dortch has worked extensively with geneticists and in 2011 was the co-author of the first Aboriginal full-genome study. It showed an unbroken Aboriginal lineage over 2,500 generations, or about 60,000-75,000 years – the longest continuous lineage outside Africa.  “Genetically, there’s very little admixture for 50,000 or more years,” he said. “There are some genetic signals indicating fleeting visits from Asia, but these are very minor in the overall genetic makeup.”  Although new discoveries were always being made, there was no physical or genetic evidence of any changeover in population, he said. Leyonhjelm’s views came from a “political stance” and “that’s why it keeps getting trotted out”.   Anything else from the article you need me to copy/paste for you?"

His view was based on the Bradshaw or Gwion Gwion rock paintings in Western Australia, which some amateur anthropologists in the 1990s theorised were painted by a different ethnic group that was eventually displaced by Aboriginal Australians.

While we are at it; lets block Facebook because Jeff uploaded a photo he downloaded or block Twitter because John reuploaded a video he found on YouTube; actually lets just block YouTube because people can listen to music for free.  Harder to access content, blocked sites, no control over internet privacy and history, slow speeds that are throttled, information about you handed over to copyright holders if they think you did something that harms them and generally a worse internet for Australians.

This is how you connect to a site, through you ISP and the ISP can see what you visited. Now a VPN is designed to connect you to websites but they will stop the ISP from being able to see what you visited and also stop them from being able to block the content. VPN's are cheap, can be slow or fasting depending on price paid and protect your data. They can be used on any device and can be active 24/7 without needing to worry and are also a great way to bypass region restrictions (Such as Netflix) and other US services. TOR is different because TOR encrypts all of its data and runs it through basically 3 VPN's all while the data in encrypted at each step so only you can view the content and no one else can see the path the encrypted data actually took. This is why TOR is used by drug dealers and such but is also very slow and impractical for accessing legit web content."

AustralianPolitics,3anqv1,chessc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:56:27 2015 UTC,Some states have plenty of tax they could raise.   Property tax for one.   They could also charge contain fees for road and parking use.   They could charge registration fees that reflect vehicle value on cars over some threshold.
AustralianPolitics,3anqv1,artsrc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:11:49 2015 UTC,States could even raise their own income tax. E.g. 5% on top of what the commonwealth charges. The govt would only last one term though.  The problem is people already feel they pay enough tax. The issue is it's not being adequately distributed to education and health.

AustralianPolitics,3aocr9,TheEvilSloth,2,Mon Jun 22 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"The changes lift the assets-test free limit for homeowner couples from $286,500 to $375,000 but withdraw the pension much faster than before, by $3 for every $1000 of assets over the limit rather than $1.50.  A supplementary submission to the inquiry by Industry Super says the tables presented with the budget focus on the changes to the pension assets test without acknowledging that access to the pension is also governed by an income test which 'deems' income from assets. The more restrictive test prevails.  Recalculating the government's figures to include both tests, Industry Super finds a homeowner couple with assets of $375,000 would be no better off under the changes, not the $2984 better off as claimed by the government.  ""The gains for pensioners with lower levels of assets are either considerably overestimated or non-existent,"" the submission says."

AustralianPolitics,3alhd8,chessc,15,Sun Jun 21 11:09:32 2015 UTC,Education Minister Christopher Pyne has said the government believes it has a particular responsibility for independent schools that it doesn't have for public schools.    What the holy fucking fuck?  How could our education minister possibly be so fucking retarded?  So they have a particular responsibility for NON GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS.  This is orders of magnitude stupider than anything else I have ever heard from Pyne.
AustralianPolitics,3alhd8,bleakprophet,9,Sun Jun 21 11:41:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on Pyne being retarded -- but some context to his comments.  Keep in mind that the school funding model in Australia is structurally broken.  State governments fund public schools.  The Commonwealth government subsidises private schools (I have no idea of the history of how that arose).  So I think that was what Pyne was referring to.  The reason public education is under such pressure is State government rely on the federal government for their funding (because they collect the taxes), and the federal government, over many decades, keeps squeezing State govt budgets.  The only long term fix, is to fix federation, and unfortunately that's probably not going to happen during our lifetime."
AustralianPolitics,3alhd8,TheEvilSloth,8,Sun Jun 21 12:03:29 2015 UTC,"I have no idea of the history of how that arose   Short answer is schooling at  federation colonization was basically all done by religious orders. When it came for states to fund schools (around 1860-odd) in NSW the Catholics and Anglicans (then Church of England) couldn't decide on the content of a 'general' Christian education. As a circuit breaker, the decided that state schools would be 'secular' in the sense that they wouldn't pick sides between protestants and Catholics - student would be streamed into appropriate religious instruction based on their religion, delivered in school in separate religion classes. Those existing religious schools just continued with only Church funding because ""a building and some religious Sisters/Brothers"" was dirt cheap anyway, and many Catholics and protestants didn't trust the state school system for largely sectarian reasons.  Until about 1950-odd the states were funding some buildings for religious schools, buses for kids, etc but not a whole lot else. There was some tension over increasing funding, with religious schools feeling the pinch of the cost of an increasingly lay staff.  It all came to a head in 1962 when the NSW department of education threatened to close a Catholic Primary School down because it was short 3 boy's toilets. The Parish said they couldn't afford to build them. In the end we had the Goulburn School Strike, where all the Catholic Schools in the region closed and the kids were send to the local public schools. As you can imagine a sudden influx of a huge number of kids they hadn't budgeted on went... poorly.  Funding increased and was standardised for capital works by 1964, Whitlam finalised a federal funding arrangement by 1974.  *edit - I wrote federation, when I should have wrote colonization. I don't even know why."
AustralianPolitics,3alhd8,e-jammer,3,Sun Jun 21 14:43:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks - that's very interesting.  The anecdote of what happened in 1962, when some Catholic schools closed, also shows how difficult it's going to be to untangle."
